"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Cute movie elevated above the mediocre by Pegg and Moran
","Run Fatboy Run - Dennis Doyle (the wonderful Simon Pegg) with commitment issues runs away from his pregnant fiancé (Thandie Newton) on their wedding day and, 5 years later, tries to win her and his son back by running a marathon. Anyone hoping for a Edgar Wright style riff (not an unfair expectation, as this has two cast members from Shaun of the Dead) on the sports genre will be disappointed. This is directed by David Schwimmer, and scripted by Michael Ian Black and Simon Pegg himself. Schwimmer's direction is adequate, and the story is pretty cute, though really by the numbers. Could we just freeze the use of the sports montage for, like, two decades? Pegg is very watchable and his presence is more or less what breathes life into the film. Thankfully he also has Dylan Moran (change of pace from Nick Frost), who lights up any dull moment and steals many scenes from under Simon Pegg's feet. Moran plays a near-do-well friend with a gambling addiction and a strange (but funny) lack of pants.On the other hand, Thandie Newton has pretty much nothing to work with in the material. And Hank Azaria has the virtually thankless task of being the uptight nemesis of Pegg's character (trying to steal the woman Dennis ditched on their wedding day. *What* an ass). God, why do we always have to have a reason to hate the other man (or woman, depending on the film)? Is the theory that any man who is nice and decent on the outside has to be a monster on the inside? God it's such a cliché.In conclusion, see it for Pegg and Moran. B-",6,0,2,13 November 2008
Changeling," Grueling and scary search for truth.
","Changeling - In 1928, Single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home one day to discover her nine-year-old son, Walter, is missing. She calls the police and, after enduring a grueling 24 hours, they search for her son. But the boy they return to her is not her son. After confronting corrupt city authorities, Collins is vilified as an unfit mother and sent to an asylum.This is a grueling film to watch. I have not felt this hideous since North Country, a film which also dealt with misogyny within the power structure. Women are treated as fragile, emotional, and not believable. This film tackles corruption to boot, as the LAPD is accused of being a gang of thugs that answer to no one. Eastwood is old school with the violence, understanding that the mind can fill in the very brutal gaps.Angelina Jolie delivers another great performance. But unlike A Mighty Heart, this film actually deserves her presence. I don't think she really should have so much press coverage, but there is definitely reason for her acclaim as an actress. The situation her character goes through is so surreal and the film captures it perfectly. It gives you chills from the second Christine is given this pretender to raise and rarely lets up. And if for one moment you tell yourself 'It's just a movie' as I tried to, this s*** actually happened. Characters were composited or changed, a disclaimer at the end states, but the events were the same.An odd praise goes out to Jason Butler Harner, who plays Gordon Northcott, a kidnapper and murderer of many children. He has played one of the monsters of everyone's nightmares to perfection. Also of note is Jeffrey Donovan for his portrayal of J. J. Jones, corruption personified. Jones is a man able to whisk people away to asylums with no need of warrants. Scary indeed.Changeling shares a theme with several of Clint Eastwood's other films. Unforgiven and Flags of Our Fathers come most readily to mind. His lesson concerns truth and lies, and exposing the hypocrisy of falsehoods for want of the truth. The truth is rarely pretty, but generally preferable to lies, and will often come to surface, if given enough time. I doubt I will watch this struggle for truth for a long time to come (it's not one for casual viewing), but it's a very good film.A-",9,176,227,2 November 2008
The Incredible Hulk," A pity that the better Hulk movie should come out second.
","The Incredible Hulk - A reboot of the franchise after the Abomination that was 'The Hulk', Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) evades the military after a mixture of Super Soldier serum and gamma radiation turns him into the jolly Green Giant we all love.I didn't like the first movie, for several reasons. It was slow. It was boring. Nick Nolte's heinous over-acting, and Eric Bana's aversion to acting. Oh, and the Poodle. Did I mention the Poodle? Who hasn't? It's become synonymous with the Bat-nipples at this point. While Incredible Hulk is no Batman Begins to Batman and Robin, it stays truer to the roots of the character than it's predecessor, and acknowledges the TV show, a wise move.This film gives the fanbase a little more of what they expect and deserve from a movie about a monster that destroys property. There aren't the Banner-father issues that the first film had and didn't need. There're also more explosions, noise (Jesus is it loud), action, humor and movement. It unfortunately retreads a little too much familiar ground. I've seen the Hulk get chased by the military. I've already seen this love/hate triangle between Ross, Banner and Betty, though it's actually interesting here I read there's a scene where Bruce travels to the North pole and contemplates suicide. Now there's a scene I haven't seen before, and would like to see.The trouble with the Incredible Hulk is unless you're a very very creative writer, The Hulk is a rather two dimensional character. He gets angry and then smashes crap up. The only memorable villain he ever has was The Abomination because the other secret to The Hulk is that he's a better villain (it's taken most of the Marvel universe to bring him down at varying points) than a hero. I applaud Norton for his creativity and the depth he brings to Banner. He also adds vitality and intelligence, whilst Eric Bana was having difficulty grasping the American accent. Liv Tyler adds a sweet sadness to the romantic interest. She is Banner's only connection to humanity when he transforms. Tim Roth plays the heavy pretty well, though I caught him overacting blatantly a couple times. The effects are pretty good and I enjoyed the action sequences.It's unfortunate that the better Hulk movie should come out second (and behind Iron Man no less) which should be a lesson to Hollywood. Put your butts in gear and get it right the first time. Good, not 'Incredible', The Incredible Hulk gets a B.",7,2,4,21 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Mission Unlikable
","Former spy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called back into action to recover a missing IMF Agent. But complications arise when his fiancée is captured and he must fight to get her back.First off, I wanted something fun to turn my brain off to this weekend. I thought an action movie with Phillip Seymour Hoffman would be fun to watch. I was half-right. Hoffman is a treat. This film is not.Tom tom tom. What kind of talentless egotrip is this film? Yes, we get to watch you run around like a gazelle hopped up on amphetamines (I just know that the footage was sped up). Yes, you shoot things and blow things up. But I thought you would've learned from what made for passable viewing in War of the Worlds. We need to see that your character is HUMAN. There's no suspense when a man can rail shoot three guys like it's no problem, run four miles without breaking much of a sweat, and all the other $hit in this film, unless I actually care about the characters. Tom-bot is bloody indestructible. They try, oh do they try to give Tom a human side, but there isn't any emotional depth to be found, and you'll find yourself thinking about other things when he hangs out with his wife and thinks about a now-dead former student.Didn't care about Tom. Didn't care about Rhames, who really just nags and whines about relationships. Yuck. It's nigh insufferable. Rhys-Meyers is here as the other closeted gay actor, and he too, runs around a lot. Fishburne looks like a fat sack of crap. Post-Matrix depression? Maggie Q blows up a beautiful car. What is with the destruction of beautiful machines in action films these days? Do they think that middle to lower class audiences like to see things they'll never own get destroyed? Simon Pegg is in this for too little time. He's a joy and the screen lights up with his presence.No one is taking this seriously except Hoffman. And while that's not entirely a bad thing, No one is taking this seriously enough to have fun. Hoffman has fun, as did I watching him (The opening scene of the film is by far the best one) but nearly everyone is just going (running, it would seem) through the paces. Stunts that should be amazing seem ho-hum, business as usual. People finish each others clichéd lines.Now, a film has to be supremely awful for me to walk out (I'm not one of those patience-less shmucks that always walk out) but I'm not sure whether I could've stood this movie had it not been for the pause button. Aside from Hoffman, it's entirely forgettable. D+",3,0,1,12 May 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," Excellent and what's more, intelligent suspense movie.
","Lucky Number Slevin  A case of mistaken identity lands Slevin (Josh Hartnett) into the middle of a war being plotted by two of the city's most rival crime bosses: The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and The Boss (Morgan Freeman). Slevin is under constant surveillance by relentless Detective Brikowski (Stanley Tucci) as well as the infamous assassin Goodkat (Bruce Willis) and finds himself having to hatch his own ingenious plot to get them before they get him.Wow! This is quite the clever movie. One of the things that attracted me was the dialogue. It is quirky, brainy and quick-witted. Josh Hartnett, who I enjoyed in the widely ignored Hollywood Homicide, delightfully displays this verbal black belt in karate that sadly does not extend to his physical fighting skills. He gets the crap beaten out of him quite frequently. He keeps the movie going with charm and our sympathy for his being in such a crappy situation. Anymore about him would be spoilers, but suffice to say it's very entertaining. Lucy Liu plays his love interest. Her scenes with him are about 10 times as entertaining as the entirety of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Though that doesn't say much at all, I grew to care about their relationship.Another thing I was quite grateful for was the presence of Morgan Freeman. His sultry voice is, for once, not acting as narrator or warm support to the lead. He plays one of the villains, and does so with silky menace. I was also glad to see Ben Kingsley in something of quality for a change. After Thunderbirds, Species and (ugh) BloodRayne, I thought he'd finally given up on doing anything worthy of his skills. He didn't have anything too too challenging to do, but I enjoyed his little monologue near the end. Bruce Willis is. Bruce Willis. If you like the persona he brings in his films (I enjoyed his young cop a little more than his old cop) this is it with a heavy mystique added. To be fair, he was a wild card and was completely unpredictable.Of course, completely unpredictable could be the name of this movie. Without revealing anything I can tell you that almost everything said and done comes out of left field. The story is so good and the exposition is skillfully prepared, (by director Paul McGuigan) so the lags are minimal and any confusion felt is momentary. If you like your suspense..suspenseful, than this is for you. My only real critique is that I can't imagine anyone would want to see the movie more than once. Also, if you're looking for any depth or greater meaning, aside form its layers, there is none. But it's an entertaining and what's more, intelligent movie. And that deserves notice.Lucky Number Slevin gets an B+",8,5,16,7 April 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Another great performance from Bale, and Crowe's most interesting character yet.
","3:10 to Yuma - James Mangold's remake of a Western I haven't seen starring Russell Crowe as Ben Wade and Christian Bale as Dan Evans. Ben Wade (Crowe) is an outlaw seemingly too smart to be an outlaw who, in the celebration of his latest robbery, was apprehended. Dan Evans (Bale) agrees to hold the captured outlaw who's awaiting a train to go to court in Yuma. A battle of wills ensues as the Dan and Ben travel closer to Ben's punishment.Let me just say firstoff, that the performances are captivating. Christian Bale, who I've never known to give a bad performance, brings quiet intensity and a desperateness to his part. He wants his family to have a future, and for his son to be proud of him. Russell Crowe gives possibly my favorite performance of his, as he chews the scenery, kills people (not much new there), and barely lets you know what is going on in his character's mind. His intentions are never clear, and just as muddled is his take on morality. The Western genre has been famous for muddled character desires, though money and the killing of others is usually among them. Ben Wade is famous, has all the money he could desire, and has killed 'more people than the Drought', so the ambiguity of the character and his chemistry with Dan Evans (whose fate he showed more interest in than his own) made for great viewing.Alan Tudyk (one of my favorite 'that guy' guys), Peter Fonda and Luke Wilson play small parts. The action is intense, but doesn't overpower the character driven screenplay, as two of this generations' best actors go toe-to-toe. Not everyone will appreciate this film perhaps, but I found it to be very good and quite moving (esp. at the end). The film's is a little over 2 hours, but very well paced. I'd see it again in a heartbeat.I give it an A.",10,2,5,8 September 2007
In Bruges," How will this affect tourism In Bruges? People might actually know of its existence!
","In Bruges - Two hit-man named Ken and Ray (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Ferrell respectively) are ordered by boss Harry (the always excellent Ralph Fiennes) to go to Bruges, a quaint little nothing town in Belgium. Ken enjoys the sights, but Ray doesn't. Soon Ken gets orders to kill Ray for botching a job.This is a gem of a movie. Both hilarious and suspenseful, it has the comedy that can only come from European sensibilities (good writing and careful story arcing, that sort of thing). The directing and editing are also of notice. The film also has the good sense to keep things down to earth, which actually makes it all the funnier. Colin Ferrell is twitchy, irritable, and has no control over his tongue, while Brendan Gleeson's character is a sober, dignified calm soul. Ralph Fiennes plays a foul-mouthed, straight-forward assassin with a code of honor. He needs to do more films like this. He more or less steals every scene he's in without even trying.On a sidenote, I wonder how this will affect tourism in Bruges, despite Ray's constant put-downs of the city (and one horrid joke about Belgium, but never mind that). Probably in the positive, for all press is good press. The city, for it's medieval quaintness, practically is a character in the film. The movie will probably raise people's awareness of the city in any case. It's an impeccably plotted story-arc with dramatic moments almost as powerful as the laugh out loud moments (and Lord, were there many).Hilarious and overall enjoyable, In Bruges gets an A-",9,3,8,14 March 2008
Kung Fu Panda," That was Delightful!
","Kung Fu Panda - Po the Panda (Jack Black) must somehow become a Kung Fu Master in order to save the Valley of Peace from a villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung. Set in the legendary world of ancient China, it features the voice talents of Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and Jackie Chan (kind of).At first glance the movie looked like a pass, mostly because of a crap title and Jack Black's less than good batting average lately. The kung fu genre has also kind of been mocked and done to death. This is the day of CGI and the superheroes.But this movie, on the whole, is delightful. It is funny and cool, and not in a topical way. It also stays away from the usual fart and pee jokes that movie execs push in when they can't admit they don't know what kids like these days. No. This movie is actually honest to goodness funny. It's also got some very good action sequences, and doesn't do the same tired montages we've seen before. Po learning shaolin in a couple days seems to go down a lot smoother than Daniel-san winning a karate contest after a week of manual labor, because of the excellent decision to do this in cartoon format, and because of Po himself. There hasn't been quite this good a protagonist in an animated film in awhile. Po is a goodnatured but cowardly and overweight nerd, just like most martial arts nerds. He's the sort of guy who worships the martial arts, like me and my friends used to (hell, still do), but never had the time or discipline to learn (1 year of Aikido and 3 months of Tae Kwon Do for me. Nothing stuck). Speaking of martial arts, the movie doesn't shy away from the action either. There's about as much awesomeness as a PG cartoon can get away with. The animators did an excellent job. Of course this movie treads on familiar ground ('believing in yourself' etc etc). It's a labor of love towards the martial arts and an attempt to keep their spirit alive.Jack Black plays it just right without going overboard like he's prone to do, and the result is one of my favorite characters in their extensive movie list. Dustin Hoffman plays sound support as the Red Panda Master. Seh Rogen is hilarious and Ian McShane always plays a good villain as the Evil Leopard Tai Lung. It was a pleasant surprise to hear Michael Clarke Duncan and David Cross as well.I'll probably purchase the DVD for this one. A truly pleasant surprise from a movie I expected little from about a panda nobody expected anything from, Kung Fu Panda gets an A-.(now don't get greedy an make a sequel now. I had to endure trailers for Madagascar 2 and Pink Panther 2 to get to this)",9,3,5,21 June 2008
Star Trek," Nearly perfect mix of action and story.
","Star Trek - In lieu of successful reboots of James Bond and Batman, we have one of Star Trek. A young James Kirk (played with swagger and heart by Chris Pine) joins Starfleet to join Romulans from an alternate future in battle. He is not alone, with young Spock (played to perfection by Zachary Quinto) and a excellent supporting cast including Simon Pegg, Karl Urban (actually playing a funny character. nice)and John Cho. There are a few other surprising cameos from various TV shows, and a friend from the original show.I will start by saying that I was never a big watcher of the original series. William Shatner and the low budget scared me away from it, but I found Next Generation to be a pleasing show. This film is a good combination of story, action, humor, and most importantly, characters. It's very much an ensemble piece, and rightly so. The original Star Trek was not meant to be solely about Kirk. Zachary Quinto comes close to stealing the show a few times. Spock is of two worlds and conflicted about whether to follow in his human or Vulcan roots. He and Kirk meet at Starfleet Academy, and they are not friends. Their relationship is one of the more interesting parts of the film.As dodgy as the premise of time travel has become what with being abused by several sci-fi series such as the 'Terminator' franchise and 'Heroes', it's surprisingly well maintained here with few perceivable plot holes. Surprisingly this is one reboot that doesn't want us to forget the original. The script is also funny and allows for good characterization. The film is a nearly perfect mix of story and action.There is only one kink. Eric Bana plays a rather mediocre villain Nero in comparison. He is underwritten to be fair, what with an Enterprise cast to become familiar with and all. Still a little more care should have been considered with character that commits acts to the level that Nero does.Of note is the fact that the writers of the smart screenplay, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, were also responsible for the incredibly dumb Transformers screenplay. Clearly they a) have a lot more respect for Star Trek or b) were pandering to the masses with Transformers and did not feel that movie needed a clever script. What's important is that this one does. It's not so much a disguised morality tale with allusions to a present day concern like many of the television episodes were. Star Trek is firmly in the family of space opera. And why not? This fits the form of a 2 hour film much better than a 45 minute episode. And I would venture this is a Trek that everyone can find something to enjoy.The action is enjoyable. Kirk is a brawler with more brawn than ability. You could play a drinking game for every time he gets the crap knocked out of him. Spock's fighting style is suitably stiff and alien. The space combat too has weight. And thank goodness there is no noise in space. The Enterprise does make a very satisfying noise when being shot into hyperspace though.Another thought was given considering the remake. Historically, for every period of innovation, there are typically several decades that pay homage to that time period. The 2000s will probably be known for this. In this decade we have remade good films into bad ones like, god take your pick. We have rekindled love for tired and stale franchises, like Star Trek and James Bond. Enjoy their quality of course, but will we find our own voice and stop making love letters to the past? Star Trek gets an A-",9,1,12,22 May 2009
Iron Man 2," A blast! well, several....
","Iron Man 2: Taking place immediately after Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) reveals himself as Iron Man, enigmatic rival Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has some sort of grudge against the Stark family and builds his own unique suit of power armor. Flash forward, and Tony Stark finds not all is roses with his new life. His armor's power source is slowly killing him, and government suits and military forces are demanding the power armor be handed over. I find it funny that when Iron Man first hit the scene in 2008, some people scathingly pointed out the similarities between Iron Man and Batman. Now that enough clear differences have been made between the characters and the original walks on water in many people's eyes, the sequel has been dismantled and hardly given unanimous praise. If you're wondering why I first mentioned Batman, it's because I find many of the complaints critics have made about Iron Man 2 to be the very things they loved about The Dark Knight. Too many supporting characters, too many plots juggling in the air, too dark, the villain isn't shown as much, and the film seems like a set-up for a sequel. Suffice to say that, damn the critics, I had a great time. There is a perceptible change in tone and scale between the first and second movies, but on the whole, I think people want to see the universe a character occupies expand between movies. That child-like glee you felt at Iron Man flying for the first time? Yeah. Look we can't have a second film that just involves Tony tinkering in his workshop again. Sequels are supposed to offer challenges and complexity. Robert is great. He brings believability and gravitas to a larger than life character. He shines particularly in some unexpected scenes such as one where he is trying to win Pepper's favor back (unsuccessfully). Tony really likes his redheads, as he's now juggling Pepper Pots and Natasha (the vivacious Scarlett Johanson). Gweneth Paltrow is sharper as Pepper this time around and seems more comfortable bantering with Tony a la Robert Altman. Am I the only one who notices that her character seems to spend a LOT of time watching shows where talking heads bash the Stark company? Kinda lends a perspective to her typically on-edge persona. Don Cheadle gives more presence to the role of Rhodey than Terrence Howard, and by the end is swingin' one liners with the best of them. It's nice to see the director Jon Favreau on screen more this time as Happy Hogan the driver. Sam Rockwell is over the top and a treat in Stark-less scenes as part-time rival and full-time jackass Justin Hammer. Mickey Rourke disappears into the role of Ivan Vanko, and sans the Batman sequel, there isn't enough of him. He definitely makes his mark in the first third and the conclusion of the film. Iron Man has never been known to have the best villains, but the same could be said for most of the Marvel Universe (About half to two thirds are generic thugs with super-strength) as far as a realistic movie villain goes. I think Jon Favreau did well combining a few choice elements from a few villains and getting a great character actor like Rourke to play Whiplash. I'm extremely interested how he'll pull off the questionably named Mandarin. The story holds interest through what some people might consider quieter moments. Despite many things given away in the trailers the film still has some surprises. There are thrills and laughs a plenty. Some of the action is frankly quite awesome. The film does not close quite as quickly as the first one did, but it still feels wrapped up too soon. There are some cool scenes hinting at the much anticipated Thor and Avengers films, I for one, can't wait. You can't go home again, but you can grow up. Iron Man 2 gets an A-",8,2,4,7 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Funny and sweet without seeming too formulaic
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall - A slacker composer Peter (Jason Segel from 'Knocked Up') has a breakdown after his girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell of 'Heroes'), the star of a hit TV show, dumps him for a British pop star. Peter goes to Hawaii to try and forget about Sarah, which proves to be a poor choice when he finds Sarah is not only in Hawaii, but they are staying at the same hotel. Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill and Mila Kunis co-star.This was a funny movie! It's a more mature than your average comedy. It survives comedically without leeching off too many other bits of pop culture, unlike Knocked Up. There is the exception of some funny spoofs of CSI and Ghost Whisperer, two fatted calfs rip for killing. Everyone is allowed to be funny, even the women, and they are. I enjoyed the occasional 'Scrubs' style cut-aways which were frequently funny. The best one has to be the week Peter spent in the same pair of sweat pants.This was a lucky stroke from from first time director Nicholas Stoller and first time writer (in addition to lead actor) Jason Segel. I hate making comparisons to other actors, but I kept thinking of Judge Reinhold when I saw Segel. Not that that's a strike against him.Segel is a fresh face in the comedy genre, and is adept at playing sympathetic slacker and funny man in one. Kirsten Bell acts much better in this than Heroes, and it's a nice change of pace to not recognize Paul Rudd in appearance and character immediately. Bill Hader is funny as always. What really comes across in this film is that everyone, even Sarah Marshall, seems like a 3-dimensional character. Hopefully the days in comedies when people are bitchy or vile just for the hell of it are gone. Even the shallow pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), who is the rival to Peter, is likable. There's no animosity between the two men. It's nice to have a comedy where we don't have to demonize anyone.It's a cute film, sometimes hilarious, but the first half is definitely funnier than the second half. I might pick it up on DVD sometime.B+",8,64,91,13 November 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Pretty good, minus the Passion of the Lion.
","The Chronicles of Narnia - Based on the classic novel by CS Lewis. Four London children are sent to a professor (Jim Broadbent)s country home in order for protection during World War II. There they find a magic wardrobe which leads to a mystical land called Narnia, which is being ruled by an evil witch (Tilda Swinton). To defeat the Witch, they must join forces with Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), the lion God of Narnia, and the great battle between good and evil.Good things first. The film is well directed for the most part, though it could've been made more touching. It, in the wake of numerous Harry Potter films, Lord of the Rings, and a slew of mediocre epic wanna-bes, manages to keep the ideas of magic and grand scale battles interesting. The music and locales offer a different sort of character and charm from other movies. Swinton is drippingly evil as the Witch. Though she looks like Galadrial without eyebrows and dilated pupils, her character is radically different and deserves appreciation. The children are all earnest and cute and British, though they all have some points where I just wanted to reach into the screen and slap one or two of them. There are some adorable critters in the mix of everything. I loved the adorable little Beavers (voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French, one of my beloved British actresses) and the Fox (voiced by the charming Rupert Everett). Liam Neeson voices Aslan (Why is he always typecast as mentor figures?) with earnestly and authority. The final battle is pleasing to the eyes and the adrenaline of all, and manages to be satisfying in spite of it's PG rating. (On a minor note, why are all these experienced warriors so willing to be commanded by a couple of teen boys? Silly.) Now on to the mediocre stuff. I found myself grimacing at the absurdity and spectacle of the sacrificing of Aslan. Really, what the hell is this? The Passion of the Lion? Disney already killed a Lion in one of their films, and they did it better that way. I haven't read the books, but I don't care if it IS in the book. The scene is just silly. I get the allegory. On the third hour the mice nibbled at the Lion's ropes, and he became alive again. Dumb. Another thing that concerns me, for a film that takes place during World War II and strives to show us the importance of sacrifice, Narnia is pretty lenient on letting ANYONE die unless they're bad. Good people don't die. And that's where the boys are separated from the men, and Lord of the Rings is placed a notch (well. several notches) above Narnia. War involves sacrifice. It involves pain, and Narnia glides over that like it's the glacier lake. Oh, and having a scene that shows Santa giving a 6 year old girl a dagger is just plain wrong. Excellent to take a child to, and alright for everyone else, Narnia gets a B.",6,0,1,11 December 2005
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Has 'rushed' written on it's forehead.
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine - We see Logan (Hugh Jackman)'s past, or a summary of it in the opening credits, and then flash forward to...either the 70's or 80's. I'm not sure. It's not very clear. In any case, the film follows Wolverine and Sabretooth and *sigh* another too long list of mutants through various shenanigans. There are some decent fights and a few funny and/or awesome moments, but it's unsatisfying overall.I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong with what should have been better than X-men3 and probably X2 as well. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber do their best and bring their A-game. Ryan Reynolds should have had far more to do in this film as he was great. Unfortunately writers Skip Woods (Hitman. ugh) and David Benioff cannot claim the same. The story is rushed and there are multiple points one just cannot get their head around. Why is Sabretooth doing the things he does? What is Stryker's ultimate goal and why does he get an entire sect of the American military to go along with essentially stupid ideas, in Canada no less? Why does it take a plane trip to get to a place we later see has bridge access to it? What is apparent from these X-Men films is that two hours cannot support the number of characters they cram in. The fact that this was a Wolverine movie should have cued the writers into the notion that we want more Wolverine. It did not. The script is not awful, but offers little room for Wolverine to actually brood or have character moments or do anything but go from point A to point B. No one is really allowed to do much but confer plot, which is bad, because the writers gave little thought to the plot or the character treatments. Deadpool is more or less tarnished and Gambit's part is pretty insignificant.What we have here is an unfinished feeling film due to a poor story. Admittedly, the X-Men comics were never as much about story as they were about cool looking characters dealing with isolation and whining about their pathetic lives inspite of their awesome powers. Nevertheless, Jackman and Schreiber deserved a better movie to be built around them. It's not bad, but I'll always wonder how much better a film this would have been if David Hayter has scripted it.

Hot Fuzz," Loved Shaun and I love this one too!
","Hot Fuzz - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's second film collaboration in which super-cop Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is reassigned (on account of making everyone else on the force look bad by comparison) to a sleepy town where the crime rate is near zero. Yet a hint of intrigue is in the air, in the guise of ex-007 Timothy Dalton (I give away nothing. The movie glaringly implies his malevolence half a dozen times.) who is finally given something of merit to do film-wise. Angel meets bumbling sidekick Danny Butterman (Nick Forst, lovable as ever), his new partner. Frost and Pegg have such wonderful chemistry and it doesn't really matter that Frost is really just rehashing his character from Shaun. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. There are numerous cameos that only the British or BBC America fans will notice, but you might recognize Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan and Steven Merchant.This movie is off the f*cking chain! It lampoons quite possibly the easiest to parody of movie genres (perhps second to slashers), yet makes you remember the films with fondness. Where other parody films would just put down the film or, more likely, mimic a scene from the film with some fart joke or cartoon violence (Date/Epic/Scary Movie hacks, I'm thinking of you). The film has numerous take-offs like a stupid strongman with near invulnerability, a la James Bond of course, and also makes reference to films like Point Break, Bad Boys and many others.Like Shaun of the Dead, A movie I love, this movie actually transcends comedy and willfully becomes a part of the genre it spoofs. I actually kinda want to go and watch Point Break now. Also like Shaun, it has incredible wit and numerous jokes that come to be prophetic and revealing about the plot. It's quite likely you'll miss a few jokes (sometimes because you laughed too hard at some part the first time, sometimes they're too subtle), making replay value of the film a bonus. The talks about one-liners are hysterical. There's also enough gun-play and explosions to satisfy any action movie junkie. And the movie has a heart to go with the laughs, due to the film's oh-so likable lead duo.A wonderful comedy/action film. I know I'll buy it on DVD and watch it many times over. A's all the way. Now when'd the next one coming out?",10,1,2,23 April 2007
Terminator Salvation," Fun with strong performances from Bale and Worthington.
","Terminator Salvation - The year is 2018. The machines rule, and the humans are on the losing side. John Conner (Christian Bale) battles on, but he needs the help of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a half-human half machine experiment of Skynet to save Kyle Reese.McG seems to have a chip on his shoulder that stems no doubt from his nickname. He and this film are twin souls - each trying to prove their existence in the world of cinema. T3 left the world bombed to hell and added a few carelessly thought out plot elements that hurt the attitude of the series in general (nuclear cores? robots pre-designed to not kill?), but the underlying problem with the series has always been the characters struggling to undo the future that has already had it's shape on the past. Now we have characters trying to secure the past that has already happened. Confusing? Kind of. Does it need to be here? Questionable. Is it fun? Quite often actually.Christian Bale adds weight and seriousness to the film. He's still not freakin' leader of the resistance, but we see elements of why this will be so. Sam Worthington is very watchable as Marcus Cole. His battle for humanity is (literally) the film's beating heart. If nothing else from this movie stays with you afterwards (and hopefully more than a few elements will, as it's a decently put together film) his performance should. Bale and Worthington's scenes together are some of the best in the film, and it's a pity there aren't more.There are lots of cool robots. Robots that swim, drive motorcycles, shoot the series' iconic miniguns, and giant ones with cannons and grabbers. All of these make for good bangs and summer entertainment. The lack of laser weapons and fields of skulls ripe for crunching might disappoint series diehards, but overall the action is quite good. The T-800 has never been so formidable.Terminator Salvation, like John Conner for mankind, was hoped to be the tentpole for future movies. It's hard to see happen, unless Direct to DVD is your thing. This was a good film, but it's hard to see them taking the series any further.Terminator Salvation gets a B-",6,3,5,21 May 2009
Juno," Short and very sweet
","Juno - Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) becomes pregnant by her best friend Paulee Bleeker (Michael Cera) and considers letting couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) adopt the child.Firstoff, this movie's marketing felt like a clever ploy. A limited release almost a month ago? Then a bombardment of trailers giving away about 40% of the movie's best jokes. It was almost in danger of being like that Hercules cartoon for me.That said, the movie nearly lives up to it's hype. The acting is great, with a very good performance from Ellen Page. She plays the whip smart-except-for-being-a-pregnant-teen Juno. Page handles what could have been a slightly irritating character in the hands of a lesser actress. I enjoyed her commentary about high school and would have liked more. She is incredibly quirky, as is the rest of the cast. To the point where some characters sounded semi-alike at times. We must have stumbled into Napolean Dynamite land a few times. Aside from Jennifer Garner, who largely plays straight-man, there isn't a non-quirky character in the cast. This is all well and good, but occasionally it felt a little surreal. Michael Cera plays the same character he did in Arrested Development and Superbad, but like with Christopher Walken, it's such a great awkwardly funny character that nit-picking seems stupid.The movie succeeds at both the comedic (and lord are some bits funny) and dramatic bits, but possibly my favorite scene-stealing bit would have to go to Alison Janney as Juno's step-mom for the great ultrasound scene. I also loved JK Simmons as her dad. The shop owner at the beginning of the movie has possibly the greatest bit-part ever.The movie is short and very sweet. The cutest movie I've seen since Little Miss Sunshine (though I liked that one more), Juno gets an A-",9,7,15,25 December 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At Patience End
","Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End - Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightly) and a host of too many other people go and rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from a sort of purgatory because they need him to help overturn the East India Trading Company and defeat Davey Jones. It's a plot that shouldn't be too too complicated, but boy it endeavors to make your head spin. I loved the first two Pirates films and pretty much knew the characters and plot lines, but I still couldn't fathom some character's motivations or why some things were happening. It felt at times like the directors were putting the movie together by way of a jigsaw puzzle.I found no fault in the acting. Depp was great as usual, but being that these films are more or less him, it is questionable as to why he's given so little to do. Geoffrey Rush is great though tame this time. Knightly is fine, though I don't know who thought it was a good idea to rip off Braveheart. Bloom, funny enough, gives his best performance in any of the trilogy. Bill Nighy turns in a better performance than last time as Davy Jones.There's no fault in the acting or special effects, though there's little notable action and nothing that approaches the brilliance of the three way swordfight in #2. This movie hinted at a sort of mad brilliance on ocassion, but like Spider-man 3, just seemed to be too high on it's own popularity. The script by far carries the brunt of the fault here. There were far too many ridiculous plot-holes and vague explanations. Also like SM3 there were too many unnecessary plot lines. Why the hell was Tia Dalma given so much (and yet so little) to do? Her plot-line was pointless. Why was Chow Yun Fat in this movie if he had nothing to do? How did the main cast get to Singapore if they didn't have a crew or a ship? The film is too long and overdrawn. You could have cut about an hour from this film and it probably would've been better. There's fun to be had, but the lasting feeling is irritation.This was one of those movies that I really wanted to like and for the critics to be wrong about. But they're right. The movie is mediocre, and that's a shame. I hope one of the 'Third' movies this summer will break the curse, one even more horrible than that caused by cursed Aztec gold. My favorite films are being tarnished by these lackluster sequels. Screw the horror re-makes. In 10-15 years time, I know what we'll be remaking.This gets a C",5,0,3,29 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Fun movie, though WAY too much camp and Sandman.
","Spider-Man 3 - After having his life virtually suck every which way in #2, Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey Maguire)is the hero of New York in #3. He's beloved by the public, open about himself with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and Peter gets a bad-ass black symbiote suit. What could go wrong? Three things (well more like two, but more on that later). His Uncle Ben's killer is not the man we saw in the first movie but actually Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church in a plot change I do NOT like) a low-level thug who obtains sand-powers and super strength. Peter's former best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), aka Goblin Jr., knows Peter's alter ego and is hellbent on revenge. And lastly Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), Peter's photographer-rival and antithesis gets the symbiote suit to become.....VENOM. Oh, and Peter's relationship with Mary Jane breaks down, again.If that sounded like a mouthful of a plot, trust me, it's not when you see it on screen. It's pretty easy to follow if you've seen the other movies. And as for the scoffing at the mysterious and convenient plot device of the symbiote suit, no one complained at Peter inexplicably losing his spider powers in #2.I've read several reviews of this film, good and bad, and braced myself for the worst (and hoped it wasn't true). This is a decent movie. It's not anywhere up to the level of the 2nd movie, which was less of an action movie and more of a focus on Peter (seriously, no one else in that film got even a quarter of the screen-time he did) getting sucker-punched every which way. All the adults liked it, and I grew to love it.This time, there's action all around, with at least five very fun action sequences that show us just exactly what that ungodly sum of money they spent on this film went into. The aforementioned symbiote suit augments Peter's strength and agility and turns Peter into an Emo beatnik jerk that watched 50's gangster musicals way too many times, and it's absolutely hilarious.The whole 'bad-Peter' worked for me (it may not for other people) because I've known all along that Peter's a nerdy boyscout, and a nerdy boyscout going bad is just going to think of archetypes of badness. James Dean anyone? With all the old Marvel groups getting a revamp into now-time approximately, it IS disorienting to see Spidey still into the 50s and 60s. Maguire's at the top of his game here, and I liked his performance a lot.However at times this movie seemed too funny for a Spidey movie. J.K. Simmons and Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell were all hysterical but the film accessed the cheese and camp factor a little too much, suggesting that Raimi looked to his own roots for this picture, which can be a bad thing depending on your feelings for the Evil Dead series. Topher Grace and James Franco were a treat for me, they were having fun and loving every minute of their screen-time as rightful bad-asses. After two films Franco is finally given something to do, and he was wonderful. Grace is funny and quirky, and his turn as Venom should not disappoint to all but the stingiest of fans.Thomas Haden Church as Sandman turned out to be the crutch of the whole movie for me. It wasn't his fault. He's a good actor. The writing in of him being the *accidental* killer of Uncle Ben, as well as giving Sandman an 'ill' daughter to make us feel sympathy for him, stung of cheap manipulation. Why not give him AIDs and an animal shelter to run as well? The effects used to show his powers were wondrous. Why bog it down with melodrama? The whole 'give the villains some pity' was Sam Raimi trying to replicate the 'good doctor' thing with Doctor Octopus from Spiderman 2. Raimi doesn't realize that villains don't always need a long sympathetic back-story. Some people are just @ssholes. This film needed less of Sandman and waaaaay more of Venom. HE was terrifying and his situation understandable. If Raimi had done more with him the film would've been better.It's still a good film, though from all the backlash I hear, you'll probably love or hate this movie depending on your tastes. I give no definites on liking this one or not. If you liked Spider-man 2 but not 1 you'll probably dislike this movie. In any cases you'll probably have a few gripes as I do, cause it's not a perfect film. It has a good conclusion and does the first two justice for the most part. I know I'll probably see it again.I give it a B-",6,0,1,4 May 2007
Milk," What a lovely moving film.
","Milk - Milk chronicles the last eight years of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn)'s life as he fights for gay rights in the 1970s. It's hard to evaluate films in a vortex. It's especially hard when so much concerning gay rights affects people every day. In the 1970s there was a nationwide movement to ban openly gay citizens from numerous positions including teaching. They were (and still are) put in the same camp as sexual deviants, pedophiles and those who partake in bestiality.Brokeback Mountain was the favorite film of everyone for its topic of gay characters. However it was also an imperfect somewhat boring film largely bereft of entertainment value aside from a great performance from the late great Heath Ledger. Aside from what its viewers attached to it, Brokeback was just a love story without any real political stance, though a stepping stone for better future homosexual films.Milk, on the other hand, has (real) gay characters stepping out of the closet, making a stance on their situation as the more conservative side of society steps on their rights to even function as regular members of society. This film is about hope, equality and justice. It's about the first gay man to demand and seize his rights rather than wait petulantly for someone to take pity. What a fascinating and genuinely nice person Harvey Milk was if we judge by Sean Penn's performance. It's almost laughable to think that anyone should be afraid of him. Harvey was such a sweet fellow, but persistent and inventive as heck.Issues aside (and that's hard to do here), Milk is an entertaining well made film that I feel like I could watch over again, something only the masochistic could say of Brokeback Mountain. Gas Van Sant is no stranger to homosexuality in his films, though he gives it sentimentally and sensitivity unlike with My Own Private Idaho. Milk is very moving as well. The end is sure to move you. The imagery too is just wonderful. I enjoyed the aesthetics Van Sant uses in some shots like the scene shot from the reflection of a safety whistle offered as protection. I was reminded of Kinsey once in awhile. The films share the same sort of tone. That film was about being comfortable with ourselves sexually. This one is about being comfortable with what others do. We have to love and respect each other as brothers and sisters without the quibbling over what is 'right'. We just need to agree that what's important is what 'right for you.' Charming, entertaining and moving, Milk gets an A-",9,0,7,25 December 2008
The Prestige," The Prestige:You'll be talking about it long after it's gone.
","The Prestige - Christopher Nolan's latest collaboration with Christian Bale in which magicians in turn-of-the-century London who battle each other for trade secrets. The rivalry is so intense that it turns them into murderers. Hugh Jackman plays level-headed showman Rupert Angier to Bale's unpredictable but brilliant magician Alfred Borden.The performances are very good all around. I caught Scarlett Johanessan's fake British accent slip same as Natalie Portman's (V for Vendetta) once or twice. They must've had the same voice coach. Bale is sinister, seemingly omnipresent and omniscient, and usually the most watchable character on screen, though Hugh Jackman makes for excellent competition as a man getting down and dirty as he gives up all in a bid to be the best magician. Michael Caine is charming and talented support as always. I didn't even recognize David Bowie as Nikola Tesla; he was almost the real Prestige (unveiling of third act in a magic trick) of the film The tricks, while not as fantastic visually as in The Illusionist, are much more realistic and there is more of a desire to see them unveiled. The cinematography and scripting are top-notch, and the film has the wonderful dis-jointed yet well-paced quality that has come to be a trademark of Christopher Nolan. The film has some genuine suspense to it, and I can't tell anymore about the plot than this, but nothing and no -one is what it seems. The entire film is a magic trick, and the denouement is infinitely more satisfying, weighty and horrifying than that of The Illusionist. For a film titled after the shocking climax of a magic trick, this ending does not disappoint. The only question is whether the film is worth more than one watching. It also was a bit long, though I'm damned if I could figure out what to leave from it. Still, it'll undoubtedly be in my top ten of this year, so I'll give The Prestige an A.",9,2,3,22 October 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Funny, Fun and brilliant visuals with little CG.
","HellboyII: The Golden Army - In the sequel to Hellboy, our titular doom-fisted character (Ron Perlman) is up against Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) who, after an age old treaty between humans and...the rest has been made, vows to take back the surface world for his kind.I enjoyed this movie. It's better and more fun than the original. It's always refreshing to see summer movies done with limited CGI (as with Batman Begins and it's so richly anticipated successor), as these puppets and costumes are more organic and interesting than anything a computer could come up with. Stunts are also cooler than CGI, because it's a real human in peril. This is why CGI should never take over completely, because where's the fun if the computers can take over all of the artwork? When the source of creativity is always a machine, there's a problem.Ron Perlman is solid funny and charismatic as Hellboy. Doug Jones's Abe Sapien also has his voice this time around, and a new level of humanity and friendship is there between these two characters. A welcome change of pace is also present with Selma Blair as Liz. She has more fight in her this time, whereas with the first movie Liz was a bit of a wet blanket, and it was obnoxious that such a sad sack could have such power (and she is most certainly the strongest powers-wise). Seth MacFarlene of all people voices a new character, and is a welcome (hilarious) addition. Luke Goss has an interesting and identifiable turn as Prince Nuada (without it feeling forced like with Sandman in Spidey3). Yes he's the villain of the movie, but often it's only by matters of perspective. In his opinion, humans have wasted the planet and I can't argue very well against that. Some issues I could've seen go deeper. Hellboy is working to destroy those similar to himself, when the people he fights to keep safe don't seem to appreciate this. Del Toro skates over this after a scene of introspection.Overall, the movie is excellent visually even if it's not as brilliantly written as Pan's Labyrinth. It's still very entertaining and quite funny. The freaks are running the show this time around, and the results are a big improvement over last time. B+",7,2,6,12 July 2008
Cloverfield," Sweet jeepers this movie was grueling to watch!
","Cloverfield - A bunch of dumb kids have a going away party (One that's drawn out WAY too long) for one of them when some big ol' monster hits New York. That's pretty much all the movie has going for it plot wise. So not only have the writers gone on strike (if most of the dialogue in this film wasn't improvised, I'll eat my hat) but apparently the film crews have too because this is all from the pov of a hand-held camera used by either a Blair Witch fan or a monkey in a washing machine.I liked the trailer for this film because it was all so unexpected. I had hoped they wouldn't do the entirety of this film that way because it would've been nothing short of torture. But they did, and the second half of it was. If they were going to do it all from first person, it would have been better to have say, a news camera operator helm the audience's viewpoint. I was struggling to avoid illness by the end. Are we sure Michael Bay had no involvement in this movie? Boneheaded plots and cameras on steroids are his speciality. Even my friends were looking up at the ceiling or trying other tricks to avoid motion sickness. One scene involves a flashing light that seemed bound to invoke seizures.The film has a few scares up it's sleeve, and for the first time in forever I actually put my arms up to shield me from on screen terror. But the film as a whole, is a turd. The characters are mostly dumb or weak. There are a few cool and scary moments but when when the film's only original card to play is the very thing that also makes it a grueling process to watch, where's the fun? There's no resolution or questions or ideas explored, just a nauseatingly shot Godzilla movie. If you can tolerate it, and that's your thing, go ahead. I did not enjoy it. D",3,18,35,19 January 2008
Silent Hill," A mixed bag, but a damn good scare
","Silent Hill - Rose DeSilva (Radha Mitchell) looks for her daughter Sharon in a malevolent ghost town known as Silent Hill.Being a fan of the beloved game franchise for years, I awaited this movie with bated breath. I come off with mixed feelings about it though they lean more towards the positive. I really feel that Christopher Gans captured the town's essence and the feelings of sheer terror found in the gameplay.Parts of the movie are gross, disturbing, and the film overall is depressing. The monsters are horrifically real and truly inhuman creations. Truly, the movie is in its stride in the middle of the movie when Rose, sometimes accompainied by cop Cybil Bennet (Laurie Holden), is exposed to the various ghoulish creations and environments of the town's rotten core. Never has a film made me feel so terrified and very ill-at-ease. (I heard people laughing at points that seemed to be caused by excess tension that from actual mirth.) Though Johny Cash's 'Ring of Fire' is amusingly used, there is very little to laugh about in the film. The rest of the music is taken directly from the games and is well used to create a depressing atmosphere. Either you like it or you don't.I should say 'nothing intentionally written for you to laugh about' because a few bits of dialogue are kind of clumsy or unnecessary and caused me to grin slightly. I would've expected better of Roger Avary, writer of Pulp Fiction, but he probably gets tired of everyone comparing his stuff to that film.The acting is mostly strong, and when it isn't, it sticks out like a big ol' sore thumb. Mitchell does well as Rose. Always showing concern for her daughter, never screaming too much or overacting. Holden plays good support. Sean Bean is completely wasted on the sidelines as Christopher, Rose's anxious husband desperately looking for her while the real story goes on. Why couldn't they have saved him for the sequel? I could almost see him almost yearning to do have some big part in the story. Instead, as it happened in North Country and Equilibrium, he is thrown away. Alice Krige is suitably creepy as Christabella, and Tanya Allen just sucks as Anna. Why did they include her? She brings down the quality of whatever scene she's in. Thankfully, she gets killed off. Unthankfully, it's one of the most gruesome things in the movie.The second half of the movie doesn't hold up to the first half, and I really dislike that so many people are around the 'ghost town'. In the games, there were at most 6 people total in the town. Here, there's maybe 30. It really brings down the quality.The movie ending (and hell, the entirety of the movie) is likely to be confusing for most and depressing for all if they figure it out. In any case it's a bloody good scare and a must see for horror afficionados. For Silent Hill fans, a mixed bag. I'm still unsure where I stand on Gans interpretation. There was a lot he did I like and some that I really didn't like. I might appreciate it more with repeated viewings.This gets a B/B-",5,0,2,21 April 2006
Crash," Wow. just wow.
","How could this one've slipped past theaters with such minimal exposure? A series of interconnected vignettes involving diverse characters and odd circumstances. I should've known to pick this one up when I saw that Don Cheadle stars. That man is a magical actor. Other important players are Terrence Howard as a successful black Hollywood director who is unsure about whether to stand and fight for his dignity after he and his wife are pulled over and abused by Matt Dillon, while Ryan Phillips a conflicted cop, is disgusted at Dillon's abuse of power. And this is the best movie Brendan Fraser has done since Gods and Monsters, but we don't see as much of him. His wife Sandra Bullock (who I was delighted to not see play herself) is spooked into distrusting and despising all minorities after she and Fraser are car-jacked. There are like 12 or 13 other important characters, and each is given a thoughtful and diverse background.Paul Higgis is a masterful director and writer. The film is engaging, intense and powerful, with central themes of race and socio-economic status (more the former than the latter). I dislike using the terms Hero and Villain because these people are just people. Points of view switch and people grow, as they would in real life. The movie is slightly fanciful but not so much that it looses reality. And the fact that it is so real is what makes you connect with it the most.No question, this is the best movie of the year and gets an A.",10,1,7,30 December 2005
Knocked Up," Time Will Tell if I really love this film, but it's very funny.
","Knocked Up - A fun-loving slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) has a one night stand with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and they decide to keep the baby and strike up a relationship from there.The acting in this is solid, the stand-outs being the two 40 Year Old Virgin veterans Rogen and Paul Rudd, who looked like they had a blast making this film. Katherine Heigl brings them down to earth in a part that in a lesser actress' hands would be annoying. My one real complaint would be that at times the comraderie between the Seth and his buddies felt a little forced, unlike thhe group in Virgin.Judd Apatow is quickly rising through the ranks as one of my favorite comedy directors (Up there under Edgar Wright) and like The 40 Year Old Virgin, this film takes a long-shot premise (In reality, w/e your views on choice or not, this would easily end in an abortion) and runs with it in a more or less serious fashion, though there'd be less hilarity and far fewer movie references in a truly straight-forward version of this tale. If nothing good has come out of Spider-Man 3, at least this film got some good material out of it. And I don't ever recall seeing a better Robert De Nero or Arnold Schwarzennegger impression before. James Franco, Jessica Alba, Alan Tudyk and Steve Carrell (looking as uncomfortable about his Evan Almighty film as I am) all make cameo appearances.Of course, movie references aside (There's one every 5 minutes or so), this movie is hilarious, and while there aren't that many laugh you to tears moments, the general feeling I had was glee. Rarely a minute goes by without something to make you at least smile, if not laugh out loud.Humorous antics (and lo, there are many. From drugs to boffing to Cirque du Soleil, these guys can have fun with anything) aside, this is a coming of age story. These are some real characters that go with the funniness.The main characters are very sympathetic, with the possible exception of Debbie from time to time. I felt she was rather cold sometimes. The movie makes sport several times of marital fights (emotion driven and pointless) and whether or not the women in the audience mind this or not, I don't know. Movie Mom gave this film a B- so I cannot make any claims as to whether the women like this film or not, but this film is one I'd definitely recommend to the guys.Comedies are hard for me to give a final judgment on because the mark of a very good one is how many times you watch it afterward. I gave The 40 Year Old Virgin a B+ originally and it's become one of my all time favorite comedies. For now, I give Knocked Up an B+",8,8,18,1 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tim Burton fans will love it. Fans of the original musical will enjoy it but be disappointed.
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street - Tim Burton's adaptation of the classic Stephen Sondheim musical, a dark comedy with an ending bordering on Greek Tragedy. Tim Burton rounded up the usual suspects (Christopher Lee is absent though) and Johnny Depp is the lead as Sweeney Todd, a simple barber who once had a loving wife and daughter but they were stolen by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, wonderful as always) and Sweeney was shipped away. Years later, Sweeney wants revenge and resolves to cut as many throats as it takes to get to Judge Turpin! I have always enjoyed the stage version of this for it's dark humor and macabre style and Tim Burton was an easy choice to make as director. His noir style where black, white and grey are the primaries and color, when used pops out suit the show very well. Visually the movie is a treat.Now musically the film is slightly controversial. The most controversial choice is the casting of Johnny Depp. He has the character down all well and good. Some fans might object to the fact that he isn't a bass, like Todd was written originally. I'm torn, because I love Depp and he sang well, but I know that whenever a film version of a movie is made, that generally becomes the standard version by which future stage productions are based. Depp, like Jaoquin Phoenix in 'Walk the Line' just doesn't have the lower notes. Depp is a bari-tenor. Still, he has the character down pat and sounds very good.Helena Bonham Carter will never be mistaken for a professional singer, but she does fine. There were probably reams of actresses who could have done better, but again she looks and acts the part of Mrs. Lovett very well. There isn't a bad singer in the bunch. I loved Sacha Baron Cohen's turn as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, and Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener both sounded lovely and Anthony and Johanna. Ed Sanders was adorable as Toby. Timothy Spall (the third cast member from the Harry Potter films) is great and weaselly as Beatle Bamford.Some songs sound a little different from the original scoring. 'Pretty Women' in particular because of the juxtaposition between a bass (Rickman, who sounds quite good) and a tenor (Depp), while in the original it was two basses. I loved 'Worst Pies in London' 'A Little Priest' 'Johanna' 'Epiphany' and 'By the Sea'. I was disappointed, as will be most fans of the original musical, by the sheer volume of songs left out. I and several other patrons stayed during the credits to see if 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd' was finally going to be played. I mean, it's only the catchiest and most iconic of all the songs in the show. All we get is a small instrumental of it at the beginning. Ridiculous. It should have been sung at the end because the film ending feels hollow without it. So much was cut for time. This is a case where a 'Director's Cut' is most necessary. I loved what was there. I just want more.Tim Burton fans will love it. Fans of the original musical will enjoy it but be disappointed by how much was cut to appease mainstream audiences.B+",8,20,39,21 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Would 'High Octane' be a Cliché here?
","The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the CIA's latest program 'Blackbriar' to make super assassins like himself.I was so psyched for this one that I watched it's predecessors yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I recall and Supremacy remains the weak (but still enjoyable) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, aside from a car chase which this film's chase easily tops, slight lacking in action and suspense.Hoo boy, does Ultimatum have suspense! Even when you know Bourne will escape the authorities (and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept), it's still brilliant watching him do it. It's mind-boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those $150 million giant robots did in Transformers.Chalk it up to Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like CIA headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder. He seemed to listen to my various complaints with Supremacy, as the action in Ultimatum is nothing less than awe-inspiring, with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick, a hardcover book (I'll never look at those the same way again) and an electric fan (Don't ask). The music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over.The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles' character 'Nicky' put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency (which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity. This longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in Supremacy, but just works better in Ultimatum (better script). I am reminded of a scene in 'Goldeneye' (the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond film) in which Sean Bean's character asks James if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he's killed. Bourne regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government has transformed men into resources. Albeit, resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons out of anything.Sidenote: it's always bothered me that, despite being a superspy and hunted by the CIA, Interpol, and the police nearly ANYWHERE he goes, that Bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports. Sunglasses maybe? If you have a pulse and love action movies, than Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action film to come out this year. Of course, you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first. It kind of drags a touch near the end, but I almost feel tempted to overlook that. This is the first '3' movie this summer to at least match, if not exceed, the original and that is saying something.A-",9,68,104,3 August 2007
The Aviator," Ther Aviator is good, but needs editing.
","The Aviator - A story about the life of the slightly disturbed aviation pioneer/businessman/film maker Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his battle to own the most powerful and cutting edge airport company in the world. There are many excellent performances in this, and with such a big list of A-listers chances are everyone's got a favorite actor in here. Leo gives the best performance I've ever seen him do as the verminophobic, psychologically scarred perfectionist Hughes, who has a thing for soap, teenage girls, and milk (besides planes and throwing millions of dollars left and right). On a side note, Leo is so lucky; he's gotten to have film sex with so many women, including Kate Winslet and Jennifer Garner, over the course of all his films (I think that's the primary reason he Executive Produces this, so he gets to do that more now that he can't play 17 anymore). Cate Blachett plays Katherine Hepburn with amazing accuracy. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both play believable rivals. John C. Reily, bless him, is a wonderful character actor that should be more appreciated (You've seen him in Chicago). Ian Holm plays Hughes's assistant (a weatherman) with enthusiasm and I enjoyed his sidekick part. Willem Dafoe even has a cameo part.*SPOILER AHEAD*This movie has some thrilling (and, when Leo gets completely thrashed in one colossal plane wreck, chilling) plane scenes and has a very good story to tell. Unfortunately, it doesn't tell it very well at some points. This movie clocks at a very long 2 hours and 46 minutes, but it feels longer than that. Martin Scorsese needs to hire some actual film editors for his nest movie, because it felt like he hired some giggling teenage girls that want to see Leonardo's naked scarred body 10 times in a row.A very good story that would've been better had it been told a little bit faster and edited better. Length tiffs aside, this gets an A- and I'd advise you all to rent it so you can pause during the movie and do other stuff for awhile.",8,0,0,12 February 2005
Watchmen," Not all of it meshes, but very entertaining.
","Watchmen - Zack Snyder's much awaited treatment of the Alan Moore saga has vigilante Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) on the hunt for the person responsible for another superhero's death. In a sweeping epic that spans several decades, we see an alternate world where the U.S.A won Vietnam, Richard Nixon serves as president for three terms, and America has Dr. Manhattan, a man turned demi-god with unfortunately the same amount of vested interest in our human affairs.Goodness, it took an ordeal to bring this to the cinema. I hope those who have waited far longer than me for Watchman are satisfied with the results. More than satisfied in my case. I enjoyed the graphic novel, loved Rorschach and Ozymandias, but didn't acquire quite the same level of adoration as millions of other comic book fans. I can safely say that Zack Snyder and screenwriter David Hayter did a fine job transposing the enormous source material into something fitting for the cinema. Is it perfect? No. But it's as good as anyone could hope for, and I had a really good time.First off, Jackie Earle Haley deserves much props, if not some sort of nomination for bringing this excellent portrayal of Rorschach to the screen. He is an inspired choice, though I will always wonder how Daniel Craig would have done. Patrick Wilson brings the persona of Clark Kent to a very Adam West Batman (costume-wise) version of the second Nite Owl. Billy Crudup's voice is soothing and appropriate as Dr. Manhattan. Matthew Goode was intellectual and intimidating as Ozymandias. I hope to see more from him in the future.I won't nit-pick about what was left out of the film because that's a fairly useless way to go about things on what is a FILM review. I learned my lesson when I was 13 and would not stop nit-picking about what was left out of a Harry Potter film. What is important is that this film contains much of the spirit of the original source. Watchman is still very much so a thinking comic book fan's film. Whether it appeals to audiences outside of that group is up to the box office figures to say.I won't deny there are some cogs that don't mesh. For the love of God, could our make-up and prosthetics teams come as far as CGI has in the last 17 years? Some of the agings are fairly unrealistic. The violence didn't need to be quite this graphic, which is not to say the fights weren't entertaining. They are, but some of the bone crunching would have been more effective had it not been so splattered in our faces. The fights are lovely and visceral, but more befitting of current superhero films than of Moore's original work. Hence my being on the fence about that subject. There's also the heavy hint of Snyder's slo-motion work, which was really over-used on 300 and borders on being so at times here.Not all of Watchmen meshes as a whole, but it's still an entertaining film that I'd gladly see again. A must for fans of comic books, philosophy and history, Watchmen gets a B+",8,2,6,8 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," Mind blowing gaffs in logic
","28 Weeks Later - It's been 28 Weeks (Give or take, I wasn't really paying attention to the numbers at the beginning) since the infected ravaged England, and now England (What'll they call it? New England? That's taken) is being secured by the best peacemakers around, the US Army. As you might have guessed, everything goes well in this resettlement and everyone lives happily ever after.Or not. In this slightly interesting yet unnecessary sequel, Britain is again overcome by a second wave of the infected. How, you ask? Well, a woman with one brown eye and one blue eye also seems to have genes for an immunity to the 'Rage' virus. How can one person in a million (two actually. Her son is also immune) have the genetic makeup to be immune to an artificially created virus, you ask? That's not important right now. However, while she is immune to the effects (dying and coming back to life, the whole killing other people by ripping throats and gouging eyeballs thing) of the Rage virus, she can still transmit it through blood, mucus, saliva, etc. The logic of that just blows my mind. Anywho, she's found by her two dumb kids who have basically doomed mankind with this idiotic act. Why we're supposed to identify with them and wish for their safety is also beyond me.Anywho, her also dumb husband kisses her and then re-kills everyone that managed to survive the first wave of infected. A mark of good horror writing is when you can look at what a character on screen is doing and say 'Yeah, that's exactly what I'd do'. I liked the one army hero dude. He reminded me a little of Nathan Fillion. Wasn't crazy about the rest of the cast. Cillian Murphy wasn't here this time, and boy did I miss him.The US Army is usually shown at the height of their competence in horror movies *cough*. This time around might be my favorite gaff. Though they are there for everyone's security, they are unable to do anything because (Surprise!) the infected look like normal humans. Except for you know, the whole slavering monster thing. The Head Army dude decides to kill everyone indiscriminately, Nazi-style. I guess it's supposed to be some sort of Iraq allusion. In this movie however, it comes across as lazy screen writing. Why would the Army not have foreseen every possible outcome? If the danger was so great, and the Army would be powerless in this situation, why try to re-populate Britain at all? It's been 20 years and Chernobyl is still abandoned.However, for what it is, the mechanics of the movie are quite good. The directing (apparently Danny Boyle did some second-unit filming) is pretty good. The music seems to have been almost lifted entirely from the first movie. The zombie effects are great and the Infected remain a menacing force. The first 20 minutes of the film are quite good and scary. The last 20 are repellent. The film is quite watchable, but for the love of God, no 28 Months Later! Please! Stick with 28 Days Later. a C+",5,0,1,29 December 2007
Knowing," Aside from a few riveting moments, annoyance and boredom permeate.
","Knowing - A page of numbers found in a time capsule from 50 years ago reveals the date and body count for every major disaster (really? on just one double sided page?) from then until up to now. It's up to Ben Gates...I mean Edward Malus...I mean John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) to save the day.Before I get to the review, anyone else tired of one word titles that this year in particular seems to have accumulated? Taken, Push, Knowing, Duplicity, Fighting, Obsessed... It should be fairly insulting that marketing groups think our intellects cannot remember a title that's more than a word long.Nicolas Cage is Nicolas Cage. He's been giving the same performance with different levels of quirk and moroseness thrown in for the last 10 years, so you pretty much know what you're getting in to. He's got another dead relative to grieve over, and is rocking the single parent act again. His kid in this film, well...the less said the better. Okay I'll say it. Are there any good child actors in Hollywood? Is it all just based on who Julia Roberts' kid goes on play dates with? The first 20 minutes or so of the film are a bore, as the film takes the longest time of any in recent memory to roll through the credits. Things pick up occasionally and get very visceral, but by contrast make the low points feel that much lower. The film feels very long with several scenes that should have been cut. When there is action, the camera perks right up and we have some quality camera work, but this only happens two or three times. It felt like waiting for a car crash at a NASCAR race. The script offers few thrills as well. Funny (or is predictable?) that a film about knowing what is to come should offer so few surprises.Another note-worthy problem which this film takes part in: the role and rules of prophecy. Prophecy is in the ranks of time travel in the writer's arsenal; an interchangeable plot device that gets used to the point of abuse. Either prophecies come true and there's nothing we can do about them, in which case there is no reason to watch. Or prophecies can be defied, in which case they were never truly prophecies, which is annoying.This film has the guts to go through with it's prophecy, but it's still unsatisfying. I feel fairly disgusted that the film implies and seems to campaign for several of my least favorite ideologies: Scientology, Creative Design and the end of the Mayan Calender. Overall the film felt like a waste of time. If it felt meaningful or well made to you, you probably haven't thought it through well enough.It didn't have Nic Cage in a bear suit and spin kicking women, but it was enough. D+",4,1,3,4 April 2009
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Decent fare for non-readers. Some fans will be disappointed.
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) goes through his third year at Hogwarts and has to deal with convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison.Ironic that my favorite of the first three books should prove to be my least favorite movie. Whatever magic and energy is powering this film, it's not Rowling or British. Cuaron is a fine director, but was a bad choice for director. He's too breezy with the material and whips through the plot with not enough of the book's charm. Once the kids get to school, everything gets pretty not fun. The Dementors are wonderful creatures and are done to terrifying effect, but are not explained very coherently and some other vital stuff will be lost to people who didn't read the book.There's some fine humor and dark atmosphere, but a lot of the humor is gags and pratfalls. Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Hermione Granger) are sidelined to doing this one routine and are both wasted. In fact a lot of the cast is criminally underused. True, Quidditch has been established as one of the 'gimmicks' in the series, but this movie could've really been livened up had they included the fantastic Quidditch Final,but Cuaron couldn't be bothered. He was too busy doing long tracking shot after long tracking shot back to the Whomping Willow again and again. We REMEMBER, okay? A line of exposition would suffice to make everyone remember about it.The movie seemed like more of a companion guide to the book. Some of the best things in the book were absent and the magic had more of a creepy 'Day of the Dead' quality (talking shrunken heads. Why are they all Jamaican?) The kids are acting better. Gary Oldman was good. The movie in general, was good, but disappointing for me as a fan. It seemed like Cuaron found it a chore to be dealt with. Some fans may not mind. A B.",7,0,0,5 July 2007
Ratatouille," Ratatouille. Adorable little film. A Fine Cut about the latest animated tripe.
","Ratatouille - A young adorable looking rat Remy (Patton Oswalt) has dreams of being a chef in Paris and teams up Cyrano-style with a sheepish no-talent named Linguini (Lou Romano) to cook and restore glory to a formerly 5-star restaurant (booted down to 3. Ouch.) Animated films are getting hard to judge and harder to sit through these days. As the quality of animation gets higher, the pool of ideas gets lower. it seems we have more and more talking penguins, fish, and Shrek rip-offs (Heck, from what I've heard, Shrek3 was a Shrek rip-off). Ratatouille succeeds in bringing something new to the table. Brad Bird directs, so like The Incredibles, this one is more for the adults than the kids (Suprising as it is G rated) but that shouldn't be a bad thing. It's still talking rats and there are many well constructed prat-falls to hold their interest.The movie was not as funny as I had hoped, though it still is genuinely funny at times, but what held me was how much the film sucked me in and had me really caring about the characters. I barely worried about the logistics of a rat being able to read and cook and control Linguini from under his chef's hat. The graphics, when I noticed, were breathtaking. The food and the 'tasting' animation looks wonderful.There is a great voice cast as well. Remy is well animated and I just love that little guy. Patton Oswalt did a great job. Lou Romano managed to convey awkward yet well-meaning in a way that borrowed a little from Jon Heder. He has some great scenes with Janeane Garofolo who plays hard-edged Collete. Peter O' Toole has a wonderful bit as the creepy critic (animation style straight out of Tim Burton) Anton Ego.I was happy that there weren't that many digs at the French. There still are, and I'm a touch disappointed that both the leads speak in completely neutral American accents, but test audiences have to be pleased I'm sure. Ian Holm is nearly undetectable as the villainous super-stereotypical French head chef Skinner.I like that Remy the Rat can't talk to any of the humans including Linguini, something that always bugged me in most of the other animated movies involving animals or people talking in different languages (most irritatingly Pocahontas). It's of little consequence to the review but it's a little personal preference note. Ebert includes those so why can't I? The film meanders a little between the second and third acts but the conclusion is adorable and hilarious. I love the little touches to the animation and the story. This film was clearly a labor of love, not profit, though it'll acquire a lot of both to be sure. An A-",9,3,5,2 July 2007
Tropic Thunder," The Ben Stiller film I was waiting for
","Tropic Thunder - Five actors are sent to shoot a war movie in Laos after their film goes over-budget, with the catch being that there are also some gun-toting drug den dwellers occupying the jungle. The bunch is comprised of a normal actor (Jay Baruchel), a rapper/actor named Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), a comedian (Jack Black) that's an Eddie Murphy/ Mike Myers/ Robin Williams hybrid, action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) who once played a mentally handicapped man to try and get an Oscar, and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) who is the sort of extremist method actor Hollywood loves to dote with Oscars, so for this role he has donned blackface.Dear god this movie is funny! Forget just war movies (Though it rips those up aplenty. It riffs Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, countless dying scenes...) this movie delivers Hollywood's head on a stake. Right from the start the movie also spoofs Disaster movies, sequels, lowbrow comedies, and historical films. Tropic Thunder crosses so many boundaries and insults so many people with such skill and humor that it has to be given the highest praise in return. Several insults are only surface deep though. The Association for the Mentally Handicapped has been up in arms about this movie, but if they were to pay close attention, it's really Hollywood's use of these people that the film is spoofing.Ben Stiller is good. It might have actually been funnier if his part was played by Steven Seagal, but that man could never allow himself to be beaten up in a film, or act. Stiller tones down the parts of previous performances I've hated, and keeps the funny parts. Jack Black delivers so many funny lines pitch perfectly as the least likable of the characters. Brandon T. Jackson and Jay Baruchel (who actually did play a mentally deficient person in Million Dollar Baby) provide strong comedic support. But Robert Downey Jr. runs away with the show in a role that should be completely tasteless, wrong, unfunny, and nonexistent. But oh my god if he does not pull it off and steal the show incidentally. He's wonderful. As Kirk Lazarus he almost never breaks the character's character, even when it's clear that no cameras are around. Every other line from his mouth is a gem, and you know some of the lines from this movie will become tired once they're put on T-shirts and quoted by 13-year olds. The writing overall is top notch. I know a movie must be pure awesome when I am loving the performances of Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey, two actors I really don't like. Funnier with more bite than Borat. A better send-up than Hot Fuzz, Tropic Thunder is the Ben Stiller film I was waiting for and unaware than I was waiting for. It gets an A.",10,7,16,13 August 2008
The Duchess," Good story. Interesting and mostly believable in presentation.
","The Duchess - Set at the end of the eighteenth century, The Duchess is based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish (Kiera Knightley), Duchess of Devonshire. The film delves into Georgiana's passionate and doomed affair with Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister, and the complex love triangle with her husband (Ralph Fiennes) and Georgiana's best friend, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell).Kiera Knightley again does a period piece and again looks mostly out of place. She's British alright, but a few stone away from looking like she belongs in 1770's Britain. It's augmented by the fact that her character, based on a real woman, was supposed to have gone through about 6 pregnancies, 4 of them successful. Knightley's emaciated form is just wrong. What is right though, is her performance. As a mother, as a chasismatic political presence and a woman desperate for a happy life she nails it absolutely.I could have seen a little less focus on the love triangle and a little more on the 'hows' and 'whys' of this woman becoming such an important and popular cultural icon in British society. The film glosses over how this came to be, and asks us to take it as a fact after one brief scene showing the Duchess's political shrewdness. It's another case of Hollywood ignoring what's different about a film, preferring the safety of delivering what people have seen before.Fiennes gives such a quiet performance right from the start but it grows and fills the area. It's often a mesmerizing performance because of his rigid adherence to societies expectations and rules at the cost of all else. Fiennes occupies the screen whenever he's in a scene. When he and the Duchess argue, she's like water smashing up against the unyielding cliff. Ralph Fiennes is aw-inspiringly scary in one scene without seeming in anyway over the top or demonizing of what his character represents. Ultimately his character is human and believable; purely a man of his times. His character is so down to earth and in the end simple. All he wanted from his marriage was a son and to be left alone to play with his dogs.A mesmerizing turn from Fiennes in a likable, if familiar film, The Duchess gets a B+",8,30,39,1 January 2009
Resident Evil," Avoid this.
","Resident Evil - Ugh. When the best thing you can say about a film is it's locations, something is terribly wrong. An underground evil corporation (and that's about ALL that is realistic about RE) named The Unbrella Corporation kills all of it's employees and lets 3 survive along with a Swat team to get mauled by zombies and try and escape. The movie takes an hour (after 2 glorious minutes of actually scary elevator stuff) to do a lot of boring exposition. None of it is terribly well done or intelligently said, as none of the characters are good at acting. And then the zombies show up because of the T-virus, because turning people into mindless killing machines (except they aren't. When off-screen, they ravage an entire city. When on-screen, they can't even walk straight) is SUCH a good strategy. The zombies aren't scary, and you don't care about them, much less the cast. There's Milla Jolovich, who spends half the movie kicking the crap out of zombies, and the other half looking like a stunned cow. There's Michelle Rodriguez, whose most intelligent line is 'Blow me' and is not only and ice queen, but also can't act to save her soul (I honestly couldn't tell the difference between her as a normie and her as a zombie). The only good part is the Licker and a laser field that dices up some people we couldn't care less about (But couldn't it have done Paul S. Anderson, the maker of this tripe instead?). So the acting sucks. The writing sucks. (The most intelligent word used is implore, and it's said by a computer voice by a British school-girl, so that doesn't count) The directing sucks. What's to like here? This is NOT the game that a generation of Playstation owners loved and cherished.D-",2,2,4,31 March 2005
Quantum of Solace," Bond for the art-house action film-goer
","Quantum of Solace - Daniel Craig's second outing as James Bond has him in pursuit of Vesper Lynd's killers from the previous movie. He pursues (and is often pursued by) agents of a shadowy organization. The leader of which is one Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric of 'Munich') a faux environmentalist who is holding a country's water supply at ransom. Judi Dench reprises her role as 'M'. Giancarlo Giannini returns as Mathis and so does Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter.Everyone I have talked to about this movie has one question: Is it better than Casino Royale? No and I'll tell you why. Casino Royale was a fantastic movie that had the novelty of a first-time Daniel Craig and the direction of a seasoned James Bond director (Martin Campbell). This movie does not try to be better and probably could not have been. It tries to be different. The plot, for one thing, actually makes you think.I was happy with the choice of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland) because I knew he and Daniel Craig would help bring depth to the proceedings and help flesh out the character of Bond so that he is not just another man with a gun in an action film. Daniel Craig is as good as he was in Casino Royale, though this time he is 'damaged goods'. He has tremendous force of character, and looks like he could kill you with a glare. He escapes by the skin of his neck, and works harder than any of the other Bonds ever had to. He is the best of the Bonds, because he's a real actor, and a damn fine one at that. Roger Moore was not an actor, even by his own admission. Lazenby was a model. Brosnan was a star. Craig is an actor.Olga Kurylenko gives it a decent run as Camille but she's no Vesper Lynd. And that was the point really, wasn't it? Jeffrey Wright is sly and fun as Felix Leiter. Mathieu Almaric is cruel, weaselly and has an interesting dynamic with Craig.Right off the bat this film provides visceral action, but it does not try to glorify it. The action is gritty and fast and hard, though not quite as fantastic as the chases and fights in Casino Royale. Bond never caps off a death with a wisecrack, like in the original Ian Fleming novels (he rarely quipped at a death). I'm glad they dumped the sometimes stupid humor from the original movies. It was mostly puns and boner jokes. This Bond is coldly efficient, and when he does joke, it's as ironic and dry as the deserts he spends quite a bit of the film in.This film is self aware, a new thing for the Bond films. Prior to Quantum, no one, in or out of the movies, seemed to have a problem with the fact that James Bond's love interests tended to die. It just became like the red shirts in Star Trek, a franchise staple. He lost his wife in OHMSS, mourned for 5 seconds, and was off again. In Quantum of Solace a few people venture that Bond is poisonous through his very nature.The femme fatal used to be more of a way to showcase the latest Hollywood starlet, who came and went before we had the next installment. I think films like The Dark Knight and Quantum are a sign of maturity in our action films, with female characters treated with respect and the understanding that violence has repercussions. Villains want power and money, not global destruction and underwater lairs.That's not to say that this Bond is all work and no play. It is fun, frequently. Marc Forster has fun deciding when to show and not show bits of violence, until the action gets pretty brutal at the final fights. I enjoyed this film stylistically. The film uses a lot of blues and grays and the occasional yellow. Another thing I enjoyed was the location subtitles. By embellishing these, the globe-trotting was not just a 'Bond's gone to Cairo again. yawn.' sort of thing.I was expecting to dislike the fact that this is the shortest Bond yet, after Casino was 'too' long and I felt like I still didn't get enough. It turns out that quality is what matters, not just quantity. This was just the right amount of Bond.It really is a Bond for action lovers and art-house fans alike. I happen to dabble in both camps. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to all. It really gives luster to qualities in the James Bond series that repetition has made stale.A-",9,3,6,14 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Hardly exceeds the hype.
","No Country for Old Men - This was one, like Babel last year, that everyone was raving about but the hype ended up being more than the film was worth. Well that's not totally fair. I LOVED the first half of this movie. Intense, minimalistic, and fantastic acting from Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem (who probably deserves an Oscar nomination at least for playing evil the likes of which I have not seen since the T-1000). Javier plays Anton Chigurh, a hit-man stricken with pure evil.See it for Bardem, but about halfway through do yourself a favor and let the first half of the movie stay in your mind and forget that there's an end to the film (There isn't really. It's become the style to let films just float off like kites rather than give them a definitive or interesting ending, like the other film released a month ago, Before the Devil Knows Your Dead) The riveting first half of No Country involves a cat and mouse game. It is engaging, suspenseful, and a treat to watch.The final third of the movie is cold, detached, and feels rushed, like a few missing reels were taken out of the film. Everyone keeps talking about 'an end', 'how the confrontation is going to end'. Then they pick up right after the 'end'. What the hell? I thought for a second they had skipped a real. I liked the first half of the film, but kept waiting for the amazing reason this film is freaking 15 on IMDb's top 250. I did not see a reason. Fans of the Coen brothers are likely to enjoy this. I haven't seen Fargo so I can't comment. But I do know that the writer's strike must be working on some level if this is the sort of film the critics are looking to now as possibly the Best Film of the Year. I was really looking forward to this one, but the Hype was stronger than the end result. Maybe a second viewing will improve my feelings towards it.B",7,1,5,20 December 2007
Mamma Mia!," Cute, bubbly. Lacking substance.
","Mamma Mia! - Based on the hit Broadway musical, Mamma Mia! Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) invites three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard) her mother slept with 20 years ago to try and find which one is her dad. Why a paternity test or even just a sit down talk to with them and her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) could not have resolved this issue is completely ridiculous *obviously*. Your tolerance of Mamma Mia! is conditional on your liking musicals, acceptance of ABBA, and stamina for cheeriness.First off, Meryl Streep can sing quite well and does 'The Winner Takes it All' quite well. Amanda Seyfried can also sing well. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski can sing but very few of these actresses are given songs that show their voices at their best. Consequently the musical numbers are uneven, if catchy. Some are decent. Some are quite fun in fact, but some fall flat through poor staging. I'm fine with people singing in a film, though it is a little insipid when villagers pipe in here and there with no clue as to what's going on. It's far too cornball.Several actors are given songs where there's no way they should be singing them. I often felt really bad for Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan. Neither has any talent for singing, yet Brosnan given 5 songs. You can see them giving it their best shot and trying to have fun. All the guys here look terribly uncomfortable, not unlike guys pulled into the women's wear at a JCPenney by their girlfriends. It's a hens party through and through.I think America has a real musical phobia going on. We seem repulsed by Broadway, and the only way musicals get to the silver screen is if the music was done by some known band. In Across the Universe it was The Beatles. Now it's ABBA. The double edged sword is that the songs, as was the case in Across the Universe, often have very little to do with the proceedings. In most musicals the music is there to advance the plot and tie in with what is happening. In Mamma Mia!, Characters do not actually get to have discussions, but merely have brief interactions until the next unrelated musical number comes in.When the movie doesn't try so damn hard, it's fun. Alas, everyone runs around too much, laughs too hard, and it sometimes feels forced. I don't even have to have seen the stage show to know it was better. The film is cute and often fun, but it's like a cloud. It's light and wispy and completely lacking in substance. In many respects it's a fine holiday film for when you're stranded in your house with nowhere to go. Just don't go in asking for anything solid. Mama Mia! gets a B-",6,0,1,19 December 2008
Batman Begins," God bless the British. They got Batman right.
","Batman Begins - The beginning chapter of the Caped Crusader(played spot-on by Christian Bale)'s exploits in Gotham City. Chalk it up to the Brits to finally get a Batman movie right. Now don't get me wrong. I liked elements of Batman and Batman Returns, but for all of the beautiful sets and bangs and whistles, Batman was a 2-dimensional supporting character in his own films, and we never saw much of anything that drove him to don the costume and battle evil. Batman needed a beginning, and now he has it. The first hour is spent delving into Batman's past as Bruce Wayne as a child gets the crap scared out of him by bats, and watches his parents get murdered right in front of him (I actually cried here, to my surprise). It's dark, gritty, and emotional. We see Bruce get trained physically and mentally. He learns to harness his fear and use it. Fear as a weapon is a recurring theme in the movie, a key tool of Batman that was somehow left out of the other movies, and the old 60's show. Batman then returns to Gotham and vows to put a stamp on the corruption and evil.Christian Bale IS Batman. He is so subtle but dark and bold, easily the best of the Batmans. Micheal Caine is witty, warm and father like as Alfred. Morgan Freeman makes a nice addition as well as Lucius, the man that gives Bruce most of his equipment. Gary Oldman is excellent as Gordon, the last good-cop in Gotham, a character ignored for some reason in most of the other movies. Katie Holmes isn't exactly a stand-out player in the movie, but she has some moments.Gotham is full of villains, but none of them (thankfully) are allowed more screen-time than Batman. Liam Neeson plays an interesting mentor character as Henri Ducard. He's far more three-dimensional than most mentor characters in this sort of film. Cillian Murphy is undoubtedly my favorite of the villains as Scarecrow. He's scary, disturbing and just plain crazy.Overall, this is the most fun, dark, gritty and most human of the Batmans. It's not all slick and well-oiled. My initial impression of the new Batmobile was 'okay...' but It's grown on me. It sort of like a cross between a tank and monster trucker's wet dream. The chase scene with it on the rooftops was incredible.There are no buildings that look like cathedrals no one would build, like in the more Gothic Batman's 1 and 2. There are no gadgets beyond what someone could create in real life. But it has strong character development, and a good screenplay (and the few one liners spouted here and there are not groan-worthy), and a dark, gritty nature that is so good it just has to be fattening. My one wish would be to see what this new fighting style created for the movie looks like. The shaky camera captured a gritty down and dirty nature, but I would still like to see what the moves look like. But that's a small complaint compared to the rest of the film. this gets an A",10,9,14,16 June 2005
Twilight," Entertaining, albeit completely unintentionally.
","Twilight - Based on the popular children's novels, Twilight is about high schooler Bella (Kristen Stewart), the palest resident of Arizona ever, as she moves to be the palest non-vampire in Washington. She meets smoldering young-looking vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and the two have the most awkward courtship in the history of film. Then he fights some of the most ridiculous and un-scary looking vampires ever to grace the silver screen with their presence.That's really all there is to the plot, and man is it stretched over two hours. Luckily, the film is hilarious, albeit entirely unintentionally. All intentional attempts at humor fall flat. Basically Twilight seizes you with it's big awkward fist immediately, and rarely lets go. The best example (and there are many) is Bella's relationship with her dad, the always uncomfortable looking Billy Burke. There are spaces between their lines that you could drive a truck through. It's all just painfully awkward.Some things kept running through my mind. Edward is supposed to have spent 108 years on this planet. In those 108 years, couldn't he have picked up some basic social skills? Pattinson seems to have watched Charlie Sheen's performance in 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' for research on the undead, because he spends most of the film staring bug-eyed like he's strung out on meth. He gets the American accent all right, and that's the best I can give him. He's supposed to be cool. He's often just antisocial and creepy, especially with lines like 'I enjoy watching you sleep.' This line was hilarious by the way, and there are many that are almost as good. He has absolutely nothing interesting to say, and the makeup people have covered him in glitter for his sunlight scenes, presumably as the final rite of emasculation.I expect so much more from Melissa Rosenberg, a writer on my favorite show Dexter. Stick with TV honey! Teen fantasy does your creepy off-beat writing no favors. I think the script was about 70 pages long, so they filled the rest with awkward silence, during which everyone seems to be struggling for their next line. Sweet jeepers, half the responses the actors give each other aren't even human sounding. What I said for Rosenberg goes for amateurish director Catherine Hardwicke, who should stick with her day job of production designer. She cannot film action or direct actors to save her soul. She has tried to give this the feel of teen angst but has instead come up with an awkward monstrosity that could put the combined talents of Michael Cera and Larry David to shame.Bella is boring and, as mentioned, criminally pale. She's pretty, but I hate her, and her voice is bothersome. It's annoying to have followed a character that does not seem to give a crap about anything, and spends the entire film frowning. She also has the keen observational abilities of a squirrel for not guessing Ed was a vampire, or at least some sort of freakish being, two seconds after he stops a car with his hand. Neither does this freak out or intrigue anyone else in the vicinity, strangely. It's not Ed's weird behavior, aversion to sunlight or mind reading skills but his cold skin that tells Bella he's a vampire, thanks to the magic of Google. Thanks Google! It's so campy, silly and shoddily made that I should hate this film by all standards, but I had a great time. Ironically the less attached to the books the more fun you'll have. I'd give it a D for all fans but the youngest and most devoted. I haven't read the books but I'm sure it has been ripped to shreds on the journey to the film. But I had an wonderful time laughing at the film, minus puncturing points of boredom and a few times where I looked at my watch. One positive note: the soundtrack isn't half bad.Awkward to the end and funny all the way through, Twilight gets a C",5,6,12,12 December 2008
Bolt," Better than I was expecting. Cute, sometimes touching.
","Bolt- The canine star Bolt (John Travolta) of a fictional sci-fi/action show that believes his powers are real embarks on a cross country trek to save his co-star human Penny (Miley Cyrus) from a threat he believes is just as real. Basically it's 'Underdog' meets 'The Truman Show', but there is nothing new under the sun, so no sense beating it up for that. I was expecting a snooze fest only palatable for small children, who will delight in this by the way. I was mistaken. Though the premise is shaky, with obvious plot holes as big as you like (Since when do Dogs act?), it's a sweet little movie, and the kids won't care. The humor is pretty broad but there's something for everyone.John Travolta, an actor I haven't liked in quite some time, gives a genuinely cute performance as a young dog coming to grips with reality. Miley Cyrus also gives a decent performance. It's nice to hear Susie Essman (Here playing the cat Mittens) without the trademark F-bombs dropped in 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. Who is absolutely wonderful, and I doubt I'm alone on this one, is the little couch potato hamster Rhino (Mark Walton, who has made his career with this). He's an obsessive fanboy of Bolt's TV show, and has such aplomb and over-enthusiasm that he steals every scene he's in, and probably the entire movie too. He's probably my favorite 'side character' in years.It's a nice film, with decent laughs and some fun action sequences. Once it sheds the convoluted TV show premise the film is allowed the breathe and have more fun. While it's hardly in the ranks of WALL-E, The Incredibles or Ratatouille, it's still a fun movie.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Great comic book movie minus Berry.
","X-Men: The Last Stand - The third and (possibly) final part to the X-Men series. A mutant 'cure' is found, and then everything goes to hell. Magneto (the always wonderful Ian McKellen) gathers an army to destroy the source: a mutant boy named Leech. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his band of peaceful mutants hope to stop Magneto and blah blah blah. You get the picture. The story's much cooler in execution than on paper.Okay. The great things. Characters lose their powers. Characters die. And goodness knows there are a lot of them. Storm, Beast ,Wolverine (me fav), Collosus, Shadowcat, Iceman, Magneto, Pyro, Cyclops, Juggernaut (who almost steals the show with his one-liners) and best of all: Jean Gray (Famke Jannsen). I haven't even read half the list off, but you get the picture. Needless to say, with so many protagonists, some people's screen time is shunted over, but I don't really give a crap. If you've ever read the original comics, the fightscene pages were twice as spastic and crammed as this movie was.Kelsey Grammar and Hugh Jackman are wonderful as Beast and Wolverine. No wonder the latter's getting his own spin-off (I personally hope he's going to fight the Hulk). She's changed actresses three times over but ShadowCat (Ellen Page) finally gets to kick some ass. Jannsen is F***ing SCARY as Jean Gray/ Phoenix. This plot line in particular is well done.There's no cheesy 'coming out' sequence like in #2. The action sequences were a blast.People were so afraid that Brett Ratner was going to screw up the movie. In my opinion he did better than Bryan Singer. There weren't so many stupid moments that caused me to shake my head. This was hard-hitting. Wolverine got to kill people. Favorite characters got to die. This was serious, and it really uped the ante knowing that no one was safe from termination. Well, everyone but Hugh Jackman, cause he rocks so damn much.Halle Berry can kick the bucket for all I care. She can use lightning but she's just not cut out for comic book movies. And can she STICK with an accent/hairstyle/place in the story? Jean Grey may change into Phoenix but Berry is the real re-inventor around here. I mean, now she can FLY and spin faster than a twister on crack? C'mon. Lets have some continuity here.A great comic book movie except for Halle Berry, X-Men:: The Last Stand gets an A- Now lets move onto that Wolverine movie.",7,2,4,26 May 2006
Across the Universe," Fun, but lack of Britain and what did this have to do with the Beatles?
","Across the Universe - Julie Taymor's homage to the 60s and 70s. I'd call it an homage to the Beatles, but aside from using 33 of their songs (and referring to a few more) and eye-roll-inducingly calling the two main characters Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachael Wood), this movie has no real tie to John, George, Paul or Ringo. Nor, aside from Jude and Mr. Kite (played by the lovable Eddie Izzard), who I'm pretty sure was a hallucination (or was it? It looked so real), is most of the cast British.What shots there are of Britain (at the beginning and end of the film) show a stuffy factory-working bunch of elderly old men. Yeah, it's not like anything happened in Britain during the 60s and 70s anyway, right? Unless you count, um....THE BEATLES! I guess they were all so downtrodden cause we stole their Beatles.I love music and singing. I like Beatles music. I also liked most of the arrangements in the movie. Quite a few caused that goosepimples reaction. I also liked most of the singers. Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, Joe Anderson, and Martin Luther were quite good. Didn't really care for Dada Fuchs as an actress or singer, and I found it kind of funny that SHE was the one to go on as a professional singer in the movie. My favorite has to be Joe Anderson. He had the most charisma, and was also the best written part. I wish that more of the songs weren't pre-recorded (There is a noticeable difference in sound) but I'm happy that the singers did their own singing.There is undeniable power in these tunes, if you're into musicals or just plain Beatles music. I am. Notable entries were 'Hey Jude' 'Come Together' ''Strawberry Fields Forever' 'I Am The Walrus' (How ridiculous was it for Limey-disliking Americans to say words like knickers and 'English Garden and English Rain). Notably weird and therefore personal favorite entires were 'I Want You' and 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite'. 'Twist and Shout' was surprisingly absent, as well as most of the more shallow-pop Beatles songs. I guess Ferris Bueller cornered the market on that one. I was disappointed as I expecting a scene where Jude drunkenly types out one of the more innocuous Beatles songs like 'Love Me Do' or 'P.S. I Love You' in a letter to Lucy.Unfortunately, if the 33 Beatles songs were the films strong point, they were also it's weakness. Sometimes they had little to do with what was actually going on in the movie (or if they did, it was in a very roundabout way) and sometimes I had little clue as to what was going on. The script was kinda 'helter skelter' and thinly tied in with the songs. These are elementary musical mistakes. If you're at the point where you want to get through the dialogue to get to the next song, the musical's in trouble. The music should assist the story, not override it. And this is a paper-thin story. The songs don't reveal or mention much about the characters themselves, aside from the obvious 'Hey Jude', and 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds' doesn't play til the credits roll. What was the point of naming her that then? Events are mentioned that mean little though are meant to mean more. People break up and re-unite for reasons not explained to the audience.This was an ambitious movie, and it suceeded and failed in various places. Loved the singing. Wasn't so crazy about the thin characterization and story. A mix, but mostly enjoyable, Across the Universe gets a B.",7,0,2,27 October 2007
Gran Torino," A taste of old school in these troubled times.
","Gran Torino - Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War vet with a mean temper and an unlimited bag of racist slurs. He unwisely chooses to live in a run down urban area in Detroit with gangs aplomb. After his Hmong next door neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) unsuccessfully tries to steal Walt's Gran Torino, the boy is ordered to work for Walt for absolution.Clint Eastwood delivers a great performance. The man is still damn intimidating, even at 78, with a face chiseled out of concrete and those just plain mean eyes. I'd be hesitant over whether I could take him. He's also damn funny, with his world weary attitude and obvious disappointment with just about everything. The mentioned racial slurs are ever so tongue and cheek, making the film just about as guilty an old school pleasure as can be. It's a comfort knowing, behind the screen, that Eastwood doesn't mean any of them. This also comes through on screen as well because Walt's interactions with the 'Chinks' next door proves many of his assumptions wrong. Gran Torino has a few clichés sure, but the ones used work and work well. It's the truth and feeling behind them that is important.It's the first film Clint has made in a long time I've felt like I could watch over again and probably buy the DVD. Unforgiven, Letters from Iwo Jima, Million Dollar Baby, Changeling... All good to great films. Not a one of them I could sit through and watch again. They're just too painful and touch far too many vulnerable points. Gran Torino has wit to go with it's heart and head. This film considers what is going on in our society and what our younger generations are being passed down. I'm a young man, and I can safely say that generally, my generation is not polite and rather ungrateful. Torino also hits several sore spots considering violence. Eastwood is tired of violence. It's made far too easy down on film and the act of killing has been marginalized over the years without being given the magnitude it deserves.Perhaps it's because I love the Dirty Harry films and Eastwood so much, or perhaps because the film touched the old soul within me that constantly wonders just what the heck is going so wrong right now, but this film really spoke to me. It's one of the best, and last, films of 2008, and I enjoyed every minute. Gran Torino gets an A.",10,2,7,9 January 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Glorified fan-fiction
","Twilight: New Moon - Picking up a little while after the first film, the film again follows the trials and tribulations of Bella (Kirsten Stewart), the plain but beautiful, dull but fascinating girl. She turns the big 18 and the Cullens invite her to a birthday party. An accident ensues, and Edward (Robert Pattinson *swoon*) decides to send his threatening family away so he can live with Bella in piece. Ha ha, just joking. That would have been the smart thing to do. Edward instead decides to leave Bella forever, out of a desire to not hurt her. Surprisingly this does not work as Bella has several hilarious bitch-fits and gets even more inhumanly stupid. She takes ridiculous risks such as taking an ill-advised ride with the biker dudes, cliff diving all in the name of seeing her boyfriend in weird unexplained visions. Man-tastic Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) is there to the rescue, though he is not all he seems to be. Bella must choose which man to go with and the stakes become higher as Edward, with two films to go, decides to kill himself whilst under the impression that Bella is dead.It's funny that it took me so long to write that out, considering the fact that this film has almost as little plot as the first film. In fact by all accounts it is the same film told over. Bella, in a state of sorrow, meets another man and discovers he is a monster inside. Thank god this time she found a man who can even slightly act. Taylor Lautner is warmer and more engaging than Robert Pattinson, who still painfully stammers his lines and always seems to look down at a tree stump next to Bella when he is talking to her. If only they could both keep their shirts on (a thousand times over for Pattinson)! There is enough man-ab action in this film to make Mathew McConaughey blush and put a shirt on. There's also enough terrible CGI to make the guys at Industrial Light & Magic's heads explode. Seriously, I haven't seen effects this bad outside of the Sci-Fi channel.I have finally realized why Stephanie Meyer has done so well with these books. It's not just that they are bastardizations of classical horror themes. It's that they are bastardizations of horror that are especially appealing to girls (or gay men). Androgynous pale men with glitter on? David Bowie's been rocking that look for decades. Werewolf men who never wear shirts? What's next, zombies with codpieces to hold their enormous packages? Some that glitters, however, is gold. Michael Sheen is very watchable as the villain Aro. It was lovely to be reminded what real acting is. Ditto for Ashley Greene as the spunky sister vampire Alice Cullen. Gee, Alice must have considered slitting her immortal wrists a couple of thousand times at reading all the melodramatic drivel Bella kept sending her in a grieved state. I can think of no worse penpal to have. As a matter of fact, can we just follow the story of Alice and the Vampire Illuminati for awhile instead? I'll probably get lynched for saying this, but these films are still an awful influence on young girls. Bella, with an absence of self esteem, is the worst role model for any young women and brings a new low to the empowered girl image everywhere. She tries to kill herself just to get closer to a boy. What could possibly be a weaker character image? Her main bargaining chip in all instances is that she could get hurt. Edward too is an awful influence on young women. He's invasive, domineering and caught up in self loathing. 'My life is awful as an immortal.' Um...maybe if you didn't put yourself through high school for the last 90 years things might be better.New Moon is better than Twilight, though this says nothing. It's funny when it tries to be, and has fewer accidentally funny moments (minus for me actually). It has more likable supporting characters, and only about 20 minutes of Edward Cullen. It's still too damn long and melodramatic. I guess that's what happens when you give fan-fiction a film treatment. D+",4,8,14,24 November 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not art by any means, but very fun.
","Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer - After the death (er...statuizing?) of Dr.Doom the Fantastic Four think life is back to normal. Reed Richards (Ioan Grufford) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) make plans to get married, but are interrupted when the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones/Laurence Fishburne) shows up, trying to destroy the earth and it's up to the fantastic four to deal with him, as well as with the return of Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon).Let me start off by saying that I was never that big a fan of the FF comics (More Batman and Spiderman). I liked the powers and all, and they had some good stories, but they always struck me as the Brady Bunch of the Marvel universe, so squeaky clean and loved by all. And Marvel was always at their hokiest when they tried to get into science. And dear god, WHY did Dr. Doom always narrate his actions in the third person? Still, I liked 2005's 'Fantastic Four' film, which was stomped on the throat by just about everyone (This one has been as well). Not serious enough. Alba couldn't act. Dr. Doom wasn't Darth Vader blah blah blah. That film was a brainlessly fun piece of fluff and so was this one. Everyone's been spoiled by the Batman Begins masterpiece.Let me start with the performances. Grufford is somewhat subdued as Richards, though he gets to show some spunk and initiative this time around. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis have a great little repartee together as The Human Torch and The Thing respectively. Alba has gotten better than last time. She's still not what I'd call an actress, but she's not bad. She doesn't whine or detract from anything and has some funny moments. And I didn't give a crap about how bleached blonde she was. The powers all look good but with a few cheap-looking glitches with Mr. Fantastic. The Surfer looks fantastic but I do wish Doug Jones had gotten to voice-over instead of Fishburne because aside from a few sad looks and gestures they could've had anyone under all that CGI. Don't get me wrong, I like Fishburne and he speaks well without getting too melodramatic, but I love Doug Jones' stuff.The opening 10 minutes of the movie are pretty weak, but it gets much better with the wedding and the Surfer/Torch chase that I'm sure everyone's seen by now with the trailers and all, but it's somehow been given more intensity and fine polish for the film. There are several other action sequences and the movie offers up decent action for a PG film, as well as a particularly cool way to off someone, but I want more. I feel like they used a bunch of the action up in the trailers and TV spots, but there's still loads of cool bits of CGI and whatnot. It's all great turn-your-brain-off stuff. The jokes are well played, but the film lacks a little for seriousness. And I wish Julian McMahon had been given more evil crap to do, cause I like his stuff. There were very few moments where I wasn't enjoying the film.Galactus was a small disappointment, not because he wasn't true to the original comics (which he was). I know there are a huge legion of fanboys livid about that, but I don't think they'd be too happy about a 70 story tall guy in purple Viking armor either. The problem with him/it was there was a certain feeling of awe and magnitude lacking in his arrival. He was also dispatched too easily, which makes me feel that there was no good way to end the movie in a very satisfying way, cause the way the comic ended sucked too.It's a fun movie that you have to turn your brain off to enjoy, because there are stretches of 'scientific' crap (like the comics) that make you go 'Huh? a pulse what?' It's not art, and the movie gleefully acknowledges this and still makes you have a good time. It's fun, it's funny, and it's light-hearted. a C+",5,5,11,18 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Charming film, though treads far too much familiar ground.
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club), this chronicles the life of a man named Benjamin (Brad Pitt) who ages physically in reverse. A fairly original premise that touches lightly on messages of life and death, this is a charming, often touching little movie.Brad Pitt gives a quiet somewhat subdued performance. His character of Benjamin is always quite reserved, presumably to the inevitability of death. His introspect is mostly limited to the notes he makes in a journal, which is unfortunate. Cate Blanchett plays his main romantic interest Daisy. They have a sweet and (at the end) absolutely heart-breaking relationship. Yes, this is a tear-jerker, and your liking of the film depends on your taste for having your emotions manipulated. Personally I have no problems with that.This film is strongly reminiscent of Big Fish, Edward Scissorhands, and Forrest Gump. With the same writer of the wonderful Forrest Gump, Benjamin Button treads a lot of known ground. It's told in the 'hospital bed' manner that most of these films share. This is lovely to people that enjoy more of the same, but annoying to this reviewer given the uniqueness of the film's premise. The beginning and end of this film are very interesting. The middle could be picked from any number of biopics. No one outside of his immediate relations ever seems to notice that Brad Pitt's character ages in reverse. It would be an interesting twist if Ben was grabbed and experimented on. It would be interesting to explore how a 20 year old in appearance would be with a 55 year old's personality. Alas, the film does the Hollywood thing, takes an original premise and sees how close it can get back to the usual thing people expect.This is disappointing considering it's David Fincher, whose previous films look nothing like this. It's a pretty good film, whatever my misgivings might indicate. Fincher has the taste for sentimentality, but his inexperience with this sort of film has made him toe the line to retain the box office and a chance at the Oscars. There might be one in the future of Best Make-up, but that's all I can see. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button gets a B+",8,1,2,26 December 2008
Transformers," More than meets the eye? The film is EXACTLY what it appears to be
","Transformers - Sam Witwicky (name alone tells you how seriously they took the subject matter) finds an old Camero that uses some Herbie and Nightrider tricks in the hope of getting Sam laid by no-way-in-he11-is-she-in-high-school Mikaela Bane (Megan Fox). It turns out the weird car is *gasp* a ROBOT IN DISGUISE! by the name of Bumblebee. The robot sends out a signal to the coolest Autobot (Good guy for short) ever and step-father to a generation of small boys in the 80s, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen).Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving and he11 if I could've figured out it was him, and I loved V for Vendetta) is on Earth and is after a cube. Why? That's not important right now. He's a Decepticon, and if you can't keep them straight it's in the bloody name. DECEPT-icon. Like deception= bad guy. Oh who gives a crap. Look the point is that there are some wonderfully intense robot on robot action sequences. Crap gets blown up. And I hate Bay, but he sure can blow things up.Transformers is quite possibly the dumbest movie that you may find this summer. Parts of it may also be the most fun you'll have at the cinema this year. Hence I'm torn about this movie.The music keeps telling you otherwise, but huge chunks of dialog in this film are jarringly awful. Nearly everything is played for laughs. And there are plot holes galore with no logic save action movie logic. Every minute the robots are not on screen is a moment wasted. The script felt like a couple of teenage boys just willed for the coolest stuff to happen in their own alternate universe.'I only got a B- on a project where all I did was hock my granddad's crap for 3 minutes? I can convince my teacher to raise it to an A-.''The coolest girl in the class? Yeah. She's on Maxim's top 100 Hottest Women list, and nevermind her popular asshole boyfriend and my awful attempts at wooing her. She's going to like me eventually, and (I sh!t you not, this actually happens) sit on my lap, just because the movie says so.' Yeah right toy-boy. In your dreams. The film almost has a mad brilliance to it. It's like Bay knows we'll stomach these laughably tired things he does for the sake of those f***ing awesome robots.Boy does he know us well. Hook, line, and sinker. Those robots are enormous, kick @ss, and were money well spent. I could watch them transform into robots and back over and over and never get bored. There's one that's a tank, there are two awesome jets. There's even one that's a Mountain Dew machine in perhaps the most shameless product placement in cinema history. A minor problem I had though was that it was kind of hard to tell who was who sometimes. Megatron and Starscream kinda looked alike at a glance. Fans of the series will be mixed on the whole because the robots WERE awesome and true (for the most part) to the series they love so well. It's the humans that gum up the works.Jon Voight plays perhaps the most inept Secretary of Defense I've ever seen. John Tuturro is kinda ineffective, kinda creepy, kinda lame. Where was the menace I saw in 'O Brother Where Art Thou' and 'Secret Window'? Anthony Anderson continues down the pathway of 'Chubby Comic Relief' hell. Shia LaBeouf is alright as the awkward protagonist. It's mostly this god-awful script that the cast has to deal with. Nearly everything is played for laughs. The robots are fine for the most part. Megatron and his Decpeticons ooze menace and Prime is fatherly and the Autobots are likable. It's just shame that the film didn't center around them.The movie was made for the big screen, and will be worthless by the time the DVD scrolls around, so see it now, not then. Bay is still a hack, but he shore done made them robots and explosions purdy and will doubtless make a bundle from this very fun, astronomically flawed movie.I give Transformers a B-. Oh, and did I mention how cool the Transformers are?",5,1,3,10 July 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," One of the most important films ever made.
","Good Night, and Good Luck - Broadcast journalist Edward Murrow (David Strathairn) looks to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy (himself) in this finely crafted movie by George Clooney. Much thanks George. All is forgiven for Batman and Robin and The Perfect Storm. This is a perfect period piece that is applicable to virtually any time in America (including now). A person of political stature trying to rule by terror and preying on the innocent? Bingo! David Strathairn has probably made his career with his portrayal of Edward Murrow. Calculating and intelligent, he is able to evoke emotion from the audience with the slightest look or raise of an eyebrow. George plays the loyal Fred Friendly and the two actors have good chemistry. The rest of the cast is fine. Frank Langella makes for an intimidating boss. The screenplay is well written, thought provoking and witty. A wonderful and believable underdog story. Short and entertaining enough to hold the attention span of even those that don't like historical films, and powerful and simple enough in its message to be one of the most important films ever made.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Resident Evil 2/ Paul S. Anderson needs to die. SLOWLY.
","So tonight I was in a mood for pain, and boy did Resident Evil2 meet my needs. The only cool highlights of seeing the movie were a reference to GTA3 (Thereby cementing the fact that the movie needs to steal from better things to survive), and a preview for a much scarier looking film : White Noise. This one looks wicked creepier than the film I actually went to see. I won't even talk about acting because it is like shooting fish in a barrel. On a related note, why was everyone so eager to see the character of Jill Valentine? She was hot and all and wore mini-skirts, but reeked of that horrible Tomb Raider movie and was about as bland and expressionless as a mannequin.There were no scares because I could predict everything that was supposed to scare us about 2 minutes before it happened. They were all of the lowest 'BOO' quality because no one knew how to properly build tension in the movie. The zombies were drunks with a biting problem. It's impossible to believe they can take over an entire city when they can't even walk straight. The sub baddies (lickers and zombie dogs) should've gotten more screen time as they WERE kinda cool. Nemesis at first was cool but then got lamer and lamer as the movie went on. The script was totally illogical. Would it be too much trouble for Paul S. Anderson to at least make us think there is a chance in hell of say, an ending? Not necessarily a good one, but an ending? Does he know how to do anything but make bad movies that demand sequels? I bet he took about half an hour to whip up the story for this. I'd bet even more that I could whip up a better movie story to this than he could. At least he didn't have the funny black guy die. I could go on, but you get the idea. This gets a D-.",1,5,11,2 June 2005
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Heavy, compelling, sensitive and sad.
","The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas - When young Bruno (Asa Butterfield)'s father (David Thewlis), an SS man, is sent to work at Auschwitz, Bruno makes friends with a Jewish boy named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). Through the camp's electrified fence, their friendship grows and Bruno gradually learns of the sinister nature of his father's work.What the film drives home is that not all Germans approved of the Nazi regime's plans and ideals. Is it a sad movie? Of course it is (particularly for mothers. hint hint). The Holocaust is such a grim subject that it's impossible, and beyond the point, to make a film about it that isn't sad. What is important is what this film does differently from prior Holocaust films. It's a story about friendship, redemption and fulfilling oaths. The exact events are fictitious, but does that really matter? There were millions of deaths and there were some German sympathizers, so the story rings true in any case.Asa Butterfield gives a genuinely sweet performance as Bruno. He is imaginative, good-hearted, and almost entirely in the dark about what is going on, as would any 8 year old. And though he is in the dark, he sees clearer than many people around him because he's such an innocent. As such, we often see things from his perspective. Vera Farmiga has an interesting character evolution as Bruno's mother. She goes from ignorance and obedience to rebellious as she quickly sees her husband and the 'camps' in a new light. David Thewlis is cold yet not uncaring to his family, though he seems to always put his duties before fatherhood. It is interesting to note that Nazis did try to keep their families in the dark about what was going on, much as they 'believed' that their actions were the correct ones.One minor performance that was actually the most moving for me was the part of Pavel the Jewish servant (David Hayman) who was previously a doctor. He says practically nothing, but you can see it in his eyes just bursting to come out of him.The end of the film is telegraphed and seems to come in terribly slow motion. Much as the film is light and has self-aware humor at the beginning, it's often terribly dark. It's a good film, and a decent tearjerker.Heavy, compelling, sensitive and sad, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas gets a B+",8,3,5,27 November 2008
Paranormal Activity," I can honestly say I've never been more terrified.
","Paranormal Activity - Micah and Kate are a couple with a large house and a camera that they will not turn off. This is not a haunted house. Kate is the one who is haunted and has been since she was a child. She is haunted by a ghost so malevolent it is known as a demon. She and her husband are never alone, never safe, and never at ease.And neither are you.Brrrrr....This film brings to mind the most primal sense of fear and never stops hammering away at your sense of personal safety. If you've ever had paranormal experiences or just unexplainable ones, this film will bring them all back to the present. It does not stray far from the realm of possibility, unless you count how spacious a home this couple has, and one particularly dim-witted (well several, but what would you do in the situation?) mistake made by Micah. The biggest fear we have is not zombies or vampires, but a conscious malevolent unknown. Bottom line, you never see ANYTHING.Without giving much of anything away, nor building you up with false promises, I can say this is the scariest film I have ever seen. It's a slow build, yet I felt like I was going through hell at points. It just never ends. And then it does. And it stays with you. I have never been so scared by a film in my life.This film does it's job brilliantly, and was almost thrown away by the Hollywood folk. It proves just how ineffective the current horror industry is at producing genuine terror like what this film offers. This is eons better than Blair Witch, Cloverfield, or any of the other shaky cam films. It gets a well-deserved A, and is not recommended for people with heart conditions, weak constitutions, and my parents.A.",10,1,5,11 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - Tim Burton's take on the famous Ronald Dahl novel. Though Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is sweet, sensitive and good natured, just as Charlie should be, this is Johnny Depp's show. As Willy Wonka, he is kooky, awkward, and always funny. The camera just gravitates to what he is doing at all times. His voice is a sort of hybrid California Girl giggle mixed with someone slightly Canadian. And not every other sentence out of his mouth is a literary quote. David Kelly seems far less creepy than he did in the trailer, but rather a very endearing grandfather. The four little devils all have plenty of personality to go around, and sometimes too much so. I think everyone'll be glad to see them meet their inevitable punishment.Surprisingly, Burton's version is far less dark than the 70's version. I actually liked that we saw the four greedy children alive and well after their mistakes, whereas in the other movie it was rather like 'Maybe they're dead. Maybe they're alright. Who cares?' This happy ending isn't held back by 4 possibly dead children who paid through the roof for their foolish mistakes, because we see them alright, or severely altered.I was a little unsure about the script writer John August, because I saw the dastardly Charlies Angels2 movie. Surprisingly this script is filled with humor and moments both tender and awkward (but in a good funny way). Wonka and Charlie both have more fleshed out with family backstories which adds to the characters. Charlie has his loving mother and father (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) who we see in quite a few scenes. Wonka has his dentist father (Christopher Lee), whose strict rules on candy caused Wonka to go into the business of candy-making. There are way too many funny quotes to count.As with all Tim Burton movies, atmosphere is the name of the game. Wonka factory is this giant factory amid all the little people, with Charlie and his family living in this little shack that would not meet even the loosest of building requirements. England is dull and snowy. The jungles of Loompaland are vibrant and earthy. Wonka's factory is bright and colorful. The production values are top-notch.In conclusion, if you were not taken with the other Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie, as I was, give this a try. Sorry Gene Wilder, but I like Depp's performance better. This gets an A-",8,5,8,15 July 2005
The Dark Knight," The Batman we deserve? Maybe. But not the one that completely satisfies.
","The Dark Knight - The mob responds to the Batman (Christian Bale)'s actions by bringing in a psychopath named The Joker (Heath Ledger) to wreak havoc and corruption. Both sides look to newly appointed District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) as a focal point. To Batman, Dent is a White Knight whose reign allows Bats the chance to give up the cape and cowl. To the Joker, Dent is a target.I won't lie. I'm a huge Batman fan. And I wholeheartedly enjoyed this movie. But I think that this may be a dangerous case of the hype engine in overdrive. I think I may have liked Batman Begins more. I can't tell yet. It's neck and neck. One visible problem is Batman's reduced role in the movie. Yes he's doing stuff, most of it is very cool (Where's the Batarang action though?). And I like how they delved more into the detective side of his character. But there are fewer moments of introspect than in Begins. The first third or so of the movie is Batman's movie, but the rest belongs to the 'freaks' as it goes on. It's more about the villain's response to Batman's actions, making a third film so richly deserved. Whether Nolan is willing to crank another one out (and It's getting really tiresome how he keeps hanging the prospect over our heads) remains to be seen. But man I hope so.There's no slight in the performances. Bale is in top form, though the material focuses less on him. Michael Caine is similarly great and side-lined. Heath Ledger is spectacular; the hype engine surrounding him is well justified. The little touches he adds. The twitches, the lip-smacks, the cruel sense of humor. It's perfection. He's ten times the Joker Jack Nicholson was. I wish there was more of him in the film, and I think they might have reduced his part. You just even forget he's under the make-up. It's a snowflake of a performance that will never be repeated.Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent very well. He's very likable and tragic, and Nolan got his origin bang on. I almost wish he had saved it for another film. Maggie Gyllenhall is a far better actress than Katie Holmes. Not just as Rachel Dawes, but in general. And Gary Oldman kicks ass as Commissioner Gordon. Cillian Murphy has a welcome cameo. The action sequences kick ass. I'd be hard pressed to say my favorite scene, and since no one wants spoilers I really shouldn't say.The ending is dark and interesting and dissatisfying all in one. The reboot can't end with this film. There's more to be had. And it would be so easy to transpose Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (mostly) into the conclusion for this film. One can only hope. Don't leave us hanging Chris! A-",9,2,6,18 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Very good. Surpases the book even, but GoF is still the best movie.
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, who is getting better and better) enters his fifth year at Hogwarts, and a shadowy threat grows outside and within the school walls. The threat outside is in the form of scary @ss Voldemort (played by scary-@ss Ralph Fiennes). The threat within is pink, obnoxiously evil Doloros Umbridge (played to horrifying perfection by Imelda Staunton), a plant from the Ministry of Magic who believes that Albus Dumbledore is trying to use wide-spread fear of said Voldemort to usurp said Ministry of Magic. Harry and his classmates rebel from the imperialist thumb of this woman by forming a Defensive Magic club.Of course, if you'd read the books you'd know all this, and if you are going in without reading the books or at least seeing the other movies, you made a stupid decision. This film does not stand alone and if you're a cynical adult critic, see something else. Why should the film lose points for building on the plots of the others? No one seemed to complain about it in the Lord of the Rings movies, or the Star Wars films.Fanbase issues aside, the is perhaps one of the best of the lot so far. I loved Goblet of Fire, and all the adult critics gravitated towards Prisoner of Azkaban like catnip for some reason. The film had the most going against it of all the films so far. It's a 2 hour 20 minute version of a 800 page book, yet it breezily goes through the plot and makes it comprehensive without losing any of the book's charm or seeming like a 'Best of' clip show. In fact, I would go so far as to say it amplified the charm of my lesser favorite of the books. Much props to the editors. They agreed to do what no previous director had dared to do. MONTAGES! No, not the dreaded 'm' word! Yes they did. And it serves the film well.Maybe hiring TV director David Yates was a good call after all. Right from the start the movie has a totally new richer darker feel to it. Harry and cousin Dudley are attacked in a tunnel, straight out of Jacob's Ladder, by Dementors, who seem to have a new look and even rougher attitude.Of course, some critics have made this film out to be a funeral march. Not true. It's not all dark and despair. There is still loads of fun to be had, but when snake headed Ralph Fiennes is right outside your backyard waiting to kill you, how much fun can you have? By Harry's side is a legion of excellent supporting cast. They seem to have picked most of my favorite British actors, Alan Rickman and Brendan Gleeson (who I hope is given more to do in the remaining two films) at the forefront. Gary Oldman is wonderful in this new fad of his to not play bad-guys. Jason Isaccs returns with promising psychotic newbie Helena Bonham Carter as Death Eaters Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange, and oh hell, there's too much wonderful acting. You could literally remove half of the huge cast and still have enough quality British actors to do a rousing Hamlet, Othello, and Macbeth. My personal favs have to be Evana Lynch as the wonderful wayward hippy Luna Lovegood and Mathew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, who has really come into his own. Daniel Radcliffe also shows dramatic improvement in his best round as Harry yet. I like Emma Watson, but she could take a page from Dan and do a few plays. It's not entirely her fault as she's only given exposition to say, but something to change her speaking pattern and keep those eyebrows from not rising up and down every time she talks.The movie manages to make the least cinematic of the books into a movie where something rousing is there around every corner, and it still manages to seem like the kids are going to school. There is an anormous awe-inspiring magic streetfight at the end. I'd give the film full marks, but it feels like there could have been a little more room for emotion and grieving (look! spoilers!) had they made time and not hurried everything along at the end.Nearly the best yet but second to GoF, Order of the Phoenix gets an A- Now lets all find out how this ENDS. I hope JKR doesn't 'Sopranos' the ending.",9,0,0,12 July 2007
Taken," Fun but predictable.
","Taken - Brian is divorced but still deeply loves his daughter. Consequently he's very protective of her, and doesn't want her to go to France. Brian relents and, sure enough, the daughter is kidnapped in France and he goes in to bust some heads and rescue her. Also along for the ride is Famke Janssen as the bitchy ex-wife Lenore, and that's about as much of a character as she gets.Look, there's not a whole lot in this film that has not been done before. Your taste for this is limited to how much you enjoy Liam Neeson knocking out, killing, or otherwise incapacitating 50 or 60 people. As unbelievable as that sounds...no strike it. It's just largely unbelievable. There are many things that are unbelievable in this film, such as killing so many people, in another country no less, with no repercussions. Also the various technological devices used to get Brian from points A to B to C border on magic. But the fights are so pretty and hard and fast.Liam Neeson does a decent turn as Brian. I love his attempt at an American accent. I hope it replaces Arnold's voice in popularity in the 21st century. It's hard to believe his able to go from mildly over-protective humble giant to Frank Castle in the course of a plane trip, but those who have lost family members in the past are free to dispute that. His willingness to put innocents in similar predicaments does him for favors in my eyes though.In the end we learn four crucial lessons from this: 1) Never go to a foreign country. 2) Foreign countries only want to sell our women for prostitution. 3) Over protective fathers are always right. and 4) A father's love for his daughter extends to using torture on others to ensure her safety. Why oh why do we have a film advertising torture days after a new president bans it's use? *sigh* I just had to laugh afterwards. All the film needed at the end was a 'This could happen to YOU!!!' Fun, fast, simple-minded and hard-edged. Just don't go in expecting any life lessons whatsoever. B-",6,1,4,31 January 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Incredibly pedestrian given the subject matter and the director!.
","Alice in Wonderland - Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now 20 years old, is being forced into an arranged marriage and decides to escape again to Wonderland. She finds her old band of weird misfit characters, The Hatter (Johnny Depp), The Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), The Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman), who all seem to know each other this time around. Team Alice must take on the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and it is up to Alice to slay the mighty Jabberwocky.Of all the good directors to lose their touch, Burton's descent is probably the most interesting. Don't get me wrong, I love Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Big Fish, and Sleepy Hollow very much, but Burton has undeniably lost his touch over the last few years. A man always attracted to images, he has always enjoyed the imagery of horror but not necessarily the pathos behind it. Motivations and details tend to elude Burton's characters and their worlds in his works. Burton has gotten frankly lazy with his casting over the years. Now, in Burton's seventh film with Johnny Depp and his most eye popping yet conventional film yet, it is clear that Burton is comfortable in just letting the imagery and Danny Elfman's music do the dramatic work for him. If I found parts of Sweeney Todd boring and emotionally vapid, it had nothing on large chunks of Wonderland. There is not an ounce of drama to be found anywhere. Now I ask why would a man who has admitted to not being familiar with fairy tales or good scripts, desire to do Alice in Wonderland? If one had large chunks of time to spare, they could go over what a weird mistake it was to put Alice, whose original adventures ARE the archetype for the woman's adventure, squarely in an archetypal male's adventure of achieving their destiny by slaying a dragon. I mean really, what was the point of rebooting Alice just to turn it into Narnia? This is not entirely Burton's fault. Linda Woolverton, who wrote The Lion King, is also behind this.If there is one place where schmaltz, logic, conventionality, epic battles and foretold prophecies/destinies, should be forbidden, it's Wonderland. Gone is the political satire, the wackiness and the randomness of Wonderland. Mr. Burton, good lord but what were you thinking? Mia Wasikowska is completely lacking in charisma. I liked some of the things Depp tried to do with Mad Hatter, even if a random Scottish accent appears sometimes and a horrendously inappropriate hip-hop routine comes out of freaking nowhere at the end. Ironically, trying to give the Hatter depth was a huge mistake. Stephen Fry is pitch perfect as the Cheshire Cat. Alan Rickman's voice is similarly great for the Caterpillar. Helena Bonham Carter raises the performance level some with The Red Queen. Anne Hathaway looks vacant and sashays around as the White Queen. The film is beautiful, and Burton fans will be satisfied. It is, I repeat, a shallow conventional Wonderland. Alice in Wonderland gets a C-.",5,3,7,6 March 2010
Avatar," Moving blockbuster with appeal to all ages.
","Avatar - Avatar is James Cameron's much awaited epic - the likes of which has not been seen in several years. It's great to know that something this long in the making was actually worth the wait. Jake (Sam Worthington) is a marine sent to replace his twin brother in a mission on an enemy planet. Jake is uploaded into an 'Avatar', a genetic copy of the Na'vi the alien race he is to infiltrate. Jake's loyalties are put to the test.Avatar reinforces why certain ideas, now scathingly called cliché in the first place, are still so potent in the collective unconsciousness. The problem with so many films that tried and failed to utilize similar themes, is they have lacked the emotional maturity and depth of Avatar. The mere fact that Avatar succeeds so well indicates the truth of it's message. Is Jake going to convert? Of course he is. A relatable realistic portrayal of Jake by Sam Worthington makes us believe this. Who wouldn't want to fly? Who wouldn't want to see so much simple natural beauty and trade it in a heartbeat for their mechanized, false environment? One of the things I liked with that Jake's defection was not just for the sake of his co-star Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), who is played with vitality and heart.There is great work form the ensemble. Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore all give quality work as the good guys. Stephen Lang plays the badass villain Colonel Miles Quaritch, while Giovanni Ribisi plays a scummy corporate shill.The aesthetics and scope of the film are incredible. Whether it is seen in 3-D or not the film is a work of art. The planet is gorgeous from head to toe. Its destruction is a painful reminder of the Amazon Rainforest. Some of the creatures resemble underwater creatures, whilst others bear resemblance to the conquered by nature dinosaurs. The Na'vi are a subtle mix of various conquered peoples through history. Part Indian in bone structure, part African. And who took these people by storm in the first place you ask? It is a look into the other side's shoes that Avatar provides. We haven't been the good guys for a long time guys. I love my troops for their sacrifices, but I feel that these are very much the wrong wars.The film succeeds at being preachy by diving in with it's heart on it's sleeve. The message isn't tacked on: We are the assholes when we go forth with our worst instincts for cruelty and greed. The message is strengthened by a millenia of history. The film jogs it's viewers over to the side of peace and naturalism and has them rejecting corporate greed and military strong-arming in the course of three hours. If that's not a testament to the amazing power of correctly done film than I'm not sure what is.My tiny problem is the choice of the name for the precious metal the Earthers desire so badly: unobtainium. Yeesh. C'mon guys. How about a little subtlety for audience members over the age of 12? How about 'nofindium' or 'macguffium'. In such a well crafted film, this feels like a first draft problem everyone was too deeply involved on the project to feel like changing.Several sites indicate that two sequels are in the works. My initial response was a groan, as I thought this was a great stand-alone film that needed no further examination, but this is James Cameron the master of sequels we're talking about here. I'm sure this will bear amazing children for the years to come.2009 was a sorry year in many respects, but film was not one of them. Virtually all of the films I deeply enjoyed for using their brains, brawn and wit were financial successes. Perhaps the mass appetite/recognition for quality has not been diminished, only starved in the past few years. Maybe there is hope after all. If we're going to survive, we'll need intelligence, artistry, and ecological conscientiousness, whether we like it or not.Avatar gets an A.",10,29,49,31 December 2009
The Descent," A bloody good scare.
","The Descent - Six women go spelunking in an unknown cavern. But the cavern is not all it seems, and their survival skills are put to the test.Let me start off by saying that I do not often go to see horror films in theater (The last one would be Silent Hill, which I had mixed feelings about) because I find them to be lackluster in general. Let me say that this one is by far one of the scariest movies in the past few years. My friends were not as scared by it as I, but they still admitted that it was a fine piece of work.I don't want to spoil anything for you, btu suffice to say that the film is content to play out the 'Jaws' element for the first half hour and let us get to know these women better. The casting, which is by far the folly of your average horror flick, was well done and these six girls are believable (for the most part. Who goes into an unknown cave in the first place?) and in numerous scenes, applaudable for their actions.The scares at first are psychological, playing out almost everyone's fears of claustrophobia, heights, and the dark, all done, in a very documentary-esquire way of filming, but not like Blair Witch where the cameras motion itself is the nauseating thing. There is also a great deal of gore. This is hardly for people with weak constitutions or bladders.My friends and I were unable to agree on the level of scaritude (if I may invent a phrase here). They argued that the movie put too much into the sound effects so that even if you knew something was going to happen it was still a huge jump when it did happen because of the level of sound used. I think this worked to the movie's advantage more than it's detriment, as the result was more shocking and frightening.The film never clarifies why any of this is happening, but I rather liked that it was unencombered by copious exposition.This is not only a frightening and well done piece of film, but it has put me off of spelunking for life. This is a better and (strangely) more believable piece of work than than Saw and Bostel. For horror afficianados, one not to miss. I give it a B+",8,1,3,5 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," a summer blockbuster suspense movie that makes you think
","The Da Vinci Code - Ron Howard's adaptation of the infamous novel in which Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou, a favorite of mine) unmask a mystery involving Mary Magdalene's place in the Catholic Church, and the finding of the Holy Grail. I've been told by nit-picks that I don't include enough plot details. You want a total synopsis, see the movie.Anywho, Lot of big names in this one, and not coincidently, a lot of good performances. Hanks does well as Langdon, and Tautou even better as Neveu. Ian McKellen has great fun with his screen time and is quite good at clearing through lengthy exposition (There's quite a bit in this movie, but it's all done quite well). There's suspense and intrigue, and no one is quite who they say they are. It kept me on my toes for the movie's two and a half hour run. Jean Reno and Alfred Molina have slightly less time on screen and bring strong support to the table. Paul Bettany is quite shocking and scary in his role as Silas.The film is about 98% fiction, but personally I've always wondered why we've promoted Jesus into a deity. 'Does mortality take away the splendor of his deeds?' is one of the themes the film goes into, and it really makes you think.I have not read the book, but I am told that this was pretty much the same experience. If you liked the book, you'll like the movie. If you haven't read the book, give this film a run. It's a summer blockbuster suspense movie that makes you think. I couldn't have asked for more.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Dark, and funny.
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Harry (Dan Radcliffe) enters his fourth year of Hogwarts and is entered into the incredibly dangerous Triwizard tournament by an anonymous stranger. All hail to Mike Newell, the director of this masterpiece! The movie forgoes the happiness and frivolity of the previous movies and replaces it with teen problems (done very funnily of course), epic action sequences and hilarious British humor.Coming back to the show are the fantastic three. Dan has come into his own. He is Harry. He is vulnerable, angry, not always sure what to do, and has actually gotten quite good at comedy routines. Rupert Grint is not just used for comedic relief this time. He gets jealous of Harry for getting into the tournament, and is tired of being referred to as 'Harry Potter's Stupid Friend'. Emma Watson is beautiful and plays the supporter of Harry largely, but does it well. The other children are a blast to watch, especially Neville and Fred and George. I liked how more attention came to the character of Cedric Diggory, and his brief relationship to Harry.The adult actors are sparingly but well used. Alan Rickman only has two main scenes (He probably did about one day of filming) but it's just enough. Maggie Smith is equally funny and Micheal Gambon is used more than in the previous film. He thankfully has one fatherly scene in this film, which was lacking in PoA. Brendan Gleeson is hilariously over-the-top as 'Mad-Eye', a vicious old dark wizard catcher assigned to be the new Dark Arts teacher.The humor has grown more adult, which fits the growing audience better. Sexuality and Excellent Writing replace most of the repetition gags and silly physical humor of Columbus and Cuaron. This fits J.K. Rowling's style much better actually. It's all very funny and very British, as it should be. As for the teen problems? Getting a date for the dance, and learning to dance. Dealing with rejection and hormones. We've all been there. It's all very real and well done. These kids feel like real people, not mythical elves or gods.The movie is close to 3 hours, but chances are you'll spend most of it either laughing or terrified. Harry's round with the dragon is intensely scary but amazing. His second task, slightly less so, but the dragon was a tough act to follow. The maze is scary, easily a villain by itself. Think 'The Shining' on crack. The finale will leave pretty much anyone with a soul breathless and crying. Ralph Fiennes is terrifying as Voldemort. Dark times indeed.Not for anyone who hasn't seen the other movies or read the books (or doesn't want to because it's not 'cool'), but who gives a crap about them? Not for kids under 12 (they'll go to see it anyway, I've seen 7 year olds read the 6th book), but this stuff is scary for anyone. Diehards who want every side-plot of the book included will be disappointed. C'mon guys, the movie's almost 3 hours anyway (Though I was genuinely disappointed at the lack of further exposition about Neville Longbottom)! The movie does the best at being comprehensible without aid of reference from the books of it's predecessors, and is a genuinely exceptional comedy/thriller, and feels epic and yet real. And that's a tall order to deliver for a story about magic and a wizard. Mike Newell is a god truly.Not for the faint of heart, this gets an A",10,142,234,18 November 2005
Zombieland," Catches most of the love behind the Zombie fantasy.
","Zombieland - The world is once again (or maybe it's the same virus as the one in Shaun of the Dead) ravaged by a virus that turns the world's population into hordes of mobile (is the running/walking debacle really so worthy of ire? Either would destroy the world) cannibals. The main character is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a squeamish nerd who has survived so long because of strict adherence to a rulebook that neatly skips over most of the mistakes horror film characters fall prey to. He soon meets Tallahassee (played with vinegar and vigor by Woody Harrelson), a man with a savage penchant for killing zombies. They meet two untrustworthy young women (Emma Stone and Abigail Bresnin) and the four slug it out joyfully in an apocalypse of enormous proportions.The film marvelously captures most of the love most teenage men have for the zombie scenario. In a word or two: legitimized anarchy. If the story lacks direction for any reason it's this. One of the best sequences (of which there are several) shows the foursome breaking everything in a shop just because they can. The jokes come often and are amusing, with pop culture references aplenty. One cameo made me fall in love with the film. There really is nothing like the comedy greats of the 80s and 90s, is there? The opening credits sequence would be the best if the Dawn of the Dead remake hadn't done theirs so perfectly.The film only sparingly adheres to reality so as not to detract from the fantasy. Running out of ammunition never seems to happen. It's hard to imagine three out of four of the crew, capable as they are at times, faring any better than millions of other people, much less the US Army. But speculation about that hardly seems the point of the film. The final quarter is nothing if not constant visceral fun.If I have some minor issues, apart from the ammo tiffs, it's this: The casting of the film seems extremely calculated. We have a kid that looks and acts like Michael Cera, the hot girl from Superbad, the cute kid from Little Miss Sunshine, and Woody Harrelson. If there weren't zombie nudity, blood, and cussing here I'd say it's practically a family friendly film. I've become a little less of a fan of comedy relying on pop culture over the years because it relies on an audience's knowledge of other films, not the film standing on it's own merits. But I don't want to flog an undead horse too harshly, especially such an entertaining one. I'd gladly watch Zombieland again, and it remains at least the second best zombie comedy ever.The masses have spoken: we love us some zombie films, and it is a fantasy that will likely spawn countless more movies, both comedic and horrific, being made. And for once, I'm okay with that. A-",8,1,2,13 October 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Skip it. You'll be happier and smarter for doing so.
","A wife (Angelina Jolie) and husband (Brad Pitt), both with secret identities as hit-men, are given contracts to kill each other. This movie has some genuine laughs, but just does not work. It is incredibly implausible and silly. While this is not normally a problem (I thrive on silly movies) the movie ultimately fails when it tries to up the drama factor. How can this be taken seriously? Two people, one named Jane Doe, the other John Smith, marry each other spontaneously while not being the least bit suspicious of each other's backgrounds? Even if I wasn't a trained assassin, I would be suspicious. Stu-pid. And it takes them 5-6 years to figure this out? Stu-pider. The acting is fine. Brad plays Brad (and he's done it well over the years) Angelina plays herself. There are a few funny moments supplied mostly by Vince Vaughn, and when Brad and Angeline are trying to conceal their secret identities and later when they try to kill each other (spousal abuse is funny!), but eventually it reclines back into every unmemorable action movie you've ever seen. The bullets become ignorable because there's no way the stars'll die (Even the Terminator was more destructible). You know how the plot ends. Bor-ing. This gets a C",6,32,65,11 June 2005
The Departed," Same problem as with 'The Aviator'. Scorcese won't take home the Oscar.
","The Departed - The Departed is set in South Boston, where the state police force is waging war on Irish-American organized crime. Young undercover cop Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Billy quickly gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan (Damon), a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the syndicate, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit.First off, this movie has the usual strengths of a Scorcese film. Firstly, a strong performance from Dicaprio and downright brilliant performances from the supporters .In The Aviator it was Cate Blanchett, in The Departed it is Jack Nicholson. My god, the man has created such a chilling and funny villain that somehow avoids being over-the top. Believe it or not, I didn't loath him half as much as I hated Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan. The man was such a weasely runt of a social climber that one couldn't help but hate him. The film also has strong support from Mark Wahlberg as a trash-talking sergeant, Martin Sheen as Captain Queenan, and Alec Baldwin in a serious movie for once (in the last few years) it seems.The film also has a strong script and great camera work. The violence is sparingly used but effective. The film's drawback is Scorcese's continual mistake: He doesn't know when enough is enough. He gets too leisurely with the pace of his films, and doesn't know how to make me sit through them either. It wasn't as weary long as The Aviator, but I was still looking at my imaginary watch far too many times. The movie's two and a half hours long, but it felt even longer. People always lament that Scorzese never takes home The Best Film Award, and this is the reason: He continually turns in the A- film, but different people keep on turning in the A film each year.A very good film, but I was happiest when The Departed finally departed. It gets an A-",8,1,2,8 October 2006
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Cute, sweet. Girls'll flock to it.
","Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist - Two kids in the various stages of bad relationships, Nick and Nora (Michael Cera and Kat Dennings), meet each other at a concert. They have a night of hi-jinx involving taking care of/ searching for Nora's drunken friend and an elusive cult band. This is directed by newbie director Peter Sollet and written by newbie writer Lorene Scafaria.This move is cute and at times delightful. The target audience, based on the trailers that preceded it, is definitely girls (and, judging by who the mass majority of the audience was, they succeeded). The studios have hit on the fact that the girls like this Michael Cera kid. I have mixed feelings about him overall. He's not an actor. He's a star. The difference is that actors can play a multitude of different characters, often with the audience forgetting it's the actor. Cera has awkwardness down to a finely tuned craft, but he's only as good as who he is paired with. And therefore I'd say the bigger credit goes to Kat Dennings, who is a fine young actress and I expect big things from her in the future.I did not come out of this hating Aaron Yoo, a fact that surprised me. Kudos to the makers for including gay men in the main cast. This is the 21st century. Gay men can and should do more in movies than be bffs to the leading female (that this movie breaks that mold depends on your opinions of Michael Cera's masculinity) and fashion designers telling Anne Hathaway how fat and unattractive she is. Aaron Yoo, Rafi Gavron and Jonathan B. Wright provide able comedic support in what I hope is not a career ending move for the latter two.As I said, it's a cute movie. There are a few moments of lag or predictability and others of questionable character motivations, but it is a teen comedy after all. There is one moment near the end at the recording studio that left me roaring. I would have paid extra for a scene after the credits between Nora and her father regarding what happens in that scene. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Ah it's probably best to leave it to the imagination.Ironicaly most of the soundtrack to the movie is forgettable, but I'd take it in a heartbeat over the Juno soundtrack. All in all it doesn't matter what I say. This movie is going to steamroll everything else in theater. Girls are going to see it mostly, but boys who are dragged along will find they had a good time as well. Hooray to Michael Cera scoring another girl way out of his league, thanks to the magic of cinema.Good but not great, Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist gets a B.",7,8,17,4 October 2008
Wedding Crashers," Flawed but very very funny.
","Wedding Crashers - Two men (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) crash weddings for food, parties and women. However their plans go awry when they both discover love in two sisters (Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher), one of them with a boyfriend, the other a freaky crazy girl. This movie has some very funny moments. Wilson and Vaughn make a good strong team. Not only were there numerous giggle points, but I had my head buried in my hands about 15 times throughout the movie in laughter. The dinner table scene easily tops that of the one in Meet the Parents.The movie could've set out to do more than the whole 'get the girl' scenario that has been done ad nauseum, but it's probably among the best attempts at the silly romantic/comedy. The violence isn't purely comedic. These tackles and punches really hurt and had me 'Oohhing' (and saying other things, but those are R rated) in commiseration. However, some of the silly scenes (like the Will Ferrell shtick) don't really fly, and it sticks out like a big ol' sore thumb, but it leads to one of the biggest 'OH MY GOD' moments in the movie.Some people that are more politically correct than I might have problems with certain characters in the film. Whatever I say. The problem for me was that the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long. It could've done with some editing. If you go for this sort of comedy, as I do, that you'll like it. If you don't, you'll still laugh and probably enjoy yourself. This gets a B+.",8,1,2,4 January 2006
Hancock," This film gave me a headache.
","Hancock - The streets of New York are simultaneously protected and suffer the excessive collateral damage done by Hancock (Will Smith), a none too nice and largely ineffective superhero. He saves the life of a similarly ineffective (though is not presented as so) personal relations agent named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who is so grateful that he dedicates his career to improving Hancock's image, despite the lack of any real fiscal benefits from doing so. But Embrey is one of those humanitarian P.R. reps you read so much about, whose pitch to the corporations always seems to involve them giving away their products for free. They unsurprisingly decide to do otherwise.The first thirty minutes or so of the film are decent enough. It's mildly amusing to watch a superhero that genuinely doesn't seem to give a crap about anything. Hancock causes a tremendous amount of collateral damage. But if he ultimately doesn't care about people, then why try and help at all? Hancock is supposed to be an 'asshole', but comes off as just morose. Smith's been playing that a lot lately and judging by the box office receipts, it's what people want. The film could explore why Hancock feels he owes anything at all to these people. It does not. Note to filmmakers: Never make a superhero without motivation.It's when Hancock voluntarily goes to jail that the film slants into place getting ready for a tremendous nose dive. It becomes boring (superhero sits around in jail = fun movie?) and changes from a comedy to a drama, a critical mistake partly because the writing of the second half is seriously lackluster. The other reason is the special effects are just not good enough for a dramatic film. They come off as cartoonish. Things disintegrate on impact far too easily like there was nothing holding them together in the first place. If Hancock has the mass and strength to stop a train without any recoil and makes craters on landings (inconsistently for comic purposes I suppose), then shouldn't the mere act of walking or running around cause mild earthquakes? I mentioned the second half of the film. It absolutely sucks. I was having a migraine trying to figure out what was going on with Charlize Theron's character, and her's and Hancock's back story in general. The whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense. There's just a series of fights for absolutely no reason other that to satisfy action junkies. This is the first and hopefully last time I ever see Jason Bateman take part in an action sequence. Hancock really felt rushed, I assume because the call of the July 4th box office. Money beats art any day of the week. The producers of Hancock know this, and Bateman's character should have known it too.Boring and rushed in appearance and execution, Hancock gets a D+",4,3,6,6 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes for the remake generation
","Sherlock Holmes - Based on the books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the popular detective is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. His loyal companion Watson (played superbly by Jude Law) is getting married and Holmes is none too happy. Their antics are put on the shelf because Lord Blackwood (ice cold Mark Strong), a powerful man of the occult world, has committed a series of murders. When he is hung, he rises from the grave and promises to drastically change the world with himself as master. With the future of several countries at stake, it is up to Holmes to stop Blackwood. Downey Jr. disappears into the role like the character does with various disguises. He is completely believable as a detective whose deductive skills are so powerful that, without focus, mundane situations are overwhelming to his psyche. The film and role are his.Holmes is portrayed as a borderline manic depressive eccentric who cannot function unless he has a goal to accomplish. In other words: Robert Downey Jr. The film has fun exploring the part of Holmes left untouched by the films done by varying Television productions for many years. Namely: the physical side of Holmes. Yes, Holmes is a boxer, stick/sword fighter, and a martial artist. It was in the books, and it is done in this film as well. He flung Moriarty down a chasm with jujitsu in one of the stories for God's sake! It always bothered me that Holmes's eccentricities and drug-use seemed to be shelved on the screen in favor of a more well-put together stern man who would never deign to get his hands dirty. Holmes was never meant to be a symbol of stiff-upper lip Britain, yet that's what he became. The obvious reasons behind these choices were probably finances (or lack thereof concerning fight co-ordination) and censorship. It's funny how interpretations work. Icons are taken down such a strange path that, when someone decides to bring them to where they started, the old looks new. Batman was always noir. Bond was a quipless suave killer. Holmes could fight. A down and dirty Holmes is more interesting (surprise!) to a 21st century audience than an omniscient uppercrust man eternally in a bathrobe. This Holmes is fairly true to the original character. It may not be true to the Holmes some people have in their heads, but that version cherry picks elements of Doyle's original creation. Actually this Watson is not as close to the original version (younger with no limp), but this Watson ties Holmes to reality, is less of an audience fill-in (read: a dumb shmoe) and kicks some major ass.The film is riveting with only a few parts that actually lag. Huge explanations are saved until the end. We realize we have seem more or less all that Holmes has seen, and yet he gleaned far far more with his powerful intellect. Guy Ritchie's directing is vast and yet detail oriented. It's fairly comprehensible yet there is enough in the dialogue and character relationships to warrant future viewings.Sherlock Holmes is smart and entertaining, a combination which always works better than either adjective by itself. This is an invigorating re-boot that reminds us why the detective is such an icon. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have perfect chemistry like an old married couple. Mark Strong plays a chilling villain and one lament is that, as part of the film is spent trying to find him, his performance is surprisingly brief. Rachel McAdams is the one part of casting that feels disingenuous. She's not quite devilish or sensuous enough to be the one woman that outsmarted Sherlock Holmes. Still, a thoroughly entertaining film for the head and heart. I look forward to the inevitable sequel. A-",9,138,216,25 December 2009
1408," Awesome cerebral scare-fest.
","1408 - Before it's lost in a deluge of cartoon rats (another film I'm eagerly awaiting), John McClane, and robots in disguise, I think you should all know about 1408. It's based off a Stephen King, and is LOADS better than all those TV movies that use his name for some reason.The film involves supernatural-yet-skeptic writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack, in a meaty role that suits his wonderful talent), who stays a night in room 1408 (1 + 4 + 0 + 8 = what?) at the Dolphin Hotel, despite being told no by Samuel L. Jackson over and over again. No one says no to Sam Jackson! That should be a new movie rule. They have a couple of good scenes together and then Cusack goes into the room, and there are enough 'holy *insert swearword here*' moments to more than satisfy any horror fan, myself included. There's very little gore and blood, but fans of those probably already went to see Hostel II. This movie is for people who like their scares cerebral. There's loads of creepy atmosphere and this is what last year's 'Silent Hill' endeavored to be.The movie starts up slow, then builds intensity as Cusack realizes what he's gotten himself into, but by then it's to late. It would be criminal to reveal too much, but the room basically toys with him and you mentally and physically for an hour. Cusack acts very well, as all hope slowly escapes him. He pretty much holds up the human spectrum of the film, but the Room is a marvelous creature. The film kind of lags a little at the end, as it's a concept movie, and nearly all concept movies crap out a little. But man, talk about a hidden gem among the granite! This is the scariest movie since last year's 'The Descent', and it's still at a mild PG-13. I'm not sure if it would hold up to repeat viewings, but a high B+",8,2,4,27 June 2007
Iron Man," Well made, well acted and never campy.
","Iron Man - Billionaire playboy/weapons designer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) suffers a mortal wound and has a change of heart (literally) after he is abducted by terrorists in Afghanistan. After seeing his own weapons used against him and innocents, Tony Stark creates several armor suits to escape his captors and become...Iron Man.Now this is what I'm talking about! This movie is badass. I would have to see it a few times over, but I think it may have a notch over Spiderman 2. This movie made me feel like a 13 year old, watching the Spiderman movie with glee. Origin stories are boring unless you do them right, but it is terribly fun to watch Tony Stark transform himself technically and mentally into Iron Man. And there are several (very well done) action scenes, but it never feels over the top or too much. They always leave you wanting more, which is a good thing. It's such a great feeling every time he puts on the suit.Robert Downey Jr. has done a commendable job. He is quirky, hilarious and entirely believable without ever stepping into the dangerous camp zone, as Marvel movies are prone to do. He has me believing that a man with more money than God and the coolest suit of armor ever could have problems. Everyone else turns in a good performance, and especially Jeff Bridges. I never got to see him do anything villainous before, but his performance as Obadiah Stane is quite chilling. Even Stan Lee's cameo is actually funny this time (I thought he left Marvel. huh.) Looking forward to Terrence Howard's extended part as War Machine, as he's kinda stinted in this one. It's mostly Robert Downey Jr.'s movie, and he sells it.I've never been much of an Iron Man fan (I do like the Ultimate Universe comics involving him though) and only saw Robert Dwoney Jr. in Zodiac prior to this. I'll have to watch his other film. He's fantastic. See the film whether you're an Iron Man fan or if you're not. If you read comics, if you don't. It's a very GOOD FILM regardless, and easily accessible. I can't wait to see it again. It'll almost make you believe a man can fly. Or that a billionaire would actually put his own life in jeopardy for the rest of mankind.btw, stick around for after the credits when you see it.A-",9,2,4,3 May 2008
Casino Royale," Dry martini? Give me a damn pint.
","Casino Royale Casino Royale - A modern version of the beginning of James Bond's career. Think of it as 'Batman Begins' to the James Bond movies. C'mon, it's not that difficult a concept to grasp. And if you still can't, there are still pretty explosions and people getting killed to distract you from thinking.The character has changed actors 6 times; he's become more of an archetype than a human. And that's where this film really shines. We see the transformation of a very skilled (and very flawed) James Bond in the rough and watch him evolve into the suave martini sipping agent that can do no wrong.Of course, this would still not be a very good film if not for a portrayal of James that's second only to Connery. Daniel Craig gives a superb performance. Through all the gadgets, cars and cheesy world domination plots we've lost the cold hard fact that James is ultimately an assassin that happens to be working for the good guys. He has a wicked sense of humor (and Craig really delivers those one-liners), a pension for violence and aggression, and does not give a damn for sophistication. He is given his first formal mission: foil a poker game that funds terrorism. Nothing ornate, and just as well. After the Goldfinger film I could not give you an in-depth account of any of the Bond film plots. They've always been a sidenote to the girls and the toys, but some solid scripting and plot work was done on Casino Royale.What I loved best was that Bond made mistakes. The man has not fully found himself in the work yet. He shot a hostage and blew up an embassy when tracking a bomb maker. His first kill is anything but suave. He does not always have an escape plan. And he has not yet learned the whole 'love them and leave them' thing that became a trademark of the series. My favorite scene may be when he comforts Bond-girl Vesper (Eva Green) in the shower (and no, not THAT way) after one particularly intense dispatchment of the bad guys.I could go on, but the gist of it is that if you've seen the other Bond films, you'll get great satisfaction out of this one. If you haven't (small chance) you'll still see one hell of an action/suspense movie. The fights and chase sequences are top-notch and the supporting cast is well played. Eva Green and Judi Dence both give fine performances, while Mads Mikkelsen under-acts his way through playing Bond villain Le Chiffre, to decent effect. But the real show is Daniel Craig.Craig haters, you can stuff your gripes even further up your asses. I give the film an A.",10,0,2,17 November 2006
Beowulf," Flat, cold take on a classic story.
","Beowulf - From the maker of Polar Express Roger Zemeckis and writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery (who I'm still sore at for sinking the Silent Hill movie), we have Beowulf, a hero archetype come to life, well sort of. Everyone is layered densely in CGI, and the film exploits the usual weaknesses and strengths of CGI. It's awesome when used to show sea monsters being slaughtered (highly reminiscent of the God of War video game, and if a movie is made of that too, this is likely the formula that will be used) in some fairly cool bloody ways, but just cannot show human emotion as well as the real thing.A monster Grendal (name inspires terror doesn't it?) whose sole power is being bat-s*** hideous (not scary, just really ugly) looking and sole-weakness is slightly stupider that that of the aliens in Signs, comes to town and wreaks havoc in an apparent desire to make the story interesting. Beowulf stops him relatively easily in a pretty cool fight scene, and the rest of the time we have to listen to some mildly boring dialog and some awkward character decisions. Best line? 'There have been many a brave soldier come to taste my husband's mead.' John Malkovich's character beats a cripple at least twice with a stick and repeating in a monotone that the boy is spilling mead, in a scene I'm pretty sure was meant to be comical but comes off as cruel. Why? I didn't really sympathize with anyone. It's too cold in this fantasy world. The CGI gimmick kinda worked against them there. Robin Wright Penn was pretty bland as both eye-candy and in acting. Anthony Hopkins fans should avoid this as his character is frankly embarrassing. Crispin Glover 'plays' Grendal the same way that Hugo Weaving did a voice-over for Megatron in the Transformers movie earlier this year; completely unrecognizable through a mask of effects to the point where anyone could've played the part. The only person well cast (typecast?) was Brendan Gleeson, as Beowulf's sidekick. Oh, and Angelina Jolie, as seduction itself in as close to a nude-scene as fanboys will get now that she's got all her kids going to see her films.It's got a cool bit with a dragon at the end, but what does it all really matter when I don't care about the characters? Beowulf has an interesting story and one or two decent action scenes, but is mostly forgettable. a C+",6,0,2,26 November 2007
300," Very fun, but no Sin City
","300 300 - A film adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, which was based on a movie 'The 300 Spartans' that was based on the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.Or to put it more simply, a bunch of guys with swords and spears go up against the big bad Persians. You either like this sort of thing or you don't. I do. My friends didn't, but they're a hard bunch to please (and lord, oh lord I know I'll get comments from them on this).Gerard Butler stars and almost makes up for his turn as the Phantom in that Schumacher movie. He reminded me a little of Sean Connery, not just because of the same Scotsman accent (was there a genuine Greek in the cast?) , but also because of the same dry quip delivery, but with plenty of malice to go along. Lena Headey (funny last name) is the only important member of the cast without a Y chromosome. She's a good actress, but the lengthening of her part means a small sub-story that doesn't quite work, but does break up the fights a bit. And it wouldn't be an epic battle movie without a cast member from Lord of the Rings there (Orlando Bloom isn't to be found, strangely). David Wenhem, who played Faramir, is here as narrator and soldier, and sound support.My only major complaint is the guy they got to play Xerxes. I tried to wrap my head around him, but it just DID NOT WORK. Yes, he's the big bad guy. That doesn't mean the big bad guy has to sound like Darth Vader with the bass amped up. It's just doesn't work when linked up with the black guy (who's not black in real life, funny enough) who's covered in jewelry and too much eye make-up. yeesh. it was meant to be other-worldly, it just came off as bad.Plenty of naked women, though strangely for Gracean times they're all 0-sized models. Plenty of sweet sweet fight scenes, and really, that's what we're there for, right? And damn, are these fights gory, but I never felt it was gratuitous. There are those oh so great one-liners that Frank Milelr is well-known for. There are some monsters, to which my friends commented that it felt like Lord of the Rings over again. I will admit that yes, 300 is not the freshest kid on the block, but it is very pretty, very bloody, and very very fun.A solidly fun swords and shields movie, 300 gets a B+",7,1,9,9 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Not bad, but not *Fantastic*
","Fantastic Four - Five scientists go into space for some reason and get bombarded with gamma rays or something. I'd go into more depth, but the Fantastics weren't my favorites in the Marvel universe. First Off, I enjoyed The Thing (Micheal Chiklis)'s acting as he goes through the trials and tribulations of being covered in Kaptain Krunch cereal and being unable to hold a drink (could he get a straw or something?). I also liked Ioan Gruffudd's Mr. Fantastic character, and wish he was given more to do. Finally I liked Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom, even if it was mostly a psychotic super-powered rehash of his character on Nip/Tuck. That's not necessarily a bad thing. His sparingly used evil scenes were fun. As for the other two, Chris Evans was mostly really annoying at first, but he's grown on me. Jessica Alba was really whiny. She needs acting lessons, as there was little to nothing endearing about her character.Sidenote: The film's idea of keeping the team away from everyone and trying to undo their condition was kinda boring. The only time anything interesting really happened was when they left their H.Q.Some of the effects are better than others. Some of the Mr. Fantastic effects look like they were done on the cheap. Same goes for the Invisible Woman force fields. Maybe they can fix that in the sequel.The movie doesn't have a real story per se. It has moments and one liners. While that's not a terrible thing (The Thing threateningly telling kids not to do drugs was buckets of fun by itself), it keeps the movie from being anything other than adequate and being in the league of such comic book films as Spiderman, Superman, and Batman Begins. It is, however, in the league of fun no-brainer comic book films like Daredevil, The Punisher, and Darkman.Fun but hardly Fantastic, Fantastic gets a B-",7,1,2,10 September 2006
Pineapple Express," Very funny. I'll probably buy the DVD.
","Pineapple Express - When Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) witnesses a murder, he and his drug dealer Saul (James Franco) go on the run from thugs and crooked policemen.I enjoyed this movie. It kept the general atmosphere throughout and it never felt like there was an inappropriate break in the mood. It's a silly comedy with some sharp writing and some fighting scenes that manage to be funny and awesome all in one. It seemed reminiscent of Shaun of the Dead in that the main characters are normal guys who are thrown into an action movie. It's silly, but few of the characters seem very disconnected from reality.I know Judd Apatow is gonna steal the credit for this one (he produced and helped write the story), but his director friend David Gordon Green did a good job. Seth Rogen keeps playing his funny character (It's nice in the 2000s that the leading man can be funny in comedies now) from Knocked Up and 40 Year Old Virgin and that's a-OK for me. James Franco is great in a role that could have been terribly terribly annoying in someone else's shoes.So all in all, a funny movie about weed and...funny things you do and say under the influence of it. It's refreshing to see a comedy without a 'grow up' moral tied on. Because I don't know about you, but I go to comedies to laugh, not learn morals from them. The last 25 minutes have some violence (the movie was not looking for that 21-50 female demographic), but none of it disrupted the feel of the movie. I liked Pineapple Express better than Knocked Up and will probably buy the DVD.In conclusion, Pineapple Express gets a B+",8,4,8,7 August 2008
Sin City," A must-see for comic-book fans
","Sin City - A series of largely unconnected vignettes and directed by Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, Sin City just drips from comic book atmosphere and style. Be it the fact that everything is in various stages of chrome (and anything the directors felt you should pay attention to, such as blood, is overly colored), or that everyone smokes, or that there is more narration than actual dialog. The characters make most of the movie, rather than the plots, which are not that important. There's Harigan (Bruce Willis), the hard-as-adamantium-nails cop with a heart of gold for Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), as he takes on The Yellow B@stard (Nick Stahl). There's Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is pretty much invulnerable to pain, and kills with a warm smile and fun disposition. These two vigilantes, through their glorious comic book violence, make The Punisher look like a cream puff. There's also Dwight (Clive Owen), who similarly never seems to go down, and is very fast with his dual pistols. Oh, and I shouldn't even have to mention the super scary, super agile Kevin (Elijah Wood). You will remember him. There's more unique characters, but it'd take all day to describe them. The fight scenes are bloody and just plain jaw dropping fun, if you like that sort of thing. I do. There are some minor down points, mostly pacing. once or twice. The movie is kinda long near the end. And if you didn't like either of the Kill Bills for violence than you should stay the heck away from this. But to everyone else, you deny yourselves a treat by ignoring this film. A.",10,3,4,19 June 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Good little movie.
","Slumdog Millionaire - A former street child Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) from Mumbai is arrested and questioned for knowing all of the answers on an Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' He explains, in flashbacks, his past and how he has come to know all the answers to the questions. The film is shot and diced up with three time lines: Jamal's childhood, his experience on the show, and his recounting of both to the police. It's a cool novel way to tell a story that is essentially a love story between Jamal and Latika (Frieda Pinto)The first half of the film is gritty, urban and akin to realism in aesthetics. The rundown lived in qualities of India are rich and very human. I enjoyed them in Salaam Bombay and I liked them here. It's very pleasant to see India's culture unadulterated. India is beautiful and beautifully shot. I expect this film will get many props for Cinematography. The soundtrack is also very good, with many catchy easy-to-groove-to songs. The performances are all top notch. It's a sweet little journey Jamal and his big brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) are on. They commit all sorts of trickery and get into much hi-jinx to survive. It's the main contrivance of the plot (the catch) that is irritating, and leads to the pulpy fluff of the second half. Nearly EVERY question asked on the show pertains to this young man's life in some key way? He didn't study at all? I just have to roll my eyes, and did several times. Many of the questions are also dead easy in addition to corresponding far too easily with Jamal's past. It's less a tale of a poor man making it to fame and riches with his own abilities than being carried there by the movie gods.In the end, we have a rather good movie that should not be held up to the hype surrounding it. This happened for me with Babel a few years ago. It's a shame we have awards and award campaigning to cloud our judgments on films. This will probably be held up as better than it is by people looking for hope in our current depression.

Marge nags as per usual and sounds closer to Patty or Selma than her original voice.

Lisa, almost no one's favorite character, actually gets some great moments and she finds a cute Irish boyfriend.Tom Hanks has two funny bits on the film, and Al Brooks is underused.Now, any true Simpsons fan probably stopped watching about 7 years ago, as the show's last best memorable episode was probably 'Behind the Laughter'. The film gets a better sharper aesthetic that is a little more reminiscent of the show's golden years. Think of it as Revenge of the Sith to the original Star Wars trilogy. Hardly stellar, but a breath of fresh air compared to the recent garbage.The film strikes at brilliance once or twice, keeps the laughs coming generally, and I'm sure everyone will be singing 'Spider Pig' to the point of tedium by the end of the summer. The film kind of runs out of steam halfway through, but picks it up by the end.Sidenote: Subtly making the EPA the villain of the movie just put a bad taste in my mouth, a reminder that FOX controls the strings of The Simpsons.This was a solid movie but I can't in good conscience support what means God knows how many more unnecessary Simpsons seasons. It's funny, but please FOX, for the love of God, STOP. The cow is milked.B.",7,3,5,29 July 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Banal and shallow
","Why did this, of all movies, survive for over sixty years? I'm thinking it had something to do with America's fascination with midgets. The Lion was the only good character. Everyone is shallowly scripted. We know the good people are good because they're white, always merry and rosy cheeked. We know the bad people are bad because they are gray (or green)and black colored. The songs are boring. The lessons are commonplace; similar to what you could read in a fortune cookie. The biggest rip-off of all was that Glinda just toyed with Dortothy all along. She could've left Oz anytime. ripoff. Has Dorothy learned anything from this? There's no place like home. yay. The only good thing about this movie is that it lead to Wicked.",4,11,60,17 October 2005
V for Vendetta," To call this 'fiction' would be an injustice.
","V for Vendetta - World War III has come and gone, and the mistakes of the past have come 'round full circle. The people of Great Britain, in fear of the plague and chaos that resulted in the 'States', have handed their rights away to the church, and a Hitler-esquire ruler (John Hurt) for protection. But not all hope is lost, for an anarchist has come to save us from ourselves. His name is V (Hugo Weaving) and he has not forgotten 'freedom' and it is not just a word to him.This is an excellent movie. It hits hard the problems of today. As we find ourselves being robbed of our civil liberties by a pack of sniveling fear-mongers. As we find ourselves in a world where our religion has quickly become the only thing that matters, and crimes committed by those that claim to be heads of religion are allowed to get away with horrid crimes. As we find that the line between 'hero' and 'villain' is quite easy to cross, if it exists at all.Hugo Weaving deserves an Oscar nomination at least. He won't get it, but someones got to admit that it's pretty damn hard to act and show emotion and charisma inside a mask. He is a formidable presence as the charming and devilish anarchist V. Natalie Portman isn't quite as good, but she's still very convincing as the vulnerable, but not too vulnerable Evey.As one of my earlier comments might have indicated, I was grimly satisfied at the inclusion of a pedophile priest. SOMEONE had to include it in a movie sometime.The effects are spectacular and the dialog is too. I enjoyed the brutal hard hitting fight sequences quite a bit.It will be snubbed all around, but V for Vendetta is an amazing movie with numerous references to our own situation with George W. Bush, the 1930s syphilis testings, the the Nazi rise to power and the Holocaust (all four of which could occur over and over again).Who knew one of the most important messages could come in a comic book movie? V for Vendetta gets an A.",10,4,9,18 March 2006
