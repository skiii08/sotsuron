First Man," Could do better
","The movie would have been very good if there was more sequences like the first 10 minutes (the X-15 flight).
This sequence is one of the best sequences in the cinema, ever.
It makes us feel like that those guys who were in metal boxes at Mach 3.5, at the limit of the sky, with many chances not to come back alive. They were scared and still living an experience not many would ever live.
Rest of the movie is more than average : it's 2 hours of Golsing's feelingless face (as much as charism as Keanu Reeves).
And the Apollo 11 (final sequence) is botched: go to the moon, land, walk a bit, go home.",7,0,0,29 October 2018
