Captain Phillips," Power from unobvious
",I went to watch a movie after a very long time to a theater today. The movie was 'Captain Phillips' which is one of the greatest movies I would love to see wining Oscars this year.Tom Hanks is at his best giving full virtual voyage to the audience to feel being actually captured by Pirates. There is not a single point where you would get left behind the action and movie evolves with the time to its peak. It's a movie which would put adrenal to your nerves and I insist not to watch it at home.One can actually see how management could be done where as you have absolute zero control or influence towards others and get the 'Power from unobvious'. It's all about psychology which plays the lead role either you live a normal routine life or life forces you to be unobvious.,10,2,5,19 October 2013
