The Blair Witch Project," The scariest movie of all time.
","The Blair Witch Project has to be one of the terrifying movies I've ever seen. I've got it on DVD and watched it a thousand times, and I still think it's a good horror movie. When it first came on Sky Movies in the UK (the very first time I watched it), I knew it was gonna be a spine-chilling movie. It's true that some people in the UK didn't find it scary, but it's also true that some other people found it really scary. Including me, of course. I just couldn't believe that it was all set in a large forest with three youngsters running around getting scared saying 'Look. Pile of rocks' and 'Oh, my God! Who put those stick men up the trees?!'. After watching the movie, I was scared to think that it was real. But when my brother told me it wasn't, I was relieved. Now, here's an advice. When you go and have a walk in a wood or forest, just remember, there's no such thing as the Blair Witch.",8,1,4,16 June 2006
