Casablanca," A women needs her ex lovers help to escape from Germany
","The movie was shot in black and white and mostly took place in a night club. The lighting made good use of shadows to make it actually look and feel like a crowded, smoky night club. The film's lead (Humphrey Bogart) does an incredible job of playing a kind of mysterious, hard to crack his shell, kind of protagonist. However, I feel the films hype may have lessened the impact of it for me. I liked it and enjoyed myself overall, however, I found myself bored at times as it was mostly the same location. Something about stagnancy of location makes the plot also feel stagnant to me as well. Though, like I said, still an awesome plot and great performances all around.",7,0,2,9 March 2016
Annie Hall," Explores a comedian and his relationship with a girl
","I really enjoyed this movie, although I must say, I felt slightly disappointed. I think it is likely because the comedy community hypes Woody Allen to the point of unrealistic expectations. There were some instances of humor I didn't enjoy, certain one liners seemed somewhat dated and corny for example. However, there is another side to the movie's humor...Allen seems to write a kind of depressed nihilism into the character that I found amusing. It perfectly represents the personality of most comedians. A need to turn to jokes because of their miserable outlook. But there is a part of all of us that can relate to this.",8,0,0,13 May 2016
Singin' in the Rain," A story about the making of musicals in the 1920's
","This movie serves as a kind of meta commentary...as it is a musical about the making of a musical. The film seems to poke fun at the desperation of the movie industry in the 20's to put out sound films, just to please audiences. The soundtrack for this movie is fantastic. I can honestly say I've never heard the entire title track 'Singing in the Rain' until watching the whole film and it was stuck in my head for weeks. All of the musical scenes were well choreographed, looked great in color, and were extremely well voiced by the actors and actresses. The cast was largely multi talented and created a great musical in the process of making fun of a bad one.",9,1,2,13 May 2016
