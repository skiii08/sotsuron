The Perks of Being a Wallflower," If you read the book you'll understand
","well, the movie is pretty good but for me personally the book was better, they took out some important things. *SPOILERRRRR.* for example i believe in the book his sister get pregnant, the boyfriend leaves her, she tells him it was a false alarm and he wants to get back together. in the movies that never happens which for me was a point in the book where Charlie and his sister really got along which was important to me. same for everything with his family, it wasn't in the movie and just little things just like that. if you haven't read the book have fun, but if you have then it's probably just like a regular book to movie adaptation.",7,0,0,2 December 2013
