The Sound of Music," Lovely
","I remember the first time I ever saw this movie. I was about ten, an avid Julie Andrews fan even at such an early age. (I still am, Long Live Dame Jools!) My aunt picked up this movie for me, but I didn't know that Julie was in it. Imagine my surprise when I popped it in the VCR and there's Julie, dancing and singing on those lovely Austrian Alps (by the way, the exterior shots WERE filmed in Austria). I screamed with glee and my grandmother came running, thinking I had hurt myself or something... anyway...What can I say but that I love this show? Julie is so excellent, and the children are charming, and even Chris Plummer seems to be a nice guy. The story, based on the true story of the Von Trapp Family Singers, strays a lot from the real Mrs. Von Trapps telling, but it is still charming none the less. And Julie shines, shines, shines! The songs never fail to bring a smile to my face. The emotions in this film, how you root for Maria and how you wonder if the Nazies will discover there escape, etc, etc... charming.
Maybe not the deepest film, or the most poignant, and it certainly won't attact for sex, blood, guts or gore... but it is a signiture classic from the golden years of musicals... when Hollywood still had some poise.I love it!",Null,0,6,9 April 2003
