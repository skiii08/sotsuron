Requiem for a Dream," awful
","Oh my God, this is one of the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I usually am a very impatient person, but while I was watching this movie, I've had a lot of patience. I was thinking that the end would be something unexpected, but it was such a big waste of time, AND BELIEVE ME.. I HATE WASTING MY TIME. I don't usually write a review, but because of this failure I have to. Such an ordinary, mediocre and embarrassing movie. The plot of the movie was awful, and again..AWFUL. The actors didn't act like they're supposed to act. Oh, and I saw that the movie was based on a story of a book, and I have to tell that the author of this book is dumb.",1,10,21,26 September 2015
