Your Name.," Amazing animation, touching story
","Pure Japanese magic. The effort and skill that has been put into this anime is astounding. The story, too, is a beautiful one. Deservingly, 'Your Name' (Kimi no na wa) (2016) became the fourth highest-grossing film of all time in Japan and the highest-grossing anime film worldwide. It's one of those rare little movie treasures that actually gets the attention and reaches the audience it deserves.",8,4,7,1 May 2017
Ghost," Hasn't aged well
","It sure has that feeling of an American 90's movie and it's a bit fun seeing Swayze, Moore and Goldberg, but the movie isn't very good.The best thing about 'Ghost' is the pleasant and enjoyable score by Maurice Jarre. Today, it is hard to believe the success of this movie. It grossed over $505.7 million at the box office on a budget of $22 million and it was the highest-grossing film of 1990. Adjusted for inflation, as of 2015, 'Ghost' was the 93rd-highest-grossing film of all time domestically in the US. Furthermore, the film was nominated for five Academy Awards and won the awards for Best Supporting Actress for Goldberg and Best Original Screenplay. Swayze and Moore both received Golden Globe Award nominations for their performances, while Goldberg won the BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Saturn Awards in addition to the Oscar.While the acting certainly isn't bad, it's not impressive either. What's really strange is the Academy Award for the screenplay, because it really isn't a strong one. I think it's safe to say this movie has aged quite badly.",5,4,11,31 May 2017
It," Better as an adventure than as horror
","For once, Hollywood delivers a remake with heart and inspiration - and good screen writing. Bill Skarsgård is truly frightening as Pennywise.Director Andy Muschietti and his team have created that magical Spielberg-Zemeckis adventurous 80s feeling, also reminding of King-based 'Stand by Me' (1986). The fine performances by the young cast, the quick, funny and good writing, the nice score by rising Benjamin Wallfisch and the cinematography by skilled South Korean Chung Chung- hoon (frequent collaborator of Park Chan-wook) all help in making 'It' a well-working and enjoyable film.",7,2,3,21 October 2017
The Great Dictator," Impressive, humorous depiction of tragic events
","Charles Chaplin was one of the first and one of the greatest actors directing himself. 'The Great Dictator', which he also wrote, premiered in 1940 while Hitler was growing stronger and stronger in Europe. Looking back, it's hard to imagine a movie more current. Not surprisingly, it was banned in Germany until 1958. The speech in the end of movie has, rightly so, long since reached a level of immortality.",7,1,3,18 April 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Scaled-down, truly witty and surprisingly fresh
","It may seem greedy and a bit stupid doing another Spider-Man reboot so short after the last one, but Homecoming brings something fresh.Talented Tom Holland is an amazing asset to the movie. His charisma and comic timing balances this new Spider-Man flick in way that both makes you care more about what happens in the movie and, more importantly, brings a well-needed break from the somewhat mechanic action of the Avengers and Captain America movies. It's a bold move letting young and rather inexperienced feature film director Jon Watts ('Clown', 'Cop Car') direct a blockbuster of these proportions. Usually, this is done in order to make it easier for the producers and the studio to control the production, but here, clearly, we're given the vision of a director and not the formulaic mess the studios sometimes forces through. Last but not least, kudos to composer maestro Michael Giacchino, who's created what is probably the strongest Marvel score this far.",8,110,215,5 July 2017
Capote," Amazing lead-performance
","Considering the fact that 'Capote' was director Bennett Miller's first non-documentary feature film, it's acclaim certainly is impressive. What's even more impressive is Philip Seymour Hoffman's lovely performance (God bless him in movie heaven).",7,0,0,17 February 2019
Baby Driver," Lacking the humour it would have needed
","It sounds like the perfect action crime movie for Edgar Wright, but 'Baby Driver' doesn't hold all way through, despite a strong opening.In 2004, director Wright gave us the brilliant zombie comedy 'Shaun of the Dead.' Then came another successful comedy, 'Hot Fuzz.' Now watching his latest pic, I couldn't help wishing it too would have been an Edgar Wright comedy, rather than yet another heist/car chase/action movie. It does, of course, try to bring something new and Ansel Elgort is terrific, and charming, in the leading role. That's not enough, however, to carry the film through the 112 minutes of running time.",5,6,14,28 July 2017
The Battle of Algiers," Powerful depiction of historical events
","With the Italian-Algerian film 'The Battle of Algiers' from 1966, Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo managed to create a timeless classic and a great depiction of a long and fierce conflict between the French colonial power and the Arab population in the city of Algiers. Shot in an Italian neorealism style and with a documentary-type editing and effective black-and-white photography, the film has all the aesthetics to give to viewer the feeling of being there, in the centre of actions, showing that both of the parts of the conflict were guilty of awful crimes.",8,2,4,1 May 2017
Dunkirk," Emotional and technical brilliance
","Thank you, Nolan, for being the saviour of my blockbuster movie summer. Your vision and creativity is unique in productions of this scale.When, a few years ago, I heard that the next Christopher Nolan pic would be one about WWII, I must admit feeling a bit disappointed. I wasn't quite sure there would still be something new to bring the genre. From the first few seconds of 'Dunkirk,' I gathered I'd been wrong to doubt. During the 107 minutes of running time, I was glued to screen. Nolan and his cast and crew delivers one of the tightest war thrillers ever to screened to this date. The airplane scenes alone are absolutely amazing. With sound design, sound editing, film editing, practical and visual effects, cinematography and a score like this, it will take, in fairness, a helluva movie to prove more worthy of associated Academy Awards.",9,7,15,28 July 2017
The Favourite," Amazing
",Pros: Lanthimos' continous ingenuity. Colman = AMAZING. Weisz and Stone = great! Davis' and McNamara's brilliant writing. Ryan's gorgeous cinematography. The dashing production and costume design. Cons: Halted a tad towards the end.,9,2,4,24 March 2019
JFK," Well-written and well-acted
","Oliver Stone is well known for his political filmmaking. Whatever your opinion of the American government, the assassination of John F Kennedy and the war lobbying, 'JFK' is an fine example of great acting by Costner and impeccable screen writing, in a highly engaging movie. It is thrilling enough to keep you watching through the 189 minutes.",8,2,4,16 April 2017
Gone Girl," Superb in manys ways
","Wow! What a first-rate production: Fincher again showing his insane directorial skills. Gillian Flynn's impressive writing. Cronenweth's photo. Kirk Baxter's editing. The acting from Affleck (great), Pike (phenomenal) and Carrie Coon (incredible).",8,2,3,25 August 2018
Get Out," Skillfully balancing between comedy and horror
","Debuting director Jordan Peele knows how to handle his budget. Universal Pictures, who were smart enough to pick up the movie for distribution, can be quite pleased with the turnout: with $4.5 million in production budget, the movie has already returned $204,3 million (and it's still counting) at the box office worldwide. One thing is for sure: director Peele knows how to balance between the swamp of horror clichés and a sketchy, almost over-the-top humour (reminding to some extent of Edgar Wright), but he also gives his comedy horror another dimension by playing with the conventions of whites-and-blacks relations.",8,11,20,8 May 2017
22 Jump Street," Too long, too little substance
","There are a lot of week spots here, sadly. It's clear that '22 Jump Street' doesn't take itself seriously, but that doesn't make it funny.It's hard doing good a comedy. It takes good writing, timing and spot-on dialogue, none of which is present here. The film would have benefited from a shorter running time, and should perhaps have ended after the first arrestment. There's simply not enough material for the running time it has. Hill and Tatum have a few nice moments, but it's not enough and their chemistry is not very strong.",4,1,2,11 June 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Pirates of No Inspiration, or How a Shitload of Awful CGI Can Destroy a Movie
","I'm quite sure Walt Disney would cry to see his name in this.Like the other three sequels, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' is made by the motto More Is More, which, apparently, is still not the case. Having watched, and loved, 'Kon-Tiki' and 'Max Manus' -- two impressively well-made productions by talented Norwegian directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg -- I must admit that I couldn't help hoping that I would once again get to experience the wonder and magic of 'The Curse of the Black Pearl.' Regrettably, though, there is nothing of that to be found here, as the latest installment of the series is completely devoid of story and inspiration and even, at most times, fails with the so-important humour. Bardem and Depp, both at times great actors, brings no real energy to their characters, and despite a few glimpses of light, I walked out from the cinema feeling that for 129 minutes, I'd been watching a movie on autopilot. One of the few things preventing this from being an unbearable experience was the music, which of course relies heavily on the works of Zimmer/Badelt from before, but also adds some nice new touches from composer Geoff Zanelli.",4,6,14,29 May 2017
Pawn Sacrifice," Great acting, interesting story
","Tobey Maguire is a very fine actor. Regrettably, he is not cast very frequently and since the failure of 'Spider-Man 3' in 2007, his fans have not seen very much of him. With 'Pawn Sacrifice', however, he once again showed his talent, depicting American chess genius and grandmaster Bobby Fischer from his childhood years up to the famous World Chess Championship in Reykjavík, Iceland in 1972. Co-starring Liev Schreiber, Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg, the film has no lack of good acting.",8,6,7,1 May 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Stands the pressure
",There is life in the Star Wars saga still. Writer-director Rian Johnson brings a somewhat more nuanced depiction of the forces of good and evil and there's an interesting dynamic between the characters of Rey and Kylo Ren. And Adam Driver - wow!,7,4,29,13 December 2017
From Dusk Till Dawn," Not the usual high quality of Tarantino screen-writing
","I didn't think I would ever say this, but with 'From Dusk Till Dawn', Quentin Tarantino, usually a skilled screenwriter and a masterful creator of dialogue, failed in his writing. The film is not really bad, but the genius of Tarantino is lacking. There's no real wit, no excitement, the dialogues are flat and uninspired and you don't really care about the characters. Apart from the first few minutes at the liquor store in the very beginning of the movie, the only real enjoyment was some impressive creature design and a stellar performance by Juliette Lewis, terrific as always. This picture was not so #7thArt.",5,0,1,1 May 2017
World Trade Center," Powerful but not quite as much as it could have
","Although not reaching all way through, Oliver Stone and the actors deliver enough tension and drama to make the film worth its 129 minutes.The pros: The acting by Cage, Peña, Bello and Gyllenhaal. The feeling of authenticity in the scenes under the collapsed buildings. The storytelling power and potential of the events. The cons: The fact that despite the power of the story and fine performances, the movie never reaches the heights it could have.",7,1,2,23 July 2017
Midsommar," Ari Aster, wow.
","Once again, writer-director Ari Aster blows my mind. The effort and love he and his team has put into this is nothing short of amazing. The production design by Svensson, cinematography by Pogorzelski and score by Krlic are all astonishing.",8,1,5,16 July 2019
Sinister," Above-average horror
","Although there are a few too many & too familiar genre traits in the film, it manages to engage enough too make you scared, thanks mostly to Hawke, about whom you care. Writer-director Derrickson's 4th full feature is an above-average horror.",6,0,0,14 January 2019
Don't Breathe," Suspense and never-ending entrapment
","‪With a strong performance by Stephen Lang as the gruesome Blind Man, the atmospheric Detroit setting, an inventive scenario and never-ending entrapment, director Fede Alvarez' second feature film manages to maintain a high level of suspense all the way.‬//Mårten Larsson. Facebookpage: 7th Art Short Reviews (@7thArtShortRevs).",7,1,2,18 November 2017
Jack Reacher," Generic and uninspired
","Cruise delivers yet another Ethan Hunt-like hero, who's smart and quick and capable of dealing with everything. Sadly, the movie's not good.The pros: Cruise is Cruise. He's agile, never gives up and always has an answer. The cons: The film's generic, uninspired and not very engaging. The writing and direction by Christopher McQuarrie leaves me wondering how the heck he pulled of much-better 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' (2015).",5,0,0,28 October 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Gunn delivers a solid sequel
","Thanks to the skills of writer-director James Gunn, this sequel manages to do what most sequels don't: it succeeds in keeping all the good parts of the first film while adding some new ones, always using the self-irony and humour in the right way to protect itself from falling into the trap of the now over-used and worn-out traditional Marvel movie formula. Together with 'Logan' (2017), the 'Guardians...' movies are now, more or less, all that helps me from losing my faith entirely in the once-great Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8,2,9,1 May 2017
The Shape of Water," Wonderful, beautiful, funny
","28th STOCKHOLM INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL. DAY 1, NOV 8th 2017. Nordic premiere of 'The Shape of Water' (2017).‪Balancing humour and drama impressively, the film contains some fine screen writing and an awe-inspiring performance by great Sally Hawkins.‬‪When writer-director Guillermo del Toro returns with his tenth feature, he delivers another amazing fantasy-drama filled with that deep love for movie-making and the oddities of life that very few other Hollywood directors can match. This is beauty in frames.‬",8,32,61,11 November 2017
The Disaster Artist," Entertaining, crazy
",James Franco again shows that he's not only a good actor but a talented director as well. This hilarious story is filled with warmth and love. The screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber is strong enough to give some nuance.,7,0,0,11 March 2019
Wonder Woman," Power and grace in yet another formula-made movie
","When finally it arrives, 'Wonder Woman' delivers all the power you could wish for. Gal Gadot really shows impressive dedication to the role.Director Patty Jenkins, who directed Charlize Theron in her legendary depiction of Aileen Wuornos in 'Monster' (2003), was offered to helm this historic screen adaptation, despite only having one feature film on her résumé. Apart from some faltering CGI (which, regrettably, seems to have become a standard in blockbusters of late, despite the technical powers at display), there cannot be much negative to say about the craftsmanship. Jenkins and her actors (David Thewlis, not the least) do what they are supposed to. The design is impressive. Rupert Gregson-Williams score is a mighty one. All in all, it's a nice ride. If only we'd not seen the formula used a million times before.",7,2,6,27 June 2017
Mother!," An allegory of Biblical proportions
","Long-awaited 'Mother!' is a challenging film. It's far more complicated and rich than the house-invasion horror-thriller it starts out as.Despite having directed only seven feature films, Darren Aronofsky has become one of the most interesting and important directors of our time. Now returning after a shot at Biblical adventure-drama 'Noah' (2014), Aronofsky delivers a film full of allegoric storytelling. The performances of Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are impressive. Aronofsky's screen writing and direction never allows the viewer to get away from the hellish nightmare that unrolls. Longtime Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique (who's worked with Aronofsky on six out of his seven full-features) delivers some exquisite cinematography that adds power and discomfort to the story. Having considered the movie after watching it, I've reached the conclusion that I need to watch again, as there's too much substance, and too much references, for me to grasp at a first viewing.",7,3,7,28 October 2017
Blade Runner," Technically impressive but not emotionally engaging enough
","A milestone in sci-fi film history, Scott's 'Blade Runner' (1982) has aged well, but it is technically impressive rather than heartfelt.The now-classic music by Vangelis competes with the great production design by Lawrence G. Paull, art direction by David L. Snyder and costume design by Michael Kaplan and Charles Knode about the title of most memorable feature of this production. However, the writing doesn't reach the same level and the film never lets the viewer close enough to really care what happens.",8,1,2,10 October 2017
Godzilla," Nice blend of Japanese and American setting
","With his first feature film 'Monsters' (2010), director Gareth Edwards showed a level of ingenuity and creativity that reached far beyond the Hollywood standards. His next project, Godzilla (2014), gave him a budget of $ 160 million. Hollywood had tried before to make its own version of the classic gigantic Japanese movie monster, but failed. Thankfully, Edwards does a lot better than Roland Emmerich did in 1998, creating a Gojira that the audience can care for, becoming the saviour of humanity rather than just a destructive force.",6,1,1,19 April 2017
Sully," A tribute to professionalism
","An emotionally engaging tribute to professionalism and, at times, a working satire on the sensationalism of media, it's rather a fine movie.It's fascinating to see how Clint Eastwood, at 86 years of age, is still able to direct good movies on interesting and relevant topics. Looking back at his work as a director for the last 15 years, it's hard not to be impressed. 'Sully' benefits greatly from the amazing and inspiring story of the Miracle on the Hudson, but it's Tom Hanks that really makes the film work.",7,0,0,3 June 2017
Alien: Covenant," Old and new
","Although responsible for some disappointments of late, director Scott has shown that he knows how to skillfully handle space as a setting.When returning with his third Alien installment, Scott does so by nicely blending 'Alien' (1979) with 'Prometheus' (2012), utilising some of the slow-building scares and atmosphere from the first one and adding the mythology and the references to classic art from the second. With love and respect for the franchise, Scott and his team use their creativity to make the film bring something new to the universe while still being a fitting piece to the puzzle. Although still far from the magic and mastery of the 1979 original, this sixth Alien film is a most well-crafted production, much thanks to the great work of production designer Chris Seagers, composer Jed Kurzel, cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, screenwriters John Logan and Dante Harper, helmer Scott -- and, of course, actors Katherine Waterston and impressive Michael Fassbender.",8,29,56,25 May 2017
The Godfather," Brilliant
","Yesterday, I was lucky to be able to watch 175 minutes of pure movie magic, restored and at a big screen, thanks to Cnema in Norrköping.The pros: The incredible attention to detail in this impressively well-written and directed film. The iconic characters and intrigues that have since been the model for so many mafia movies. The brilliant acting from great Marlon Brando. The music by composer Nino Rota that is now almost more famous than the movie itself. The cons: Marlon Brando is dead and Francis Ford Coppola haven't reached this level of mastery again since 'Apocalypse Now' in 1979.",10,1,1,27 September 2017
