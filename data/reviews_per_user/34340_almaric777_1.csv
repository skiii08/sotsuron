Hereditary," Beware of Satan's Treehouse
","First part is way too dark and depressing - emotionally gut-wrenching with added 'horror' bits to make it even worse.
The mystery/supernatural middle is intriguing. The actress who plays Annie is awesome here , but I strangely found alot of her scenes is this part to be humorous for some reason.
The last part attempts to ramp up the horror, but falls short. Candles, weird imagery and wall-crawling fails to impress.
The end is laughable as the film goes for full-on cult status.
Well-made and the performances are good, but not recommended.
