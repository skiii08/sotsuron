Ford v Ferrari," First time I have left a Cinema...
","Well at thirty years of age this was the first time my partner and I had ever walked out of a cinema before the movie had finished...As a petrolhead I should have loved this film. I know the story, I have seen the documentaries, I have watched the old films. An actor I had been working with mentioned it to me a year previously as he had landed a supporting role, I was excited by the prospect of a new film for motorsport fans such as myself. After seeing the trailer I remained excited, and yet slightly nervous about the handling of it.After the first twenty minutes I turned to my fiance and stated 'this had better improve'....after 45 minutes, I was ready to leave. We stayed for an hour as we had bought drinks and hoped things would improve. But there was simply no way I was going to make it through the full runtime of this movie.The writing and direction is just so cliche and cheesy, it wreaks of hamfisted Americanism, how people are claiming this will be up for awards is beyond me. It could have been written by a high school drama student. There were moments that were pure cringeworthy.I am deeply disappointed by this movie, I expected far more from everybody involved. Visually it's okay to look at, as it has the budget of a Hollywood Blockbuster. But beyond that, you'll be watching much of it through gritted teeth.",1,54,122,28 December 2019
