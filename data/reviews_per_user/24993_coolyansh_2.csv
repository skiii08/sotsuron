Requiem for a Dream," Leaves you disturbed for days
","This is one of those movies which leaves a deep impact on your mind even weeks after you have watched the movie. The plot is simple and might have been told many times - drugs and it consequences. But the storytelling, cinematography and the splendid acting(each and every actor was simply superb in their role but it was Ellen Burstyn who stole the show) makes you feel as if you know the characters. You feel their addiction, you feel their pain. And if this was not all the background score amplifies all of the emotions during this film. The result : a MASTERPIECE.",9,1,1,15 September 2018
Uri: The Surgical Strike," How's the Josh ? High, Sir. Same goes for the movie.
","Short and honest review here.
Story - Not completely real but dramatised a bit and in places you feel the Bollywood masala touch(2-3 scenes max). But overall a good storyline and a proper chronological order of narration helps in keeping the 'josh' high throughout the movie.
Cinematography - Brilliant. Simply well done.
Acting - Vicky Kaushal plays his part with perfection. Others are also good. But Vicky simply steals the show.
Soundtrack - Amplifies the emotions in the film. Most of the adrenaline rush(more than a few goosebumps moment are there) in this film is owed to the soundtrack.
All said this movie surely is entertaining as well as brings out the patriot in you. But don't go to the theatre expecting a documentary-type film with full fledged facts about the strike for it is not one.",8,0,1,15 January 2019
