The Blair Witch Project," Stink Bomb -- Don't believe the hype
","I was really looking forward to this. I've never seen a theater erupt with boos and shouts of disappointment at the end... until now, that is. No one was happy -- most of the movie is whining about being lost in the woods. There is nothing scary or suspenseful about the film. You begin rooting for the witch before too long.Wow... All I can say is Wow... Stinker. No matter how good the reviews are, no matter how many 9s the Blair Witch handlers tack onto IMDB, know that this is one truly terrible film.",1,1,3,31 July 1999
