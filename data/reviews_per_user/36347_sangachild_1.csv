Changeling," This Is One Of My Favorite Movies Yet
","I Got To Say That This Is One Of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen. There Was A Good Plot, Great Acting, And Great Directing By Clint Eastwood. I Was Really Impressed. Near The End Was Probably One Of My Favorite Parts. When The Killer Is Just About To Get Hung And He Starts Singing, 'Silent Night'. I Got Chills! It Was That One Moment When Your Like He's Just About To Die.The Flash Back Was One Of The Most Shocking Things That I Saw In The Movie. When You Just See The Blood Flying Everywhere. I Was A Little Dazed At The Time, So When I Saw That It Made Me Jump Really High In My Seat.And After All Of This, I Can't Believe That This Is A True Story. I Mean, I Know It Is, But The Whole Thing Is Just So Shocking And Weird, But At The Same Time Amazing! Overall I Was Very Impressed And I'm Hoping To Buy This Movie On DVD.",10,2,4,5 April 2009
