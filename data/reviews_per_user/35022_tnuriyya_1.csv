Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of the worst I have seen in a long time
","I made a big mistake by not familiarizing myself with the character 'Ali G'. I was misled by all the hype for this movie. I was expecting something really clever and witty and would make us laugh at ourselves. I was very anxious to go see this movie. What I received was vulgar, racist, tasteless shocking dialogue. I was incredibly uncomfortable. I walked out after an hour. I figured it was not going to improve. People called this movie 'the funniest thing they had ever seen.' Funny is relative. I think I laughed once during the movie. Most of the time I was squirming in my seat. Unless you like Ali G I would not recommend this move unless you like uncomfortable, embarrassing, tasteless scenes. I think when the word gets out this movie will fall into obscurity.",1,9,19,24 December 2006
