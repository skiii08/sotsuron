Resident Evil: Afterlife," Disappointing
","A disappointing sequel that focuses too much on the novelty of 3D graphics and completely lacks a story arch or any kind of story at all. The promising start of the movie, with Alice and her clones attacking an Umbrella facility, is immediately cut short and the rest of the movie is rather dreary. When you compare Afterlife to the awesome original Resident Evil, it's just a big, big let down. The Resident Evil series has had its up and downs with a great start, a disappointing sequel and then a pretty good third installment. The fourth installment is better than the second but not nearly as good as the third and doesn't even come close to the first Resident Evil.",5,1,2,28 March 2011
