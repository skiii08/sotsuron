Blade Runner 2049," Great if you need to fall asleep
","Boring and slow and at times really stupid given how it is supposed to be a dystopia, but there are pretty slender girlfriends, instant food, cute hookers and tech to enjoy. This at least made me laugh My advice if you have to go is take a blanket and pillow fast forward to the girlfriend and threesome scenes and then get a good shut-eye.",3,18,30,28 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I still love Star Wars - Just Not Disney 'Star Wars'
","Disney is good for five-year-olds and of course hires remake/rip off hacks like JJ Abrams.
Let me say this... In no way is The Rise of Skywalker a good movie. It has many flaws. That doesn't change the fact that I love Star Wars. This is not Star Wars however. It has tons of coincidences and moments of supreme Mary Sue-ism. Yes most of the events were predictable. The one-liners are so Disney and the new characters rolling off the conveyor belts in China as I write.Star Wars stood no chance with JJ Abrams and these 'actors' and 'actresses.'",2,46,80,28 December 2019
