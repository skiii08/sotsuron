The Avengers," How can such a huge and dynamic film be so easily forgettable?
","'Marvel's The Avengers' deserves full credit for it's dynamic execution in bringing the Marvel cast together, as it was a very well-structured and firmly put-together blockbuster by the exciting character-driven filmmaker, Joss Whedon. The clash and the interactions of each Marvel hero, and the development of this was exuberant, witty, and simply hilarious. As the film progressed into the action tone and the all-out, explosive warfare in New York City, the teamwork and building chemistry couldn't be anymore dynamic, and yet still humorous from Whedon's continuous comic relief of the combination of these contrasting superheroes. Although, after all this popcorn fun, simple but vital flaws remain.The score of this massively anticipated Marvel feature should've had a magical and intense sound similar to 'The Lord of the Rings' or Christopher Nolan's Batman films. Instead the score failed to connect, as it lacked in 'pure epicness' and beauty, and ultimately the film lost connection with one of the most important aspects in a film. Not only did the sound and score of the film not work, but the very simple story was exposed from the lack of depth in the telling of the story. This ultimately made the film feel smaller and weaker than it should be. With these small, yet very important, aspects of the film, frustratingly, not executed well, instead of 'Marvel's The Avengers' ending on a high-note, it ends having zero connection with the story and characters, except Mark Ruffalo's brilliant interpretation of The Hulk, because the lack of connection from the score and the lack of depth in the storytelling ultimately wore on everything else that appeared on screen. What lack of connection in a film leads to is a forgettable movie because if a film doesn't connect and stick with someone, how can that film possibly be remembered. But it's 'Marvel's The Avengers,' how can that be forgotten? Very easily. The concept won't be forgotten, nor will Joss Whedon's incredible character-portrayal of each superhero be forgotten, but it will be the anticipation and the potential brilliance in the other huge motion pictures in 2012 such as 'The Dark Knight Rises,' and 'The Hobbit' which will make 'The Avenger's' be that film where everyone thinks, 'what was that movie that came out earlier this year, it was a huge movie...oh yeah, The Avengers how could I possibly forget that.' It's not because the film wasn't good, it was an awesome and intense blockbuster to watch, but it was the little things that left the film slightly over par.Simplifying it down, 'Marvel's The Avenger's' was a fun film and one for everyone to see and really deserves high praise for it's execution of it's characters. Although, as glorious as it looked, it unfortunately did not sound nearly as good as I wanted it too. Yet, the film is still easily likable to any viewer because there is so much to like about in the excitement of this film.",7,4,10,2 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The cheesiness was disguised, but disguised beautifully by the visual power of this ultimate movie experience.
","The ultimate summer movie experience! 'Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith' was fuelled with so much excitement, emotionality, intensity, darkness, and 'epicness' that it's almost impossible to not feel the grand-scale size, massively huge vision, and powerful visual George Lucas approached this film with. There are times in this film where it's almost hard to handle the dramatic, and riveting moments that immensely build-up and setup the stories of the old and classic 'Star Wars' films. It is definitely a fantastic popcorn blockbuster that is one of the best theatre experiences a viewer can have. It does sound pedestrian, however, 'Revenge of the Sith' is just 'SO INTENSE!' Lucas couldn't have done more in the delivery of the film.Take away all the intensity and power this film holds, it's obvious to say George Lucas really knows how to disguise an almost humorously cheesy movie. The script of this flick is just absolute cheese. It's almost as if the writers of 'Revenge of the Sith' meant to make the script cheesy. Not only that, the direction of actors in this films goes to a level of cheesiness that I never thought existed. Hayden Christensen, first of all, was either poorly casted or he is just not that convincing of an actor. I guess 2 Razzi's for Hayden kind of proves the answer to that question. I think Heath Ledger, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Orlando Bloom, or an actor who has a convincing evil and good aspect to their quality of acting would've fit into the role of Anakin much better. Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi on the other hand was just fantastic, and really gave this film a breathe of fresh air. Natalie Portman is a great actress, and even though most of her lines are very cheesy, she somehow made them sound really good. Hayden Christensen however, couldn't say one line right without it sounding similar to a cheesy character from an action video game. In a perfect world, Heath Ledger I think would've nailed the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader. Also, in a perfect world, it would've been so much better if the film spent 10-15 more minutes in the middle showing Anakin turning to the dark side because he turns in a flash. One minute Anakin is sketchy about saving Palpatine from arrest, and the next he's marching hundreds of storm troopers up the Jedi temple. Doesn't make much sense. I always imagined Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader to be torture for Anakin as he suffers and still believes in good, but loses his mind from physical pain and mental pain or something dark and convincing. I also kind of thought the reason Anakin turned wasn't a great reason. My interpretation of it was maybe Palpatine was vulnerable and needed a new apprentice and so he gathered several random individuals from the street, provided them with lightsabers, even though they don't have the force, and storm Padme and Anakin's home. At this point, Padme has already given birth to Luke and Leia because Leia spoke of her mother in the original films. What happens is Anakin believe they are the Jedi and they attempt to arrest Anakin, and Anakin is beat to a pulp and Padme is taken away. Anakin goes rage and joins Palpatine because he is the only one he can trust, and fights against the Jedi and ultimately loses himself, and turns to the dark side. When he realizes his wife was not murdered by the Jedi and she tells him the truth, Anakin is so deep into the dark side he kills her and as the film progresses he fights Yoda, and the film is very dark. That was always my interpretation of how the film was suppose to be because the reason and story is more powerful. However, that is only in a perfect world and ultimately, this film was fine the way it was.If the script and the direction of the actors in this film was not as cheesy as it was, and if they spent a little more time on the transition of Anakin's dark side transformation, and if Anakin was played by more of a convincing transitional actor, this film could've been as good or even better than the original films. Even though the cheesiness was disguised by all the visual power, it was beautifully disguised so ultimately, it worked. 'Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith' is just pure excitement, and everything you want out of a huge blockbuster like this. Really hits you on all levels and connects with you on all levels, even if you aren't a Star Wars fan.",7,0,2,2 June 2012
