Walk the Line," Relatively alright line to walk
","Walk the Line by James Mangold is a biographical film about one of the greatest songwriters of all time; Johnny Cash. It premiered on the 4th of September 2005 and grossed over 180 million dollars worldwide. As a big Cash fan, I thought the movie was pretty good, but I had few issues.Let's start with the good things. The film is based in the 50s and 60s, and they pulled it off well. As a history lover, I appreciate the small details in people's speech and actions, which give you a good presentation how life was like in the 1960s. Casual racism, wives getting tossed around and only getting fined for carrying 600 pills were key elements in the 60s, so those things present in this movie made it enjoyable from a historical perspective.I also must talk about the soundtrack. It consisted mainly of Cash's own songs, but also had songs from Bob Dylan and Willie Johnson. It might be on of the greatest movie soundtracks of all time. Correct songs were chosen to correct scenes, and they gave more depth to these moments. The best part might probably be, that the actors sang the songs themselves.But some things weren't right. In general, it was hard to follow the timeline in the movie, because sometimes the movie would just skip a few years without telling the viewer. Dialog got really confusing and hard to follow during scenes, because of the horrible Southern accent that the actors were doing. It was truly awful and made no real contribution to the movie. Also, there were some historical inaccuracies; Cash did not start his Folsom Prison gig with Cocaine Blues, but with Folsom Prison Blues. I might be nitpicky, but these really bothered me.Despite all these things, I really enjoyed the movie. It gave a good perspective on Johnny Cash's life and all the things he went through. Even after 17 years after Cash's death, he still influences lots of people and this movie really tells you why.",8,0,0,26 April 2020
Elizabeth," Very good idea, mediocre execution
","'The Virgin Queen' has been subjected to many different art forms over the centuries. Great acts, songs and paintings have been made in honor of the greatest woman monarch ever lived. As a massive history-nerd, I was pleased to came across this movie and was super excited to watch it.The movie starts with a scene, where three protestant are brought to executing. It's the year 1554 and soon the Wyatt's rebellion breaks out. It seems to be spring or early summer, which is not particularly historically accurate, because the rebellion started around the late winter months. But by far the most annoying thing about this movie was its ending. The movie ends on a scene where Elizabeth announces her marriage to the people of England, symbolizing her loyalty to the throne. It's around the year 1571. After that, starts the 'golden age' of England. The British Empire becomes the powerhouse of Europe, dominating their neighbors economically, militarily and Elizabethan theatre becomes world famous. Elizabeth defeats the 'undefeatable' Spanish Armada and secures her position as a reputable world leader, while ending Spanish world domination. NONE of these events are even mentioned in this movie, which is very boring and disappointing.Overall, the movie is pretty decent, but too focused on the insides of the English court.",8,0,0,15 June 2020
The Irishman," Scorsese does it again
","You can never go wrong with Scorsese movies, and The Irishman shows you why. Hands down one of the best movies made in the 21st century.",9,0,1,16 June 2020
Eyes Wide Shut," Misunderstood masterpiece by the man himself
","This was the second Kubrick movie I saw and, to be honest, I've never felt more confused after a film. Absolutely a fascinating movie!",9,0,0,24 June 2020
Pulp Fiction," One of the best movies of all time!
","Pulp Fiction was my first Tarantino I ever saw and was instantly hooked to them. The 'reverse' storytelling, use of language and the extreme (altought sometimes meaby overusage) of violence made me a huge Tarantino fan.Pulp Fiction has everything that a crime/drama movie needs. Interesting characters, different settings and very VERY hooking story.I highly recommend you to watch this movie!",10,1,3,12 June 2019
The Godfather: Part III," This is how you end a trilogy!
","I've said it once in the past and I'll say it once more. Movies don't make me cry.BUT, the ending made me tear up a little bit.Anyone who knows me, I have a soft spot for children and don't want anything bad happening to them - that's why Travis Bickle wasn't THAT bad of a person :D. Even if the kid might be 20 years-old they're still someone's children. Seeing your own daughter murdered in front of you was just too much for me.The Godfather III is just a masterpiece and should be watched by every film enthusiast.",9,0,0,23 June 2020
Marriage Story," Was skeptical at first.
","I'm not a big fan of rom-coms/rom-dramas, but this was great. Charlie and Nicole were great characters and I feel some people can really relate to them. Personally, I didn't like the plot that much because it left too much things open. But I will credit Baumbach for not using the 'and they got back together plot' because those get boring after awhile.9/10 coming from a non rom-drama man.",9,7,10,15 February 2020
