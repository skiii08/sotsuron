Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, nostalgic, but not the best.
","Ok, so Star Wars episode 1 is a pretty good movie in my opinion. It has some great moments, and it has it's bad moments. I love Darth Maul, even though he has a very short amount of screen time. I love to Pod Race scene, and I love the main cast of characters. What carries this movie is the cast. While the plot is a bit convoluted and boring, the main cast of characters keeps the movie interesting and fun to watch. Is it the best in the saga? No. But it's still quite a fun movie and one for the true fans.",7,1,2,4 February 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Pretty good
","Rogue One. What to say. This movie is good, but the main cast of characters are so not fun. While this movie visually looks amazing, you never get to feel with the main cast. This movie has some of the best action, but it's hard to love the movie when the main cast of characters have no arc whatsoever.",8,0,1,4 February 2020
Captain Marvel," Your average superhero movie
","Its not as intense as Infinity War, it's not as bad as the Incredible Hulk, but it's as good as the First Avenger. It has a solid decent plot. But LOTS of plot holes. Decent villain. Brie was not as good as gal in Wonder Woman but was good.",7,1,5,8 March 2019
Ready Player One," 2nd favorite movie ever
",It is outstanding I loved it. It is worth every penny you spend.,10,4,8,27 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better then Episode 1, but still has its flaws
","Attack of the Clones is without a doubt, the most cringy of all the Star Wars movies. But does that make it the worst? Actually, no, no it doesn't. Episode 2 is a light hearted, fun adventure for fans. It has some great fight scenes, and some awesome set pieces! Honestly Episode 1 is better structured, but I have a lot more fun with this film, then with the first one. It's a solid movie, and more for the younger viewers.",7,1,2,4 February 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the best films ever made
",This movie is incredible. Soooooooo good. Everything from the death of Sauron to gandalf v the balrog is great. I've seen this movie more than I have breathed. Would definitely recommend to all audiences.,10,0,1,5 January 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Best of the Hobbits
",This film is great. Not as great as the first 2 lotrs but it's the only hobbit movie up with them. It's visually stunning and has great scenes. The only problem is the spiders are a little cheesy and the whole kili and tariel relationship is trash,9,0,5,5 January 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Very good
","Better than u think. Has great score and effects and the whole film is entertaining, but it is very slow. Would definitely recommend",8,0,0,5 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Slowest but almost as best as the first
",This film is almost as good as the first one but it lacks some qualities that made the first film amazing. It is a little slow and nothing really happens until the battle of helms deep. It still is a definite recommend,9,0,0,5 January 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Mayoanator
",It's actually a good robot movie. It does have flaws but it's fun. The one this is you don't know why the fallen really wants revenge,6,2,2,20 July 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Soooooooooo disappointing
","This movie is good but flat sucks for a Tolkien movie. The WHOLE film is a battle, and some of you may like that but it lacks a story the 1st hour is decent, but after that the whole film goes downhill.",6,2,3,5 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A HUUUUGE STEP UP FOR THE PREQUELS!!
","Ok, after the decent first two prequels, I was expecting this one to be cringy and boring like the last two. BOY WAS I WRONG! Revenge of the Sith is one of the best films in the saga. It's my 3rd favorite of the entire franchise. This movie has the best action in the series, and It's actually pretty sad. I love everything about this movie, and it truly is a Star Wars movie. This is a must watch for all fans!!!DEW IT!!",9,2,3,4 February 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Great film but my least favorite of the lotr series
",This movie being visually incredible lacks a true ending. The whole film is great and sad but the end has like 5 endings just pick one,7,0,1,5 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," THE FIRST STAR WARS MOVIE
","Ok this movie is almost perfect. I really, really love this movie. The only thing that puts this at a 9 is the fact that it's a bit boring in some spots. But besides that, this movie is a masterpiece and my 2nd favorite in the whole saga!",10,0,0,4 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best sci-fi movies ever
","THIS IS BY FAR, THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE, AND ONEOF THE BEST SCI-FI MOVIES EVER!!! Empire Strikes Back is a Masterpiece at its best! I love this film and everything about it screams adventure and STAR WARS!! WATCH IT EVEN IF YOU AREN'T A STAR WARS FAN.",10,1,2,5 January 2019
