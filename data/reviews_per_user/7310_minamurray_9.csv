The Sound of Music," Edelweiss, small and white, clean and bright...
","'What kind of fruitcake likes this insanely unrealistic story?' So wail those who hate Sound of Music: Austria as Ruritania, Julie Andrews as cheerfully smiling, singing and dancing novice/governess and so mercilessly sanitized children that they make mockery of every real brat that has ever lived. And there lies the irony. Loosely inspired by the true story of Trapp Family Singers, this musical about singing Austrian family escaping Nazis is indeed insanely unrealistic. It is richly Technicolored, fancifully romantic, clean and entertaining, made with old-fashioned class and craftsmanship... old-fashioned, yes, and in the good way.",8,3,11,2 November 2009
Beauty and the Beast," Beautiful outside and within
","This is atypical Academy award contender for Best movie (in 1991) - it is a good movie! Gorgeous Gothic romanticism of dark forest, Gothic castle and enchanted rose are lovely to look at. Belle is a heroine with inner and outer beauty, Beast makes interesting tragic monster who needs to learn to love and be unselfish and Gaston... well, he is sleazy, shallow bully, very villainous. Scene where the scum goes to attack the castle, singing the best song of the whole movie, shows that at least Gaston has voice! Much, much better than Pixar films - yes, Toy Story included! - and in par with such classics than Snow white... perhaps even better!",10,5,6,29 June 2010
Gone with the Wind," Glorious movie and true classic
","Positive: Made in 1939, this adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel about selfish Southern belle and American Civil War shows how badly made many modern movies are. Colours are rich and beautiful, unlike in most modern films, making costumes, sets and scenery look gorgeous. It has really epic quality and vibrancy. Vivien Leigh is perfect as heroine Scarlett - lovely to look and full of life, but rotten to the core in the same time. Negative: Morally the movie is more problematic. I am not fan of Kim Newman, but I think he said it well: He gave it 5/5 rating in Empire but said it is a movie of 'selfish cow'. Quite frankly, treatment of everybody outside Southern upperclass - including Northerners and poor whites - is irritating. Ku Klux Klan, who terrorized blacks and whites, is supposedly a group of chivalric knights. And the movie was actually cleansed version of the story: book is full of whiny, maudlin, glorified trash who murder and terrorize left and right and never takes responsibility of their own actions. Verdict: Glorious movie and true classic, even if it's characters ARE verminous, whiny trash.",10,0,2,28 September 2009
Twilight," Murky twilight
","I have not read Stephenie Meyer's much-discussed, beloved and hated mega-bestseller. I am not hater of Twilight either. Actually, people polluting net with such 'literature' like 'fat Mormon beep who should be killed' are - grrr! - pottymouthed, weightist filth, and potty-mouthed, weightist filth belongs in the sewers. Seriously. And yes, every vampire book and movie uses different rules: for example, vampires of folklore and classic literature like Dracula and Carmilla walked in sunlight before 1922 Nosferatu. However, my problem with Twilight is the total lack of entertainment value. Love story between human girl (Kristen Stewart) and vampire boy (Robert Pattinson) is a plain, drab story of teen infatuation, with ugly washed-up colours and pale make-up on boy's face. There is no style, atmosphere or fun. Thereis no romanticism. Visuals are drab every-day life with some supernatural action. Perhaps it worked little better as a novel.",4,1,4,8 November 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Twineutral's opinion: This moon lacks magic
","Now, I am not a sexually frustrated, misogynistic guy writing pottymouthed rant because girls drool over Edward Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. And I love lush, otherwordly quality of good vampire movies - gorgeous fruitcake beauty of Coppola's Dracula or wonderful Hammer Gothic are first examples coming to mind. I have not even problem with idea of mad love, described as 'abusive' by so many - forbidden love which does not care about conventional ideas of right and wrong is classic theme. Unfortunately Twilight Saga: New Moon is just... inoffensive bore at best. Yes, it is clean, cgi wolves are cute, and those vampire rules... for Heaven's sake, you stupid people, stop moaning over vampires who do not burn in sunlight: every book, short story, TV series and movie has their own rules, and vampires of folklore and classic literature like Dracula and Carmilla walked in sunlight before 1922 Nosferatu. However, love triangle between human girl Bella (Kirsten Stewart) and two boys, vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is told with all the lush, otherwordly quality of yours truly making coffee. Mad love between Edward and Bella is so boring, that their can't-live-without-you dialogue does not work. Yes, words are there, but they ring hollow. Nor filth nor gem thus 4/10.",4,12,22,22 November 2009
30 Days of Night," Tedious trash
","Animalistic vampires hunting humans... good idea? Well, it depends. Like romantic vampire can turn boring 'Sexy' bloodsuckers in trashy clothes (Underworld, I'm watching at you!), so can scary vampires create gory garbage instead of chilling atmosphere. Classic comic book Tomb of Dracula (which also introduced Blade, star of trashy movie series) had once atmospheric adventure where group of Transylvanian kids hid behind crosses in their small hut under the siege by vampires. 30 days of nights is based on comic book, too, and on very bad one, if this film is believed. Vampires led by murderous atheist (?) attack a little Alaskan town where is whole month of night. Young sheriff (Josh Hartnett) must to save the day... eer, night. Result is ugly, unentertaining, boring garbage - just like Blade franchise or sleazy From dusk till dawn movies.",2,1,5,16 December 2009
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Full of stunningly beautiful and interesting imagery
","Whatever they say in those negative reviews, they are wrong. Wonderful imagery of lush colours, lovely women in lovely fruitcake costumes, gorgeous sets, roses which boom and wither, rich rubyred blood... Special effects are beautiful and actually support the story. Characters - ah, the characters! Yes, Dracula is sadistic massmurderer before turning to a vampire, so the film-makers sympathy plea IS obscene, but Oldman's portrayal is multifaced - he is probably best Dracula, easily outshining much-hyped Christopher Lee. Lucy is turned from virginal, wimpy heroine as nymphomaniac, making poor Stoker to spin in his grave like a mad, but like delicate, doe-eyed Mina (ideally cast Ryder), she is both full of life and feast to the eyes. James V Hart's script is excellent, and the score is a masterpiece in it's own right. The film is great baroque fun, like Hammer Gothic made in modern times... just mistitled. Not for Dracula purists, though, or fans of gore/exploitation crap.",10,1,5,13 September 2009
Casino Royale," Art is Gloomy, Sulking and Cynic
","Oh my God, Twilight is such Evil Fluff, while men have Serious Art. How do you know Casino Royale is Serious Art? Because it is painstakingly Gloomy, Sulking and Cynic, disastrous attempt to make men's own Superficial Series as Serious Art. Result is one of the worst Bond films ever, perhaps THE worst one. Daniel Craig as J Bond, always a sexist with brain between legs and without sissy things like moral compass, is now totally sociopathic and he and plastic Eva Green as tragically tortured heroine have less chemistry than me and my laptop. Story is boring dross with dollop of sadism and token not-too-happy ending. There's no style or entertainment value.",2,5,9,1 January 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Who hid the lighting lamp?
","I'm sure Stephenie Meyer had pure motives to do Twilight books: she wanted to create romantic, clean Love never dies story, with thrill of danger, but without jumping to the sewers. Unfortunately, these films are quite awful: there is nothing romantic, lush and otherwordly in them, so unlike in the mistitled but brilliant Bram Stoker's Dracula. Characters, plot and settings are boring - I'm sure Bella is sweet person, but I just can't care about her love life - and there is no visual style. Actually, one thing I really hate in these modern films is ugly photography. Who hid the lighting lamp? Atmospheric lighting is not same thing than BAD lighting and this ugly, muddy colour scheme. However, I hope that those who still Ã­diotically whine about changed vampire rules, would stop. Please, everyone and their cousin changes them, not even vampire folklore agrees with all rules because they differ from country to country, and for example, Dracula walked happily in sunlight.",3,7,10,12 August 2010
