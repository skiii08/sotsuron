Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," great movie
","The Phantom Menace is what the fans of the trilogy have wanted for a very long time. Lucas did a great job with his casting, especially for Obi-Wan Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor.  If I were Lucas I'd have put in more Kenobi but I would like to see McGregor in Episode 2. I personally liked Jar-Jar, most people just don't understand because they do not know how to listen. This is as good as I expected.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
