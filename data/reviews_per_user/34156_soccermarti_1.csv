Child 44," Great imagery of what life was like in Stalin's Russia.
",This movie has been banned in Russia so it's a must see now. The imagery of what it was like to live in Stalin's Russia are very well done. In popular culture there have been very little focus by Hollywood on that part of history. One of the reasons is obviously that Soviet Russia was a closed society. The movie itself is gruesome and is not for everyone but I enjoyed the background and the setting of the movie and that it does give you a glimpse to what life in Soviet Russia really was. The other 2 negative reviewers are obviously Russians upset at anything that shows the Soviet reality. This is a unique look at the time period that gets very little attention by Hollywood and in my opinion a must see.,10,73,170,15 April 2015
