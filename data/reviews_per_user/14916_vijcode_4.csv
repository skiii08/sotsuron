The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Surprisingly brilliant, poetic with a powerful ending.
","Having not read the novel & knowing very little about this movie other than the trailers & positive rotten tomatoes rating I took a punt on this movie. At first it appears like a typical coming of age teenage angst college drama. You know about the bullied kid who learnt how to confront his bullies & win the day. Forget it its nothing like that. Its a carefully crafted grown up movie about 3 teenagers, & how their lives have been affected by their different experiences. Its a performance centred movie with affecting performances,comedy that is befitting of the characters & some very touching moments. Its a movie that as you watch are unsure where its leading to or whether it is actually going to lead to anything of any meaning. I have to admit I didn't see the ending coming but when it does all that seemed insignificant & just part of filling the movie preceding the climax becomes of major significance & hits you with an emotional wallop. Without giving the ending away be prepared to be emotionally torn up. Even the peripheral characters in this movie in those final scenes take on greater importance & only add to the emotional climax. There's some wonderfully poetically moving voice-over from the Story's main character which is stirring spine tinglingly memorable stuff. It stirrs you from within & completes the movie in befitting fullfiling way. Surprisingly better than you may expect. Do yourself a favour & go see this movie.",8,1,3,13 October 2012
Skyfall," Skyfall - More Like Pitfall
","Look I totally get the idea of bringing Bond into the 21st Century,making him more pensive, thoughtful & sensitive. But surely that doesn't mean you have to forget about a plot,plausibility & originality. Some have labelled this as the Best Bond movie ever. What were they watching. The movie opened with a fast paced chase scene which although pacey & frenetic to watch had nothing original about it. 2 men fighting on top of a Train, avoiding tunnels & grappling like lovers designed to keep each other on the train when surely the best thing to do is throw em off it. Its old pap & then add in some stupid plausibility about having a fully operational jcb with keys in the ignition to be used to rip a carriage off. Then when the movie decides to give you the plot going forward about some list of agents the baddies have. Soon as that plot is introduced it is then forgotten midway & turns into a story about revenge. Then through out the movie there are some shots of Bond & even the Bond girl stood with legs wide open so obviously shot to make them look cool, because nobody stands like that unless there posing for a camera shot, so obvious it made me laugh. By the way the Bond girl might has well have not existed, it was bizarre how Bond manages to bed her after one meeting in bar. Older Bond movies although painted Bond as a womaniser at least built some plot in that appeared believable for Bond to bed his girl. Seriously this Bond girl may well have not been in this movie thats how insignificant she is. Then the rest of the film is littered with so much plot holes & gaffs they are too many to go through. When the film looked interesting for a bit midway, it suddenly dawned on me why, it was blatantly copying a plot from The Dark Knight. Then the climax & this should say it all. An old codger, M & Bond carry out a Home Alone trap in a cottage in Scotland to lure the baddies. Epic or what??? Seriously devoid of originality, plot, action & laughable plot leaps it beggars belief. Avoid at all costs, I wish I had.",3,7,16,17 November 2012
Prometheus," Prometheus, portentous more like it.
","Have to say ever since I seen the first trailer for this movie I thought this would be the top summer movie...Well what a disappointment. Like most I was expecting a Clever thought provoking sic fi epic. What we got was a mess. The movie pretended to be about the origins of our life and why we are here. Epic questions or what....But that's where the epicness ends. The plot if u can find one revolves around a set of foolish scientists doing everything possible to ensure mayhem and death follows them. The film played more like a horror movie than a sic fi. Unsettling stomach dissections, heads bursting &head ripping. I know suspense is important but if you're gonna set the premise up for such big questions the audience deserves some answers. There aren't any and what you get instead are excuses for nods to the old Alien movies. It seems like Ridley Scott felt left out at the blockbuster stakes and tried to come up with something. He has, a mess of a movie and a disappointing taste in the mouth. The film ended suggesting a sequel. I'd imagine it would be to explain the so many un answered questions of this movie. If that's what it set out to do then that's why this movie felt so pointless and unfulfilling.",3,13,26,3 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight didn't quite Rise enough
","Im probably the only person who isn't giving this movie more than 8 stars & will probably will be hated for it. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie a lot, but it just fell short of greatness when compared to The Dark Knight. I wanted TDKR to rise above TDK and fully expected it too. Maybee I wanted too much from a Threequel, lets face it how many 3rd movies have outdone their predecessor. Whilst it delivered in terms of spectacle & scale especially leading to the Climax, but the story & flow of the movie I felt didn't flow & fit like TDK did. TDKR at times suffered from some choppy scenes that didn't quite fit. This is what was wrong with the movie. There are also moments when you have to suspend your believe at some outcomes & although the ending was visually spectacular especially in IMAX some of the capers around the peril at the end of the movie seemed a bit tacky & obvious. O.K. thats enough about the bad points. Now what was good. The fights between Batman & Bane are awesome, thumping, crunching dramatic & thrilling stuff. The Bat is the type of thing that got me giddy, I loved it. I can remember actually bending to my right as I manouvered this beauty around the skyline. There is of course Zimmer's soundtrack which points out when something important is happening or accompanies the action scenes to lift them to another level, in a way only Zimmer can do. Oh and the Batpod does a couple of manouveres which were freaking awesome & again got me giddy too. On the whole when Batman is on screen the movie rocks & with some better more cohesive story telling this would be right up there with TDK. Having written all these points I've just realised I want to go see it again. That says it all, it didn't quite fulfill my expectations but still good enough to watch again, it is a Batman movie after all.",7,3,6,24 July 2012
