Scarface," Incredible
","Well known film director, Brian De Palma, casts critically acclaimed actor Al Pacino in the lead role of his newest film, Scarface. Based on the life of well known mobster Al Capone, Scarface follows the drug lord through the streets of Miami during the late 1920's. The movie illustrates the importance of how storyline and plot development, coupled with top-notch acting creates an impactful film. This movie is exemplary in doing just that.
Scarface is the story of two men from Cuba who eventually make it to the United States and take over the streets of Miami. Making a name for themselves by being some of the most cold blooded mobsters, these two aren't afraid to take care of business the hard way and in doing so, they find themselves associating with major drug lords. After assassinating a Cuban government official, main character Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is issued a green card. Montana's best friend and partner in crime, Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer), tags along with him. After making a few large drug deals and ruthlessly killing anyone who interferes with them in the streets of Miami, Montana and Ribera find themselves at the top of their game. Because of their lifestyle and strong ties to the Mafioso, they eventually hit a major payday. Montana and Ribera become the biggest dealers in Miami, controlling almost all the cocaine that enters the city. A few months down the road, Montana has scored a boatload of money and serious respect from his fellow mobsters. Soon enough, Montanas' profile as the kingpin makes it difficult for him to stay off the grid, and this leads to an ambush at the hands of the Colombian drug cartel and ultimately, his demise.
Al Pacinos' performance in this film is incredibly impressive. The fact that he managed to lead a role of a Cuban drug lords is much easier said than done, especially when you aren't even from there. His stellar performance alongside fellow actors' Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Paul Shenar, who all have strong supporting roles, the film effortlessly weaves the story of these characters into the story. For example, when Tony Montana is first introduced to Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer), he is stunned by her good looks and later discusses his thoughts about her with Manny. Manny believes it is unwise of Tony to attempt and get with their bosses wife, but Tony simply doesn't care. In the scenes with her, we see that Montana may be a criminal but deep down, he has a heart and wants the good things in life. The rest of the cast is used sparsely throughout the film, which I personally believe is a good thing. De Palma implements portions of his cast time at a time. In one scene you see a large scale drug deal going down, and in the next you see Tony with his mother and sister. While parts of the story come off as shallow, as the film progresses you get the feeling that Tony isn't really as bad of a guy as he may seem, he just doesn't like any monkey business and is a straight to the point type of guy. He falls in love, takes care of his family, and always protects his friends. The plot revolves around Tony's next big move and how it will impact his life.
In conclusion, with De Palmas' strong casting of actors and creative directing, Al Pacino and the entire cast define the life of a successful drug lord throughout this film. With so many talented actors and a story that feels pulled from newspaper headlines, it's bound for success. Filled with nearly 3 hours of exciting action, suspense, and very few flaws, Scarface is a phenomenal film with an even better storyline.",9,0,0,22 January 2020
