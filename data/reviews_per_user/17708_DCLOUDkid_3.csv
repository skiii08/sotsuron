Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Stupid on the outside...
","...and brilliant on the inside! I, for some reason didn't see this movie at first because I heard that it was pointless and gross. They were only half true. Actually, make that half of their half.To the common man who wants the point of a movie spelled out to him so he can tell his buddies about it, will not like this movie because the point of the movie is not what Borat is trying to do for his 'country' or 'Pa-mella'. He is basically criticizing Americans attitudes toward something different or not the 'norm' and it's evident by the awkward situations he sets up, the reactions he gets (almost always what he expects i.e. negative), and peoples hatred toward this movie; which is ironically the reaction he was expecting but thankfully there are some people out there who do get it.The half truth of the truth that I mentioned before is that this movie is kind of gross. Most of the grossness is pretty funny though, excluding the scene that was my least favorite hence the 9 (naked fight), but it did play a part in the 'story' so I'll live. I will admit that the black bar over his sh-long was hilarious and couldn't have been done if his wife had made her promise: ' ... she would breaka off my c#@k.' Having said that there are too many classic scenes to list and much of it is subtle humor which is part of this movies brilliance, and a gag I sorely miss in a lot of todays in-your-face-over-the-top-so-much-it's-not-funny-movies (i.e. every 'spoof' movie after Scary Movie 1&2).",9,3,4,23 July 2008
Superbad," Raunchy, but almost exactly how real teens talk.
","And that may seem like a turn off to people (parents in general, but kudos to those who like it) because they don't expect the realism of the characters and their dialog. What people (parents) what to generally see for some odd reason is some High School Musical garbage lifestyle for a teenager which is completely unrealistic.Having said that, a few of the situations do seem unrealistic, but the message of friendship and dealing with life when it doesn't seem to be going as planned is universally understood by all males and surprisingly a lot of cool chicks who can handle the edgy jokes in between.I don't need a whole lot a space to said what I need to say so I'll give you the gist of it. 1. Almost every teen from 16 to 19 (and most guys for that matter) can probably say 'That totally happened to me! It's like they know me!' or 'I've had this conversation!'2. A punch line at every corner, and the jokes never get old. 3. It actually seems to get funnier and not 'That was kind of funny....' 4. Can be watched over and over again. 5. Can be considered this generations Brat Pack, if they keep putting out hit after hit like this. If you don't like constant cussing or sex jokes, then stay away. It's your loss.",10,16,24,22 July 2008
The Dark Knight," I Couldn't Love A Movie Any More Than This!
","Hands down the best movie I've seen in awhile that deserved every single advertisement it showed. Everything about this movie was stunning. The only complaints I've cared to listen to about this movie is the 2 and 1/2 hour run time. First off, if you're complaining about the run time you're not truly into the movie like you should be and are instead worrying about other things and decide to place the blame on this great movie for being too long. I personally thought they could have made it longer because I ate up every minute of it. After a 'certain' plot twist people thought it would end and leave you hanging for the inevitable third installment. I was fooled too, but thankfully it lasted for another 20+ mins of kick ass action and drama! As you've probably heard, Ledger was amazing! My words won't do his performance justice so do yourself a favor and watch this now and prepare for a character you can't help but love and hate at the same time. R.I.P.",10,3,7,22 July 2008
