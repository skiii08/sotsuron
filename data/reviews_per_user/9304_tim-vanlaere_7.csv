10 Cloverfield Lane," Don't let the bad review throw you off
","Today, it's tempting to read reviews in order to avoid watching one of the many bad films that they put out these days. Rehash, reboot, overkill on effects, empty dialogs, clichés or what have you.I did give into my curiosity after a while, fearing this would be a 'blairwitch project'-like movie. But while the movie progresses, you alternate between perspectives and try to understand what is going on together with the antagonist, around whom the story revolves.. You do get some nice unexpected turns. There wasn't a moment of boredom.What I especially liked was, that while the conclusion unfolds, the director DIDN't let himself be tempted to explore and put focus on that aspect. The movie is really about and around the discoveries the antagonist makes, together with the viewer together.I could mention many 'plotholes', but I couldn't anticipate the bends and turns the movies makes I didn't care much and was taken aboard until the end of the movie.",9,0,2,17 April 2016
The Hateful Eight," Disappointing
","You know you go to a Tarantino movie for cinematographic delight and something with a very specific edge.To my disappointment, this movie failed to deliver. While the whole 'it's filmed Ultra Panavision 70'-buzz thrown around - it hasn't been necessary for the few scenes that stand out more.The movie is slow and dreadful. And is divided in chapters, which makes it come off as a book that is half-assed put into film.Nothing worthwhile happens until the before-last chapter where the entire movie is compressed into this 1/6th segment of the film. While 4/6th you see Samuel Jackson as this 'withdrawn and righteous man', 2/6th you get to hear him babble on and on so much and in such a cocky know-it-all way, you long lost interest in this character and really want him to get shot in the balls. The character and Samuel Jackson.The acting performances are very good. I'm not that much of a Samuel Jackson fan, so the camera orbiting him most of the movie just is... Boring.The movie is watchable, the scenes are pretty and the set looks authentic. Some details in the movie are well done and cross referencing. Although, sometimes they're too obvious and 'restated' it loses subtlety.The characters are interesting, but everything gravitates around one character. While the story is stretched out with 'impression shots' and dialogue to come to a short, high paced conclusion. As if it could go on and on and on and then everything rushed to a hasty finale. Where most characters jump out of character, really. And all dimension in the buildup is completely lost. Leaving you with the feeling it's really a political view rammed down your throat - instead of 'a story around the civil war'. The fact the movie seems to be a lecture that 'white to black racism is BAD and only stupid people do this' but 'black to white racism is justified. And black to Mexican racism is a-OK!' just wtf?tl;dr: The concept, 'locked in a hut with strangers, what will happen' has also been done. And arguably a bit more exciting.",5,4,18,6 January 2016
Ant-Man," Family level fun
","The movie is well made but the target audience shouldn't be over 12.It's the Marvel universe about winning and deserving your daughters love. A bit between 'Honey I shrunk the kids' (maybe because of the ants?) with the action-theme blended in. Innocent guards being 'man handed' are for example explicitly saved before explosions. And are just 'knocked out' instead of being gunned down.This also means the characters have a lower level of dialogue and motivations. It also makes the movie less dark and 'intense' as the other superhero movies tend to do.The graphics are well done, there is a cadence in the movie that is fluid. Some humor is thrown in while the main idea of the movie is about 'fathers loving their daughters'. It does seem there has been an effort to display the 'stephfather' as a caring supportive role.",7,1,6,17 July 2015
Captain America: Civil War," boring movie
","This movie is so boring the most exciting thing that happened during this time was when the two attractive girls stood up next to me, almost 30mins in, and never returned.The movie is a long winded emo dialogue with a few weak action scene's and bad attempts towards humor. While all other movies seem to sort of get back to a higher standard... This one must be one of the bottom movies. I honestly could've without wasting my time sitting through this garbage.There is truthfully nothing interesting going on all the time. The dialogues, the 'inner struggles', the tension between the comradery and loyalty. It's a hollow shell that has been a huge missed opportunity.",6,5,13,7 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Underwhelming
","First of, the good. The universe is very true to what we've appreciated in the mention-worthy movies of the series. It's convincing and authentic. The atmosphere is spot on.But the entire movie feels underwhelming: all the focus around a girl and a black dude. While other cameo appearances come into view, of people die where we should care about and feel outraged about. But we know them so briefly, we don't care yet enough or aren't invested enough to be outraged.Planet blown up ? Yes. Outraged? No, who were these people? Oh flash. It's over. Emotional tormented guy, who is he? For a moment I hoped the girl would be brought in front of the 'huge evil force'. Look at this strange looking rebel. Look at him again. He's at it. He's gone. Who was he? We don't care. Half the rebel fighters are gone! oh no! I mean, whatever. The girl is still hanging on a wall ? How did Han solo get up there when there was just 30 seconds left ?And what about the 'these aren't the droids you're looking for' scene? That was... beyond silly and lame.The best thing in the movie is to see Harrison Ford again play and get back into the Star Wars universe. It's very well done.But, before you know it, you realize you are revisiting old scenes and even the same scenario's. Add to this visiting old characters and you feel sortof dragged around this disoriented girl and black dude being confused and not understanding what is going on. But becoming the 'superhero antagonist' without even doing effort for it ? Guess this is 2016. It lacks the sérieux and sense of dedication of the persona's. Even sense of urgency or danger. Maybe it was the script? The actors ?",4,33,39,16 January 2016
Life," The aliens we didn't get
","It's the movie you'd wished when you watched the new Aliens flop. For me, it's better as the last Aliens.The movie is quite thrilling, but then also choatic. It's a thrill, entertaining and you're quite fast at the end with a looming conslusion.it wont be thé movie of the summer, it's good thrilling entertainment.",6,1,4,5 June 2017
Alien: Covenant," Very bad
","You can summerize this movie in one sentence: 'the highly trained space crew had the discipline as the writers of this movie had. None.'There was so much potential for this movie and there are interesting scenes and settings (although, you sometimes only get an uncleaer overview shot where the details would've been interesting too).Many actions of this 'crew that had trained for 10 years for a designated task' didn't behave or have the decision processes you'd expect of such specialized teams. So it ended up feeling clownesque and stupid all the way through.Shame, such potential wasted.",4,174,343,12 May 2017
