The Blair Witch Project," Fear of the Unknown
","The Blair Witch Project came out of nowhere for me. I was young when it was released, thus, all of the marketing and hype went over my head. I didn't see this film until long after the buzz had died down, about three or four years ago.Even then, I knew The Blair Witch was something special. I was still relatively new to horror films, but I knew that nothing had been done quite like this before, and never so effectively.There are no Hollywood gimmicks and touches here. It's not glamorous, the characters aren't typical teens in Hollywood horror, their existence isn't to pad the body count. We see these three people go from confident and determined documentary makers to the brink of madness. We live through this with them, we are THERE with them in the woods, which is what makes their experiences, and ultimately their fate, that much more terrifying.I think the fear we all share as humans is not being able to see what is unsettling us. Things always seem much less frightening after you turn the light on, and in the daytime. In the dark, we are at our most vulnerable. We are essentially, blind. Couple that with the fear of being removed from our comfort zone and there you have it; the fear of the unknown.Someone or something is making those horrible sounds in the woods. Someone, or something left those pile of rocks outside the tent. Someone, or something led them to that house. Someone, or something was hunting them in those woods. But we can't see who or what. We're just like Mike and Heather. Blind.The severe backlash this film has received, has kept it from reaching it's true place amongst the horror greats, in my opinion. Some people scoff at the idea of The Blair Witch Project being listed as one of the greatest horror films of all time. 'The Shining' was panned on its release. Over 25 years later, it's viewed as a classic.In years to come, I hope people look back at this film. I hope people study (or restudy, as may be the case) what makes it work so well. The Blair Witch Project has cemented its place in independent film-making history. My wish is that someday it receives the true recognition and status it deserves.We won't see anything like this again, this was catching lightning in a bottle. Those of you who feel that creeping fear in the pit of your stomach as Mike and Heather enter the house, know exactly what I'm talking about. To those of you who don't feel the panic, the helplessness of this situation, the pure FEAR in those woods, I can safely say, it's your loss.",9,4,7,31 October 2008
The Exorcist," The Power of Your Reputation Exceeds You!
","I'm annoyed at myself. Annoyed, because I don't have a clue how to rate this film. I ALWAYS rate films out of 10 after I've watched them. With some, I might change a rating after some thought; whether it be a point less or a point more. I'm sure that my rating for The Exorcist will fall between 5 and 7, I just don't know which one. But enough about my rating issue.I was not expecting 'the scariest film ever' when I sat down to watch The Exorcist, tonight. I feel this is important, as too often I have seen others build up a film to God-like proportions, that they go into it with the PROMISE that they will be frightened, shocked, disturbed, whatever. When the film doesn't meet their expectations, they feel that it is the filmmakers fault. Not their preconceived ideas of what the film was SUPPOSED to deliver, in their mind, at least.Of course, it's not entirely their fault. The Exorcist is undoubtedly the most well-known, praised and notorious horror film ever. It is difficult to completely ignore the years of hype, and the ever-so widely tossed around 'scariest movie ever' title. But, I did the best I could.The Exorcist is a decently made film. I didn't have any problems with the pacing, I think it's well shot, I think all the actors fit their roles very well. I was not bored during the running time, things just weren't 'clicking' with me.Where The Exorcist falls down is the dialogue, and I'm not referring to Regan's possessed foul-mouthed rants. I thought the script was pathetically weak. Every line is just so clichÃ©d, and uninformative. The cast work adequately with what they've got, but the dialogue is so empty. Characters don't really communicate with one another, they merely accept things and get on with it. This may work for some people, but I just find it weird, and it succeeded greatly in distancing myself from the characters and the events at hand.And that there is my biggest problem with The Exorcist. I didn't feel involved in the plight of this girl. I didn't feel for the characters, I wasn't concerned about their well being or their fate. The best kind of film makes you feel like you are right there watching. Or better yet, experiencing it exactly with the main character(s). Inside (2007) is a good example. Watching The Exorcist, I felt like a mere bystander.I also find the story pretty weak, and not very tightly constricted. The bulk of the film basically rests on and revolves around the possession of Reagan. So we get various visits to her room by different people. We witness her apparent 'worsening' state as time goes on. I'm sure this was terrifying back when it was first released, but for me there is Nada scary in watching a 12 year old girl scream profanities. Most of which could easily come from a demon-free 12 year old boy with an attitude. Although, kudos on the, 'fine day for an exorcism' line. That was a witty one. The rest, not so much. 'Shove it up your ass, faggot!' gave me a smile, though.As for the 'masturbating' scene, to me it looked more like self-harm. I see nothing masturbatory about it, aside from the demon yelling 'LET Jesus F!CK YOU!' Regan was bleeding, so clearly the demon wasn't forcing her to do it for the purpose of pleasure, it was to harm and shock. Which is pretty much all The Exorcist does. There is no great focus on good vs evil, which I would have liked. Instead, Friedkin just throws this possession in our face, then delivers a bunch of gross out and shock tactics, while he expects the swearing, demon-infested, stronger than Hulk monstrosity upstairs to carry the film.Oh, and one thing that's been really bugging me. Maybe I'm missing something here, maybe I'm just stupid, but how on earth did the demon artifact get from Iraq to the steps outside Regan's house? Are we not supposed to know? Are we meant to assume that the demon itself transported the object with its demonic superpowers? Did Father Merrin drop it? Maybe I'll never know.One thing I do know is that I certainly don't think this is the scariest film ever, but I don't hate it either. It's competently made, but it will never be a favourite of mine, and I wouldn't consider it a brilliant film. I think that The Exorcist is a perfect example of its reputation exceeding the actual quality of the film.It's a shame, but inevitable.",Null,1,2,25 October 2008
