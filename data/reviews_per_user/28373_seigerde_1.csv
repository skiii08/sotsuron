Blade Runner 2049," Interesting, not more.
","Ever wondered why Mozart never composed a Magic Flute 2? Well, maybe he did? Or maybe Schikaneder (his 'producer') commissioned another composer to do it. If so, then it is forgotten and for a good reason, I suppose. You should do the same with 'Blade Runner 2049'. Like with another iconic science fiction movie that has been vandalized by a sequel - '2001 - a Space Odyssey' by Stanley Kubrick -, a respected director, a cast of capable actors and an eager effects department try and fail to rekindle the magic. They achieve interest, not more. Interest in the plot ('interesting twist'), the visual design (great)and the philosophical background (been there, done that).I saw the original (again) one week before watching the sequel. Just to be sure not to compare the movie with a glorified memory.",5,5,11,13 November 2017
