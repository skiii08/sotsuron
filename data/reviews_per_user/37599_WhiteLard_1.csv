Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill Vol. MY LIFE
","This movie is magnificent. I'm not going to try to write a fancy review with meticulously chosen words, but honestly, this is one of my favorite movies. The thing that makes this movie is the score. The music in the background makes every scene seem so real and almost like you are there. The action and fighting is amazing and incredibly entertaining. The characters are actually pretty funny, and I almost identified with them. The camera shots are absolutely stunning. Altogether, this is a movie I wish I haven't seen so I could watch it again with the same feeling I had the first time. That feeling was utter astonishment at the beauty of this film. I don't know why this movie is one that sticks out, but watch it and see for yourself. Tarantino did it again folks. He crafted this cinematic masterpiece with his bare hands. Just, honestly, please watch this movie.",9,3,5,2 February 2016
