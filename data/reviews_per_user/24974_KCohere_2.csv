The Blair Witch Project," I really enjoyed it.
","I saw the movie before all the hype so I didn't get a chance to be let down. I don't think I would have anyway. I love this movie because it was so original and yes, it scared the bejeebers out of me. Imagine, a movie that uses the viewers imaginations to be frightening, and not chainsaw-weilding killers. What a concept!",Null,0,2,4 November 2001
Unbreakable," I liked it until the end
","I just have to say that I was going along with it until that little made-for-tv-movie coda at the end. S P O I L E R I liked the fact that Elijah turned out to be the supervillian. It really surprised me and really gave the movie a more comic book feel. But when it said that he was put in a mental instutition, what does that mean? If he's really insane, than how do they explain everything David Dunn could do? It seems to invalidate the whole movie to me. If they'd only left those lines out and left it open ended, it would have been much better.",Null,0,0,11 August 2001
