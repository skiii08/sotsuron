The New World," If this is 'The New World', I'll keep the old!
","Yes, this movie is long. I don't mind long movies especially if they are interesting. Once you grasp the main idea of this one, there isn't much left but beautiful scenery and relaxing music. It's like a spa machine with the tiniest plot line thrown in. Lots of pebbles and babbling brooks, thunder, ominous skies, ominous eyebrows, and very pale, foul smelling English settlers but not much going on in or outside of the characters. The main thrust of the story being the native girls innate spirituality that eventually leads her to happiness in spite of her circumstance. Once that point is made , it's overkill. The heroine is so perfect as to be one dimensional and uninteresting. Colin Farrell is also uninteresting. There are two interesting people in this movie, Christian Bale's character and the tribal chief. I suspect the actual history told with accuracy is a lot more compelling.",3,2,11,22 January 2006
Corpse Bride," Charming and Unique
","I love the way Mr. Burton populates his movies with these wonderfully whimsical characters. While the world of the living is surely one of conformity and drudgery the underworld is populated with colorful and emotionally rich creatures. I very much enjoyed the concept and the artwork. I also enjoyed the hauntingly beautiful piano pieces. I'm not so sure the other musical numbers work all that well in the context of the story.I liked the story idea. I don't think that the Victor and Victoria characters are fleshed out enough so that their fate has much emotional resonance. Emily was by far the most interesting and compelling creature. Overall, it is a treat to a unique experience but I think a little more time to flesh out a few of the characters would have made this an even more memorable movie.",7,1,2,28 September 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Sooo............What.....
","I feel schizophrenic about this movie. On the one hand I thought it was well directed, cinematic ally clever and beautiful. I thought Uma Thurman was terrific along with the rest of the cast. I saw both I & II back to back which is probably the best way to see them. I kept looking for a reason for the madness and I came to the conclusion that the madness exists purely as a clinical and stylized exercise. It reminds me a little of surgery, however, in surgery there is at least a purpose or hoped for outcome-to save the patient. This movie is obviously not interested in the patient only in the clinical exerciseBy the time we are supposed to care it is way too late. This movie is a pop intellectual experience, not unlike a video game. It has all the right moves, music, camera angles, profanity,etc. Once the game is over, no one cares....The package is glittery and seductive but empty. I give it six stars for style and acting.",6,1,3,26 March 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Good Acting!!
","Jim Carey and Kate Winslet give endearing performances as the two main characters who fall in love. The idea that one could completely erase someone from their mind is a complicated and interesting one. After all, isn't that what time does? Time allows us to remember the pleasant and dulls the unpleasant. This movie also speaks to the nature of love. Why do we love the people we do? Is the pleasure worth the pain? etc. I think the movie tries to answer some of these questions.My problem with the movie is it tries to be too clever with all the time changes and jumping around. I also thought the some of the dealings of the other characters was unnecessary. It is a little hard to follow. I think it could have been more emotionally potent with a little straightforwardness. It was still a good and thought provoking movie.",6,1,3,5 June 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Seemed a Little Jumbled!!
","I can't say that I've read the books but I think I should now because it seemed like there was something missing with this movie. I thought that it kept an exciting pace, but the dialogue between characters was a little confusing. The other three contestants hardly said anything and the whole thing seemed a little disjointed. Some of the special effects were outstanding, especially the underwater scenes. The ending seemed particularly rushed. Well, we better hurry up and get the bad guy in here now, so we'll be sure and be treated to another movie. I really liked the other two movies but this one was the weakest. The acting was good but there needed to be more going on between the characters this time.",6,2,3,20 November 2005
War of the Worlds," Aaaaaaaaagh!!!!!!!
","Where to begin. My husband wanted to see this movie so I went without any preconceived ideas. I did not see the 1953 version so I can't compare the two. I usually like most of Spielberg's movies but this one made me take refuge in the ladies room. This was the sci-fi version of 'The Hours.' One continuous, relentless assault on your senses with explosions, lightening, body parts, fake blood, screaming, pouting, robotic aliens, etc., that really had no redeeming qualities. As for the Tom Cruise character becoming a better parent, even an animal would protect it's young during an assault. I understand the concept that we as a species are at the whim of an uncaring cold universe. I also understand the idea that adversity can bring out the best or the worst qualities in people. I even understand that sometimes circumstances can force us to do things that we normally would find unthinkable. This movie was as subtle as a sledgehammer and I hated it. Go see Batman Begins instead.",1,14,31,2 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Disappointed, I was!!
","I loved the original three. The first two prequels were mediocre at best. This was the opportunity to bring it all together and create a strong and emotional bond with the audience. This movie just doesn't do it for me. Granted, I think part of the problem exists with the other two movies. The character of Anakin as a young man just doesn't flow with the man he becomes. There isn't enough thought put into his motivations as a character and the reasons that we are finally left with for his turn to the dark side aren't compelling enough. The dialog was so predictable. The actors have to be given credit for trying, I guess. The special effects, instead of enhancing the story, were for the most part, distracting. I think Lucas was subscribing to the 'shotgun' approach to directing. Let's add everything and hope that something works. It doesn't.In the original three, the moral Jedi universe makes sense. In this last movie, it just doesn't on any level. The sad thing is I really wanted it to.",2,8,15,24 May 2005
