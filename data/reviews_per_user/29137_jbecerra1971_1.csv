E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A classic.
","I was 12 years old when I watched this movie for the first time. To describe how magical this film was for a lot of kids at that time is impossible. As an adult, I realize that it was the bonding between a more evolved specie( E.T) and the innocence and good nature of a human boy ( Elliot)that made it special. It appeals to every one with a good heart.Now keep in mind that the special effects were done with a technology available 22 years ago, nothing compared with what is now at the director's finger tips. But the essence of the movie is still the same, it's a feel good movie classic for the family and the kid in all of us.",Null,6,9,28 December 2003
