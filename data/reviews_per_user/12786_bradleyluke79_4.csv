The Hangover," Overrated.
","I saw this movie a year after its release. During that year, The Hangover was being talked about by everyone. Everyone was saying how good and funny it was. After seeing it, I must say that I was disappointed. I laughed a couple of times. But only because I was in a good mood and some jokes were smart. But these were forced laughs. The movie was well written with a good cast and story line. But it wasn't that funny. I didn't laugh on impulse once. For me, a good comedy is one that really makes you laugh, and you get really connected with the characters. Cause that's what comedies are supposed to do right? Make you laugh.The Hangover just didn't do that for me. I'm giving it an 8. For a couple of reasons. 1. It was well written. 2. Good story. 3. Good cast. 4. Many people seemed to enjoy it.Maybe if I saw it when it came out, I would have enjoyed it more, but I don't think so. Personally I didn't like it because it didn't make me laugh once. But humor is subjective, so I'm not being too hard on it.",8,1,2,11 July 2013
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Hilarious Film, Which Gives off a Good Message
","The Life of Brian is the second installment of the Monty Python films. And what a film it is. Probably one of the greatest comedy films in history. Life of Brian is as memorable as it is original. And I think there's more. I've seen all of Monty Python's films however I don't know much about him or anyone involved in the films. But I think that Life of Brian gives us a message. To Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. I don't think it's just a song at the end of the movie. I think it's a message. Because all of Monty Python's films are making fun of situations. Some frightening or dangerous situations. But the point is that it makes you happy(No doubt about that). It makes light of things. Which is how everyone should live their lives. Some religious people take it too seriously. I'm just saying to lay back and take a joke. This is coming from a raised Christian. The film isn't anti-Christian. It doesn't once mock Jesus or deny the existence of God. I'd say that this film has inspired me to look on the bright side of life no matter what. To be happy. This is a very funny and original comedy. It's a must see film which everyone should enjoy. Python's genius in comedy, returns for another equally great film.",10,2,6,9 August 2013
Superbad," Best Comedy Ever!!!
","I absolutely loved this movie. I have seen it at least 6 times, and I enjoy it just as much each time. While it's not extremely well written, it will have you smirking for weeks. Or in my case forever! I can't speak for everyone but I laughed so hard during this movie. It introduced me to some brilliant actors as well. I got really connected with the characters and the story. I just didn't want it to end. I've watched it with my friends as well and they loved. It's without a doubt my favorite movie. As I said it's not the most well written comedy. But it does what a comedy is supposed to do better than any other movie. Make you laugh!",10,0,2,9 July 2013
Man on the Moon," Hello My Name is Andy, and This is My Review
","From a comedy aspect, I misunderstood it and at times found the movie hard to get around. But the Man on the Moon tells the odd yet interesting tale of Andy Kauffman, perfectly. Andy Kauffman was an eccentric funny man who died before being understood. Often called a comedian but described himself as a song and dance guy.This is probably the one of the most accurate biography movies ever told. With every actor doing they're bit. If you watch actual footage of Andy Kauffman which was in the movie, you will see just how alike it is to the film. Jim Carrey was the best possible actor for this role. And this film really shows the talent that Jim Carrey has, the ability to be absolutely hilarious then flick to emotional and serious.It depicts Andy's life perfectly. And what a life he had. Andy was the kind of guy who took a joke to its furthest extent. He was unpredictable, original, eccentric and good hearted. I actually genuinely think that he was the founder of Modern Wrestling.Man on the Moon is a marvelous, accurate portrayal of the unusual man, Andy Kauffman.",8,0,0,4 August 2013
