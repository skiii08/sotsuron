Skyfall," 'Where is the bond I love gone'
","Stylish, classic opening scene with a theme song to rival any of the classic Bonds. You are immediately thrown back in time to the bonds of old. A by-gone era of style and understated 'Cool'But unfortunately for this viewer, this is where the nostalgia ride ended. I even said to my cinema buddy after the opening song and traditional beginning 'this is going to be good'I go to a bond film for the wow factor and the promise of : GADGETS : Which you know bond will have to use to save himself later on in the film. CARS : A dream car which will be driven hard and is on every mans 'secret bond wish list' WATCHES : BEAUTIFUL WOMEN : Which it has.. and is nice that it is not a sleazy portrayal. BAD GUYS : Should induce mild fear and depravity.Skyfall is beautifully artsy in parts but its not the bond i have grown to love . I want to spend the night in the cinema dreaming of flash cars, nice suits, and ass kicking abilities at everything. I recognise that it was a homage to bond of the last 50 years .. But every bond has a formula which makes him 'bond' This also feels like a reinventing of an older genre. I hope this is not the case as with some films of recent years... Eg: Batman series which really needed it and turned out to be excellent films.For me 'bond' was reinvented with Casino Royale which is head and shoulders above Skyfall in the bond series and i would rate that as the best bond every made .'where is the bond i love gone?'",6,4,10,12 November 2012
The King," A lot to like about this film
",Gritty medieval drama . If your expecting gladiatoresque style action . You will be disappointed. More of an historical slow burn theatrical drama,7,2,2,2 February 2020
