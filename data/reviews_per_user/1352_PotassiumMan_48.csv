Ford v Ferrari," Thrilling race car film will succeeds with flying colors
","Christian Bale and Matt Damon co-star in this vigorously-executed depiction of Ford Motor Company's full-on attempt to compete with Ferrari in the 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1966. This race is expertly recaptured in some of the most well-executed race car scenes in history. Along with exceptional period detail, there is also a riveting soundtrack to help the pacing.Bale gives a feral performance as Ken Miles, the combustible British race car driver who test-drove and helped develop the first Ford vehicle that could go head-to-head with Ferrari in Le Mans. Matt Damon gives a down-to-earth performance as Carroll Shelby, the retired race car driver who worked together with Miles and Ford on the groundbreaking race car. Tracy Letts is an authoritative presence as Henry Ford II, who was initially reluctant to get involved in the race car enterprise but eventually saw a new opening for the automaking giant.The film's narrative is guided by the sure hand of James Mangold's direction. Although the film proceeds initially at a deliberate pace, you gradually become invested and develop a firm rooting interest. Bale and Damon play well off each other and become a heroic duo fighting for both American interests abroad and against corporate chicanery within the Ford Motor Company. All in all, the film will take your breath away. It is proof that sometimes good old-fashioned storytelling aided by strong performances are all you need. Enthusiastically recommended.",8,1,2,24 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Brooding, visually rich sequel diluted somewhat by running time
","The long-anticipated sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic is definitely something you should see in theaters. The visual effects and cinematography alone are enough to make this a movie event that should be watched on the big screen to get the full effect. The film's storyline is slowly hashed out in a smoke cloud of mystery, futuristic dark humor and dystopian milieu. It's Villeneuve's admirable achievement and a worthy sequel.Ryan Gosling is solid as a latter-day Blade Runner, whose job is to hunt for a diminishing number of replicants from an earlier era. Gosling's cop begins to struggle with the question of his own identity and ponders whether the memories in his head are authentic or artificial implants. Ana de Armas is captivating as his artificial flame, who takes on many different forms. Robin Wright is sharp in a smallish role as Gosling's iron-willed superior. Jaret Leto is well-utilized as a creepy industrialist whose bleak vision for society is being implemented. Sylvia Hoecks is effectively menacing as Leto's ruthless enforcer. Unfortunately, the film could have used a bit more of Harrison Ford, who returns to his role as Rick Deckard, Gosling's predecessor from 30 years back. Ford's work in this film amounts to little better than a cameo appearance. But thankfully, Gosling and everyone else mostly fill the void.The film's emotional core is real but very cold and deeply embedded. And some more editing probably would have helped. Although there is a storyline here that you do care about, the film's aloof, almost Lynchian sense of mystery keeps the viewer at a distance for a long stretch. There is a deliberate build-up in the labyrinthine investigation through which Gosling pieces together a macro scale of criminal activity. Villeneuve is able to sustain the film's gripping crescendo just enough that the film reaches a well-executed, well-earned catharsis. Strongly recommended.",8,1,3,15 October 2017
First Man," Neil Armstrong biopic with one of Gosling's best performances to date
","Damien Chazelle goes into biopic territory with this compelling film about the man who first set foot on the Moon in 1969. Although it doesn't always offer the most incisive telling of his story, it gives us a good sense of how Armstrong went from a back-up astronaut, whose professional skill was the subject of much disagreement among his superiors to one of the central players in America's race with reach the Moon in the 1960's.Ryan Gosling is not always known for roles that are too serious. But his trademark irony and youthful foibles are jettisoned in favor of something a bit more stolid and deliberate- and he excels here. My only complaint would be that he eclipses everyone else, including Claire Foy as his devoted wife, Corey Stoll as Buzz Aldrin and Jason Clarke as the astronaut Ed White who died in the Apollo 1 pre-launch test.The sequences of space travel and the landing of the Moon can be quite jittery and unstable, but it does bring to the big screen the nerve-racking experience of space exploration and how much of a risk it was for those who undertook it. If you are susceptible to motion sickness, like my friend who watched it with me, it's a good idea to prepare for this film. The early part of the film also uses 35mm as a way of recapturing the era it takes place in. History buffs and space film aficionados will find a lot to enjoy here as Chazelle brings everything to life. Gladly recommended.",9,1,3,10 November 2018
Hereditary," Surprisingly torpid and frustrating horror film that drops the ball
","Although quite gripping in some places, this film generally left me bewildered at what so many critics were talking about when they praised it to the high heavens. Not because it's terrible but because it's an awfully ordinary film in a lot of ways. Lack of pacing and uneven performances are flaws that critics usually don't forgive.It's a story centered around a family coping with grief and recent loss. Giving away more details would just be unfair. I went in knowing as little as possible and that's what you should do too- IF you plan on taking the time to go see this.Performances here a mixed bag. Toni Collette vacillates between being the film's driving force and at other times being one of its biggest liabilities. In some of the film's intended moments of high tension, her histrionics can border on B-movie acting, which is very strange because back in the day, she gave a powerful supporting performance in 'The Sixth Sense'. Gabriel Byrne gives a dutifully stolid performance as the father in the family and his stoicism is more a counterweight to Colette's reactive performance. Milly Shapiro is an intriguing talent as the daughter, but this film gives us just a taste of her acting chops and nothing more. Alex Wolff is a talented actor who is well-utilized in this film as the teenage son.The film's biggest problem is its long stretches that lack any energy at all. Some moments in the film linger on and on, sometimes to a dulling effect. A film that is noticeably lifeless for any considerable period is not going to easily make up for such a flaw especially if it doesn't finish strong. I found the second half to be more annoying than scary. In the end, this is a near-miss because I do sense a potential master craft in the hands of director Ari Aster. He just might need a really good editor, going forward. Not recommending this film, as it was mostly disappointing.",6,0,1,2 July 2018
Detroit," This film beats you over the head until you cry 'uncle'
","This dramatization of a major incident of police brutality that took place during the 1967 Detroit riots starts off strong. It has great period detail in recapturing the Motor City in its roiling state of anxiety and resentment- an image of a great city on the verge of combustible catastrophe. A growing sense of anger and lawlessness is well-captured here. Furthermore, the film boasts vivid performances by an exceptional ensemble cast. Will Poulter is a standout as a violent, psychopathic police officer who cannot subtract his personal prejudices from the line of duty. John Boyega is also effective as a private security guard who makes a good faith effort to keep the peace but soon finds himself questioning his own judgment.Unfortunately, where the film goes wrong is its decision to have a key police interrogation and torture sequence go on so interminably and so relentlessly that ironically the film loses its power and emotional grip in the process. The evil that is portrayed here goes from convincing to almost cartoonish. A viewer might be forgiven for no longer having their head in the film once the narrative finally moves on. Although no one can accuse this film of having the wrong intentions, it becomes so overheated in its depiction and so didactic in its approach that it becomes a textbook example of cinema where less could have been more. Perhaps less hand-wringing and more tonal balance would have made this a more potent film. But subtlety is not the word here.This is not to say that all was lost. The film goes on to have quite a heartfelt, anguished conclusion and offers a cautionary word that the law and not reason is sometimes the biggest weapon. However, a better work would have left some room for debate instead of trying to pound its audience into submission. Not recommended.",6,32,49,12 August 2017
Rocketman," Campy, heavy-handed mess from the get-go
","This highly-touted film about Elton John that blends the biopic and musical genres together has one big selling point: Taron Egerton's go-for-broke performance as the deeply troubled musical genius. Regrettably, the film as a whole is self-indulgent and cliche-ridden to the hilt and goes down as a misfire.Problematic right out of the gate, the film has to overcome a befuddling start which takes place from the tawdry vantage point of a psychiatric support group and frames the film's narrative from that trivializing angle from there on out. Perhaps a film of better nuance could have pulled this off but here we have camp, mawkishness and exploitation all rolled into one. The end result is a film whose tone is dumbfounding, annoying and at times embarrassing to endure. The musical numbers in this film are mostly perplexing and very rarely effective in conveying this life story.I am not one to criticize a biopic because I realize it's a genre that is beholden to the life it is portraying. While I don't question the film's accuracy in portraying how awful Elton John's personal demons were, a film with more discipline almost definitely could have done better. A campy film, one that keeps poking you in the eye with how bad it is, will not tell anyone's story all that well, let alone a legend like Elton John.Bearing in mind that Egerton's performance has to be seen to be believed, I nevertheless decline to recommend this.",4,153,274,2 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in a remake for the ages
","When I first heard about this, I did not know quite what to expect. On the one hand, Bradley Cooper had never directed a film before and I had no feel for Lady Gaga's acting chops. On paper, it was hard to know if this would be any good.Needless to say, my doubts were answered and put to rest forever by the time I left the theater. This age-old story of a young woman who meets a celebrity on the downward spiral of his career and who becomes the next big thing is wonderfully revived here, with Lady Gaga as a young waitress and singer who meets the legendary country singer Jackson Maine, whose career is beginning to slide amid his drug and alcohol addiction. Sam Elliot is dynamic as his long-suffering older half-brother and manager.What makes this film so memorable aside from its stellar performances? First off, there are a handful of amazing ballads sung by both Lady Gaga and Cooper. Their vocals bring this film to such grand heights, that I might now have a couple of new favorite songs. Lady Gaga's stirring delivery anchors this film and then rockets it to the sky. Just thinking about it makes me misty-eyed. Equally realized besides the music, are the themes of holding onto love and discovering your true potential. In that regard this film had an amazing flare for insightful dialogue.If you're looking for a film that comes from the heart and is as good as people think films used to be and offers some hope, then this one most surely is for you.",10,5,9,10 November 2018
Wind River," Grim, slow-burn crime thriller marks Sheridan's directorial debut
","Taylor Sheridan's achievement in this film lies in his success in crafting an old school crime drama that doesn't try to re-invent the wheel but instead relies on good old-fashioned storytelling. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen are both exceptional as a dissimilar pair who out of sheer happenstance form an alliance to solve the mystery of a young woman's brutal death on an Indian reservation. Renner is a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker. Olsen is an FBI agent sent on an assignment very much alone.The narrative remains low-key but gradually builds toward its gripping conclusion. We come to learn quite a lot about Renner's character through his backstory. He's quite understated and effective in this role. Olsen enters the picture as an outsider to the bleak region of despair that the American wilderness is portrayed as here. She must learn quickly in order to do her job or leave a possible crime completely unsolved.Because this film deals with life on an Indian reservation, much of the social and economic woes might seem unfamiliar at first, but the film does a good job of providing a snapshot of the hardship that pervades in this part of the country and the difficulty that law enforcement has in conducting even a workmanlike investigation. Sheridan depicts a world that is sympathetic and troubled at the same time, masking its tears with courage and doggedness. Recommended to everyone.",7,79,112,4 August 2017
Darkest Hour," Lively Oldman performance mired in a stifling, talky biopic
","Gary Oldman's range is hard to dispute. He has been so many different types of people on screen that a performance of his as Winston Churchill during the Second World War would be an obvious selling point for this film. He does in fact give quite a potent portrayal of the British prime minister, whose character flaws and history of military and political failures were obscured and forgotten as he mobilized the British government and the British people to stand up in defiant resistance to Hitler after the German Army overran continental Europe in 1940.Also noteworthy are supporting turns by Kristin Scott Thomas as Clementine, Churchill's patient wife, Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI whose disposition toward Churchill goes from disgust to ardent support and Lily James as Churchill's dedicated young personal secretary. Finally, Stephen Dillane is constructive as Viscount Halifax, one of Churchill's primary political rivals in the British government.But the structure is a different story. With so many strong performances, the film seems quite content to merely tread water and give the audience little sense of how the war impacted the British people. Most of the movie takes place in closed government quarters, with Churchill either arguing ferociously with an obstreperous war cabinet or negotiating the fears of the crown. This is less a war film and more a political drama about shifting alliances in power and backroom Parliamentary calculations. It's about how initially the British government was anything but united on how to confront the possibility of a German invasion. While all of this is fascinating, it doesn't always make for viscerally gripping cinema. The film's best scene happens with Churchill talking to British citizens to gauge their morale, a rare moment of moral certainty.I normally give a film like this a pass. But extended dialogue scenes in a film like this can actually obscure the war rather than bring it to life. This kind of stagebound account can weaken the story's grave sense of urgency and diminish the scope and ramifications of what Britain was facing in the spring of 1940. Not recommended.",6,0,2,4 January 2018
Captain Marvel," Likeable, dynamic superhero story with feminist panache
","Brie Larson fully embodies the protagonist as a Kree warrior in this energetic addition to the MCU film legacy. She and Samuel L. Jackson (as a younger Nick Fury) face the challenging task of warding off an invasion of Earth by the Skrulls, a species adept at blending in with whatever population it seeks to infiltrate and subsume.The film takes place in California in 1995 and therefore has plenty of joyful mementos from that era. Larson brings her trademark onscreen charisma, and Jackson gives one of his most enjoyable performances in years. Ben Mendelsohn shines as the Skrull warrior who has found his way to Earth. Jude Law is quite authoritative as Larson's longtime Kree mentor. The film is at its best when it covers themes of divided loyalties and coming to terms with one's own discoveries, surprisingly well laid out in a popcorn blockbuster movie. The theme of female empowerment is omnipresent but it lingers on less so than other things this film did right.Perhaps because I came in with such low expectations, this turned out to be quite the pleasant surprise. It won't likely go down as an iconic trailblazer or a future classic. But for those who like a big-time superhero blockbuster experience, this one delivers. Recommended.",7,3,5,16 March 2019
Us," Mystifying, fascinating Peele suspense film, but with a hollow core
","Jordan Peele's follow-up to 'Get Out' is winding, creepy and compelling to watch from start to finish. A young family on a getaway discovers that their vacation home is the target of a bunch of deranged, vicious dopplegangers. There's at least a good formula at work here and there are some truly haunting scenes.So what goes wrong? The film's concept is never fully fleshed out. The events that unfold are menacing and intense but their origin is never adequately portrayed, and is therefore incomprehensible. You might finish watching this with a lot of blanks not yet filled out. The fact that the film has to explain itself so much tells you how confused and muddled the narrative is here. And without giving away too much detail, the plot's conclusion is unnecessary and radical. It largely renders what is already a problematic film null and void.Perhaps it would have been a better idea to label this as a thriller because it does have its share of suspense. A horror film, this most definitely is not. It never becomes that. You're more likely to be bewildered than scared, despite the film's eye for detail and a Kubrickian aura in places.It is a testament to Peele's filmmaking ability that he can make even a flawed effort that is well-acted and full of momentum right up to the closing credits. And the film does boast a crisp soundtrack. I just wish it all added up to something. Not recommended.",6,0,0,9 April 2019
The Irishman," Scorsese epic on Hoffa is well-crafted but very, very long, likely praised out of sentimentality
","The long-awaited Scorsese film on Frank Sheeran, the man closest to Jimmy Hoffa, is brilliantly acted by De Niro, Pacino, Pesci and an exemplary supporting lineup that includes Keitel, Romano, Cannavale and Anna Paquin, whom I haven't seen in a movie in nearly two decades. It also boasts extraordinary period detail, masterfully recreating an America that spans the 1950s to the mid-1970s. And the final chapter of the film is quietly menacing. The total absence of a soundtrack in this part of the film makes for an almost unbearable sense of dread.What prevents this film from reaching greatness? In short, the film's vast, interminable running time. Some supporting characters seemingly disappear for an eternity in this film as their presence is dwarfed and sometimes completely forgotten on account of the film's never-ending trudge to its haunting conclusion. The film has a ghost-of-glories-past feel to it, with Scorsese's heaviest hitters all teaming up to make one last big mark. That might be the main reason it has been so overwhelmingly acclaimed.There's no denying the craft at work here. Unfortunately, Scorsese's long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker did not cut nearly enough to render the tightest film possible and instead the final product is a lumbering behemoth of a film that, although very good, more than likely could have been even better. Recommended to viewers with enough stamina.",7,11,24,17 November 2019
"I, Tonya"," Gripping biographical black comedy gave me chills
","Over time, I have grown weary of the biopic genre. It tends to yield a lot of films that are by-the-numbers and lack an edge. Enter this film that proves the exception, a fiery account of the renowned U.S. figure skating champion Tonya Harding, whose husband and friends got involved in her career in the most sinister way possible and seriously injured a figure-skating competitor of Tonya, Nancy Kerrigan who, as it turned out was equally impressive on ice.The film starts out at the beginning of Tonya's development as an ice skater, when she is virtually a child. The film smoothly transitions to her more grown-up years as Tonya morphs from an adorable little girl on ice to a frighteningly edgy teenage competitor. It is then that we meet her boyfriend, who initially seems like a socially diffident young man, but is quickly revealed to by a physically violent nightmare of boyfriend/husband. Their relationship goes through many twists and turns, but it does witness her defiant rise to greatness within her sport.The film bristles with vivid performances, the most electric of which is Allison Janney who steals the film as Tonya's monstrously cruel mother who shows little regard for Tonya's emotional well-being even as she pushes and pushes harder for her daughter to reach the top. Sebastian Stan is great as her abusive husband/intermittent ally. Margot Robbie finally shows how transformative her acting ability is in this film. She disappears into the role of the figure skating champion whose rise to fame went against the norms of the figure skating sport, that disdained her working class background.There are no heroes in this story; no one emerges looking even decent. But it's a deeply incisive story of how one person's amazing journey took a radically unexpected turn. It will strike a chord with anyone who had to cope with at least one difficult parent, which might make it difficult to watch, but it's a film of absolutely granite integrity. Enthusiastically recommended.",9,4,8,16 December 2017
Molly's Game," Chock full of Sorkinian glibness, biopic goes south in the end
","Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut about the Olympic skier Molly Bloom, a brilliant over-achiever who chose to forego law school to become a gambling entrepreneur, is a compelling film that starts out very strong. Even with its lengthy running time, it's never slow or uninvolving. It's gripping and fascinating throughout, thanks to Sorkin's master penmanship at keeping the dialogue and tempo of the film at a heady pace.Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba both give dynamic performances here. Elba makes a great presence as the defense attorney who tries to grapple with the sheer size and scope of Bloom's considerable legal problems as her gambling operation becomes progressively more mired in the criminal world. Even if you find Chastain's character cold and detached, her performance here is strikingly realistic.Alas, we have the film's ending. Where the film goes wrong is this highly far-fetched and phony attempt to humanize Bloom beginning with a chance encounter with her father at a skating rink in Central Park. A corny scene does not sink a film all by itself, but unfortunately this scene was followed up with an equally ridiculous courtroom sequence that struck me as unduly and comically political. It's always a shame for a film to look first-rate for most of the way only to collapse in the final act. Recommended mostly on the strength of the performances, even if the film as a whole misses the mark in the end.",6,105,149,31 December 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee's return to form
","Easily Spike Lee's best joint since '25th Hour', this is the true story of how a black police officer in Colorado in the 1970s stood up to the Ku Klux Klan's presence through an undercover operation. In this film, Spike Lee has gone back to his old school rage that permeates the social fabric of America in the present day. It's a thoroughly relevant drama and an affirmation of American identity, one that burns with righteous anger but also has moments of incendiary humor aimed at the racism being depicted.Performances here are first rate. John David Washington is the title protagonist, a bold black police officer in an overwhelmingly white community who dares to use his investigative ability to counter white supremacists in his own backyard, an idea he embraces after being sent on an undercover assignment to keep an eye on the black panther movement where he finds much agreement and closeness with those he encounters. Topher Grace shakes off his polished preppy boy image for the menacing role of David Duke, the grand wizard of the KKK. Adam Driver is solid as the undercover Jewish police officer who enters the KKK as the white front for the undercover operation. Although the film concludes less dramatically than I was expecting, it still packs a wallop in terms of bringing very relevant issues of white supremacy to the forefront.This is also a cautionary tale about how resilient white supremacy has been over the course of the nation's history right up to the present day. It's a warning that the same scourge that plagued American society in the era when this film took place is still festering in full force today. A challenging message like that is worth conveying, which this film does eloquently. Strongly recommended.",8,9,18,4 September 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Darkly comic morality tale, and one that deserves respect
","Many have referred to McDonagh's film as a black comedy and it does have a lot of grim humor. But it's also a film about grief, revenge and ultimately about doing right by others. Harsh is the most apt way to describe the film's mentality. Nobody emerges from this story pure. You will come away battle-scarred but also grateful at having absorbed a refreshingly blunt take on human nature. I wish I could say more, but this is a film where one should go in knowing as little as possible, as I did.Frances McDormand absolutely shines as the mother of a murdered teenage girl. She has watched for months as the police department in her local town has not come up with any arrests. She takes matters into her own hands by putting up billboards demanding answers from the authorities. From there on, the town swells into a maelstrom of rancor, vendetta, recrimination and, if I gave away more it would spoil too much. Sam Rockwell is equally impressive as the dim-witted cop with supposedly little self-discipline and a short fuse. And Woody Harrelson is great as the highly-regarded police chief who suddenly finds a roiling controversy on his hands.In terms of cinema embracing a dark, cynical point of view, this is the hardest film I've seen since 'Nightcrawler'. It takes its bleak view of the world and splashes it all over the screen from start to finish. There are scarce moments of rejuvenation and optimism. For the most part, the film revels in its dark sarcasm all the while keeping the audience guessing about the its resolution and making no guarantees. The themes of grief and anger at the system's lack of results and thus taking matters into one's own hands are powerfully rendered here. The sense of victimhood takes a back seat to up-from-the-bootstraps empowerment. Love it or hate it, this film makes its points with conviction and sincerity, however rough around the edges. Strongly recommended.",9,5,10,12 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not as dreadful as some say it is, not as great as it should have been
","After The Last Jedi, this trilogy had momentum and promise on its side. However, because this film went on and on and only began to show signs of life toward the end, I am only inclined to recommend this to Star Wars fanboys, who I submit would love this film out of sheer blind loyalty.Those who are new to this trilogy or who perhaps have never seen any Star Wars film, should not begin with this. The strength of this film lies in its the slowly burgeoning but epic battle between the Resistance and The Final Order. That ultimate showdown is worth the price of admission. I only wish it didn't take that long for this film to come to life.Moreover, the romantic tension between Rey and Ren is a worthwhile subplot, but it eventually became distracting and even funny. I couldn't stop laughing at this part of the film because it's become the stuff of gags. But this is far from the disaster that many audience members have vociferously claimed. If nothing else, it provides solid entertainment. Recommended to the hardest of the hardcore Star Wars fans. Everyone else, decide for yourselves.",7,1,8,29 December 2019
The Lost City of Z," Exploration epic, stirring beyond belief
","One of the few films I've seen in recent memory that lingers on in a haunting way after you've seen it. It tells the story of Percy Fawcett, the British military officer and explorer who made it his life's work to discover an ancient civilization hidden deep in the Amazon jungle. Charlie Hunnam gives the best performance of his career so far as Fawcett. Equally superlative is Sienna Miller, who plays his devoted wife who willingly accepts her husband's insistence on sacrifice in the name of the family and greater glory.Although this film has a lush, visually splendid look, there is nothing self-indulgent or superficial about it. It epitomizes how arduous Fawcett's objective was and how he never let go of what became his deepest longing. The film earns its running time by portraying the psychology of a man whose dream never leaves him.I am not sure the extent to which the film scrubs Fawcett of his own attitudes toward the tribal peoples that lived in this part of the world and I don't care. The film does a good enough job or portraying Fawcett in morally ambiguous shades but also refuses to judge him for the man that he was. The film is more about what went from being an impromptu assignment to an intensely personal cause for one man. It is one of the richest pieces of cinema in recent times. Recommended to the highest degree.",10,31,60,16 April 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Handsomely shot but superficial and cripplingly overlong
","This long-anticipated biopic of Freddie Mercury and how he turned Queen into a band for the ages is only a mixed bag that suffers from serious narrative lapse for long stretches. I liked the look of this film and Rami Malek utterly transforms into Mercury but his dynamic performance alone cannot overcome the lumbering pace. He has to work with a screenplay that for many patches is an utter wasteland.Although there are traces of gripping brilliance in this film (including the film's depiction of the spectacular divide between critics and audiences over the song Bohemian Rhapsody), the more challenging aspects of the story of this incredible band and Freddie Mercury himself are given lackadaisical or non-existent treatment. His struggle with AIDS is given fairly perfunctory attention, as is his relationship with the other band members. For a film with such a long running time, there is precious little to say.The film comes close to redeeming itself when it turns to the extraordinary event of the Live Aid concert in which Queen performed. But it's too little, too late and I only wish the rest of the film could have that raw vitality and stirring force. This is a shame, because although most rock bands over the course of history do not deserve a feature film, Queen is not one of them. Not recommended.",5,7,12,11 November 2018
Baby Driver," Action flick with endless panache and swagger
","There is never a dull moment in this action crime film about a getaway driver who has his own unlimited getaway soundtrack but who also wants to break free from the crime boss who owns his life.There is enough style and visceral strut in this film that it neutralizes the one or two credibility gaps in the plot. Ansel Elgort is great as the title character, but Jamie Foxx steals the film with a lively performance as the loose cannon in the crew. Performances all around are solid and the dialogue is so rife with dueling wits, it's like watching a recurring display of verbal fireworks. These firecracker scenes of competitive criminals showing off their bravado are just as exciting as the chase scenes through downtown Atlanta.The film also banks heavily on a heady, omnipresent soundtrack that keeps the tempo perpetually hyperactive. A word of caution: The action can be tough going at times; the film revels in its permanent state of anarchy before ultimately developing a mean streak. But for all the blistering gunfire and screeching tires, this is not a one-note film. It has its moments of quietly boiling tension and eerie backstory flashbacks. It's a film that wears its attitude on its sleeve and doesn't shrivel into conventionality. Not an absolute bull's eye, but recommended to everyone who wants a good rush.",8,45,79,2 July 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Kaleidoscopic, riveting game changer in the animation genre
","I saw this film on the tail end of its theatrical release, and what a discovery it was. A visceral screenplay and electric animation guide this high-energy, uplifting story about a New York City teenager who by chance becomes one of the many Spiderheroes in the world and his life is never the same afterward.The protagonist is a modest but savvy kid who has a diverse range of influences in his life, from his law-and-order father to his more street-wise uncle. He winds up crossing paths with a number of superheroes each of whom has a unique style, but who also share a common goal- stopping an evil crime kingpin from opening a vast, destructive portal to another universe. There are themes of family challenges, building adult confidence and the importance of teamwork, all tied together in this amazing story. Although some of the climactic fight scenes do go on for quite a while (an endemic problem in the super hero genre) it doesn't take away from the film's impact.I recommend seeing this on as big a medium as possible. Even though it's an animation film, watching this for the first time on your phone would be a mistake. The visuals are so intense, sometimes overpowering, that you want to get the full effect. A great film for children but with plenty of adult wisdom, this one is not to be missed. Highly recommended.",10,0,1,11 May 2019
Collateral," Solid film.
","This is Michael Mann's best recent movie. He can still do something that just draws you in and holds your attention throughout. That is what 'Collateral' does. The movie shoots off the moment Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx link up.As for the principals, Foxx is the one who does best. One wonders why this performance wasn't also nominated for an Oscar. His cab driver, Max's shift from submissiveness to heroism is completely believable. He is every bit the frightened victim of circumstance and the defiant everyman put together.Tom Cruise, although a little bit less convincing, fills the role effectively. His total and utter lack of remorse and human empathy turns Vincent into a monster that the audience only fears and roots against. Except for his incongruous gray hair contrasted with his still fairly-boyish looks, Cruise's work here is totally on the mark.As good as this movie is, 'Heat' (1995) is even better- and more realistic. That's a movie in which the police are just as smart as the bad guys, and professional criminals are defeated by law enforcement, not by a guy on the street.",9,2,3,7 April 2005
Dunkirk," Extraordinarily tense war film told through individual stories
","Although touched upon in some films in the past, the British-French evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 as France neared total collapse at the hands of the Germany Army in WWII has never been given the kind of comprehensive and vivid treatment that Nolan's explosive war film does.This film fully captures the anxiety, desperation and seeming hopelessness that the British Army faced in its efforts to save its troops in France and prepare to defend their own soil as Hitler's armies defeated the French and overran the European mainland. It does so by giving the audience a close-up of the evacuation from as many vantage points as possible. These include the British troops trying to cross the English Channel (told from both masses and a small group) as well as civilians who used their own vessels to aid a depleted British Navy in rescuing the troops and from the air in which British spitfire pilots fought gallantly to protect British ships and troops from German aircraft and finally from the British high command desperately trying to pull off a miracle.In the air strike scenes, Nolan makes the screaming sound of a German dive bomber as menacing and tension-inducing as any director has done in recent memory. The tension is amplified to a raw crescendo by Hans Zimmer's brilliantly realized soundtrack. Equally impressive is the sense of dread created in individual troops trying to escape but facing one seemingly fatal catastrophe after another. As far as performances go, this isn't any one actor's film, though everyone is great with exceptional work by Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Mark Rylance. Tom Hardy has a fairly important role though he spends most of the film muzzled by a fighter pilot mask. The film's achievement lies in creating a wide-ranging account of courage, sacrifice and perseverance in the face of almost-certain disaster. It doesn't offer much speechifying or jingoistic sentiments, just the hard-boiled realism of war.The story of a hardened and weary army trying to escape to defend its own shores might not resonate right away with audiences unfamiliar with the war, but this film is a lot more than just a mere depiction of history. It's also a master class in dramatic spectacle and the recreation of an epic tale of survival in a war that at that moment seemed likely to end very soon. Splendidly realized, it is not to be missed.",9,5,12,26 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Gigantic, layered, massively crowded Avengers conclusion is lumbering but hard to dislike
","The long-awaited conclusion to the Marvel's Avengers film franchise puts everything in perspective from the previous installments. If you are a diehard MCU devotee, this film will likely be your must-see of the year. For the disengaged or the downright uninitiated, this is actually not bad.Although clearly aiming for the franchise to hit the highest of highs in terms of catharsis, the film's emotional impact is diluted by its sheer size. The many, many different characters are utterly dwarfed by the film's enormous scope. The good news is, the story is a straightforward battle of good and evil with very little in the way of divided loyalties or moral quandaries. But there are so many players and so many backstories to tie together, that you could be forgiven for feeling more relief than a visceral thrill when it's all said and done.On the plus side, there is a stirring musical score and a heartfelt ending that will put all doubts about the film's soulfulness to rest. Although the Avengers franchise in its totality isn't quite my cup of tea, I recommend this as solid, quality entertainment.",7,1,4,16 June 2019
Toy Story 4," Wonderfully enjoyable Toy Story sequel
","If you have any uncertainty about the durability of 'Toy Story' as a film franchise, this sequel should put your doubts to rest. It's a splendid continuation of the saga of Woody and Company as he and his fellow toys adjust to a new era as the toys of Andy's child, Bonnie, and the introduction of a new type of toy into their world, Forky.On a family road trip, Woody and the other toys come to grips with how their purpose has changed in a new lifetime as toys. They find answers in unexpected places as they cross paths with other toys in their journey. It's a touching and wholesome story that is surprisingly thought-provoking and insightful. I wish all animation films could be like this.Those of us who have watched Woody and his fellow toys through the years can be grateful for this chapter, a rewarding experience. Recommended to the highest degree to viewers of all ages.",10,1,3,23 July 2019
The Favourite," Vicious, bawdy tale of a queen's court
","Yorgos Lanthimos takes on the biopic genre in this serpentine and visually striking depiction of Queen Anne in her diminished condition and her shifting companionship between Lady Sarah, who largely took over the reigns of the state and Abigail, a young woman who comes to the court as a servant but quickly earns the queen's fondness. Abigail becomes a foil not only for Lady Sarah but for the male leaders in Parliament.Emma Watson and Rachel Weisz play well off each other as Abigail and Lady Sarah respectively. Olivia Coleman is a joy to watch as the frail but furiously combustible Queens Anne. Nicholas Hoult is solid in a supporting turn as the leader of Parliament opposition.The film is loaded with Lanthimosian dark humor but also cold mystery and austere cinematography and camerawork. In time, we get to know the quirks, hidden secrets and impulses of all three characters as the court confronts the pressures of war with France and political instability at home- and more privately as the queen's closest female confidants duel for their place.One of Lanthimos's best films to date, this one will keep you on the edge until the very last frame with one memorable sequence after another. Recommended to the highest degree.",10,24,53,2 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino film on Hollywood, dreamlike, fiery... and long
","I usually see a film knowing as little as possible because I find it helps maximize the film's impact. Quentin Tarantino's latest epic recreation (and desecration) of history proves to be the exception. It pays to read up on this film's essential story especially if you had not been born yet when it all takes place.Which is not to say the film isn't arresting and captivating even if you don't know all the players. But it will seem interminable, maybe even aimless at times if you don't know where Tarantino is going. Some of it will be obvious to younger viewers, the rest of it no so much. But I highly recommend knowing the lay of the land before going to see this. Otherwise, you're more likely to feel the running time of this film.In terms of performances, Leonardo DiCaprio is quite good as a fading Hollywood actor who is grasping at straws to revive his career, but here he is out-acted by a considerable margin by Brad Pitt who turns in a charismatic performance as the actor's stunt double and driver. Margot Robbie is an appealing presence as the young, up-and-coming actress Sharon Tate. Al Pacino and Kurt Russell are both a joy to watch in small roles that add spice and backstory to the proceedings.As a director, Tarantino has a recurring issue with his films rarely getting sufficient cutting room time, and here it's no exception. Although I would have preferred a tighter film, the gripping closing act erases most of the flaws and ends on a bittersweet note, leaving us with a truly surreal film experience, that is a feather in the cap of everyone involved. All it could have used was a real editor. Recommended.",7,7,9,28 July 2019
Get Out," Not really a horror film, more like a thriller with a very insolent sense of humor
","Having heard nothing but raves about this film and how scary it is, I caught its return to the theaters. For starters, I'll say this. Get past the first 15-20 minutes, because initially it comes across as cartoonish and obvious and gives no indication of how clever and brash it's going to become. But a sharp soundtrack early on gives a hint of something to come.This mystery story of a young couple, black man and his white girlfriend meeting the latter's parents in their suburban house quickly sheds its cookie cutter aura and becomes something brazen and ominous as the family members are introduced. The film pulls no punches in landing one stereotypcial gag after another. If you're a politically correct individual who cannot stand any kind of racially-charged digs, this film isn't for you. I found the jokes to be so shameless and the satire so biting, that it made a film about race relations in this day and age seem almost carefree. And although it does have some isolated horror elements, this is a suspense film through and through.Don't get me wrong. The humor aside, this movie is not afraid to get its hands dirty. But the outrage is really on mute. This is not the kind of film that should stir up strong emotions for the simple reason that it's so escapist and cheerfully juvenile. At the same time, despite its sheer style and witty screenplay, I don't see this film winning Best Picture. Happily recommended.",8,20,39,15 February 2018
A Quiet Place," Creepy suspense monster thriller that you see with the masses
","Normally when I see a film in theaters, the audience can sometimes be a liability. You want to appreciate the film as it is on screen and have zero interest in its impact on other people watching. Enter this film, which proves to be the exception.It is the story of a family trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world torn apart by predatory aliens who hunt based on their extreme hearing capacity. The oldest child in the family just happens to be deaf. It's an imaginative premise that is extremely well-executed by Krasinski. I dare say it's the most creative suspense film I have seen in recent memory.A popcorn suspense thriller with this much tension can only be appreciated for its full effect when you see its power on a crowd of viewers. This film kept everyone in, well, complete and utter silence throughout until its gripping conclusion. You cannot ask for much more than that from a film of this genre. I give Krasinski a world of credit in putting together a master class in suspense.Acknowledging the film's nasty foibles and tricks, however, I also have to admit that it does not shy away from having its characters make stupid mistakes or show a marked lack of judgment in key moments. This is an easy ploy that lots of horror and suspense thrillers use, but here it doesn't detract from the film's achievement too much.I recommend that this film be watched in theaters, and seen with a large crowd, the best setting in which its impact can be strongly felt.",7,2,5,19 May 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Summer love discovered, explored and never forgotten
","I am usually quick to start focusing on the next film as soon as I've finished one, but here is a rare exception that I prefer to let linger on for a while even at the risk of my memory of it becoming unremarkable. That's because it's one of the most subtly affecting and beautiful love stories that I've seen in years. A low-key pace and a sumptuous musical score build the film to a conclusion that is truly flawless.The story is of a young American graduate student who stays with a professor in his country house in Italy in the summer of 1983 and slowly develops an intimate relationship with the professor's precocious 17-year-old son. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer are both brilliant in this film as the two who find companionship in an unexpected place, and Michael Stuhlbarg is wonderful as the professor. The young man and the teenage boy do not interact much at first, mostly because the young man appears detached and unresponsive. But I would be loath to reveal too much after that. Let's just say it's a film that one should absorb slowly and let its quiet power take hold. It's a film that truly captures some wonderful truths about the human condition, about the emotional toll of relationships and about how much one's secrets shape one's dynamic with others.In terms of cinematography, there is much of the Italian countryside to marvel at. It makes that country seem like one of the most blissful and sublime places in the world to visit. History buffs and linguists will find some welcome material in the professor's dialogues with his graduate student to enjoy. As quiet and austere as the film may be at times, it contains a deeper passion that gradually gets tapped into and colors the mindset despite the taboo nature of the material. Never long or protracted, it will keep you guessing until the end and just leave a haunting feeling after it's over. Gladly recommended to anyone in search of true cinema.",9,16,26,2 December 2017
1917," Stirring WWI film, deeply affecting and quietly anguished
","A war that is now a century old (and therefore no longer widely understood) is vividly captured in this stunning dramatization by Sam Mendes. It portrays the journey of two British infantrymen who are tasked with the near-impossible assignment of alerting another unit of an approaching trap. The one-take film focuses on their grueling slog across no-man's land to the other unit's location. Along the way, their path encounters many instances of danger and surprise.Not always easy on the senses- in fact rarely so- this film gives one a first-person perspective on how hellish and miserable this war was. And although the story is about this particular conflict, one gets the sense that many of the realities of war in this film are still applicable today, a century later. That's what makes this such a startling film experience. As for Roger Deakins' cinematography, it is every bit as breathtaking as one would anticipate from him. Highly recommended to those who are familiar with this part of history and to anyone who has served in combat and who would know the horrors that are portrayed here. And recommended to everyone else.",10,12,24,30 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Solid Star Wars entry, even if a bit spread out
","This longish Star Wars chapter featuring the Resistance's desperate fight for survival against the pursuing First Order holds up well enough on a second viewing. It has much to recommend it, especially since it makes better use of Oscar Isaac than 'The Force Awakens' did and offers a final moving turn by Carrie Fischer. Her presence in this film is greatly appreciated and she offers some of the best moments.My biggest criticism of this Star Wars entry is that it could have had a tighter storyline. As it is, it spreads its synopsis far and wide, diluting its impact. Its division among several differing story threads got to me and kept this film from being even stronger. But in the end, I can't criticize any Star Wars film that more fully fleshes out Kylo Ren's backstory and gives us an awe-inspiring return by none other than Luke Skywalker, who has become reclusive and detached from the Force. Some simmering themes of loyalty, inner conflict and the corrupting influence of power and well-explored in this installment.Daisy Ridley is initially unremarkable here but her presence builds as her storyline becomes one of the stronger parts of the film. Benicio Del Toro is very loose and funny in his wild card role. John Boyega is somewhat weakly utilized here and he's at the center of a key battle scene that I thought ended up as a missed opportunity. However, it's still a well-executed saga that will keep you gripped until the very end. Gladly recommended to both Star Wars fans and novices alike.",8,1,3,31 December 2017
Cold War," Polish drama flirts with greatness, undermined by a shocking and senseless conclusion
","I have never seen a film capture the desolate despair of Eastern Europe after the Second World War as in this case. This film offers a beguiling tale of a middle-aged Polish musician who travels to a feudal area and becomes infatuated with an aspiring female singer who is among the peasant folk who audition to perform for his company. The two fall for each other and their love blossoms into a perpetual romance that survives many upheavals including the company being taken over by Stalinist ideologues and the man's decision to leave Poland for western Europe.Performances here are extraordinary by the two leads. They present a compelling and sympathetic couple who can't stay way from one another despite marked differences in their character. She as it turns out comes from a troubled family. He is an old soul who finds rejuvenation in a woman so combustible and unpredictable. It's one of those romances whose imperfections make it the perfect love story.Alas, we have this film's conclusion. I cannot abide a film's resolution that does not conform to the character arc. If there is insufficient character development or plotting for the climax that takes place, then the ending will only take away from the film's logic. That is what happens here; the resolution robs the film of its greatness because it is so senseless. I still recommend this as a film experience, but its ultimate achievement is very debatable.",7,3,8,29 December 2018
Logan," Gripping Wolverine saga
","This incredible entry into the Wolverine series envisions Logan in his aging, decaying state in a bleak, dystopian future in which the mutants have become a dying species. Logan must find a way to adapt in his diminished condition. It's a blistering installment in which Hugh Jackman gives his absolute all.Although the screenplay here does have some occasional lulls, they are exceedingly rare, as the film regularly picks up the pace again and reverts to being the rip-roaring thrill ride that it opens up as. A sense of dread creeps throughout the film even when the soundtrack seems peaceful. You never feel in a completely safe place here, which is what gives it its intense edge.This film makes no bones about the violence quotient. My friend who saw it with me described it as 'unpleasant' which made me laugh. It's certainly not for the squeamish but if you enjoy fierce action sequences, you will love this film. It's an unusual superhero action flick that overcomes the conventions of its genre and becomes something more serious and much more painstaking than what we in this generation have come to expect. This film's appeal goes beyond its hero's reliable fan base. Strongly recommended.",8,2,6,15 March 2017
Hotel Mumbai," Startling terrorism drama will test your nerves
","The 2008 Jihadist attack on the prestigious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai is vividly recaptured in this film. A group of young Muslims recruited out of desperate poverty are sent on a mission to attack various prominent targets in the city one of which is the vast and labyrinthine hotel. As this ghastly event unfolds, hotel staff and guests alike are forced to adopt their own survival instincts as Mumbai has only a minimally-armed local police force and no military presence close by.I was struck by how this thus-far underrated film portrays terrorism and its unyielding thirst for blood. It's both fascinating and disturbing how such a young group of people could be driven to such a mindless excursion of unbridled rage and savage violence. That aspect of the film was extraordinary. There are strong performances throughout the film. Dev Patel is a waiter who is raising a young family in the city. Anupam Kher is a head chef with strict standards for his staff. Armie Hammer and Nazinin Boniadi are a young married couple with their infant child and babysitter. Jason Isaacs gives a scene-stealing performance as a Russian businessman. A plush hotel becomes the venue of a vicious attack and ensuing battle for survival.Very well-directed and amply suspenseful, this film might be at times a bit punishing to sit through, but it's not without moments of heroism and humor. The intensity level puts you right there and makes you feel like one of those desperately trying to escape. Although it's not for the faint of heart, anyone who watches will be in awe. Strongly recommended as a memorable film experience.",9,23,73,31 March 2019
The Shape of Water," Enchanting fantasy romance, full of wonder
","Although far from flawless, Del Toro's fantasy drama about a mute woman and her unexpected romance with a creature captured from the Amazon by the U.S. government is endearing and sad at the same time. It's a story about two members of divergent species who meet one another by chance and develop a romantic spark. These two beings come to find solace and bliss in each other's company in a world that is cold and heartless. It's a more modern spin on 'Beauty and the Beast' and it's well worth seeing.The biggest stumbling block the film has to overcome is a claustrophobic feeling that settles in after a certain point. The trailers made this look like a great adventure, but it's actually a desperate fight for survival against daunting odds, but one that is riveting. The film is beautifully shot, has a sterling throwback soundtrack and a beguiling storyline milieu. The creature itself is not depicted as a soft cuddly thing at all times, refreshingly. In some instances, it can be quite menacing. Del Toro's realization of this monster-cum-paramour is both wondrous and complex.Sally Hawkins is utterly splendid as the mute woman who works in a smallish maintenance position at the government facility where the creature is quarantined. Michael Shannon is well-deployed as the government official who views the creature as nothing more than an experiment to be learned from. Michael Stuhlberg is also effective as one of the chief scientists at the lab. And Octavia Spencer, as always, is fun to watch here. The only weak link is Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbor. There's something annoyingly saccharine about his performance and the film winds up having to overcome it, which it does.There might be some larger metaphors in this film about race and religion, but I would leave that open to interpretation. This is a poignant story in its own right, and one that will stay with you, regardless of what else Del Toro might be trying to say. Gladly recommended.",8,26,46,10 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," Hilarious portrayal of epic filmmaker eccentricity
","The story of the making of the film 'The Room' is brilliantly realized in this biopic directed by James Franco. It's the story of the making of the one of worst critically-received films in memory. Franco impeccably stars as Tommy Wiseau, the mysterious aspiring Hollywood star who in the late 90s, no one had ever heard of and almost everyone avoided once they saw him except, Greg Sestero, a young aspiring actor (Dave Franco who is wonderfully sympathetic) who meets Wiseau in San Francisco in 1998.The two realize early on that the odds are overwhelmingly against them in getting anyone in the industry to take them seriously or give them the time of day, so they embark on their own project to make their own movie with a script that Wiseau has written. Wiseau also directs the film, which turns out to be a unique experience for everyone involved.No other film this year made me laugh as hard as this one. It's beyond hilarious how peculiar and unconventional Wiseau's filmmaking style comes across. His oddities just jump out at you like no other, but in an endearing way. Despite its comedic aspect, this film never intends to ridicule or make fun of Wiseau but instead seeks to portray him as an artist who had nothing but an honest-to-goodness belief in the work he was doing and devout faith that it would be recognized. It's a story that is too poignant to pass up. Recommended to the highest degree.",10,1,2,31 December 2017
American Made," Mundane, misbegotten Tom Cruise rejuvenation vehicle
","How many more of these boy-wonder performances is Cruise going to give before he finally acquiesces to something more... normal? Don't get me wrong, he still comes across as youthful and dynamic on-screen despite being well into his 50s. But if you've followed his career for decades, this kind of film becomes something of a fraud on his part. Generally, I'd rather watch a bona fide young actor make the endeavor in the type of performances Cruise continues to strive for even though he's now within shouting distance of 60. Because Cruise is an age-battling Hollywood movie star, his presence lacks depth. Notwithstanding the film's brisk, carefree tenor, it's a stunning miscasting.In this film, Cruise attempts to give a performance as Barry Seal, the TWA pilot who quickly becomes a hired gun for the CIA in the drug smuggling era involving the South American drug cartels and the Sandinistas. He basically flies loads and loads of drugs into the United States and in the process becomes a very rich man. He works for the CIA and provides a service to the drug lords. It's fairly interesting and decently executed for a while. Domhnall Gleeson is the bright spot in this film as the shadowy CIA operative who becomes Cruise's demanding, unapologetic boss.But maybe the filmmakers should have done their homework before putting this together because Cruise, evidently trying to capture a young protagonist, doesn't look anything like the corpulent Seal. Ironically, this miscasting makes Cruise's effort even more ridiculous. Not only was Seal not as athletic as Cruise, he wasn't particularly youthful-looking either. This central misrepresentation is really what kills the film, not to mention a relatively rote screenplay that we've come across a million times before. None of this is going to be too egregious to most viewers. Many people would probably never even know who Barry Seal was, if not for this film. Still, it's kind of silly for Cruise to continue to perpetuate a desperate jump into the fountain of youth in a role that doesn't even call for it that much. But perhaps stardom is the ultimate source of self-delusion. Not recommended.",5,7,14,16 October 2017
Mudbound," Slog through this mud only if you have to
","I can best describe this Netflix film as highly uneven and frustrating to watch. Know this, you will feel the running time here because the film often loses its narrative grip and takes a while to get going again. Although handsomely shot, well-acted and possessing a powerful story at its core, this work nevertheless is too bloated and at times too aimless to leave a lasting impression. I've already forgotten the several stretches here in which seemingly nothing happened.A melodrama about a white family and a black family on a Mississippi farm before, during and after the Second World War is a well-intended premise, but this film definitely could have used more editing. The characters are introduced quite well and there are some genuinely well-executed scenes, especially the heart-wrenching climax. But getting there takes so long and during these intervals I was wondering what the whole point of it was. Another sign that the story was not told very well: I actually forgot that the farm was struggling until one of the characters mentioned it. An important plot thread like that wound up feeling more like a footnote.Some of the performances, although high quality, are wasted. Carey Mulligan is the best example of this. She starts out as a relatively central protagonist before fading into the background. In the end, she's an ill-defined character. Jason Clarke starts out strong, but he's also something of an afterthought by the end. On the plus side, Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell play well off each other as two war veterans who come to grips with the institutional racism of 1940s Mississippi and who both realize that life was, in some ways, better in the military. Jonathan Banks gives a committed performance as the aging grandfather who deplores any indication of social change.But despite the strong performances, this is a film I would only remember as one that took long to get through. To put it bluntly, I was snookered by the reviews. They praised this film as brilliant and I bought it, hook, line and sinker. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this film because then I would be joining them in that lie.",5,33,65,26 November 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Does Kenneth Branagh think he's Baz Luhrmann?
","The most conspicuous aspect of this misfire is that right out of gate, it comes at you with full force, over-the-top, fake-looking performances. It's the kind of rare style that very few directors, let alone films can do to good effect. It was like 'Moulin Rouge' only not done well. It poked me in the eye in that regard. And it made me wonder just what Branagh's intentions were with this version of Agatha Christie's novel. Was he trying to make it more light-hearted? More comical? More campy? In the end, he only succeeded for sure in making it more boring.A film that goes from absurd to dull will not earn much recognition for anything other the sheer acting talent that it wastes. Michelle Pfieffer and Willem Dafoe are both slumming it in this dreck. Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz are the only ones who don't embarrass themselves here but then their screen time is short. I've seen worse films in my life, but this one gets a big thumbs down and is not recommended.",4,2,7,11 November 2017
Parasite," Explosive crime and class warfare film, funny and suspenseful
","Bong Joon Ho's film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing, mischievous energy and spiked with sharply-drawn characters, with varying shades of moral and ethical decay. It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns.It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat.Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever.For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended.",10,14,23,15 November 2019
Marriage Story," Adult drama on divorce, elevated by two incredible lead performances
","Noah Baumbach's down-to-earth take on the pitfalls of divorce for two young parents is bolstered by emotionally weighty performances by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, both of whom do some of their best work ever here. There is also a strong supporting cast, including Julie Hagerty as Johansson's mother, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta who both give witty performances as the jousting divorce attorneys on opposites sides.The film's emotional labyrinth is gradually negotiated by the two leads and includes a pained, stately soundtrack that hits all the right notes. Another plus is the film's lush cinematography that gives an unhappy story a surprisingly sunny aura. Even though we are watching two people during the worst period in their lives, the world around them seems comforting and warm.Usually, Baumbach's filmmaking style can be very blunt, sometimes even downright tactless. But here, his signature tone feels right at home as he portrays the frustration, heartbreak and fury that is the battle of wills of two people struggling to reach one another. It's not always easy to watch but it will leave a mark. As tough as this is to digest, it's still a work of excellence. Strongly recommended.",8,78,142,15 November 2019
Black Panther," Visually splendid, thought-provoking Marvel blockbuster
","The fight for the crown of Wakanda is wonderfully brought to life in this bristling film about T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and his rise to power as king of Wakanda in the aftermath of returning to his home country and his subsequent struggle for his position when he is challenged by his rival Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan in an authoritative performance) whose father was killed by accident by his father a generation earlier.First, the extraordinary visual effects. This sheer visual aspect of the film held my attention before I was sold on the film's underlying story. Even if you don't go for this sort of movie as a genre, you should nevertheless see it because its visuals demand being seen on screen. The film's stunning and lush realization of Wakanda alone is worth the price of admission.Then, there is the powerful story of two viciously competing visions for the place of Wakanda in the world and confronting injustice and oppression against its people. This film becomes a surprisingly gripping debate between confrontation and pragmatism, between vindictiveness and conciliation. Killmonger and T'Challa come to epitomize the conflicting philosophies battling for the leadership of Wakanda. In that regard, it's a great political Marvel film as well.I was impressed by how the whole cast gave this film so much vitality. Although Michael B. Jordan is somewhat underused in the beginning, his presence becomes more paramount and he shapes the film more and more as it goes along. Boseman is tremendously heroic and sympathetic in the title role. This is a Marvel blockbuster to remember when the dust settles. Strongly recommended.",8,2,8,20 February 2018
Mother!," Aronofsky exceeded my expectations with this extraordinary, satanic film
","I had no idea of the magnitude of what I was in for with this film. I went in knowing as little as possible. The trailers convey so little of what this is, and that's definitely for the better. It's one of those films that sneaks up on you and becomes something so monstrous, startling and impactful that you can't remember the last time a film struck you that way and you also might wonder if you'll ever have a cinematic experience like it ever again. It left me speechless for two days before I could review it.Jennifer Lawrence gives an uncharacteristically innocent and vulnerable performance here, one of her best ever. Javier Bardem is magnetic as her older husband. They live together in a secluded pastoral house when their privacy is soon encroached upon by an uncouth Ed Harris and an odious Michelle Pfieffer. To reveal more would be to give away a bit too much. Let's just say it builds into something allegorical in a way that you just don't see coming. I would argue the best way to prepare for this film is to read as few reviews as possible and just go in cold.Out of respect for the squeamish and even those not all that squeamish, I will warn you there is a moment of undeniable barbarism near the end, and possibly the biggest reason this film is so virulently hated by some. But other than that, there is not much to be offended by. The work of this filmmaker is academic and metaphorical. Nothing is spelled out, nor should it be. It's a film that is open to several different interpretations, which obviously depend on what you find. Like I said, it's best to just go in cold and emerge with a foundation upon which to parse Aronofsky's stunning creativity that takes place here.There are moments when the film's excesses might seem preposterous but once you understand that the film's events are meant to stand for something much more universal, the excesses are no longer a flaw but rather a detail that is captured in the filmmaker's sweeping, devilish brush. What humanity has done to the world and what its fate might be in turn, is the biggest question ever grappled with by Aronofsky. He has done it before but not like this. From a distance, this film might look entertaining but also conventional. It is considerably more than that. Bravely recommended to everyone and to the highest degree.",9,6,17,19 September 2017
Life," Woefully inert sci-fi horror vehicle
","Although visually sophisticated and compact in its running time, this very generic film sinfully wastes its formidable A-list cast. The storyline here gets little or no development and therefore offers little or no reason to care about the agreeable but nondescript international space crew that confronts the realities of extraterrestrial life.Ryan Reynolds makes his best effort here as an engineer with a sardonic edge. Biggest shocker: Jake Gyllenhaal manages to be boring. I never thought I'd say that about one of his performances. Rebecca Ferguson has virtually nothing to work with and the rest of the cast is all but muzzled in this cookie-cutter, throwaway screenplay. Visual splendor does make this nice to look at, but that's where the excellence stops.Although this lethargic, mostly non-scary film does go on to finish strong, it is too little, too late and does not elevate this above standard fare. Genre fans might feel let down the most. Not recommended.",5,4,11,29 March 2017
Green Book," Decent, enjoyable but standard prestige film based on a true story
","Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give stellar performances in this true story about a NYC club employee and bodyguard who is hired by a classical pianist from Carnegie Hall to drive him through his performance tour across the South in the early 1960s, during which they develop a solid bond, despite their considerable educational and socioeconomic differences.I would call this film decent, light entertainment. It definitely offers a glimpse into how impressive Mortensen's range is an actor. The same actor who gave compelling performances in films like 'A Dangerous Method' and 'Captain Fantastic' is thoroughly riveting to watch here as he disappears into the role of 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga and Ali is impressive as Don Shirley, a Jamaican-American musician who became well-known in his era.This film doesn't break too much ground, in all honesty. It's good diverting cinema but as a film released during Oscar season, it's fairly run-of-the-mill with no real surprises. But I do give Peter Farrelly a lot of credit for stepping out of his usual repertoire and giving us a different genre to look at within his filmography. Recommended.",7,2,6,30 November 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Spike Lee joint on Vietnam, incendiary and cathartic
","Even if Spike Lee's unapologetically political style of filmmaking is not your cup of tea, his new film about four Vietnam veterans returning to their old battleground in search of gold that they came across on the tour of duty might be worth viewing. They are also intent on recovering the remains of their fierce commanding officer who motivated and inspired them. The story is spiked with powerful performances all around (led by an explosive Delroy Lindo) and laced with viscerally taut action sequences and a sterling soundtrack.The timeliness of the film's message couldn't be better. The rage over how black America bore a disproportionate human cost in fighting the war in Vietnam, while at the same time African-Americans struggled to reach anything approaching societal and legal equality back home is balanced by a pained but ironclad belief in the undying honor of military service and loyalty to one's country. The film also has a 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre' feel when it tackles themes of friendship, family and hunting for gold.Although not always smooth, with an occasional narrative drift and a late undisciplined lapse into preachiness, the film has an awful lot to say about the overlap between United States foreign policy missteps and social injustice at home. Not all the main characters are given a solid introduction and backstory, but their group dynamic becomes quite clear. The actual war experience for these men is never conveyed in-depth, except in occasional flashbacks. Despite these flaws, this film has many suspenseful, poignant and hard-hitting moments. You will barely notice the running time. It's a punch in the gut, as it touches on several unpleasant truths about American history and goes down as one of Spike Lee's more challenging films. Recommended to those who are open-minded.",8,13,27,14 June 2020
Annihilation," Unreal, insane journey into the metaphysical
","Alex Garland has given us quite a memorable piece of cinema with this new sci-fi/horror work. The storyline centers around a former soldier-turned-academic who ventures into a scientifically mystifying and inscrutable zone of supernatural activity in the aftermath of her husband's troubled return from a mission into that area, which has been festering and expanding for years. She joins a group of fellow scientists/military personnel in the hopes of finally ascertaining just what the zone is and what goes on inside it.Natalie Portman is terrific as the biologist whose core motivation is understanding just what happened to her husband (Oscar Isaac in a small but effective role). Jennifer Jason Leigh is compelling as a psychologist who is in charge of the mission that Portman joins. She is iron-willed in the face of a zone that becomes more dangerous and terrifying as the mission progresses. Strong supporting performances from Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson add to the mix. In the process of the mission, questions of ethics, existentialism and the human condition are raised, albeit tangentially. Human frailty and its occasional conflict with scientific understanding also comes into play.I found this film extremely compelling and even if some scenes were a bit protracted, it didn't take away from the film's effect or achievement. The exquisite visuals contrast sharply with spare but ferocious moments of brutality. It epitomizes a world that science knows quite well- the wonder and the horror of our existence and how we are sometimes left with more questions than answers. The film's vision of scientific rules being bent is imaginative but not overindulgent. Viewers who prefer something concrete and definitive in its storytelling might not take to this, but for those who like a film that raises challenging issues and is alternately placid and scary, I highly recommend this.Postscript: I would advise the studio that produced this film to not conspicuously advertise the fact that it is already being released on Netflix. In my view, that really cheapens the release and makes it look like a made-for-television movie, which it is not. There is a definite audience for this, but perhaps not the masses.",9,2,5,18 March 2018
