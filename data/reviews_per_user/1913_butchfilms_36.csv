Requiem for a Dream," I found it very boring, I only liked the final part
","I know that 'Requiem for a Dream' is an important movie because it shows what could happen when people take drugs.I think this movie should be shown in the high schools all over the world so the teenagers realize what could be the consequences of consuming drugs.Having said that I found the movie very boring and very slow except for the last twentysomething minutes where the movie is really good. I think this movie deserves 7.5 stars (only for the final part) but not 8.5 and less being between the top 100 IMDb list so I give it a 1.I liked the performances of the four main characters. I know the director made most part of the movie very slow so that the final part had a major impact in the audience, and he was right but the problem is that I almost stop watching the movie because it was very boring, I only watched it until the end because I had rented it otherwise I had stopped watching the movie and changed the channel.",1,5,10,30 October 2008
Marie Antoinette," some entertaining characters but at the end BORING
","I saw this movie because I like the work of Kirsten Dunst and because I wanted to learn a little more of the life of Marie Antoinette, but I regret I saw it because it was to long and boring. I think this film deserves 5.5 star.At the beginning it seems that this is going to be an interesting movie, but as the minutes pass it diminish a lot. Kirsten Dunst is OK as Marie Antoinette, well in general the performances are good. The movie looks great it seems like we are seeing real people of that era. what I didn't like was that the character of Louis XVI was played like a caricature. I think it would have been much better if it would have lasted just 100 minutes instead of 123, because it has many boring moments and its pace is too slow. I would have liked to see more of the characters of Comtesse du Barry. and Comtesse de Noailles which I found interesting and funny. In this film we see Marie Antoinette since her arrival to France to marry Louis XVI, her life like the queen of France until her exit from palace with her family because of the french revolution.This movie is recommended only for women. And if you are a man only watch it if you are a Kirsten Dunst's die hard fan",5,1,2,8 February 2009
Minority Report," Interesting film
","This movie has a smart plot and good performances. Tom Cruise is very good as the Chief John Anderton. The strength of the film is that it put in doubt that people's fate is already written and can't be changed.Even though I liked 'Minority Report' I still think that it could have been much better in a more entertaining way, I am not saying that this is a boring movie, not at all, I mean that its biggest problem is that it last too much (145 minutes), because of that there are certain parts that are a little boring. I think that 2 hours would have been perfect. Other thing I didn't like was the lack of colors of the shots, they look too dark.The plot is about Chief John Anderton who catches future killers before they murder thanks to 3 people who see the murders in their dreams before they are done , but one day John Anderton see in their dreams that he is one of the killers who will commit a murder. Is it true or is it a set up?, that is what he has to find out with the police after him.I recommend to see it by its special effects and smart plot.",7,0,2,21 December 2008
Training Day," Denzel Washington is excellent as Alonzo, a tough street wise cop
","What a great movie. I would put this movie between the best movies for men besides 'the good, the bad and the ugly', 'pulp fiction', 'die hard 1 & 2' and 'predator'. Denzel Washington's performance as a tough cop Alonzo is terrific. For me there are just 2 movies 'pulp fiction' and 'training day' that have made me feel an exciting fast ride sensation since the first minute until the end.The plot is about the first day of work of a rookie policeman called Jake (Ethan Hawke)who have to learn about the job from a tough street wise cop named Alonzo. During the day Jake is surprised how Alonzo handles different police's situations in a not by the book way, but Alonzo tells him this is how things are done in the field because you have to be a wolf in order to protect the sheep. Will Jake agree with Alonzo's methods to do the job?..... I think a 7.5 is the correct grade for 'training day' for its worth as a movie, but i give it a 10 because of the emotion that made me feel despite its common Hollywood's final. I think if this movie would have had a more realistic final part, 'training day' would be considered one of the great movies of the decade and not just as a good action movie. This is one of my all time favorite movies.",10,2,5,14 October 2008
Dawn of the Dead," just a satisfactory terror action movie
","this is a terror action movie that is just satisfactory, we have watched many movies like this before and i can say that it doesn't give us new things. the beginning of the movie offers a biggest expectation of what it finally delivers. i am not saying that this is a bad movie, but i would recommend to the general public watching this movie just if this is on TV unless u are a really fan of this kind of terror action films.the movie is about a group of people who try to survive in a mall the attacks of an epidemic that makes alive to dead people, and this living dead beings try to bite the normal people to turn them in one of themselves.",6,0,0,12 October 2008
Seven Years in Tibet," I liked the first half of the film the most
","I found the first half of the movie very interesting and entertaining when the Heinrich character is climbing and when he is wandering around the Tibet (a film for at least 7 stars), but once Pitt's character gets to the city of Lhasa the film begins to diminish in being entertaining and becomes more a regular feel good movie which is not as interesting as it was at the beginning, even though is not so bad either. I have to say that the photography of this film is great.Heinrich Harrer (Pitt) is an Austrian mountaineer who leaves his pregnant wife in Austria in 1939 in order to climb the Nanga Parbat in India but once there he is going to be arrested with his team mates because Germany attacked Poland (WW2) , he will get to escape with a team mate and his way of seeing life will change forever when they get to the city of Lhasa Â…..6 stars = regular",6,0,1,12 April 2009
Superbad," 'Super Bad' is very funny, but had the potential to be a great movie too
","'Super Bad' is great until the moment the two policemen appears, from that scene it stop being clever to become just a funny movie that is only looking for the easy laugh (like most of the comedies we are used to watch), that is not a bad thing, I like that kind of comedy too, but the problem is that 'Super Bad' promised much more of what it finally delivers, it could been the best teen boys comedy movie ever, which dealt with the boys interest in the opposite sex. I think this movie deserves an average of 6.8 stars.The star of the film is Jonah Hill who is very good as the smart ass Seth (who is very funny making jokes and comments), on the other hand I didn't like the character Evan, this character is so annoying (he could haven been made not so naive). Christopher Mintz-Plasse was great playing the Fogell character, I enjoyed every moment he was on screen because he is very funny in a rare way like mr bean.The plot is about two best friends Seth and Evan with a secondary character Fogell who have their last chance to lose their virginity at a party before going to the university. They will have to face problems taking a lot of beer to the party in order to have sex with pretty girls.I recommend watching it because is very funny, despite the two policemen characters who are funny too but the didn't belong to this film. Enjoy it.",6,3,6,28 December 2008
The Hustler," This is not just a movie about pool, 'The Hustler' is a movie about life
","This is the best movie where Paul Newman is the star. Paul Newman has been the star of great movies like: Hud, Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (my favorite movie) and The Sting (the last 2 along with Robert Redford), but no one has the strength and realism of 'the hustler' that made of Paul Newman a movie star and being considered as the new Marlon Brando. Paul Newman made the character of Eddie Felson his, and not for a moment I thought I was watching Paul acting, I was watching Eddie Felson going through life from city to city, from pool to pool hustling people making a living like many lonely hustlers in the world.The plot of the movie is about Eddie Felson, a pool hustler, who comes to New York to challenge Minnesota Fats (the best pool player in the country) to earn a lot of money but overall to be the number 1. But is in NY where he is going to meet Sarah Packard, an alcoholic complicated woman, and Bert Gordon, who likes to bet in almost everything and owns Minnesota Fats between many other things. Sarah and Bert will teach Eddie in a few days much more about life of what he has learned in all his life in pools hustling. It's in this world of losers where Eddie Felson lives fast and loose always looking for some action.This movie deserves to be in the top 100 IMDb movies.",10,3,6,19 October 2008
Terminator Salvation," The worst film in the Terminator Series
","I had great expectations about this film being a Terminator 1 and 2 movies fan , thinking it would be much better than the mediocre 'Terminator 3' but I was wrong because T4 is not just bad but it is also very boring.I didn't like the plot that is more focused in the Marcus character than the one that we all care about which is John Connor, who in this opportunity is played by the wooden Christian Bale (I don't even like him in the Batman movies). I found the action scenes just OK, there was nothing new. The only thing I liked about T4 was the character of Blair Williams (I love her), which reminded me Sarah Connor, even though she has a limited screen time.It is 2018 and the humanity live in a post apocalyptic world. John Connor is one of the leaders of the Resistance who fights against the machines from the Skynet system, but in this opportunity he will be able to meet his still teenager father Kyle Reese and Marcus a mysterious man who may help him to destroy the Skynet system or maybe not .......4 starts = Boring",4,4,13,13 June 2009
Yes Man," Regular Entertaining Comedy
","This is just a regular comedy with some funny moments.Jim Carrey is OK here, Zooey Deschanel is very good as Allison and there is a good chemistry between the two of them. The plot is entertaining. This movie has a good message to enjoy more life. What I didn't like was the character of Norman, without him the movie would have been better. I think it should have lasted 90 minutes instead of 104. There are 3 very funny moments involving Carl: 1) at the 'Yes Man' meeting 2) In a discussion in a bar; and 3) A rare situation with one of his neighbors. Carl is a man who doesn't like to go out with his friends anymore since he got divorce spending his free time watching movies at home, but one day he follows a friend's advice of going to the 'Yes Man' meeting that will change his life leading him to meet the free spirited Allison and ......If you are going to see it I recommend watching it with your gf/bf or with your friends because in that way you will enjoy much more the movie.",6,1,2,3 February 2009
Cloverfield," A good popcorn movie
","I really liked it. I had my doubts before watching it but I was surprised of how entertaining this movie was.I liked the characters, the special effects, and the plot of the movie, specially the meaning that anyone can make anything for love. I also liked the final that is not Hollywood's style.This movie is similar to 'The Blair Witch Project' in that we see 'Cloverfield' through what has been recorded by some of its characters by a hand-held video camera along the movie (with some small scenes of what has been recorded before the movie has began).The plot is about a group of people in their twenties who are in a leaving party in NY when suddenly an enormous monster appears killing people in the city forcing everybody to evacuate, but this group of friends will stay to rescue a love interest of one of them.",7,0,1,17 December 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," This film has to be between the top 100 IMDb movie list
","This is one of my 3 all time favorites movies along with 'The good, the bad and the ugly' and 'Pulp Fiction'.For me this is the best movie that mix action with comedy. The chemistry between Paul Newman and Robert Redford is great. The way that Newman plays the quick Butch is very funny and is impossible not to like him, Redford is a good complement for him like the serious expert gunman Sundance.The plot of the movie is about two bank robbers Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid who are running away from the law in the old wild west, and they have a estrange love relationship with a beautiful young school teacher named Etta Place.The jokes are very clever and funny, like its famous quotes like 'who are those guys?' . The final scene of the movie is one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema.You have to watch this movie, it doesn't matter if you are young or old, male or female you will enjoy it the same, this movie is clever, has action, a little of romance and it's a lot of fun. You won't regret it.",10,0,2,29 November 2008
Blades of Glory," If u r going to watch it do it with your friends it will be funnier
","This is the kind of silly comedy to be watched just to relax, and if you see it with your friends it will be funnier. I have to say that I am glad I watched it because its stupid jokes and skating scenes are really funny. Will Ferrell is very funny here, and he really has a good chemistry with Jon Heder. The skating scenes are the funniest. What I didn't like were the bad guys they could have been better and funnier.Chazz and Jimmy are professional skaters who will have to be partners despite they don't get along so they can compete again after they were banned of competing individually, but they will have to beat the champions the Van Waldenberg (brother & sister) to get the glory again ........If you like the Adam Sandler movies then this movie is for you otherwise avoid it.",6,1,1,7 February 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Bourne Ultimatum is the weakest movie in the trilogy
","I didn't like 'The Bourne Ultimatum' so much,I think this movie deserves 6.5 stars, so I give it 1 star because this movie shouldn't be in the 250 top IMDb. I liked the first 2 movies of the trilogy: The Bourne Identity (2002)and The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and I think these movies deserve to be in the top 250 IMDb list.I didn't like the rare shots in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' because they are ugly and one can't watch very well what is going on specially in the parts of action. On the other hand I liked the scenes when Bourne is trying to be in contact with the journalist.In my opinion:The Bourne Identity (2002): 8.5 stars (very good +)The Bourne Supremacy (2004): 8.5 stars (very good +)The Bourne Ultimatum (2007): 6.5 stars (regular +)",1,1,4,21 October 2008
Burn After Reading," The characters are funny but the plot is unsatisfactory
","I went to the movie theater with a great expectation to watch this film and while I saw it I couldn't believe how it could have a 7.5 stars rate at IMDb. Having said that I have to say that the performances were good, I specially liked the work of Brad Pitt as a cheerful and stupid physical trainer. I also liked the character played by John Malkovich, he is very funny when he says 'fuck' when he is angry. The big problem with this movie is that the plot should have been more developed because it didn't get my complete attention even though I found the characters entertaining.The movie is about a woman who works in a gym who wants to have cosmetic surgery because she thinks it's necessary for her job but she doesn't have the money.One day certain disc is found at the gym with information about a life job of a ex CIA worker, so she with a friend of her work will try to blackmail this CIA worker in exchange for money.I recommend to wait to watch it when it's on TV, and just for the characters who are very funny.",6,6,12,23 December 2008
Watchmen," Interesting but It could have been much better.
","I had heard a lot about this movie that I really thought this would be much better, don't get me wrong this film is entertaining and interesting but not to be in the top 250 IMDb that is why I give it 1 star despite I think it deserves 6.5 stars.The special effects are great specially those scenes involving the Dr. Manhattan, the characters are interesting to watch but Dan Dreiberg which I found very boring. The plot is interesting, I liked most the parts involving the investigation made by Rorschach and the scenes where Dr. Manhattan appears. I found boring the parts in which Sally Jupiter / Silk Spectre & Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II are together. I think that this movie could have been much better.Because of the murder of one of the watchmen (The Comedian), Rorschach is going to make an investigation to find the murder who may be trying to kill all the watchmen; and at the same time there is a great probability of a war world 3 between USA and URSS ......If you like this kind of superheros movies give it a try otherwise don't.6.5 = regular +",1,7,19,9 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," Better than the first one
","I liked this movie better than the first one (which I rated with 6 stars = regular) because this is a much mature and intelligent film, on the other hand '28 days later (2002)' look like more the kind of film focused mainly for teenagers.I liked mostly the two adults leading characters, the beautiful medical officer Major Scarlet Ross and the cool sergeant Doyle. The teenagers actors are good too and actor Robert Carlyle is really good as their father Don. The plot is interesting and entertaining, the action and suspense scenes are great. What I liked most about it is that it doesn't end as one would think it could end once one has already met all the main characters.People are coming back to London for re-population after 28 weeks, once all the people infected of the Rage virus have starved to death in Britain. London is under control and protection of the US army, but one day the epidemic will appear again and the USA army will declare 'code red' ......I recommend this movie to everyone who likes terror or zombies movies .7 stars = good",7,2,4,22 February 2009
Disturbia," Not much of a Mystery
","I liked more this film as a teenager movie than as a mystery one.The actors are good in here specially Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer (she looks so cool and beautiful as Ashley) and David Morse, there is a good chemistry between Shia and Sarah; but it is how the film is developed that fails because 'Disturbia' looks more like a comedy romantic teen movie than any other thing.Kale is a teenager who has been punished not being allowed of getting out of his house otherwise he will go to a correctional, but his boring life at home will change when the beautiful Ashley move next door and at the same time he begins to suspect that one of his neighbor is a possible wanted serial killer ........6 stars = regular",6,0,3,5 April 2009
Die Hard 2," 'Die Hard 2' is my favorite of the four Die Hard movies
","I know that Die Hard 1 is consider the best of the Die Hard movies almost for everyone, but I have to say that I liked Die Hard 2 more. I find in this movie a better performance of Bruce Willis as the cool smart new york cop John McClane. The performance of Dennis Franz as the Capt. Carmine Lorenzo is very good too. I also find a better plot than the first one, and the action scenes are great. In this opportunity the action develops in an airport in Washingtong DC where John McClane is waiting to pick up his wife who is flying from Los Angeles to meet her family for Christmas at her parent's house, but serious problems are going to happened at the airport and John McClane will have to kick some asses so his wife's airplane may land safely. I think this movie doesn't deserve to be the one with less stars in the Die Hard series, this is a much better movie than Die Hard 3 & 4.",10,4,6,18 October 2008
No Country for Old Men," This is a good movie
","First of all I have to say that this is a good movie (it won the Oscar for best picture last year)but this film doesn't deserves to be in the top 250 IMDb list. I think this movie deserves 7.5 stars, and if you want 8 stars at the most.I liked most of the film except the parts when the character played by Tommy Lee Jones appears not because I don't like his work (which I like), the thing is that I found those parts very slow an boring.I think the problem is that many people who watch movies they like,they give 10 stars to these movies very easily without thinking that they are giving the same number of stars that only must got real masterpieces or great films in their genre like 'the godfather', 'die hard', 'The Exorcist', 'the seven samurai' between many others films.",1,3,8,6 December 2008
Revolutionary Road," Interesting movie, Better performances
","I thought this was going to be a more entertaining movie, but what make it worths to watch it are the performances of DiCaprio, Winslet and Shannon.I can't understand how Brad Pitt was nominated for the Oscar and not DiCaprio when he has a much better performance. The better moments of the movie are the conversations and discussions between the 2 leadings, the scenes where Shannon appears are very good too, the supporting characters are entertaining. I think the weak point of the movie is its length (119 minutes), I think 105 minutes would have been better because some moments the film is a little slow and boring.Frank and April are a young married couple who are tired of their boring life, that's why they decide to go to Paris and live there, but when Frank gets a better job and salary offer at his work, he will have doubts of leaving, that's when really serious problems begin in this couple's relationship .....This movie is recommended specially for adult people who like dramas.",7,0,1,2 February 2009
28 Days Later...," Discreet Movie
","I saw '28 days later' because it won a Saturn award for best SF movie and because its good score at IMDb, but this is just a discreet film.The firs half of the movie is strong and interesting but once the few survivors find help the movie decreases a lot and becomes more an action film than an Horror & Thriller one. The performances are good and one cares about the characters but the second half of '28DL' belonged to another film.Jim is a young man who wakes in a hospital and is surprised at seeing that there is nobody at the hospital and in the streets (like 'The Omega Man (1971)') because of a virus that makes infected people bite normal ones infecting them too, so he find some uninfected people and they will try to survive from the attacks from the infected ones...............This movie is highly recommended for male teenagers who likes actions scenes with a lot of blood, and not so much for adults who likes more developed plots.",6,0,1,26 January 2009
Gran Torino," Walt Kowalski is tough but a lot of fun too
","I think this is an entertaining and interesting movie, Clint Eastwood is very good as the tough Walt Kowalski, but this movie doesn't deserve to be in the top 250 IMDb.The plot is interesting, it has some funny moments too, and Clint is great when he is acting macho, this must be one of his best performances next to his roles in 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'The Unforgiven'. The actors who play his neighbors are good specially the one who plays Sue.Walt Kowalski is an old Korea war veteran widower who just lost his wife and doesn't get along with his Asian neighbors but when they will have problems with a gang he will help them .......7 stars = good",7,1,6,25 March 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Very long Boring movie.
","I thought this was going to be a very good film because of its interesting plot and its leading actors Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt but it turned out to be a too long and boring movie. I think it deserves 5.5 stars, but I give it a 1 because it doesn't deserves to be in the top 250 IMDb list.The plot is developed in a very slow pace and it lasts too long (166 minutes) that make it very boring. I have always liked Brad Pitt's work but I can't believe he has been nominated for the Oscar as best actor , the role he plays here could haven been played easily for any regular actor, I didn't find his role very difficult to be done. he has had better performances specially in 'Fight Club (1999)' where he deserved a Oscar nomination.Cate Blanchett is good here like in every role she plays. I Think this could have been better if it would have lasted only 120 minutes, taking away some parts when Benjamin is old. the final minutes are good and touch you, but despite these really good moments they don't delete the boring 85 % of this film.Benjamin Button was born old and each year he becomes younger, he gets younger in a place for old people and is there where he will meet Daisy the love of his life who is the granddaughter of one old woman who lives there , he will become sailor and will travel to many places before re meeting with Daisy.........This movie is recommended for people who likes very slow pace movies like 'Lost in Translation (2003)', or if you are a very romantic person and don't mind being bored during the first 146 minutes to enjoyed the last 20 touching minutes.",1,20,47,25 January 2009
Wimbledon," Entertaining Romantic Movie
","This movie was better of what I expected, it was interesting and entertaining.I had seen Paul Bettany in ' Gangster No. 1 (2000)' and I was surprised that he could do a romantic comedy so well too, he had a good chemistry with the beautiful Kirsten Dunst who is always good in this kind of movies. The plot is interesting and I liked a lot the tennis games scenes. What I didn't like so much were some silly moments involving Peter Colt's brother and manager. Peter Colt is playing his last tournament at Wimbledon and there he will meet Lizzie a young tennis player with a great future with whom he will begin a romance behind her father's back ..........I recommend watching it if you like romantic comedy movies.",7,6,7,7 February 2009
The Dark Knight," An overrated movie
","I think this movie deserves 7 stars, but I give it 1 star because I don't think this movie should be so high in the top 250 IMDb list.I liked the performance of Heath Ledger as The joker. That is why I think many people gave to 'The Dark Knight' 10 stars, and of course besides the great marketing that this movie had. I didn't like the voice that Christian Bale used when he was dressed like batman, he sounded so rare. I think Heath Ledger is going to be nominated for the Oscar awards for his performance as the joker in the supporting actor category.In short, this is a good movie, but an overrated movie.",1,14,35,15 October 2008
Total Recall," Total Recall
","I had read that 'Total Recall' was a great Sci-Fi movie but after I watched it I totally disagree. I think this movie deserves 5.5 stars, and not its average of 7.4 stars.I have to say that the first part of the movie is interesting and good, but after the character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger travels to Mars and meets Melina, 'Total Recall' becomes in a movie for children from 8 to 10 years old, this is the part which I found boring and naive.The characters are good, but it is the plot which declines since the middle of the film.If the movie would have continued like the first part Totall Recall would be a much better movie.",5,3,8,2 December 2008
Rocky," Rocky, the hero from our childhood
","'Rocky' must have been one of our favorite movies for most of us who were boys during the 70s and the 80s along with the 'Star Wars trilogy'.It's amazing watching Rocky fighting in the ring against Apollo, a much better boxer, with such a courage taking the beating of his life like a man.The plot is about Rocky Balboa a naive unknown boxer with a good heart who surprisingly works for a bookie as a betting collector to earn money, because of this he has problems with his old wise coach. Rocky spends his life boxing, collecting bets, hanging around with his annoying best friend Paulie and the shy Adrianna (Paulie's sister). Until one day unexpectedly Rocky will have the opportunity of his life to fight against the champion of the world Apollo Creed.Each time I watch this movie I cheer for Rocky during the fight against Apollo, as if Rocky were a good friend of mine whom I have known all my life.Hang on Rock.",10,1,1,18 October 2008
The Holiday," If U are a man don't watch it unless your GF begs U
","I thought 'the holiday' was going to be a better movie, I regret I watched it, I feel I lost 2 hours of my life. This movie deserves 5.5 stars and not its exaggerated 6.9 stars.I knew this was a chick movie but I have watched this kind of movies before like the ones starring Cameron Diaz and I liked them; besides I like the work of Jack Black, but he plays a totally different character in here of what we are accustomed. 'The Holiday' would have been much better if it had only focused in the relationship between the characters played by Cameron Diaz and Jude Law.I think this movie is too long, this was not make to be a great movie, just an entertaining romantic comedy SO WHY THIS MOVIE HAS TO LAST 138 MINUTES , 'the holiday' SHOULD HAVE LASTED 100 MINUTES AT THE MOST. I know this movie has a good message, good characters and some good moments , but like I said before IT LAST TOO LONG.",5,2,5,1 December 2008
There Will Be Blood," Slow movie but with an extraordinary performance of Daniel Day-Lewis
","I didn't like 'There Will Be Blood', I found it too slow and boring, but I have to admit that the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis was extraordinary (he won the Oscar for best leading actor) and Paul Dano was very good too, I think Paul deserved an Oscar nomination in the best supporting actor category.I think this movie deserves 6.5 stars, but I give it 1 star because I think is too high in the top 250 IMDb list, for me this movie shouldn't be in the top 250.I would recommend to watch this movie only for the extraordinary performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview, that must be one of the best performances in the history of cinema.",1,4,11,21 October 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Too high in the IMDb top 250 list
","This is a good movie but it doesn't deserve to be in the top 10 IMDb list. I think the reason why this movie has so high grade is because people like Jack Nicholson so much. This movie may deserve to be between the top 100, but no way in the top 10.The performances of Jack Nicholson as the free will spirit man and of Louise Fletcher as the cold nurse Mildred Ratched are pretty good, in fact they won the Oscars in the Best Actor and Actress Leading Role category.I think this movie deserves 8 stars and not 8.8, that's why I give it a 1.",1,13,83,19 October 2008
The Good Shepherd," Interesting but it's very long.
","I think this movie deserves 6.5 stars. The biggest problem of this movie is that it last too much(167 minutes), I think 120 minutes would have been much better. The performances are very good, specially Matt Damon who in this opportunity plays a CIA man which is totally opposite to the one of his Bourne's films. the movie is entertaining at the beginning but as long as this is running one doesn't care much about the movie because it's very long and it's told in a slow pace, but the last 20 something minutes are very entertaining again.This movie is about Edward Wilson, who is one of the founders of the CIA, where we can see his life since his last year at Yale university passing his relationships with 2 women and his son, his participation in WW2, his relations with Russian agents until his investigation to discover the leak about the Bay of Pigs Invasion............. If you liked the film JFK (1991)maybe you will probably like this movie too.",6,0,1,5 January 2009
Blade Runner," Too slow and boring
","I had heard a lot about this movie that it was one of the best SF movies ever, but after watching it I have to say that it is very boring in spite of its interesting plot and characters.The main problem with this film it is how it was developed with an extremely slow pace which wastes its interesting plot and entertaining characters. The performances are good specially Harrison Ford who looks like a detective from the film noir movies. How the movie looks is great; BUT ITS PACE IS TOO SLOW which made it VERY BORING, I had to struggle to not fall asleep.I know that this movie is very important because it makes us to think about the environment, the corporations, the evolutions in genetic science and in many other things, but to me the most important thing about a movie is that it has to be entertaining first and after that whatever you want, and I found this one very boring.",4,3,13,15 March 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Just Regular
","I expected a much better movie, I like most of the movies of Woody Allen, this one is entertaining but nothing more. I think this movie deserves 6.5 stars.The plot is interesting, the performances are just OK (except for Scarlett Johansson who is a very limited actress), the one who is very good is Rebecca Hall as Vicky, I have always liked the work of Penelope Cruz and I found her work good in here but not to have won an academy award. I found very stupid the scenes when the characters Juan Antonio and Maria Elena discuss in English when the are alone in a room and Cristina is in other part of the house.Vicky (a serious engaged woman) and Cristina (a free will spirit) are 2 young Americans friends who are in Barcelona on vacations and meet a painter named Juan Antonio (who has a little crazy ex wife called Maria Elena), the 2 women are going to have some kind of relationship with him that is going to change their way of looking life forever .........6.5 stars = Regular +",6,0,4,5 March 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Overrated movie
","I really don't understand why this film is so appreciated, OK it has a very strong love message and its beginning is very good but it decreases its quality each time the plot advances until the end. I think this film deserves 6.5 stars, but I give it 1 because it shouldn't be at the 250 top IMDb.The movie is divided in 3 parts: 1)when the leading characters are little children, 2) when they are young teenagers and 3) when they are old teenagers. The first part is great, the second part is entertaining but a little silly, and the third part looks like a bad movie, except by the last kissing scene which is very good and touching. If I had to rate the 3 parts it would be like this: part 1: 8 stars; part 2: 6 stars; part 3: 4.5 stars. Ah by the way I liked the final dance at the end.I didn't buy the circumstances under which the leading is questioned by the police by the suspicion he had cheated in the contest. I bought the parts where he knew the contest's answers (I liked the way they made it how he knew the answers) because we have always watched on the news about very rare good things that happen to people. As I said before the third part is very bad developed specially the scenes involving the under world of the Salim character.Jamal is a contestant of a TV program who is being questioning by the police by the suspicion he has been cheating. Jamal tells the police how the contest's answers are related with some facts of his life since he was a poor kid, and that he only wants to recover the love of his life by being part of this TV contest............I recommend watching this movie with your family especially because the children actors are very good.",1,46,111,20 February 2009
The Godfather," I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. Give 'The Godfather' 10 stars.
","I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). 'The godfather' is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in 'A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)') but I recognize that he made the role of 'vito corleone' one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.The best movie ever",10,7,12,6 November 2008
