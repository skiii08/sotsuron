Miracle," The greatest sports movie EVER!!!!
","At a glance this may seem like your typical David vs. Goliath sports story. While that is the theme, the movie is anything but typical. The true story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team, 'Miracle' is for anyone with a sense of national pride. Kurt Russell is legendary coach Herb Brooks, who defied all logic at the time to create the greatest hockey team in history. And I do mean team. Never ONCE does this movie fall upon the cliche of the final heroic moment by one player that secures victory. No, this movie is about team, about family. Early on Brooks asks his players 'Who are you? Who do you play for?' Each player answers with his name, and whatever team he had playing for up to that point. Brooks never lets on that this is not the answer he's looking for. Only later, after a humiliating defeat, does Brooks push his team to physical exhaustion in a quest for his answer. Finally, he gets it. 'Who do you play for?' 'I play for the United States Of America.' It's then the player realize that this is not about the individual. It's about one team, one nation. Now I'm probably being biased here, but Kurt Russell is outstanding as Herb Brooks. (Kurt Russell is my favorite actor) Brooks, cut from the 1960 Olympic hockey team one week before the games, was a no-nonsense coach. 'I'll be your coach, but I won't be your friend', he tells the team on the first day. His drive brought out the best in his players. Whether through exertion, intimidation, an unshakabe 'anything is possible' attitude, Brooks was a force to be reckoned with. The hockey scenes, strangely enough don't come off as revolutionary. In this day of digital technology you might expect sweeping camera movements or Matrix-like shots to put an additional 'Ohhh' factor into it. Instead, the scenes have a 'you are there' kind of feel to it. Why would this be? I think it's because what those men achieved in the Lake Placid games of 1980 was so incredible, that the filmmakers didn't need any fancy tricks to improve on it. Now I saw this film at a sneak preview that was undoubtedly filled with hockey fanatics. But I can't remember a time when I was with an audience that as so into a movie. During the game scenes, the applause was thunderous (and no, it was not applause from the theater sound system). At the end, after the victory, all I could hear was the sniffs of people crying. And when the credits rolled, accompanied by cast pictures saying where each member of the team is today, and Aerosmith's 'Dream On' playing, the applause was thunderous again. A great movie to see with a crowd. Hell, a great movie anyway.",10,0,0,1 February 2004
Dawn of the Dead," YES! Better than the original!
","Now let's get one thing clear right off the bat...I LOVE GEORGE ROMERO'S ORIGINAL MOVIE!!!! It is one of THE classics of horror. BUT....the remake surpasses it! Some have written that the movie makes no social statements. WHAT? Okay, the original made digs at consumerism by equating the zombies with mindless shoppers. However this one has a more profound subtext for a few of the characters. One of the survivors is pregnant. So the question is raised, as it is by many people in the real world, 'How can I bring a child into a world that's so screwed up?'.  The characters here also deal with an issue that the survivors in the original did not...what happened to their loved ones? In Romero's movie, NOT ONCE do the characters ever wonder about the fate of their friends and families. That issue is at the forefront of the new version. So to those that say there is no human drama here....what movie were you watching? But all that is incidental, what everyone wants to see this movie for is the zombies. Let me say to the purists out there....shuffling zombies ARE NOT SCARY!!!!! You can simply run, or in fact walk, right past them. Try that in the new movie. These flesh craving monsters will run your ass down, and be snacking on your vital organs before you can say 'undead'. Now THAT'S scary! The cast is excellent. Ving Rhames is the man, and owns every time he appears onscreen. Sarah Polley is a hottie, and maintains a cool head throughout. Jake Weber is very identifiable as the nice guy 'everyman'. You really care about these characters, and hope to see them survive. There is also great humor here. While on the roof of the shopping mall, our heroes communicate through large, handwritten signs with the owner of the gunshop across the street, who has retreated to his roof. There is a great scene where the on the roof of the mall, with binoculars, pick out zombies that resemble celebrities, and then have the gun shop owner blow them away. Also watch for the shop owner and Ving Rhames using their message boards back and forth to play chess. There are many nods to the original here, but they are very subtle. Watch for the heroes of Romero's version in cameo's. My favorite homage is right at the beginning of the movie. As Ana is driving down the road, we are treated to a high ariel shot looking down at her car on the highway. A helicopter flies in and out of frame. It is the same helicopted used by the characters in the original movie to escape the zombies that have overrun the city. So in the end, a great movie. Great tension. Great scares. Great humor. Great gore. A great treat for all horror fans.",10,0,0,20 March 2004
Shaun of the Dead," A triumph of the horror/comedy genre.
","Not since An American Werewolf In London has there been a movie so successful in this genre. Not only a great homage to the classic Living Dead movies, but a flat out hilarious movie to boot. This is not Resident Evil. Resident Evil is a video game. Even in film form, it's a video game, not a zombie movie. Not to say RE isn't entertaining in it's own right, but Shaun Of The Dead stands proud with the few movies that can make you scream and laugh in the same minute. This is destined to be a cult classic. One of the greatest scenes is Shaun walking through town on his daily routine not realizing he is surrounded by zombies. He just doesn't notice. It really does look at this situation from your everyman point of view. What if this did happen? Would you be ready with a plan? Would you have the stuff to survive? Where would you go? What would you eat? Where would you get BEER? For fans of the genre, this movie has it all. Scares, gore, laughs. What more could you ask for? Want a line up of great zombie comedies? It's a short list, but with a case of beer, a stack of pizzas, and your best buddies, it will be fun times for all. Here ya go, check out Shaun Of The Dead, Return Of The Living Dead, and the incredibly obscure but tremendously entertaining Night Of The Creeps.",Null,0,1,26 September 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," A VAST improvement over Reloaded.
","I have never been a HUGE fan of this series. I was not blown away by the original Matrix like most. Bullet time wasn't all that impressive, and I've never been a fan of Hong Kong style action movies. Plus it starred Keanu Reeves. How good could it actually be? But I still enjoyed it in an MTV-influenced kind of way. Now being the movie fan I am, I went to see Reloaded when it came out. When it was over I wanted my money back. Never in my life have I experienced such a overblown, self-important, mumbo jumbo spewing piece of dreck in my life. It does rate as one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. Sorry fanboy geeks, cool fx do not a movie make. In fact some of the fx were pretty bad. What's funny is the big chase scene they claimed was going to revolutionize movies, was topped twice this year. (T3 and Bad Boys 2. But then NO chase scenes will ever top final chase in The Road Warrior) But again, being a movie fan, I had to find out how it all ends. I went in with zero expectations, and ended up having a lot of fun. Well, after the first half hour anyway. The battle of Zion is one of the great action specatcles of the last 10 years. It is so 'in-your-face' that you feel like you're in the middle of it. It is worth the price of admission alone for the chance of seeing that on the big screen. The chase through the mechanical tunnels with the hovercraft and sentinels is dizzyingly exciting. The ships can twist any which way, and they took my stomach with them. Fun times. And while it utilized too much of it's trademark slo-mo, the final fight between Neo and Smith is the epic brawl the series needed. I mean these are two gods in this world. The fight couldn't be confined to groundlocked round kicks. They fly around, duking it out all over the city (ala Superman 2). Nice visuals with the lightning. Plus the story moved a lot faster versus Reloaded. Sur the first half hour or so dragged while they mopped up the afterbirth of Reloaded. But once it got moving, it was 'Get out of the way! Coming through! Lady with a baby!' fast. It may not wrap everything up at the end, but how could it? It's too lucrative of a franchise. If the current group involved in making this series decides to not make anymore, at least the studio still has a viable franchise to squeeze a few more dollars out of, and hire new blood to take over. So if you want your audio/visual senses overloaded, check out the movie. It's definately going to be demo material when it hits DVD.",Null,0,0,7 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Yes naysayers, it IS better than T2!!!
","They said it couldn't be done. No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Edward Furlong. Arnold well past his prime, both physically, and as a box-office powerhouse. All the early buzz indicated a disaster. But I knew, I felt it in my bones, that this film would be great. Why? Because too many people said it couldn't be done. It's always the way it works. When hype builds a movie up, and everyone is expecting too much (ala Matrix Reloaded), everyone is bound for a letdown. When all hope seems lost, and everyone's expectations are at their lowest, are we then surprised. So thank you all you T3 bashers, you have made me look like prophet! Terminator 3 is not only the best movie so far this summer, it stands head and shoulders above Terminator 2! It actually benefits from Cameron, Hamilton, and Furlong being absent. Camerson has become a Titanic-hugging hacked that peaked years ago. Terminator 1, Aliens, and The Abyss are all masterpieces. He's been on a downhill slide ever since. Sorry Motion Picture Academy, but Titanic sucked the big one. Someone tell me what Linda Hamilton has done besides the Terminator films that is worth watching......I'm waiting.....Thought so. She may have morphed from a whiny waitress, to a female Rambo, but there was nothing else for that character to do. Besides, for all her toughness in T2, she was a much more interesting character in the original. Finally, don't get me started on Edward Furlong. In T2, he was a whiny little bitch that I wished would get killed. He tried to come across as tough, but Furlong is such a bad actor, that he was laughable. T2 also relied too heavily on it's 'ooh' and 'aahh' fx. Yes they were spectacular and innovative, but it was too cool to be threatening. Now this is not to say that I didn't like T2. I did. Just not nearly as much as the first. Now comes T3 and the series has been given an incredible kick start. Kudos to the director, Jonathan Mostow. It is my opinion that Mr. Mostow is one of the hottest directors working today. His previous films, Breakdown and U-571, both breathed new life into their respective genres, and T3 is no exception. Mostow does not attempt to be Cameron, and the movie is all the better for it. Mostow brings his own style to the table, and the results are spectacular. The cinematography, editing, and pacing are all top notch. And the action sequences? Incredible! There is a vehicle chase at the beginning of this movie (I hesitate to say 'car chase' because cars don't really factor into it, unless they are getting demolished) that is awe inspiring. This is what the chase in Matrix Reloaded WANTED to be. It ranks as one of the best chase scenes in movie history. Right up there with The French Connection and The Road Warrior. There is also a brawl between the T-101 and T-X in a public restroom that goes all out. Great stuff. Now what would this movie be without characters? Nick Stahl is PERFECT as John Connor. Now a tortured soul, too torn up by the past to be hopeful of the future, Stahl let's it all hang out. He let's you feel everything Connor does. Hoping for the best, but all the while you feel that fate is going to catch up with you sooner or later. Claire Danes, who I have never been a big fan of, also shines. She is in full Linda Hamilton mode, but better. She is a caring person, but proves that she's tough as nails when the chips are down. Bravo, Ms. Danes. Arnold. What can I say about the man? He may have been away from the character for 10 years, but you'd never know it. Arnold is the Terminator. Now doubts about it. Welcome back Mr. Schwarzenegger, you've been gone too long. Now as for Arnold's nemesis, we have Kristanna Loken as the T-X. Quite simply she, with the exception of Mostow, had the most work cut out for her in this movie. Everyone know what to expect from Arnold. But it is a rule of action movies that they are only as good as their villian. Robert Patrick had the benefit of brand-new CG technology to back him up. While his performance was good, (Especially how he NEVER blinks his eyes while firing a gun. I'd like to see you try that. If you've never noticed, watch T2 and check it out) as I said before, the effects made him more cool than threatening. Now we have Ms. Loken. People scoffed at the idea of a female Terminator to begin with. SO the deck was really stacked against her. Well have no fear, the T-X is here, and she is as bad-ass as they come. Not only can she go toe-to-toe with Arnie, not only can she morph like the T-1000, but she has more than a few tricks up her sleeve. She can reprogram machines, manufature weapons from her arm, and remote control vehicles to really give you a run for your money. She is also one of the most INCREDIBLY beautiul women you will ever see. That adds to her manace, because she has the power of a woman's seductivness on her side, and believe me she uses it. Her beaufiul, icy stare is at once mesmerizing, and terrifying when you realize what is behind those eyes. Way to go Kristanna. Everyone gives their all. The director, actors, and the FX department. But unlike T2, they don't overuse the CG effects. They utilize many styles. GC, miniature work, makeup fx, mechanical effects, and good old-fashioned stunt work. As I said earlier, the chase scene is incredible. Even more so when you realize how much of it was done for real. Simply spectacular. What this movie also has, unlike T2, is the tension of the original film. In T2, you simply dont care about the people. They are only backdrop to the action and fx. Not so here. The makers realized that the characters needed to be as flushed out as the action. That brings the tension level up ten fold. Just like the original. So is it as good as the original? No. But then it couldn't be. So it doesn't try to be. BUT it is a damn great movie, and a big improvement over T2. The best praise I can give it is....BRING ON TERMINATOR 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9,5,8,3 July 2003
Alien vs. Predator," GREAT MIXING OF THE FRANCHISES
","As a fan of both series I can say that this was an excellent way to combine them. My biggest fear was that the PG-13 rating would hurt the movie, but it doesn't. Not in the least. I know a lot of people want to see the violent eruption of the Alien chestburster in all its' gory glory. Here, of course, it's done off camera. But director John Carpenter once said, 'Everyone knows what a man with a knife is going to do. You don't need to see it.' So since we've seen the alien burst, and seen the Predator slash, we're not missing anything if we don't see it here. Besides I'm sure it will be on the unrated director's cut DVD. My only complaint is that the movie is too short. Barely 90 minutes. I wanted more! But what I got I was happy with. Great visuals. The movie is thick with atmosphere. Great action. That's what you go to this movie for right? To see the Alien and Predator throw down? Well it's here and then some. Plus you get good tension very reminicent of the first two Alien films. While the dialog is, admittedly, very flat sometimes, the actors do fine. Sanaa Lathan is not Sigourney Weaver, but her character is firmly in control, and can kick Alien ass with the best of them. *SPOILER AHEAD* Her final confrontation with the Alien Queen is excellent. *END SPOILER* Lance Henrickson is a nice addition to link the series up, and his characters' nod to his ALIENS character is sly and hilarious. The rest of the characters are kind of stock, but the actors do well. Let's face it, we've seen enough of these movies to know who's going to get it and who's not. Let's not kid ourselves or berate the movie just because we're geek enough to know these things. Hell, when one character shows off a picture of his kids, I said to myself 'He's gonna get it first', and low and behold....So if you want a tense, fast paced, action packed movie featuring two of the greates monsters in cinema history, plunk down your money, grab your popcorn, and have a good time. And guys, it's a great date movie if your girl scares easy. :)",8,0,0,14 August 2004
Dodgeball," A great companion to BASEketball!!!
","Dodgeball is a great sports comedy. If you can call dodgeball a sport. When you make a movie about the big spectator sports like baseball and football, there's only so far you can go because you have to stay withing the widely recognized rules of the game. When you have something like dodgeball you can go hog wild, because the event itself is already so over the top. Vince Vaughn is great as the too-nice-for-his-own-good owner of a small time gym that is, unfortunately, located directly across the street from Ben Stiller's Globe Gym wannabe. In an effort to save his business, he signs himself, and some of his regulars up in a dodgeball tournament to win enough money to get out of debt. Well Stiller's character will have none of that, and signs up his own team to stop them. There you go. That's the plot. It's as deep as a mouse's grave. The movie lives on the charm of it's two leads. Fortunately, Vaughn and Stiller are more than up to the challenge. Vaughn plays it relatively straight, but sneaking in the snide one liners with a smoothness that would make the like of Bill Murray and Chevy Chase proud. Stiller gives a severely over the top performance that perfectly fits the over the top character. If I had to say something negative about his performance, it's only that it's basically the same performance he gave as the demented, fitness crazed leader of a fat kids camp in the Dusney movie 'Heavyweights'. But he was so good there, I liked seeing a revisit of that character. Rip Torn is great as the old time dodgeball player whose coaching style will have you doubled over laughing. Chritine Taylor doesn't have much to do but look hot. But she's DAMN good at it. You are one lucky man Ben Stiller. Then there are the dodgeball games themselves. There are more than enough vicious hits, beanings, and low blows to have the audiences rolling in pain and laughter. Is it low brow humor? Of course. So when it comes on DVD, get your buddies together, get the chips, tap the keg, and set down with a double feature of this and BASEketball, and have a great old time.",Null,0,0,27 June 2004
