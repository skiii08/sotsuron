Walk the Line," a perfect Luke-warm
","Well, perhaps this has been said before, but here goes anyway. I thought it bore a striking resemblance to the movie 'Ray,' which I thought was better. The brother that dies in childhood, the addiction, the cheating (although he went the other direction on that one). The music was okay, but not that great. Bravo to them for learning it and managing to sound decent. Reese Witherspoon did do a pretty good job, however Joaquin Phoenix was the one singing the most recognizable ditties, and his voice fell disappointingly short of the throaty low bass of johnny cash. I thought they would have given him a lot more charisma. But one must also take into account that my vote comes quite a bit from watching a sweaty Joaquin Phoenix creep me out to the point of distaste. The pallor he can assume is startling, whatever movie it might take place in, and the shaking is perfect for any sort of addiction, depression, or mania. It wasn't completely horrible, but there really weren't any beautiful points, whether they be in cinematography, acting, or dialogue - nothing funny, nothing lovable, nothing heart-wrenching; just mildly entertaining. since i have a firm respect and liking for johnny cash and his music, i can say that being a fan of the real person doesn't mean one has to buy the movie. the only really good part of the film was the shadow of the late and great.",5,0,5,3 April 2006
