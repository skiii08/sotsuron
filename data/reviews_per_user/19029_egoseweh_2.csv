Miracle," Embodies the spirit of American sports.
","Miracle is not a good movie because it tells a story of 'The Miracle on Ice', Miracle is a good movie because it brings forward all the problems this country was having at that time.  This movie made it clear that this Miracle wasn't just one for American hockey fans, it was one for Americans all-together because it gave them hope of better things to come.  As have most sports films created by Disney, this movie doesn't just focus on the sport or on an event, it brings real issues to the front and relates them with the way sports can bring people together.  Russell did an excellent job displaying the demeanor and dedication of Brooks.  This movie is very inspiring and a must see.  It had me wanting to jump out of my seat when the U.S. won, even though I already knew what was going to happen.",8,0,0,8 February 2004
Hellboy," As was expected
","I didn't go into the theater with great, or even good expectations for this movie.  Frankly I think the movie industry is going a little overboard with the whole comic book realization thing.  Pearlman did well as Hellboy, as good as it could have been done I suppose.  The desire for a romantic connection for Hellboy to make him seem human was clear, but the script just didn't deliver in this area at all.  Of course the action scenes were great, but that's true of any movie nowadays.  I thought the ending was absolutely ridiculous.  Simply sticking a pack of TNT down the big monster's throat doesn't satisfy my need for a thrilling ending to what should have been an impressive battle between good and evil.  The characters were well thought-up, but chalk that up to the comic book creators.  I wasn't at all impressed with this movie, and I left myself plenty of room to be impressed with as low of expectations as I had for this movie.  Don't see it in theaters, and I would only see it on DVD/Video if one of my friends happened to rent it and bring it over.",3,0,2,4 April 2004
