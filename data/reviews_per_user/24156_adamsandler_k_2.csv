50 First Dates," One of his best...
","Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! I saw this film 5 times at the cinema and I am now the proud owner of the DVD!! I am an ADAM SANDLER freak...and I thought that this movie was fantastic, after waiting what seemed like forever for him to complete another movie.This movie is funny and sad (I cried) and very entertaining. Suitable for all ages (except some of the language if you mind that kind of thing) and my parents are right into it.Henry is a very likable character. Drew and Adam take up where they left off with the Wedding Singer - their chemistry is great! Lucy's father and her brother Doug (played by Sean Astin) are hilarious and provide many laughs throughout.Although the storyline may sound a little unbelievable from the outset, the funny and romantic parts make up for it.GO SEE IT!

Million Dollar Baby," Glad I Changed My Mind!
","I wasn't going to see this film - I thought I could wait until its DVD release. THEN, my aunt came over and raved about it. I was so curious that I went out the very next day and saw it.Million Dollar Baby is an amazing story and I really liked it. I just think Hilary Swank can pick a winner of a script when she sees one! She may not be Hollywood's top actress, or even in a lot of films - but the ones she does appear in are awesome! I am only 21 years old, and usually right into comedies and the like, but this is a movie that I will definitely see again. I cried. I rated this film 9/10 - but it may be even better than that. Don't think twice about going to see it! I almost did!!",9,3,5,27 February 2005
