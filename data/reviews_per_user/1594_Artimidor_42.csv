The Double Life of Véronique," Reflections from the looking glass
","Here's a kind of movie that helps you think outside the proverbial box: Meet Véronique, the French protagonist who chances upon a most unusual face - en passant, in a fleeting moment, like a reminder from another life. The face of the person she sees is her own. Somewhere on a Polish plaza, to briefly surface and drown again in the crowd. 'La Double vie de Véronique' teaches you to appreciate escaping the comfort zone of trusted logic, recognize its pitfalls and see a strange, maybe even absurd fantastic premise in an otherwise realistic picture as a chance to discover something that cannot be named. Sure, Kieslowski pictures are always a combination of beautiful images, evocative music and a strong cerebral component, but 'La double vie de Véronique' is his most enigmatic, thought provoking work. Various threads are spun by writer and director which appeal to the viewer's imagination, so that they may be connected or respected just the way they are. Or perhaps seen as a whole in the eye of the beholder in front of the screen: Two different lives, one face, strings attached or mere coincidence? Is there fate? Does the demiurge work as puppeteer or are our actions influencing others in a way we would never anticipate? There are no metaphors in my work, Kiesloswki once said. Sounds challenging? Feel free to connect your own dots in this magical adventure of parallelism seen through the looking glass!Just one thing: The purpose of art is not to provide answers and be prescriptive in its implications, be they moral, social, historic or otherwise, but rather to open up new pathways and perspectives and question what we've been used to take for granted. In this respect Kieslowski succeeds indubitably and delivers a dazzling work of art to be looked at. Again and again.",9,1,2,9 June 2012
Vertigo," A killer combination - Stewart, Novak, Herrmann, Hitchcock and the perfect script
","'Vertigo' is one of those killer combinations where just about everything fits like a glove. For one there's the ingenious screenplay by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor based on the French novel 'D'Entre les Morts'(usually translated as 'From the Realm of the Dead'). It's a spellbinding narration of a retired San Francisco police detective who gets caught up in mysterious events with supernatural undertones, peppered by deception, betrayal, crime and obsession. Then there's the cast: John 'Scottie' Ferguson is played in understated fashion by James Stewart, the epitome of the humble, humane gentleman and good friend who cannot deny a favor. Confronting him with mystifying blond sexbomb Kim Novak really gets things rolling and is electrifying to see. Every moment of the main characters' difficult relationship throughout the film is absolutely believable and their chemistry on screen evident and riveting. In the music department Bernard Herrmann once again outdoes himself with an engrossing score, which will make you hold your breath in anticipation of what lies ahead - or hit you right in the face whenever necessary, and that's a good thing. The cinematography? Pitch perfect. Locations like the Golden Gate Bridge shine in all their Technicolor glory as do striking camera shots like the one from the roof at the very beginning or those from the Old Mission San Juan Bautista bell tower.All the brilliance is carefully constructed and well held together by master director Alfred Hitchcock himself, who knows how to pull one into the film, how to get into the characters, how to make one dizzy (with style!) - and how to zoom in while at the same time physically pulling the camera back, the astonishing trademark shot of 'Vertigo'. A film to be watched again and again, practically flawless and all the way masterfully executed.",10,5,8,13 May 2012
Come and See," Come and see... the horsemen of the apocalypse
","The horror first rears its ugly head only in the corner of an eye in Elem Klimov's shocking WW II masterpiece. Almost as if it isn't real, just an illusion, a dark thought, maybe an omen, but nothing more - how could years and years of family and village life be torn away in the maelstrom of one disturbing instance? This particular shot lasts only a moment, just one character observes the irrevocable truth and there are no words to describe it. By not talking about it maybe it will all be muted, made untrue forever - for that one person and for everyone. But the brutal war reality that strikes a young Belorussian boy and his girlfriend doesn't stop at that, it is merely beginning...'Come and see', a passage from the 'Book of Revelations', is indeed an apt title for a film that makes it clear that the end of the world as we know it has come upon us: Welcome to the theater of war, to the shocking and unremitting images of the horsemen of the apocalypse sweeping over Belarus as if there is no tomorrow. 'If we show the brutal truth, people won't see the film,' Klimov warned his writer Ales Adamovich, but got countered with: 'This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace.' Klimov himself didn't make another film after this one. He said it all here. Right. As this is not a film about soldiers fighting bravely and earning their medals, a tragic story with an optional melancholic undertone to it that makes you sigh and move on. This picture is about the innocent victims, the shameless atrocities committed to them, the dilemma of the few survivors who are forced to fight for their mere existence. This is the unvarnished documentation of a nightmare, shot in earthy tones between beautiful idyll and the grisly aesthetics of war. It is merciless, haunting, traumatizing, not to be forgotten. With non-professionals in the lead Klimov uses close-ups upon close-ups to get in their eyes, the mirrors of their souls, where unparalleled devastation lingers. Come and see the raw cataclysm of a doomed generation living not too long ago, back then when the unspeakable happened, still present in the corner of your eye. Be prepared.",10,9,10,20 April 2013
Citizen Kane," 'Rosebud' leaves its indelible traces
","When RKO Radio Pictures gave young radio celebrity Orson Welles the opportunity to work on two pictures of his own little did they know that these two projects nearly would cause the company to go bankrupt. 'Citizen Kane' was one of those films where the then 25 year old director and star Orson Welles pulled every possible trick from the books to make an impression, yet - while immediately critically acclaimed - nobody wanted to see the result. By now however the movie's profound influence in American film making is undisputed. And there's a lot one should know about it.For one as far as the technical side is concerned: Welles shot in deep focus (front and back are both in focus at the same time), used subtle optical illusions, framed his scenes brilliantly, pioneered with invisible wipes, worked with models combined with sets and matte drawings, cleverly placed cameras to force strange angles, even moved furniture there and back again while in a scene, played with mirrors, shots that emphasized size and grandeur or dwarfed a person - the list goes on and on. 'Citizen Kane' however is also all about acting, as there's no moment when the viewer doesn't buy Kane's age whenever he is seen - be it in is early twenties or on his deathbed decades later. The character's body language and mannerisms are believable throughout, and when we get to the final reel and finally learn the secret we feel that we really have the key to understand that person. Ah yes, speaking about 'rosebud'... That's the third point that needs mentioning: The depth of the story. It's core was inspired by tycoon Randolph Hearst, whose media outlets promptly boycotted the film in reaction, Hearst even wanted to buy the film in order to destroy it... Ah, Welles apparently was on to something! But there's of course a lot of fiction as well in 'Citizen Kane' thanks to screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, and so 'rosebud' leaves its indelible traces in everyone who ever tried to get to the bottom of the mystery.",9,1,2,6 March 2012
12 Angry Men," Fonda casts a contagious shadow of a doubt
","One room, twelve men and talk, talk, talk. Ninety minutes of film. Sounds like a bore, but turns out to be quite the opposite. The back room of a courthouse where a jury of ordinary men has to decide upon life and death becomes the place of first rate drama, where a seemingly insignificant shadow of a doubt makes people talk at least once more about what at first appeared to be a clear cut case. Henry Fonda with his understated play is in the lead of the doubters, supported by strong character actors like Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden or Martin Balsam.The reluctant, some even clearly prejudiced members of the motley jury all look at the case from very different angles, but they are made real by distinguished acting and screenwriter Reginald Rose's crispy dialog, which never misses the mark. Also remarkable is the fact that the battle of the jurors is embedded in a highly believable environment - a hot day, people sweating, emotions getting the better of them, then a downpour outside, there are casual conversations about what's on people's minds in the breaks, restroom scenes which serve further character elaboration. Director Sidney Lumet on his part focuses on making the film as claustrophobic as he possibly can. He uses subtle camera tricks to gradually make the confined space even seem closer to the actors as the film progresses to add to the mounting intensity and the final shots are made from below eye level to reflect the change that has taken place. '12 Angry Men' above all is a captivating character study. It is not about solving a crime, but characters confronted with decision making and how they approach it. Exceptional film-making.Side note: '12 Angry Men' was remade in 1997 with another outstanding ensemble cast headed by Jack Lemmon. A decent film, but no reason to miss the original.",10,0,0,25 May 2012
The Hustler," Character vs. talent - a showdown
","Among the best character studies you can see on screen undoubtedly has to rank Robert Rossen's 'The Hustler'. The pool played in the film is fascinating, however secondary, as actually it's all about three characters you get to know up close: the title figure Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) who has his own self-imposed agenda, which is no less than reaching for the stars, then we have the alcoholic off kilter Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) the anti-hero spends his days and nights with and the sleazy cutthroat manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), who's determined to squeeze every dime out of Eddie whatever it takes. And last but not least there's the big fish Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) who has to be brought to his knees - but that's just one side of the story. All of these main characters have exemplary screen presence, weight and intensity, so that the stakes are felt and leave their emotional traces in the viewer. Paul Newman at the time was just hungry to proof himself, and he did, Scott in one of his first films already steals a couple of scenes and would continue to do so constantly in 'Patton' and 'Dr. Strangelove', and Laurie is anything else but the sweet love interest. And Jackie Gleason? Can a comedian in such a dramatic role work? You bet!Shot in black and white the language of the film is social realism which indeed comes across very strongly. Even the central pool hall is not just a set, but the real thing, the bit parts are played by genuine characters themselves, among them the real ex-fighter and later bartender Jake LaMotta (see Robert DeNiro's characterization in 'Raging Bull'). All these details help to get us into the milieu, the thrill of the game, and we become part of the onlookers - it's almost as if one can smell the smoke-filled room and is tempted to make a bet. And there, in this arena it takes place: the fight between the clashing egos, where we also finally learn about the decisive difference between character and mere talent: Who will win and who will lose? And what is the price?",9,0,0,1 October 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'Dmitri, we have a little problem...'
","If you intend on learning to love the bomb, meet the Generals Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) and 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. 'Patton' Scott), then add Peter Sellers multiplied by three - and of course Stanley Kubrick. The year is 1964, and the war out there is pretty cold: Welcome to the end of the world! Let's jump right in and go for condition red, that's a jolly good idea for a start, don't you think? Make yourself at home in the war room, where a poster makes it perfectly clear that 'peace is our profession'! Here, take some gum! You might have guessed it already: If you want your humor black and apocalyptic, you've found the right movie. The doomsday machine is waiting for its cue, as some madmen got something up their sleeve. Well, admittedly, there's a wee bit of inconvenience with that whole affair, because somehow the legendary red button actually already got pushed, and it's only a matter of time until... But don't you worry - the two presidents are talking it out! However, should the world - against all odds - still stand after everything is said and done someone might get in trouble with the Coca-Cola company. Alternatively, look in your survival kit to find three lipsticks and some pairs of nylon stockings. That should help! Apparently there's no genre Kubrick couldn't do. Be it sci-fi, horror, war movie, epic, historical drama or political satire with this one - Kubrick's perfectionism leaves no doubt that he's master of his domain. And in the case of 'Dr. Strangelove' he was also on the pulse of his time, or quite ahead of it if you will. As even decades later it's still OK to get goosebumps when Vera Miles' gets to finally sing 'We'll meet again'...",9,1,2,5 March 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," A visual feast for the eye and food for thought
","Weaving a fairy tale into a harsh war environment, combining historical drama, fantasy elements and horror and make everything work when it is played against each other is not an easy task. 'Pan's Labyrinth' works. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro tells a little girl's story in fascist Spain of 1944, and it is full with mythology, symbols, lush colors, jaw dropping scenery, dreamlike music and lots of imagination. Coming from his heart, conceived years before he finally could commit it to celluloid, del Toro knows what strings to pull in the film which he also authored. As a director he prefers real sets, miniature shots and actors over CGI, and while the latter has its part as well, it is more a supportive role in order to tell the tale. Said tale is far more than the traditional good versus evil, it's about contrasts and the collision of worlds for sure, but also about choices within and outside realities if you will, about convictions and truths only found in one's self.In a way 'Pan's Labyrinth' has a lot to do with Terry Gilliam's absurd fantasy retro-sci-fi film 'Brazil' or even 'Tideland', though it differs distinctly in style from these examples. And like Gilliam's pictures 'Pan's Labyrinth' is like a breath of fresh air for those who want to get out more of fantasy than the common orc bashing. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a fairy tale and tragic reality at the same time, a visual feast for the eye and food for thought, filmed poetry to be enjoyed and appreciated more with every viewing. If you like intelligent fantasy, this is your thing.",9,2,4,8 March 2012
Alien," First rate horror, oozing dread and despair
","Ridley Scott's 'Alien' has easily advanced to the definitive modern day horror classic by hiding the horror rather than showing it, thus appealing primarily to the viewer's imagination and omitting in-the-face special effects. The man in a costume, cheesy must-have in all kinds of sci-fi and horror flicks of the fifties and sixties, still serves his purpose in this film, which however has the advantage of being masterfully directed. 'Alien' is a perfectly slow paced composition of shadows, noises, musical cues, a film of claustrophobic, tense atmosphere oozing dread and despair, all this creating suspense in the most accomplished Hitchcockian sense: The film provides a scenario where the unknown danger is as unpredictable as it is certain that it does strike.Aside from its directorial brilliance, 'Alien' of course also has one of the most innovative monster designs in movie history to offer (H.R. Giger's incredibly beautiful otherworldly creature), another excellent Jerry Goldsmith score, exceptionally strong characters and an outstanding female lead in Sigourney Weaver - and last but not least there's that perfect script, which makes a relatively simple idea into an unforgettable story. Put in three words: First rate horror.",9,2,4,3 January 2012
Taxi Driver," Existentialistic abyss in downtown New York
","'Taxi Driver' is the classic picture that put the combination Scorsese plus DeNiro and as an extra Jodie Foster seriously on the map - all in one go. Supported by Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and accompanied by one of the last of Bernhard Hermann's brilliant scores the movie struck a nerve in the audience of the Seventies and paved the way for more explicit violence to come to the silver screen in the following decades. Which is not a good thing in itself, but an inevitability with 'Taxi Driver' at the forefront. However, the outstanding performance of DeNiro and the painstaking perfectionism of Scorcese's direction make a psychotic taxi driver's prowling through New York's underground on the edge of reality absolutely worthwhile.According to screenwriter Paul Schrader his script was influenced by French existentialism, particularly its primary representatives Sartre and Camus. Indeed, the plot of Camus' novel 'L'Etranger' ('The Outsider') parallels the movie in key points - loneliness, isolation and estrangement of the protagonist are enforced by the absurdity of the world around the protagonist and lead to a deadly outcome. The alienation Camus defined as an existential category, Schrader transfers to the urban jungle of NY. While hinting at a Vietnam trauma taxi driver Travis Bickle might be suffering from, this background is never actually explored, thus providing ample opportunity for the viewer to connect with the character. As such 'Taxi Driver' is more than a movie about a madman. It is a thought-provoking and dangerous look into the abyss that lurks beneath skyscrapers and into our souls, a place where only we ourselves can answer.",9,0,0,30 April 2012
Full Metal Jacket," The Marine Corps wants killers!
","The drill instructor incessantly shouting at his 'ladies': commands, obscenities, insults... Again and again and again... A bathroom scene with that special bullet lending the film its name in the lead role... A crazed gunner in a chopper randomly machine-gunning civilians... An open mass grave, reporters swarming about... A photo-op with a dead... A female sniper on the floor pledging to be shot... - All these are scenes that stick with you from Kubrick's venture into Vietnam entitled 'Full Metal Jacket', another high quality Kubrick war entry.'Full Metal Jacket' is not a perfect film, though. The second half, which takes place in Vietnam, is overshadowed by the immensely powerful boot-camp hell of the first hour where Vincent D'Onofrio (as Gomer Pyle) and R. Lee Ermey (the drill instructor) give the performances of their lives. However, this part alone stands head and shoulders above comparable movies of the genre. While the rest is not as spectacularly staged and grabbing as elsewhere, the mentioned moments leave their mark, also thanks to Kubrick's fast pacing and his effective juxtaposing of war-time brutality and carefree music from the Sixties and Seventies. The contrast of Nancy Sinatra's 'These Boots are made for Walking'' against a shocking full stop in the middle of the film alone makes this movie worth the price of admission.",9,0,2,5 April 2012
The Grapes of Wrath," Just a taste of Steinbeck - flawed, but great enough
","John Steinbeck's 'The Grapes of Wrath' undoubtedly ranks among the greatest works of American realist literature. It stands as a testament of the Great Depression era where tenant farmers of the dust bowls suffer under drought, then are brutally dispossessed and driven from their Oklahoma homes, forced to find their luck elsewhere. In the end all they have is themselves, as the trip to find the blessed land California demands a heavy toll, is accompanied by tragedies and setbacks and the outlook is bleak in the face of the greed that exploits honest workers to make a buck. John Ford tries the impossible - to go for an authentic rendition of the multilayered, detail packed, all around magnificently written Steinbeck material, and definitely succeeds in delivering an indispensable heart-wrenching film portraying the never ending struggle of the Joads. Any direct comparison between book and film however is moot, enjoy both for what they are. On board in this road movie of the existential kind are Henry Fonda as an ex-convict, John Carradine as a disillusioned preacher and the Oscar winning Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, all first-rate acting with strong support of an array of bit players who help the crude reality take shape. Highly recommendable! There are downsides, though. For one the two hours of screen time can barely correspond to the epic proportions of the novel. However, the entry is still much more complete than Kazan's adaption of Steinbeck's other epic drama 'East of Eden', starring Jimmy Dean, which only shows a fraction of the story. The one real liability however is the diluted ending which was tucked on as a concession to the mass audience while Steinbeck's epic hits you with full force. Well, if you want the real thing, read the book. With the film you get a pretty good taste of it.",9,4,5,21 August 2012
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Timeless mysticism founded in stark realism
","The saint Maid of Orléans' legend has been filmed many times, but no version can hold a candle to Dreyer's groundbreaking silent take on the subject matter. What the ingenious Dane himself dubbed 'psychological realism' and 'realized mysticism' is a masterfully shot close-up feast generating an overwhelming flood of imagery, a lead that Dreyer called the 'martyr's reincarnation herself' (the incomparable Renee Falconetti) and powerful re-enactment of original dialog transcribed at the trial in 1431. But it's also a forthright picture sans make-up, sound, not even a backstory is there, but all of it is lacking for a reason. 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' is completely focused film-making, minimalism in its purest form, centering entirely on a core theme and thus radically eliminating all other elements that hinder the primary endeavor. Even the sets only seem to exist merely on the fringe of the spiritual drama and tragedy, which unfolds through the eyes of the actors via glimmers, flickers and stares. Confronted with piercing questions again and again circling like vultures above the torn state of mind of the famous maid, Joan's soul is revealed to us. Enlightened or a lunatic is not for the film-maker to decide. However, simplicity elevated to a film-making method makes our own observations a devastating and spellbinding journey at the same time, a journey into another world from where there is no escape. What we witness is indeed timeless mysticism founded in stark realism, and that's why it shakes us to the bone.Dreyer preferred the picture to be shown in dead silence, which makes 'Joan of Arc' work as a highly contemplative, almost tangible spiritual experience of the first rank. Nevertheless several composers have tried to provide a score to this masterpiece, giving the scenes a completely new spin - all very diverse attempts, ranging from piano accompaniment to very modern interpretations. The definitive one of these is Richard Einhorn's orchestral choir supported 'Voices of Light' soundtrack (1995), a masterpiece in itself, but together with Dreyer's intimate rendering of Joan of Arc's devotion to her belief an entirely new sublime work of art emerges. Completely silent or with the Einhorn score: there's no way around Falconetti's soulful portrayal in one of the greatest films of all time.",10,1,3,25 March 2013
The Shining," Every genre has its Kubrick
","Apparently there's no genre Kubrick cannot ace. Be it sci-fi, historical drama, political satire, war movie, film noir, erotic mystery thriller, or - as in this case - horror. 'The Shining' undoubtedly has a very firm Kubrick stamp on it and made Stephen King's material entirely his own, a fact that King didn't particularly like and thus had it remade for TV years later. While the TV version has some merits and follows the book more closely, the way it is it will always be compared to a master film maker's take on the material King provided and therefore doesn't stand a chance. As what Kubrick's 'The Shining' offers is Stephen King plus the necessary extra to make it legendary horror cinema.'The Shining' shines most of all because of Jack Nicholson's tour de force performance. He plays the protagonist Jack Torrance chillingly real, making his inevitable descent into madness in the deserted haunted winter resort a frightening experience to observe. The traditional horror clichés are all there of course: stimulation of imagination, the ghostly apparitions lurking in the corners, the air of eeriness and anticipation that permeates the place, the constantly widening shadow of a deadly menace. What makes it different is the director who knows his craft, uses effective POVs in intimate scary moments, long shots to add to the felt isolation and dehumanization, convex lenses to enhance surreal qualities, so that the master's handwriting shows in every action. Undoubtedly creating a unique horror picture is difficult. But well, fortunately every genre has it's Kubrick!",10,1,3,26 June 2012
Apocalypse Now," Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen between animal and god
","With 'Apocalypse Now' Francis Ford Coppola transfers Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' tale into the 20th century and makes it part of the horrors of the Vietnam war. The result is a beautifully shot, highly suspenseful and entertaining movie, which can be labeled THE war movie with all bells and whistles in a scope rarely seen before in similar productions. Staggering cinematography, an excellent script, a crisp and vivid tapestry of sound and musical ambiance, the perfect use of location and of course the cast - with bit players like Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne or Harrison Ford -, all contribute to a cinematic event of the grand scale.Most remarkable of course are the performances of the two main characters - for one protagonist Martin Sheen (who plays Captain Willard) and the one he's searching for deep in the Cambodian jungles, the decorated US commander gone mad, Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). The build-up to the encounter alone already keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat, and the pay-off is condensed in the intense and unnerving final minutes of the film. While we get there more and more questions are raised about the nature of the war that is being fought, as madness isn't only waiting on that other end of the journey, but becomes a principle in itself on the way - thus questioning the mission, the causes and the means: Man's position between animal and god is uncertain, but as self-assigned master over life and death his decline into madness only seems like a natural reaction...",10,0,1,18 March 2012
The Battle of Algiers," The price of freedom
","'The Battle of Algiers' undoubtedly ranks among the most unique, innovative and essential war films to date. Especially because it comes entirely without the pathos, glorification, special effects and artificially created drama that crowds want to see to get some entertainment out of war. Instead the viewer gets a fresh historical scenario - the 1956/57 Algerian insurrection of the National Liberation Front (FLN) against the French colonists. Following the events laid out in the 'Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger', a book written in prison by of one of the former FLN leaders, Yacef Saadi, it is an unvarnished account of a brutal reality that emerged as a natural consequence of colonial oppression. To add to the realism Yacef Saadi - now an Algerian senator - even plays a key part in the production.Outstanding feature of the film is that director Gillo Pontecorvo opts for a breathtakingly dramatized documentary style, a genre where he came from and clearly feels at home. The result is very close to newsreel footage, which makes it look like no other comparable war picture: Executions, demonstrations, strikes, bombings, interrogations, the house-to-house guerilla warfare look so real that Pontecorvo had to point out explicitly that not a single frame of actual documentary or news footage was used in the film. Furthermore the film stays as unbiased as possible and portrays both sides of the conflict: the rebels with the few, risky and desperate means they are capable of organizing to hurt the enemy, and the French paratroopers under Col. Mathieu striking back with unrelenting force in order to crush the FLN's backbone. The picture hasn't lost any of its relevance since the day it was made, as an uncomfortable question on both sides of a conflict arises again and again: Do the ends justify the means?",10,2,5,26 December 2012
Gone with the Wind," The wind might be gone, but it still steals the thunder
","They don't make pictures like this anymore. There, I've said it. And it's not necessarily a bad thing. The artistic techniques to put a four hour seminal epic like 'Gone with the Wind' on screen were quite different and limited back in the days, however the inventiveness to tell a great story and choose the right means was disproportionately higher - and it shows.The brainchild of powerful producer David O. Selznick, the filmed version of Margaret Mitchell's best seller does nothing that hasn't been done before, but everything with utmost perfection and teems with high production values every way you look at it. The list of what 'Gone with the Wind' lifts high above other films just goes on and on: There's of course that great story of the Old South dealing with a generation entangled in the throes of the American Civil War. This however is only the backdrop of one of the greatest romances of all time, which is not presented as sugar-coated, tear-jerking escapism, but as a wild clash of sexes through strong personalities, driven by egotism and vanity, mirroring the downfall of a whole civilization. The narration is shown in lush Technicolor cinematography, at key points composite storybook images are used with layers upon layers of painted images added to the shots in order to exude the required sense of drama and give it a fairy-tale, almost dreamlike quality. Hundreds of costumed extras fight and litter the street of dying men the heroine Scarlett walks through to give just one shining example, Max Steiner's score is grand and epic, and the cast headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is legendary as their sensual tension is deep and intensely felt by the viewer. In short: 'Gone with the Wind' is a marvel of cinematic brilliance, and more. And to everyone who thinks otherwise: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.",10,2,3,17 June 2012
City of God," I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.
","Films about violence there are aplenty. Many of them are purely fictional and are glamorized bloodbaths made for special audiences. Necessary are only a few. For your consideration: Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles' 'Cidade de Deus' dealing with the eponymous 'City of God'. Initially the name of a housing project created by the Brazilian government in the 1960s, the result was abandoned by the authorities after its creation and turned out to be anything but what its name suggests. Taken over by drug lords crime is the way to get by in these favelas. Killings are everyday business, and they happen on the side of the police, on the side of the drug dealers, or among the people in the slums themselves by exchanging their arguments with weapons. Since its creation, children growing up in these areas have learned to be part of the violence - they are on the receiving end and they practice it without questioning. They live to survive.Meirelles's film is basically a documentary cloaked as film, based on Paulo Lins' real life accounts of what he witnessed himself, shot with actors who were picked from the slums. Unashamedly it covers full 20 years and shows all facets of violence that advance the spiral of death and destruction in the favelas. Meirelles uses state of the art cinematography combined with intentionally changing directorial styles in order to follow the various stages of despair and hopelessness. From the days of petty delinquents starting out where anything goes to gangs who commit mass murders, but are inevitably trapped in their doomed existence, Meirelles portrays the vicious circle with brutal honesty. 'City of God' is best appreciated in conjunction with the documentary 'News from a Personal War' (Lund/Salles) on the subject showing 10 year olds carrying AK-47s and police men who admit that they work in a war zone. Lots of funerals on both sides, no hope in between.",10,1,3,24 December 2012
The Elephant Man," About monsters and someone with a human soul
","'The Elephant Man' is not your typical eccentric brainy David Lynch flick, but it was the one that really launched his career as one of the most important filmmakers of today. It is also one of Lynch's most accessible films - realism and story go first. This highly commendable effort results in a very unusual biopic, following the true story of John (originally Joseph) Merrick, who lived in Victorian England of the 19th century, severely deformed from birth on. The picture steers a highly emotional course. For one it shows Merrick's life as a human curiosity, exhibited and exploited for his abhorrent looks, with his abnormality being celebrated, his helplessness greeted with violence to make the caged animal obey. Degraded to a mere creature, the abuse is physical and mental. But we also get to learn about a person named John, his other side, as one among others, who earns our respect as every human being does, regardless of race, belief, deformity, or any other prejudices. As with similar films where the horror is not merely a fantasy of its creators (take for instance Tod Browning's 'Freaks'), 'The Elephant Man' is serious material one cannot recommend enough to watch, as it will undoubtedly leave an impression. The way the soul of John Merrick is carefully unwrapped is just heartbreakingly executed, helped tremendously of course by the endearing performance of John Hurt. Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who harbors the unfortunate Merrick, fully delivers, as do Hannah Gordon, Sir John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft, who complete the supporting cast. There are very few movies out there which can offer you life altering experiences. 'The Elephant Man' might be one of them.",9,1,3,7 July 2012
Amadeus," Between the love and hate of God
","When it was suggested to Milos Forman to make a film about Mozart, one of the most famous classical composers, he was, well, reluctant. A period biopic with wigs and music of the 18th century didn't seem to be the right choice for him nor for a larger audience. Only when he saw Peter Shaffer's play, a highly fictionalized account of the rivalry of Mozart and the Viennese court composer Antonio Salieri, he immediately understood its potential - and turned it into a masterpiece. Strangely enough, the period biopic with wigs and decades old music became a box office hit as well...The reasons why 'Amadeus' succeeds, simply put: Shaffer knows how to write a dramatic story and Forman how to film it. The inaccuracies are easily forgiven and we soon accept Mozart as the ingenious but always broke goofball and Salieri as the scheming man in the background, driven by his simmering jealousy. Both of the leads, F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart, portray their characters with dedication, passion and unrelenting fervor when the script demands it - after 'Amadeus' they will always be remembered for those two roles. But a perfect production is more than the cast: Mozart's music of course stars prominently in the picture, placed in highly effective conjunction with cinematographic delicacies Forman serves one after the other sculpting Mozart's fragmented life into a magical whole. While plentifully used the composer's pieces are never repeated thematically, so that the viewer really gets a glimpse into the complete array of the genius' mind, into the playfulness, the love for his craft, the commitment he exudes, all assets on which his secret opponent eventually will break. 'Amadeus' might be a biopic paired with wild speculation, but it is highly dramatic yet entertaining, elevating and tragic. And high art - cinematographically, story-wise and musically divine.",10,0,1,22 November 2012
Mulholland Drive," A deep dive into a dream world - David Lynch at his very best
","Hollywood, the city where dreams come true. Yet the realities of the dream world have the tendency to eventually turn into a nightmare, a nightmare which is too real to be lived in... Welcome to a David Lynch picture, where nothing is as it seems, and Lynchian logic reigns to leave you befuddled, mystified, mouth agape when the curtain falls and silence spreads. Mulholland Drive is a movie which engulfs the viewer in its intricate mystery plot like no other and leaves you with a load of memorable, haunting or outright shocking images you will never forget. You might be caught off guard by the true nature of the underlying mystery, and the denouement will keep you mesmerized for sure, making a re-watch essential, yet rewarding experience. As often with an eccentric filmmaker's work, this is a movie to only get going in your head once it's already over, and if you're willing to get immersed in it.Lynch's masterpiece invites to dig deeper, to uncover new layers, hidden references, multiple interpretations. The film is as psychologically profound as it is visually stunning and while it draws its fascination from what appears surreal at first glance, it is nevertheless firmly embedded in a reality that won't let us go, blood-curdling as it might turn out, a reality full of hopes, dreams, obsessions, fear, you name it. 'Mulholland Drive' is packed with great imagery, dark humor, wonderful music and bizarre twists and turns and stars Naomi Watts in her most brilliant role. It's a blessing indeed that Mulholland Dr. as a TV series as Lynch original envisioned and pitched it, didn't happen and he had to rethink his ideas for a year - because that was when lightning struck. Pure movie magic. This one's a keeper.",10,17,23,24 December 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the brightest shining stars in movie history
","In hypothetical 2001 Stanley Kubrick takes you on a unique journey into the unknown, far out there in the vast reaches of our universe, where man is alone with himself - or is it? Paying close attention to scientific accuracy Kubrick's vision of the future feels so close to reality that it is still convincing many years after the year 2001 actually has passed, setting the benchmark way up for everyone else who should try to follow up with sci-fi approaches put to celluloid. But whoever might try their hands on a similar subject, the supreme beauty of what sprang from Kubrick's ingenuity will always be something to marvel at. Remember that the mother of all space operas was produced at a historic time shortly before man made his first step on the moon - and since then '2001' has remained the unparalleled sci-fi revelation not only due to its highly effective realism, but also its sophistication, depth and audio-visual magnificence, all rolled into one.Yet undoubtedly '2001' is so much more than just a perfectly executed sci-fi picture. It's a voyage dealing not only with space exploration, but also with evolution, belief, artificial intelligence, alien life forms, metaphysics, philosophy, in short: man himself, his aspirations and challenges - and tries to point into what lies beyond. Or - if you want - one can still enjoy the picture just as the ultimate adventure. Take your pick! Feel free to draw your own conclusions, but there's a lot to get out of this multilayered film, providing you are ready to put your mind to it. '2001' is a movie for the ages, a sublime experience of transcendency, a film that represents the epitome of art in terms of film-making, best summarized with one single word: a masterpiece.",10,0,1,24 December 2011
Once Upon a Time in America," Once upon a time there was Sergio Leone
","Sergio Leone's life-long struggle to make the perfect picture would eventually culminate in a crime fairy-tale on Jewish mobsters, aptly titled 'Once Upon a Time in America' (1984). And it would hold its ground despite heavy competition of Coppola's well received 'Godfather' films and the critically acclaimed Scorsese's gangster epics. Made 13 years after his previous picture, Leone's interlude as a producer didn't take away his passion to get the 'America' project that was in the pipeline finally going. Eventually it bore fruit and would also turn out to be his ultimate one, and maybe his best. In it the former master of spaghetti westerns takes the time to tell a multifaceted story and crams several whole gangster lives into a nearly four hour long epic, still complaining about essential 45 minutes that he was forced to cut. Well, that's Leone for you...At any rate the result is an operatic classic based on the quasi-autobiography of a gangster turned informant, packed with period details of the 1910s, 30s and 60s. It's a nostalgic trip through half a century with time as the key player that washes over the viewer like a mesmerizing, beautiful dream in an opium den, however at the same time feels like a violent nightmare commenting on themes of past vs. present, memory vs. dream, love vs. desire and above all betrayal vs. friendship. Add to the extensive script that was honed for years an array of beautifully photographed scenes, breathtaking Technicolor cinematography and a truly numinous score, and you've got yourself a masterpiece. For it all is married with such a tremendous amount of meticulousness for details that one can't help but get lost in the gangster world of Lower East Side of Manhattan. Aside from Leone's superb visuals, the accompanying music that links times and suggests themes needs special mention as it single-handedly raises the aesthetic level of the whole production by another notch. Created by Ennio Morricone, the famous memories evoking melancholic pan pipes not only fit the film's emotional ride through passing time, but also help to transcend it.The flashback story, with bits and pieces falling into place like in a jigsaw puzzle, is what makes the films so overwhelming, so emotionally intense. This time around a Leone picture however is not so much about landscape and close-ups, but about characters and their environment, the area they live in and their history. De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello let it all come alive. And at the side of the young Jennifer Connelly the 13 year old unknown Scott Schutzman Tiler plays the young version of the protagonist Noodles and nearly steals the older one's thunder, which is no other than De Niro. On the one hand the street urchin's lightheartedness shines in the character's youth while the veteran actor immerses himself so completely in the aging gangster that the weight of his past becomes almost palpable.Sergio Leone not only made Henry Grey - the man on which the story is loosely based - a larger-than-life monument, but also himself as a grand narrator of adult fairy-tales. Actually, 'Once Upon a Time in America' is two movies in one, and the overarching flashback structure makes it an unforgettable experience. All that of course was butchered on US release that sank the picture - even more reason to re-discover it as it was intended to be seen, in all its nostalgic glory.",10,3,7,27 May 2012
This Is Spinal Tap," They've cut the cheese and made it pastel black!
","Rob 'When Harry Met Sally' Reiner made this rockumentary back in 1984 when the idea to film a fictitious band's struggle with reality (their own included) was still pretty fresh. The feat was done several times after that, but there are reasons why 'Spinal Tap' still has survived them all. One of them is: It's downright hilarious, and another: The music is great. Plus: It's louder, ONE louder! Yep, that's because they have amplifiers that go to up to eleven!Played straight, a lot of it improvised, yet definitely not entirely invented, Reiner and company go for laughs which seem to be inherent in the music business they portray: Get ready for drummer combustion, bizarre deadly gardening accidents, sleek, pastel black covers, big bottoms and grave songs, then there's Artie Fufkin from Polymer Records, serious snack problems, managing wives, Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records, guitars you better not look at, well, it's all there. Even the literally cheesy trailer. Plus Artie Fufkin. From Polymer Records - have I mentioned that one?'Spinal Tap' is full of inside jokes and therefore repeated viewings pay off. That's why it's more than just fancy comedy, as it has its feet on the ground and knows what to spoof. And how. Classic.",9,0,3,27 December 2011
The Artist," The magical sound of a silent
","Starting off with visual quotes from ancient films like 'Metropolis' and 'Frankenstein' Michel Hazanavicius' 'The Artist' shouts its message right in your face: 'I won't talk!' In intertitles, that is. Yep, the protagonist means it. And he'll also stay in black and white. And in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. There you have it. Next stop: The silent era! And once we've arrived all of a sudden the period is alive and kicking like Frankenstein's monster, except that it will be sending jolts of joy through your body. What we have here is a magnificently unique idea, charming direction, a grandiose soundtrack, perfect costume design and Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo as the leads who must have time traveled to 2011 to be able to portray the 1930s and onwards so convincingly, as even without words their faces and gestures speak volumes.Cinema has gone through a lot in the past decades that gradually sucked art out of the medium: The breakthrough of the blockbuster in the seventies and the building of multiplexes in order to expand reaching and streamlining audiences, the growth of sensationalism for profit's sake, the inflationary distortions of reality spurred by ever present effects and increasing noise, the disappearance of the story in convoluted plots in order to be able to harbor some final surprises... Well, after all that a breath of fresh air is a blessing to anyone with a sincere love for cinema. 'The Artist' goes against the flow and restores some of the art without appearing artificial. Time for some pure back to the roots entertainment of the grand scale and with its simple yet poignant story the film doesn't strive to be anything but. While back in the days black and white was dictated by the medium's limitations, it also signified a filter, a style, which now again - brought back via a postmodern lens - helps to see things differently than we are used to in real life. Music, not words, floats through the air and the picture prefers to conclude with a tap dance rather than a twist for a twist's sake. In all that 'The Artist' serves as a reminder, a reminder of what we gain by taking a step back, by opening our eyes and ears to experience the beauty and the magic that reverberates in the sound of a perfect silent.",10,4,7,5 May 2013
Life Is Beautiful," Holocaust meets comedy and someone who can pull it off
","Question: Is there any conceivable way at all to combine the holocaust with comedy and get laughs out of it? Well, not really I'd say, not without completely sacrificing the unspeakable horrors the concept of organized mass murder stands for. One shouldn't even try. If you look closer at Roberto Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful' you will see that such an attempt isn't actually made either in this film. It's not about ridiculing Nazis, confronting them with their own absurdities or pretend to go along with their ideas to make the underlying idiocy apparent. This is just a means. Rather the film creates a parallel, carefree world alongside the horrific reality of the Nazis, which is upheld by the central character Guido (played by Benigni himself), a clown at heart. All this in order to keep up the illusion of a perfect world for his son Giosué in the face of impending doom. 'Ah, the train ride was no good,' the father admits to his son when they arrive at the concentration camp. 'When we go back we take the bus. I'll tell them!' And when young Giosué wants to quit what Guido has convinced him to be just a game, his father is the first one to head out: 'We're in the lead now, but well, we won't get the big prize then. Too bad.' And suddenly Giosué reconsiders.Roberto Benigni undoubtedly is a brilliant comedian. He's unforgettable e.g. in Jim Jarmusch's 'Night on Earth' as a crazy cab driver to name just one example, but unfortunately his talent is often wasted in various light comedies. Great opportunities arise rarely for comedians, but Benigni grabbed this one and put all his heart into it, as director and actor. Contrasting his slapstick humor with the stark, painful reality of the Nazi's final solution to the Jew problem is daring, risky and extremely difficult to pull off. Thanks, Roberto Benigni, for giving the impossible a try. Highest recommendations!",10,2,3,28 February 2012
A Clockwork Orange," Controversial, essential, brilliantly scored, wonderfully shot - a must-see!
","'A Clockwork Orange' is an ingenious film-makers's masterclass. It's a captivating high-speed ultra-horror tour de force, a raw, grisly plunge into violence, in-out sex, rape and murder, a fall into nothingness, there and back again, accompanied by doom a-knocking with the sound of the Funeral Marsh of Queen Mary. There's also lots of Ludwig van in between in a central role, making 'A Clockwork Orange' one of the best scored pictures of all time. The topic at hand is a sci-fi tale about gruesome violence based on Anthony Burgess' book, which director Stanley Kubrick made too frighteningly real for some, sugared by the film's aestheticism of violence, critics say he thus embellished despicable acts. This forced Kubrick to retract his own movie in the UK in order to prevent copycats from imitating the film - a circumstance, which of course only contributed to its undisputed cult status. 'A Clockwork Orange' was a risky undertaking, a film that stirred, shocked, repelled or was loved all for the wrong reasons, but there is no way around it any way you look at it.From the first hundred percent orange screen in movie history, to Malcolm McDowell's first shot revealing him sitting in the Korova Milk Bar with his droogies, to Jesus statues dancing thanks to changing camera angles and quick cuts and 'Singing in the Rain' - in every little moment of the movie there's no doubt that a master is at work.",10,0,1,24 December 2011
Three Colors: Blue," Liberation, your name is Juliette Binoche
","'Trois Couleurs: Bleu' often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected...'Bleu' is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.",10,1,1,1 April 2012
The Fountain," Romantic fantasy/sci-fi Rubik cube for those who like it different
","Darren Aronofsky's 'The Fountain' might be called all kinds of things: enigmatic, mystifying, intense, mind-bending, transcendental, and a lot of not exactly favorable attributes as common opinion suggests. Or a 'Rubik cube' as the director/writer himself puts it. Well, it's really not all that complicated actually, as the film revolves around a rather simple central story carrying the basic idea. However, the picture is put together and presented in a most unusual and unique way, and that's where the whole beauty and challenge lies. Aronofsky takes no prisoners, constantly references, quotes and hints at, but leaves it to the viewer to connect the dots and literally make the story whole. In short: If you expect a bit more from a film than a run-of-the-mill action-adventure drama/thriller with CGI participation you might as well get into the fascinating world that is 'The Fountain'. While framed by medieval romantically inspired fantasy and imaginative poetic sci-fi, the film is actually about none of these things and has its heart and soul elsewhere: in the present, deeply buried in the human condition searching for meaning in death, and life. Thus the film might seem like a weird incongruent and at the same time strangely familiar and intimate experience on the one hand, all of which reflects in its different timelines and its jumbled representation of events. On the other hand it is held together by familiar faces, playing similar characters, themes reverberate, intertwine, all for a reason - a concept leading up through labyrinthine paths to a deeply affecting denouement when everything comes together in the viewer's mind. Your turn! Keep it simple or add your own preferred twist - the material offers ample options.Undoubtedly 'The Fountain' is Aronofsky's most visually stunning piece aiming for grand scope that boldly follows no ready-made formulas of successful film-making - consequently it flopped at the box office. The picture found audiences strongly divided ever since, which is often the case at masterpieces. An indicator? Spirituality, enlightenment, a path of grace à la Malick/Tarkovsky meeting conquistadors and spacemen in biospheres? For your consideration. Or as Rod Serling might have said: Submitted for your perusal, a tale about two dreamers - two dreamers and an observer, with all involved imaginations being tested. Somewhere far out there... in the cinematic twilight zone.",9,1,3,13 June 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," When a man isn't around he leaves an awful hole, isn't he?
","Voted as the 'Most Powerful Movie of All Time' by the American Film Institute in 2006, Capra's masterpiece now seems redeemed once and for all after it had been considered a major disappointment at the box office back when it was released. Due to a clerical error (or should we better choose to say, divine intervention?) the film even went into public domain, and well, now that it can be shown by every station on the planet it has turned into the ultimate Christmas classic, all ages aboard. The picture might look a tad dated in parts, but on the other hand this is exactly what embeds this fantastic journey even better between fairy-tale and harsh reality. And thus it hits home when it is holiday season again, the Christmas tree is being decorated and the smell of ginger bread hangs in the air.'It's a Wonderful Life' is about standing up for the community, for principles, for family and friends, for those things that are important in life. Now that all might sound commonplace, but every now and then we need a serious reminder, so it might as well be in the Christmas season. The movie builds up magnificently to its final third, when everything goes downhill at the same time, and America's most favorite son-in-law James Stewart as George Bailey finally loses it. At this moment an already great character-driven movie turns magical when all threads come together and lead up to a breathtaking finale one isn't likely to get tired of. The climax is engaging, uplifting, heart-warming, and the all around great photography further enhances the effect. I can't say if Jimmy Stewart got his wings with this one, and he's probably already immortal anyway for many a reason. For sure he got his place in the audience's hearts with the film, and someone up there gave us the chance to revisit his struggle every year and teach us that after all one's better off being alive. Just remember: When a man isn't around he leaves an awful hole, isn't he?",10,1,2,6 September 2012
Psycho," 'Psycho' spells the ABC of horror
","The face of Anthony Perkins aka Norman Bates as the psycho has burned itself deep into the mindset of moviegoers since Hitchcock's horror thriller hit the silver screens in 1960. It's essential for a whole genre, as iconic and unmistakable as Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster in Jack Pierce's make-up and will be for many more generations to come. As far as horror movies go it can't get any better than this. Anthony Perkins remains stuck in your mind due to his nervously shy performance throughout most of the film, likable and odd at the same time, and the ice cold twist at the end makes perfect sense.But the film is much more than Perkins. It's Robert Bloch's excellent script, Bernard Herrmann outstanding score, and then there's the director. Hitch shows his handwriting as the master of suspense in every detail. The black and white cinematography of course is crucial and used to perfection in 'Psycho', the shadows and tilted angles contribute to an unnerving atmosphere. And who else would get rid of someone introduced as the protagonist after a third of the film? Or take the famous shower scene, where the master demonstrates his cutting edge editing abilities, literally. It's reduced to the necessary minimum, artistically composed for maximum effect. And the mise en scÃ¨ne of the final revelation, the secret that awaits in the basement? Heart-stopping. In short: 'Psycho' spells the ABC of horror, and rightfully so.",10,0,0,3 April 2012
To Kill a Mockingbird," A masterpiece about childhood, racism, prejudice, integrity and love
","'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of the few examples where novel and movie for one really have something to say and where both versions are outstanding achievements in their own right. Harper Lee's bestseller won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the movie - made with Lee's full support and produced with the same love for the material - received eight well deserved nominations for the Academy Award. The film won three, including Best Actor for Gregory Peck, a portrayal tailored so convincingly after Harper Lee's real life father that a lifelong friendship between actor and writer developed. Even Peck's granddaughter would bear the name 'Harper', to appreciate the mutual appreciation. Family is also on the forefront of the film: Peck really epitomizes the role of the Southern lawyer Atticus Finch who is set to defend a black man accused of raping a while girl, convinced of his innocence. Finch has two children he needs to teach values of humanity, and these are based on compassion, courage and fighting for the right cause - against all odds. Actor and character shared these principles, and it shows.What makes book and movie so special is that everything is seen through the eyes of the children rather than from a more objective perspective. That way the storytelling provides an unusual and fresh angle when we find ourselves stumbling into events more or less by accident and learn what's really at stake as the youngsters go along. Yet while Atticus' fight against prejudices may seem to be doomed, hope never dies - and it is a given that the viewer will walk away deeply moved by this picture. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a masterpiece about childhood, racism, prejudice, integrity and love, and it excels in dealing with all of the mentioned categories. Whether in form of the novel or the film, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' should be integral part of anyone's education.",10,0,1,24 December 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Rebel with a cause - McMurphy vs. Nurse Ratched
","Very few great films are just simple and straightforward, require no brain-twisting abilities from the viewer, can be enjoyed by practically anyone and have an inevitable impact that resonates deeply. Also one rarely finds films that are entertaining, dramatic, humorous, tragic and poetic all at the same time and on top of that have something to say which doesn't sound moralising. If you're looking for a picture which meets all those requirements 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' fits the bill.Awarded in 1975 with the magic five Oscars covering all main categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is one of the most effective anti-establishment parables which takes place in a mental hospital, where sane but rebellious Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy fights Nurse Ratched's (Louise Fletcher) authoritarian regime. The two main characters play so well off each other that one almost forgets the rest of the brilliant cast, among them Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito or the young Brad Dourif, but also not to forget the Native American Will Sampson. All of these inmates work well, because the actors were cast to play roles cut out for them. A flawless screenplay guarantees to be instantly drawn into the world created by Czech born director Milos Forman, and our sympathies soon lie with these characters, especially free spirit McMurphy. Yet sometimes the fight for the right thing is a lost cause from the get-go. We might even be aware of it. However, we learn from characters like McMurphy that - flawed as we are - we can have the heart at the right place, even against the odds. And that there's hope in every failure.",10,2,4,16 March 2012
Parasite," Parasite(s) and where to find them
","With 'Parasite' Bong Joon Ho goes for another exercise of social commentary, not unlike his praised 'The Host' (2006) - for those who cared for a monster movie dealing with social issues. It wasn't for everyone, though. Both films are 'so metaphorical' as 'Parasite' protagonist Kim Ki-woo likes to put it. But different strokes for different people, no? Certainly, the metaphors aren't on vacation this time around, it's just that they learned to profess some subtlety. As back then, Bong pulls out all the stops in 'Parasite,' and while the former picture's literally Godzillish rendition matching its ambitions makes it borderline, the new approach is hard to skip. It takes on the shape of a pitch-dark comedy with coarse edges when it counts. One might as well let one's self get immersed in it, enjoy the ride and laugh along, relish its twists and turns before receiving a blow from left field. 'Parasite' comes across as less pretentious, settles on the more down-to-earth (pun intended) side of things; it plants its seed with a much smaller dose of horror, is whimsical, ironic, even cynic at times; and it substitutes CGI for clever story-telling and cinematography measuring the highs and lows of the social ladder with visual precision. In short, ingredients for a less in-your-face, decisively creeping-up-on-you kind of comedy drama of caliber, falling into line with Bong's other early outstanding effort 'Memories of Murder.''Parasite' is an all-out visual genre mix of the first order, as much commentary about western society's underbelly and upper class as it is a ghost story drawing from a long Asian tradition. Things are in play that have always been lingering deep down underneath and come back to haunt us, metaphorically - and literally. In that sense the film is as much a thriller as it is fun stuff and dead serious drama, a bit like an attempt at squaring a circle, and yet it works.'Parasite' is also the ultimate staircase film, to name just one striking image. This owes itself to the implied fairy-tale lore that at the end of the staircase - society's equivalent for the romantic rainbow - you'll find a pot of gold, right? It's just that stairs work in both directions, and climbing them up or down is less romantic. Bong Joon Ho makes staircase construction his art and builds them vicious circle-like. Consider this circle squared.",9,5,8,15 February 2020
Paths of Glory," A pearl washed ashore by the tide of war
","There are lots of so-called anti-war films out there, which focus on showing the inhumanity of war by pointing the camera at soldiers who are shot, blown up, mutilated, that sort of thing. Often these movies lack the necessary reflection related to the shown violence, and assume that this already takes care of itself, and this is a really sad story. The result may lead the phenomenon that some people enjoy such movies because of what they see, not what the film is meant to be about. And thus it might be safer to call such movies 'war films' rather than 'anti-war'. Well, 'Paths of Glory' is different. It focuses on the individuals, the executors in the command chain, on those, who are forced to make decisions about life and death, those, who have to survive or make achievements against all odds, who therefore use others to save face.Kubrick's film is short, but very intense and poignant and goes far beyond the regular motion picture which just happens to be about war. It forces the main dilemmas of a stone-cold war machinery to the surface, where everyone has to play their role and humanity has no place in it, where absurdity is method. 'Path of Glory' is a benchmark as far as anti-war movies are concerned, and this also has to be said about one of the most touching final scenes ever. In it Kubrick immortalized his later wife, whose performance gets under one's skin and suggests to us that there are also humans fighting on the other side, caught in the very same inhuman war machinery. There are films that last more than three hours and fail to make a point about war - Kubrick only needs his German wife and three minutes to make this point.",10,0,1,7 January 2012
Mary and Max," Love letter to a friend - the best and only friend
","With the animation short 'Harvie Krumpet' (2003) creator Adam Elliot made his points - that stopmotion isn't out, that you can make a serious, heartbreaking and at the same time hysterically funny film about Tourette's Syndrome, and that the results of such an effort are indeed Oscar worthy. - Fast forward to 2009: Do Oscar winner Elliot's established points work in a feature film as well that has been five years in the making? Yes, even more so. 'Mary and Max', the unlikely friendship of a neglected misfit Australian eight year old girl and her middle aged pen pal from New York suffering from Asperger syndrome is definitely a highlight story-wise and animation-wise, and even excels oddball 'Harvie' by a mile.It all starts with chocolate being sent innocently across the ocean and a child's harmless questions being answered by a total stranger who doesn't have a grip on reality himself, but tries anyway. However, as this is no Pixar or Studio Ghibli film be prepared for the dark side of things to emerge when Mary grows older, Max fatter, and the relationship becomes strained and whole existences are being threatened. Fear not however, as form and content match the development beautifully and pull you in with charm, wit and pitch-perfect musical accompaniments that add flair and pace. The juxtaposition of the two different worlds is highly effective with New York in black and white and Mary's Australia in color but toned down. The latter appears more alive, Max on the other hand always follows regular routines: his life gets turned upside down only when a letter arrives, but deaths and lottery wins count only as footnotes. Not to forget: Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as the voice of Max) gives a first rank performance with side-splitting one-liners that could be enshrined for eternity. To sum it up: Elliot's second effort is bittersweet and complex, fluctuating between light and dark humor, but hilarious all around, full with well packaged social commentary, but most of all has a lot of warmth and depth, building up to an intense unforgettable finale. 'Mary and Max' is a clearly adult themed animation pearl, an emotional roller coaster ride. Not the typical feel good animation fare, but one that will sweep you off your feet with its very own and rather unique means.",9,1,3,3 November 2013
Blade Runner," Do androids dream of electric sheep?
","In 1968 science fiction writer legend Philip K. Dick posed a legitimate question, asking: Do androids dream of electric sheep? Well, do they? If the thought hasn't crossed your mind yet, feel free to give it a shot... And/or try the movie version of Dick's novel, where Ridley Scott tries as well to shed some light on the matter and force us to think. And rethink again. As 'Blade Runner' is indeed existential science-fiction in its purest form. Not mass audience compatible on its release, the film became cult nevertheless and Scott continued to make his own alterations, so the fifth cut was eventually labeled the final one. Voice-over, romance and additional side plots are either subdued in the current version or a thing of the past, while the central philosophical theme is now strongly emphasized, and the experience thus gets much more intense. 'Blade Runner' takes place in a 'retrofitted' future, in a society that has evolved, but where the intentions of the big corporations contrast with the squalor in the overcrowded streets of the megalopolis. This beautiful anti-future where man creates replicants in his own image in order to send them to dangerous, menial or leisure work on off-world colonies makes the perfect setting for the art form of neo-noir. Especially when some replicants are running wild. Time to make clear that their existence is limited.'Blade Runner's' cultural influence has been enormous. Its visual style constituted a model for many retro-future flics to come, the underlying themes proved fascinating and have held sci-fi fans in their grip until this day - plus there's that decisive extra where Scott begs to differ from Dick's novel. The movie version for sure brings us closer to answering Philip K. Dick's initial question: Do androids dream of electric sheep? After watching we might conclude: Yes, quite likely. But at the same time there's that new question that arises, which is: What's a replicant?",9,0,3,10 August 2012
Amélie," Angels have names too: this one's called Amélie
","Romantic comedies rarely make it to anyone's serious top ten list, as movies of that kind cater to specific expectations and do not attempt to be anything else. But of course there's the exception to the rule: Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amélie. It's the movie about the search for happiness, about small things, about dreams tucked neatly under the surface of reality which want out, also a training video for wanna-be mortal angels: Amélie is the ultimate reminder of carpe diem, to seize the day and play an active role in the fortune of others and one's self, providing instructions on how to glue together broken personalities. Recounted in voice-overs, embedded in fantastic music that is as French as it can be, the movie is filmed with an incredible love for detail and quirkiness a viewer can handle in two hours: Learn fascinating facts about nothing particularly important, appreciate how different things happen at the same time all around Paris, meet traveling garden-gnomes, horses riding in the Tour de France.Audrey Tautou was born for the role of jaunty Amélie, and she would work again with Jeunet in 'Un long dimanche de fiançailles' - however, you cannot copy the magic of the first film. Jeunet always takes risks with ideas, sometimes going too far in a direction the audience isn't ready to go with him. He should receive his merits for trying, though. Because every now and then idea, story, actors, combined with the incomparable image laden style Jeunet puts on the screen, come together, and the result is a film as breathtaking as Amélie.",10,2,5,24 December 2011
Rear Window," The ultimate triumph of imagination...
","'Rear Window' is proof that one can put an actor a whole movie in the same room, even the exact same wheelchair and follow his actions for two hours, and it's still a hell of a ride. Providing we have an actor who can carry the whole film on his own shoulders and tremendous direction. The director in question in this case of course is Alfred Hitchcock and his collaborator as actor is one of his favorite lead regulars, the humble, always likable hero by circumstance, Jimmy Stewart. As far as this minimalism is concerned: The great master of suspense did a very similar thing to 'Rear Windows' in 'Dial M for Murder' (also shot in 1954), where one single apartment serves as the focal point for the entire action, and suspense can boil in this closed environment until the lid bursts open.The vast set (a whole apartment complex plus courtyard!) built for this gem are one of a kind and there's the awe-inspiring beauty of the Technicolor cinematography, which along with the thrilling story, Stewart and Grace Kelly as the indispensable blonde makes this a quintessential Hitchcock film. And this in spite of the voyeurism that is portrayed, rather elegantly though - unlike it was the case with acclaimed director Michael Powell a few years later, whose 'Peeping Tom' would try to turn the tables and let the murderer be the voyeur, an artistic attempt that practically cost him his career. Hitchcock however appeals to the imagination of the viewer in his film and scores big with this idea. There's no need to break out and leave Stewart's character to show the actual crime, not even in a flashback: It's all right there in front of your eyes, just a thought away.",9,1,3,16 June 2012
Ran," Shakespeare, Kurosawa - a classic spectacle
","In Ran, one of Akira Kurosawa's last pictures, the legendary director once again returns to themes he has dealt with before in such impressive pictures as 'Throne of Blood' or 'Yojimbo', and these are: power struggle, arrogance, selfishness, greed, betrayal, suspicion, revenge, blackmail, battle upon battle, madness, death and tragedy. To sum it all up means to spell the title of this epic: 'Ran', which stands for 'Chaos', and this is exactly what you can expect when things get out of hand in a once thriving land. The film is a loose rendition of Shakespeare's 'King Lear' and begins with what an old warlord thinks to be a good idea: to abdicate and make room for younger blood. But his three sons have their own agendas and soon clash to decide upon the right of succession until everything that reminds of the once glory days is irretrievably gone.'Ran' lasts nearly three hours, has beautifully choreographed battle scenes, sharp dialog and is packed with lots of strong main characters: aspiring and falling warlords, conniving wives, a faithful, wise jester, a symbolic blind man on the edge of a cliff, to name just a few... Unlike the mentioned Samurai movies, 'Ran' was shot beautifully in color and features hundreds of extras, making the film one of Kurosawa's most visually stunning movies. If you like it monumental, you can't get past this one.",10,1,3,23 May 2012
The Thin Red Line," A breathtaking, different kind of war movie
","Released in 1998, the same year as blockbuster 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Thin Red Line' was doomed from the get-go. If you're looking for the bigger names, be it actors or director, or want to see fast paced action, or even just the plain old high budget Hollywood war movie, this is not it. Everyone else is welcomed into this different kind of film, which some say isn't even a proper war movie. That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it is true that 'The Thin Red Line' approaches the topic from an entirely different angle, or from multiple angles to be precise. Malick highlights lives, struggles, hopes and dreams of various people, helps us look through their eyes of what transpires on the battlefield and how it reflects on them and their relationships to those who share their unreal experiences.But it's not just the soldiers who play major roles in what transpires on screen, it's nature itself which is there and prominently so, it is always there, regardless of what gruesome deeds man decides to commit in its very heart. Sky, clouds, winds, grasses, animals, plants, man, the latter is just one of those things, a part of it, a necessity or a burden, judge yourself. Maybe there is even a subtle point somewhere as well when we see big names like Travolta and Clooney cast yet appearing only for one or two minutes or so. They are not important. But this film is.",10,2,4,24 December 2011
The Wizard of Oz," There's no place like home
","Fantasy movies of today are generally escapist extravaganzas of uncompromising pace. They show everything for real what kids once didn't even dream of imagining - they are graphic, loud and if there's a morality lesson to be learned from it at all it's sugar-coated beyond recognition. The musical classic 'The Wizard of Oz' is different. Starting off on a farm in Kansas, a plain kind of reality shot in black and white awaits. A genuine surprise move for its time the film then dives into the Technicolor fantasy world of Dorothy's dream, only to eventually emerge back where we set out - in the reality of life, unchanged in color, but full with experiences gained from the journey enriching what once seemed drab and plain. Thus the 'Wizard of Oz' is a coming of age movie that deals with anxieties and how to overcome them - with a bit of brain, heart and courage things are half as frightening as they seem, and we are reassured that even wizards are just plain human.'The Wizard of Oz' based on the timeless children book classic by L. Frank Baum however is much more than a film only children would enjoy - it's a treat for all ages. The action and the music are heart-lifting, the film is funny, entertaining, fascinating, the tale's metaphors are deep enough to appeal to everyone and it still holds up many years after its release back in 1939. Take for instance Roy Bolger's famous scarecrow dance, Judy Garland singing 'Somewhere over the rainbow' and the final scenes with trusted faces and the realization that there's no place like home, despite all the problems and troubles. Well, sometimes it helps to take the shortcut through fantasy land to get to the real thing. Here's one way.",10,3,4,31 July 2012
