The Hangover," The funniest movie of the year!
","I just got back from viewing The Hangover, a movie I had never heard of until yesterday when I saw a commerical on television and several positive reviews. I'm really glad I saw this because I had so much fun.Of all the actors in the movie, they were all exceptional but the one that really stood out and stole the show was definitely Zach Galifanakis. Somehow I had not been familiar with his standup routine but in this movie he was hilarious. It's a heavily quotable movie and 95% of the quotes that are going to be repeated would be things that he said. All four (or 3) of them worked together with so much chemistry, actually having me believe at times that I'm watching real friends.The plot was totally absurd, but that was sort of the point. The audience is in on the joke that we don't even know what they possibly could have done last night and it's a great mystery to unravel every tiny detail of it and laugh because it's exceptionally bizarre.The only complaint I could have was that it started off a little slow, like maybe the first 25 minutes until they wake up with The Hangover. After that point, the laughs keep coming but the first quarter may persuade people to walk straight out of the theater.This is without a doubt the funniest movie of the year and destined to become a classic. What could beat it? Year One? The Proposal? Nah. Maybe Funny People.",7,1,3,15 June 2009
Star Trek," Not just for Trekkie's!!!
","This movie completely blew my socks off. Coming in to the movie, I had no knowledge of anything Star Trek related. I never saw any of the series or any of the movies, simply because it never interested me. I hate hearing all that technobabble that always is going to give me a headache because it's filled of all these imaginary space words.So since I'm new to the series, I have to say I was skeptical about this movie because I thought it was going to be the same thing. This is being called a reboot and gosh darn it delivers on that promise because it completely brings a totally dead franchise back to life, a franchise that I never cared for but I want a sequel all of a sudden.I like this because it related to me. When I knew about the TV Series it was people that were in space, I never considered the fact that they might be from Earth. But, this movie set that up that it is their homeland, so I am able to imagine actually going on the Enterprise.The actors talk so modern too and it feels so natural. It was almost if JJ Abrams filmed real people in the role and didn't force anything. That's perfect casting all around.This has to have had the best soundtrack of the year. Very, very catchy score. I await for another Star Trek movie and have become a Trekkie. I am also now a fan of director JJ Abrams so make more movies because they are exceptional.",10,2,14,15 June 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino finally topped Pulp!
","I've been anticipating this movie for a long time. Basically, the impression I had of this movie was that it was supposed to be a Dirty Dozen style action movie of Jews on a mission to kill Nazis. This sounded similar to Valkyrie which just came out at the end of 2008, but I would see it because I consider myself to be a Tarantino fan.I've seen Pulp Fiction which is one of my favourite movies of all time because it's so awesome. I've seen Jackie Brown which was rather entertaining and a good movie, but it didn't live up to Pulp Fiction's standards. I've also seen Death Proof which was the second half of Grindhouse. I definitely preferred Planet Terror to Death Proof because I thought the dialogue in Death Proof was rather boring. Tarantino kills off every character after hearing them chat about pointless things. I did, however, enjoy the second half of Death Proof.Inglourious Basterds is the first time that I feel that Tarantino has come close to the quality of Pulp Fiction. I will even go as far as saying that Inglourious Basterds is my favourite Tarantino film.The plot of Inglourious Basterds isn't as simply as you might have seen from the trailer. There is a subplot about a Jewish girl whose family is killed early into the movie by Nazis for hiding under the floorboards of their neighbours. She escapes from Col. Hans Landa (played by Christoph Waltz) and we see her four years later when she owns her own theater that is hosting a Nazi premiere. The main subplot involves a group of Jewish American soldiers called The Basterds who are just killing and scalping any Nazi they meet. When they find out that Hitler is attending the premiere, the subplots eventually meet which is closer to the end of the movie. When this happens, I can honestly say that it is the most entertaining scene in any movie I've ever scene.Everyone assumes that the movie is all about The Basterds and Brad Pitt, but they don't even get a lot of screen time. I think the real star of the movie is Christoph Waltz who plays The Jew Hunter. He's such a great antagonist and is convincingly evil, even when he's just drinking a glass of milk. Everyone in the movie gave a great performance, and many were surprisingly comedic. But we've come to expect that from Tarantino movies.The most important thing is not to expect an action film, or you'll be severely disappointing because it's a 2 ½ hour movie and 2 hours and 15 minutes of that is probably pure dialogue. Even the dialogue itself is mostly in subtitles translating German, French or Italian. It was my major complaint with Death Proof but for Inglourious Basterds it managed to improve the movie. Still, when there is an intense action scene it doesn't disappoint especially with the final 20 minutes of the movie.To conclude this review, I strongly believe that Tarantino made an exceptional World War II film, the best one I've ever seen, as well as for Tarantino and I think this will be known as one of the classic films of the decade.It's hilarious when it needs to be, it's tense when characters are talking for 20 minutes at a time, and when it's gory it's exciting. Seriously, you can be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie, if you're enjoying. I know this is sort of a love it/hate it type of movie and hopefully more people will love it and see the movie in the way I did. I saw it twice and this is actually one of the rare times where I feel that I enjoyed it even more the second time. The second time, you are aware that people are eventually going to stop talking and when. You know the purpose of it all and the main timeline of the movie. You may even be able to spot things that you never noticed before.I won't hesitate in giving Inglourious Basterds a 10/10, it's a perfect movie and easily my favourite film of the year.",10,2,9,1 September 2009
Public Enemies," A bit slow, but good overall.
","It stars Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. This movie takes place in the 1930's and is about John Dillinger who was a bank robber and the last 18 months of his life. Johnny Depp plays Dillinger and he was a very good choice for the role because he looks very much like him, but not as much as Leonardo Di Caprio would have. Since Johnny Depp has done so many great roles, I can't say that this is his best but it's just another great role for him and a great performance. Maybe it can fall in his top ten.Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis and spends the whole movie hunting down Dillinger and trying to put him behind bars. Christian Bale is actually a great actor despite his recent years. The Dark Knight was a great movie, but it wasn't because of his performance. It's great to see that he's not using the Batman voice anymore like he was using in Terminator: Salvation.Everyone else was solid.This in definitely a great movie, but unfortunately it is a little bit flawed. The gun battles are amazing and the gun shots are very loud and realistic like it's supposed to sound. If there's something you can expect in a Michael Mann directed film, it's that it will have great gun shot sound effects. If you don't like loud noises, I don't recommend it.However, there is this one gun battle that takes place in the forest that's probably about 15 minutes long. Way too long in my opinion and I started getting bored at that point about an hour and a half into the movie. But, it managed to pick up near the end.A major complaint that I'm hearing is the constant use of HD video. The entire movie is actually shot with hand-held cameras which is said to have a negative effect on the film. What these cameras did was make several parts of the movie much more blurry when you would like to be able to see, darker and and whole lot noisier. Personally, I wasn't bothered too much by the use of the cameras. They actually are able to make you feel that you're part of the action, which is great. They are still a bit unnecessary, because the movie could have been shot with film, but I didn't enjoy the film any less because of it.Also, this movie had a very good soundtrack. It seemed to go very well with the visuals and was a great selection of the best tunes of the 30's, which I am not familiar with.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I would give it a 7.5/10, brought down because it was slow for about 25 minutes but it managed to pick up again. You'll be entertained, but if you actually want to learn about the life of John Dillinger, that's not what you'll get. What you'll be seeing on the screen is only his time robbing banks. If you really want to learn more than you can browse Wikipedia, which is always available. That's my review of the film and I was helpful.",8,1,2,6 July 2009
Orphan," A very dark and effective, but cliché horror film.
","Orphan is a horror thriller about a couple who decide to adopt a kid after having a miscarriage, so they decide to adopt Esther, a wonderful, talented and gifted child. After some bad things start to happen they eventually realize that there is probably something wrong with Esther. Telling you what's wrong with Esther would be a spoiler but I have to say it was the best twist I've seen all year and if anyone says that they saw it coming then they're lying. There's no way anyone saw that coming. Yes, the plot is extremely over the top and cliché for a horror film but I happen to think that the cheese factor really helps to keep this movie entertaining.I'm now going to talk about the performances in Orphan. The movie stars Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard who really are two of the best actors in Hollywood today. For this type of horror movie, you really wouldn't expect such respected actors. However, they really seem to be very into their roles, which is terrific and they were never over the top. It's even produced by Leonardo Di Caprio, so maybe it isn't just going to be a mindless horror film with terrible acting and it really didn't. Esther was played by 12 year old Isabelle Fuhrman. It certainly helps that she isn't a big name child actress, so that she is more believable and terrifying as Esther. Her Russian accent really adds to her creepiness. The things that she did in this movie were insane and hopefully she will be able to become a classic horror villain.Even though I enjoyed the movie, there were some parts that I laughing at the silliness of it. This is not a perfect movie and it has some major flaws. First of all, almost everything about this movie was extremely cliché and not entirely original. The plot of an evil child and bad seed was been done many times before and it's been done a lot better, such as in The Omen. There's a few scenes in the movie where a woman opens the mirror and no one's there, but when she closes the mirror someone appears and it's supposed to scare us. That cliché has been overdone to the max, to the point that it's not scary anymore. They did the same thing with a refrigerator and even used music. It was a very anti-climatic scare. The movie wasn't that realistic either. I don't actually think that they would have kept Esther for such a long time after all the bad things that kept happening. You have to just go with the movie, even if it's in a realistic world. Not everything is going to make sense and if you keep that mentality then you can enjoy the entertainment. The twist, however, was probably the most original thing about the movie as unrealistic as it may be. I actually knew about the twist before I saw the movie because I didn't think I was going to see it. I definitely regret that, but it didn't ruin the experience at all. If you can, don't find out the twist before you see the movie because you'll have a better time.Orphan is a very effective and delightfully dark horror movie that you should definitely try to see and it's just an easy way to escape from reality and be entertained for 2 hours. I'm going to give this an 8/10. You should see this.",8,2,3,8 August 2009
500 Days of Summer," For once, an original and hilarious romantic comedy
","Let me start off by saying that I absolutely can't stand romantic comedies. I think they're unoriginal and boring. However, there have been some good romantic comedies especially the ones that focus more on the comedy and less on the romance. The exception with 500 Days of Summer is that it is told in the male's point of view and that was what was most intriguing to me. This was what distinguished the movie from any other brainless romantic comedies that might as well star Sandra Bullock, Kate Hudson or Matthew McConaughy. 500 Days of Summer was described as an anti romantic comedy. It's not a love story, but a story about love and I think that's why it's so appealing.The main character is Tom, played by Joseph Gordon Levitt, meets Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel who Tom believes to be the one. We learn that Summer doesn't believe in love, but Tom does and that can be used to frustrate Tom or anyone watching the film because it is in his point of view.The movie follows the 500 days that they spent together in no particular order. The movie literally starts a 488 and then jumps to day 1 then to 250 then to 4. It sounds like it's going to confusing but it actually wasn't. The story is going to jump all over the place and you have to be aware that this is going to happen quite frequently. This is what keeps the movie creative and original.The performances in the movie were outstanding. Joseph Gordon Levitt definitely surprised me in this whole because I haven't seen him act in anything that wasn't comedic before. I recently saw him in GI Joe as the main villain and thought he gave a terrible performance. But in this I was able to care about his character and feel all of his emotions. Zooey Deschanel also surprised me. The last movie I saw her in was Yes Man, in which I thought that she gave a lazy performance and appeared like she wasn't paying attention for some reason. She plays the character effectively because you start off liking the character and then by the end, you will think she's evil. It's not that often that a I can change my opinion of a character so quickly, but she pulled it off. The only other performances that are worth mentioning are the Tom's coworkers who were there to support him and be humorous, even though their not big name actors. None of their jokes fell flat for me and I was constantly laughing at them. I didn't expect the movie to be so funny.It was directed by Marc Webb and 500 Days of Summer is actually his first film. He actually used to do music videos and he even uses that skill in the film. Half way in to the movie there's a very well choreographed dance scene where everyone is dancing in the streets that felt like a music video. When this part comes in the movie it's very unexpected, but it is very funny to watch.The main problem with romantic comedies is usually a bad script. That's not the case here because everything is so clever and intelligent, that it's so delightful to watch. It's written to be more realistic. When they first meet, it is very awkward and that would usually be what would happen in real life. The script writers previously wrote The Pink Panther 2, which shows that they must not be consistent because that was terrible and dumb. Hopefully, they'll be able to top this film because it was excellent and for a first time director, it's a big achievement.There's one scene in particular that I really enjoyed. Tom was attending a party and was imagining his expectations for it. For an entire 3 minute scene, there is a split screen with the right side showing expectations and the left side showing the reality. It's very interesting to pay attention to both screens and this is the originality I'm talking about.To conclude this review, I'm going to give 500 Day of Summer a 10/10. I think it was one of the best films I've seen all year and the best romantic comedy I've ever seen period. I really hope it gets nominated for a Best Picture. I think everyone should see it because it's too good to miss and I know people aren't going to give it a chance because it's an independent movie and it's not playing everywhere, but I recommend it even if you just want to be put in a good mood for 90 minutes.",10,1,3,27 August 2009
District 9," A brilliant science fiction/action film.
","I had very strange expectations for this film. It was originally shown in the trailer to be a documentary or mockumentary. Generally, I don't see those types of movies but in this case it was a very interesting way to tell the story. It also looked like there was going to be a lot of shaky-cam which I feel got old after Cloverfield. There wasn't as much of that as I expected. Now the trailers gave very little information as far as the plot goes.The story is basically about an alien spacecraft that lands in South Africa and after a few decades the people decide to send them away to a concentration camp known as District 9 because of their hostile behaviours. There's a lot more to the story, but that shouldn't be revealed before you see the film.The main star of the film is a complete unknown. Sharlto Copley from South Africa. I don't think it matters that District 9 has no major stars, these people are all South African and give great performances. It's directed by Neill Blomkamp who is a first time director and produced by Peter Jackson.The reason I thought District 9 was an effective film was because it was going a different direction with the alien movie. In all alien themed movies in the past, the aliens have been the enemies. In District 9, we are the enemies. I refused to believe that I would actually be rooting for the aliens in this movie, but District 9 achieved it. In my theater, there was applause when a group of aliens ripped a human apart. That's another thing. It's actually a surprisingly gory movie. It's not too bad but it could be quite bloody at times and you should be aware of that.The special effects were amazing on this film. It's hard to believe that they made the aliens look completely realistic on a 30 million budget. That was just incredible.My major complaint with the movie was that the first half hour was strictly a documentary and then after that it suddenly becomes more about the characters. It's too sudden when the documentary ends and it changes the tone because I was really enjoying the documentary. Also in a way, I'm glad it ended because it became it became a very entertaining action movie at that point.To conclude my review, I think you should see District 9. It's definitely the best summer blockbuster because it even has a few things to say about xenophobia and racism. I saw it twice, but I don't think it's necessary, once is enough to absorb all the information in the movie. Although, the final shot of the film completely flew over my head both times, but once I figured it out, the movie was so much better in my mind. I give District 9 a 9/10.",9,10,17,31 August 2009
Paranormal Activity," It does a lot with very little!
","Paranormal Activity is a horror movie that is basically found footage of a couple, Micah and Katie, who decide to tape the paranormal events that are happening in their home. It's very low budget and is very similar to The Blair Witch Project except it all takes place indoors and it's much better.As you might know, Paranormal Activity has a very large amount of hype behind it. What most intrigued me about the film were the rave reviews from critics. One review even went as far as saying that it was the scariest film of all time. This quote is probably what most of the hype was generated from. Now that I've seen it, I don't think that it is the scariest film ever, although you might be able to say that it was the scariest of the decade. It doesn't even get intense until the last 20-25 minutes, but it's very creepy and suspenseful all the way through. It's really impressive how people are saying that it's so scary when there are barely any scares. There's a scene in the movie where Micah and Katie are sleeping with the camera running and the door moves slightly. When that happened, everyone in the theatre was shaking because they were expecting something really shocking to happen. When you can get people getting scared by the smallest things in your movie, it has to have some excellent suspense.The performances were also solid. Everyone acted like a normal person may act in a home video. All of the dialogue was actually improvised, but I could even tell because the actors had great chemistry. They were completely believable as an actual couple.I really enjoyed how well the film was edited and it was especially impressive for such a low budget. I really liked how the movie only showed the night scenes in a time lapse, only stopping for important moments. This kept the movie more interesting and run along much faster, because the beginning was somewhat slow but it wasn't a major issue. In the movie, you are calm during the daytime and the movie suddenly becomes tenser at night. I liked how they used comic relief during the day to keep the least interesting bits of the movie more entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised by how funny it was. This time was also used efficiently for character development, which helped me care for the characters, even though Micah wasn't really that likable.Paranormal Activity is a film that must be seen in theatres. I believe that it's an experience in the theatre, that can't be compared to watching it at home on DVD. Watching it with a huge crowd is amazing because you feel what they are feeling. If someone makes a sound, you will be able to hear it because the movie is so quiet. For me, hearing a crowd react to a shocking moment in a horror movie makes the scares more satisfying. However, this could backfire because obnoxious people may be screaming and cracking jokes at inappropriate times. They usually shut up when the film catches their interest again which can't be too long because the movie is so exciting. Seeing a door move slightly isn't going to be scary when watching the film online, because it lacks the theatre experience.To conclude this review, I thought that Paranormal Activity was one of the scariest movies I've seen in a very long time, but that's only if it's seen in theatres.",9,0,1,28 October 2009
Drag Me to Hell," The best horror movie of the decade.
","Drag Me To Hell was a truly unique horror movie met all expectations and exceeded them. The trailers really just made the movie look bad, but the movie itself has so much humor that really needs to be seen to be believed. At any point during the movie, I never felt that this was a watered down film. It's not the type of movie where people are dying every few minutes and doesn't need the gore or the R-rating. The movie was actually truly scary and I can't even say that about some of the slashers that came out this year. Any movie that makes you jump just when they show the title and begin the opening credits is just amazing. Also, the movie ended at the best place to end it and never went on for too long. I had a better time with Drag Me To Hell then I did with Up, but Up was still great. It's just a special treat to have two great movies in one weekend because there's definitely been a post-trek drought.",10,1,5,14 June 2009
Zombieland," Funny Zombies and such.
","Zombieland is the next entry to the horror comedy genre. It is directed by Ruben Fleischer who did some episodes of Jimmy Kimmel Live, but no movies. It stars Jesse Eisenberg who was in Adventureland earlier this year, which I thought was a very good film. It also has Woody Harelson in a rare comedic performance and he's brilliant in it. It also stars Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone. The acting is of course very high quality especially considering that 3 cast members are Oscar nominated actors.The plot is very simple. The movie takes place in a time where the zombie apocalypse has occurred and America is now known as Zombieland. Columbus, who is played by Jesse Eisenberg has his own rules or surviving Zombieland and he's actually doing pretty well by himself. That is until he meets Tallahassee played by Woody Harelson and they agree to travel together to their destinations. Along the way they meet two sisters who are constantly stealing their car. The whole movie, they are travelling to their destination stopping to kill zombies. They are travelling to a Hollywood amusement park that is supposed to be zombie free.It is important to note that that these aren't traditional zombies, but they are living people that have been infected with mad cow disease that has become mad human disease. It really isn't a big deal because there have been several great zombie films with this angle, such as 28 Days Later. I like that there isn't much of a plot to Zombieland because that leaves a lot of time for some really intense action scenes and jokes even though the movie is only 81 minutes long. It may sound too short but the movie itself is so satisfying that it feels like the perfect time.Zombieland worked for me on so many levels. It happened to be the funniest film I've seen in a very long time. Not a single joke fell flat for me. I think this has the potential to be a comedy classic for years. Before Zombieland, I would say that the best zombie comedy was Shaun of the Dead, but I think it was a little funnier than Shaun of the Dead and a lot more fun. There's also an amazing cameo mid-way into the movie that has to be the best cameo in years. The audience was applauding during this epic cameo. I'm not going to be spoiling it here because it will not have the same effect if you already know who it is. The movie also had a good amount of gore and you could tell that it wasn't CGI. I was pleased that they didn't have too much CGI gore because it looked really fake and cheesy in some of the movies that were used in My Bloody Valentine and The Final Destination. That's all I have to say about Zombieland. I think it will appeal to different people. Both comedy fans and horror fans will both love this movie because there is a balance of both in here, though if I would have to pick one I would think that it is more of a comedy than a horror because everything is played for laughs. You shouldn't miss the best comedy of 2009. I give Zombieland a 9/10.",9,1,4,5 October 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not worth your time.
","This movie is the sequel to the 2007 adaptation of the Transformers toys and cartoon series. The plot is exceptionally awful. Basically Sam Witwicky is going off to college. At the same time the Decepticons are planning an attack on the Autobots and a whole war is starting up. Sam finds that he still has a piece of the Allspark cube that was destroyed in the first movie and when he looks at it the symbols get imprinted into brain, which the Decepticons are after. Also, another unrelated part of the story involves a robot named The Fallen who wants to destroy the sun with a machine hidden in the pyramids. I didn't fully understand the plot, therefore I won't be able to explain the entire plot. These elements in the script are really not related and you can tell one story being completely dropped and forgotten about.The acting in this movie is never a requirement but I'm still going to comment on it. I thought that Shia LaBeouf actually gave a great performance in this movie and he's definitely overqualified for Transformers. If he were to be in a drama, he would be great.Now, Megan Fox is only in the movie because she's hot and that may be true, however she's a terrible actress.John Turturro who actually has a much larger part in this movie than he has in the first film. He's clearly in the movie as a comic relief and the jokes involving his character are sometimes very absurd.Getting off the topic of performances, I would like to mention that the action in this movie is bigger and better than the first film. There's so much more robots fighting if that's what you're into. The CGI is also incredible with the very detailed robots. There are many parts to them, but this could be a disadvantage because a lot of them look like a bunch of metal pieces stuck together with faces. However, you could tell that the budget was very large on this movie because there's practically a new thing exploding in every scene. By now this is Michael Bay's trademark and it can really get old quickly.There were some improvements in this movie that really bothered me in the first movie. The major improvement was that Michael Bay actually managed to keep the camera still for a lot of the movie, so I can actually tell exactly what was going on in a robot fight. In the first movie, he would constantly be moving the camera and you wouldn't be able to tell what was going on. However, there was one scene where Shia LaBeouf's character is saying goodbye to his girlfriend played by Megan Fox before he goes to college and the camera constantly circles very fast and it really wasn't necessary.The difference is that the plot was a pretty good in the first movie around all the action sequences. In the sequel, the story is much worse as I have mentioned before. One part that bothered me is when Shia LaBeouf left college suddenly and never came back after only being there for a few minutes. We never saw that again and it was never explained if he ever even went back.When I was reading the reviews before I saw the movie, everyone was mentioning The Twins who were extremely racist stereotypes. A lot of the things they said were too offensive and crude but they didn't offend me that much. I didn't like the addition of the gold teeth and the fact they couldn't read, but other than that they made me laugh. They just didn't need as much screen time as they were given.The biggest problem with Transformers 2, is that it is way too long. It's about 2 & ½ hours and just six minutes longer than in 2007. This movie could have easily trimmed out a half hour just from the useless comedy scenes and maybe it would have been bearable. I started looking at my watch about an hour and a ½ in. I would even stop paying attention to the action sequences because I had become so bored near the end that I just wanted it to be over.I would also like to talk about the IMAX. I honestly can't say that it's a good idea to watch it in IMAX. You assume that it's a bigger screen and more enjoyable but for most of the movie it's only using the middle of the screen with some specific scenes that are shot with an IMAX camera. I'll have to admit that the IMAX shots were incredible and really made me feel like I was actually there with them in the desert. When it's being used, it's even more impressive than 3D, it's just that it's not used enough to pay five dollars extra for a ticket.Overall, I can't honestly say that I enjoyed the movie more than the first one, so I guess that means I believe the first movie was better. I'm fine with that, it's just that I still didn't like the first one because it was boring and had similar flaws this movie had. Overall, this is just a bad franchise and I actually wouldn't mind if I never see a third one. Even if they improve it, there's no more stories left to even keep it interesting.So, that's my review of the film. I give it a 5/10, and I personally don't recommend it. However, if you're a big fan of explosions than this is the movie for you. What should you see instead if you don't like explosions? Probably The Hangover again.",5,3,9,27 June 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Pure Dumb Fun!
","Law Abiding Citizen is a hardcore action/suspense film starring Gerald Butler and Jamie Foxx. The movie begins with Clyde (Butler) being portrayed as a family man. His wife and daughter are murdered less than two minutes later. Nick Rice is a district attorney who arranges a plea bargain for one guilty man to be executed and the other to spend a few years in prison. We cut to 10 years later, when Clyde is able to rig the execution, giving him a painful death. He also tortures and murders the man who set free and is arrested promptly afterwards. In prison, Clyde makes a series of demands that must be granted or else he will start killing people. How he somehow manages to kill people while he's locked up is a mystery, but that's what makes the film so damn entertaining.The intense plot description above would normally sound like spoilers, but all this happens in the first half hour and is all revealed in the trailer. You might also notice that Clyde's intentions are very similar to Dexter's. He is taking the law into his own hands when he's not pleased with the outcome of a trial. I normally wouldn't mind this, but there were a lot of noticeable aspects, such as when Clyde shows the pictures of his family to his victim. At least it had a unique twist on that when Clyde takes his time to torture his victims and leaves everything behind as evidence.Law Abiding Citizen is directed by F. Gary Grey. He did The Italian Job, which I thought to be a high quality remake. Although, he also did the mediocre Be Cool. He doesn't make the greatest films, but they're definitely not terrible. I didn't have a problem with his directing, I thought it was a very well made suspense film. As for the acting, Jamie Foxx has been better in the past. This isn't another Oscar worthy performance from him. Gerald Butler seems to be perfect for this role, though. These kinds of roles that he plays in movies like this, 300 and Gamer are so much better roles than the awful romantic comedies he's been doing recently. I don't understand how anyone thinks that these action movies are ruining his reputation as a romantic lead, when it's exactly the opposite. As a critic, I think that this is a fairly difficult film to review. On one hand, it's very dumb. On the other hand, it's highly entertaining, even exhilarating at times. It's difficult to know which one is more important here. The critics here clearly have sided on one angle giving it 22% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. I'll have to disagree with the consensus there. When I pay for a ticket, I would want to have a good time. I will try anything to have a good time, but if I can't then I just don't like the film. In a movie like Law Abiding Citizen, you just have to turn your brain off and be genuinely entertained. Just train yourself to laugh at cheesy one-liners and plot holes. Some of the worst films of all time also may happen to be the most fun to watch with the redeeming quality of unintentional comedy. People praise these films for their many flaws and that's exactly what should become with Law Abiding Citizen, but to a smaller scale.To get an idea of the dumb scenes can be found anywhere in the film. For some reason, Gerald Butler gets naked before he gets arrested, which isn't mentioned at any point in the film. Also, when the film jumps forward 10 years later, the characters either look even younger or exactly the same. It's not believable that they would look like that after 10 years. I also hated the ending. It was just very satisfying and unsatisfying. The ending brought the movie down for me. There was even a scene where they said the title of the movie like they were winking at the audience. Although, I'll have to admit there were some pretty clever plot twists and kills. The movie even made me jump at certain points.To conclude this review, I'll definitely recommend Law Abiding Citizen for the entertainment value and the fine performance from Gerald Butler. I'm going to give Law Abiding Citizen an 8.5/10.",8,1,3,3 November 2009
