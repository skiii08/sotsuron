The Devil's Advocate," Dynamic Performance
","I have seen this movie approximately 20 times, yes 20 times, and none of the luster has worn off.  Al Pacino is at his best with a convincing portrayal as the devil in disguise.  The balance of the cast, especially Charlize Theron, handled the supporting roles in classic fashion.  The ending of the movie had more twists and turns than the Indianapolis 500 Speedway. Pacino is masterful and his in-your-face analysis of power-hungry achievers makes you wonder if this is fiction or reality.  The special effects are incomparable. A must see.",9,0,0,25 September 2000
