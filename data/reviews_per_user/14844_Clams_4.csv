Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A novel film for its' time, and marvelous entertainment
","On the Special Edition DVD of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', one of the animators says he was talking to another animator in 1986, who told him, 'This movie is two years away and I'm scared right now.' The guy confessed he was too. And frankly, I don't blame them one bit, considering this was the first film to combine live action with animation, and in the eighties of all decades. One false move, this could have been worse than Plan Nine From Outer Space. Thankfully, they got Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg behind this, who know how to make good, quality (and hit) films, and I don't think they could have made a better movie.Set in 1947 Hollywood, it deals with down-on-his-luck, hard-boiled private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins, who does a great job, despite the fact that his British accent comes through once in a while) who is assigned by cartoon studio executive R.K. Maroon, to investigate Jessica Rabbit, the wife of one of his stars, Roger Rabbit, who is allegedly having an affair with the owner of Toontown, where all the cartoon characters (brand new and classic Disney ones) live, Marvin Acme. Valiant reluctantly accepts it because when he was younger, he and his brother Teddy, who lived to work in Toontown and help toons out, were on a case there and a toon dropped a safe on Teddy's head, killing him and leaving Eddie with a hopeless lack of sense of humor. Later, Roger is accused of murdering Marvin Acme over jealousy, and is sought by the eccentric Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd, who follows one eccentric Zemeckis role, Doc Brown, with this one), who wants to put him in his special dip which kills toons. Convinced Maroon made a patsy out of him, Eddie helps Roger prove his innocence, and in the process, it turns out that it is Judge Doom who not only killed Acme, but is also the Toon who killed his brother.Now, Roger Rabbit is none too bright, and anybody who's seen the movie can vouch for this, but he proclaims when he asks Eddie Valiant to help him that he could never hurt anybody, and that too, should be obvious to anybody who's ever seen the movie. I can remember seeing the movie when I was seven or eight in the theaters and saying, 'I never saw a cartoon talk to a person before.' Which I'm sure everybody else thought too. But I can't recommend it enough for kids or adults because kids will love the enduring, lovable Roger and adults will appreciate the marvels of the movie, which were impossible before it, as well as appreciate how much hard work went into it.There was a book before this, Who Censored Roger Rabbit, in which they were comic strips not actors, it was set in present day and Roger and Jessica's marriage was fake like Bennifer. I also hear Roger wasn't as goofy in the book, so I prefer not to read it. Plus, he dies. Now, as lovable as Roger was in the film, if they'd killed him off in that, do you know how many angry parents would have written letters to the studio that they made their children cry? I love the movie, and that might ruin it for me.",Null,2,2,12 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Best of the current trilogy so far!
","I have been a Star Wars fan since age 12 (1992), and even though I was one of the few who enjoyed Phantom Menace (except for Jar-Jar Binks, who disappointly shows up here once again), Attack of the Clones, while flawed, is much better. Non-stop action, plus a few things we've never seen in a Star Wars movie before, for example, Jedi council members Mace Windu and Yoda going to help out Obi-Wan Kenobi and getting involved with the Clone Wars. I've never been much of a stickler for the dialogue George Lucas writes, which admittedly is not that great, but what he lacks in prose, he makes up for in visualization. I mean, Yoda has a lightsaber battle in this picture for Heaven's sake! That's so original. The cute little fellow sees more action here than he has in the entire series so far!Only real problems I have with this picture are: 1. Hayden Christensen as Anakin, who seems like he's acting inthe film just because he'll get noticed and not because of whathe can contribute, which isn't a whole hell of a lot. 2. Jar-Jar Binks returns. Admittedly, it's good that if he has to be around, his appearance is kept short and sweet, but Meesa hopes Yousa Star Wars writers write in the next picture that he was lost in the Tatooine or something.",Null,0,0,20 May 2002
Armageddon," Better than critics (and viewers here) would like you to think
","What is everybody talking about? This movie, about a bunch of oil drillers sent into space to drill a hole in an asteroid and drop a nuke in it before it hits Earth, is awesome! It's entertaining as hell. It may not be very realistic, and that has been most critics' major complaint. Well, STAR WARS wasn't very realistic either, but critics, like the hypocrites they are, always sing its praises. The main reason I enjoyed it was because it would be what me and my friends'd be like if we ever went in space. They're not oil drillers, but they are, to quote Keith David in the movie, 'A buncha retards I wouldn't trust with a potato gun!'",Null,1,1,7 February 1999
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not bad. Not bad at all!
","Being that 1. James Cameron had nothing to do with this picture and 2. I knew this movie was bound to turn the Terminator series into one big continuity error (which in many ways it already was), I went into the theater today expecting a disaster. Surprisingly though, the end result is pretty good.My misgivings about a third Terminator film were, 'Didn't James Cameron and William Wisher make it abundantly clear that they resolved it by the end of the last one?' But the new Arnold model explains that the actions at the end of the movie, 'Only postponed Judgement Day. It is inevitable.' Which explains it. The writing and directing on this film is not as solid as both of its' predecessors were, but they're not bad either. Only problem with Jonathan Mostow as a director was, if Ang Lee had taken this instead of The Hulk, he could have given it the darker Cameron-esque feel to it that it lacks with Mostow. But it is well-done with him.People don't generally watch movies like the Terminator series for its' Oscar winning acting (and if they do, it's time to get off the reefer), but most of it is pretty good. The T-X is the most interesting Terminator villain, primarily because she is played by Kristanna Loken, whom I'm going to keep an eye on from now one because she's one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen. Nick Stahl, as John Connor, is a little less successful than Edward Furlong, but he's not bad. Only real disappointment was Claire Danes, because I just don't see her as John Connor's girlfriend.I'm not going to point out the continuity errors on this, no spoilers, just errors pointed out:1. When the Terminator, John and Kate come across Sarah Connor's 'grave' it is marked: 1959-1997. In the Terminator, which is clearly and distinctly set in 1984, Sarah is nineteen. So she would have been born in 1955, not 1959. 2. This movie is set in 2003, but John Connor is said to be twenty-two. In T2, which was set in 1994, he was supposed to be ten, not thirteen, as said in this movie. Although to be fair, the actor playing young John was 13 at the time.A few nitpicks, but nothing major. Good day.",Null,0,0,3 July 2003
