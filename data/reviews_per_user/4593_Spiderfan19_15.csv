The Avengers," Assemble
","One of the greatest films of the century. It still surprises me how Joss Whedon managed to give every hero something to do, which is something I kinda feel Infinity War didn't do as well, but what do you expect from a movie that crammed over 30 main characters and still make what is, in my opinion, the greatest movie of all time. This movie is a prime example of a movie that gets better as it goes along. The Battle Of New York is arguably one of the greatest action sequences in film history. This also has the added bonus of being the first MCU movie I ever saw back in early 2014. All in all, this was the film that really sparked the MCU to its full potential.",10,0,0,4 March 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Boring
","This movie is just meh, I mean, it was just sooo boring. I fell asleep somewhere near the middle for a couple minutes, and almost did again a little while later. The acting is sub-par, with the best being Tim Roth as Abomination. I can barely remember what happened throughout, and this was written a couple minutes after I finished the movie, that's how bored I was with it.",8,1,3,19 February 2019
Iron Man 3," Underrated
","This film is extremely underrated in my opinion. I enjoy watching Tony grow throughout these movies, and his arc through the trilogy is very well done. You can definitely tell that he's changed from being an obnoxious jerk to nearly sacrificing his life in The Avengers. I really didn't mind the Mandarin twist, I get why people are mad, but if you watch the 'All Hail The King' One-Shot, you know that the real Mandarin is still out there. Most of the action is very well done, with my personal favorite being Tony's escape. All in all, a very underrated MCU movie, I really recommend it if you haven't seen it.",9,2,2,10 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Extremely enjoyable
","I wasn't super excited to rewatch this one, but I really enjoyed it. The cast was great as always, and the CGI was also incredible. I can agree with some complaints, such as the villain. But on an enjoyment scale alone, not including quality or any other factors, just how much I enjoyed watching it, I think I liked this one better than the first. Quality-wise though, this is definitely one of the weaker installments in the MCU.",7,0,0,19 February 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," More spy movie than superhero movie
","One of the greatest comic book movies of all time. I love everything about it, from the action to just the basic story, it's all great. I think this was really the film that launched the modern MCU with the way it was written. I honestly think that the MCU wouldn't be what it is today without the Russo Brothers. They have directed 3 of my favorite MCU movies, including my favorite movie of all time. All in all, an amazing spy movie with some superhero elements within.",10,0,4,14 March 2019
Doctor Strange," Better after every rewatch
","This is one film that gets better every time I rewatch it. It is absolutely incredible. The CGI is probably some of, if not, the best I've seen in a Marvel movie. The acting is also great, with Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, and Benedict Wong as Wong. I feel like this film takes a while to get going, and then it pulls you in until the end. I feel like the second half went by quickly, and I wouldn't mind if this were a bit longer. All in all, a movie that just gets better and better.",8,1,1,24 March 2019
Ant-Man," A smaller film in the MCU
","This has to be one of the funniest entries in the MCU, Paul Rudd was born to play Ant-Man. I especially love the comedy and how it uses it to tell the story. Yellowjacket though wasn't that interesting of a villain. He wasn't well developed and kind of boring, but the movie was an origin story for Ant-Man, so he served his purpose. All in all, an excellent origin film for a great character.",8,0,1,18 March 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Underwhelming in the end
","Another pretty good installment in the MCU. Captain America is probably one of the greatest characters in these films, and to see his beginnings was great. I think that the first half of the film is great with the way they paced the film, and how they did some of the action. This movie falters in the second half though. They go through multiple years through pretty much a 1-2 minute montage, which leads to an underwhelming third act. Overall, pretty good through the first half, but the second half is where it falls flat.",10,1,1,2 March 2019
Captain America: Civil War," More like an Avengers movie
","Another great film by the Russo Brothers. They did such an amazing job with this one, that I don't know where to begin. Let's start with the story, compared to the comics, this is a lot different. I kind of feel like the storyline was wasted in the film. There were no consequences to their actions, which makes it seem anticlimactic. But, this film is still one of the best entries in the MCU. I love the introductions to Black Panther and Spider-Man. They were some of the best parts of the film. The action is another great thing about this movie. All in all, an amazing movie, but the premise was kinda wasted.",10,0,0,24 March 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Truly amazing
","An absolutely amazing film, James Gunn created something truly amazing. First off, I'm amazed at how he managed to introduce five new heroes and make us care about them all (DC, take notes). Honestly, this is what Suicide Squad should have been, and I'm hoping James Gunn does what he did with this for his Suicide Squad reboot. On the other side though, some of the humor didn't hit as hard as it used to. That's one thing I think Guardians 2 did a bit better. All in all though, this is one of the most creative and interesting comic book movies I've seen.",10,0,0,16 March 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Shockingly great
","This is another underrated Marvel movie, among the likes of Iron Man 3 and Thor. I think that this is one of the most enjoyable movies in the MCU. The acting is, like always, extremely great. Ultron was an okay villain for a film that focuses a lot more on the heroes and the way they have evolved through these movies. This has some of my favorite moments in the MCU, such as the Hulk Vs Hulkbuster scene. The comedy was also great, such as the 'language' jokes throughout. All in all, a great installment in a great franchise.",7,3,4,16 March 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Gotten a bit old
","This movie has kind of gotten a bit old, probably due to the fact I watched it a bunch back when it came out. I still enjoy it, just not as much as I used to. There were plenty of great moments throughout that made me still enjoy this, as well as some of the jokes. Ego was a pretty good villain as well, with Kurt Russel doing great in the role. All in all, a great movie that I think I've watched a bit too much.",8,0,1,1 April 2019
Thor," Spectacular
","Wow, this one absolutely blew me away. I can remember thinking that this was just an okay MCU movie, but now it's one of my favorites. This is a film that gets better as it goes on. The first half is a bit weak at some parts, such as the jarring transition to Earth. The rest, though, is great. The scene where Thor gets Mjolnir back is probably one of my favorite scenes from Phase 1.",8,1,1,24 February 2019
Iron Man," The one that started it all...
","Great movie to start the MCU off on. I really enjoyed most aspects of the film, such as Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. I feel that the movie drags on in certain areas, just like all of the other early MCU films, but it's not as slow as, say, The Incredible Hulk. Some of the references also feel somewhat outdated, but those don't really bother me. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable movie with some great moments sprinkled throughout.",10,0,0,19 February 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Mediocre
","Let's be honest, I dreaded watching this one. It is one of the worst MCU movies in my opinion. The story is meh, the villain is terrible, and the character development is not noticeable outside of Loki. Speaking of Loki, he was definitely the best thing about this movie, but the fact they faked his death is somewhat annoying. I personally think that was where he should have died, it would have fulfilled his character arc throughout the movies, and would have been a satisfying ending to the character. There were some great moments, but the rest of the film wasn't as good. All in all, a pretty mediocre movie with a terrible villain.",7,0,0,12 March 2019
