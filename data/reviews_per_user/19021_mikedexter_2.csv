Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome, intense, amazing.
","This is a film that blew me away the first time I saw it, and, like the original trilogy, becomes even more appreciated every time I see it.  The Phantom Menace is more than a movie, it's the first incredible installment in the biggest saga ever told on film.",10,0,0,11 July 1999
The Last Samurai," Thoroughly over-rated
","LAST SAMURAI is not the sweeping East meets West epic it aspires to be. By the end, it amounts to little more than a vanity project for Tom Cruise. At first, the story seems to be setting Cruise up for his own personal Lawrence of Arabia, but as soon as his character arrives in as a captive of the Samurais' village, the almighty Hollywood Clich√© takes over the story. You've seen this story a hundred times before, in better films... the fish-out-of-water beginnings, followed by the inevitable reluctant-mutual-respect, and eventually, the rebellious partnership. I don't understand all the praise that has been heaped upon this dull, formulaic action film. Perhaps it's American affinity for Asian culture. If you look past those cool sword fights, you'll find a movie that you've already seen a hundred times.",2,5,13,5 January 2005
