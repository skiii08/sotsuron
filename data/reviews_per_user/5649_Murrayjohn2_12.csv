Alien 3," A bit of a let down
","Alien 3 is a bit of a let down after the first two,but topping them could be impossible. That said,director David Fincher does well with the atmospherics and there are some scares,but something seems lacking. However ,there are pluses.The special effects and Elliot Goldenthal's score are good. Sigourney Weaver is excellent as always,and the film also boasts a terrific perfomance by Charles Dutton as the religious convict Dillon.7 out of 10!",Null,5,8,3 June 2002
Alien: Resurrection," Sheeeee's baaaaaaaccckkkk!!!
","Alien Resurrection is a worthy sequel. Ripley was dead at the end of the last one,right?Wrong!Thanks to the miracle of cloning,sheeeeee's baaaaaaaccccckkkk!!!Sigourney Weaver is great of  course,giving Ripley a nice edge as she is part Alien!Winona Ryder is OK.I thought Michael Wincott,Ron Perlman and Brad Dourif were good. Look for a pre-CSI Gary Dourdan as Christie,and Dan Hedaya deserves an award for the hairiest back in the universe!Good scares and effects.8  out of 10!",Null,1,1,3 June 2002
X-Men," An utterly X-Cellent movie!
","X-Men is an utterly X-Cellent movie!I've been an X-Men fan for more than 25 years and when I heard they were making this movie,I had my doubts.Say goodbye to doubts and hello to one helluva movie.I always thought Patrock Stewart was the ONLY actor to play Professor X and he does an excellent job bringing him to life.The casting was literally flawless.Special notice goes to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.I was concerned about this unknown from Australia playing one of my all time favorite characters but he totally blew me away! He IS Wolverine!Anna Paquin is superb as Rogue,showing lots of the talent that bagged her an Oscar.Famke Janssen and Halle Berry as Jean Grey and Storm?Whoa baby,I love sexy babes who can act good.James Marsden is good as Cyclops,too.Kick-ass potrayals on the villain side too:Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,who makes blue look both cool and incredibly hot as Mystique;Ray Park as the ever mobile Toad;Tyler Mane as the hulking Sabertooth;and especially Ian Mckellen ,who is a perfect Magneto.Bryan Singer directs with flash and panache,the fx are great,and Michael Kamen's score is awesome. 10 out od 10!! I want to see Spider-Man when it hits video and can't wait for X2 to hit theaters next May!! As Stan says,Excelsior!!",Null,0,0,4 September 2002
Alien," One of the scariest movies ever made
","Alien is an all-time classic.It's a haunted house story in outer space with the screens most terrifying monster. From the moment the thing bursts out of John Hurt's chest you know you're in for it!Twenty-three years on,this is still one of the scariest movies ever made. 10 out of 10!",Null,0,1,3 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A dream come true!
","Lord Of The Rings:The Fellowship Of The Ring is a dream come true.Peter Jackson has achieved something truly extroardinary:making Tolkien's marvelous characters come to life on the big screen.The love of the filmmakers for their project is apparent in every frame.The casting was phenomenal. All were excellent,with special mention going to Elijah Wood,Ian McKellen(a perfect Gandalf!),Viggo Mortensen,Sean Astin,Orlando Bloom,John Rhys Davies and Ian Holm.Ian Mckellen and Peter Jackson should have won Oscars.I'm glad Howard Shore did for his magnificent music.If there's any justice,Jackson will take a Best Director statuette for one of the remaining two films.He deserves it for having the guts to bring the beloved trilogy to the live action big screen. I can't wait till December for The Two Towers.Oh well,I'll get the Fellowship video to keep me occupied till then! 10 out of 10!",Null,0,0,5 August 2002
Aliens," Ripley kicks alien ass!
","rare is the sequel that matches or exceeds its predecessor,but Aliens does it!Ripley(Sigourney Weaver) and a squad of high tech space Marines take on a planetload of aliens.The result is plenty of chills and scares,and rip roaring action that doesn't let up for 2 and a half hours!Weaver richly earns her oscar nomination,and she's ably supported by Michael Biehn as the tough Corporal Hicks,Lance Henriksen as the good android Bishop,Bill Paxton as the neurotic Hudson,Jennette Goldstein as the kick ass female marine Vasquez and a pre-Mad About You Paol Reiser as company sleaze Burke.This movie also has one of my all time favorite lines,'Get away from her,you BITCH!!' 10 out of 10!",Null,0,0,3 June 2002
Schindler's List," One of the best movies I've ever seen!
","Schindler's List is one of the best movies I've ever seen!I'd been given the video by a friend,but never watched in until I was home sick from work one day.Watching this movie was an extroadinary experience.Stephen Spielberg achieved his greatest triumph with this masterpiece.Liam Neeson is excellent as Schindler.Ben Kingsley,Ralph Fiennes and Embeth Davidtz also turn in phenomenal performances.The black and white cinematography is superb,and John Williams contributes a masterful score.10 out of 10!",10,10,17,23 October 2002
Titanic," Why does everyone hate this wonderful movie so?
","Why does everyone hate this wonderful movie so?For it to make over a billion dollars,lots of people had to see it,then they turn around and say it's shit?I don't understand it.I didn't care for Leonardo DiCaprio before I saw Titanic,but I came away convinced that he's a pretty good actor after all.James Cameron did a fantastic job and deserves his directing Oscar.James Horner's score was magnificent and the beautiful song beautifully sung by today'premier vocalist ,Celine Dion.Now, a lot of people dumped on Kate Winslet. Not because of her acting chops,most agreed she gave  a terrific performance.They kept referring to her as fat.Kate is a wonderfully voluptuous,curvy and,yes,sexy woman.I guess if you're not a chicken-legged anorexic stick firgure like Calista Flockhart,you're not a beautiful woman these days.I'd rather see Kate naked than Calista any day of the week. I got p***ed a Joan Rivers because she said similar things on Oscar night.I guess Joan has a complex because Kate's bust is so much bigger than hers?Anyway, a few words about another performenr,Gloria Stuart.She gave a truly marvelous performancee,especially after being retired so long.MINOR SPOILER-Her speech about the fifteen hundred who went into the water and the 705 in the boats waiting for an absolution that would never come is one of the single best secnes I've EVER seen in a movie.Period.Kudos to the other cast members as well,especially Billy Zane and Kathy Bates. 10 out of 10!!",Null,1,4,15 July 2002
The Green Mile," One of the best movies I
","The Green Mile is one of the best mov ies I've ever seen.It is well directed by Frank Darabont and well adapted from Stephen King's book.The photography is excellent as is Thomas Newman's score.Tom Hanks is excellent.The real breakout is Michael Clarke Duncan. He should have got the oscar,he's THAT good!The rest of the cast is also excellent:David Morse,Bonnie Hunt,James Cromwell,Patricia Clarkson,Michael Jeter,Graham Greene,Jeffrey DeMunn,Barry Pepper,Sam Rockwell,Harry Dean Stanton and Mr Jingles. 10 0ut of 10!!",Null,1,2,7 July 2002
Jaws," An all time classic that still delivers
","Jaws is an all time classic that still delivers!I was just 11 when my Dad took my sister and me to see this at the old Middletown Drive-In.Sadly,the drive in is no more,but Jaws still exists to terrify us!From John Williams score to Spielberg's direction to the performances,all excellent.Roy Scheider as the Everyman-sheriff turned reluctant hero.Robert Shaw as the blustery fisherman who becomes almost as much a menace as the shark itself and Richard Dreyfuss as the eager icthyologist. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD-Memorable scenes and lines:Hooper telling the mayor(Murray Hamilton)'You'll ignore this problem till it swims up and bites you on the ass!';Hooper cutting open the tiger shark and pulling out a license plate;Brody telling Quint,'We're going to need a bigger boat';the riveting Indianpolis story scene,and on and on. 10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,11 July 2002
Carrie," A true classic of the horror genre.
","Carrie is a true classic of the horror genre.Let me qualify this review by stating that I am a dedicated Stephen King fan and have been so for more than 20 years.The film adaptations of his books have not always turned out well.Some,in fact,totally suck.This Brian DePalma film,the first King adaptation,is one of the best and still holds its impact 26 years after release.DePalma's direction is flawless,he has never been this good again.The cast was full of stars-to-be and older character actors:John Travolta(nice debut),Nancy Allen(the future Mrs DePalma),Amy Irving,William(Greatest American Hero)Katt,Betty Buckley,Stefan Gierasch,Sydney Lassick(Cuckoo's Nest),and Priscilla Pointer.By far ,however,the standouts were Sissy Spacek as Carrie and Piper Laurie as Margaret White.Too much cannot be said about these two actresses,who richly deserved their Oscar nominations and probably should have won.10 out of 10!",10,1,1,3 November 2002
Braveheart," A stupendous epic!
","Braveheart is a stupendous epic!From Mel Gibson's triple threat standout performance as actor ,producer AND director,to the splendid acting of the rest of the cast,to the screenplay and the score,all excellent.Add some of the best,most harrowing battle scenes ever and you have a perfect 10 out of 10!Frrreeeedommmm!!!",10,0,2,20 September 2002
