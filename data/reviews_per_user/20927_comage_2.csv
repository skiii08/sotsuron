The Incredible Hulk," A typical comic-book superhero film. Only the most die-hard Hulk fans will find this film good...
","Another typical comic book superhero movie with the usual omgwtfbbq plot twist as its ending. Putting the CGI special effects aside, this film does not warrant a high rating as a cinematic masterpiece, mainly because of the various scenes that proved...(read more) to be haphazardly stitched together for i) plot and, ii) comic relief.Plot: The opening credits scene of 2 minutes and 55 seconds undoubtedly served as a quick start for non-Hulk fans to understand the history of the Hulk. This quick start had plenty of room for improvement, as it can be seen as the simplest way out (no dialog, just cut scenes and panning shots of newspaper clips and computer screens).Comic relief: Multiple scenes which serve no purpose in moving the plot forward, but are meant to inject comic relief, but which still fail terribly in the latter are also present in this film. Scenes including a) cellular biologist Dr. Elizabeth Ross (Liv Tyler) not knowing that her lip gloss and watch cannot be tracked by the US Army, b) taxi scene where Elizabeth Ross shouts at the driver for driving too fast, and c) Banner falling from the helicopter realizes that he hasn't yet transformed into the Hulk, exclaims 'Oh sh*t!', and still ends up making a big hole in the ground with a last-minute transformation.",5,1,4,15 October 2008
Into the Wild," Silly, Foolish, and Absolutely Exasperating
","Watched this film without any expectations; realised halfway through that it was based on a true story of a man who tried to set out 'into the wild' to get away from society etc etc... and trying to 'live off the land'.Not sure how this film got to have half a million ratings that lands it with an average of 8.1 stars - this film certain did not work out all that good for me.While there is no doubt some form of sympathy evoked for McCandless - the things he did after leaving college were sorely stupid, silly, foolish and downright exasperating to watch on film.Emile Hirsch's performance was OK in this film - can't say he had a lot of room for development as an actor for such a guy who did such foolish things in real life.The only thing I felt good after watching this film, was when the end credits rolled.
Yes, this is a harsh review, but the 148 mins watching this film was time taken away from my life on witnessing the shenanigans of a foolish person doing stupid things in real-life, which eventually led to his own demise.",4,0,0,5 May 2020
