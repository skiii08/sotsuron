The King's Speech," Amazing movie!
","This is an amazingly well done movie. When my mom first suggested seeing it, I thought 'how is a movie about a guy with a stutter not going to be boring?' They did it very well. You would think that he would be talking like Elmer Fudd from Looney Toons, but he didn't. Colin Firth's stammer made it obvious to me that it was a serious problem that he struggled with on a few levels. It did not make me laugh at him, but instead I felt sorry for him. The only part where Bertie was made fun of was by his brother. But instead of laughing along with him, it made you mad at him for being so cruel to Bertie.They also did a good job of getting across the class structure that still exists in this modern age where the king has no real power. They did by showing the difficulty for those on top to budge from their feeling of superiority even though they really weren't. They also showed that royalty are also normal people with families that they care deeply about, and are self-conscious even though they are royalty.I highly recommend this movie!",10,13,24,5 January 2011
