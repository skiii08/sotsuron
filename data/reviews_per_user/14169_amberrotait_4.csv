Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049
","I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 due to the amazing imagery and music, however, the atmosphere and story was very disappointing. I feel as though I'm the only person who thinks this movie was extremely boring...there is no reason why this movie needed to be 3 hours long, and the only reason it is, is because the movie feels like it is purposely slow to create some sort of atmosphere that I just didn't feel like existed or maybe didn't feel any sort of connection to. The movements of the characters are slow, the dialogue is slow and I feel like it is intentional to add some sort of atmospheric feel, however it feels so forced that I felt like I was going to fall asleep. And I normally don't fall asleep in movies. Perhaps I'm the only one who feels this way however, I do want to give credit to the imagery and music which I felt like was the only reason I kept watching it. Definitely recommend seeing in the theatre, as if you're watching at home, you might fall asleep.",8,0,6,10 October 2017
Hereditary," Am I possessed now too?
","This is one of the first horror movies I've watched that has left me completely disturbed. There are so many insanely disturbing things that happen in this movie that I don't know where to begin. I left this movie completely convinced that after watching, that I must somehow be possessed now, that's how terrifying it is. Peter is an adorable teenager who has clearly been born into the wrong family. Charlie is an adorably disturbed child who you later realize was a demon from hell? Anyways I very much caution anyone thinking to watch this movie to make sure that they say their prayers after and carry around their sage or crystals or whatever people carry with themselves to ward off evil because this movie may shake you to your core. What a beautifully written and sometimes funny story completely twisted around into darkness. Absolutely brilliant.",10,2,7,11 July 2018
The Conjuring," Original story seemed scarier than the movie.
","I went to go see this movie with the intention of seeing 'the scariest movie of the century' as someone else had put it, but was finding myself laughing more at the movie then anything. I enjoy a good scary movie, but I can still make out the directors sense of humor every time I watch his movies. He enjoys toying with the audience, which is why his 'evil characters' are always so mischievous and funny to me. His characters always have the same sort of funny makeup on, stylized in his regular fashion. I sat there more entertained and saying 'holy s***' because this movie is so ridiculous, and not really scary. As soon as the Warrens showed up, I almost felt cradled by their presence, something I didn't enjoy! I wanted to be scared longer. I think it was a little too soon for them to show up. I got bored. I watched a few things on YouTube about the family that this had originally happened to, and it seemed scarier then what happened in this movie. I would have enjoyed seeing the daughters playing with the Ouija board prior to the crazy stuff happening, because apparently that's how it all happened. I would have enjoyed seeing the ghosts do more stuff before seeing their faces too. All in all, it was a good, entertaining movie, but in my opinion I would have scared the audience more and not cradled them in the Warrens presence for so long but maybe I'm just twisted that way.",7,1,2,27 July 2013
The Matrix," the best movie ever.
","I cannot get enough of this movie. I have seen this movie more than any other movie, and I cannot get sick of it. It has everything I need to keep coming back. This movie is on a whole other level when it comes to sci-fi. It is so well done, so smart, so stylish and everything any sci-fi or computer nerd wishes would happen to them. It's anti-establishment and really feeds into how the government and corporations are trying to bring humanity down in a way that is so poetic and amazing. I love love love love love this movie! The acting is perfect, the storyline is flawless, the graphics are insane, the plot is believable, and you just want to live in their world with them. Cannot say anything bad about this movie.",10,0,0,27 July 2013
