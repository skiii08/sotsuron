Casablanca," This is the best movie ever made
","Considering the chaos that went into the production of this film, 'Casablanca' turned out to be the perfect story -- romance, intrigue, double-crossing, nobility, all perfectly cast. Many movies have these ingredients, including another favorite of mine, 'To Have and Have Not,' but none have the magic chemistry of this flick.",10,1,1,17 May 2001
