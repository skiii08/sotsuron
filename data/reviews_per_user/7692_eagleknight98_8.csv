Howl's Moving Castle," A bit less than anticipated
","I guess I will start my short review by saying that I am a huge fan of Miyazaki since the 70's that is why I rushed to watch this movie. The movie, in short, is about a girl with low self esteem and poor self image. It is also about a selfish, egoistic and pampered boy who is too indulged with his beauty sometimes. Then fate brings those two, along with a lot of marvelous characters, together in a motivating, breathtaking adventure where each and everyone learns there weakness and strength through the other. Perhaps i was a little biased with the last two lines, because that is how i hoped it would be... The story line is somewhat weak, and if you watch it once, might look purposeless. The animation was great, but less than what he has achieved in Spirited Away. The English dubbing was good, yet weak when it comes to the fire spirit and the heroin. Overall: The movie is worth watching once in the cinema. And it is definitely worth getting the DVD to add it to the Miyazaki collection and to pay attention to those minor, yet powerful, details that one can never catch from watching the movie once.",8,1,3,25 June 2005
The Prestige," What a movie!!! Just Excellent
","Oh where do i begin! I knew this is a good movie. I knew it is gonna be tricky. So i watched tentatively from the start, and i just couldn't blink or exhale. This is one good movie and definitely worth the money to watch.The story is unique, different and very interesting. Not only about magic and complicated tricks. It is also about the complex human emotions that are beautifully portrayed by a great cast. Acting form each individual was very convincing. There were few moments when camera movement was a little irritating and unstable, but all in all.. close to perfect.In short, the movie is interesting and is like nothing i have seen before. It is definitely worth watching in the cinema... may be twice. And it is definitely worth buy the DVD. I hope they will make a presentable box set for this great movie.",10,3,5,2 November 2006
Batman Begins," The Best
","Alriqht. When i first saw the teaser/trailer, i thought to myself...oh dear... another silly comic movie. I watched it last week 'cos i didn't have any thing else to do...and guess what.... i was there for a big surprise. The story, though repeated, was put into a more respectable perspective. The characters were solid. The villains were real evil.. not just a masked actor with a manic laugh ! All actors did well. Morgan freeman was a great addition to the movie cast. Mr. Bale did a pretty good job conveying the dark part of Bruce, but i wish he was a little more muscular. Katie Holmes was too baby-like...not the typical 'hot' girls of the batman comics. I really appreciate the effort taken by the director and producers to FINALLY make a magnificent comic adaptation. I hope that this is a start to a new era of mature, wise, thrilling and fun comic movies. A MUST SEE.",8,0,1,22 June 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Good, yet devastating movie!
","i went to the cinema today with a mood for action, graphics, and lots of fun. i got lots of the former.... and non of the latter. i had no idea of what is coming and i was in it for a real real shock! movie's pace was rapid and captivating. there was no abstract or words of wisdom there... may be a sentence or two to quote, but that is it. some jokes were embedded here and there.... but i just couldn't laugh. fights ended quickly.... and things moved fast, in a direction i would have never anticipated.the new director did reasonably well in maintaining emotions and attitude of most characters from part one and two. however, i really didn't like the rapid and blurry movement of the camera in action sequences. there wasn't much of choreographed fights.... and no true duels.the make up was fantastic....everyone looked exactly like the comics especially beast. the cast did well, Logan glittered, as expected, and was the spine for this movie.all in all; this movie was nice, worth watching in the cinema and the DVD is a must have. i believe that it should have been a little longer though to give more weight to the main characters in the finale.",7,0,1,27 May 2006
Big Fish," A delightful tale from a modest man's imagination
","where to begin, and where to start....This movie deals with a simple life story of a simple man with an extraordinary imagination..... an imagination that sheds a warm ray of light to our ordinary day-to-day life to make it .... colorful.... wonderful... beautiful... rejubilant ... and worth living. It also deals with a common conflict between a man and his growing son.... put together with simple, yet very meaningful, abstract to make a marvelous 2hrs movie.The director, Tim Burton. This man's mind is full of fantasy and imagination that he can accurately depict in his pictures. One will get drawn into the story, virtually, from the first minute.... till the last. The camera shots and the angels taken takes you right into the movie and makes you live the story with the actors. Not to forget the slow, but never boring, pace in Tim's pictures that gives you time to relax psychologically and absorb the story more.The cast; they all did a great job, and delivered to the standard of Tim's imagination. Their facial expressions, their tone of voice, their complexion and their accent... all fit together in harmony and synchrony beyond any other movie.The music; as perfect as the cast. It provided the movie its dream-like pace.... and bestowed upon my heart a calm rhythm.In short... a great movie, so worth watching... and definitely worth owning.",9,0,0,5 September 2005
The Da Vinci Code," A Very Entertaining Treasure Hunt
","i went to the movie with an open mind... ready to enjoy a movie... definitely not through the religious aspect... but rather through the brain teaser angle.... i was mainly worried about skipping important parts of the novel to make a 2hours plus movie.... but it was all well done...ron haward did a great job depicting the excitement, and the action. not much of fast... and always annoying, camera movements. there were many parts were camera rotations really reminded me of beautiful mind...especially when solving a puzzle... nevertheless, they were very appropriate... and probably unavoidable.tom hanks and everyone else did a great job embodying the novel characters.it did feel a bit lengthy 20 min before the end.. for 5 minutes or so... other than that... the movie is all action and racing..all in all.... it is a movie worth watching in the cinema... once though... and there aren't many graphics and very-special effects... so some can wait for the DVD.. if they can!! and it is definitely worth owning the DVD...finally... it is so unfortunate that there are ones who gave a rating of 1... i am sure they didn't watch the movie... at least not with their mind open!! and i was so tempted to give the movie 10 to bring up the level.... but i'd still keep it fair.",8,3,6,26 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," What is the hype for?!!
","I watched the movie with great expectations. It was given good reviews by many people and is still one of the top ten in the box office. What for??? First of all, if you watch the trailer... you have already learned the whole story and seen the most exciting parts of the movie! Then there comes approx. 120 min of the same thing over and over. Acting wise... well i have to say both did a good job, but nothing new... i mean, from Angelina perspective, it was like watching Tomb Raiders III!!! Having said that, the movie had some rare fun moments, and a lot of exaggerated action. Perhapse if the movie was made with different cast, no one would've bothered to watch it. Overall, this movie is worth watching on DVD on a very-boring Friday night.",4,8,16,26 June 2005
Ran," Not The Best
","Needless to say that the mere fact that this movie is directed by Kurasawa gives this movie five stars. Yet, I was really hoping for an intelligent twist in this story.... a great battle tactics, unfortunately that wasn't the case. The story simply deals with a tyrant dictator who raged war against many people, perhaps some were innocent,and now it is his time to pay back. The acting is good.... yet less impressive that other Kurasawa movies. I just couldn't love, hate or admire any of the characters. The camera tells the story in a beautiful way but sometimes it is just too far away to tell who is who.... one can only know by the color code if the banner! The battle scenes were magnificent, and even though too short lived, were the most interesting part of the movie. Overall, It is still worth the 2hrs and 40 min. Yet this movie doesn't stand out as the old ones did.",7,2,6,7 July 2005
