Scarface," Overrated - slow and boring
","I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out 20 years ago, and saw it again last night on tv (I've seen all or parts of it at other times as well).  My opinion remains the same - slow and boring.  You wouldn't think it could be with all the violence and swearing, but it is.  Maybe it's because of all the violence and obscenity that it becomes boring.  I got anesthetized to the shock value of them.  Plus, the plot just wasn't anything special.  Admittedly, there were good performances by Pacino, Pfeiffer, and others, but the film as a whole doesn't even come close to comparing with other crime classics such as The Godfather I and III or Goodfellas, among others.  It didn't get great reviews when it came out, but it has achieved an almost cult status over the years that I just don't understand.  Much of this has to do, I suspect, with some admittedly lasting catch phrases, e.g., 'Say 'ello to my l'il friend.'  These lines alone, however, in my opinion, do not a good movie make.  DePalma has certainly done better with many of his other movies, including Carrie, Body Double, and The Untouchables.",Null,0,2,23 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Probably the 'worst' of the original three
","While this was a good movie, I just don't understand how some people can claim that this is the best of the original trilogy.  I would rate Star Wars and Return of the Jedi above it.  As I recall, that was also the general consensus soon after they were first released.  At the time, people generally thought Empire was good, but were a little disappointed.  When Jedi came out, it seemed as though people were much more satisfied, similar to the early reviews of Episode II (favorable) compared to Episode I (not up to expectations).",Null,0,0,13 May 2002
