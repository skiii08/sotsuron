Your Name.," Amazing
","I just saw this so a little later than all the hype. Just stumbled upon this while looking for a decent movie and heard good things about it. Wasn't expecting much and the first few minutes seemed unimpressive at first. Glad I found this movie. It has a really solid storyline, great art, and such a great interesting concept. I'll never forget this movie and it is easily one of my favorite movies now. Highly recommend seeing this stunning twist of a love story.",10,0,0,16 April 2020
Toy Story 4," I Loved It
","I see a lot of people didn't like this one and I can understand their reasons but it was a nice close to Woodys storyline after being Andy's favorite and now not really being needed by Bonnie. It was a good watch really enjoyed it and felt it was a good close to the series. It didn't have much screen time for the other characters though which I didn't mind just maybe buzz, but overall liked the new characters and the story telling that Pixar always does.",10,3,5,27 September 2019
Aladdin," Really Liked it
","I went in honestly thinking it was going to be bad, I loved the animated version as a kid. Came out feeling sad it was over. Loved it all and knew when certain parts came up from the animated movie, a whole new world scene the Arabian knights song. Overall thought I was very well done not to compare it too much to the animated but enjoy it for what it was.",10,2,9,27 May 2019
The Lion King," Liked It
","Read a lot of the negative reviews before going to watch it and almost didn't go. After watching it though I really enjoyed the adaptation they did of the original. I went in with an open mind knowing it's not the original and hoping just for a good movie and wasn't disappointed. They did a good job with the CGI and it was funny and they cut a lot of the singing from the original and made it, in my opinion, more realistic. Would really recommend to anyone for a nice family night.",10,1,6,20 July 2019
