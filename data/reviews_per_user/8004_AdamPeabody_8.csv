The Blair Witch Project," It hurts me to say this...
","I had the privilege of screening Blair Witch before the main release. I was pensive, anxious, apprehensive, but primarily excited. Bummer.Now, I usually dig movies that try new things, and this one did so with flying colors. It's simply a shame that I was alienated from each character due to the fact that they're just plain jerks. By the time the 'shocking ending' came about, I didn't really care if they died. (Which, everyone knows, they do.) I just wanted them to shut up. I'm also a great advocate of oblique ways of portraying the antagonist. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was just the rest of the crew yelling in the woods. So, in short, go see this innovative film. Just don't expect as much as I did.",Null,1,1,29 July 1999
Cloverfield," Great sound design...um, that's it, I guess.
","This video (yes, I meant that) may be comfortably viewed on, say, my 7' portable DVD player. Perhaps even as large as my 20' bedroom TV. Certainly not the big ol' DLP in the living room. And under no circumstances should this picture be viewed on THE SILVER SCREEN. Clearly taking a cue from any and all video footage from 9-11, this is a movie about running. Not in the 'Run Lola Run' Steadicam/Shotmaker Truck kind of way, oh no. This movie is about running in the same way as giving the video camera to your four year-old. There is more footage of the Lower Manhattan asphalt here than anything else. There was a warning printed on Salmon-colored paper at the theater where I viewed this explaining to me I might suffer motion sickness as result of seeing 'Cloverfield.' It should have said 'will suffer motion sickness.' When it ended, I swear I've never before heard more people groan wearily as they stood up.The one genuinely redeeming element of seeing 'Cloverfield' in the theater was the brilliant sound design. That is what holds everything together and makes it remotely enjoyable. While somewhat unrealistic, being that no handy-cam microphone could record (to say nothing of playing back) such rich audio, it is still very compelling and engrossing to listen to what the visuals cannot convey. There are a lot of these moments. Particularly, there is a moment in the subway tunnels when the characters are being stalked by creatures unseen, only to reveal them in an admittedly clever use of the infrared gimmick. This was a really hard video to watch. I had to take full minutes away from the screen to focus on the theater's EXIT sign in order to prevent heaving up my popcorn. Entire running sequences are lost to me as I stared at the hairdo sitting in front of me. At least in the beginning, I could watch the on-screen time and date, which held perfectly still. That ended up disappearing about fifteen minutes in. Michael Bonvillain, ASC, I salute you. You truly kicked my butt. I hope someone gets you a geared head on a J.L. Fisher dolly next Christmas.",5,2,5,22 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Let stop and think, shall we?
","Okay.I've been reading a lot of crap about this picture. I've been reading a lot of junk about how it's barely better than Episode 1, how the dialogue is muddy, and the performances are bland, and on and on and on. I work in the movies. I know how every take is different from each other, and I know how the director can have a profound influence on the movie regardless of the script.So. Let's take a moment to consider something. The performances were merely average and the dialogue sounds like someone reading the menu at McDonald's? Has anyone actually stopped and listened to Lucas speak in the last ten years? There is no more boring speaker in the world. Lucas makes Stephen Hawking sound like Sinatra. It seems almost natural to me that the chosen takes would sound like the dialogue running through Lucas' head while he was writing it.Okay. That point aside, can anybody actually sit back and take in this picture for what it was? We all entered the theater with heightened expectations. ALL of us. Was it going to be as good as Irvin Kischner's visceral 'Empire?' No. Was it going to be as slyly clever as the interpersonal dialogue between Han and Luke on the Death Star? No. Was it going to be a story about people living their lives before the crushing hand of the empire controlled the universe? YES!This movie was not about the radical feats of problem solving and improvisation during episodes 4 through 6. This was a movie about characters who have yet to realize the incredible importance they will have over the course of history. This was a movie about the human elements inside all of us, regardless of our duties and obligations. This was the movie Lucas promised us would follow in the shallow footsteps of Episode 1 and make all the difference in the course of the tale.Ultimately, what I am trying to say by this rambling diatribe is shut up, stop pretending to be filmmakers, and enjoy watching the perpetually slighted Yoda kick some Dark Side ass.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
American Psycho," Hmmm...
","As a film school graduate, I am very interested and enthusiastic about film theory and analysis of cinema. It is because of this that I am frustrated.After viewing American Psycho (and rather enjoying it), I must reluctantly admit this: I didn't get it.I implore you, readers of the IMDB. Post some insight here. I could use some assistance. It bothers me to leave a film saying to myself, 'Huh?' After all...I understood Twin Peaks.",Null,0,0,18 May 2001
U-571," Predictable? Let's talk...
","Okay. Many people who've seen U-571 have also seen Das Boot. Many of these people are also complaining that U-571 was predictable. So I pose this question: Was Das Boot predictable? Any viewer would expect the noble crew to return home to Germany safely and without loss of their ship. Right? But it didn't happen that way, did it? In comparing these two films, is it fair to argue that U-571 was really predictable during the initial viewing? I, for one, (also comparing it to Das Boot) was more or less awaiting the inevitable failure of the crew as much as their success. How can anyone really predict a movie outright?",8,0,4,22 April 2000
The Fast and the Furious," You want 'high concept?' You got it...
","Okay.I admit it.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I have a habit of entering mass-market pictures with a low, albeit cynical, expectations of what I am about to witness. In doing this, I am often pleased with the end result...'X-Men' being an example of this.'The Fast And The Furious' is an energetic romp through the adrenaline-saturated world of people who push the envelope. It is essentially 'Point Break' meets 'The Road Warrior.' As ridiculous as this sounds, it was clearly done by someone who cares about the quality of the end result.All in all, this was one of the better car movies I've seen in quite some time. I have my fingers crossed that the box office response puts Renny Harlin's latest farce, 'Driven,' to shame.",Null,0,1,24 May 2001
The Matrix," Special effects are plot-worthy.
","To begin, I genuinely enjoyed The Matrix. I am typically very cautious about mass-released sci-fi, especially starring Keanu. However, knowing the Wachowskis' work, I was excited. (Also, I know several crew members who never shut up about it.) I am very satisfied with the finished product. None of the special effects are new or revolutionary, but FINALLY they had a valid reason for being in the film. By integrating special effects with the plot, the Wachowskis brought us a solid and fully developed science-fiction movie. Go see it. Do it now.",8,0,0,9 April 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I've never voted 10 for a film. Ever.
","This is one of those remarkably few films that is both commercially successful as well as a cinematic WORK. Spielberg, who I typically have reservations about, truly outdoes himself in this film by directing Ford, and Connery in their best roles ever. Speaking from the perspective of a perpetual 007 fan, I have to give Connery his fair share here as an ACTOR. This is working in the business at its finest. Being around actors and crew members all the time, I have to appreciate what has been accomplished in this movie. Kudos to all involved...even to Ben Burtt for his foleyed rats. Only in my latest viewing did it occur to me that those aren't really rats squealing away but foley artists in a studio somewhere in Burbank. Congrats!",10,0,0,10 April 2000
