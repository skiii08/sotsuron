Requiem for a Dream," A must see tragic masterpiece
","Since the first time i watched 'Requiem for a Dream' ,i couldn't stop watching it over and over despite it is an extremely hard-to-watch film alongside A Clockwork Orange.
From the first shot until its powerful ,electric tragic end, this movie teaches you just how to look at the world and how to know about the ultimate destructive consequences of the drugs.
Jennifer Connelly here is powerful and magically beautiful ,Jared Leto is real true tragedy and so is Marlon Wayans whose known for being comedic as hell. 
The real star here is Sara which steals the show.
My favorite drama film is this one. Don't watch it alone ,surely not in the night..",10,1,1,3 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," THE WORST STAR WARS EVER MADE
","So I saw Attack of the Clones today on the 4th time. And to my cynical surprise ,I still HATE this movie.
I am a STAR WARS MEGA FAN since I'm a kid even if i wasn't born in the times. Anyways ,Attack of the Clones is boasted by completely boring dramatic and romantic sequences ,messy action sequences and too much drama.
The Phantom Menace was something new ,a really deep dramatic toned addition to the saga and I didn't liked it so much because of the boring political drama.
Anyway, Attack of the clones really shows Anakin Skywalker's first major steps into the dark side in two sequences and that's it and yeah there few action sequences and Count Dooku rocks but there are lots of odd boring drama and romance.The John Williams score is maybe the sole best thing here.",5,1,2,25 August 2018
Lawrence of Arabia," My 2nd favorite adventure film
","'Lawrence of Arabia'. Man, this movie is a tremendously powerful masterpiece. This movie caused Spielberg and many others to become filmmakers.I first saw this movie at a young age ,and despite the pacing and the extreme runtime of 3 hrs and a quarter, this movie is a magnificent celebration of stunning visuals, smart screenplay, epic music by the late Maurice Jarre, and amazing action sequences and one Lawrence, Peter O'Toole.After watching this movie for the 6th time ,i made research about the true epic story behind the film and i really list it as my 2nd favorite adventure film ever alongside the first Indiana Jones but i may think that no other adventure movie can top of this.Yes ,the running time is extremely long and too much exhausting ,yes the pace is too slow but this movie is a freaking jewel.Must see film for everyone.",10,3,5,16 August 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers: Age of Ultron
","Let's just start in that 'Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron' is truly the biggest Marvel movie sequel to date. It has lots of excellent action sequences ,battles and more ,But most of all was the titular Ultron, He is actually an evil rogue robot android and he is totally funny villain ,In his terrifying and eccentric performance ,James Spader give us what Tom Hiddleston's partly-dumb villain Loki in the previous film didn't gave us and it is fun and a real scheme. Ultron's scheme is definitely to eradicate human race and replace them with his robotic army and then to take over the Earth ,as all comic book villain does. However, Loki wanted to rule over Earth and humanity in order to become a king ,what he didn't got in the first 'Thor' in 2011. AOU also has a great cast job not only by the original Avengers from the first film ,and not only by Samuel L Jackson's SHIELD Director Nick Fury ,but also Aaron Taylor Johnson who already starred as a superhero in the two 'Kick-Ass' films ,this time ,he returns as a real superhero ,alongside the beautiful Elizabeth Olsen ,and then we have the excellent Paul Betanny who gave us voice acting for JARVIS in the three Iron Man films and in the previous film of the Avengers ,but this time ,JARVIS becomes Vision ,a powerful android created by our funny movie antagonist ,and he gives us not also worthy to the Asgardian mighty big bodied blonde Avenger's Mjolnir hammer but also shows us an android with sympathy and human features. The fantastic film music by the excellent Brian Tyler and by Danny Elfman ,who composed already two Marvel films ('Spider- Man' and 'Spider-Man 2') ,shows us what the great Alan Silvestri didn't succeeded to renew ,and the duo are doing it in so equal and epic way. For ending ,Avengers: AOU is definitely the biggest and excellent Marvel movie to date maybe more than its first proceedor ,and maybe more than the other MCU films that we saw years prior. Rating: 10/10 - It is an epic superhero movie about unity ,team work and back-to-back help when the things turn wrong.",10,2,7,12 March 2016
Avatar," The greatest sci fi film ever made of all time
","Groundbreaking visual effects , smart brilliant and thought-provoking screenplay writing, amazing storyline, tremendous heroes and characters, epic music and epic atmosphere alongside furious action sequences, Avatar by my opinion is the greatest sci fi film ever made of all time.
Yes ,greater than Blade Runner ,greater than 2001 Space Odyssey ,even Star Wars.
A masterpiece of Mr James Cameron.",10,1,2,23 September 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," PURELY TREMENDOUS MASTERPIECE
","Damn it ,this movie is just a flawless masterpiece (except for the long runtime).
From the first shot until the middle and the grandiosely epic end ,the LOTR Trilogy ends up with a huge epic war and with historical production design ,epic music and a perfect cast which acts out the most alongside brilliant story-telling and genius writing as well as hugely spectacular action sequences with full heart touching tone of drama.
Every time i watch it and survives 200 minutes ,i recall the time i saw it at the cinema alongside many LOTR fans. I'm a fan of LOTR but not too much.
Anyways ,this movie is hands down the best fantasy film of all time. It's also my most favorite fantasy movie more than any single movie of fantasy genre!.",10,0,0,5 August 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," The greatest action movie of all time ever made in human history
","I remember first watching this movie on the big screen in IMAX 3D. My eyes and my head were really hurt on that day but it was worth it.
On the 13th time watching it ,this film is truly a huge masterpiece. Everyone call other movies such as Aliens or Terminator 2 as the greatest action movies including Die Hard from 1988. I defiently agree with them but Mad Max Fury Road is the greatest action movie ever made.
From the first shot until the end ,this movie is just an incredibly powerful chase which never stops for a moment but it really has deep story and thought-provoking themes.
Tom Hardy replaced Mel Gibson but Hardy is awesome the same as Gibson ,let's not talk about the incredible Charlize Theron.
The villain made me chills and nightmares every time he was on the screen.
Powerful incredible action sequences, amazingly beautiful cinematography and visual effects and of course the talented cast.",10,0,2,13 August 2018
