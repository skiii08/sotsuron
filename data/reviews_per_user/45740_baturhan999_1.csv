3:10 to Yuma," another contestant for the worst movie of the year
","OK we (me and other western fans) assume that some one at some place try to shot a nice decent western and share it with audience. well this movie is just a (umm it might be so decent to call disappointment) CRAP. I saw the original one, not bad but fine. But this one is just a piece of crap, and I guess that Russell crow decided to test himself to qualify for the best actor in a best crappy movie ever.I ain't gonna write about the storyline , or how good or bad the actors are. I think its better to say, don't waste your precious 2 hours to watch this movie and just go watch mickey mouse cartoons.well, I just feel sorry about the money spent to this movie, and I think Hollywood is just dead",Null,2,5,25 February 2008
