Catch Me If You Can," Brilliant entertaining cinema
","Brilliant piece of cinema and wonderfully entertaining story. Many other IMDB users have already commented on the excellence of the acting, but I would like to applaud the production team - Mr. Spielberg and his DP/Editing/Music/Casting team is, I feel, the best in the business at the moment, and this movie demonstrates their mastery of the medium (and should make this movie a must see for film students).  Also, thank you to the screenwriter(s) for a sophisticated and engaging story.",Null,0,1,5 January 2003
