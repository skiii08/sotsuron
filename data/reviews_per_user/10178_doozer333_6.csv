Who Framed Roger Rabbit," 12 years later it's still cool
","This movie is absolute perfection.  Laugh if you must, but it manages to come up with a great premise, and pulls it off it flawlessly.  The special effects are still impressive today, and the campy, hammed up performances are all perfect for the over the top satire of film noir and corporate greed.  Is it the best movie ever?  Hell no.  But it does what it sets out to do and that alone is a great feat.  And any film with Micky Mouse and Bugs Bunny in the same scene deserves a hallowed place in film history.",Null,0,0,28 February 2000
X-Men," A comic book movie that is not embarrassing...
","...or homoerotic, for that matter.  Finally, a director has decided to not only make a movie based on a comic book, but also has decided to take it seriously.  Many past directors have always seemed almost embarrassed of the fact that their main character is a man that dresses like a bat or a pretty boy in blue and red spandex.  The people and stories are then treated as these campy jokes.  It's insulting to anyone who reads the comic, and to people who expect a high-flying action flick and get cheesey one liners. Brian Singer is the first director that doesn't seem embarrassed by his subject, and it helps.  I am not a 'fanboy' or at least I wasn't before the film, so I had no reason to feel betrayed by the little differences.  But even the most hard core comic fans have to admit that no one was shamed in this movie.  All the characters were treated with respect.  Some were under-used, but that is not the same thing.  There were no groaners as far as the dialog goes (with the possible exception of Storm's 'do you know what happens to toads that get struck by lighting?' line.  what was that?), and the villains didn't dance around screaming 'I'm so eeeeeeevil' a la Batman. I think the comic fans should rejoice! Plus, not for nothing, but don't you think it is a bit daunting to include 30 or so years of backstory into one movie without tweaking information or consolidating characters?  I think they did a fine job.  Just thought I'd give my two cents on a great little movie, simply cause I can.  God bless the internet.",Null,0,0,2 August 2000
MASH," Coolest War Movie Ever
","Let me just say that I hate the show.  I just never saw what all the fuss was about.  People would tell me this is because I am only 19 and have never known war.  These people are idiots.  The movie is one of the funniest and unique takes on war that I have ever seen.  If the series had an ounce of the spark and originality of this movie and cast, it may have been a million times more popular that it already is.  It is a movie about war, but really, it is about nothing at all.  The whole movie feels like it's just sort of hanging out, like we're just eavesdropping on these people for awhile. Everytime I watch it I catch another joke or gesture I may have missed. The film just grows on you.  The thing that sets it apart from other war movies, that makes it really cool, is that it never once stops to preach at you. No dramatic death scenes, no corny rationale for the lead characters awful behavior, the movie just is.  It is touching and thoughtful on it's own. If you loved the series, see this film, and if you hated the series, you need to see it even more.",Null,0,1,28 February 2000
Moulin Rouge!," The film equivalent to Pop Rocks.
","The first half of Moulin Rouge is pure genius.  I've heard several reviews that say the exact opposite, but I have to humbly disagree.  The movie starts out as a dizzying, energetic trip of a movie that somehow manages to be both a parody of musicals and a tribute to them.  I have never in my life seen a group of people have more fun on screen than the cast does here.  And the music is simply brilliant.  It's a celebration of the pop music of the past couple decades.  It's an ode to how cheesy it really all is but how much it moves us anyway.  `Elephant Love Medley' had my friend and I doubling over in fits of delighted giggling as we recognized each song as it burst onto the scene.  `Like a Virgin' rivaled the best of Monty Python's musical numbers and `Roxanne' manages to be funny, sexy and tragic all at the same time.  The club itself plays like a megamix of the past century; seamlessly blending disco with Nirvana, Marilyn with Madonna and kitschy 70's rock with Nat King Cole.  And then we get to the second half.  The songs become less frequent and the obligatory tragic ending begins its downward spiral.  The life just gets sucked right out of the film.  It suddenly feels unfocused, but not in the frenetic, hyper, joyous way of the first half, but more in the `we have to cram three hour of plot into one hour of movie' way.  This is a movie that should have the audience dancing out of the theatre, but instead it's ridiculously down ending had them staring blankly at the screen.  Even the most tragic of stage productions has a curtain call.  One last blast of music that gets the audience back into the giddy artifice of the Broadway Musical, one last audio rush that inspires the masses to give standing ovations to pieces that may not even really deserve it.  This is sorely lacking from Moulin Rouge.  The movie is the film equivalent to Pop Rocks.  It's a party in your mouth for the first couple seconds, and then your tongue gets all scratchy and you suddenly want a drink of water.  In spite of this, I highly recommend this movie.  I think pretty much everyone will enjoy at least one half of it, depending on your tastes, but the whole still must be seen to be believed.",Null,0,1,6 June 2001
Gladiator," A Classy Pop Corn Movie
","You've always got to review a movie based on what it set out to do. Gladiator set out to be a grand, summer movie, action set piece. And it did that. Masterfully. And most glorious of all, it didn't make you feel guilty for enjoying it. The plot was thin but it was solid. Everything that took place happened for a distinct reason that was in context with the time period and the characters. The characters themselves were written archetypically. Maximus is the unflawed hero, Commodus is the sniveling villain, Proximo is the scoundrel with a heart of gold etc, but the performances took all of them to another level and made you care. Russel Crowe in particular is a master of doing just that. Give that boy a clich√©, and he will beat it into submission. And he will do it sexily, which doesn't hurt. The action scenes are big and exciting but never unbelievable or embarrassing. To grade Gladiator as an extremely serious, epic film in the same mold as say, Spartacus, is a bit unfair. It is a summer action movie, but it is a smart, well done, and exciting summer action movie that thrills its audience without playing down to them.",9,0,1,29 May 2000
Princess Mononoke," I wish I spoke Japanese...
","Or at least maybe saw the subtitled version of this movie.  I can't help but think that something was lost in the translation.  I've always been a casual anime fan, feeling that as in all things, there are some great examples and some real crummy ones.  Visually, this film will knock you on your butt.  I actually made little gasping noises at some points because of the sheer beauty and inventiveness of what I was seeing on screen.  As for the actual story, I couldn't help but feel that something really important was going on behind all that nonsensical and bland dubbed dialog that I was just missing. I really couldn't tell you a thing that happened in the entire second half of the movie.  People were screaming, many things' heads were being chopped off, there was a lot of blood and a half-assed love story while everyone switched sides about nine times and then the confrontation dissolved in some sort of quasi-truce that really seemed to leave everyone right back where they started.  Oh.  And conserve the Earth everyone!  There is a possibility that I am just an idiot.  But many of the other reviews indicated that the dubbed version attempted to dumb down Japanese mythology so that we Americans can understand.  I think they should have left well enough alone because the current translation is a mess.  I am not willing to count out the film just yet.  But I think I would recommend viewing the subtitled version to those who haven't seen it yet, if it is even available.  Those are usually a little more literal in the translation.  Worth a viewing for animation fans no matter what, though.  Visually amazing stuff.",Null,0,1,29 April 2001
