Lucky Number Slevin," Grest movie of all time
",I have been a true movie buff my entire life. I have a list of movies that will always be the best of all time. This movie is one of them. I love a movie that makes me think. I love that the plot starts very confusing in the beginning then reveals itself at the end. You could not ask for a better 'all star' cast. Some of the best actors of all time in one movie? You could not ask for more. Anyone that does not understand this movie need to stick to cartoons or reality shows. There was a reason Bruce Willis spoke about 'The Kansas City Shuffel'. That what this movie is about. It will always get 10 stars from me. I have watched this movie over 20 times and will never get tired of it.,10,1,3,26 February 2011
