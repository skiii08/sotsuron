Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace is a terrific film, forwarding all the elements which won Star Wars' place in our hearts.
","I absolutely loved this movie, as did my 12 and 3 year old boys.  The creativity, the plot, the acting, the pacing: all worked wonderfully well for me.I think the movie's critics are too full of themselves.  If the movie pauses to develop something, it is 'boring'; if it sails and careens ahead with breathtaking action, it is 'shallow'; if it strikes universal themes, it is 'a kid's movie' - and so forth.  These folks need to get over themselves. Judge the movie for what Lucas sets out to accomplish, not what you think he should have accomplished.One doesn't get on a roller coaster and critique its social relevance, unless one wishes to reveal oneself as an effete snob.It's a wonderful movie.  Avoid all spoilers, and go see it!",7,0,1,25 May 1999
Madagascar," Dang! that Pixar is good!
","No, my title isn't a goof. It's just the thought this harmless but mostly uninspired little movie provoked.Pixar has an ability to wrap up a relatively involved plot, very involving characters, and something for every age-level.Madagascar is -- well, it's mostly inoffensive, mildly amusing, passably entertaining... and otherwise nothing to crow about. I took my 5 and 9 year old sons, and they enjoyed and laughed. I chuckled once or twice, sat patiently, and kept thinking about how great Pixar is.The characters are shruggable, the plot is very lightweight, and the overall effect fine for a kids' movie. The penguins more or less steal the show, followed by the lemurs and the monkeys. Problem is, they aren't the stars. The stars are OK, and that's about it. (With any luck, Chris Rock won't be voicing any more kids' movies.) Do I recommend it? Sure, for your kids. But unless you want to go just to financially support a largely unobjectionable feature movie, you won't lose anything by waiting for the DVD.Put another way, it's just like The Incredibles, or Toy Story I or II -- only without the plot, the main characters, the humor, the wisdom, or the trans-generational valuable subtexts.",7,0,1,31 May 2005
The Irishman," Don't feel guilty for admitting it isn't good
","I think we're all obliged to say we like it because it's from Scorsese and has all these 'legendary' actors. But it isn't good. I imagine it went something like this:Pitch-man: Got a great idea for a movie.
Money-man: Tell me.
PM: Scorsese will direct.
MM: Wow.
PM: Yeah, but that's not all. It'll have De Niro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel, Romano...
MM: Yow, those are big names. Those guys are great. Or, were great.
PM: Well, yeah! And Anna Paquin, too.
MM: Oh good, for the kids.
PM: Yeah.
MM: One problem. How do we afford all those big names?
PM: Got that covered, and it's genius.
MM: Do tell.
PM: No script writers!
MM: Whaat?
PM: Naw, we'll put in names for writers. But really, we just give the actors an idea what the scene's about and, and we let 'em go! Just let 'em go!
MM: Ah...
PM: Naw, you kiddin'? It'll be great! They're great actors! They're legends!
MM: Well, maybe, but... you ever heard actors talk? Without a writer? Actually talk? It's, it's not pretty. You don't want that.
MM: Trust me, it'll be great.And that's just what it sounds like. About 45 minutes of plot crammed into 209 bloated, indulgent minutes. Amazingly bad dialogue, if you even want to call it that. An as others have remarked, older people acting and moving like older people with somewhat youthened faces...not an appealing effect.So I'm not with the pack on this one. Not recommended.",3,6,14,6 December 2019
Southpaw," Hard to like a movie with such an obnoxious main character
","I like boxing movies. I'm almost a sucker for them. Cinderella Man, Rocky 3, Creed, and on and on. I do like the hardworking underdog/redemption story theme, and a well-choreographed match.And these fight sequences are okay, plus Gyllenhaal clearly got in shape for them.BUT he SO overacts, and the character is SO obnoxious, that it just isn't that fun to watch.Whether scripted or not, you feel like Gyllenhaal is ad-libbing a constant patter of nonsense babble in many scenes. We're supposed to care a lot that he loses his great wife, and his daughter is taken away from him. But BOTH happen because HE DOES NOT LISTEN, and he never really confronts that killing flaw.Even in the courtroom scene, when the judge is informing him what's going to happen, Gyllenhaal (I can't feel it's the character) is mugging and clowning and yapping at his daughter across the room, clearly not taking the trial or the judge seriously -- and so, predictably, when the sentence is finished, he says 'What?' Yeah, Enstein: what she said while you were acting like a dimwitted toddler.What arc there is feels jerky and lacks credibility. He's an idiot, he's an idiot, he's an idiot...oh, okay, now he's really going to train for this fight. Well, great, so I guess everything's all fixed now. And if he can beat that other fighter, he'll be a fit father. Great.It left me more irritated than entertained, and not in any good way.I gave it a 5 because the fight sequences are decent, and the little girl who plays the daughter (Oona Laurence) is one of the more consistent, empathy-provoking characters.",5,0,0,24 May 2017
Pitch Black," Good establishment of mood, effective shocks, involving (though not deep) plot
","I approached this film with uncertainty, having heard good and bad about it. But I kept thinking, as I watched it, 'This is a good flick!'By 'good' I don't mean meaningful, terribly thought-provoking, or uplifting. By 'good' I mean cleverly crafted, well-executed, entertaining, and involving.The violence is pretty intense, the language is rough, and 'God' (this time from a Muslim perspective) gets an obligatory Hollywood slam.  In the plus column, I loved a dozen subtle directorial touches.  When you see it, you'll know what I mean when I say 'tap-tap-tap' and 'Don't you dare,' plus another dozen or so quick and interesting visual cuts.All in all it's a diverting tale and a good flick, if you can handle dark science fiction.  (I think I saw the word 'erotic' or 'sexy' or some such applied to it somewhere, and must confess I've no idea why.  That element is completely absent.)",8,0,0,14 October 2000
Van Helsing," You want fun? It's fun
","I think it fairest to watch a movie more in terms of what it means to be, than in terms of what I think it should be.  (For an example of how wrong you can go by violating this, see Roger Ebert's review of The Fellowship of the Ring, which should have been titled 'How I Would Have Shot the Book' [and thank God he didn't].)But I digress.Stephen Sommers wanted to ramp up the action, the looks, the story, and the plain old zing-bang-pow.  In that, he succeeded admirably.  The action sequences are fast and fun, the movie's got bags of eye-candy, the actors do just what they're supposed to do.You want creepy?  See Alien again.  You want atmosphere?  See Mimic, or Sixth Sense, or Halloween.But if you want a sort of Indiana Jones Digs Up Three Cool Monsters... well, here you go.Yes, I wish it had had some more humor.  (See Hellboy.)  I could have lived, happily, without the friar's hypocrisy.  And the makeup on Igor was so incongruous, so 70's-throwback, that I thought it would end up as a plot-point.  It didn't; just incongruously bad makeup.But my oldest son and I had a great time... and that's generally why we go to movies!",7,0,0,8 May 2004
Being John Malkovich," Neat premise, disappointing execution
","This is the first time in a good while that I've thought repeatedly of bailing out on a movie - and that with a movie I'd wanted to see for some time.I found the premise promising from the start.  I like John Malkovich as an actor, and it sounded like a creative, fun way to go.  I looked for a fun, imaginative time.The Creative Forces, however, thought otherwise.  [Possible SPOILERS ahead.] They thought this would be a great time to create unlikable, amoral, vicious, clueless characters and have them carry the movie.  They thought themes of adultery, new forms of sexual perversion (just what we needed!), and constant sexual banter would be daring and risky and great cocktail-party fodder.Well, maybe it was for them, but it isn't for me.  I've never thought adultery was funny or interesting, and odds are excellent that I never will. And that was a central theme: married man pursues vicious, despicable woman... only to be joined in the pursuit by his wife.  Ho ho ho, how cutting-edge.  Yawn.I'm thinking my '5' was overgenerous, as I write.  I do not recommend the film.  A clever idea was poured through a filthy sieve. Pity.",5,0,1,6 July 2002
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Surprisingly boring and obnoxious
","It felt like the creators (?) literally said to each other, 'This is the Harry Potter world! People love this stuff! Let's just make sequences that go on and on and on. They'll eat it up! They won't care whether the participants do things that make sense or seem to have a single pair of functioning neurons between them!' The particular failure is in the main character. Most of the time, Eddie Redmayne does one of two things: affects an obnoxiously clueless, staring leer as he passively watches events unfold around him; or listlessly chasing after creatures he can't possibly capture by hand, having somehow forgotten that he has wizardly ways of obtaining them without provoking them to destroy everything within a half-mile.Even the music was uninspired; but against the memory of John Williams, what isn't? Oh, there were good effects, and eye-candy sequences, and a few isolated moments of interesting characters. But the whole was far, far less than the sum of the parts.Just disappointing.",5,1,3,7 May 2017
Quantum of Solace," Disappointing ( they couldn't afford a decent cinematographer and script?)
","Mainly I saw Q of S because I'd enjoyed the last movie, and Craig was a very good Bond - probably next-best behind (duh) Connery.Aigh. Don't bother.For starters, the cinematography was TERRIBLE. Were I the stunt coordinator, I'd be *ticked*. What's the point in choreographing great sequences, if nobody can understand them? It would be like creating a beautiful painting, then having the idiot curator display it in a dark corner behind a ladder.To wit: Great action scenes (I guess), lots happening (judging from the sound)  but the camera work was jumbled and oversliced and overspliced and confusing, and all the great stunts and work was WASTED. At the end of one sequence, I actually asked my wife, 'What did that guy die of?' Also, very confusing plot, not about much. You'd better have seen Casino Royale five minutes previously, and committed it to memory. Even then... not sure.And oy! TERRIBLE villain.He's this limp, languid, licorice-whip French guy with NO personality and NO motivation, right? He just whimpers around. The girl doesn't get killed when he tries to have her killed - he whimpers. She shows up yet again at a party - he whimpers and squirms and rolls his eyes. Sheesh. It's like... like Lindsey Graham as evil mastermind.But wait, it gets even dumber.Fast-forward. A HANDCUFFED Bond just overcomes, what, FOUR equally-trained fellow-agents in an elevator? No problem! Whump, whump, whump, he's free.But then this WIMP of a NOTHING of a bad guy has an extended fight with Bond, as if they're equally-matched, fights and fights as he whines and whimpers more loudly  and then he ends up conscious and alive! Oh. My. Gosh.So, tip to future evil masterminds: there's your problem. Stop sending your heavily-muscled, heavily-armed, martial-art-trained henchmen after Bond. Pick the guy who's over there going through the latest Good Housekeeping. He'll have a real shot at beating Bond.I didn't hate the movie, but I was disappointed. All that money they had to use, not well-spent.And Michael Medved's right, there's some anti-American and pc-stink about it also.Dudes, get a story, get a good writer, get some FUN locations, and for pete's sake get a CAMERAMAN, and do the next one right.",5,2,2,15 November 2008
Zulu," Really fine move... well, except....
","The acting is top-notch (Michael Caine is underestimated), the action is stirring, the pacing deliberate and inexorable, and the tension builds steadily.  The scenery is indeed striking, and the music underscores all the developments ably.  I gave this movie a nine.  Otherwise, I doubt I could add to others' praise.I only add this one criticism.OF COURSE there is one major religious figure, the missionary Reverend Witt, and OF COURSE he turns into a raving loon, a coward, a drunk, and therefore a hypocrite.  The only problem with that being that evidently the actual Rev. Witt was nothing of the sort, and in fact was one of two clergy who served nobly in this fight (see http://rorkesdriftvc.com/zulu.htm).  And now, forty years later, one notes that STILL it seems most comfortable for screenwriters to depict all Christians (particularly clergy) as dangerous lunatic hypocrites.  One wishes, repeatedly, that they would deal with their personal problems with God, or at least get out a bit more in a wider circle of acquaintances.That rant aside, I recommend the film highly.",9,12,18,3 April 2004
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," This is what happens when a leering 13 year old boy makes a movie
","Save yourself time and irritation.Get all your metal pots and pans out of the cupboard. Put them in a big box. Shake the box violently for a few minutes.Then imagine yourself locked in a room with an obsessive, randy, amoral, leering thirteen-year-old boy. You are forced to listen to his sniggering fantasies and knuckle-dragging notions of humor.Do that, and you've approximated the experience of enduring this movie. Honestly, it could have been a spiritual docu-tragedy about Michael Bay, subtitled Fantasies of the Fallen.Honestly, were there NO adults on the set? NOBODY who could say, 'Michael, dude — no. Just no. Now, tear that up, sit down, and come up with a *story*'? Evidently not.T:ROTF has more metal clanging in scenes where you can't tell which is doing what to which. There are humping dogs (again and again), humping robots (I kid you not), sexual language, the S-word, blasphemies, the F-bomb (I thought that made a movie 'R'), a baffling and pointless and utterly non-credible romance, the most annoying major male character since Phantom Menace or Terminator 2, the most annoying side-kick since Jar-Jar... eesh!It is as if Bay completely misunderstood what made the first movie fun to watch, extracted all the most obnoxious elements (discarding the rest), added dialog and imagery picked up in a junior high school locker room, and made a movie based on it.My regret is not bailing after the first humping dog. You have better things to do with your life. I'm sure of it.If you don't — seek help. Seriously.",2,9,21,25 October 2009
The Iron Giant," Over-hyped, yet still very, very good
","We've seen more than once that a movie which is universally raved about can tremble under the weight of its own good press.  IMHO, The Iron Giant is a movie that has been over-hyped.  I would say, for instance, that The Prince of Egypt, from every conceivable angle, is a far better animated movie.  A person could afford to miss IG; I don't think anyone should miss PoE.Having said that, I still join the chorus in praising IG.  It is really a very good cartoon.  The animation and artwork are all you've heard, yet done in a 50-ish graphical style.  The plot is interesting, and moves right along.  While I don't appreciate the one-sided 'guns-are-all-evil' (and so are hunters, depicted as the descendants of the men who killed Bambi's mom) message, I do enjoy the skepticism about arrogant government agents, and the more complex depiction of the Giant's personality.  (The latter harkens to Karloff's Frankenstein, a monster not by his own choice.)Go to the movie for a good time, not expecting the Second Coming of Christ, and you'll find your money well-spent.",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
Taken 2," The Attack Of The Coulda-Beens
","The secret to not hating this movie is in expectations. If you expect a step-up from Taken (as Aliens, or Terminator 2), you'll be angry. If you just want to see Liam Neeson and fights and explosions... well, happy day.My overriding feel is that this is like a steak pulled off the grill long before it was done. There's the germ of a good movie here. Some clever, creative writer should have spent a lot more time developing it; some clever director should have realized it; and some capable stunt-coordinator should have had a capable camera-man capture it.Instead, we get the half-baked, bloody undone thing served up on a shaky, cracked plate.Where to start? Let's take continuity and character-growth. I mean, seriously: what does a guy have to do to get a 'Trust Me, I Know What I'm Doing' card? Didn't the wife and daughter even *see* the first movie? Evidently not, because they're still disrespecting Neesons's character, deceiving him, shutting him out, and demanding that he submit everything with an explanation in triplicate. That's quickly obnoxious and boring.And then, yeah, dimwit Maggie Grace can go around tossing grenades and no one notices. Good to know about Turkey. I'm sure they appreciate that image.But you know, the premise that 'All these people you killed in the first movie had relatives, and they're ticked' is totally workable, and a good set up. But it just doesn't go anywhere. The Godfather character is picturesque, but hollow. And all the guys who get killed in this movie are just as colorless as -- more than! -- the guys they're supposedly avenging.And then it's just kind of funny: for the whole movie, most of them are just canon fodder for Liam Neeson to kill -- until the last henchman. Suddenly there's ONE GUY who's got the stuff to equal Neeson...even though he's a pudgy, relatively older guy!Who is this one man who alone is the equal of Neeson's killing machine? Have we even seen him before, among all the other nameless, sweaty, unshaven Middle Eastern types? Why is he the only capable one in the organization? Where did he get the skills that enable him to come an atom away from killing Neeson, which dozens of others COMBINED failed to do? Is there an interesting story there, a compelling character, someone with a story to rival Neeson's?We don't know. He exists only to provide a climax. I mean, it's a good scene, what I could see of it... but it had no real emotional resonance. Because unless I missed something, he just appeared from the shadowy figures at the wall, Swarthy Thug #47. A good writer could have set us up for some real tension. Too bad there wasn't one in sight.And back to that 'what I could see of it': good heavens. Really? Shaky- camera-as-substitute-for-well-done-action-choreography in a high-budget picture? Why? WHY?? With photography like that, if Neeson isn't available, maybe Ed Asner could star in Taken 3.Or me, for that matter.",6,0,0,23 February 2013
The Sixth Sense," Unusual; good writing, good acting, worth seeing
