Marie Antoinette," ABSOLUTELY GHASTLY... ever wonder why mezzo-giorno Italians put plastic seat covers over gold lame upholstery?
",Well this will answer your question This is creme fraiche and caviar topping on a pizza.Sofia Coppola has connections. Unfortunately she also has a lousy education.So we see a classic milquetoast Jew playing Louis XVI as Woody Allen(frankly I find Robert Morley more dynamic) enduring painfully his Austrian wife's courage.Lousy music... Bathos on top of pathos combined with terrible rock. poor Kirsten Dunst had to go into rehab after this... I totally sympathize. What an appalling waste of money and effort.You have to have flunked 3rd grade to get to the end of this.But of course the gang that control entertainment showered it with awards! It is all about them and has little to do with history. They deserve 7 days in a locked room with a looped Barry Lyndon.,1,11,18,24 September 2008
Midnight in Paris," 'Why don't we make a Jewish movie set in Paris with Christian characters?'
","Starting with Owen Wilson's twitchy ongoing imitation of Woody Allen himself as Gil, every situation involving his grabby neurotic fiancÃ©e Inez (a perfect JAP if there ever was one), and her supposedly WASPY Tea Party parents (who come off more like a suspicious Scarsdale dentist and his shrewish Haddassah wife) MIDNIGHT IN Paris is an amusing ethnic exercise primarily because Woody Allen doesn't know that's what he has written.It would be nice if Wilson's 'blastoff into the past' didn't include constant ahistorical errors like 'Hemingway' interrupting spouts of unintentionally parodic passages of Hemingway prose to discuss rhino hunting and bullfighting years before he had any exposure to either, and decamping to Kilimanjaro with Wilson's love interest (Marie Cotilard), years before he had ever been to Africa and while he was still living happily with first wife Hadley whose trust fund checks were barely keeping them alive.But what the hell. Watching Wilson/Woody Allen's constant bug-eyed 'Gee whizzes' as each celeb from the past (Fitzgerald, Dali, etc.) went into their star turn was unintentionally hilarious... rather like a reprise of the beginning of the guided tour of Jurassic Park, but the one truly touching sequence when Wilson/Woody somehow caught the right carriage to take a Marie Cotillard to her dream 'golden age' to Maxim's and the Moulin Rouge of the Belle epoque made it all almost worth it.Worth an Academy Award for the blurry postcard color of daytime Paris and the ability to pull the Woody Allen claque together behind a far inferior movie to the marvelous VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA... .THis is a lousy movie, but given the ethnic makeup of Hollywood, it is over-praised and at least Woody made some money this time.",1,8,20,25 February 2012
