Hereditary," A good cult film
","If you watch this film in a mood for 'The Conjuring 2', you would be very upset. But if you watch this film in a mood for 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer', you would obtain a lot pleasure.It is so great to view this whole movie is surrounded by the dense atmosphere out of the mental pressure and the shadow of death. (And the acting is great. I like it so much.) Simple to say, grandma, mother and the beheaded dauther, which means the maternal side, are components in the blood line of Hereditary. Some details show that this family is set up to be sacrificed for Paimon and I think it can make sense. This movie also reveals the truth almost entirely so it's not hard to piece the mysterious hints at all.I think many people were upset because they wanted to see full jumpscares and enjoyed in the feeling of being frightened or scared. But 'Hereditary' is obviously not that kind of movie. It actually is not only a horror film but a CULT film totally. Just like 'The VVitch'(2015 film), 'The Ritual'(2016 film) and 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer'(2017 film). Some cult films have ghosts, but 'Hereditary' just has the inapparent ghosts and strange happenings that makes people feel stunned in an instant. The only thing this film mostly emphasizes is RITUAL. Rituals make everything reasonable in this film, including causing the schizophrenia and the multiple personality disorder. Even this film is the part of the ritual. (Hah) At last, it seems that the ritual ended in Paimon gets his body. Pagans achieve their victory. On the whole, I consider it is a horror cult film about pagan's honorable road in the modern times.In the end, only one thing I must have to say: 
The biggest fault in this film is its special effect. It is a big fraction while watching. As I know, a few people laugh at mother's floating body and the following naked people in the ending scene. The laughter from audience in the theater makes all of it ridiculous. I don't mind people laughing, but I can't stand the special effect is too fake. Not real to make me feel horrible.",8,0,1,21 June 2018
Call Me by Your Name," What a countryside graffiti !!
","I think Call Me By Your Name is a heartwarming film. It describes a youthful boy learns how to explore his sexual feeling to an elder guy. It all happens in the countryside in 1983 summer in Italy. In this process, he also dates with a girl and has a romantic relationship with her, soon they break up and become friends. It seems that the whole film is such a story of a try of a young bi.I call this film 'countryside graffiti', not a negative prank, but to show the atmosphere of the whole 2 hours. Every scene goes slowly but clearly. That clearness is what I praise for. When they call each other by their names on the bed, I think my sense comes to the climax as them.Around a open-minded family and a lot of Archaeological knowledge, I like this simple story. Those background settings makes this film more interesting. Although it is not the 1st boy-love movie in my mind, it can still be added to my top 10 list.In the end, Oliver calls back to Elio, telling him he's married. In that moment, the acting of the young Chalamet is very awesome. His sorrowful stare just like a spear piercing into my heart. So touched.",8,2,5,12 February 2018
Evil Dead," Faces at different times
","The Evil Dead (1981) tells of a story that a crowd of young people come to a cabin and accidentally evoke the demons in the wood through 'Book of the Dead'. Actually to say, I love its tempo! The tight plot moves the tempo of this film forward so quickly, as if there are so many monstrous scenes bumping into my sight form every corner. Even every step the film characters take brings me the feeling that something evil is always watching every breath and every second. However, the tempo of the re-make Evil Dead (2013) is apparently slower than the original. But I think it is a great re-make version! Because the atmosphere of terror in the re-make is better than the original through the delicate camera movements and exquisite film set. In the plot, the clichÃ© is not as simple as the original one. It has the new idea of some gore-spreading and slaughtering scenes. It is very creative. Only one thing I have to say is the impression of the faces in the film at different times. It seems that the makeup techniques and computer-generated images in 1981 are old-fashioned, but I think the possessed faces in the original is more horrible than the faces in the re-make. These faces in the original and the symptoms of the possessed people make me think of The Exorcist (1973). Maybe the horror films about the possessed at that time all do that alike makeup technique so that the faces are similar.",8,1,3,11 July 2016
