",This movie should be seen by everyone who believes that the war against terror is stupid or that George Bush lied. It illuminates and clarifies what we are up against in this war: an irrational group of people who believe that the United States and our way of life should be obliterated.The people on this flight exemplify the best of what the US and its people stand for. And we must not forget who we are fighting and why.There should be no partisan differences in this regard. Democrats and Republicans should agree that we must win this war or spend the rest of eternity in fear.,10,3,8,12 May 2006
