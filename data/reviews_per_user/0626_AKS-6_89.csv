The Blair Witch Project," Not scary -- spooky
","I'm quite surprised here since I liked this film. I'm not saying it's a masterpiece or the 'scariest film ever made' because it's not. However, I found it quite spooky. I didn't jump or anything, but when you think about how these people must have felt out in the woods and if you have any imagination at all, it's got to be at least a little bit spooky. I found 'The Blair Witch Project' to be quite fascinating and interesting. The madness of it all is what drives the film forward not the question whether there is a witch or not. And thank you very much, for there not being any 'scary' witch seen in the film. I hate the skeleton in 'Hellraiser', I hate the monsters in 'In the Mouth of Madness' and 'The Faculty', I hate Jason in 'Friday the 13th'Â… What you see is not always what makes a film scary or not, it's where your imagination leads you that makes a film scary or spooky. Now, some of you will have that kind of imagination that makes you not see the spookiness in this film (nothing wrong with that) and others will have the kind of imagination that will make them think this is the scariest fim they have ever seen (and I envy those people). I'm stuck in between, but I have to admit that I enjoyed the film and it was much better than I expected it to be since no one I know have liked it. I would probably give this film a 6 out of 10 because I think it deserved it. What I didn't understand, though, was the ending. I figured that 'now it begins -- the *scary* parts' and then it just ended. Spooky, not scary. (I saw 'Forces of Nature' as well today, and I have to admit it, after having seen that disgrace of a film even 'See No Evil, Hear No Evil' [Sorry, Kevin Spacey, :-)] would have been a great film, so maybe that's why I found BWP quite entertaining.)",7,0,1,29 January 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Great film
","I didn't have any high expectations when I rented this film today (you'll understand why if you read my Pi comment). I was certainly wrong when I expected to be bored by this film. Requiem for a Dream is infinitely better than Aronofsky's earlier movie Pi. Requiem for a Dream is probably the most depressing movie I've seen in years, but it is also fascinating, interesting and quite brilliant. The acting is fantastic and the editing is interesting. The score is also brilliant with its mix of old and new sounds. Great movie! (7/10)",7,0,1,16 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than expected
","I have to say that I wasn't expecting much when I decided to watch this movie. I am no fan of the first Star Wars-movies (although they are by no means bad films) and I'd heard that The Phantom Menace wasn't close to being as good as them. The Phantom Menace is certainly not better than any of the first Star Wars-movies, but it is only marginally worse. I found it to be quite entertaining and I didn't find the loathed Jar Jar Binks as annoying as most people seem to find him. However, the movie was boring at times and the script isn't very exciting. Still, it's not a failure, if you ask me. (5/10",5,0,2,16 May 2002
G.I. Jane," Flashdance with more muscles
","This movie is very much like 'Flashdance', you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals. That film is probably the most boring film I have ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny. 'G.I. Jane' is much better than that film, but that doesn't say much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there's high music and we get to see her fight and everything, but it is certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting, but the script is too clichéd and Ridley Scott can't do anything about that. Well, like I said... It's better than 'Flashdance'... (4/10)",4,4,10,5 November 2000
Training Day," Entertaining
","[Contains what some might consider SPOILERS!]Training Day is a pretty standard cop movie. Corrupt cops isn't exactly a new theme in modern cinema. It is, however, quite interesting to see Hawke's character struggle with what he sees Washington's character do.The fact that we only get to follow Jake and Alonzo for a day is both the movie's strength and its weakness. The strenght is that the pace is quick and the movie is never boring. The weakness is that it seems a bit over the top for all those things to happen in less than 24 hours.Since Denzel Washington is in the film the acting is of course brilliant. Ethan Hawke also does a great job.Overall, Training Day is entertaining and never boring. A good film: nothing more, nothing less. (6/10)",6,1,12,9 November 2001
Erin Brockovich," Albert Finney is brilliant
","Okay, this film is Julia Roberts. There's no way of getting away from that. It might be a little different from her earlier films, and the role is perhaps a little more serious (a *lot* more serious than e.g. 'Pretty Woman') than what she usually does, but it is still very much a Julia Roberts vehicle. She has got time to shine in this one. I'm not saying that that is a bad thing, because in this film it is not. Roberts is very charming and actually convincing as Erin Brockovich. The story lacks any depth, but it is still told in a satisfactory way by Steven Soderbergh. It's not his best film, but it's certainly very entertaining if about twenty minutes too long. I have to say, though, as much as I like Julia Roberts in this film, that Albert Finney was truly magnificent as her boss -- truly a great performance. (6/10)",6,1,2,1 May 2000
Meet the Parents," Funny and entertaining
","Since I didn't expect much before I saw this film, I was quite surprised when Meet the Parents turned out to be very entertaining and funny from the beginning to the end. Most comedies are very funny the first thirty minutes or so and then keeps going and going with about one joke per 15 minutes. That's not the case with this movie. Sure, one can discuss whether Ben Stiller can play more than one character or not, but his acting style suits this film perfectly. Of course, De Niro is brilliant as the father-in-law from hell. Meet the Parents is a genuinely funny and entertaining comedy. (7/10)",7,0,0,30 December 2000
Se7en," Should I blame the director?
","I saw this film for the second time the other night just to see if I can understand and appreciate what all the hype is/was about. Well, I didn't understand it this time either. I'm not saying that Se7en is a bad film, because it is not. The film is quite good -- but not as good as everybody else seems to think -- and not nearly as great as the masterpiece it has so often been compared with: The Silence of the Lambs.However, great acting, great cinematography, great production design, haunting music, and a great script. But, somehow it seems as if the sum of these parts is *less* than the value of the individual part. That is strange -- and a shame. Should I blame the director?As for the great acting: Morgan Freeman must be mentioned, he's almost always brilliant. And -- naturally -- Kevin Spacey in his small but important role as John Doe. Spacey has a presence that is almost uncanny. He is as brilliant as ever. He's fantastic.Shame about the film though. (6/10)",8,0,1,14 April 1999
The Big Lebowski," Really strange and really funny
","This is really a strange movie. But strange in a good way. It was so funny and entertaining and the characters were just outrageous. Being Swedish I of course enjoyed seeing Peter Stormare in a small role as a German nihilist fond of 'lingonberry pancakes'. I also thought Julianne Mores feministic character was very funny. John Goodman, Jeff Bridges and Steve Buscemi were all great in the leading roles. 'The Big Lebowski' is without a doubt a really, really strange *and* a really, really funny movie. It must be seen to be believed!",7,1,3,16 May 1999
Fight Club," Brilliant in many ways
","'Fight Club' is a great film. It's the first film by David Fincher where I have left the cinema feeling rather uplifted and happy, and it's the first film by Fincher that I think is really, really good. It starts right at the opening credits: it's probably the best opening credits I have ever seen (yes, better than Se7en's).I had read Chuck Palahniuk's novel a couple of times before I saw the film and I like it (the novel) even if it's far from a masterpiece. Even though I like the book, the film is absolutely brilliant in its own right. Jim Uhls's script is fantastic. The comedy is also great, it's been a long time since I've laughed this much during a film. The cinematography is great, the music is perfect for the film, the dialogue is brilliant.The acting is, of course, top notch. Brad Pitt is often overlooked as an actor because of the famous face and the famous body. This is a shame, because I think he's a really good actor although this is the first time I think he's great. Helena Bonham Carter is, surprisingly, perfectly cast. I could see no other actress portraying Marla Singer. Meat Loaf is good as well. I could go on and on about Edward Norton, but that will probably bore you so let's just say that, even though this isn't another Aaron Stampler- or Derek Vinyard mind-blowing performance, he is an acting genius and that his performance in 'Fight Club' is brilliant.The production design is another thing that is worth mentioning as something really good. As everybody will probably realise there is a 'but' here and it's coming now: there is sadly a rather boring part in the film right before the brilliant last 10-15 minutes. It lasts for about 20 minutes and it slows down the film and makes it rather unbelievable (to those who have seen the film; I'm not referring to the most apparent thing when I say that some of it is unbelievable). Well, it's such a shame because if those twenty minutes had been more concentrated or something I would without a doubt have given this film a 10 here at IMDb. As it is now, I gave it an 9 after much consideration. Very close to being *incredibly* brilliant, as it is now 'Fight Club' is 'only' brilliant.",9,0,1,6 January 2000
Memento," Intelligent and original
","I really wish that I could have seen Memento without having a clue about the plot and the structure of the story. I think I would have enjoyed the film even more than I did now if I had been surprised by it.As I said, though, I enjoyed Memento. In fact, I enjoyed it very much. It is an intelligent film, truly original, and it is interesting from beginning to end (or rather from end to beginning). Guy Pearce delivers a brilliant performance and the supporting actors are great as well. Memento is a movie that you will think about after you've left the cinema, whether you liked it or not. The only thing that I didn't quite like was the fact that it felt a bit too long. (8/10)",8,0,2,13 November 2001
Amistad," Good, but flawed, film
","Well, I have tried to avoid Amistad as long as possible. Being a true film lover, though, I know that I will end up watching the films I'm sure I'm not going to like eventually so there's really no need trying to avoid it. (Haven't seen 'Jurassic Park' yet, though, but it's just a matter of time.) So, I rented 'Amistad' a couple of days ago to get it over and done with and to a certain extent I was pleasantly surprised. It *was* better than the rumours I had heard and it was an interesting story and the ending was a total surprise to me (I'm not American so that particular event in American and Spanish history was not familiar to me). I thought I knew how it was going to end, but it didn't end that way.So, the film was good. The acting was also good. Morgan Freeman, Stellan Skarsgård, Nigel Hawthorne... Three of my favourite actors all of them. Anthony Hopkins seemed to do his usual routine, though (I'm thinking about 'Legends of the Fall' in particular), and Matthew McConaughey was not good at all. Djimon Hounsou impressed me the most though, he was excellent.The major flaw in this film was its lenght. It was *at least* 45 minutes too long, sadly it was hard to keep up interest for that long. That has nothing to do with the story, of course, rather with the script and the directing.(6/10)",6,0,2,6 December 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Good -- but a disappointment
","First of all - the movie is good. It is not so good, however, that it deserved an Oscar. A case of lobbyism, I presume. The plot is quite fascinating and I am impressed by the writer. But it seems like there is still something missing in the movie. It is rather tiresome sometimes, and there are no really hilarious scenes. And why did Will and Viola 'get their kits off' so soon? That was a disappointment.As for the acting, Ben Affleck was great in his small part which came as a bit of a surprise for me. Joseph Fiennes has charisma, but I believe Affleck would have been better cast as Shakespeare. Judi Dench is of course great, not to mention Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth. The real disappointment was Gwyneth Paltrow. It is a shame that she was in the movie at all, she basically destroyed it for me.I *did* like it though and give it: 6/10.",6,1,2,24 March 1999
12 Monkeys," Brilliant sci-fi
","[Contains spoilers!]This movie is so fascinating that every time I have watched it I wish I could forget everything that has happened in it so that I will be able to experience the film for the first time again. I remember the first time I saw the ending and realized that James Cole watched himself die and how fascinating (and terrible) that really is.The script is very complex, however, I must say it never gets *too* complex because if it did I'd probably not like this film as much as I do. It is without a doubt Bruce Willis's best movie to date (yes, this film is *much* better than the overrated 'The Sixth Sense') and Brad Pitt does one of his best performances -- it's actually quite interesting to see that some of the things that Jeffrey Goines (Pitt) says in this film might as well have come out of Tyler Durden's (Pitt's character in the masterpiece 'Fight Club') mouth. Pitt seems to be drawn to characters who hates consumerism.I guess I could go on and on about how brilliant the script is, and the directing, and the production design, but I'll just say: 'Twelve Monkeys' is a mind-blowing film and if you haven't seen it you should do it as soon as possible. Terry Gilliam is a genius!! (And as a kid I loved his 'Time Bandits'.) I have voted an 8 (out of 10) for 'Twelve Monkeys' here at IMDb.",8,0,0,4 April 2000
Shaun of the Dead," Funny and entertaining
","Shaun of the Dead is one of three 'zombie' films that I have seen in my life. 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead (the remake) are the other two. SotD is probably the film that I like the least out of these three. That doesn't mean that I think SotD is bad, quite the contrary, I think it's rather good. It is funny, entertaining and, at times, gory. What makes me say that it is only 'rather good' then? Well, I think the first 30 minutes or so border on boring. There are definitely a few laughs, but nothing more. However, from the moment Shaun and Ed realise something is horribly wrong the movie works on all levels. Some scenes are hilarious (like the one where Ed and Shaun discuss which records to throw at the zombies, *while* the zombies are walking towards them) and some scenes are actually quite touching.Too bad about the slow beginning, but in the end it turned out to be a very entertaining film. (7/10)",7,0,1,1 January 2005
Elizabeth," Quite good
","Now I have finally seen 'Elizabeth' and in many ways it was better than I had expected. It has gotten pretty good reviews everywhere, but I had nevertheless expected a rather boring film. It was not boring at all, even if Elizabeth is so well-known that I knew what was going to happen (and *not* happen) most of the time. So, okay, that means it wasn't that suspenseful for me, but I still enjoyed it. Cate Blanchett was great as Elizabeth. While Joseph Fiennes has enough charisma for a hundred men, I still think that he could have done a better job. This is the second time that he has disappointed me since I don't think he was all that great as Shakespeare in 'Shakespeare in Love'. He wasn't *bad* in 'Elizabeth', though, I have to say, just not good enough.If you liked this,  I recommend the French film 'La Reine Margot'/'Queen Margot' which is a very similar film only better. It's also based upon historical facts and portrays a very violent time in French history.",8,0,2,3 January 2000
Billy Elliot," Sheer brilliance
","When you walk out of the cinema after having seen a film like Billy Elliot, you can't help but have a wide grin on your face. Sure, you may look like an idiot, but who cares after a movie experience like this one? Billy Elliot is without a doubt the best film I have seen this year at the cinema (even better than Fight Club, and we all know [I hope] that FC is a brilliant film). It's a typical British film, and I mean that in the best way possible. Brilliant actors, a great story, great production design (feels like you're there), great direction, sadness and jokes and that special mood and tone of a British comedy/drama. And Jamie Bell is magnificent as Billy. I just have one thing to say to director Stephen Daldry and all the actors and everyone else who worked on Billy Elliot: thanks for making this film! (10/10)",7,1,1,22 November 2000
The Mummy," Silly, silly and yet again: silly
","How silly can a film get? Well, I'm not an expert when it comes to silly films but I think 'The Mummy' is about as silly as a film can get; 'The Mummy' and 'Weird Science'. :-) The only redeeming qualities of this film are the special effects and the fact that it rarely gets boring (although it *is* boring at times). And Rachel Weisz character, as well as her acting, is also silly. The silliest thing of all though: the mummy!! At one point, though, he looks quite like T-800 in 'The Terminator', but that says more about the originality of 'The Terminator' than anything about this film. Silly, silly, silly. (3 or 4/10)",4,0,0,5 February 2000
Constantine," Neither good nor bad
","Constantine is the movie version of comic book/graphic novel Hellblazer. I hadn't even heard of Hellblazer until I heard about Constantine. Therefore, I cannot say if Constantine is a good or bad adaptation. What I can say, however, is that it's an okay film in its own right. It's neither good or bad.What I liked about Constantine was the look of the movie when it comes to cinematography and production design. I also liked that, for a movie I imagined to be action packed, the action scenes weren't that many. There _are_ quite a few action scenes of course, but the movie doesn't seem to be all about the next big action set piece.Now, what I didn't like was the special effects. They're not bad, but a demon made out of bugs made me think of The Mummy and that is never good. When it comes to demons in movies I believe that less is more. At least if you want the audience to feel suspense. I also had a problem with the slow pace. The movie was about two hours long, but it felt more like 2½ hours.When you know you're going to watch a Keanu Reeves film you know not to expect great acting. At least not from Mr Reeves himself. However, I must say that Constantine is the type of movie where at least I didn't notice that Keanu Reeves isn't very good. I think the role of Constantine suited him rather well.So, Constantine is a rather good film. Unfortunately it is also slow-paced, boring at times and too long. (4/10)",4,3,11,6 March 2005
The Others," Interesting drama, but predictable
","This film is said to be a drama/horror film. It is a drama full stop. There are no chills and thrills in the movie. Don't get me wrong, The Others is a good movie. It's slow, but always interesting. But it is also one of the most predictable films I have seen in the cinema for a long, long time. I had the ending figured out too soon for it to be a really good movie experience.That said, Nicole Kidman is fantastic in the movie. Amenábar is obviously a good director, but I think the movie suffers from being labelled a 'horror' movie when it is obviously a Gothic drama. (6/10)",7,0,0,16 February 2002
Chicken Run," Entertaining, but disappointing
","I've done it again! Read too many reviews, too many articles. Basically, I've expected too much from Chicken Run. Don't get me wrong, it's an impressive film and it's thoroughly entertaining (most of the time), but the film should have been at least half an hour shorter, it seemed to move too slowly and repeat itself too many times. The pie machine set piece was brilliant though! (6/10)",6,2,3,24 April 2001
L.A. Confidential," Intelligent, intense, and brilliant
","The first thing I thought when I turned off the video was 'Wow! What a movie!' Very rarely I get as absorbed as this when I watch a film. The story-line is great, and the acting is brilliant! Kevin Spacey has to be one of the greatest actors ever, and Kim Basinger was a worthy Academy Award winner. I want to see more movies like this; intelligent, intense, brilliant, and entertaining.I'd give it an 8 out of 10.",7,1,3,3 April 1999
X-Men," Wicked film
","[This comment contains what some people might consider SPOILERS]First of all, I had never heard of the X-Men comic book before I heard about Bryan Singer directing this film, I've never read the comic and I haven't got a clue where to find copies, so this comment is written from an 'uninformed' point of view.'X-Men' was better than I expected. It had a good plot, a very fascinating story indeed, good actors (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen need I say more?), and nice visual and special effects. My main complaints, though, are: Toad -- he is just too close to the ridiculous -- and the fact that it is too short. I don't mean too short as in 'Bryan Singer wasn't able to tell his story in that short amount of time,' I simply mean that the film was so darn entertaining that I wanted it to go on for at least thirty minutes more. Nevermind. To get back to the acting: Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are the stand-outs of course, but Anna Paquin was much better than I expected and Hugh Jackman was brilliant as Wolverine. And Wolverine God, if he was around I'd swoon just so that he could catch me in his strong arms. Jealous of Jean Grey [Famke Janssen]? Me? Certainly not! :-) As for that cute little semi-love story I really think that Wolverine should wait until Rogue (Paquin) gets a little older. They would be a great couple. Of the X-Men there are two characters who are let down by the script: Cyclops and Storm. Cyclops walks around looking cool, not much more, and though Storm is indeed stunningly beautiful I really hope that she gets more room in the inevitable sequel. And of course, all the villains, except for Magneto, are also only shadows of what they could be, but I guess that we will get to know them when the sequel arrives (with that ending there just *has* to be a sequel).In short: Stewart + McKellen + WOLVERINE + fascinating story + good direction/ing = wicked film!! (8/10)",8,0,0,5 September 2000
The Terminator," Brilliant action film
","This is one of my favourite films. I've watched it so many times... I still prefer T2, though. But this film is certainly one of the most original action films ever made. It's intense, exciting, full of suspense and the action scenes actually don't bore me. [*Possible* spoiler follows.] And I love the little love story between Reese and Sarah Connor. It is so cute in a very innocent way since Reese actually has loved Sarah for all those years because of a photo just like a fourteen year old girl thinks she loves Brad Pitt.Brilliant action flick. 8/10",8,0,0,22 November 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Beautiful film
","This is one of the most amazingly beautiful films I have ever seen. The costumes, the cinematography, the production design, the two leads (Depp and Ricci) et cetera. It is worth it to watch this film just to experience the dark beauty of it. However, the film is quite good in its own right. It's a nice mix of horror and beheadings and a little comedy as well. Depp is brilliant as Ichabod Crane -- he does a lot of swooning while trying to remain calm. But hey, if a headless Christopher Walken on a black horse was coming after you set to separate your head from your body with a long sword, wouldn't you swoon at least once as well? :-) 'Sleepy Hollow' definitely got that dark Tim Burton-feel over it, while it is not as strange as some of his other films, and there's some comic relief as well and thank god for that because otherwise all those beheadings would have been insufferable. (7/10)",7,0,0,3 April 2000
Blade II," Very entertaining
","[Conatins SPOILERS]I just recently saw Blade (the first movie) for the first time. I'd only heard bad things about it, and so was very excited when I saw it the first time and realised I liked it. Sure, it wasn't a masterpiece, but it was great entertainment. This is also what I feel about the second movie. It's basically the same movie with great action sequences, great make-up, great special effects and a cool Wesley Snipes as the eponymous hero. I liked the idea of Blade working together with vampires, as well. I found the Reapers to be rather... silly, though. The 'Alien-esque' mouths felt kind of over the top. But, overall I really enjoyed Blade II. If you liked the first, you'll certainly like this one as well. (6/10)",6,0,2,10 May 2002
Alien," Not as good as 'Aliens'
","It has been ten years since I saw 'Alien' last -- I'm much more familiar with the sequel which I watch at least two times a year. What I remember thinking the first time I saw this film, back in the 80s, is that it was boring. Well, that was a little unfair, but I was just thirteen or something like that and sitting through a movie like this wasn't exactly what I enjoyed. I enjoy 'Alien' more now, but even though I don't find it boring anymore, I can't help but feel that it is nothing compared to James Cameron's 'Aliens'. For instance, 'Alien' is not nearly as suspenseful as Cameron's film, the action sequences are lamer (can't blame Scott for that, though, since his film is seven years older than Cameron's), and generally much more happens in the sequel. I also feel that the chemistry between the actors in 'Aliens' are better than in this film. Naturally, though, 'Alien' is much better than David Fincher's third instalment in the series (and he went on to make 'Fight Club', wow!) and also way better than the fourth instalment. In short: it is a good film, but as far as the series go, this is definitely one of those rare cases where the sequel is actually better than the first film!",8,0,6,20 April 2000
Glory," One of the best films ever!
","Having read all the other comments on 'Glory' I just have to say that I totally agree with the ones who loves this film.'Glory' is the best war time film I have ever seen as well as one of the best films (all genres counted) ever. I have not seen it for two years, but after I saw 'Saving Private Ryan' I started to think about 'Glory' and how superior 'Glory' is to SPR. I even mentioned 'Glory' as the better film in my review of SPR. I saw it for the first time on TV in 1995. I had missed the first 30 minutes but was still unable to switch channel after watching only a few minutes of the movie.I cried for about an hour after the movie had ended, mainly because I spent an hour writing about the movie in my diary and therefore remembered all the scenes once again. I have seen it one time since (and missed the first 40 minutes!!) and I was still as impressed by the film and the actors as I was the first time.",10,0,1,21 August 1999
Bridget Jones's Diary," Brilliant comedy, very entertaining
","I have not read Helen Fielding's novel upon which this film is based, and I have no wish to do so after I have seen the film. Don't get me wrong, though, I thought the movie was absolutely brilliant, but I'm sure that the novel will be a disappointment since it can't possibly be as good as this film (and a friend of mine dislikes the novel intensely, and since I don't have the time to read all the books I want to read I trust her judgment on this one).Bridget Jones's Diary is very entertaining, often hilarious, and also rather cute. RenÃ©e Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth all deliver fantastic performances. Firth is the 'favourite' since he's also been brilliant in the best televisions series ever made (Pride and Prejudice) and one of my all time favourite films (Valmont). This film was actually better than I expected, and I expected much before me and my sister saw it at the cinema today. Brilliant film, another top British comedy. (8/10)",8,0,2,21 July 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," Very entertaining
","As usual when it comes to teen comedies I didn't expect much, so I was pleasantly surprised when '10 Things I Hate About You' turned out to be a very entertaining, funny and genuinely likeable film. All the characters are interesting, although some of them seem to be the typical teen comedy archetypes, and the actors' performances were overall great. I'm thinking about Julia Stiles and Heath Sedge in particular. And you have to see the end credits as there are some really funny out takes there in which we see the cast do the wrong things and start to laugh et cetera.So, '10 thingsÂ…' is a really good teen comedy and I recommend it to anyone.",7,0,0,4 February 2000
Notting Hill," Fine romantic comedy
","First of all, I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies. Sure, I adore 'The Wedding Singer' and a few other films, but I'm not exactly interested in the next 'big' romantic comedy. However, there are a few movies belonging to this genre that are so charming that I can't resist them. 'The Wedding Singer' is one of those, as is this film -- 'Notting Hill'. It's very funny and it's very romantic. I saw it for the second time tonight and I liked it even better than I did the first time. Hugh Grant is absolutely adorable, Julia Robert's character is charming. Some of the scenes (e.g. 'The Horse & Hound'-scene) are absolutely hilarious. This is a much better film than Richard Curtis's 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', and it's a masterpiece compared with the other Roberts-film 'Runaway Bride'.In short, 'Notting Hill' is a fine romantic comedy with appealing performances by the two leads. (7/10)",7,1,1,31 October 1999
American Pie," Average film
","The first half hour or so of 'American Pie' is a pure waste of time, very boring, very unfunny, very desperate. In fact, the script is more desperate than the teenagers in this film. However, after thirty minutes or so, the film gets better, it's even cute at times, but I really don't know what all the fuss is about. So, teenagers talking about sex, having sex -- who cares? The funniest character is without a doubt Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) and the best line (because it was so unexpected) belongs to Alyson Hannigan's geeky character. Well, not very good, not very bad. Average. (5/10)",5,1,1,1 July 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Brilliant in every way
","[Contains SPOILERS!]After all the hype, I had almost decided not to see The Fellowship of the Ring at the cinema. I was tired of hearing about the film, and I had been tired of it for quite a while. Since I'm writing this comment today, I obviously went to the cinema anyway... and I must tell you that I'm very glad I did. The Fellowship of the Ring was a brilliant film. Great action sequences, great bad guys (Saruman, the different warrior 'species'), a fantastic and fascinating story. It's at least ten years since I read The Lord of the Rings so I was quite surprised that e.g. Boromir died. The cast is also great and it wouldn't be fair to mention just a few when all of them were so good. I can't wait a year for the sequel! (8-9/10)",9,0,0,2 January 2002
Cast Away," Good film
","Cast Away is a very impressing film when Chuck is stranded on the desert island. There are no cop outs here: no crying fiancÃ© in the US, no melodramatic music, no dangers apart from loneliness. Quite brilliant. However, in 'the real world' the movie lacks pace and suspense and Helen Hunt offers another mediocre performance. Cast Away is a good film, even brilliant at times, but it does not deliver all the time. (6/10)",6,0,1,21 January 2001
Armageddon," Good entertainment in spite of flaws
","'Armageddon' is one of those films that you are not supposed to like. Probably because it's more about special effects than an interesting script. So, having said that, I must admit that even though I didn't want to like it I actually did. Sure, I'm not saying that I like it in the same way I like, for instance, Bergman's 'Smiles of a Summer Night' or Tamahori's 'Once Were Warriors', but I still like it. It's not a masterpiece, but I think it is great entertainment and sometimes that's exactly what I need, two hours of watching a film that doesn't force me use my brain too much.And Billy Bob Thornton's in it! I actually didn't know that before I saw this film (shame on me, because Billy Bob is one of my favourite actors). And Steve Buscemi was hilarious. Peter Stormare was kind of irritating, he needs to get other parts than the ones he's been doing lately (like a German nihilist in 'The Big Lebowski' and Velvet in '8MM'), he was still pretty funny though. Bruce Willis was not very good, I think we're all tired of watching him save the world or a city or whatever. Liv Taylor is not the best actress around, but then her part didn't demand much, so I guess she did alright. Ben Affleck was nothing special. I hardly remember he was in the film at all.Well, good entertainment, at times a lousy script, though, and good performances from at least two people of the castÂ… I'm not ashamed to give this film 5/10.",5,1,1,16 December 1999
Pitch Black," Visually brilliant
","As far as sci-fi thrillers go, this is a good one. Sure, people being attacked by man-eating insectlike aliens isn't exactly the epitome of originality, but Twohy's execution is good. Also, I can't help but like a film which is so interesting to watch for purely visual reasons. The light is either an ice-cold blue, a searing yellow, or, well, pitch black. The camera angles are great as well.Like I said, the story isn't exactly original, but I liked the fact that Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a complex character until the end, and Diesel certainly is the right actor to portray the murderer. I particularly like how he says the last line which goes [something like]: 'Tell them he died somewhere on that planet.'I think it's obvious that I liked Pitch Black. Sure, it ain't no Aliens, but then this is obviously low-budget and that's even more impressing.A 'pleasant' surprise. (7/10)",7,0,0,14 January 2001
American Psycho," Clever adaptation of Ellis's novel
","'American Psycho' is a very clever adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's cult novel. There are very gruesome murders in the film, but you never get to see them which I am grateful for. The Patrick Bateman of this film (brilliantly portrayed by Christian Bale) is not the Bateman I imagined while reading the book, I don't know why, but the Bateman I saw before me was more cool and distanced. However, I like this Bateman better (as a character in a film/book, not as a personality) and Bale really brings something special to the part. Truly a great performance. Other than that, prepare to laugh a lot while watching the film. It's a satire and it's *very* funny. For example, Bateman's monologues about music before he kills and some very funny scenes involving business cards et cetera et cetera. However, it isn't a masterpiece and while it's a good film I still feel there's something missing. I don't know what, though, but I'll have to give 'American Psycho' a 6 out of 10 = good.",6,27,54,4 June 2000
The Shining," Intense, disturbing and *great*
","I have read the Stephen King novel upon which this film is based. It was probably ten years ago, though, when I was very young, so I don't remember much of it. However, I do know that I wasn't scared by the book at all. This film, by Stanley Kubrick (one of my fave directors), scares me. Well, I don't know if 'scare' is the correct word, but it certainly makes me feel *very* uneasy. Watching 'The Shining' is a very intense movie experience, much like watching 'The Exorcist'. The brilliant music, the direction, the acting and the camera angles adds up to a very strange and disturbing movie indeed. I wouldn't call 'The Shining' a masterpiece, but I will not hesitate to say that it is certainly a great film and one of the best horror movies I have ever seen.",9,1,2,9 October 1999
American Beauty," Sheer brilliance
","[This comment contains spoilers.]'American Beauty' is a perfect film. The cast, the script, the score, the directing well, everything is perfect. I hardly know what to say about this film because even though I cannot stop thinking about it (scenes from the film keep playing in my head and everything from advertising to a journalist's column in a newspaper can make me remember certain scenes from the film) I find myself almost at a loss for words. This is because 'American Beauty' is true. I have never seen a film that is so true. The shallowness of Angela which she hides under a mask of sexual experience, which is a lie, and then a glimpse of depth in her person, a hope for depth, when she actively takes interest in another person's life by asking Lester (Spacey) how he's doing. And that is just one example of the magnificent characterization in this film. How the film portrays Lester's metamorphosis is even more impressive. And by the end, when he realizes that what's important is his wife and daughter, not the image of his old self, it's completely breathtaking. Of course, without Lester chasing the old ghost of himself, youth lost, he would never have learnt that. And it's sad that he had to die right after feeling happy and fulfilled. And when Lester tells the audience of the never-ending last second of life, it's truly beautiful. He talks of the feel of his grandmother's skin, about Carolyn (Bening) and then he tells us he saw Jane and Jane. I think it's beautiful how he mentions her twice.Naturally, I could talk about every character's metamorphosis, but then this 'review' would be too long to ever be read so I'll stop there even though I'd love to talk about the Burnhams' neighbours as well.Does my comment make 'American Beauty' seem too serious? Well, fear not, because it's also one of the funniest films I've seen the last few years (together with the very funny and brilliant 'Fight Club'). The humour and jokes ranges from the sophisticated and witty to the old 'Ooops, tripped on somebody's foot there!' Pure brilliance. Awe-inspiring performances from Spacey (of course), Bening, Bentley, and Cooper. Impressive performances from Birch and Suvari. The script is perfect and the directing likewise. 'American Beauty' is a film that will make you laugh and (maybe) cry, but most importantly; it will make you feel and think. 10/10",9,1,2,11 March 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant
","'Terminator 2' I can't even begin to describe what I feel about this film. I saw this film at the cinema here in Sweden when I was 14 years old back in 1991 (has it been that long?) and it is one of those 'WOW!'-experiences. It kind of defines why my obsession with films started (although that particular interest didn't become a real obsession until 1994). You know I got to bring out the dear ol' 10 for this one. :-) Anyway, T2 is the first films I have become O-B-S-E-S-S-E-D with, I can't even begin to explain how much I loved this movie. I mean, I look through my diary from that time now and all I write about is T2, after watching it one (1) time I knew most lines by heart! It is truly amazing. I got the 1992 T2 calendar and everything :-) It is almost pathetic, but hey, it's the truth!So, basically, this is the best sci-fi/action *ever* (together with Cameron-directed 'Aliens'). I have probably seen it fifty times, maybe even more. It continues to fascinate and entertain me. Brilliant! Action at its best! (10/10)",10,1,1,28 October 2000
Save the Last Dance," Too clichéd to be really interesting
","[This comment contains SPOILERS!]The main problem with Save the Last Dance is that it is too clichéd. We've been there, done that several times before. Also, some scenes were very embarrassing because they were so silly. E.g. when Sara is auditioning and Derek runs up on stage. Oh please... The same point could have been made in a more subtle way. Having said that, though, I must say that the film was also very entertaining, the music was great and the acting was more than just okay, especially Julia Stiles was impressive.

Being John Malkovich," Disappointed -- still a good film though
","I wish I could never expect things from films, before I have seen them. In fact, I wish films would be released in Sweden at the same time as in the USA. I have come to the conclusion (after having seen 'Being John Malkovich') that *no* film could ever live up to the high expectations I had when I walked into the cinema today. I actually had this feeling of unreality when I sat down at my seat, I was like: 'I can't believe I'm actually going to watch this film!' The reason for me thinking that is 1) that I have longed to see it for so long and 2) that I live in a small town (population: 95,000) in Sweden where it wasn't even certain that 'Being John Malkovich' would be shown. So, of course, I was hugely disappointed. Let me tell you right away, though, that I liked the film. The premise is totally bizarre and very fascinating, the acting is brilliant (especially Catherine Keener and John Malkovich), and it was rather entertaining. However, it is also about twenty minutes too long, and I think the original story was taken too far. In the end, it wasn't very funny anymore, only sad since you realize that none of the people in the film are likeable at all, with the exception of poor John Malkovich, who is being used and abused in the worst way, :-). A disappointment, but nevertheless a good film.",6,1,2,2 May 2000
Face_Off," Great action movie with many 'cool' scenes
","I have seen Face/Off several times. I've just realized why this movie is so great compared with most action flicks: it has a *story* to tell. It's not just explosions and blood and heroes and villains; it is so much more. However, a few things separate this action film from action masterpieces such as 'Aliens' and 'Terminator 2': a few totally unnecessary scenes: such as the last (very boring) fight on board some boats. That bit always irritates me.Few movies boasts as many 'cool' scenes as this one though. How about Castor Troy (Cage) walking to his private jet with his coat flapping in the wind? Or the mirror-scene in which Archer and Troy are looking in the mirrors and still aiming at their enemies face (complicated I know). Or the scene in the church where everybody is pointing a gun at each other and the doves are flying about?Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are both great, as almost always.One thing that I really don't like: the ending! My God! Why do films like these always have to end in such a predictable and perfect way?Nevertheless, great action flick even if it can't compete with Aliens and Terminator 2: 9/10.",9,1,2,24 April 1999
Collateral," Great action thriller
","Collateral is a great action thriller by Michael Mann. The premise isn't the most original (a normal guy -- played by Jamie Foxx -- gets drawn into a chain of events that he can't get out of), but the execution is exquisite. The movie looks great. Cinematography, editing... everything. It also actually works as a thriller: I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat a couple of times which doesn't happen often anymore. Compare it to another thriller (very different though) that I just saw. It was Taking Lives and it tries so hard to put you at the edge of your seat, but only manages to be boring. It feels like Mann doesn't even try, but he pulls it off anyway.The acting is great as well. Tom Cruise as a bad guy. Grey hair, grey suit. We haven't seen him in a role like this before, but I think he did a great job. Jamie Foxx was also very good in what is the biggest part in the movie (supporting actor? I think not). Max goes from nervous taxi driver to hero and I think that the transformation is quite believable, thanks to the script of course, but also thanks to Foxx's great performance.So, Collateral is a great action thriller with fine performances. Highly recommended. (8/10)",8,0,0,20 March 2005
Aliens," The best sci-fi/action movie ever
","This is one of the movies I have seen so many times that I know it by heart. I never stop being almost hypnotized by the darkness and suspense this movie evokes when I watch it. Normally, I don't like action films, but James Cameron certainly is a wizard when it comes to movies like this (me being a huge fan of Terminator and [in particular] Terminator 2, as well).Sigourney Weaver is fantastic, as is Michael Biehn, in this intense movie -- the best sci-fi/action movie ever (together with Terminator 2)!I'd give it 10/10.",10,0,0,28 March 1999
The Exorcist," Scary on a psychological level
","I have seen this movie two times. The first time six years ago when I was sixteen years old. I had nightmares for a week. I had only heard that it was scary and didn't know anything else about it (being Swedish, I of course knew that Max von Sydow had a part in it), so it *did* scare me. It isn't scary in the special effects 'body-parts are flying'-kind of way or anything, it's scary on a psychological level which is a thing I don't think people who say that this isn't a scary movie can see. They obviously wants more blood and maimed bodies. This is horror with *class*. More of a Silence of the Lambs-'scariness'.However, I have now seen it a second time and I have to say that I don't find it as scary as I did when I was sixteen. But it is still a great movie and didn't William Peter Blatty say that he based his book on an article he had read as a student about an exorcism that the Catholic church *had* allowed for a young boy. I don't know if that's true, but if the Catholic church allows an exorcism then it must be... serious.Great and intense movie. I give it 7/10.",7,1,1,3 April 1999
American History X," An Important Movie
","'American History X' is without a doubt one of the best and most important movies I have seen the last year. It is thought provoking, superbly written, superbly directed, and not to mention the brilliant acting by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Some scenes are very shocking, but they need to be there. Having seen this movie another neo-Nazi movie immediately springs to mind: the Australian 'Romper Stomper' (1992). I think that 'American History X' is the best of the two since it is more analyzing and less violent, and the acting is much better (not to say that the cast of 'Romper Stomper' is bad though). Norton is without a doubt the best actor right now, and Furlong is certainly almost as good.",8,0,0,18 March 1999
American History X," Norton is brilliant
","Tonight I saw 'American History X' for the second time at the movie theater. I have been looking forward to it since I last saw AHX in March this year (this is also my second comment on AHX). Well, so what did I think the second time? I have thought about AHX a lot since I saw it last, and it lived up to my memories of it. AHX is without a doubt one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. The experience of watching this film completely drains me, I get very emotionally involved in what happens to the Vinyard  family (Derek and Danny in particular, of course). I could go on and on about how brilliant this film, but I will try to keep it short; I have nothing bad to say about this film, some of the flaws that other people has brought up here at IMDb is too small for me to care about, I'm aware of a few of these flaws but as the film is so powerful and brilliant I just don't care about that. A movie is not only about what is there in the script, it's about what you feel when you watch it, and AHX will definitely make you feel something. Edward Furlong is very good in this film, it's probably his best performance ever, I do believe that he's even better than he was in 'American Heart'.Edward Norton is absolutely brilliant! His performance as Derek Vinyard is awe-inspiring, how he did not win the Oscar he was nominated for is beyond me. Not only is his performance awe-inspiring, it's almost surreal as well, because how could anyone be that good? Edward Norton is one of the reasons to watch this film. Even if the premise does not seem interesting to you I think you should see AHX anyway because Norton's performance will blow you away.(10/10)",8,0,0,7 November 1999
Ocean's Eleven," Let Soderbergh entertain you
","If you want entertainment -- here's where you'll find it! I've never been much of a heist flick fan -- Ocean's Eleven, though, I like. In fact, I like it a lot. The cast is great. Clooney, Pitt, Cheadle, and Damon are all quite brilliant, but so is the rest of the cast as well. Soderbergh seems incapable of making a bad or uninteresting movie. I look forward to his next film!

The Usual Suspects," Great
","I have to agree with most of the people who's commented on 'The Usual Suspects' at IMDb; this film is great. *And* it's even better the second time. The actors are incredibly good, Kevin Spacey is one of my favourite actors and he can never do anything wrong when it comes to acting.But the big question after you've seen this movie is of course: What did really happen? I mean, when we know who Keyser Söze is, that is: the only one who really knows what has happened, the one who 'tells' the movie, we don't know if *anything* in the movie has really happened. It's very fascinating, but in a way rather annoying as well. Well, a good kind of annoying as this is a great film. :-)If you haven't seen this movie: see it! If you've seen this movie only once: see it again!",Null,0,1,24 August 1999
Alien vs. Predator," Better than expected
","So, I didn't expect much from this movie. I haven't seen any of the Predator movies, but I have seen all Alien movies (and think that James Cameron's Aliens is probably the best film ever made). It turns out that AvP was better than expected. Which doesn't say a lot, but still.I quite enjoyed the first hour or so of AvP. It was seldom suspenseful, but quite entertaining anyway. I liked how every single character was killed, one by one. However, once Alexa Woods started interacting with the predator it all got a bit too silly for my taste. In fact, I couldn't shake the image of Alexa and the predator getting hitched in Las Vegas. A rather amusing image, to say the least, but hardly, and hopefully not, what the director/writer had intended.So, up until the last half hour or so, AvP was quite a good film, but it got too silly in the end. AvP ends up being an okay film. (5/10)",5,0,0,4 March 2005
Legends of the Fall," Well, there is *one* good thing about this film...
","What good things do I have to say about 'Legends of the Fall'? Let's see Let me think. Ah! Great cinematography! Well, sorry, that's about it, because apart from the cinematography everything in this film (apart from Henry Thomas and maybe Brad Pitt) is bad. The script, the direction, the acting It's like a TV soap that goes on forever, and it is *so* predictable. We pretty much know where the film is going when we see Julia Ormond for the first time. Now, this isn't something that I like to say. I really wanted to like this film as my favourite film of all time ('Glory') is directed by this film's director (Edward Zwick). To know that the same man who made the masterpiece 'Glory' made this film is almost physically painful.Well, like I said; great cinematography, Henry Thomas does a good job and I must say that Brad Pitt is doing fine. That means that this film is not total trash, and I have not yet decided whether I will give this film a 3 or a 4 out of 10. I think I have to see it again to be sure (even though  I certainly want to avoid that as long as possible).",3,3,7,13 October 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Well-made and interesting, but *far* from a masterpiece
","'Saving Private Ryan' has several very intense and touching scenes. The first half hour is, for instance, a movie classic already. However, having not seen this movie on the big screen I guess I don't look upon these thirty minutes the way many other people do. For me they are only intense -- like so many scenes in so many films.On the whole, 'Saving Private Ryan' is far from a masterpiece. It is very well-made and rather interesting, but not much more. I still enjoyed it though, even if I think 'Glory' and a few other films are much better war movies.And as for the Academy Awards this year, I consider it to be a scandal that 'Shakespeare in Love' won the Best Picture award, SPR is at least somewhat better than that film, it's just as strange as the fact that Edward Norton didn't win the Best Actor award.So, this film is far from a masterpiece, but I still appreciate the fact that SPR is well-made and interesting.",6,0,0,9 July 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful film
","[I comment the ending in this review and some people might consider it to be a SPOILER]Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon did not live up to my expectations, but then my expectations were higher than usual and that was perhaps unfair to the film. Don't get me wrong; CTHD is a good film, but not the masterpiece I thought I was going to see at the cinema today. But the film is beautiful: great cinematography, fantastic choreographed fight scenes, stunning scenery, and a brilliant score. I have to say that for me the high point of the film was the desert romance, it was romantic and rather amusing as well, and who wouldn't fall in love with a man like Lo (Chen Chang), I wonder? Funny, charming, handsome Well, anyway, it's a great love story. I also think the ending is perfect, sad but beautiful. Not Ang Lee's best, but he's certainly an accomplished director.

Moulin Rouge!," Crazy/Beautiful
","I usually don't like musicals. I've never liked the fact that people start to sing when I least expect it (and least want them to). I guess I like Moulin Rouge since it's so crazy that the singing doesn't seem as unnatural as in other films.Moulin Rouge is first and foremost a feast for the eyes. The production design is spectacular as is the costume design. The visual effects are brilliant. It's colourful and dazzling. It feels original. The premise of the movie is not original at all, a classic story of doomed love. For once, though, I didn't think about the fact that the premise is so archetypical, I was too busy watching the screen.Both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, as well as most of the supporting players, are brilliant. Moulin Rouge is a crazy and beautiful film. (7/10)",7,0,1,10 November 2001
Pi," Didn't like it
","This must be one of the strangest films I have ever seen, and let me tell you right now: I didn't appreciate it. I found that for me the story wasn't in focus, rather the editing, close-ups, camera angles and the claustrophobic score. I just couldn't concentrate on what was going on, I was just thinking 'What an angle!' and things like that all the time. No, this film was *not* for me, I didn't like it at all although I must say the story seemed interesting when I read about it. (2/10)",2,2,5,28 April 2000
The Football Factory," Good movie
","The Football Factory is movie about football (soccer) fans. Since they seem to be more interested in fighting than in actually watching the games this is certainly no sports film so don't let the title fool you. It's also based upon a novel that I haven't even heard of, but that could perhaps be because I'm in Sweden.The Football Factory is a very episodic movie. Mostly it works, but sometimes I felt like I wanted to spend more time with main character Tommy Johnson or that they should at least had focused on fewer characters. Sometimes I felt that a scene was working really well, but the story quickly focused on other things. As I said, more often than not the episodic feel works fine, but not all the time.As in almost all English movies the acting's great. From minor characters to main characters... they feel real. I especially think the voice over sounds very authentic: it's Tommy speaking, not actor Danny Dryer reading.I think this is a good movie, it's rather violent and upsetting at times, but also funny and entertaining.",6,39,55,29 January 2005
Donnie Brasco," Interesting movie that should have been longer
","What I remember most from this film (well, I saw it just yesterday, but...) is the superb performance from Al Pacino as Lefty. And Johnny Depp was also great.The film itself is a very interesting and well-made 'gangster' movie, based upon a true story. It is engrossing and I wanted it to be perhaps a half hour longer -- it had a storyline that was so interesting that it could easily have been longer without me getting bored. Usually, I think the movies should be a half hour shorter. So, really good and well-made film by director Mike Newell.",8,0,1,10 June 1999
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Disjointed and boring
","I quite liked the first RE-movie (6/10). I also enjoyed playing Resident Evil 3 upon which this movie seems to be very loosely based. So, while I didn't expect very much (because of the reviews) I still expected to be at least somewhat entertained for 90 minutes. Problem is: I wasn't entertained for 90 minutes. I wasn't entertained at all.The main problem with the movie is that there are no characters. Sure, there are people in the movie, but we don't get to know them. They're just there, running about, shooting zombies, acting cool. I couldn't care less about what happened to these mannequins. Another problem is the disjointed narrative. It takes way to long to get the main 'characters' together, and before they manage to do that the movie is very boring. This is because, as I said, it feels disjointed and episodic. Yet another problem is the acting. Most of these people couldn't act to save their lives.It's probably unfair to compare it to other recent zombie flicks such as 28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead and the remake of Dawn of the Dead. All of these movies I like a lot. But they're not only action movies, they are as much dramas or comedies with a bit of horror in the mix. I guess the only movie I can fairly compare RE: Apocalypse to is the first RE movie. The comparison is sure to be unfavourable. As mentioned, I actually liked that movie.RE: Apocalypse is sadly a disjointed and boring mess. (2/10)",2,1,4,11 March 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Surprisingly good
","This is one of those films that I have decided I will never pay too see, because I didn't think it would be worth spending money on. Well, look how wrong I was!! I decided to watch it tonight since it was on tv and I'm glad I did. Now, this film is very far from a masterpiece, but I liked it anyway. I thought it was funny and very entertaining. I've never been impressed by or scared by or interested in splatter effects -- they always make me laugh in more serious horror films, but since this film is a comedy more than anything else I was supposed to laugh at the flying body parts so I thought it was okay. Human guitar, anyone? :-)Well, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a very entertaining film -- if you have the same sense of humour as me, because I have to warn you: this is *not* a film for everyone.

Luckily, I got a second chance now when it is out on video. Michael Mann's  'Heat' is a great action film, this film is certainly nothing like it. Well, apart from the Â‘great' thing, because 'The Insider' is a great film. Of course, like most films it should have been made shorter, 2.5 hours is just too long. But good direction, an interesting script and great acting (read: Russell Crowe!!) makes up for the film's length. Great movie! (7/10)",7,0,0,3 November 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Great acting
","The problem with 'Girl, Interrupted' is that the main character Susanna (Winona Ryder) is rather boring. Actually, there are only two really interesting characters in the film: Angelina Jolie's sociopath and the girl played by Brittany Murphy. But even though Susanna is pretty boring, the film isn't. I think it's a rather interesting and entertaining film. Of course, it's too long (over two hours) and in the beginning it's too episodic, but overall I think it's an okay film. And brilliant acting by Ryder, Jolie (in particular) and Murphy, of course. (5/10)",5,1,2,24 September 2000
Toy Story 2," Entertaining
","I thought that 'Toy Story 2' was very entertaining and funny. I haven't seen the first one yet, but I noticed that that wasn't really needed to enjoy the sequel. What I also liked was the more serious aspects of the film; the importance of being loved, of being shown love. The only thing I didn't like was the girl cowboy, Jesse?, since she seemed to be screaming on the top of her lungs all the time. But, like I said: it's thoroughly entertaining and I recommend it to both children and adults.",6,0,1,9 March 2000
Life Is Beautiful," This movie 'è bella'
","This movie is great. When I walked out of the cinema I was filled with happiness. Roberto Benigni has made a beautiful, funny, charming, entertaining, sad, and heartbreaking movie about a father who'll overlook his own sorrow and fear to save his son from the knowledge that they are most likely going to be killed. The movie starts off as pure comedy, but after an hour or so it has developed to the most amazing mix of comedy and drama that I have ever seen. Sometimes I didn't know if I should laugh or cry, so I did both -- at once.So, life *is* beautiful -- as is this film!",8,1,2,8 April 1999
The Hurricane," Brilliant Denzel
","What is so odd about this film is that it is not as engaging as it should be considering it's based upon a true story. The film doesn't get *really* interesting until the last 40 minutes or so. It is certainly not Denzel Washington's fault, though. He is one of the finest actors ever to bless the big screen with his presence and he certainly deserved the Oscar nod this year. But the film... Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but it wasn't very gripping given what it is about. (6/10)",6,0,3,15 October 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Best Tarantino-film
","Reservoir Dogs is easily the best film Quentin Tarantino has directed. Much better than Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. RD is funny, entertaining, intelligent and actually not so violent as some people say. Sure, lots of blood, but not so much violence, according to me.The acting... Steve Buscemi has never been better, Harvey Keitel is great, but the stand-out in this great cast is Tim Roth. He's brilliant. Great flick. (8/10)",8,4,7,11 December 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A good adaptation of Rowling's novel
","It certainly wasn't an easy task Chris Columbus took upon himself when he started working on adapting one of the most loved novels ever for the screen. I have to say that I was among those who felt almost upset when I heard that Columbus would direct the movie -- Home Alone, need I say more? I was doubtful if Columbus would be capable to go to darker places. I am happy to say that Columbus has stayed true to the source material in most ways. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a rather dark movie considering that it is a children's film. Luckily, there are some comic scenes as well -- though not nearly as many as in the book.The acting from the adult actors is brilliant -- as was only expected with such a cast! Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and my personal 'favourite' Ian Hart (who doesn't have enough screen time, if you ask me) are all great. The child actors is another matter... Daniel Radcliffe has to look surprised, awed and scared all the time. It's kind of boring. I'm sure he will do better in the next movie when -- hopefully -- his eyebrows won't be at the edge of his scalp all the time. The best of the younger actors is without a doubt Rupert Grint who plays Ron. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is also good.There are certain aspects of the film that are absolutely brilliant. Cinematography, production design, costume design et cetera. Hogwarts, for example, looked almost exactly as I had imagined it.Harry Potter is a good movie. It's not great, but even if I am somewhat disappointed I still feel that there couldn't have been a better adaptation of the novel (well, perhaps Terry Gilliam could have done something brilliant with the source material). However, images can never replace Rowling's language and style. Believe me, the best H.P.-movie you will ever see is the one you see in your mind when you read the novel.Still, it is a job well done by Columbus and screenwriter Steven Kloves and everyone else who worked on the film.

It's a Wonderful Life," It's a wonderful film
","So, I was finally able to watch this classic. Haven't been able to find it on video anywhere (not even at the library!) but just a couple of weeks ago a Swedish TV channel aired it and I taped it mainly because I have almost heard as much about this film as 'Casablanca' and other classics. Also, I really like James Stewart and always appreciate him in a film.'It's a Wonderful Life' is certainly a wonderful film! It's cleverly made and the acting is brilliant. A pure joy to watch. However, it is no masterpiece according to me because the ending is just too much, the film would have been perfect if they hadn't added so much sugar in the end. Also, I do feel that despite the fact that Stewart's character should find joy in his friends, that he does have the right to feel somewhat disappointed about his life. I mean, he has the right to wish that his dreams could come true. I hope I don't sound too cynical, but the thing about 'everything is wonderful as long as you have friends' is kind of true, but not the truth, why couldn't he have friends *and* a nice career? Oh well... A brilliant film nevertheless. (8/10)",8,1,6,20 August 2000
Scream 2," Better than 'Scream'
","[This comment contains SPOILERS.]Well, as my summary clearly states, I'm one of those people who actually prefer the second Scream to the first. I believe that 'Scream 2' is scarier, funnier and more interesting than the first one. I really like them both, because the two Screams are the only films that actually makes me jump (=better than Halloween and Friday the 13th). Now, there is one major flaw in the second Scream. The ENDING! My God, that was the most contrived ending I have ever had to endure (almost). I just moaned when I saw the film at the cinema the first time. But, as I said, I prefer it to 'Scream' and it is definitely the best slasher horror film that I have ever seen.Oh, and David Arquette/Dewey is absolutely adorable!",7,0,0,13 November 1999
The Green Mile," Touching and engrossing film
","'The Shawshank Redemption' by Frank Darabont is one of my favourite films, but for some reason I didn't think that I would like 'The Green Mile'. Consequently, I didn't see it at the cinema (and basically, I try to avoid watching films that are over 2,5 hours long at the cinema -- I'd rather see them at home sitting comfortably in my sofa).Is 'The Green Mile' as good as 'The Shawshank Redemption'? I have to say no. However, I really liked this film. It was very touching and engrossing, it didn't feel almost three hours long. Tom Hanks gave a nice performance. Michael Clarke Duncan was quite brilliant, very much worthy of the Oscar nod this year. The main problem, though, is the fact that the film *is* three hours long. According to me, there were several scenes in the film that were unnecessary, for instance, they could have left out the opening and closing scenes since they made the story kind of ridiculous. Overall, though, 'The Green Mile' was an engrossing movie experience (it's been a long time since I cried so much during a film), the acting was great, but sadly a few scenes were superfluous.

Halloween," Not scary
","I'm getting quite desperate here. I love being scared, but the last few years I haven't seen a single movie that has actually scared me. Sure, some films really make me feel uneasy, e.g. 'The Exorcist', 'The Shining', 'Seven', and 'The Hills Have Eyes', but they do not scare me. At least not anymore. 'Halloween' also fails to scare me. Sure, it has some shocking surprise scenes, but as I remember it there are only two or maybe three of those. And the whole film really doesn't get interesting until after an hour, so only the last 30 minutes or so are really intense. 'Halloween' is of course much better than most of the horror films that were made in the late 70s and early 80s. It is better than 'Terror Train' for instance, and it is better than the only other sequel to 'Halloween' that I have seen; 'Halloween H20'. But unfortunately, that does not say much. The music to 'Halloween' is brilliant, though. Absolutely brilliant.",Null,1,2,7 November 1999
Carrie," Great direction by De Palma
","[This comment contains SPOILERS.]I have seen 'Carrie' two times. The last time was just the other night, the first time was when I was very young, probably around ten or eleven years old. As those of you who have seen this film can imagine, I was scared half to death watching 'Carrie' the first time. The scene where the mother gets crucified was very disturbing to me back then. Well, that was ten years ago and I must say that the film did not scare me this time. I still find it rather unsettling, but not scary.However, the film is great!! It may seem contradictory to say that a horror film that didn't scare me is great, but it's not [contradictory]. Brian De Palma has put the film together in such a brilliant way that everyone, whether they are scared or not, must admit that it's a good film. The editing (great use of split screens), the acting, the weird camera angles (e.g. when Carrie and Tom are dancing), the music, the script
I really liked this film, and one thing *did* actually make me jump: the final scene involving Sue and an arm that looks uncannily like Carrie's... I give this film 7/10. Yet, I can't stop thinking about how great this film would have been if it had ignored the horror in Stephen King's novel and skipped the bloodbath at the end and written another ending. I know that seems contradictory as well, but I really think that De Palma handled the bullying, the pain Carrie feels, and her problems with her mum in a brilliant way. The horror didn't have to be there at all, as the story is so strong in itself. Just a thought.",7,0,0,27 October 1999
Sweet and Lowdown," Good film, great acting
","'Sweet and Lowdown' is an Allen-film that I have really looked forward to, so when it finally came to my local cinema I just had to see it. The film is good, but it is certainly not a masterpiece. I really don't understand what the faux documentary scenes were there for. According to me they added nothing to the story while they made the experience of watching the film kind of irritating. The acting, though, is absolutely brilliant. Sean Penn and Samantha Morton are fantastic! Not the best Allen-film I have seen, that's 'Bullets over Broadway', but still a good film. (6/10)",6,0,0,1 November 2000
The Deer Hunter," Walken is brilliant
","This movie contains some of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen. Although this movie does not concentrate on the war as much as e.g. Saving Private Ryan, I must say that the scenes from Vietnam in this film, the psychological as well as the physical torture, is much more disturbing and awful to me than the whole first half hour of SPR. Very powerful. Robert De Niro is as good as ever, but I have to say that Christopher Walken is the one who impresses me the most. He is absolutely brilliant and managed to really show how Nick (his character in the film) becomes self-destructive in the saddest way. Magnificent!",7,5,8,18 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," Good film -- nothing more
","I really wanted to love this film, I have waited for it to open in Sweden for so long. Unfortunately, I did not love it. I came pretty close to not even liking it, but well, in the end I did like it. Last night I saw 'Fight Club' at the cinema, I hadn't expected very much, but I walked out of the cinema thrilled and enthusiastic and 'wowed'. I walked out, after having seen 'The Sixth Sense', thinking about all the plot inconsistencies. I tried to overlook them and say: 'Look Anna, you're too stupid to realise that those ten or fifteen plot inconsistencies do not exist. Surely, there are a 'logic' explanation for everything.' I failed. But as I said, I *did* like it and I was quite spooked at times, but after having seen Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and David Fincher (well, I didn't actually see *him*) in action the night before I just don't think I was ready to accept 'The Sixth Sense' as a great movie experience. I *should* love this film, and I know that I probably would have if it wasn't for a) the boring first 45 minutes and b) the fact that I knew there was a twist. I think that if the ending had come as a *real* surprise, like 'oh-my-god-is-there-a-twist-in-this-film?!' I would have appreciated it much more. Now I spent half of the movie looking for clues to the twist (I didn't know *what* the twist was, though).Well, the film is good and Haley Joel Osment is fantastic -- a child actor that would actually deserve a Golden Globe or an Oscar (unlike Anna Paquin). And Bruce Willis was good as well! Okay, he's not Kevin Spacey or Edward Norton, and he never will be, but he actually did a great job in this film. I'm surprised. Well, I give this film a 6 out of 10, although I thought a lot about giving it a 5. A huge disappointment -- but still a good film.",6,0,0,7 January 2000
Final Destination," Original horror movie
","Final Destination is original for being a horror film. Of course, like always, horrified is probably the last thing I feel watching horror films, but Final Destination is genuinely entertaining, it includes one or two original thoughts (which rarely happens in this genre), and I actually jumped once so I guess it's a good film. The acting... most of the cast were neither good nor bad while Devon Sawa was _good_ in the lead role. (5/10)",6,2,3,9 December 2000
Rear Window," Thank you, Hitchcock!
","What else is there to say but: 'Thank you, Hitchcock!' Even though I've seen the most famous Hitchcock films when I was a teenager (e.g. The Birds and Psycho) I haven't actively been looking for Hitchcock films in the video store or the library until now. And you know, it feels like I've stumbled upon a treasure. To know that I haven't even seen half of Hitchcock's films is a source of happiness. To know that I have so many good films to look forward to Well, everyone who is a Hitchcock-fan knows what I mean.'Rear Window' is one of the best Hitchcock films I have seen. I like James Stewart and I think he's brilliant here. Grace Kelly is very good as well and the whole film is, of course, masterfully made. A pure joy to watch and experience, I can recommend 'Rear Window' to everyone. I still think that 'Strangers on a Train' is the best Hitchcock I have seen but then again, I have so many Hitchcock films yet to see",8,1,3,16 February 2000
The Matrix," Cool enough for a thousand films
","First of all, I firmly believe that 'The Matrix' is a movie that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated. I have only seen it once, on July 14.Having said that, though, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching 'The Matrix'. The special effects are superb and the production design is great. I even enjoyed the fight scenes and the shoot-outs which I normally think are just a waste of time. The movie is almost unbearably cool. And the scene in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) comes walking with a black trench coat, shades, and enough guns for an entire platoon, is so cool that it almost hurts to see it. And the shoot-out following that. Wow!Some people complain about the story, I say that the story is fascinating and interesting. Sure, there are some holes in it, but overall it's good. However, the first 45 to 60 minutes are, I'm sorry to say, mediocre and not good at all. I was, at times, bored during that first hour.The acting is, well... not that good. Keanu Reeves has never been a convincing actor, but for being Keanu, though, he does a good job. Laurence Fishburne is the only actor in the movie that is really convincing.It must also be said that 'The Matrix' is certainly not a movie suited for the 'small screen'. If you think you want to see 'The Matrix' I think you should rush to the nearest cinema immediately as you will not appreciate it fully renting it on video, or DVD for that matter.In short: fascinating story, great special effects, and great fight and shoot-out scenes. I would give this movie a 7 or 8 out of 10. Too bad about the mediocre beginning. But one thing is for sure (and this might be a spoiler so if you haven't seen the movie don't read the rest), considering where the movie ends I look forward to the sequel(s) already.",8,0,0,15 July 1999
Casino," Not as good as 'Goodfellas'
","'Casino' is a good movie about... well, a casino in Las Vegas. However, it's far from as good as 'Goodfellas' and it did go on for at least half an hour too long. What's best about this film is the acting. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone are all great. Other from that I must say that I have seen movies like this one too many times to be really impressed. (6/10)",6,2,5,16 April 1999
Heat," Quite brilliant
","My main reason for watching 'Heat' when it was on TV tonight was to see if it was as good as I remember I thought it was when I saw it at the cinema in 1996. I was awed when I walked out of the theater that day, but I haven't seen it since so I was kind of curious. And hey, even if the film is only half as good as I thought it was back then, it's a film I want to watch again!So, yes I can say that 'Heat' is almost as good as I thought it was the first time I saw it. It's a fantastic mix of thriller, action, and drama and the acting is top notch... Well; De Niro, Pacino... it's *better* than top notch. My main complaint, though, is that it is sadly too long. Had it been shorter I would have enjoyed it so much more, but it is still a quite brilliant film, very entertaining. (7/10)",7,0,0,6 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Good film even though it doesn't live up to all the hype
","I know that there are few movies out there which are as much loved as 'Star Wars'. So, I think I should say this straight away; I do *not* think that this film deserves all the praise and all the hype it's gotten over the last 22 years. However, I do like this film, it's just that it is so full of clichés that one more cliché would've made it a very silly film. As it is now, it's not silly, it's a good film for kids. I don't say that to try to put the film down, there's nothing wrong with children's films. Look at the best Disney films for example! Some of them are masterpieces. And I really like fantasy films like 'Star Wars' even if I think that e.g. 'Time Bandits' is a better film. Having said that, there is nothing really wrong with 'Star Wars', it's good entertainment. It's rather funny (I like interplay between R2-D2 and C-3PO) and apart from the clichés (though they are overwhelming) it is a rather nice story -- for kids. Not being a child I do demand much more from a film's script than this, but I was still very entertained while I watched 'Star Wars' and my vote for it here at IMDb was a 6 (out of 10).",7,4,12,27 October 1999
Cube," Fascinating
","'Fascinating' is probably the most correct word to describe this film. What it lacks in setting and in special effects it gains in an imaginative plot. And yet, the plot is probably the most simple I've heard of for many years. Five or six people are trapped in a room and have to get out, only there are traps that will kill you and the next room looks exactly the same as the one before apart from a different colour. Like a labyrinth. Like I said, do not expect any fascinating special effects or some nice settings or some great cinematography or (for that matter) some great acting or, coming to think about it, an elaborate plot. Just watch this for the *simple* plot that is very fascinating and if you don't expect too much I think you'll enjoy it. [Plot SPOILER revealed below.] I have to say, though, that the 'psycho-boy' ending was a bit of a cop out, is this the ending we wanted? Don't think so. Perhaps the screenwriters' imagination ran out just there, which is a shame really.6/10",6,0,1,22 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Better than 'Star Wars'
","I just have one thing to say: What an improvement from 'Star Wars'!! A word of advice to George Lucas; he should stay away from writing scripts and directing movies. Obviously, there are other people who can realize his ideas much better than the man himself. Other than that, you can read my comment on 'Star Wars' because apart from this one being better than the first film I feel pretty much the same thing about the two films.",7,1,10,20 November 1999
Braveheart," Absolutely brilliant
","I have seen 'Braveheart' a few times now, and it only gets better and better with each viewing. However, I have *always* thought that this is a brilliant film. The battle scenes are spectacular, the love story sweet, and the script -- generally -- is great, the film doesn't have any weak moments although it goes on for nearly three hours. Mel Gibson has truly accomplished great things with this film. I simply love it! And James Horner's score is nice (although the scores for 'Titanic' and, in particular, 'Glory' are better). Well, there's really nothing else to say about it, except if you haven't seen it yet: what are you waiting for?! (9/10)",9,4,7,15 April 2000
Gladiator," Brilliant acting
","I expected much before I saw this film and as every film fan knows; you should never expect things before you see a film. So, I didn't like 'Gladiator' as much as I thought I would, but I still think it's a good film. It's interesting, the action scenes are great (the opening battle scene is reminiscent of both 'Braveheart' and 'Saving Private Ryan'), the drama quite interesting, and the acting brilliant. Of course, Russell Crowe has never been better (I haven't seen 'The Insider yet, though), and we all know how good he was in e.g. 'L.A. Confidential.' Joaquin Phoenix doesn't play a very likable character, Commodus is a pathetic loser, but he does a good job with it anyway. Recommended. (7/10)",7,0,0,7 June 2000
The Wedding Singer," Delightful

The Bourne Supremacy," Better than The Bourne Identity
","I don't know why I rented this movie. I didn't like the first movie, The Bourne Identity, at all (voted 4 out of 10 here at IMDb). So why I would want to pay to watch a sequel to a movie I didn't even like is difficult to explain.Well, I did rent The Bourne Supremacy and I'm quite happy that I did. This sequel is much better than the first film. While BI was boring most of the time, BS is exciting and engaging. It was also a bit grittier than expected. This time I really want another Bourne-film.I didn't care for the car chases though. I normally don't find any entertainment value in car chases and this movie is no exception. Too bad then, that it has at least two lengthy car chase scenes (one of them must be close to five minutes long). These scenes were just a waste of time according to me. Also, the movie would have benefited from being about 15 minutes shorter.I love the last scene in Russia, though. Bourne talks to the daughter of a couple he has murdered and confesses the murder. It's a very touching scene and for the first time in the movie, Bourne actually seems human. That's one of the reasons why I want another Bourne movie. From here, things should get even better...(7/10)",7,5,10,26 February 2005
Dodgeball," Entertaining
","I've been looking forward to watching this movie for quite a long time. Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller are almost always great and the trailer was hysterical. As is almost always the case, though, the trailer had already shown the funny scenes so there were hardly any surprises watching the film.However, you're not supposed to be surprised watching a movie called Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. You pretty much know what's going to happen when you've read the title. I didn't mind much though, because even though the trailer had shown almost all the funny scenes, those scenes were _really_ funny. Also, Dodgeball is constantly entertaining and never boring. I quite liked it.(6/10)",6,0,0,14 January 2005
High Fidelity," Funny and interesting
","I read Nick Hornby's novel High Fidelity a few years ago and I loved it, so when I rented this film I couldn't help but wondering how on earth anyone could turn that novel into a film. It couldn't have been an easy task. The solution, as is seen in the movie, was to turn the novel into a narration where John Cusack is looking straight into the camera a lot of time. I believe this was a very brave step, and with any other actor than the brilliant Cusack playing Rob, it wouldn't have worked.They've also managed to get a great cast together: John Cusack, Jack Black, Iben Hjejle, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack (no surprise to anyone who've watched a few John Cusack-films) and Lili Taylor. Brilliant cast. High Fidelity is also funny, sweet, and engaging. Recommended.",6,1,3,17 February 2001
