The Blair Witch Project," Tapped In
","It's not often a film has tapped into my imagination as BWP did. Everything that happened to the three youths could be explained away logically but yet again could it ?  I was left deep in an awful wonder and it was a great feeling.  There was no conclusion and I was happy with that. I advise people who are yet to see it to watch and listen right from the beginning.  I know people who have not LISTENED to the townsfolk at the start of the film and therefore the ending, and what an ending, is completely lost on them. Watch it, live it, feel it, identify with it.",10,1,2,10 November 1999
