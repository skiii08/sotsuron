Your Name.," Impressive and entertaining
","I am not an anime or animation in general fan or expert, but I was quite impressed by this Bluray. It is a work of art and the palate, story, humanity of it were really impressive.I was also impressed by how much freer and more progressive Japan is. The breasts, legs and shot skirts are so pretty and cute. I think I fell in love with the main girl and the lady co-worker who takes off her skirt.Why am I giving this an 8 I should really move up to 9",8,5,6,5 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Oh Oh!!
","The descendants of of Skywalker are coming to earthThey are taking legal action if they are in a good mood and they will begin aerial bombing if they are in a bad mood. This film, writer and director has slandered their name and dragged it through the mud.Should they read this: please target Hollywood, LucasFilm, Disney and Bad Robot only. Those are the dens of the sith who are dragging the name of the force, jedi and integrity through the mud. The rest of us are blameless. OK fine those 10/10 reviewers (Bad Robot contractrors) can also go.",2,12,18,6 January 2020
