Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not entirely disappointing
","I had heard such scathing criticism of ST:TPM that I went into the theater with dramatically lowered expectations.  As a result, aspects of the movie that were well done appeared to be moments of genius; parts that were merely not disappointing exceeded my expectations, and the abysmal crap was no more than I had anticipated.  I therefore feel that I can offer some objective criticism.THE GOOD:The costume designer deserves an Academy Award, and will probably get one. Exquisite work.They don't give Oscars for Spacecraft Design, but the responsible party ought to get one anyway.  They took care to contrast the graceful lines of the Queen's ship with the stark, utilitarian lines of the Empire ships in Eps. 4-6.  Beautiful work.Stunning visuals.  The Gungan city was astonishing.  Trantor -- oops, I mean Coruscant --  was everything it should have been. The Naboo capital was gorgeous.The actors.  I know that the performances were criticized negatively by some, but I thought the parts were played quite competently given the conditions.  It is very difficult to look convincing playing against another character that isn't really there, against a set that mostly isn't there either, and with such badly written lines.The aliens.  Although I dislike CG actors on principle, I have to admit that they were well done.  The state of the art has come a long way since TIN TOY.The fights.  The best choreographed fight sequences in any Star Wars movie, and near the top of the heap in general.The music.  How can you go wrong with John Williams?THE BAD:I'll start with the biggie:  the script.  George Lucas flubbed it big time. Would it really have been that much trouble to write a second draft? There were few original lines - most of them seem to have been cribbed from dozens of other movies in various genres, and one could almost recite them along with the actors even before the first hearing.  There was no discernable plot.  The drawing together of the various subplots and the careful orchestration of dramatic tension into a single exultant climax, so competently rendered in the original Star Wars, is absent.  Instead:  a lot happens, and rather breathlessly at that.One of the most annoying kinks in the script is the 'little kid saves the day' motif.  This motif, overused by Star Trek: The Next Generation in the person of Wesley Crusher, made Wesley the most hated character in the series for devoted fans around the globe.  Fortunately for Anakin, we have Jar-Jar Binks to draw off our rancor - and here I may have discovered the true purpose of that character.  A little of him goes a long way, and while he's amusing enough, he's nowhere near as amusing as Lucas seems to think.The Details:  There were some sloppy moments.  I won't detail them all, but they were evident to anyone paying attention, mostly related to continuity and props.The CG:  As I said earlier, I'm opposed to it on principle.  But some of it could have been better done with a little more effort.  Jar-Jar's pratfalls seemed to occur on a planet with about three times the gravity as the planet everyone else was on.  Boss Nass' spittle flew out in exactly the same pattern every time he shook his jowls - an obvious corner cut. There were other examples of this sort of thing.Racial Sterotypes.  The obviously Asian-looking (and sounding) Federation representatives, often speaking lines that could have come out of Japanese characters in a WWII movie.  The somewhat Chicano-looking Sebulba.  The Rasta Gungans.  There may have been others I missed.  And I'm not even going to talk about the religious caricatures.Midchlorians:  Oh, give me a break!On balance, worth the price of admission - I saw it at a matinee.  But certainly not the work of genius it had been promoted to be, or that the fans expected.",7,0,0,15 June 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Now that's more like it.
","The summary above relates to Lord of the Rings, The (1978) which I detested. Peter Jackson did a superb job bringing Tolkien's Middle-earth to the screen. However, I think it's current high rating is seriously premature. This movie cannot stand on its own. Like the book, it's a single continuous narrative split into three parts for reasons of length. Any ending such as it has will not be seen until Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The (2003) arrives in theaters. Right now it's a work-in-progress. Evaluating it should wait until the entire story is finished.No one who has been a devotee of the book as long as I have can resist comparing the movie against it even though that's not really a valid thing to do across media. So here it goes below. There are POSSIBLE SPOILERS, although they're so highly contextual you probably won't understand them unless you've already seen the movie, so they shouldn't give away much. I don't think I give away any major plot points.What was done right:<ul><li>Rivendell was beatuiful. I used to want a castle someday; now I want the 'Last Homely House' as Jackson showed it to me.</li></ul><ul><li>Bree was very well done. Many probably disagree with me about this, but if there wasn't enough time to develop Butterbur as a character, Bree is best shown as a rough-and-tumble waymeet along a road traveled by a large number of highly questionable characters. This is very much like any place so situated would be.</li></ul><ul><li>Hobbiton. Gorgeous.</li></ul><ul><li>Casting, for the most part. An exception is noted below. Frodo really should have had brown eyes, but Elijah Wood did a *far* better job than I had anticipated, so it didn't matter.</li></ul><ul><li>The Council of Elrond. Impossible to shoot as the book has it, but it provided a stark demonstration of the Ring's true power. A highly skillful adaptation.</li></ul><ul><li>The Mirror of Galadriel. Perhaps the sfx were overdone at a crucial moment, but at least the deep moral import of her choice was preserved and that was the important thing. Hollywood usually glosses over moral issues, or at least the kind of moral issues important to someone like Tolkien.</li></ul><ul><li>The Balrog. Very frightening and demonic of course, but there's something else. There's a running debate in Tolkien-related newsgroups and BBS as to whether or not it had wings, as Tolkien's own description is very ambiguous. Jackson succeeded in being just as ambiguous visually, thus pleasing (or displeasing) both camps equally. I nearly laughed out loud in the theater when I realized what he'd done.</li></ul><ul><li>Having cut out all the other supporting characters to simplify the script, the method of Gandalf's rescue was perfectly in character.</li></ul><ul><li>We see a brief shot of Minas Tirith. Beautiful.</li></ul>And anything else not mentioned below.What was done wrong:<ul><li>The time compression at the beginning. Seventeen years were supposed to have passed between the Party and Gandalf's revelation of the true nature of the Ring. Instead it looked like a year or two at most, and this introduces a plothole. Bilbo's sudden aging was attributed to his putting the Ring aside, but why wasn't Gollum, who'd possessed the Ring for centuries, similarly affected?</li></ul><ul><li>Arwen's expanded role and Aragorn's mangled motivation. I thought Liv Ullman was just not up to this part. It was expanded at the expense of Aragorn's, Elrond's, and Gandalf's, and she would had to have been extraordinary to satisfy offended book fans. She wasn't. A line was given to Elrond that inexplicably removes a strong motivation for Aragorn to fulfill his heritage, whereas in the book it was a condition that he himself imposed before he would consent to their relationship. Since it would have enhanced both the romance and the adventure, why not leave it as it was?</li></ul><ul><li>Moria. The entire complex was supposed to have been a thriving city in the past, so what's with the impossibly steep staircases and the unrailed bridges over yawning abysses? It couldn't possibly have functioned. Even populated by Dwarves they would have lost a dozen or so pedestrians a day, and it dilutes the effect of the *one* unrailed bridge over a yawning abyss (part of Moria's defenses) near the exit.</li></ul><ul><li>Gimli. John Rhys-Davies has a wonderfully mobile face and a marvellous voice. Both were buried under so much latex and fake hair as to be useless. The actor was completely wasted here to the detriment of the character.</li></ul><ul><li>Blond elves? Who says?</li></ul><ul><li>Saruman's expanded role during the mountain crossing. The Fellowship was defeated by a malevolent nature spirit responding to Sauron's growing will, *not* a cranky wizard several hundred miles away acting at that moment for no reason we can perceive.</li></ul>Mostly, this is just the kind of nitpicky stuff a geek like me would pick up on. If you've never read the book, it won't bother you at all. No one who has not read the book who saw this movie that I asked even noticed, and all enjoyed it immensely. Go see it.",10,3,3,28 October 2002
The Lion King," Visually fantastic. Emotionally flat.
","There are significant pluses to be noted about this film. Visually, it's gorgeous. Renders of the characters and locations are virtually perfect, and it's easy to see why people persist in describing this as a live action remake when it's nothing of the sort. There's a lot to look at here, and for that reason I'm not sorry I saw it.Animal characters are given the behaviors of the real things without the anthropomorphism of the original film, even if some are geographically misplaced. The decision to make the hyena clan clearly matriarchal was a good one along these lines, and made a secondary line of conflict available which was sadly under-exploited. Another good decision was to much more clearly identify the disaster that overcame the pridelands under the hyenas as ecological due to over-hunting, with the conflict between Mufasa and Scar due in part to Scar's resentment over Mufasa's restraint and dedication to ecological balance.But there are so many problems. The direction was dull. Much of the time it felt as if they were simply going through the motions rather than presenting the story to stand on its own as dramatically as possible. Many have complained about the characters' expressionlessness. To me that's simply a consequence of choosing to render them realistically and not a bad thing per se. Emotion COULD have instead been conveyed by liberal use of body language, perhaps with a little exaggeration such as a human actor might use for greater audience impact. But this was not done for the most part. Only when they approach the climax do they begin to explore the full range of what they might have done throughout. The voice acting was, with a few notable exceptions, uninspired and often sounded rushed. I put this down to direction more than anything else, since I know what some of these actors are capable of. The decision to retain James Earl Jones for Mufasa was, perhaps, not well thought-out. He's now almost 90 years old, and sounds like it. While still impressive, his voice lacks the overpowering dynamism and range of his prime that made his original portrayal of Mufasa so memorable.I like some of the new directions of the script, but some of the decisions both large and small made me scratch my head. As noted above, a potentially tense secondary rivalry was hardly brought out. We saw it only at the climax. It's understandable that some of the more cartoonish action of the original was reblocked, but the new version was not always successful and sometimes came across as a lazy shortcut to the next scene. Young Simba was given a tag line 'I got this!' meant to show off his brash overconfidence. We don't hear it again after the death of Mufasa, but why should it not return when adult Simba recovers his proper identity? Why was 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' performed in broad daylight?All in all, a wasted opportunity.",5,2,4,29 July 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Miserable adaptation of a great story
","The actors were flawless, and in some cases brilliant. There are no special effects that were underdone, or done poorly. The sets are perfect. One might quibble about the costuming, but that's a minor concern and only in some cases; for the most part everyone is dressed as one might expect. So what's my complaint?This is obviously the product of a director and writers who did not feel they had a free hand to adapt this story to its medium. Everything that took up more than a few pages in the book seemed to rate at least a mention here, but very often having mentioned them they're dropped without a backward glance. Some events are portrayed that have no real bearing on the story as abridged, taking up footage that could have been used for better development of some of the minor characters. For reasons of space, most of the satire and humor is dropped entirely in favor of the occasional slapstick comic relief, such as the running gag about Seamus blowing himself up in the Charms class.Where's Dumbledore's wit, his sparkle, and his eccentricity? He's deep and sagacious, which is to say he's a stock wizard with no characteristics that distinguish him from dozens of others, and is completely lacking in the weirdness that made him so charming in the book. Where's Neville Longbottom's character development? He goes from losing his toad to getting paralyzed by Hermione with nothing in between. Rather than being given such short shrift, he should have been dropped from this movie entirely and saved for those moments later on where he'll be indispensable. Why even bother to include Norbert if you're not going to do anything with that subplot? Here it serves the sole purpose of being the cause for detention in the Forbidden Forest, but with all the other illicit doings of Harry & Co. some other pretext for could have been found. Surely they could have at least hinted at other Quidditch matches than the one that was actually portrayed; as it is, it stands alone and has no bearing on anything else that happens. I suppose they had to show it as it becomes very important in the later books, but it would have been better to work it into the plot somehow. These are just examples; I could name many more instances where the adaptation was very poorly done.But worst of all is there are times when this movie is boring. How Columbus managed *that* with the material at his disposal is pretty amazing. The only reason I can come up with for it is that he felt constrained, either by the author of the book or the fan community, to ensure that certain elements from the book appeared in the movie whether or not they made sense cinematically. He would have served the audience better with more boldness in departing from the book where necessary, instead of adhering to it where it made no sense to do so.",Null,0,0,19 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Not bad, but Lord, it wasn't *that* good!
","The inspiration was the space opera serials of the '30s to the '50s and numerous other sources, with the result that this movie is almost startlingly unoriginal. The script was not great. The acting was achingly uneven, from the brilliance of Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing to the awkward mouthings of Mark Hamill. The special effects were amazing only in their ubiquitousness; the techniques used were venerable -- and have been considerably 'spiced up' in the currently available video editions. Yeah, it was lots of fun, but beyond that it had no meaning or enduring value. So what inspired the fanatic following enjoyed by the Star Wars franchise?According to George Lucas, he was guided by the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell, who was able to distill from the world's folklore the foundational elements of myth. These are principles and images that resonate; our response is almost biologically hardwired. Using Campbell for a blueprint, Lucas constructed a modern retelling of the hero's journey. In this he didn't do a bad job, because the resonances are certainly there. This I think is key. It fools into thinking we are seeing a great story, because its structure causes us to react to it as we would to any number of other great stories. But the story cannot fill this structure. The mythological resonances blind us to the gaping plotholes, the shallow characterizations, the poor acting, and that godawful dialogue.A really harsh critique of this film is required not because it deserves it by any absolute measure -- indeed, under other circumstances it would really be too lightweight to merit the attention -- because against all reason it has become a standard by which all other movies of its genre are judged. There are far better candidates for that role than this.",5,4,11,4 September 2002
