The Blair Witch Project," The biggest Hoax in Film History!
","This was a painful experience. Argh! After watching a bunch of foul mouthed twenty something students walk around the woods with their camcorders, SUPPOSEDLY in search of a Witch, all we get is some running, screaming, and swearing. Where was the witch??? No witch. No witch? No witch. And the students are SUPPOSEDLY lost, walking in circles, unable to get out. Yeah... okay....how about following that damn river genius! Water flows out into a lake, perhaps? And then the ending. A boy is standing with his back turned, staring into the wall? The camera drops. Hahahhahahah.... So funny.Can I have my money back please? I was told that this movie was good. Why did I buy into this hoax. Please, save your money! This was one of the worst movies you'll ever see. Argh, I say!",1,2,4,21 October 2006
A Clockwork Orange," A Brilliant Piece of Art
","Words would not do this film enough justice. It is a masterpiece for so many reasons. First and foremost, the attention and detail with every scene and every frame of the movie is absolutely stunning. An excellent example would be the scene where the four hoodlums are in the restaurant/club after they have committed society's worst crimes. Whether it is the demeanor of the criminals, the decor of the restaurant, the patrons inside, or the dialogue, you get an understanding as to the type of director we are dealing with. This is what 'Art' is all about: from start to finish it is relentless non-linear poetry. Something that goes beyond analysis and simply is. 'A Clockwork Orange' is both profound and simple at the same time. It's indeed a social statement, a political statement, a statement on human nature, and many of those other things. Yet it does not judge or categorize its politics in neat little boxes or dichotomies - of left and right or right and wrong. It does not give thanks or offer solutions to any of those things either. That is why it is so brilliant. It simply breathes with its own breath. You watch this and easily understand why Stanley Kubrick is mentioned as one of the top 5 directors of all time. This film would have to be in the top 10 films of all time.Put this film into context (as you would all great films). If you were to watch this film in the 1950's (even though it wasn't made then), or 2050, it would have the exact same relevance. It's a timeless masterpiece. Definitely one of the finest films of all time!",10,8,13,28 December 2006
The Happening," One of the biggest bombs I have ever seen!
","Okay, so I am giving this a 1. It was absolutely horrendous. Would I recommend this movie to people? Absolutely. Why? Because it was probably the most entertaining bomb-of-a-movie I've ever seen. Trust me, you will laugh-out-loud. It was so bad that I am still waiting for Mark Wahlberg and M. Night Shamalyan to say, 'just joking, guys!' But no. I've seen interviews with both the actor and director - on separate occasions, and it turns out that what the movie was marketed as and from what these two discuss in interviews, we can gather that 'The Happening' was and is an earnest attempt at making a thriller. Both Wahlberg and Shamalyan talk about the premise and the seriousness of the story, and so on. But I kid you not, a thriller is not what you get. It's a comedy because we recognize how earnest this attempt was at making a thriller. And our realization of this while watching the absurd film makes it all the more entertaining and funny. Oh I definitely smell Razzies.The premise isn't even that bad, I have to say. Plants/nature turning on humans because of our destruction/lack-of-respect, etc. But the delivery... oh my! The acting is something to behold. It will have you believing that these actors may have in fact been lobotomized or invaded by kindergarten students during the filming. Particularly Mark Wahlberg. Okay, now some people might say that he is supposed to be a an innocent/naive-type character. Umm, no. His delivery of lines is on par with Keanu Reeves on a bad day. Is this the same actor that did 'The Departed'? Might not be Mark Wahlberg's fault. Perhaps it was the writing, directing, or editing: which, when combined, leaves the audience on several occasions in absolute hysterics. And I'm specifically talking about the parts that were supposed to be scary or suspenseful. So what gives? My guess is that M. Night lost his mojo a bit. He couldn't step up to the plate or knock down a three when called upon. If he was trying to make a comedy, however, I give him full credit. My uncontrollable laughter throughout was worth the full price of admission.Now, I have to say that I've been a fan of M Night Shamalyan for quite a while now. Obviously the 'Sixth Sense' was genius. By industry standards M. Night was pulling off an Orson Welles for the most part when he brought it out. By word-of-mouth, that movie made a mint. And for good reason. It featured multi-layered writing and flawless directing and people took notice. Then he followed it up with 'Unbreakable', an even better film in my opinion. Sheer genius actually. His take on the 'superhero/comic-book' genre was of the highest quality; it was original, sharp, and he got the best out of his actors. The problem is, his writing and directing at times is so ridiculously good that you think he can do no wrong. 'Signs' was a bit of a letdown. I felt he was relying on the special effects and the alien a bit too much in the third act. 'The Village' was unbelievably good. He took a slice of the time (post 9/11 world) and created an allegory of American society. I know I'm in the minority here with regard to that movie, but I felt he nailed it. So he is highly gifted in his craft, no doubt. Again it's the expectations. This happens with all great directors. 'Lady in the Water' was an embarrassment to say the least. I don't know what happened there, it was just plain boring and nothing seemed to happen. The editing, the acting, the writing, all bad. Was he, perhaps, a bit too self-involved? I think so. Now we get 'The Happening', which is the strangest movie of the bunch because it doesn't know what it is or what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a thriller? What is it? Do watch the movie, though. I am telling you, it is the best 'worse' movie you will ever see. Heck, I may give it a 10 after my next viewing. If I can just figure out what the hell I watched.",1,5,11,18 June 2008
Jackie Brown," Oh My God!
","I was so angry when I saw this one in the theater. Now I can just laugh at it. By and large, just overkill for Tarantino. Way too self absorbed. Perhaps he was over-thinking it? Perhaps he did way too much coke before doing this? I dunno. He had some good ideas, but he just couldn't deliver. There was one scene that worked for me. The exchange between Samuel Jackson and Chris Tucker. That was nice. It had some edgy realism that took you to another level. Some pure American street jive that portrayed hoods or gangsters, showing the gritty underbelly of America. And if Tarantino went that harsh realistic route it may have been a good movie; an interesting departure for Tarantino. But unfortunately after that scene it simply fell apart. He tried to do too much. The worst scene was the one in the mall where you had three different takes on one scene. A complete waste of time because it was a useless scene to begin with. If that isn't self gratuitous I don't know what is. And DeNiro. Man was he embarrassing! I don't think that was his fault. What the hell kind of character was that?? For such an accomplished actor too. On the other hand you give Pam Grier the lead? Bad choice QT. Oh well, you can forgive Tarantino for this one. Every director has a stink bomb. And considering he has done 'Resevoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2', and wrote 'Natural Born Killers' and 'True Romance' (all brilliant films), he has plenty of room to mess up.",1,15,39,20 October 2006
