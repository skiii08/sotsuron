Casablanca," Historical of Sorts
","This movie has more to it that what meets the eye. It takes place in Casablanca in the midst of WWII, centered as a meeting point for 3 main groups: Nazis, the French, and fugitives. This movie takes the personality and the romantic events in France with a former lover that drive the main character into isolation and revokes his relationships with others in order to avoid taking sides. He found that it is not going to end and decides to pick his side: against the Nazis. This lead him to leave his lover to another man to fight in his new destiny that will follow him into the near future in the war. This movie is filled with symbolizing details and should not be taken lightly.",Null,2,3,11 March 2012
Citizen Kane," One of the Best Movies Prior To My Birth Worth Watching
","When some people think of movies that were out in black and white, they also think of boring moments and bland acting. That is just a bad stereotype. This movie is the symbol of true American movies and kills this stereotype with its meaning. This movie shows how great people can rise to the top and somehow lose themselves, as well as this fame within a short amount of time. It also shows that even though a person can have a lot of nice things, they can't have everything, including Charles Kane, who lost his childhood to rise to the top. This movie was extremely beautiful and anyone who tells you that it is terrible has got to have issues to call a masterpiece anything less than its title.",Null,0,1,11 May 2012
The Birth of a Nation," History Has Hit The Mark With This Film
","Created by D.W. Griffith, this movie is a tale that radiates true events about the Civil War and past. In it are two sides: the North, who want to fix the nation and help deteriorate slavery, and the South, who wish to be a stronger nation that the North and protect the ways of slavery. After the events of the Civil War, slaves were granted new rights, but the South, however, find it difficult to take and decide to use their power to terrorize the blacks, becoming the now feared Ku Klux Klan, and racist movement. Soon, they start to take the fight to them and killed many blacks as a result.They way that he has put these events into a movie and show people just what happened to the former slaves is mind boggling. No one could have seen this coming...",Null,0,3,11 March 2012
The Exorcist," Scary As Hell
","When the word 'horror' comes to mind, a lot of people would back to movies like 'Dracula' and 'Frankstein' as perfect examples. But there is one thing they don't know: this movie is just on the same level of horror as the form movies. One of the most freakiest things I've seen in the movie, the sight of the little girl and what she looked like, sent shivers down my back and horror movies could never give me anything creepier than that. The fact that a movie like this has been around for so long made me wonder why a movie like this hasn't been involved with many controversies that today's horror movies receive do to content, even though they score nothing like this one. Kudos to William Friedkin for making something like this the backbone behind fear.",Null,1,2,11 May 2012
Annie Hall," Very Funny and a Classic
","This movie, this movie is the reason why the change can always be good. The director, who made this movie was also actor as well, decided to make a change in his acting to be more serious. This, however, instead made a hybrid of both his seriousness and his funniness. One of the most enjoy scenes were the scene where each of the little kids in his class in the beginning told us their demented futures and the scene where the woman and the man are waiting at the theater to watch a film with the guy talking behind them and then the main male role pulls an actual director into the fray. This film actually made me laugh, and I normally don't laugh during movies.",Null,0,0,11 May 2012
The Graduate," Decent In A Way
","The Graduate takes the life of a graduate to a whole new level in this movie. It is filled with some neat shots, including an underwater scene and scenes of illegal sex shown in the dark to hide it from public view. The only thing that got tedious with the film is that most of the scenes shows him driving a car and they keep playing the same songs throughout, with drove me insane. Other than that, the film was clear in the idea of how many graduate are unaware of what they want for their future. Even if you found it too difficult to stand those car scenes, it doesn't make it a bad movie. Actually, the movie is a good choice to watch in my opinion.",Null,0,0,11 May 2012
Singin' in the Rain," This Movie Is Singin' in the Excellent Movie Category
","Between 1930's and 1950's, musicals were considered the poison of the movie industry. This movie, however, was one of the best musicals released in the 20th century. This one included many feelings of happiness and compassion and was very entertaining to watch. With lots of color as well as some of the wits shown by some of the many characters, especially the end,this movie has lived up to the height and made it to the top of best movies of all time. All in all, the movie, in my opinion, was a spectacular piece of work and deserved its position on higher lists. It also caught my interest that the lead actress was also involved in a movie that I had also watched just recently.",Null,0,2,11 May 2012
