It," A Coming of Age film with a terrifyingly playful Dancing Clown
","Good: Right from the beginning, the movie grips you and proves to be a promising horror movie. The cast all-around are excellent and have great chemistry together. The movie zones in on the adolescents and creates feelings and emotions for the main characters, while also telling the story of their daily life conflicts. The conversations the characters have also provide comedic moments sprinkled throughout the movie. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is amazing and acts in such a creepy and effective way to convey a clown we can all fear. In the beginning, the movie does not rely on jump scares; instead it goes for a creepy and unsettling tone with its ominous imagery. The horror elements are well done, thanks to director Andy Muschietti. Also the cinematography does a great job of having an 80s vibe and pays homage to old-school horror. Bad: At times the pacing is slow and can drag on a bit even in the horror parts. The children's conflicts with fear can get repetitive as it has the need to show all 7 of them dealing with Pennywise and not technically moving the story along with all of them. When CGI was needed for Pennywise it came as a distraction and had a shaky cam look. As the film draws to an end the scenes tend to be less effective and drag on as it creeps its way to the climax.Overall: This movie is excellent with a great cast that has to band together and discover ways to resolve each other's conflicts. 'It' satisfies the 'Stranger Things' crave and even gets a little more out of its clown antagonist. 'It' is definitely worth the watch in a theater as you can appreciate the coming-of-age and horror aspects mixed together.4.3/5",9,6,16,8 September 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Teenage Deadpool
","Good: Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, and Michael Keaton as Vulture are excellent and deliver their roles exceptionally. They each contribute to the coming of age theme well and their dialogue is entertaining. There are numerous comedic moments and even though some jokes fall flat there are enough to leave a smile on your face. This movie with its uniqueness did a great job of portraying Spider-Man and his teenage life. Bad: The action sequences were good, but lacked hand to hand combat and relied more on web shooting. The finale lacked suspense and action. Some parts of the movie can be slow or boring. Although Michael Keaton was fantastic as Vulture I found his motive weak and not effective. Overall: It is worth the watch, but do not expect anything spectacular or amazing. Despite the action sequences lacking and not having much depth, the comedic moments and your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man are enough to keep you entertained in the 2h 13 min run time.3.8/5",8,7,13,7 July 2017
Logan," Film Version of The Last of Us
","Riveting, Gory, and Well-ActedHugh Jackman gives a terrific performance and works well with Dafne Keen. Their relationship has heart and care for one another. The action sequences are amazing and from the opening scene you can tell this will be a superhero movie that is not going to hold back on its action sequences. I do wish Wolverine and X-23 could have done more fight scenes together and complemented each other in combat, yet the scenes were still entertaining. From the emotional relationship to the plot and character of wolverine this film had my interest most of the time. This is a great superhero film that is not like most where it has the need relate to other superheros or other films, but instead has its own movie that excels. A film that reminds me of The Last of Us game and is truly a heartfelt and entertaining film.4.5/5",9,13,28,14 June 2017
Midsommar," A Mesmerizing and Gorgeous 140 min Slow Burn Behemoth
","Good: Hands down the production and cinematography are amazing and truly comes to life over the course of the film to emphasize the film's purpose/themes. The cast overall is great, each one playing their role respectively whether it is an outsider or a cult member, especially Florence Pugh who goes through a lot over the course of the film.Bad: The film moves relatively at a great pace until near the 3rd act and then takes its time to craft its ending and at times dragged and started to get stale. There are so many clues/culture traditions learned through brief images of paintings and drawings in the community. Although this serves great for analysis and more viewings as a first watch it is a lot to comprehend and can be confusing near the end if you do not remember some of the drawings. It goes without saying that the characters do not make the smartest of decisions and there are quite a few horror cliches.Overall: The film triumphs in creating a beautiful yet disturbing atmosphere in broad daylight. There are powerful performances filled with emotions. However, the run-time goes a little past its run time and an ending that was not the most satisfying. Although I'll be back for more viewings to see the easter eggs and hidden clues, I personally prefer 'Hereditary' over this one.3.5/5*Pro-Tip look at the painting/drawings from right to left
*I strongly do not recommend this to children, 18+ mainly because of the slow-burn and material.",7,83,157,4 July 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," An All-Star Cast and a Vintage Style Cannot Shine in a Lackluster Story
","Good: The amazing all-star cast of academy award winners. Even though each actor/actress plays their role well, no one was a standout. The setting of most of the movie is the Orient Express, which helps contribute to a trapped and isolated feel and makes you feel as if you were there with the detective. The introductory to Hercule Poirot is great, but as the movie chugs alongBad: Overall, the movie lacks comedy and heartfelt moments. At times, the accent of Poirot is hard to understand, which leads to clues that are not clearly understood and a story that is hard to follow along. The movie is more of an interrogation of each character, by just going down the huge list of suspects and giving each character equal screen time. It progresses at a slow pace and the clues never lean me towards one person or another. I also did not find the murder to be inventive or creative. Overall: Even with an outstanding cast, the movie suffers from a generic plot. The movie lacks the engaging aspects of a crime movie and relies too heavily on its cast to deliver its moments. 2.7/5",5,15,47,2 November 2017
