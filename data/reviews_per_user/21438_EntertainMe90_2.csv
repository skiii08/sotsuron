Hereditary," Awesome techniques, horrible story!
","This movie should have been so much better than the end result. There is plenty of great cinematography, acting, and great effects. The story was just not worthy of the other aspects of this film. The story alternates between a physiological thriller, ghost story, and cult piece. Anyone of these directions could have worked, but together they just all got in the other's way and your left with a feeling of utter disappointment and confusion. I would watch another movie directed by Ari Aster....I would not see another movie written by Ari Aster.",4,0,0,21 July 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Well Blended Movie
","This movie does a great job of not lingering on any one aspect too long....the making of the music, the story of the band, and the story of Freddie Mercury.....all interweave without fixating on any one part for too long. The camera and audio work was innovative and purposeful without seeming gimmicky. The only slight from Bohemian Rhapsody....the movie stops at a pinnacle instead of following through (which would have given the film more weight).",8,3,4,5 November 2018
