Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolutely hilarious!
","I saw this movie early last month at the Traverse City Film Festival. It was shown in a small theater, which was completely packed out. This movie provoked one long, sustained hour and a half laugh from EVERYONE in the theater, despite the age/gender/racial diversity of the crowd and the film being horribly offensive and disgusting. I honestly can't think of a scene that was not funny. This will be the movie of 2006, and I highly advise you to see it when it comes out. Everyone with a decent sense of humor can appreciate this movie, especially those of you who are fans of Da Ali G Show. You will NOT REGRET seeing this movie. I can't wait until I can see it in theaters.",10,6,29,16 September 2006
