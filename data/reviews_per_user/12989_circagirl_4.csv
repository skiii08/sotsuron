Scarface," A perfect antihero character piece
","Amazing character development, tense direction, and iconic action. It's a must see.",10,0,0,26 March 2020
The Duchess," Amazing performance from Kiera Knightly
","I thought Kiera was one of those actresses you call in to duck-bill her lips and look hot but she proved her chops in this. She really brings out the pain, heartbreak, and at turns, the enduring spirit and humor of the Duchesd of Devonshire. Her marriage was the dictionary definition of a gilded cage and there wasn't a moment I didn't want to reach in and slap her husband. The film attempts to humanize him at points, implying that he might be just as trapped by the imperial system, but it was hard to buy that after he rapes her and takes on her best friend as a permanent in-house mistress. The only other complaint I have is that the duchesses affair with her childhood lover isn't given much screentime. I just couldn't see the chemistry and he looked like a dollar store Rami Malek.",9,0,0,26 March 2020
Jerry Maguire," Just try and not be charmed by this
","A sports shark suddenly decides wants to be a good person. Such a simple premise, yet Tom Cruise brings so much endearing energy and earnestness that you can't helped but be pulled in. SHOW ME THE MONEY!!",9,1,1,26 March 2020
Ben-Hur," Epic Story of Childhood Friends Turned Enemies in the Midst of Christ's Growing Influence
","I was really surprised by the amount of bromance in the beginning- Heston looks like he's two decisions away from kissing his old friend at some points in their reunion! Men are not usually portrayed as being so vulnerable and close with other guys. This makes it all the more sad when their religious-political differences tear them apart. The high quality set design, passionate acting, gorgeous costumes, enigmatic parallels with Christ's journey to the cross, and the beyond iconic chariot race scene make it worth anyone's time.",8,0,1,16 March 2020
