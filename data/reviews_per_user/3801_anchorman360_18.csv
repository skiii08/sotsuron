United 93," A sad reminder of a sad day
",This movie begins with the four terrorists praying in their hotel room before they go on their suicide mission. After that we see some of the passengers of flight 93 coming to the airport. We also get to see the confusion of the air traffic controllers who can't believe what is happening. I think the idea to have unknown actors was a great choice because it made the movie more realistic. The two saddest parts where when the one terrorist killed the two pilots and took control of the plane and the end when it crashed right into the ground. The passengers may have failed to save their lives but succeeded to stop the terrorists plans to hit the white house. This is the first movie I've seen dealing with 9/11 and it was very sad. I remember seeing a preview for this in theaters when I saw 'Inside Man' and thought that looks like a really good movie and it was. The director Paul Greengrass really knew what he was doing with this movie by honoring those brave people on that flight. This movie definitely deserves its 7.9 rating on this website. If you haven't seen this movie yet then go and rent it and get ready to cry. One of the saddest movies I've seen and so far the best movie of 2006.,10,0,1,20 December 2006
Friday Night Lights," My Favorite Sports Movie!
","This movie was really good because it was exciting and dramatic. The movie is about a high school football team in 1988 Odessa, Texas. Everybody in town is expecting them to go to and win state. Billy Bob Thorton plays the head coach of the team. Derek Luke stars as the Boobie Miles the star running back. Garret Hedlund is the running/tailback with butter finger hands and an abusive dad played by Tim Mcgraw. In the first game of the season Miles gets hurt with the team at a 42-7 lead with 2 minutes left. That leads everyone to blame the coach for keeping him in the game. However backup running back Chris Comer and starting quarterback Mike Winchell played by Lucas Black rise up to the challenge and take the team to the playoffs. Other players include cornerback Brian Chavez played by Jay Hernandez who later starred in Hostel. They go to state and battle Dallas-Carter. Its a very exciting game with them losing just coming up inches short of the game winning touchdown. This movie is very good and I give it 9 stars out of 10.",9,0,2,23 December 2006
Fight Club," An Amazing Movie
",This movie stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt as two men who start an underground fighting league and escalates into lots of crime. Norton has his apartment room burn down and moves into a crappy house with Pitt.Norton's life is completely turned upside down when a crack addict (Helen Habona Carter)enters his life. The two men get several people to help them because they are convinced that god does not like them. The movie is directed by David Fichner who also directed Seven. Norton gives the best performance of his career and Pitt's is really good. If you haven'y seen it yet then go see it now!,10,2,5,9 January 2007
Hostel," A Nasty Horror Flick
","I rented Hostel expectimg it to be very scary and gross. It wasn't so much scary but it was very sick like I thought it would be. It's about two American guys and an Iceland guy who check into a hotel hoping to stay their for a couple of nights. However they soon find out that they won't be checking out. The first half an hour of the movie or so is just them trying to have sex with several different women. However that seems to be for a reason. Some whores sleep with them and take them to get tortured.From the 30 minute mark on it is all suspenseful and fast paced. You get to see feet get cut, drill no body, toes clipped, fingers cut off and eyes get burned out. So if you love torture you'll really enjoy this movie.",7,2,2,16 January 2007
Crash," My favorite movie ever
","Wow this movie was excellent from start to finish. I saw it for the first time about a year ago and loved it. It definitely deserved to win the best picture Oscar. The movie shows a bunch of people in LA who are all connected to each other through racism. What made me want to see this movie wasn't what it was about, it was the long list of actors in the movie. There is Don Cheadle, Matt Dillion, Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Philippe, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, Thandie Newton, and Terrance Howard who I hadn't heard of before this movie. the movie shows a bunch of races in a 24 hour period. A lot of people think that Brokeback Mountain deserved to win the best picture and even though i haven't seen that i would have to say this would be the better movie. So go and see it I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed.",10,5,12,21 December 2006
Watchmen," Why is there so much hate?
","This has to be one of the most mixed reviewed movies of all time along with Passion of the Christ and Snyder's own 300. I really loved watching this and didn't really get bored even though it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. Jackie Earle Haley's Roarshach was one of the most bad ass characters that I have ever seen in a movie. He was definitely the best part of the movie and all his scenes get your attention. I thought that Billy Crudup made Dr. Manhattan a very interesting character, Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl was also very interesting as was Matthew Goode as Ozy, and Morgan was perfect as The Comedian who was the most unlikeable 'hero' ever in a movie. A lot of people think Ackerman was terrible and while she wasn't very good she was OK. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead and thought 300 was alright but this is snyder's best movie so far and everyone should see it just because it's such a cool looking movie and Roarshach deserves his own movie.",7,0,3,13 July 2009
Pearl Harbor," It Really Isn't That Bad
","Everybody seems to think that this movie is horrible. I'm guessing that most people say that because they either don't like Ben Affleck or they don't like the director Michael Bay. However I have to say that this movie was pretty good. This movie is exactly the same as Titanic and everybody loved that so there is no reason for everybody to have such a problem with this movie. Most people say that the love story was bad but it was pretty decent. Ben Afflect and Josh Hartnett plat two American pilots training for war then Affleck falls in Love with a nurse played by Kate Beckinsale the he volunteers to go to fight the war and is assumed to be dead, then Hartnett falls in love with her, after that Afflect comes to Hawaii and finds out what has happened. Then pearl harbor gets bombed by the Japs and after that both of them are a part of the Doolittle raid on Japan and their plane gets shot down Hartnett dies and Affleck lives. I admit the ending was not great but altogether the movie was pretty good and enjoyable.",6,1,2,22 December 2006
Batman Begins," By Far the Best Batman Movie!
","This is a prequel to the other four batman flicks and you now what it is a whole lot better than all of them. This time it is Christian Bale who plays Bruce Wayne/Batman and is really good. There is also a long line of other famous people such as Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Commissionor Gordon, Liam Nesson as Ducard who trains Bruce but he betrays Ducard when he refuses to kill a criminal, Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend, Tom Wilkinson as Valconie who runs a big crime ring in Gotham, and Morgan Freeman as a Scientist who provides Bruce with a ton of gadgets including a new bat tank. Batman Begins is directed excellently by Christopher Nolan who also directed 'Memento'. This appears to be the role that made Christian Bale more famous. This is the second best movie of 2005 if you like action movie then go see it because you'll surly love it.",9,2,2,3 February 2007
Saving Private Ryan," My Favorite War Movie
","In my opinion saving private Ryan is the most entertaining and realistic war movie you can find to have been released. It takes place during ww2 and starts out with the invasion of Normandy known as d-day shown as excruciatingly violent. Right after this 8 men receive a mission to find a private Ryan because his other three brothers have already died in the war. The men begin to wonder why the 8 of them are risking their lives to save just another soldier. Tom Hank gives a very good performance as the leader of the team who keeps the group together when things start to go wrong. Tom Sizemore is the second man in command, Ed Burns is the soldier who doesn't like the mission more than anyone of them, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper and Jeremy Davies are three other soldiers in the group. Vin Diesel and Giovonni Ribisi are the two men who die before they find Private Ryan played by Matt Damon. The movie is 2 and 3/4 hours long but move along fast and ends before you know it. If you have not seen this movie then you are missing out on something special.",10,3,5,17 August 2007
Saw II," Just As Intense As Saw 1
",I watched Saw 2 shortly after it came out on DVD and thought that it was even better than the first. In the first two guys were stuck in a room and in this one its 8 people trapped inside a house and have two hours to get out because they are all being poisoned. Meanwhile Detective Matthews (Donnie Whalberg) captures Jigsaw in his layer but soon finds out that his son is one of the 8 people. The movie's opener is awesome with a guy wearing a trap called the Venus flytrap. He has a minute to get it off but finds out that the key is in his eye but he can't get it out so his head gets crushed and he dies. As for the other deaths one guy dies when he ignores the tape recorder and gets shot through the eye. The second person crawls into an oven to get the needles but decides to be stupid and pull the third one gets burned to death. If you enjoyed the first saw you will enjoy this one too.,6,0,1,21 January 2007
The Insider," Surprised by how much I enjoyed it!
",The first time I saw this movie I just thought it would be a very boring and slow movie. However I actually thought this was a very compelling movie even though it goes by very slowly. Unlike Mann's other movies like Heat and Collateral I really loved this one the first time I saw it. In my opinion this is one of Pacino's best movies and Crowe gives his best performance which is even better and the complete opposite of his character in LA Confidential. This is Mann's best movie and my third all time favorite behind Zodiac and Pulp Fiction. Despite Pacino struggling to get the interview aired he makes being a producer for 60 minutes seem like it would be a very fun job to have. I really think Crowe should have won best actor and the movie should have won best picture because like a lot of other great movies you'll never get tired of watching it.,10,0,2,13 July 2009
Saw," A Very Good Thriller
","This movie is the best and most exciting serial killer movie that i've ever seen. It starts with two guys stuck in a very dirty bathroom. One of them is a doctor and the other one is a photographer. There is also a dead guy in the room with them in a lot of blood with a gun in one of his hands and a tape recorder in his other hand. Both men are tied up in chains and are given two saws but are meant for them to cut their feet off not the chains. The doctor soon realizes that it's the jigsaw killer that put both of them in the room to solve a puzzle. Then there is a flashback to other victims like one who has to crawl through a lot of barb wire to get out of a room, another with a man who has to figure out the combination to safe and the combination is on the wall but he has a candle but the stuff on the wall is flammable and he is walking on glass. A women also have a trap that will crush her head if she doesn't get the key out of a mans body. The doctor is accused of doing the crime by two cops. The movie was a surprise hit that was shot in less than 3 weeks.",7,1,3,26 December 2006
Inside Man," What An Awesome Movie
",This was a very good cops/robbers movie. It was very unpredictable which in my opinion is awesome and made the movie more exciting. Denzel Washington is awesome as the cop who deals with the situation. Clive Owen plays the leader of the group of the robbers. This movie was definitely not the usual cop stops bad guy movie which is nice. During the movie Washington and his partner talk with the hostages from the bank which I hadn't seen before. I loved the ending when Owen walks by Washington and slips the diamond into his pocket and he doesn't even know it. I was surprised when it was revealed that the robbers used toy guns the whole time. I must say this has to be my favorite Denzel Washington of all the ones I've seen. A very entertaining and unpredictable movie that you should see.,10,1,3,21 December 2006
Pulp Fiction," Very Good But somewhat Overrated
","When Pulp Fiction came out in 1994 it was nominated for best picture but lost to 'Forrest Gump'. It put John Travolta's career back together, made Samuel L. Jackson a big star and made director Quinten Tarintino even more famous. This movie is currently on #8 on the top 250 list which is too high for a movie like this. Bruce Willis is also in this but he was already well known for the 'Die Hard' series. It follows three different stories in a 24 hour period in LA. There are some parts that are really good. My favorite one is Travolta and Jackson's conversation in the car right before it is revealed that they are both hit men who work for a man named Marcellus played by Ving Rhames. Another part that I really enjoyed was after Travolta's character accidentally shoots a guy in the head and both of them must get rid of the body with the help of the wolf(Harvey Keitel) and Jimmie (Tarintino). So this is a movie that you will most likely enjoy even though it does get boring at times.",10,0,2,3 February 2007
The Departed," A Classic Crime Thriller!
","I got the departed for my birthday a few months back and I thought that it was one of the best movies that i had ever seen. Dicaprio gives a really good performance as Billy Costigan, an undercover cop in the Boston Police department. Damon is also really good as Colin Sullivan a criminal in frank costello's gang played by Jack Nicholsoin. Whalberg has a small but interesting part in an Oscar nominated role as the no bull cop dignam. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin give good performances in small roles as cops.Martin Scorsesce won the best director award for the first time in his long career and the movie won the big best picture award. So if your looking for an entertaining movie then go out to the movie store nearest and rent this classic today!",9,1,2,17 August 2007
Die Hard," My Favorite Action Movie
",This is by far the most exciting action movie I have ever seen. There is a lot of shooting and things that get blown up. This movie was Bruce Willis's first big movie. He stars as John Mcclane a New York cop who flies to LA to see his Wife and kids for Christmas. Then while people are taken hostage by the bad guys Mcclane escapes and starts shooting the terrorists one at a time. My favorite part was when Mcclane throws a chair with c-4 on it down the elevator shaft and a big part of the building blows up. This movie has been copied a lot but is still very fun to watch. Alan Rickman plays the leader of the bad guys and is very scary. I also enjoyed the two sequels and I am really looking to the Fourth one coming out in 2007. A definite 10 out of 10,10,4,4,21 December 2006
Heat," It Was Alright
","'Heat is a crime thriller about a cop played by Pacino who tries to catch Robert De Nero as an expert thief. There is some action in it but overall there is lots of blah blah blah then a little excitement then some more blah blah. Several famous actors have parts such as Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner and several others. The movie runs for just less than three hours which is about 45 minutes too long in my opinion. When Michael Mann makes movies he has a tendency to make the film drag and run a lot longer than it should be and try and make up for it by putting a scene where there is a lot of action. In Heat there is a big shootout after a bank robbery but it takes forever to get to that point of the movie. So if you want to rent a big action movie that is really intense than just rent something else and just catch it on TV.",9,3,9,3 February 2007
300," Cool Movie!
",I saw this movie already hearing that it had cool action scenes and also about there being no plot which the action didn't make up for. Now I have to sat there was a lot of amazing action sequences and sort of a plot but I didn't care and you probably won't care much either. It is about 300 Spartans who are fighting against thousands of Persians. They fight until they all die proudly at the end. There are plenty of slow motion stabbings and killings to make you go WOW. I don't get why movies like this and Troy have such mixed reviews when they are entertaining which they are supposed to be. It's better than watching a boring history lesson on ancient colonies. If you want a historically accurate movie than look somewhere else otherwise you'll enjoy it a lot.,6,1,2,10 October 2007
