Blade Runner 2049," What Point?
","Perusing the reviews I notice that defenders of this sequel are either defending the admittedly impressive graphics and effects or claiming there is a point to this film's story. There was a point to the story of the prequel. There is not one here. Perhaps suffering from not having the source material of a novel, BR2049 slowly staggers from one scene to the other and wants to magically believe a pregnancy happens.I am not a lesbian, but the women in this film were gorgeous. I even thought I would love to satisfy my man the way they satisfied K in this film. Wouldn't that be novel and fun? I am sure a sequel to this is coming because they planted the idea of a revolution and an army here, but I am not sure it will be worth it.",Null,4,8,19 October 2017
