Mission: Impossible III," Decent and Fun
","I saw MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3 tonight and came out smiling. It was tons better than John Woo's effort in the 2nd installment, but it still felt short of what I would consider a 'mission: impossible' attitude. The first film incorporated tons of great original action, a nice twisty plot, and some decent babes. This one had some great action, a killer villain (but I'm incredibly partial to Hoffman), a fairly decent script, but a fairly formula storyline. If you want a decent, fun action movie where Tom Cruise isn't quite as annoying as he has been for the past few months. He did a good job. With small spots by Lawrence Fishburne, Billy Crudup and an all too short cameo by Keri Russel, this movie was worth the money, but I'm not surprised that it didn't grab the numbers that Hollywood hoped to garner. Hollywood has a LONG way to go with many movie goers. After all, who can forget such gems as STAY ALIVE, SCARY MOVIE 4, FAR FROM HEAVEN, and STAR WARS EPII? It'll take more than one or two decent movies for folks to regain their confidence in the industry once they stop insulting our intelligence.",7,0,5,9 May 2006
