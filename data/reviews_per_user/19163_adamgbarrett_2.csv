First Man," Some beautiful visuals but overall slightly disappointing.
","I was really looking forward to the film but from the opening scenes I knew it wasn't going to be what I expected. It had a indie film vibe with shakey hand held camera shots throughout, and long lingering shots. It was about Neil and his inner demons and family life mostly. It did make you realise that NASA were lucky to get them to the moon at all! The actual moon landing was spectacular though.",7,8,28,7 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I loved it.
","I think the people putting on negative reviews must think they are watching a Shakespeare film... Its Star Wars!! I have watched every film as it came out and I loved this. A fitting end to the series, it was great. Don't listen to these boring people who think it's a religion and want to find fault in everything. Finally my 14 year old son loved it as well.",9,3,15,19 December 2019
