Skyfall," Welcome back, Mr. Bond
","(this is spoiler-free as I realise most people won't have seen this yet.)Oh. my. word.Skyfall is amazing.It is Bond. It is Bond with heart, with character. Bond with armour and without. It is a throwback to the classic Bond, a standing ovation to the earliest Bonds - and yet modern, fresh, gritty, brutal. You *feel* things in Skyfall. Bond feels things, like in CR - but unlike CR which was Bond becoming Bond, here we have Bond as Bond - witty, debonair,charming, dangerous, a man who lives in the shadows and occasionally puts on a front of lightness. It is a more personal, character-driven film - but with superb action and AMAZING cinematography (seriously - some of the images in this film put Nolan's films in the shade!). The pre-credit sequence (yes, it's back) is worth the price of admission alone. In one way CR was like a break from the old Bonds. It was a fresh start and the stench of Ye Old Bonde had to be washed off. But now in Skyfall it's all grown up, and so can appreciate it's roots - like a teenager realising their parents aren't always wrong.It is brilliant. Go and see it. It's fantastic. (And if it wasn't Bond, it would win an Oscar or three. As it is, it may just yet - it's that good)Welcome back Mr. Bond.",10,10,29,26 October 2012
Interstellar," 1 out of 3 acts worth seeing
","Sooo, finally watched this. And, um, underwhelmed. The first act was way too long. It tipped over from hmm, interesting to okay, boring. Way too much exposition dump and set up for no reason (like the drone thing - no point. AI combines. No point.). Technology flip-flopped between 1950s and 2040 with no explanation or logic. Him leaving his daughter was complete crap. Why the sudden rush to leave? The wormhole was closing? No. Umm. Hmm. There was no reason for him to leave so suddenly AT ALL. Except plot. Then we were treated to a 2001 homage as we watched the ship take off, then dock. Wow. We've seen it before. It's not cool now. It's boooring. Why not show a truck backing up. Beep. Beep. Beep. The middle section (2nd act) was really well done. Great visuals. Great premise with the time dilation. The strongest part was his sons life unfolding in minutes.But the third act (THe end) - what a train-smash. LOVE TRANSCENDS DIMENSIONS. Why? Umm, because. 5D beings just happen to lock onto Murphs room and just happen to provide him a space to affect her room - but not anything smart like a pen or something. Oh, and not to forget the humanist gospel HUMANITY SAVES ITSELF! We've trashed this planet and screwed things royally and even if there's like 4 of us and the future of the human race is in our hands we'll try to kill each other.. but add time and we'll become these amazing supernatural beings who will conquer the universe and manipulate spacetime and benignly save our own asses. well, here's hoping! Oh, and why did he launch off into the black hole for no reason whatsoever, since they still had another robot? Gaah. And the old Murph reunion was weird. Hi Dad. Hi Murph. It was you - I figured it out. The old watch was jumping so I knew you were my ghost because .... love? Yes, love sounds good. LOOOOOOOOVE! Ha. Now bugger off Dad, I've got my own family here. Hey, Brand was hot, go find her (and never mind about the time distortion affects of slingshotting around the black hole while you went through it. I'm sure she'll be the same hot young thing as when you left her.... (I also really disliked the overused score, particularly in the first act. It droned on and on and on and on and on and on and.. well you get the idea.) Anyway, those were my thoughts upon viewing INTERSTELLAR (aka Nolans homage to 2001 and soap operas). I rated it a 5/10 because VFX was good, some good ideas, and some great acting. Oh, and that docking scene with the damaged spacecraft. Alright alright alright.",3,6,10,3 August 2015
Drive," Gaaaah! Crap 70/80's movies are back
","It is unusual that I get so bored by a movie that I turn it off part way through. This movie was boring. Really boring. It's a late 70's early 80's film - one of those that never goes anywhere, and never offers any explanation for anything that's going on in the 'plot'.Main character is a blank canvas, who suddenly explodes into violence (without any forewarning or indication this was possible). the love interest is as thick as a brick to allow this weirdo into her life,. Zero chemistry between the two.Soundtrack has a bass rumble nearly the ENTIRE way through. Why??!And the music is cheesy 80's synth crap. I watched Wall Street before this movie and was AMAZED by the similarities.After being bored to death by the chemistry-less 'love story' violence suddenly explodes. And I laughed. It was so ridiculous, and so 'ooh, look at me showing brutal violence on screen' it broke the '4th wall'. And I pitied the director.Oh, this was a disappointment. Avoid at all costs. Or rent some random late 70's 'slice of life' movies. They'll be better.",1,2,5,18 February 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: An Ode to Stanley Kubrick, by Stanley Kubrick
","It's utter sophomoric tripe. Kubrick thinks the audience are absolute idiots. He focuses on a thing - then on what it represents. then on the thing. then on what is represents, then on the thing. Repeat, ad nauseum. The man can't direct for toffee. Oh yes, the special effects are good, some of the ideas in the movie are good - but the movie fails because it is utterly boring, drowning in Kubrick's own self obsession. People go on and on about the technical minutiae - like that's genius - to show the boring bits everyone else edits out - BECAUSE THEY'RE BORING! 2001 is 20 minutes of a good film stretched out over 3 hours! I am an avid reader and watcher of sci-fi. I love the genre because it provokes you to think. This movie was not thought-provoking, but sleep inducing, and caused me not to ponder the human condition, but instead how Kubrick got away with producing the navel-gazing piece of self-adulation. It practically cries out 'look at me! look how clever I am! I can do things no one else does and get away with it because I am clever!' (Seems he did get away with it with all the fawning adulation he's got over the years!)",2,13,24,1 September 2009
The Fountain," Death is not awe
","Watched 'the Fountain' the other day (yes, I know it's an old film). A film with some interesting premises, interesting cinematography, and unusual style, let down abominably by its underlying philosophy: 'Death is awe'.Talk about calling evil good! (Rom 1 & Isa 5:20) Death is not awe. You will not be part of a tree. You will not fly with the sparrow when it eats the tree's fruit. Death is a horrible, brutal curse. The doctor was right to 'rage, rage against the dying of the night'!With people desperately afraid of the curse of death, I can understand why the Fountain was so warmly embraced. But it offers a mirage, an illusion. Pretending that death is awe instead of acknowledging that death is awful is just that - a pretence. And one that will not suffice when faced with the awful reality of death.There is only one who has faced down death and defeated it. Only God Himself, our Lord Jesus, the Christ, could defeat death - and he did so, in our place. In Him, the fear of death is no more - death has no sting. There is only one refuge from death, and it is not in the whimsical folly of an otherwise interesting movie.",3,1,5,14 May 2012
Me Before You," A hate story
","If you are disabled, kill yourself. That's the message of the movie, packaged in a 'love' story. It's just another attempt to undermine the sanctity of life and normalise euthanasia. Horrific. Real love sometimes means saying 'no' to people when they're wrong. Allowing someone to commit suicide just because they are disabled is not love. Disabled people aren't second-class citizens. They are people!",1,34,59,8 August 2017
