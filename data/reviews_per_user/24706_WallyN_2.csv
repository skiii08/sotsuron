The Blair Witch Project," Excellent film seen by too many of the wrong people
","I finally saw the film--on video--and it was much better than I had expected!  The premise was creative and original and the execution by the filmmakers was outstanding.I knew it had been victimized by way too much hype--only Bruce Springsteen could survive cover stories by Time and Newsweek on the same week--and I know now that it would have been more 'successful' if the popular media would have ignored it.When a film (especially a quirky one) gets so much attention, some people feel challenged.  So Joe Sixpack and Jane Chablis march into theatres--with their arms folded metaphorically--saying, 'o.k., big shot film, so scare me!' And of course they miss the whole point because they don't understand how to identify with the characters and don't even want to participate in the experience. Too bad for them.I find that for me films are more enjoyable on their own merits if I don't have too much information about them up front.  The overkill hype slathered on this great little film is a good example of it.",Null,0,1,27 February 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Surprisingly entertaining film!
","My wife talked me into seeing it.  Even though I had loved Fargo for its originality, the trailer for O Brother looked too much like 'Dukes of Hazzard' to me.  And, George Clooney?  Give me a break.Well, give it a look.  Tim Blake Nelson is a stitch in one of the three principal roles, and George and John are superb, as well.  If they weren't actually singing, the synching was excellent, and they pulled it off in grand style.  It was one of very few films that caused my wife and me to agree that we could easily walk back into the theatre, pay another fare and watch it again!  That is the highest praise I can give to a film.If you think you should dislike 'hillbilly music,' you'd better stay away, but if you have an open mind and like to be entertained, see it.",Null,0,0,18 January 2001
