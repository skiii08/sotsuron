It," Terrifyingly Marvelous. We all floated down there!
","Stephen King's novel as never seen before... As a fan of Stephen King's novel 'IT' I must say that i was extremely impressed by the movie. Firstly, the WHOLE cast and creative team behind the movie were perfectly chosen. Bill Skarsgard nails the role of Pennywise in way that you kind of sympathize the character. I was never expecting to like a child eater! All of the Losers Club have done an amazing job on maintaining their character in the correct way! Unlike all the other horror movies in the industry, IT delivers a humorous factor to the audience that breaks the horror part of the movie. In result, it really makes the movie more enjoyable. It also has a very sensitive factor. The fact that Bill is dedicated to find his brother Georgie because he thinks that he is the one to be blamed for his death is amazingly well put in the movie.There are still some changes from the book, but lets not forget that a book to a movie adaption is not always the same. All in all, Andy has done an amazing job on this movie and everyone else from cast to crew! Good job! You'll float too!",9,5,10,17 September 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," An extraordinary cinematic experience
","I couldn't be more shocked by a movie. My heart was beating so fast from minute one until the last minute. My legs were shaking after leaving the theater.
It is a thrilling ride with ups and downs (mostly downs). Many people say that it is exhausting because there are too many characters and too many things going on, but you cannot criticize this movie from this factor only. This is the movies nature. It was meant to be like that, to exhaust you until the last minute. On the other hand, there were too many characters but each and every one of them is shown equally with an enormous dynamic for all of them. Also, the scenes that were running simultaneously were masterfully crafted to fit in the story so that everything can end up the way it ended. 
Yes, there were many deaths and many of those deaths made us cry and made us emotionally unstable. But this is the movie, a movie about the possible end of the world. 
Thanos is the best villain that Marvel ever created. He threw Killmonger out of the window. We've seen an extraordinary part of his character. He is not the bad villain that everyone was waiting for. We've seen his good side in many perspectives, his only love. But we've seen what he is capable to do to accomplish his mission.
At last what Avengers: Infinity War has that no other superhero movies has is that ending. Those 10 last minutes that will haunt you forever and you will never forget them. Things take an unexpected turn at those 10 last minutes that you are not only left speechless but you leave the theater with your mouth fully open from surprise and your legs shaking from disbelief. 
It's of course the first part of a two part movie because it leaves you with an enormous cliffhanger but let's not forget May 2019 is not too far away from now.
Thus, this movie is a must see for all the marvel moviegoers and fans but also for people that have some knowledge on the movies background story. The cast and crew of this movie deserve a big applause and an enormous bravo from the entire world. I cannot believe that I've lived to see this movie. I quote what common sense media said 'This is the most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet'",8,1,6,27 April 2018
A Quiet Place," A Monstrous Tense 'Quiet' Ride
","When a Director decides to direct a horror/thriller film he knows that to be successful he needs a great story...well tick that box for sure! From the very beggining to the very end i was hooked on my seat...not to mention the last scene sequence where my mouth couldnt close from what i was watching! Every scene was so masterfully crafted and the story was unveiling slowly,steadily,tensefully as never seen before in a movie! I didnt know that James Krasinski and Emily Blunt were so extraordinary good actors until i saw this movie... I couldnt believe my eyes. Both child actors were amazingly talented too and have a great future ahead of them. As long as the monsters are concerned, well i dont know about you but I've been traumatized and amazed at the same time. I've never seen something so original as this movie.One word can describe this movie: Legendary!A MUST SEE for everyone!!! Well done to everyone involved, a cinematic masterpiece has finally been created and will be remembered for ages to come!",9,7,15,10 April 2018
La La Land," A Classic Romantic Hollywood Mastepiece
","La La Land stands as a cinematic spectacle. 
From the opening scene you can understand that this movie is not messing around, this scene delivers amazing feelings and prepares you for an emotional roller-coaster throughout the film. It is a pure Hollywood love story that has been portrayed by two amazingly talented actors. 
The movie circles around two options. Either choose love or choose dreams. At the end of the film you will surely understand what the two protagonists choose and why they chose it, again shown in a beautiful way. It takes influence from movies like 'Singing in the Rain' and demonstrates some iconic scenes in a new modern way that makes you feel nostalgic about the classic one. It is so perfectly crafted, but what makes this movie unique from any other romantic movies is its ending. That ending. Not only does it deliver some extremely emotional scenes but it changes the whole idea you had for the film. 
Also, in a musical the music needs to be stunning for it to be successful. For the first time in a movie, I have cried so loudly when hearing a song. This soundtrack gives you the feels. It is a masterpiece from song one until the very last song. 
The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an unashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone, wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh, and it's hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one of the best films I've seen in a long while.
Cheers to the dreamers, the men and women behind the making of this musical classic masterpiece.",10,6,7,25 April 2018
