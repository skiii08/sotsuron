Blade Runner 2049," Garbage
","none of the people involved in this film are a Spielberg or Abrams. The people doing this don't know how to entertain and also send a message. Biring. I sat there for 3 hours thinking how much better JJ Abrams would have been in charge of this. Sean Young was great. The chick in this one was not. Scarlet Johansson turned you down, didn't she?Too long and boring.",4,6,18,21 October 2017
Schindler's List," Best film ever
","Many have tried and done very god jobs too (Zookeeper's wife, Life Is Beautiful, Once Upon A Time In America, Fiddler On The roof) but Schindler's List is the undisputed masterpiece of humanity.Whoever directed this is a genius. I suggest you watch it and then watch it again and get copies into your friends hands. It shows the evil done upon God's Chosen people and asks for penance. Sad beyond words.",10,45,80,21 October 2017
