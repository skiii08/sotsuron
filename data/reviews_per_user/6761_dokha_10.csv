Source Code," Fun, new idea, poor storytelling.
","i recently watched source code, limitless, and unknown which i will make a review for each of them. all these movies have something in common i feel the directors try to rush they don't take enough time to explain the complicated concepts and events in which is crucial to understand the movies, they also do not shed enough light on key role characters, in addition the dialog is often vague in which the viewer is not clear on whats happening, in a nutshell the storytelling in all three movies is plain CRAPPY (Unknown not so much), i cant help but feel that most directors are attempting to imitate Christopher Nolan style which i despise (making fairly complicating ideas into hugely complicated through his very bad direction and storytelling and even dialog. in limitless and source code specifically very little information is provided keeping the viewer thinking in order to fill the illogical gaping holes in the technicality of the story and the complicated events revolving around the main character leaving the viewer thinking logically of what or why just happened instead of just enjoying the moment. and this what i don't recognize in older movies i don't feel the movie is an outline or a summary of a longer movie, and i don't feel the compression of the development of incidences during the movie.--Source Code--- the main point i don't like about that movie is the carelessness of explaining the concept behind the source code, they explained it in a very superficial way, i am sure most people wont care, but for me it makes a big difference, especially towards the end it quickens its pace although the end part is the most complicated part, when he sent the sms why didn't she receive it instantly? and when he wrote it how did he know he will continue to live?(as he stated in the sms). i also noticed that every time Stevens returned to the bunker was because he died NOT because the eight minutes were over. so they did an awful job explaining the technicality. also the part where he was freezing and things went wrong in the bunker the screen was broken, i don't get this part at all how did that happen? , this part just doesn't belong in the movie, its just a scene they put there to extend time.",7,2,3,30 June 2011
Fight Club," Oh goody another crazy person movie.
","maybe i have seen too much 'crazy person movies' that are even newer than this film, and this one is not that special. i thought the movie was going great before they made him crazy having double personalitys, and when a movie does that for me it just sinks to that level ; the level of crazy person movies, (and its all been a dream movies too). i was really enjoying it, but it left a negative impression of me in the end . and i don't know why it got a really high mark here on IMDb, maybe its the first of its kind, i don't know, what i do know that if it was unique, its not anymore. what i like about the movie is its dialogue/script deep meaningful, eyeopening and wise.",Null,0,1,28 August 2011
The Prestige," One of the better C.Nolan movies
","i must start by saying i am not a christopher nolan fan, i dislike most of his movies. most of his movies are just over the top with his know nothing to do but jumble the scenes so the people would be more impressed with the outcome in the end when he pours all the important scenes required to understand wat the hell is happening in a random order leaving your brain struggling to arrange the storyline together and forgetting all the details that usually doesn't make sense, quickly ending the movie in a really RUSHED manner, and all that just takes the fun away of any movie [1-develop lots of questions 2- deliver the answers in a highly compressed package 3- End] that wat CN does, and thats why i would never recognize him as one of the great directors like Spielberg, Osborn, Jackson. But in this movie although i did not know at the time CN made it i realized that halfway through and it was confirmed in the end where it was a little too 'Nolany' because they gave as little information/details as possible but was wrapped up nicely (the dark knight syndrome, which i hate BTW.) and i always have to ask my self is it really logical? can this happen in reality? or did he just put all those twists and turns to leave an impression. But in this movie i think it was best that CN direct it because of its nature but again it was a little too much to fully enjoy the movie. i think his brother JN made a good balance, and i feel contrary to many opinions that CN cannot portray/present a story but rather write it, so i don't like him as a director. the story itself was especially priceless because it ended the way i wanted to in favor of chritian bale, the movie was never slow exciting form the start i liked its pace excecpt the last 30 mins where it turned all 'Nolany'. and i need to watch it again to see if it will satisfy my highly logical mind, as there are still some tiny events that is not ironed out.",Null,0,0,11 August 2011
Crash," Stupid ass film
","This film wants to just touch your heart, it doesn't care how to get there it just does it by any means necessary and thats what angers me about this film. OVER dramatic that it is far from realistic reminds me of Babel but babel is so much better and far more real life like. in the first part we seen two African Americans talking completely logical about some racist factors and how stereotypes affect them etc... them suddenly take out their guns and steal a car. so all what they said was completely pointless, and i lost respect for the film in the very beginning and even more as its passed by, it gets so stretched that i didn't even feel any sympathy at the end. so if u are a person of reason just ignore this movie.",2,4,7,26 August 2011
The Transporter," All in all good.. but hard to accept
","The Transporter has an exciting storyline that hardly has any flaws, but the action on the other hand was where all the flaws were. had an awesome first hour, but then last quarter of the movie which was mostly action is FAR FETCHED and unrealistic. i didn't like the way he got rid of the bad guys the manouvers he did especially the last one on the truck when he threw his nemesis out is just physically impossible, also when he was thrown infront of the speeding truck and how the girl killed the armed man in the end to save frank . the action scenes i felt were rushed and far from perfected, also there is too much (hero runs bullets hitting every place except the target, and that what i hate about action movies, because it makes it look cheap and unrealistic) so if i judged based on the action soley it would be another unworthy action flick. as i said this movie makes me take it seriously throughout a big chunk from the beginning thats why i enjoyed the first half better than the last parts, which made me feel like im watching another movie because it didn't live up to the atmosphere set up in the beginning. for me crank 2 was more realistic.",Null,0,0,18 September 2011
Unknown," Fun, but has the same negative traits as other modern movies.
","i recently watched source code, limitless, and unknown which i will make a review for each of them. all these movies have something in common i feel the directors try to rush they don't take enough time to explain the complicated concepts and events in which is crucial to understand the movies, they also do not shed enough light on key role characters, in addition the dialog is often vague in which the viewer is not clear on whats happening, in a nutshell the storytelling in all three movies is plain CRAPPY (Unknown not so much), i cant help but feel that most directors are attempting to imitate Christopher Nolan style which i despise (making fairly complicating ideas into hugely complicated through his very bad direction and storytelling and even dialog. in limitless and source code specifically very little information is provided keeping the viewer thinking in order to fill the illogical gaping holes in the technicality of the story and the complicated events revolving around the main character leaving the viewer thinking logically of what or why just happened instead of just enjoying the moment. and this what i don't recognize in older movies i don't feel the movie is an outline or a summary of a longer movie, and i don't feel the compression of the development of incidences during the movie.---Unknown--- as i gave it a good rating because the negative points never really ruined the experience for me as most movies do, my negative point is the director did not shed enough light and developing the secondary characters, i am talking mainly about Rodney Cole, the part where the German x-spy killed himself and the dealogue between them is not fully explained, and i just feel this part doesn't fit perfectly in the movie, they just put it to add some time and event. i specifically feel that those small important details are crammed in a way which it makes the movie less understandable. like how did the x-spy know martins real past when he said 'what if he remembers everything?'.i cant help but feel this movie is just scene after scene after scene not really interconnected with each other, this may be the most efficient way to shoot a movie but makes the movie less valuable than it potentially is, movies nowadays don't have this heaviness/richness that the good old ones had. and how did the martin Harris-es know the password (i mean the number code itself) to Bressler's work? and what operating system in the world are the using it seems its all the same software in all the movies, id die to use that instead of windows ;)",6,2,4,29 June 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," i never EVE-E-E-E-R espected this movie would be awesome.
","kill bill is set in a twisted reality Japanese manga kinda world. the best thing about the film that we rarely see in others is that they tell the story nice and slowly so that you just enjoy don't have to put the pieces together, true that there's a couple of jumbled scenes and i am not a fan of that because its really doesn't bring any thing to the table story wise but it is not over used. crappy CONS ALTHOUGH THE ACTION AND fighting looked really cool, the camera angels gave it away for me, most of the fighting we see was too zoomed in up close and this takes away the sense of reality and technical possibility to it, that you'd have to replay because you didn't catch wat the hell happened in the last 0.3 seconds.",Null,2,5,27 August 2011
Limitless," Highly compressed movie

1408," Pointless Waste Of Time
","this review may contain what may be considered spoilers. news-flash any good review has to, what would i base my review on then, how can i make the reader convinced by my opinion? how would they know what I'm talking about? u silly IMDb.. i cant believe this mess got a 6.9 on IMDb and the same on RT,i am going there too and write a review, wow people are dumb... i heard this movie was a mess but i like the genre so i still saw it and guess what..IT is A FU*KING MESS. i saw the directors cut which i swear to god is 10x messier than the theatrical. i read the plot of the theatrical and its clear that this was the original best intended cut. i felt they just made the directors for the sake of it and stuffing, with completely different ending, they just wanted the movie to be longer but at the expense of making it CRA*PIER. this is one of those movies that u have to completely turnoff your brain to get entertained, this movie was illogical and unrealistic in the simplest of aspects. i wouldn't be so angry if it didn't get >6 rating. plus i wish john Cusack had better taste in movies, i also watched this movie for him. there's this one scene in the Dcut where they trick u making u thing everything was a dream but then goes back into being a part of the illusion. WHY?! pointless..this whole movie is just pointless and ill never watch a movie from a European director again.",5,0,1,5 February 2011
X-Men: First Class," A positive waste of time..
","So I've been holding on this for so long because i just couldn't swallow the fact that they made an x-men with completely new actors and not to mention a new director, looking up the movie's page here today, i found that the director had made a couple of other good movies so i decided ill just watch it streaming as an independent movie with no ties to the other x-men movies. i have also watched reviews so i knew as a movie it was on the good side.Let me start by saying the vision of this movie in an overhead view is great but the execution is what made this movie mediocre, the same type of problem i see in so many potentially great movies like this one which ends up forgotten and uninspiring. I'm starting to get tired of writing movie reviews and basically saying the same thing over and over. i went into this with low expectations and i have to say in hindsight that probably did help a lot; me not getting disappointed. A choppy storyline, incredibly stupid humor (i smiled maybe once in the movie), pacing that forces you to shut your mind off in order to enjoy the movie, pacing that of which only people with ADD would satisfy, come think of it the guy who made this movie probably has ADD. and script that is more pretentious than fake teeth, not to mention shallow and at times, bouncy as if you're watching Gilmore Girls. this movie is FILLED with one-liners so brace yourself for THAT. And having finished it i will probably forget in in T-minus 2 days, but i want to stress that thats a good level relatively for the movies i see coming out in recent years. Id give it a 7 (according to todays standards) , but not one decimal more.",7,0,1,16 January 2013
