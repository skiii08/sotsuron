Come and See," Pochemy
","Come and See is an incredible tribute to World War II and had political implications in 1985 when it as made. The constant chaos within the movie is symbolic for what could have happened back in 1985. A nuclear war could have broken out and engulfed the entire world in the same type of destruction that was demonstrated in the movie. It would really be a total war. One of the downsides of the movie is its bias. It shows the entire German army as villainous an heartless. The only signs of emotion are shown to simply make the movie more believable. The Soviet troops in actuality were probably just as brutal as the Germans since both sides were pulling out all the stops. However, since this movie is a tribute to the defeat of the Germans, it is indeed logical to make them look as atrocious as they were shown.",9,1,1,1 August 2010
