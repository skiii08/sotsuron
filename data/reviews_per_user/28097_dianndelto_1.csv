Despicable Me 2," Minions everywhere!
","This movie is better than the original, but not because of story line. This movie is just FUNNY! We got to see it in the early screening and my very hyper 1 year old didn't say a word in the entire movie. Hubby cried... Because he laughed so hard! The storyline is very predictable but the minions made this movie! And the end was probably the most emotional funny part of the entire movie. I must confess myself I cried because you can truly emotionally relate to the characters but it was also funny. Wait for the boy band moment! Lol no spoilers though, go see it! :) you won't regret it. And bring your tissue papers because you will need it! Awesome job universal, truly looking forward to a 3rd installment!",10,7,12,30 June 2013
