Changeling," Awful
","Sometimes you need to see an awful film to allow you to compare against all of the other films that you watch. This film was truly awful.The story and script were lazy. If you dress a movie up with great period scenes, including streetcars etc, you can get away with some errors and low quality. Even that doesn't help.I found myself shouting at the TV asking why the Police would do what they did and why the mother would do what they did.I actually found that whole thing a bit embarrassing to watch. Angelina Jolie's acting seems to get worse with each film and John Malkovich can only play one character it seems.Give this bad film a miss unless you are happy to see clich√©s coming at you from all over the place.I had intended to give it 1 out of 10, but instead gave 2 for the set showing the Los Angeles of the 1920's.",2,9,16,26 November 2010
