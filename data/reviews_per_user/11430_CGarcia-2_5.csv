The Blair Witch Project," The best horror movie of 1999, and it DIDN'T come out of Hollywood...thank god!
","What can you say about The Blair Witch Project that hasn't been said about such pioneer, breakthrough horror movies such as Night of the Living Dead, The Exorcist or Texas Chainsaw Massacre...Simply put, the movie is an 'accidental' work of genius...Yes I know the directors came up with this plot, but when you consider the fact that the actors were not only acting, but improvising the storyline along the way, while also being the camera people, sound people and lighting people for the project...that simply makes this movie the most brilliant independent horror movie ever to be made...Only time will see this movie as such, however...take a look at the list of movies we call 'classics' today, and see how many of them were hated by critics when they first came out...Fantasia, Vertigo, Psycho, 2001 A Space Odyssey...the list goes on...The sad part of the story isn't so much how many people hate The Blair Witch Project, as it is the fact of WHY they hate it...It doesn't spoonfeed the horror to you...If you need Hollywood special effects to come at you and go BOO in order to scare you, then Blair Witch is not for you...If you have an open mind, and like to use your imagination, then you will love it...Unfortunately, most of today's audience might just not get it...this isn't their own fault, however, since Hollywood has been feeding the audiences so many bland computer effects for the past few years, that today's kids never really learned what REAL horror is all about...I look at it this way...If having a camera aimed at someone who's listening to Orson Welles' 1939 broadcast of 'War of the World' would intrigue you, then you will definitely love The Blair Witch Project, since its mental stimulation goes far more than any movie made today...However, if you're the type who says 'War of the World', Yuck....then forget it...Blair Witch Project relies on us using our imaginations, and allowing us to 'think' about the horror...'what isn't seen is alot scarier than what is', something that Hollywood forgot along time ago, and unfortunately has desensitized today's audience into becoming nothing more than living robots, not able to use their own minds anymore.",8,1,2,26 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," If you have no imagination, then you'll hate Blair Witch Project!
","I loved it...then again I'm 39 years old...I come from a generation where special effects in films were rare, and only used to emphasize a part of the story...Today if a movie doesn't have computer effects, it can't scare you...well guess what? Computer effects put me to sleep...but I thank god for my imagination, it makes me appreciate this little psychological horror film for the mini classic it is...I bet most people here who are ridiculing BWP probably have never heard Orson Welle's radio broadcast of War of the Worlds...and if you DID hear it, you probably thought it was boring, made you fall asleep...I pity today's culture because you have all been brainwashed by Hollywood into believing good horror=great computer effects...No...I do something called 'thinking', that's how I decided Hollywood's computer MTV Exorcist ripoff 'Stigmata' stunk, while the Exorcist WAS scary...why? It's a thinking man's film...so is Blair Witch Project, the best Indy horror film of the 90's...oh and to those who think Evil Dead was the greatest thing since sliced bread...think again, it's just a bad ripoff of the Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with alot more gore....gore isn't scary...a thinking movie is...Kudos to everyone involved with the Blair Witch Project...You guys took me back to when horror movies WERE scary!",8,0,1,27 September 1999
Vertigo," My favorite movie of alltime!
","I have seen ALOT of movies in my life, but none have moved me the way Vertigo has...It's simply brilliant...the more times one views it, the more one picks up from it...a true masterpiece from the master himself...When I think Vertigo, I think the colors red and green...when I think Vertigo I think obsession with love, and the film itself...This movie is so deep that you could write a thesis on it and keep adding to it from time to time...Hitchcock really gave his all in this picture...it's about the ultimate love...wanting to achieve the ultimate love, and, as happens in life, never having love turn out to be the way we want it to be...all star performances by Stewart, Novak and Bel Geddes make this visually stunning masterpiece a true film classic...Newly restored, the DVD version simply blows you out of the water....I have seen the movie about 20 times now, and everytime I love it more...Vertigo is the ultimate cult film for me, as I keep going back to it more and more...considering it's dark storyline, it must be a glut for punishment, but Hitch only keeps me wanting more....10 stars...only because I can't give it 100 stars!",10,254,401,25 August 1999
Vertigo," Probably the most beautifully haunting movie ever made!
","Vertigo is one of those masterpieces that you either get, or you don't...If you get it, like I do, you will find yourself watching it over and over, discovering new shots within shots, subplots, and falling deeper in love with Kim Novak upon each viewing...This movie makes me wish I lived back in the 50's, when everything looked like a dream...the cars, the scenery, the landscape, the costumes...Vertigo is a timeless classic that you can admire over and over...Kind of like going to a museum and staring at 'Portrait of Carlotta' time and time again!",10,3,5,5 September 1999
The Matrix," Great special effects does not a great movie make!
","What can be said about The Matrix that hasn't already been said about every other 90s MTV generation movie? You want special effects? You got it! You want action? You got it! You want violence? You got it! You want loud? You got it! You want characters you'll like? Um, look elsewhere! You want emotion in those characters? Um, look elsewhere! You want to root for the good guy? Um, look elsewhere! Let's face it. Today action movies rely on alot of bullets and computer generated effects, and acting is put on the back burner...Is it any wonder that most characters in the Matrix look and sound as if they got the typical Generation X labotomy before the cameras rolled? So robots are, yet again, at war with the humans who created them. I think The Terminator did it better, even a monotone Arnold shows more emotion than Keanu Reeves. The plot itself takes us into a dark world of reality that tells us our 'real' world isn't real at all. Who would want to live in that dark world anyway? Why bother to fight the battle at all? I mean any logical person would rather live in this world we've been lied about, as opposed to the dark world that represents reality, and shows no hope for mankind. Something happened to motion pictures about 15 or 20 yrs ago. Fun science fiction programs like the original Star Trek, hammy acting, Romper Room props and all, made way for The Next Generation and brain dead acting, with the scripts to match...Somehow, society has been brainwashed into believing anything with great special effects is worthy of high praise. Sorry folks, I've been around for many yrs, and I know a classic when I see one. The Matrix is just more of the same, throw in a man vs. robot story, alot of gunfire, special effects and martial arts, and Hollywood will have another hit...They were right, but unfortunately, many of us have seen it all done much better before...Terminator's script blows away this rehash. The worst of the Bruce Lee movies gave us REAL kung fu magic(not some computer generated effects that mocks our intelligence). Next time, how about making us care about the characters a little, have a woman cry in a man's arms. Make us believe these people FEEL...Maybe then we'll find ourselves rooting for Keanu, instead of the robots. 6 stars out of 10. Mostly for special effects, that by now only contribute to put us to sleep.",6,0,1,3 January 2001
