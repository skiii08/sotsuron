Alien 3," Surprisingly very good.
","Most movies that are made into trilogies without being written as such in the first place usually degenerate into crap, no matter how good the idea was to start out with.  Take the Terminator trilogy for instance (though it must be admitted that the second one was pretty cool).  Alien, however, is not one of those trilogies.  The first and the second are different enough that the movies each remain interesting.  And the third one, amazingly enough, does the same thing.  Unlike most of the movie series put out by Hollywood, there is enough to do with the Alien storyline that there can conceivably be more than one movie.  Alien 3 is an often underrated sci-fi film, as it hearkens back to the first one.  However, it also does several things the first two do not in terms of character embellishment and suspense.  In addition, it provides beautiful visual effects (if the word 'beautiful' can be connected to a sci-fi/horror monster).  The acting isn't incredible, but it's not bad, and the ending ties things up nicely, finishing the series in a satisfactory way.  If only the producers had recognized that before they made the fourth one, which is tripe.",7,1,3,13 December 2003
The Big Lebowski," High-larious!
","The Coen brothers' 'The Big Lebowski' is perhaps the most entertaining film I have seen in a long time.  This film is a ludicrous parody of mistaken-identity movies, and I mean that in a good way.  Clever, visually appealing, and having an engaging soundtrack, 'The Big Lebowski' is the perfect movie to watch when bored, in class, under the influence of some controlled substance, or all of the above.  I find that I can watch it at any time and love it.  I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone with a quirky, random sense of humor and a taste for absurdity.  Above all, it will make you want to go bowling.  Thumbs up.",8,0,1,30 September 2003
Signs," Signs is definitely overrated.
","CAUTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSWhen I went into the theater to see this movie, I was expecting an X-Files-esque alien story, with lots of shadow play and psychological suspense.  I thoughtthere would be a lot more buildup from the crop circles than there is.  I was disappointed. Signs has potential, but that's all there is.  This movie tries to be a family story, a sci-fi thriller, and an underdog-overcoming-the-odds tale.  Each of these genres has its merits, but not when spliced together.  Signs has many good points, such as the first, say, half an hour.  Unfortunately, M. Night Shyamalan tries to do too much with it.  In the course of the movie, I started to care less and less about the characters.  I didn't care about their fears and past misfortunes, and I certainly didn't care what became of them.  I also began noticing more than a fewinconsistencies in the plot, not to say blatant hypocrisies.  WARNING:SPOILERS ARE APPROACHING!  First of all, if the aliens melt when they touchwater, wouldn't the nighttime dew in the cornfields kill them?  What about the fact that water vapor is in the air?  Wouldn't their skin melt?  Why are they kidnapping creatures that are 80 percent water?  Why are they attacking aplanet which has two thirds of its surface covered in water?  Another problem I have with the monsters is that they have mastered interstellar travel, yet they can't figure out how to break into a boarded-up house.  Finally, (SPOILER!SPOILER!) one of these supposedly advanced beings gets beaten by a guyswinging a baseball bat.  A freakin baseball bat!!!  Has anyone even heard of guns?  Why didn't the army try shooting them, for God's sake?  My majorproblem with Signs, however, was the interjection of mushy spiritual crap atmoments of suspense.  Family film parts absolutely kill suspense, and beat its corpse with a stick. As I say, there are good parts of this film, but the director should stick to doing one thing at a time, and not try to please everyone all at once.",3,1,1,19 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Glorious.
","Glorious.  Simply glorious.  There are no words which can describe the extent to which this film is awesome.  As a true fan and die-hard follower of the books, I was astounded by the perfection of the first, impressed by (though slightlydisappointed in) the second, and blown away by the third.  The highestcompliment I can give this movie is that it does for The Return of the King what the first movie did for the Fellowship of the Ring.  I think, were he alive, Tolkein would be proud of the epic wonder instilled in this movie.I don't have time or space to describe all the ways in which this film is wonderful, but I will name a few.  First of all, the feeling of urgency in the whole thing kept me on the edge of my seat.  There is the sense that the war could be lost at any moment.  All during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields there is a weight of utter despair, the feeling that against such might there can be no victory.  In contrast, the total and complete wonder of the battle is incredible.  I spent my childhood fondly imagining gigantic medieval wars, and now that there is the technology to create them on the screen, I am in heaven.  When the Rohirrim charge thehordes of orcs, I literally teared up, and I never, ever cry during  a movie.  It was just so incomprehesibly awesome that I couldn't do anything else.  Finally, my very favorite thing that Jackson has done with this story is the ending. Perfectly true to the mood of the book, there is a wistful sadness to it that again made me tear up.  SPOILER  SPOILER SPOILER   And the last shot, a view of a hobbitdoor closing as Sam goes inside his house, visually represents the realmeaning of the book and of the story: that despite the size and all- encompassing importance of the war and of the quest, all of it really boils down to saving something that simple.",9,0,0,29 December 2003
