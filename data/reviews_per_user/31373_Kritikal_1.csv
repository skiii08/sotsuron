The Blair Witch Project," Scariest thing I've ever watched
","Another example how a good story is more scary than any big budget horror/effects movie. The movie generates raw primal fear in the audience.  Darkness, solitude, the occult, dissapearances, the unkown are what produce the claustrophobic response to this movie.Go see it for yourself before blowing $7.50 on a pathetic piece of CGI like 'The Haunting'.  Personally, I don't think I'm going to go running in the woods behind my house for the next year or so.",10,1,2,27 July 1999
