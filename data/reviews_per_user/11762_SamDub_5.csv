Marie Antoinette," Absolutely fantastic!
","I finally got to see Marie Antoinette last week in Paris. My expectations were very high and I must say that I was not a bit disappointed. Everything is perfect. The acting... the costumes... the sets in Versailles. I especially loved Judy Davis' performance. Absolutely fantastic, one of the best supporting performances I have seen in a good while. Kirsten Dunst was very good, I cannot really see another actress in this role anymore. Marianne Faithful gave a good performance as Maria Theresa and Asia Argento was also great as the slutty Madame DuBarry. I could go on for hours about how much I loved this movie. Shame it's not going to be on in the UK until next year. Hopefully the DVD will come out in France later this year. Well done, Sofia!",10,6,20,10 June 2006
Troy," Yaaaaaawwwwwn!!!
","I never fall asleep in the cinema. Today must have been the first time in YEARS that this has happened. And I had a good nights sleep when I woke up this morning. I don't know what it is, but something is just missing. The whole movie is just dire. It's too long and this howling singing in nearly every scene was just too much. Some of the dialogues were just laughable and is it only me, or is anyone else wondering why a Greek princess has a German accent? Everyone else managed a quite generic accent but she just couldn't do it and it stood out in a negative way. Ms Kruger should have tried harder or the accent coach they have hired was useless. No no no, after seeing this I just felt let down. Wait for 'The Day after Tomorrow' by fellow German director Emmerich and give this a pass. Seriously.You've blown it again, Wolfgang.",4,3,6,16 May 2004
The Village," Solid.
","Well, I don't understand why everybody's going on about how they sussed out the plot within like five minutes into the movie. I didn't.... and I am glad I didn't, because I actually enjoyed the plot.This is a different Shyamalan and I think people have a problem with that.Bryce Howard was absolutely astonishing in her role as Ivy Walker. All the other cast was very good, too.I enjoyed every second of this and thought it was great. Don't listen to all the senseless blabbering on here. Most people just form their opinion about what others say. Judging by how people can never shut up in the cinema, I believe that most people who didn't like this, simply didn't understand it or just 'expected something different'.Message to those: go and see Exorcist:The Beginning or even Alien Vs Predator.",9,0,0,27 August 2004
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Boring
","Why is this film supposed to be so great? Why on earth was it awarded with the Palme D'Or???Coming from Ireland myself I was looking forward to learning something new about that period of time and see a gripping, well scripted and acted film. The outcome, however, was rather poor.The performances ranged from average to absolutely appalling and everything else was pretty underwhelming, too. I was very disappointed with this film. Don't waste your time with it, you might be better off reading some good literature about the Irish war of independence.",1,23,53,29 June 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," Loved every second!
","Fair enough, Supremacy IS different than Identity but is this a bad thing? I personally loved every second from the beginning to the end.This is what I really want to see in the cinema. Good, fast-paced, action-packed entertainment with a great cast and great location shots.Cannot wait for the DVD. Will be a great addition I will be watching over and over again.Hopefully they will come up with an equally good or even better sequel to THE BOURNE SUPREMACY.By the way, this is the first time I really ever enjoyed the performance of Joan Allen in a film. She was great.",10,4,6,27 August 2004
