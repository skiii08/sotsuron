Iron Man 3," Fun, But the real iron man is not there
","Iron man 3 has so many high points, At the same time this is not my TONY STARK. This is not a real iron man,Its difficult to pick a favorite.The movie is filled with fun moments. But not a real iron man filmThe cast expectedly rocks.It is a perfect summer blockbuster with comedy and jaw-dropping stunts galore, Go ahead, and indulge in some heavy-duty movie magic as thingsare only getting hotter with the star trek sequel around the corner.We can safely assume that the talented Mr.Downey Jr.would be around for a couple more outings.ONE OF THE lake in iron man3 IS. The music of AC/DC ,(And one more point I THINK DR,ROBERT DOWNEY JR ENDS HIS TONY STARK JOURNEY WITH 3RD INSTALLMENT OF IRON MAN,RDJ THROWED THE ARC INTO THE SEARDJ DESTROYED ALL THE Armores.I AM SO SAD. I THINK ONLY HAPPY HOGAN IS BEST FILM MAKER FOR IORNMAN.( PART 1 AND 2 BOTH ARE BLOCKBUSTER)WITH OUT THE ARC TONY TELLING THAT HE IS IRON MANNO RDJ. REALLY I CANT SLEEP. WHERE IS UR POWER. WHERE IS UR STYLE'I HOPE AND PRAY RDJ WILL COME BACK TO THE MORE SEQUELS OF IRON MAN",8,3,6,29 April 2013
