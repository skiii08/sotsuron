Lucky Number Slevin," Genuinely entertaining movie
","I saw about 3 previews for this movie on TV before it came out and i debated whether to go see it because it looked like one of those movies that could be pretty good but just as easily been really bad. So it just ended up slipping my mind until i saw it to rent in blockbuster a few months later and i immediately grabbed it.Im glad that i did. It turned out to be a very good movie. The story lines were very well done, the acting was pretty good and it was just a good story. I also like movies with a particular style, like when you know that someone made it their own, like tarantinos movies, and jim jarmusch's movies. And i felt a great amount of special style in this movie. I really hope this director continues to make his movies his way.Lucky Number Slevin was just an all around enjoyable movie to watch, and you'll definitely find yourself watching it more than once. Go rent it and you'll probably end up wanting to buy it. go get this movie. 8 stars from me",8,1,2,29 June 2007
3:10 to Yuma," excellent and exciting
","Nice to finally see a decent modern western bring its way to the screen. Much in the style of westerns of old, lots of action, but it doesn't move too quickly where all your seeing is shootouts and blood. The storyline is deep and powerful, all the characters are interesting and make sense, and just an overall enjoyable film.James Mangold puts himself on the board with this film, hopefully he continues to pump out future classics such as 3:10 to Yuma.Go out and watch this in theaters, and then buy it on DVD when it comes out. A movie well worth watching.8.5 from me, which fortunately for 3:10 to Yuma, rounds up to a 9.",9,120,223,11 September 2007
Shaun of the Dead," I really didn't see what everyone else was seeing I guess
","Well, I'm not sure what everybody saw in this movie. I borrowed it from a friend, and he said 'oh man this is like my favorite movie all time.' and i watched it, and i didn't even know what to think. I couldn't tell if it was trying to be like, a big joke, some kind of parody, or if it was trying to be serious. He starts off by beating zombie people with a cricket mallet or whatever you want to call it, and then it turns more serious, and his mom gets infected and he is forced to shoot her. And then at the end, his best friend who is a zombie is locked away in his shed to be friends. I really couldn't find the main idea of the movie, but i guess its appealing to some people. But if your looking for some kind of action/gore movie, i'd rather get lord of the rings or gladiator.",4,5,11,11 March 2007
Hot Fuzz," over rated
","thats basically what it is, over rated.i thought shaun of the dead was over rated, same goes for Hot Fuzz. It has its moments, some funny, some cool fighting clips, but overall it just added up to a mediocre action flick. the story line was pretty weak it tried a little mystery aspect and did NOT pull it off.The directing was interesting which is where most of my 7 stars went, he definitely has a certain style in his films which is new and exciting, he just needs the right story and right approach. Using his talents to portray and tell the story of an underground murder cult in a small town just didn't do it for me.It had the same smart quirky humor as Shaun Of the Dead, and the same bloody outcome for most of the characters, but all in all, it was weak.I can feel Edgar Wright, hes about to bust through, maybe with one more crack at the old movie game and he'll come out with something truly original. I still have hope for him, might as well rent this just to see his progression and be ready for something new and even better.5 of my stars goes to the directing style, and 1.5 goes to the effort, unfortunately there are no half stars so i have to round up. 7 stars from me on a moderately entertaining film, that is not worth buying except for the true Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg fans.",7,0,1,30 August 2007
Snatch," Fun, Fast, and down right cool
","Snatch is definitely much better than Ritchies first movie 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and is one of the most underrated films ever. I don't know why no one has ever seen this movie, its gotta be up there with some of the funnest, and most creative movies ever. Its fast the whole time, you never get bored, it has a good mix of action and dialogue. Its one of the coolest movies you'll ever see. Go out, rent it, and then buy it. Its better than any other below the belt action movies you can get. Its funny, smart, and there is really no other movie like it. The acting is good, story is even better, Ritchie is one of the best new directors and everyone should go out and see his movies. Go out and buy this movie before it disappears, you wont be sorry",10,8,13,15 June 2007
Transformers," an overall entertaining movie
","when you think about what to expect walking into a movie like transformers, its basically what you get. There's no fancy dialogue or complex story lines, its just a fun movie with lots of action. The battle scenes are very cool and well done, and every time you see a Transformer move and fight, its a sight to be had.There is mild humor throughout the movie that seems to fit right in at the right point. Not sloppily done. The special effects of course are great and very exciting, i'm not sure if it was released in i-max but it should be. Im sure kids will love this movie, and it will become an instant kid classic.So when your thinking about a good movie to go out and see with your 12 or 13 year old child, this movie is perfect. Its lots of fun and it has lots of action. A nice little flavor blast for a worn out movie goer.7 from me.",7,2,5,7 July 2007
Children of Men," Frightening and Terrific
","I really had never heard of this movie until i read it in the paper, and the local movie reviewer (Dan DiNicola) gave it an A- which is outstanding from his standpoint. I don't normally agree with his grades and taste in movies but i figured i'd give it a try because i had liked previous Alfonso Cuaron movies. And i'm happy to say it was well worth the hour trip to the nearest theater playing it. It was informative and it had a dangerous portrayal of our near future. It really made me think after I watched it. Clive Owen gives a very strong performance and has etched himself in my mind of new up and coming actors that will be legends in the end. Cuaron also made this movie very well, mixing in the right amount of drama and suspense to keep me interested. There were some very memorable scenes, like the birth scene in the old hotel room. One that has reached the top of the charts in my book. Over all a very fulfilling experience, and very much worth watching for any fan of movies.",9,2,6,13 April 2007
Black Snake Moan," If you liked Hustle & Flow...
","then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man. The story had heart, and was very influential.The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except took a new spin and used the Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. He also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes.No doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie, and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.Go out and rent this movie.",9,1,4,23 July 2007
Grindhouse," Fresh And Exciting
","When i first walked in to see Grindhouse i was kind of expecting a bloody outtake on the old movies, a kind of, shaun of the dead kind of thing. The first movie, Planet Terror by Robert Rodriguez kind of played along to it. It was fun, and bloody, and funny in some parts, but altogether, nothing earth shattering. There were some pretty good fighting scenes and the over all show was enjoyable. After watching the first one, and reading numerous reviews that said the first part was much better than the second by Tarantino, I wasn't overly excited to stay. But being a dedicated QT fan i had to stay. And i will say, i was pleasantly surprised. It starts out a little slow but then quickly picks up speed. It has all the same characteristics of a QT film, witty conversation, and odd ball acting etc. But almost a new element of excitement. He masters the suspense and tension in this film. Your always on the edge of your seat, anticipating the next scene. A long car chase scene, that i wont go in to detail about, but, it brings the same dramatic excitement as the drug over dose scene in Pulp Fiction, and the Torture scene of Reservoir Dogs. And at the end, i found i enjoyed Tarantinos Death Proof much more than Planet Terror, but when i walked out of the theatre, i felt fulfilled, and just a little more bad ass than i felt walking in.",9,1,4,12 April 2007
Pulp Fiction," Truly a movie, that can never be surpassed
","Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movie ever created. Tarantinos abilities as a movie director and writer reach their climax in this intense emotional epic. The movie uses dialogue and emotion that leaves you breathless afterwards. And after you have watched it several times, you can go back and realize. There is nothing fancy about it, ill use the drug overdose scene as an example. There is no music, barely any sound effects, no highly technical camera operations, and yet, its one of the most exciting and energetic scenes in all of cinema. The realness of every scene is amazing. Its hard to imagine what it would be like to have an overdosed dieing girl in your house, and trying to give her an adrenaline shot before she croaks, but after watching this movie, you realize what it would be like. Samuel L. Jackson gives his best performance by far, and Travolta is also perfect for his role. it seems like everything that directors and movie makers try to accomplish and put together, are in this movie. everything thing fits in perfectly, creating a visual masterpiece. If you don't like this movie, you don't like movies at all.",10,0,2,8 April 2007
300," THE coolest movie I have ever seen
","Take Sin City, and Lord Of The Rings, and mash them together, and you get 300. Some of the most entertaining and exhilarating battle scenes in all of film history. The special effects are awesome, the battle sequences are awesome, the story is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome. I also heard that it follows the actual story line very closely, so for you history buffs, it has an appealing taste for you as well, besides the giant elephants and the kind of random goat person. The point is, this movie is fun for everyone, (except for the little kiddies) There are lots of decapitations, and body parts being hacked off. But it really reflects how battles were and the fierceness of these people. I read somewhere that during Napoleon's era, when he was sweeping across Europe, Sparta was still and underground city type thing, and Napolean was too scared to even go near them. And i think that, that feeling comes through in this movie, the actors and director do an incredible job of showing how powerful and united they were. There was also a lot of good filming. Lots of very close ups and interesting angles and perspectives. I would also recommend, if there is any i-max nearby, make the extra effort to go see it. I drove 3 and a half hours to watch it, and it was definitely well worth the drive. If your going to see the movie, see it right. So if you plan on goinbg to see any movies this year, this is the one to see, it is just action packed, pure awesomeness and down right COOL.",10,1,7,10 March 2007
Jackie Brown," Solid and entertaining
","It almost feels like Jackie Brown was made before Pulp Fiction. It feels like you are watching a young Tarantino movie, a less developed director. Don't get me wrong, its a very good movie, good acting, good story, the script is nicely put together. It just didn't pack quite the same punch as Pulp Fiction. I'd say its below reservoir dogs and pulp fiction on the list of Tarantino movies but better than the kill bill series. But any Tarantino fan should get this movie, and fan of a good, old-fashioned, fun caper movie. Samuel L. Jackson has a very cool character with a few memorable lines and scenes, and robert deniro adds a nice little flavor to the movie. All in all, not tarantinos best work, but definitely a good movie. 8 out of 10 from me,",8,0,1,17 June 2007
