The Blair Witch Project," Blair CRAP project
","Here's the truth about the 'Blair Witch', it's not real! All the hype had me believing that it was a real documentary they found in the woods. That's the only reason why anyone went to see this pile of steaming crap is they convinced us all it was real. This is a good example on how good marketing can make a bad movie a hit even when it doesn't deserve to be. I mean no wonder all those Blair Witch parodies came out so soon after the original, it deserved to be ridiculed, it was that bad. Nothing happens, 90 minutes or whatever the length is of nothing. By the half way point I was almost asleep. By the way, lame twist at the end also. There is no Blair Witch ghost, it's an escaped mental patient who murders them all. That's it. It's not scary, I've read scarier fairy tales then this way. Don't waste your time on the BLAIR CRAP PROJECT! I give it the Turkey!",1,1,5,3 November 2007
The Legend of Bagger Vance," A legendary movie
","Returning ten years after the end of World War I a Golfer is talked into a big game but to war stress Rannulph has lost his swing, when Rannulph meets a stranger named Bagger Vance. Who agrees to coach him back onto the old saddle. Although a drama, I was surprised to be saying this, but I liked it. Slow paced but stellar performances, Will Smith earned a best support actor Oscar. There's a Rap Star that can act, which is more then I can say about 'Busta Ryhmes' or 'DMX' whose idea of acting is yelling their lines. But this isn't about the Rappers that can't act, this is about the one that can, let's hear it for Will Smith. DRAMA, COLOR, PG A-",8,1,3,1 September 2005
Gremlins," Parents should read more about movies before taking their kids.
","This is the movie that caused PG-13, because all the parents didn't pay attention to the reviews or the trailers and just saw a cutesy movie. They took their kids to it to find it's a monster movie where people drop like flies. So, they threw a **** storm to end all **** storms and PG-13 was born. Of course this didn't happened in Japan when Gremlins was just another movie. This is the kind of 'violence' they should to five year old on Sailor Moon, they don't hide death from children, it's stupid. We're 'protecting' our children to death in this country and I say it's enough. Time we were more like Japan and I would start by disbanding the PTA, considering it's not improving our schools any, like it was designed to do, instead they complain about movies and TV. Dispand the PTA today! Anyway, the movie was good but I prefer Polly Holiday as the nice person, not the evil Banker lady. I give GREMLINS...9 STARS!",9,0,2,17 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A long time ago, in a prequel not so far away.
","Now some 'true' Star Wars fans were disappointed in this new series of movies, while I say their idiots. They were still sore over the redo on the old Star Wars movies and I say they were stupid about that to. I thought the older movies had flaws that needed fixing. How can anyone like effect errors? Anyway, about the Phantom Menace. Jar Jar Binks was annoying at times, but comedy relief can get a little annoying at times plus, sometimes it was hard to understand him at times. But basically I did like Jar Jar. He has a good heart, clumsy, but a good heart. The early years of Anakin Skywalker is interesting. But I think Greg Proops did a great job as the English speaking alien announcer of the Pod Race. 91/2 STARS. The star chart doesn't do half stars.",9,2,6,24 March 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Don't lose your head
","Okay, right off the bat. I am a tad disappointed about the re-write on the classic characters in this story. Everybody knows that Icabod Crane was a school teacher. No body mention that this was the son or nephew of another Icabod who died here. So I must assume that it's the Icabod from the original story. Anyway, with that said I do like the environment, the spooky atmosphere. But like some movies that are all atmosphere, Sleepy Hollow has lots of substance, frights, gore effects, clever lines. Despite the change in the story, it actually works, plus it's CSI: COLONIAL, that was clever. Yes, I got to admit. This is a good movie and worthy of attention. 9 STARS.",9,1,2,31 March 2007
Silent Hill," Stayed fateful to the video game
","Okay, my brother has played two of the four video games in this series and I watched them as he played them. This adaptation of the video games stays fateful to the video game. They created new characters, but some of the situation is similar to the first video game. The acting and the effects are incredibly cool. I love the creature effects and the story does work. Now there are some character issues. Like the Rose character in my book is a bit of a wussy, all she does is scream and scream. The characters in the games would kick ass, not scream like a four year old. Also, without giving it away, the climax of the movie is confusing and somewhat disappointing. Let's hope that they pick it up in the next movie. 8 STARS.",8,3,6,31 March 2007
"I, Tonya"," The Motion Picture Academy got it right for once.
","For once the Motion Picture Academy got it right, this deserve the best picture win but it didn't actually win which means the people picking has more brains over the people voting. Is it perfect, no. It has pacing issues, mild pacing issues. It's funny, heart breaking and interesting.",9,0,1,15 March 2019
The Polar Express," A wondrous new kind of animation
","Wonderous, marvelous, stupendous animation. Like nothing I've seen before, and Tom Hanks playing all those roles. The story is cool, the characters are cool. The ghost hobo is cool. Let's face it almost nothing is wrong with this movie. My only complaint is minor and I think the children would be less creepy if they had names. Look at the credit listing, it says thing like HERO BOY and KNOW-IT-ALL. These are names the script gave them. I would think to make them more well rounded characters the one thing they would been first is a name. I'm just saying. But that is so minor it didn't even effect the grade I'm giving it. The animation and the Tom Hanks is the main attraction and the main appeal of the Polar Express and I hope this new kind of motion capture is around a long, long time. 10 STARS.",10,3,6,9 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Perfect Prequel
","This is a perfect prequel, I'm glad that Lucas didn't give in to the nay sayers and quit on Jar Jar Binks. I for a party of one like Jar Jar, even if he's not always understandable. Now let's move on to effects, they are perfect as well. The same Nay Sayers are complaining that Lucas destroyed the 'purity' of the original films by creating these prequels. But if they were as devoted as they claim, then they would have known that Lucas planned this all along. The new characters are great, Christopher Lee is always menacing and as Darth Tyranus, he is really menacing. I really can't say anything bad about Star Wars, I have been a fan since it first came out when I was just a kid, but I'm not narrow minded like some and I love this new set of movies. I give EPISODE II a perfect 10 STARS.",10,1,3,19 May 2007
"I, Robot"," Asimov adaptation
","Where to begin? How about those effects, were they assume or what? I can't tell you how real the robots look in this movie and not robot suits, no way anyone could be in those robots. Plus, I think Will Smith does a great job at Del, the one man who doesn't have complete faith in the system makes the best cops. Asimov's story translates well to the big screen and if you ask me, I think this is a great adaptation of the book. The acting is superb and if you ask me, this was the best picture of 2004 not whatever drama won. As per the norm, the sci-fi is ignored by the academy, I mean this had dramatic scenes between Del and Sonny. It had Oscar winning Oscar, but for a few minor exceptions the sci-fi and horror genre is ignored by the 'academy'. They rather pick boring dramas that you can care less about. I think it's time to clean up the rating board and the fossils in the academy. But as the story goes I think it was cool an worth watching. 9 STARS.",9,0,1,27 January 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A great mystery
","A great mystery as always. Who is Silas Black, what is he real connection to Voldermort, did he commit the crimes he committed? These are the questions Harry, Hermione and Ron must solve in order to find the truth and save Harry from the killer and the Dementors who seems to have a sick obsession with him. They attacked Harry every change they got, what was that all about? The Dementors have got to be the scariest monsters in the HARRY POTTER universe and one I would never want to meet in the flesh. Now this is allot darker then the first two and really little kids around five or six might find it too scary. But kids 7 and older can handle this scariness of this one. The effects and characters are up to the others in the series. A welcome edition to the HARRY POTTER library and I think I'll give it....9 STARS.",9,0,1,15 September 2006
Aliens," Hail the coming of the ALIENS
","The second movie has a lot more punch and excitement then the first. While the first was creepy space atmosphere waiting for something to jump out and eat you, this was all out ass kicking fun. Not the first movie wasn't good, I love all the alien movies, some more then others and for various reasons. But if I had to pick a favorite and say this is the best of the series, I would have to say this movie. James Cameron starts in full speed and don't stop until a great explosive climax that is worthy of me. The story is great, now for the bad news. Some of the human characters did get a little annoying at times, just a little, mind you. But that's a small thing. 9 STARS",9,1,4,28 July 2007
Independence Day," Best damn invasion movie!
","The best damn movie about aliens attack during the fourth of July weekend ever. The only movie about aliens invading during the fourth of July weekend, just kidding. One of the best alien invasion movies ever. Not a buried treasure, this movie is almost as big as Titanic. There's this speech near the end by the President, best damn inspirational speech I ever heard. Made me feel like jumping into a plane and kicking ass with him. Let's talk about the effects for a moment. The CGI was perfect, it looked like there was a giant alien ship menacing Los Angeles and when it fired, it looked like they really destroyed the White House. The aliens were creepy and scary looking design, the most unique monsters I've seen for a long time. A classic science fiction that goes up there with the fifties WAR OF THE WORLDS. I give it...10 STARS!",10,0,2,1 July 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Crossover, I love a good crossover!
","I love cross overs as you might already know if you read any of my crossover reviews. Anyway, I love cross overs and this is a great cross over. I love the 'ALIEN' series and the 'PREDATOR' series. So put them together and you get one hell of a movie. I love the CGI effects for the Face-Huggers. I love the face offs between the Predators and the Aliens. It was so cool to have Lance from the Alien movies in it. The cool movie is full of cool elements and I can't wait for the second movie coming in 2007. That is all I have to say, just watch the story without judging. You won't regret it. I give the movie 9 STARS! Be sure to catch it on DVD.",9,0,3,29 July 2006
Batman Begins," Far different from Burton's Bat.
","It's been over ten years since the last Batman flick and they removed Tim Burton out of the equation, thank Heavens for that. Don't get me wrong, I love Tim Burton, I love Nightmare before Christmas and Corpse Bride. But I think he screwed up big time on the Batman movies, too many stupid changes. When it comes to something that's been going on for close to a century you don't f*** with what works. Gothem looks like a real city, no stupid Gothic giant statues everywhere. I wish they didn't go with the body armor like the last four films and you they should have used the same material they used in SPIDER-MAN, because you can't see Batman's eyes either. But this is the most fateful version of the comic book in a long, long time. I think the cast and crew should be commended. I like the supporting cast and on a whole the best BATMAN movie to date and I can't wait for the next one. I give BATMAN BEGINS...9 STARS",9,1,2,26 August 2006
Ghostbusters," One of the best movies of the decade
","Let's start with the fact that I was thirteen the year Ghostbusters came out. I wanted to see it so bad. I did, and man was I impressed. The story, the effects, the humor all was prefect. Got to be some of the best effects in a movie ever. Past and present included. The ghost designs were major league cool and Slavitza Jovan made one sexy evil Deity. Up there's really nothing I can say bad about Ghostbusters, nothing. To this day the first Ghostbuster remains near the top of my favorite movies off all time. Nothing can take that away. The acting was perfect, the storyline perfect, the writing and dialog was perfect. What can I say, look up perfection and the original GHOSTBUSTERS will be there. I give the perfect movie a perfect score of 10 STARS.",10,0,0,26 August 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," Frights in the strip club
","Now vampire strippers are cool and the director does a great job. The cast is amazing and the story really works. The vampire effects really works and the CG effects works and keep an eye out for Cheech who plays three different parts, all perfectly. Can you point them out? George Clooney is a very likable rogue and Quienton does a great acting job. This is one of the most unique twists on the vampire genre. It is unexpected fun flick with lots are thrills and action to make the most hard core action fan at the edge of his seat. It's just perfect, almost, not quite. But close to perfect. Now this is a flick that is worth watching over and over again. 8 STARS.",8,0,1,10 March 2007
Toy Story 2," Gotta love them toys
","You really gotta love them toys. As you may or may not be aware I loved the first movie. So far to me Pixar can do no wrong. Everything that came out of Pixar is perfect, the first Toy Story, the Incredibles and now Toy Story 2. The story is interesting and I love the other Buzz Lightyear from the toy store. The writing, the characters, the animation all perfect. The cast does a fantastic job in this movie and if you liked the first movie, then you will love Toy Story 2. However if you didn't like the first one and in that case then what the hell is wrong with you? But in the sick case that you didn't like the first movie, then you will not like this one. I give Toy Story 2 a perfect 10.",10,0,2,9 December 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Seems like the series is getting darker and darker
","But that doesn't really bother me, this is the first Harry Potter movie to be rated PG-13, which is a little harsh considering what happens. I've seen more violence in a plan PG movies in the old days. The rating board is too strict, it's time to reform of dissolve the rating system. Other countries don't blind fold children from he very world around us. that's just stupid. Anyway, about the movie, the characters are all there, I like the new character of Madeye. Now Harry has to face something more terrifying then giant three headed dogs, men with two faces, giant spiders, giant snakes that kill by looking at you or even fire breathing dragons, asking a girl out on a date. That's one terror he may not be able to face. Anyway, I didn't like the fight between Harry and Ron, good friends shouldn't fight over stupid things.",9,0,1,11 November 2006
The Witch," Light! In a movie! Who needs that?
","Here is a rare thing, the critics love this horror movie from A24 and all I have to say is... WHY?! For a movie called 'The Witch' or the 'VVitch', the witches get little to know screentime and no dialog. We never find out why the family was banished and was it part of the coven's plot? The pacing is terrible, there are long stretches of nothing happening. The cinematography is horrible. It's so dark, even during the day. There is a scene where we see the coven dancing naked but the camera is like a football field away and the only light is a bloody campfire. It's boring, having a black goat the devil was so obvious they didn't even bother trying to hide it. He's on the cover. I've seen several movies from A24 and so far they have Brain Damage failure record. But somehow A24 gets praised when they're the same crap as Brain Damage. Lastly: SPOILER ALERT! FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT IT SPOILED, THEN STOP READING.: Everyone is dead and Thomasin, the eldest daughter joins the coven. Which makes no sense, that came out of nowhere and they butchered her family, so why?",1,1,7,20 December 2019
X2: X-Men United," X-tra mutant fun
","Okay, let's start with that they did right with X-Men 2. They continued the battle between bigots and mutants. They show that Magnus isn't all bad. Lady Deathstrike is cool, but they forgot the Lady part in the name. All the good points make it worth watching, but is it perfect? No, I'm afraid not. Again, Director Bryan Singer does not use the X-Men costumes. What's the point of having code-names if everyone can see their faces? Plus, I learned from a documentary on SUPERMAN that Bryan never read comic books and that was a good thing. How is that a good thing? That's like having my mother direct a horror movie, she doesn't watch horror movies, she doesn't like horror movies. So, how the f*** can she direct a bloody horror movie? I think know the source material is a good start when directing something is based on something else. I'm sorry, but knowing what your working with seems important to me. There are changes in characters and situations that I don't approve of. But all and all I guess I give this movie 8 STARS.",8,0,0,21 April 2007
Final Destination," What a stupid concept!
","SPOILER ALERT!This has got to be the dumbest concept for a horror movie ever conceived. Death stalking people, that's not right. I'm mean really, the Grim Reaper or Death has one job, collect or reap souls of people who have already died. I mean what the hell is the freaking' point of having a freaking' vision of impending death if you can't do something about it? Well? Somebody please answer me that? What was Alex suppose to do, sit in his seat with his hands folded saying 'Oh well, we're going to die. Can't stop it, IT'S DEATH'S PLAN!' Who gave him the vision, I'm thinking God, and how dare Death think his plan is better then God's plan, if God wanted these people to live, then why did he stop him. Another thing, since Death is a solid creature that can arrange fatal accidents, then why can't at least the audience see it. I mean really, this is a movie, not freaking radio. I would like to see the monster. Finally the ending, which basically saying you can never escape death. If you are going to die, then just die. Even if you see it coming ahead of time, just sit down and except it. If not, you'll have an invisible monster out to kill you for messing up his 'plan'. Why don't you just stop watching them and they'll stop making them. I mean they must be running out of idea, there is no final destination in a roller coaster. I give this and the entire series of crappers the THANKSGIVING TURKEY!",1,14,30,11 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Coolest trilogy ever
","I got to admit that I am impressed with THE RETURN OF THE KING. The final installment of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. The story, the characters and the acting are true to the novel. No major changes that I can tell either. The best picture of the year and for once in the history of the Oscars, I agree whole heartily. The emotion, the monsters, the effects were all just perfect. Not thrilled with the design of the Nazgul, I liked the TV animated movie much better. The floating glowing eyes thing. Anyway, I do feel that this is a perfect movie and I would hate to think that anyone on this planet would hate or even dislike this movie, I think everyone should see it and I give it a perfect 10 STARS.",10,1,2,7 November 2006
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Surprisenly funny flick.
","As silly as the premise is for this movie, I got to admit I liked the characters. The story is good, and the cast does a great job with this slightly far fetched concept. Alex Winter who looks a lot like Sean Penn is great, and this is Keenu Reeves break out film. This is what is called a sleeper hit, people didn't except it to make a ton of money. Let alone a sequel and a short lived animated series. Which I also enjoyed. Bill and Ted are cool characters, they are likable and have good hearts. These are the kind of underdog who love to root for to win. The effects are cool, and the humor is very funny. all though I would have liked to seen a dragon in dark age time. That would have cool. But such is life. All and all a near perfect flick and worth watching over and over again. I give BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVNETURE...9 STARS.",9,0,0,11 November 2006
Sin City," Some say this movie is dark. No, night is dark, this is darn right bleak!
","Some say this movie is dark. No, night is dark, this is darn right bleak! Now I like the cast and the whole film noir look to it or as they call it today Neo Noir. But there are several things that I can't get around, things that I can't suspend my disbelief over. The days of beating a false confession out of someone died a long, long time ago. In this day and age, even if Internal Affairs was also in the Cardinal's back pocket. There's still the Press and the FBI. Besides that, if he's killed in the electric chair, then how can he be narrating the story? What he's telling God his story. Then there's the Senator in the Bruce Willis story, how can he do that? When the President, the most powerful politician in the world can't get away with a simple break in or banging a chubby intern? He can't! He'd never get away with hiding a pedophile Progeny. There's also the grim look at the Church, this is way to dark for me. I look for some ray of hope in my movies. THE NOOSE!",1,1,9,28 April 2007
The Wizard of Oz," The Wonderful World Of Oz
","Now this is a true classic in every sense of the word. The music, the story, the cast, the acting. This is all great. Of course I wasn't around in 1939 when it first came out, the first time I saw it was like many of you, on TV then later of VHS tape. I've seen this movie so many times that it isn't even funny. So many times I lost count over a decade ago. But as many times that I've seen it, I will never get tired of the WIZARD OF OZ. Now the only complaint I got and it's minor I assure you is that some of the musical numbers run a bit long, like a lot of musicals of the time period. But that is minor compared to the whole thing. 91/2 STARS",9,5,6,5 May 2007
