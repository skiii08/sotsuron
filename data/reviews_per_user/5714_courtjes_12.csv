It," Goonies rip off and irrelevant smoking by a 15 yr old
","Why do all the movies, especially aimed at kids, feel obligated to the tobacco companies to have smoking scenes, product placement? Maybe because they put a lot of $$$ in to the actors and writers?Skip this one and watch The Goonies again.",Null,1,1,21 September 2019
Hereditary," Audience broke out in laughter!
","At one of the supposedly intense scenes while Annie was having a meltdown, everybody in the theatre started laughing. And so it went, incredibly slow moving part, over acting and some occasional thrills near the end. Not seeing why the critics found it so great. Definitely not in same league as Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby. I prefer a movie like It Follows. I would not recommend this movie, its more like a tv movie.",Null,4,9,24 June 2018
Troy," brad pitt is awesome
","Brad Pitt is awesome as Achilles. He shows he can act with the best, such as Peter O'Toole. The movie itself moves at a good pace, Helen is beautiful and stunning but her character never develops. Orlando Bloom's character is a true wimp, but Orlando plays the part well. Great movie! The battle scenes do get a little repetitive, Hector's character also played well, top notch. The musical score is fine. Has to be seen on the big screen. Location shots worked well.",Null,53,104,2 June 2004
"I, Tonya"," No sympathy for Harding.
","This movie tries to excuse Harding's conduct by portraying her (miserable) mother and former husband as cruel and abusive but Harding made no effort to improve the quality of her life.
But does that excuse Harding's classless, disrespectful, abusive personalty? No way.
The acting is good, and the production fine.
The movie attempts to encourage sympathy for Harding but its difficult to believe she wasnt involved in or at least know of the attack on Kerrigan. Clearly her mother, if portrayed accurately, is one of the meanest, evil people one could ever meet.
Overall, I would recommend this movie only to get the historical background but be skeptical about how Harding and Gilhooley are shown. It seems they are more culpable in real life than the movie suggests.
The cigarette product placement is annoying and insulting and if big tobacco paid to finance this film, it should be made public and investigated.",Null,9,20,15 January 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," best redford and newman movie
","Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid is outstanding. I loved it when I was in school when it first came out and years later its still funny, sad, and the movie that inspired the buddy films, none of which are as good. Redford is capable of comedic roles, if you see Barefoot in the Park, you know what I mean. Yes, they were great together again in the Sting but that movie didn't have the chemistry that Butch and Sundance have, and Katherine Ross looks every bit as gorgeous as she did in The Graduate. Terrific cinematography, and comic but insightful dialogue. And who can forget the scene when the horses come flying out of the train. Perhaps we have all felt at some time in our lives the way Katherine Ross did when she wanted to go to Bolivia: 'I'm 28, single and a teacher'.....",Null,0,2,25 November 2006
Collateral," vincent as in Pulp Fiction?+
","The name 'Vincent', was it chosen randomly? Is it a deferrence to the amazing work of Travolta in Pulp Fiction, another hit-man with the same name? Great movie! I missed the significance of the jazz club scene and have to see the movie again. Leaving the room for only a minute in a movie like this is like leaving to get a glass of water for the old Mike Tyson fights: you miss it all. Normally I consider Tom Cruise a lightweight in acting department. He has had great movies but not necessarily because of him. War of the Worlds would be just as good with almost any other actor. But he brings great understated sense to this character. Jamie Foxx is incredible and the gorgeous prosecutor: she steals every scene she is in. I put Collateral on because I had nothing else to do while working on my laptop. Within minutes I was engaged in one of the best movies of the year. Watch it, you will love it.",Null,0,0,8 August 2006
A Quiet Place," 'Signs' knock off but still good! (spoilers)
","In Signs the aliens had a weakness: water.
In A Quiet Place: certain sound.
Very similar in plot but Place for me the overall better movie. Lots of good tension, and surprising character changes. No wasted time on backstory, the newspaper headlines tell it all. One particular jab at the bureaucracy is cute, the Dept of Defense says 'you're on your own.' lol Overall John and Emily are great together and it is a blockbuster must-see movie.",Null,1,1,6 May 2018
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood, Nicholson, Hoffman ignore the whiners....
","Another awesome thought-provoking movie from Clint Eastwood. Million Dollar Baby is the kind of movie that gets you in the gut. Three days after I saw it I am still thinking about it.Hilary Swank is fantastic and deserves Oscar and of course Morgan Freeman gives an outstanding performance. There are the usual whinersand complainers about Clints views on religion, disabilities and on and on. Get a life people. Its a MOVIE! Meant to make one think and ponder.There just aren't any younger actors with the talent and drive to replace Clint Eastwood, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman when they retire. There are a lot of wannabes but no real talent. This is one GREAT movie.",Null,4,7,18 February 2005
Love & Mercy," Worthy of Awards
","Love & Mercy has outstanding action, direction, musical score, you name it. Elizabeth Banks conveys a wide range of emotions without saying a word. She has that rare quality to make the viewer actually feel what her character is feeling. While I am not a big John Cusak fan, this is one of his greatest performances as an actor. And Paul Dano is an young actor who again is absolutely excellent. Unfortunately this movie, like Pet Sounds album by the Beach Boys, will not receive the box office success it should. But it is a deeply moving movie with insights into one of the greatest song writers in music and should be nominated for several Academy Awards. Normally I do not gush so favorably in reviews but this is a movie that should not be missed. My only slight criticism is that longer versions of the early Beach Boys music should have been included.",Null,4,8,6 June 2015
The Descent," is it better than the CAVE??
","The Cave was nasty, awful boring movie. I don't know what was worse, the acting, the filming or the directing. Somehow I had seen the trailer for The Descent and without thinking about the time issues, saw The Cave when I was looking for a summer rental. What a mistake. So far the reviews of the Descent look good. Did anybody see both movies? Can you tell me if the premise is the same? I am going to see The Descent based on what I read here on IMDb. And can anyone recommend a really SCARY movie, like the Grudge? Thats out now, I mean. Unfortunately, IMDb requires ten lines so I will keep discussing scary movies generally. I liked all the Scream movies, although not really scary they had great sense of humor. The Grudge and The Ring I thought were great and hope Grudge2 doesn't disappoint. The trailer seems to show way too much of the movie, I hope it doesn't take away. The Descent doesn't look scary but does seem to be suspenseful. The reader comments make it a go.",Null,1,3,12 August 2006
Ray," reducing his life to a cigarette commercial
","Who paid for Ray? The tobacco companies? Its one big cigarette commercial and sometimes on the bar you can even see the brand. Its illegal to advertise smoking on TV so heres the trick: smoke, smoke, smoke in movies and of course it will soon be on TV. Ray Charles had a tough life and made great music. The acting is superb and the scenes of the time periods, excellent. What a cheap trick by big tobacco to reduce his life to one sometimes way too long cigarette commercial. Who gets paid by the tobacco companies? The actors? The studio bigwigs? Somebody does. Smoking in movies should be banned. Movie companies should be required to disclose payments to actors and actresses from the tobacco companies.",Null,0,2,21 February 2005
Signs," none better!
","The naysayers are wrong, this is a well-crafted GREAT thriller, just like the old Hitchcock movies like The Birds. Lots of cool sounds, creepy camera angles, intended humor. Acting is outstanding. People should just sit back and enjoy the first time. Then watch it again and find the ironies and subleties. GREAT, great movie. Thanks Mel and cast!",Null,0,1,15 January 2003
