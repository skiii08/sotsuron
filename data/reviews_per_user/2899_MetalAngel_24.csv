Whip It," Thoroughly entertaining!
","Who thinks Drew Barrymore could direct a film? I used to ask that question to my cinephile friends and the room would fall under a sepulchral silence, complete with the chirping cricket in the background. I mean, some people are simply BORN to be type-casted into their roles...like Drew Barrymore usually is- you know, the cute, cuddly girl with the wide smile, inviting eyes and somewhat childish personality. She's always being the character who begs to be hugged. What it boils down to (and this is the answer I used to provide to my own question) is that Drew Barrymore can act acceptably well but could never direct so much as a Care Bear commercial, because she just wasn't born for it.Well, yeah, I was wrong... After seeing her directorial debut 'Whip It' I found myself choking on my own question. I mean, sure, it's not an incredibly good movie, but it is far more exceptional and intelligent than the mediocre crap Hollywood dishes out nowadays and contains a few scenes that I just KNOW I won't forget. Now, for your information, this film isn't about cute and cuddly creatures or a flower-hearted, martial-arts bounty hunter employed by a sultry man named Charlie. It's actually about womens' roller skating derby and the thrill that it is. I know, it's SO un-Drew-Barrymore-ish but that's where the wonder comes from...it's not expected and the surprise you get is a really good one.So! The movie follows Bliss Cavendar, a seventeen year old girl from a small town few people have heard of in Texas. The role is played by the incomparable Ellen Page, whom I've learned to respect and admire after her miraculously flawless work in 'Juno' and 'Hard Candy'. Here, she plays a milder version of her 'Juno' character (the same rock-hard personality but will less sass and irony), a girl who's being smothered by her mother (played to comical perfection by Marcia Gay Harden). She's the weird kid who walks around in dark attire, wears unappealing glasses, has only one friend in the world and is THE rebel and free-thinker against a town of retreads who strive to keep an image of 1950's Southern perfection amidst their sexually active, brain-dead teens. Her mother forces her to go to these Blue Ribbon contests where she's to demonstrate what a prim, perfect belle she is. (The other contestants are all dressed in demure, charming gowns and praise the Lord and their deceased ancestors; Bliss appears with spiky, blue hair and praises Amelia Earhart among a disgustingly shocked audience. Yeah, it's THAT kind of town) One day, Bliss sees some derby girls handing out flyers at the mall in Austin, and finds herself awakened to her true calling: skating with the roller-skating derby girls. Now, the derby is a new sport for me, we don't have that where I come from. At least it WAS new for me before watching the film. Bliss escapes to Austin to watch the derby, falls in love with it, signs up for practice with the derby girls and ends up being one of them on account of her blinding speed and her capacity for taking hits without complaining (the roller coaster derby is a brutal sport, you know? It's all about skating fast, blocking people and kicking and slamming them until they've got huge bruises, a hemorrhage or a broken bone).In plot, it's your typical sports film where the main character is a teenager who's unhappy with the society and family she lives in (though Bliss' family is actually an exemplary one; her mother is just too overprotective and demanding), engages herself in the sport, gains nationwide attention, falls in love with a cute guy, strives to find the recognition of her family, etc... It has the necessary plot twist where everything goes wrong in her life, but then (through a clichéd make-up with her team members, family, best friend, etc.) everything is right again and it all ends in a big match.The good thing here is the way the movie is crafted. The dialogue is amazingly good and it sounds as real as it gets; while the plot is clichéd and flawed beyond repair, the dialogue is a breath of fresh air that softens the rank odor of the plot. The performances are very good, indeed, and there are those moments I mentioned above which you just can't get out of your head. There's Marcia Gay Harden, naively admiring the 'lovely vases' in a store, when they're actually bongs. There's a musical interlude, where Page and her love interest dive into a pool and kiss underwater in a family-friendly sex scene. And there's the scene where Bliss is receiving some advice by the derby team leader Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig), which is poignant in its simplicity and powerful in its directness.Talking about Maggie Mayhem, aren't those names the derby girls get simply hilarious? I mean, Bliss' team members are called Smashley Simpson, Rosa Sparks, Bloody Holly, Eva Destruction, etc. I read in Roger Ebert's review that it's quite usual for derby racers to choose witty pseudonyms such as this, and I can fully believe; the film IS based on Shauna Cross' novel, after all, and SHE was a derby racer back in the day. Also, most of these wittily-named characters are mostly played by real derby racers, and it makes up into a sports-accurate film.Is there a flaw? There are many! For some reason, the dialogue and the performances are the only good things about the movie- its saving graces. Whenever there's no dialogue the film seems to lag and to lose its point. Also, like I said, you know what's gonna happen from minute one until the very end because of its recycled plot. But...how can I convey the fact that, even through all the flaws, the film is quite enjoyable? It's good, and it's one of the most entertaining sports film of the year.",7,0,3,16 May 2010
Angels & Demons," If the dramatic changes from book to screen are overlooked, it is actually a really cool film!
","There's something about Dan Brown and his books that make him sort of Michael Moore's best friend, intellectually-wise. With each of his works, he tries to expose a large and important area of society or corporation and make it the latest scandal or controversy. A few years ago, Ron Howard made a film about Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code' and it immediately stirred controversy and heated discussion in many countries because of its views exposed towards the church, and of course, no one even mentioned the incredibly creative plot or the masterful writing, but only the religious content. Never mind that Ron Howard (who used to be one of my favourite directors) left the film almost devoid of any of the charm and suspenseful wit the book possessed; but whatever. Dan Brown's other book, 'Angels & Demons', the prequel to his Da Vinci Code has now been transformed into a movie, with Ron Howard directing again...and that's enough to make anxious Brown fans flock to the movie theaters, biting their nails in apprehension.Okay, I know that my job as a film reviewer is to review the film itself, without taking the book as one of the primordial points I should focus on, but before we go on with the review, I just have to get this out of my system: The book is an amazing masterpiece, expertly constructed and so engrossing you actually find yourself reading it all through the night and arriving next day at work with soggy eyes but a content expression. Those of you who are fans of the book and want to see the movie, be warned- it should contain a message that says 'this film is loosely based on the book by Dan Brown', because it changes so many things and modifies so much plot that the book and the movie could at some point seem like two completely different things. But what can you expect from a two-hour-and-change film directed by Ron Howard? Having said that, let's continue the review.Leaving the immense differences between the book and the movie apart, you would have to admit that the film isn't all that bad, really. Yes, we have Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), the symbologist we've all come to love, who's an erudite and know-it-all respectable professor at Cambridge, and who's written, ooh, tons of books and articles. There's this gigantic nuclear lab somewhere in Europe where top scientists from around the world create the most innovative (and sometimes unbelievable) things; a short number of these scientists are working on the creation of antimatter (the opposite of matter) which could explain the origins of creation and which could become a valuable source of energy. And there's also an important event going on in the Vatican City, namely conclave, where the Pope has died and the world sits still until a new Pope is elected.Then, a scientist in the nuclear lab is killed, a canister with a small spec of antimatter (which could blow up and entire city) is stolen and suddenly appears to be hidden somewhere in the Vatican City. The people who stole this powerful source of energy and destruction call themselves The Illuminati, an ancient and long-forgotten sect, who have sworn that the four principal cardinals of the Catholic church are to be executed prior to the antimatter canister blowing up at midnight of the same day. And who do you call to solve a crime and stop a terrorist plot involving a long-dead sect? None other than our dear Robert Langdon who, we're not surprised to learn, is an expert in their symbology and history.Well, that's the premise. What follows is another version of the puzzle-solving, car-chasing, suspense-inducing, church-terrorizing, quick-thinking 'Da Vinci Code'...only better and more believable. At least you can rest easy knowing that Ron Howard has made this film into a truly enjoyable experience, and he has learned from his mistakes in his previous film to make this into something you can actually cheer and applaud to. The film is fast-paced but well-structured, expertly acted, intelligent and witty beyond measure. The production design, cinematography and costume design merge to transport us into a breath-taking guided tour through Rome, the Vatican City, and the people and customs involved therein. Hans Zimmer's score is fabulous, transforming his original Da Vinci score into a wonderful listening experience, at times exciting and heart-pounding, at times otherworldly and heart-wrenching.Yes, truth be told, I really liked the movie. Even the changes that were made from the book to screen are acceptable (because if nothing had been changed, then we would be staring at a five-hour movie, at least). In conclusion, it is better than the Da Vinci Code, it is one of Ron Howard's most entertaining movies, and an all-around fun experience at the movies this year.Rating: 3 stars out of 4!",8,0,1,5 October 2009
The Young Victoria," A touching, pleasing historical epic.
","There's something about historical epics that make us movie fans flock to the movie theaters in raw expectation, and stop my beating heart if that historical epic were to be an accurate, well-researched and moving romance. What greater delight is there than watching a nice, good romance while learning a good portion of history, all enveloped in an exquisitely-crafted film? Jean-Marc Vallée's charming 'The Young Victoria' skillfully lives up to the aforementioned characteristics, and creates a feel-good movie experience that has your heart guzzling and your mind racing in excitement throughout its entirety.Yes, we love monarchs and their epic, larger-than-life experiences. One such monarch we all fondly remember is Queen Victoria, born in 1819 and assuming the throne at a very early age. King William (Jim Broadbent) is soon to die, Victoria is soon to come of age, and all around Europe rise interweaving conspiracies and plots to have Victoria sign an order of regency extending her powers to someone else and/or having someone seduce her with wit and modern political ideas and therefore influence her reign towards favoring a particular country or political party. But Victoria isn't as silly as everyone thinks, and she has a mind of her own...which is constantly been careened back and forth between diverging influences such as the Duchess of Kent's (Miranda Richardson) trying to make her renounce power to the evil Baron Stockmar, or Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) gaining her favour to help establish himself as Prime Minister...or Albert Conroy (Rupert Friend), King Leopold's nephew, who begins to fall in love with her while being part of a plot to earn the queen's protection of the Belgians.Among all these conspiracies and mind-boggling plots is the shy, growing romance between Victoria and Albert. The film is about history, politics and the nature of regents, but above all these subjects the love these characters feel triumph above all else and end up in one of the best regencies England has ever seen and one of the best love stories ever told. Jean-Marc Vallée does a wonderful job in toning down the film to a light-hearted level, where the history is enjoyable and where the love story unfolding isn't stale and clichéd but original and refreshing. And Emily Blunt's performance as the young, strong-willed and charming Victoria is excellent and enthralling; she wins you over from the start and opens up Victoria's heart and mind to the audience, making it easy for us to love Victoria the Woman and to relate to her and her life problems, no matter how epically different they are from our own.The screenplay is dazzling, such as we've come to expect from screenwriter Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park), and the film has that sublime, breath-taking, age-old beauty we can expect from lush, sweeping cinematography, mellow and inviting score and top-notch costume design. It's a film that doesn't depend on the acting, screen-writing or directing alone, but whose every part fit perfectly together into a pleasing, well-coordinated whole.The film never lags, but sometimes it carries a particular emotion too far to the point where it loses it strength, or sometimes it cuts abruptly between scenes (and countries) in its attempt to fully involve us in every conspiracy or in every character's setting that we lose interest in most of the secondary characters and await impatiently to the flowering, letter-driven romance between Victoria and Albert. And what's with the rushed ending? You're enjoying the film, completely taken in by the story, and all of a sudden we get a black screen with an epilogue. It's not a grand flaw of the film, but it does inhibit it from becoming a masterpiece to rival such productions as 'Shakespeare in Love' or 'Elizabeth'.I highly recommend it! It's a crowd-pleaser that will make you smile.Rating: 3 stars out of 4!",8,2,2,21 April 2010
The Hangover," The BEST comedy of the year!!!!
","Oh my god. I simply had to write this critique straight off the theaters. There is no way to exemplify how much fun and original this movie is without raving on and on about it all night (which would make me disclose a million spoilers, and you don't want me to do that).It's about four friends, one of them is getting married in two days, and they decide to go to Las Vegas to have their bachelor party. Everything starts out all right, with the four dudes toasting atop the rooftop of their Vegas hotel to a wonderful unfolding night, and then we fast forward to the next morning, when three of them awake in their hotel bedroom (which is wrecked beyond repair and features a hilarious set of new additions) and they notice the groom is missing. What's worse, none remembers what happened the night before. And so begins their two-day adventure through Vegas trying to find their lost partner and, in the way, discovering the hysterically crazy things they did that night.At first, it may seem like your typical bromedy, and you indulge in the movie's plot expecting to have a few laughs and later forget about it. But you get, oh, so much more. The character development is spot-on, the plot is seriously funny and (wow) believable even in its absurdity. The performances are very good, the directing is awesome. The film actually involves you, and it doesn't take itself too seriously and it doesn't try to be funny, unlike other comedies who seem to strain themselves to force laughter out of you. This is a truly special comedy, perhaps the best comedy I've seen all year.The screenplay itself is worthy of its praise, and I wouldn't be amazed if it pulls a stunt at next year's Oscars receiving an Academy Award nod. Todd Phillips certainly rein-vindicated himself and his film earned a rightful spot among those which we'll remember for some time to come. Why, it's even better than 'Pineapple Express' and 'I Love You, Man', which I also consider to be excellent bromedies.Whether you simply want to be entertained, or whether you want to experience a fun, modern comedy that's both hilarious and perfectly-made, you can't miss out on this one.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 4!!",9,6,10,25 August 2009
12 Angry Men," Utter cinematic perfection!
","Sidney Lumet's ultimate masterpiece '12 Angry Men' is a paramount in film history and is certainly the most memorable of courtroom dramas, a film that stands true to what intelligent, perfectly-made cinema ought to be.The plot is simple enough. It's about twelve men from different social backgrounds and jobs who make up the jury of a murder trial for an 18-year old kid who has allegedly stabbed his father in cold blood. They (the jury) must now retire to a private chamber and discuss the verdict before sentencing the murderer to either death or freedom. The entire film, then, takes place inside this chamber and follows the arguments and quite heated discussions between these twelve angry men, as they attempt to reach an unanimous vote.From the start, while the men accommodate themselves in the room, we're introduced to them and their personalities, their likes, and basically we gather enough information to discern the type of person each of them is like. Also, they are never identified by their names, but are referred to according to how they were sitting in the trial, with a number from 1 to 12. It is in this setting of anonymity, of a locked room which is practically boiling in heat, that twelve different personalities clash, different points of view are alternately objectified and refuted, and the future or doom of a man is tactfully decided.It's a masterpiece, I tell you. The screenplay is sent from cinema heaven (Reginald Rose is a masterful screenwriter), for what begins as a discussion to eliminate all possible doubts becomes a passionate, gripping and utterly suspenseful probing into a different area of human bias. The ball is bounced back and forth among different subjects, and it's such a harrowing game they play that we watch transfixed through the entire duration of the film, uncertain of anything and equally unsure what to make of it. Is the kid really guilty or is he innocent? No one knows, they merely speculate, and like one of them says, 'Who knows what could be worse: sending an innocent kid to his death or letting a cold-blooded murderer free to do as he wishes?' The theme is searingly vivisected and analyzed, and you'll find your own morals, ideas and reasonings both questioned and assured in a mind-blowing way.Apart from the terrific screenplay (enhanced by rapid-fire, witty dialogue), Sidney Lumet has done wonders with space and cinematography. The fact that such delicate and controversial topics are being dealt in a stifling hot room by twelve men who are rapidly loosing their patience deals for an emotional powerhouse. Nothing can be avoided. Also, the camera angles, the focus of the camera itself, makes the room even seem smaller and more suffocating by the minute, with increases the heat of the arguments and the sharpness of the remarks. I read somewhere that the first shots in the movie are taken at a high angle and they slowly decrease to a point where, by the end of the movie, they're below the character's faces (I watched the film again and this fact is true). Also, different lenses were used to give the impression that the walls were shrinking. I tell you, it's cinematic perfection.The acting is point-perfect. Henry Fonda delivers a searingly intelligent performance as one of the jury members who poses most of the troubling questions, and amongst the other twelve, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden are equally powerful and entrancing. Overall, the film lasts a little over an hour and a half. But it's an hour and a half of pure delight, of witnessing amazing cinema unlike any we've seen in recent times. I mean, the film was made in 1957, and it's still as fresh and as original as if it had been released yesterday, even with an unnatural quantity of courtroom dramas that Hollywood spews out.I've seen my good share of courtroom dramas, and even in my young age I happily come to discover films like these that even having been done way before my time still manage to be more interesting than many.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10,0,0,8 September 2009
Orphan," This film restores my faith in contemporary horror thrillers!!!
","Horror thrillers are going everywhere, I tell you. From gruesome accidents, to supernatural and nightmarish creatures, to psychos, to ghosts...there's a horror film about everything. It seems like ages ago since I saw a film that made children- children, for chrissake- look truly demonic and terrorizing. That film was, of course, 'The Omen' (1976), but Jaume Collet-Serra's 'Orphan' (2009) has sparked again that fear. In fact, the 'terrifyingly evil' child in 'Orphan', I dare say, is at least ten times more fiendishly demonic than the child Antichrist Damian in 'The Omen'.Having said that, this film is about a couple: Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), who have two children but are emotionally recovering after the death of their third child, a stillborn. They both have issues, and that is a huge understatement. They try to live a nice, suburban life and at times they seem very, very happy. Their eldest, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) is your typical pre-tween playing Rock Band with his friends after school, playing pranks, and sneaking up to his tree-house to browse through Playboy magazines. Their youngest, Max (Aryana Engineer) is a cute, timid girl that's gone almost completely deaf. Kate is having the most problems trying to cope with the death of her baby, so she seeks constant help from her shrink (Margo Martindale, thankfully leaving behind her Hannah Montana's granny role), and she's quickly becoming your typical pill popper.Anyway, Kate and John decide they want to adopt a child, and they go to this orphanage where they're immediately impressed by Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a cute young girl who dresses like Little Bo Beep (like one of her cruel classmates points out), who has an amazing talent for painting, who's extremely polite, and has a smile that wins you over instantly. Kate and John learn from the orphanage's mother superior that Esther was brought here from Russia, where her house caught fire and her parents died. Altruisticly, our main heroes adopt the adorable Esther and take her home.Everything is fine at first. But, then again, this is a horror film. Esther doesn't seem to be the cute little girl we all thought her to be. She knows and uses a variety of bad words, has no problem killing small animals, roams around the house at night and watches her new parents have sex, pushes other children off tall garden sets, antagonizes Kate against her husband and just about disturbs everyone around her. And when the orphanage's mother superior discovers some really disturbing info on Esther's past, she really pulls out the big guns.As I watched this, I gasped and groaned in terror at how conniving, evil and downright loathe-able this Esther child was. Isabelle Fuhrman has really outdone herself with her role, showing us what I believe is the most hate-able and terrifying villain this century has seen. And Vera Farmiga gives a perfect performance too, as the helpless mother who sees through Esther's diabolic mind but whom no one believes. Sparks constantly fly between these two: the evil and protected child against the resolute but helpless mother. It was a nice change in family roles, and I found it refreshing. Also, this thriller doesn't follow the same formula for scares and thrills every other horror film nowadays pulls out. It bases its horror on the character of Esther herself, and we find chills running down our spine because of the things Esther says and does.The screenplay is, besides the child's superb acting, the strongest point of the film. It's perfectly developed, it has no plot holes I could discover, and in fact, it has the emotional depth and the pitch-perfect character development that reminded me of an M. Night Shyamalan film. You find yourself engrossed in the events unfolding on screen, and relating to the couple and feeling frustrated and irate because of the problems this devil child is bringing on them. And that's one of the things recent horror films fail to understand: that the power of truly psychological horror and tension is NOT a result of gore, or grotesque beasts, or ghostly entities or sudden shocks, but of the drama and tension between the characters. This film, basically, revived my hopes for contemporary horror thrillers.'Orphan' is not the best picture of the year. But it is one of the best movie-going experiences you'll have this year. And the end has a terrifyingly disturbing twist that audiences have gone nuts over. See it! You won't be disappointed.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 4!",8,2,4,28 September 2009
500 Days of Summer," Romantic comedies don't get any better than this!
","It's always a thrill to watch romantic comedies, because they make us feel good about life generally and because they confirm our beliefs that love is very much alive and that it can happen to anyone...even if these movies ARE absolutely fictional and carry a plot line that's as believable as The Lord of the Rings taking place in New York. This year, however, director Marc Webb has astounded us with a TRULY refreshing romantic comedy called '(500) Days of Summer', which is by far THE most original romantic comedy of the year, and which is not only life-affirming but which also echoes true life and which has a ring and a taste of certainty that no other film of its genre has captured.The film follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a man who studied to be an architect but who is now suffocated in a greeting-card business that's not very motivating but which does give him easy money to earn. He's the kind of man who believes that love comes to you, that you immediately FEEL who you'll live with for the rest of your life when you meet that person. In just a few minutes, the film opens up the character of Tom in a very complete, methodical and empathic way, and by the end of these first minutes, we feel like we already know him completely and that we sympathize with whatever he'll do. Now, this likable man who believes in happily ever after meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel), an equally likable and charming girl who the audience instantly falls in love with. Despite her appealing demeanor and her irresistible personality, Summer refuses to believe in true love and is convinced that she will NEVER find a man with whom she'd like to live with, let alone marry...and like the tag-line of the movie says: 'Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't.' The story is as simple as they come, but the way it's told is fresh and a pure joy to watch. Tom goes through the 500 days he's known Summer, but he doesn't do so in chronological order; scenes go madly back and forth in time, from day 275 to day 43, to 470, to day 1 and etc. This might at first seem a bit too crazy, but I ask you, who can detail the entire story of a long relationship precisely from day 1 to the last? Usually you begin somewhere and, once you start telling the story, you come back to previous events that support something else you said, right? This style of storytelling enhances the feeling of the movie and gives it the sort of 'puzzle solving' characteristic of other films. Needless to say, each scene is infused with the charm and wit of both main characters, and the days of their relationship pass through our minds, and we feel like we can savor their emotions, like their words inject life and experience into our bloodstream.Summer is a wonderful girl, she really likes Tom and she's willing to be friends with him and to have an open relationship. But Tom falls in love with her every day more, she allows him to do so and we see their intimate relationship go to such depths where the only outcome could possibly be a Happy Ever After. Nevertheless their views on life and love are so different that the story always keeps us in suspense as to what the resolution may be. Tom is besotted with Summer, she refuses to give the relationship another go, and as both their views begin to clash so much, we're (the audience) sure that ANYTHING is possible. It IS a romantic comedy, but there's no way we can predict the outcome, even if it's as obvious as they come. THAT'S the wonder of the film, how it takes such a simple story and give it infinite depth and charisma to a point where you cannot help but wonder why you've never seen such a heartfelt affirmation of life and love on screen before.It's a film without a single cheesy moment or without exploiting a single cliché either. It's completely new, and the charm exuded by the characters doesn't remind us of any other cinema couple. On the contrary, they remind us of ourselves, of the people we know, of true stories we've heard before. When we see them going into a karaoke bar in the movie, or when they meet at the park for a picnic, the situation, the dialogue, and the action are so REAL, so natural and so touching that you can't help but feel you know the characters personally. In a very silent and straightforward way the film engrosses you.The editing is perfect, and there's just no other order to the scenes. Change the sequence of one scene with the next and the film would lose its power. The cinematography is remarkable- with a particular scene where Tom and Summer are walking and he's showing her his favorite buildings- this scene is grandiose. And there's even a Broadway-style musical number which is totally adequate, complete with a choreography and animated bluebirds à la Song of the South; there's another poignant scene that's split-screen with a dream event occurring in one side and the dark truth happening on the other; there's also interview scenes where other characters give their opinions on the topic of love. The film is all-inclusive where photographic techniques are involved, and it gives the screenplay a playful and cheery quality which mesmerizes us.This film was sent from romantic comedy heaven, and it's one of the surprise best films of the year. It's sure to carve its notch among the best films of its genre ever. Go see it now! And, like every other critic has said, ignore the commas in the title; save yourself the loss of Ogdens.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10,0,0,11 January 2010
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," This film set the standards for black comedy excellence! Pitch-PERFECT!!!!
","What do you get when you mix the sheer genius of Stanley Kubrick, the appeal of the black comedy genre, the funny performance of Peter Sellers and a thrilling political plot? What you get is 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb', a film that's bound to be hailed forever as the best black comedy ever! When a crazy army general who keeps raving about how the Russians are 'polluting our bodily fluids' orders a massive attack on Russia, his aid Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to wiggle out of him the army code that will stop the invasion. Inside the Pentagon's secret War Room, the US president (Peter Sellers), with the aid of America's most powerful men, gets on the phone with the Russian president trying to calm down the heat while his own adviser, the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers...again) convinces him that this attack will detonate a massive nuclear weapon that will annihilate all human life on Earth.As you may be thinking, this is a far-fetched plot that screams of political intrigue and military action. A political thriller, if you will. Now mix in the fact that every character is seriously funny, that the dialogue is spiked with wit, irony and double-meaning, that every frame in the movie carries hilarious innuendo, that most of the twists and hilarious situations are a result of the fact that every military order and political negotiation is carried out through the phone...and you get an exciting, intelligent, immensely funny movie event that you'll remember forever.Peter Sellers is hysterical in each of his three roles. As the witty, fast-talking but awkward British captain Mandrake, he is vaguely reminiscent of his role in the Pink Panther films. As the useless and so-serious-he's-funny US president, he adds a satirical tone to the film. And most importantly as the colourful and quirky Dr. Strangelove, he presents us with a character that's bound to be remembered in film history.Stanley Kubrick is at the top of his form for this film. He's managed to make the movie about everything at the same time. A political satire, a criticism on war, a criticism on nuclear weapons, a searing portrayal on sex and its blinding recurrence in mens' minds, and altogether a hilarious, intelligent and thoroughly enjoyable film.I know I'm not being fair to the film. It's so much greater than what I'm actually portraying it to be, but I can't indulge in explaining how much a masterpiece, a paramount in film history it really is without divulging a great number of spoilers. I'll just say that you should pay careful attention to every situation, to every frame, to every line of dialogue. You'll be blown away by the kind of genius this film is.And there's a plus! This is the kind of film that lingers with you, that makes you think. And it's about so many topics that you'll find yourself thinking about and relating it to so many situations nowadays, giving the film a current relevance that is simply surprising for a film made in 1964.Whatever your favourite film genre is, you'll have a wonderful good time with this one. See it NOW. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10,2,6,20 August 2009
Shutter Island," Wow! I mean really, WOW!!!!!!!!!!
","How can someone not love Martin Scorsese? He continually reinvents himself and usually comes up with some of the best films ever seen in Hollywood. And he's also tried almost every genre there is: from deep sports dramas ('Raging Bull') to horrifying case studies ('Taxi Driver') to poignant period pieces ('The Age of Innocence') to blockbuster action thrillers ('The Departed'), he adds a generous touch of greatness to all his films and makes them memorable in our minds. He does the same with his latest cinematic triumph 'Shutter Island', a psychological thriller of almost surreal proportions and breath-taking beauty; it's not your typical Martin Scorsese film (then again, no Scorsese film is TYPICAL Scorsese), but his genius is apparent throughout the entire two hours and twenty minutes of the film.The story follows Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), a war veteran who's investigating the disappearance of a dangerous psychotic murderess from Shutter Island, a secluded high-security prison for the criminally insane. The island itself is enough to give you the creeps: the only building is the prison itself, and the rest of the island is a vast wilderness of falling trees and jagged rocks. It's constantly being beaten by rough waves and storms, and the island is situated in the middle of nowhere; the only way in or out of the island is through its feeble port, which is controlled by the US army. The wardens at the island are mysterious and creepy (they're Ted Levine and John Carroll Lynch, the psycho murderers of 'The Silence of the Lambs' and 'Zodiac', so you get the picture) and the chief doctors and psychiatrists at the prison are even creepier: Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow), very intelligent specialists who always seem to be on the 'patient's' side and who mysteriously are uncooperative with Teddy's investigation.A patient named Rachel, a woman who drowned her three children, is one of the most dangerous inmates at the prison. She's quite violent (they say), and she lives in a delusion where her children are still alive and where the prison is actually her home and the inmates are her neighbors. During a stormy night, Rachel goes missing from her cell...which is quite strange, given the amount of security this particular prison offers, and she is now out and about who knows where. Teddy arrives to Shutter Island with his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate her disappearance and to aid the wardens in her search. Nevertheless...Teddy has a secret agenda in accepting to help this investigation. As a war veteran fighting in the liberation of Dachau during WWII he learned of some horribly inhuman psychological experiments that were being conducted by the US government on the criminally insane, and he plans to uncover if Shutter Island has some connections to these experiments (which it probably does).Teddy is a highly tormented man: his experiences in Dachau, where he came in full view of the horrors humans are capable of have left him scarred. Not only that, but his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) had recently been killed in a fire accident in his LA apartment, where the pyromaniac janitor who worked there had been proved guilty and had been sent to Shutter Island but of whom (mysteriously) no one in Shutter Island has heard of. With a heavy heart and a heavily-laden agenda, Teddy aims to uncover the truth these creepy wardens, psychiatrists and patients are withholding from the world...but Shutter Island turns out to be more than Teddy can handle, and he soon finds himself in a nerve-shattering race to stay alive and, more importantly, to keep his sanity.The movie has all the elements of a pitch-perfect thriller, and it is just that. It's a thriller that has you breathless from the very first scene all the way to the very last horrifying twist at the end. Over two hours long and it doesn't waste a single minute. Once again, Scorsese gives a heavy dose of depth to his characters, especially Teddy whom we come to understand and identify ourselves with very early in the film. Every single scene is perfect! The cinematography is breath-taking and sublime, the lighting is a thriller's dream of perfection, the sound design and the music augments the film's tension to nerve-shattering levels and the exemplary acting makes the events unraveling on screen and the truths we discover all the more astounding. The screenplay, adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel has little or no flaws, and Scorsese seamlessly weaves all these quality aspects into one of the best films of the year! What can I say? I'm afraid that I can't say too much, for if I utter another syllable of the plot I would be giving the game away, and the individual aspects of the film work in such perfect symbiosis that they CAN'T be reviewed piece by piece lest the film is deprived of the wonder it conveys upon watching it. Suffice it to say that it's one of the best Scorsese films ever: VERY intelligent, suspenseful to a tee, deep, poignant, entertaining...you'll want to see it at least twice; I did, and the second time around it hadn't lost an iota of its greatness. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!! Oh, by the way: I can't fathom a possible reason why this film was left out of the Academy Awards this year. There's no reason, human or divine, why it shouldn't have received some nods. I can only hope it will be taken into consideration for next year's Academy Awards lest the Academy wants to indirectly declare themselves a fraud.",10,3,7,25 June 2010
The White Ribbon," Bar none, THE most haunting film I've seen this year.
","Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon' is a crude, dark film that haunts you endlessly- and I mean HAUNT in the highest sense of the word. I watched this film last night out of curiosity for the buzz it earned last year at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. As I was watching it I was both enthralled and appalled by how it vividly represented the darkest faults of human behavior, but I failed to consider it a masterpiece (like many other critics are doing). The film was over, I turned the DVD off and was soon asleep. I can't even come close to explaining how much the film haunted my dreams (and still does to this moment); I tossed and turned in my bed all night, my mind thrown into turmoil by the moral implications the film explores and the amount of difficult questions it forces you to face. It's a difficult film to swallow, but it's also a cinematic experience you'll think over for years to come.The film takes place in a small village in pre-WWI Germany. It is filmed in black and white, and the cinematography is perfect in giving it its aged, depressive feel. The story follows each (or most) of the villagers' lives throughout the year and a number of disturbingly mysterious crimes or 'accidents' that oppress the villagers' peace and in which many of the children seem to be involved. It would be utter madness to try and describe each of the characters, or each of the mysterious 'accidents' that unfold. Suffice it to say that Michael Haneke has managed to give us a thoroughly-nuanced story, and even though it deals with a great number of characters, they're all well-developed and of multi-layered depths; a heaven-gifted screenplay, if I ever saw one. I remember that I kept thinking 'This is what M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' would have looked like if it had been done flawlessly.' It's a suspenseful story because of the mystery behind the 'accidents', but it's actually more of a drama- a deeply-felt, crude but poignant exploration into the human soul and of the simplistic beauty in us all that rivals the beastly evil we all repress. It's about the loss of innocence to a world of war, greed, violence and envy; it's about love, and how such a pure feeling becomes adulterated with the hellish passion for sex; it's about the basest characteristics of humanity, and how they taint the existence of a few people living secluded in their village, quiet witnesses to the horrors around them but unable to act against them.It's not a simple film, no. And it's not a film to watch on a rainy Monday night, cozily snuggled under your covers. It's a film meant to be taken seriously, to be thoroughly analyzed, to have its every frame dissected and squeezed from its significance. I watched it for mere pleasure and discovered that I was almost bored to yawns: it's two hours long but feels like five, it's incredibly slow-paced, there is no raw emotion meant to be immediately understood (but everything must be interpreted from the characters' faces and tone of voice), every single scene has a definite, non-literal meaning...in short, it's NOT a movie you'll enjoy, but a film you're supposed to analyze and then to treasure for the amazing message it conveys. I went to sleep after watching the film pleased with it but unable to understand how such a... slow, emotionless thing had managed to capture critics' attention so. And then came the sleepless night, where I unconsciously ran over many scenes in my mind, analyzing their meaning and coming up with the horrid, deep and frightening conclusions the film gives us.Well, actually, it's not like the film itself gives us any conclusions, but it leads us to ask ourselves many questions concerning the abhorrent nature of humans and it points us to the turgid answers we'll be sure to get. It's a film that flawlessly presents beauty and horror as twin brothers who can't leave apart from each other. There's the mystery of the 'accidents' combined with the tragically dysfunctional lives of each villager, with the unfair treatment of the children, with the expressly marked roles of men and women, with the growing ambiance of war around them, with the loss of innocence in the town's children, with the inhibition of sexual discovery in each of them, with the refreshing love story between the narrator and a naïve teenagerwell, the movie imparts cold, direct facts of life, pieces of humanity in all their wonder or horror, and it's up to the audience to make any sense of it all and to come to one's terms with the implications of the film's message.I think of 'The White Ribbon' and I see it being the topic of discussion in cine-circles around the globe and in film classes. It's destined to become a classic because of the sheer amount of things it deals with and the absolute power one manages to uncover while analyzing it. If I were to start analyzing now I'd be giving away spoilers by the second and ruining what will surely be one of the best foreign films you'd ever watch. I can't recommend it enough!

District 9," Reinstates my belief in science fictions films. It's a wonder!!!!
","I've never been much of a man for science-fiction movies. After the days of 'Star Wars' and 'Back to the Future', Hollywood went through a period of time where everything sci-fi that it spewed was absolute trash, but lately it's beginning to redeem itself with incredibly good films such as 'WALL-E', 'Star Trek' and the incomparable 'Avatar'. So when a friend recommended I watch a sci-fi film called 'District 9' directed by Neill Blomkamp and produced by Peter Jackson, I did so with many expectations...and I must say the film delivers, enormously. I obtained a sense of utter satisfaction from watching it, and I declare it's one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen.It's completely fictional, of course. In a near future, a gigantic alien spaceship has arrived to Earth and is now suspended in midair over the city of Johannesburg in South Africa. After 3 months of uncertainty, humans board the spaceship and find millions of aliens living therein, malnourished, sick and in need of assistance; so the humans decide to transport all of these aliens to a holding camp in Johannesburg where the aliens can regain their strength and repose. These Prawns (that's how humans decided to call them, because of their obvious resemblance to prawns) are generally peaceful and adapt quickly to the rule of men, and they quickly become a hot subject for 'alien rights' and countless discussions and organizations worldwide. But they begin taking over the holding camp, so humans must evacuate it and fence it, and this alien camp on Earth becomes known as District 9.Now, District 9 is a serious problem because the Prawns have made their own small world inside it, they're reproducing at a fast rate and they're engaging in shady activities which cause great commotion to humans...so the MNU, the Office of Alien Affairs, decides to relocate the millions of Prawns to a larger camp outside of Johannesburg where they may not pose such a risk to humans, and they send their top employee Wikus Wan de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) with a team of soldiers to notify the Prawns of their eviction. Now, Wikus is a sweet, sympathetic, jolly man who takes this new job with happiness and excitement, but he's in no way prepared for what he encounters inside District 9...or how his entrance into the alien society will affect his life and that of his fellow humans.Now, where should I start? The movie is filmed almost in documentary style, with a variety of scientists, sociologists and experts being interviewed; they open the film by explaining everything that happened when the alien spaceship appeared on Earth, and lots of news footage is shown. Wikus is also interviewed, alongside some of his family members, and we immediately begin to establish a personality to this jolly man, who adores his wife and who tries to do his job as well as he can. He has a fascination with the Prawns, and we see him fidgeting excitedly and grinning from ear to ear when he's given the mission at District 9. He's a character we immediately like and easily identify with, even if he DOES have some traits that disturb us...like his unnerving need to touch everything, to explore, to probe into things that are really not of his concern. We see him like a sociable person who greets everyone at the base, who messes with soldiers' weapons without knowing what they are and who, once inside the camp, explores the alien settlement with fascination, touching, touching, touching.Before Wikus enters District 9, the interviewees on screen foreshadow an ominous event that 'happened' in District 9, and with which Wikus was heavily involved; that event is what the film is all about. The majority of scenes are taken by a hand-held camera, or from the buzzing helicopters, and it serves to involve us in the film's plot to a point where it feels like it's us walking beside Wikus, traversing the district. The editing is remarkable- scenes change, camera angles change perfectly, capturing that facial gesture, that body movement, lingering on that doubtful expression long enough to create tension and to move, fast-paced, onto the next scene. The score quite good, and since it's extremely subtle and muted, we're hardly aware it's there, and it builds up from sound to sound until we're so immersed in the action on screen we never really noticed when it got there to enhance the thrill and the suspense.This seems at first like any underground film, with a complete cast and crew of 'unknowns', but we KNOW it's mainstream Hollywood because of the impressive special effects and the magnificent production, manned by producer Peter Jackson. Just recalling his name reminds us of the astounding visual quality of his films, 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'King Kong', so there's really no need for me to try and explain the visual effects- they're amazing.Technically, the film is heavenly perfection. Thankfully, it also has a story, and a very good one at that. Now, the truly remarkable thing about the story is that it manages to involve us and it makes us actually CARE about the characters on screen, alien and human, even through some absurdly quirky characteristics of the plot. For example, the aliens who look like Prawns- they look cute and weird at the same time. Or the fact they could basically kill for cat food, which is practically their drug. A scene where tension is released and a possible street brawl featuring heavy gunfire is stopped with the help of some cans of cat food would seem laughable and silly in the hands of another director, but Neill Blomkamp has written and directed a story which, even through its implausibility, commands our attention and weaves a tapestry of action and suspense.The downfall of the film? I can't think of any.Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!!",9,4,8,11 January 2010
The Hurt Locker," Rivals 'Avatar' as THE best film of 2009!
","'War is a drug,' declares the caption on the opening scene of Kathryn Bigelow's masterpiece 'The Hurt Locker', and this phrase (written by an American soldier in Iraq corresponding with the New York Times), in its four-word simplicity, summarizes perfectly and shockingly the premise behind this astounding film. Bigelow has gone beyond her trademark film 'Near End', and has given us an even deeper and infinitely more intelligent film. Simply stated, 'The Hurt Locker' is THE film about the Iraq war we've all been waiting for.The film follows Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner, in a possible Academy Award-winning performance) who specializes in defusing bombs as he completes his mission period in Iraq, walking alongside his two specialist companions (Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) in a hostile land where everyone is an enemy and where everything might be a bomb. Unlike his fellow teammates who go about their dangerous jobs with caution and with a terrifying proximity to death, James pursues his missions with such excitement; with such charisma and with such longing that we begin to understand how the soldier who said 'war is a drug' was right. James craves the excitement and the sense of self-importance defusing bombs gives him, and he's THE best at doing it. He's untroubled by the danger; on the contrary, that's what makes his job all the more likable. But even though at first he seems like your typical savage-boy war hero, little by little he begins unveiling a deep and shockingly poignant personality, which he doesn't express through words but through his actions and facial expressions. This is a tough guy who's battling demons within himself and who's torn between life and excitement. This is a character unlike any you've ever seen before.The film paints a painful, eye-opening and crude portrait of the war on Iraq. We see children used as body bombs, honest civilians used as suicide bombers, we see people gather around the place where James is trying to defuse a bomb against the clock, the faces of women and children expectant and entertained by the violence. We see a country torn by war to its very core; we see simply humans trying to survive with no hope whatsoever and no dreams to uphold. The action sequences are driven by an unbearable tension which makes you gasp in pain; this is definitely THE most suspenseful and tense film of the year. Bigelow has demonstrated in past films that she's an expert at creating tension by submerging her characters in difficult situations and stressing their sanity; with this new film, she turns this on to a sky-high level, not only putting the characters' sanity at stake but wrecking the audience's nerves. The film is violent, but not so much as other war films, and the horror and suspense is gathered from the drama unfolding between the characters. From the first sequence to the last, we find ourselves riveted to our seats, not able to believe our eyes.The cinematography is excellent, it's fast and cuts to different scenes madly, taking in the entire environment and every single character on screen giving us a million different points of view and a sense of knowledge of the surroundings. The editing is savagely effective, and never does a scene linger too much or switches too fast- it's always precisely in tune with the emotions and the drama. The score is a cacophony of war sounds which heightens the tension even more and, like I said before, there will be moments when you'll believe you'll die from holding your breath so long. Add a pitch-perfect story written by Mark Boal (who also wrote 'In the Valley of Ellah', another movie based on the Iraq war), and you've got yourself the best picture of the year! The film really has no flaws, and at two hours long it doesn't have a single uninvolving second. Bigelow has taken a intelligent and effective war story, added art and controversy, mixed in exorbitant levels of suspense and therefore created a true masterpiece which will be remembered among the best war films ever made. See it if you know what's good for you! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10,39,61,11 January 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Possibly the best Swedish film of the decade!
","It's so hard to find a decent suspense thriller nowadays, isn't it? I mean, most thrillers out there DO thrill, but once the film is over you realize all the movie did was spook you momentarily, and you don't even wanna start identifying and analyzing the various goofs, mistakes and unbelievably stupid twists it took for fear of ending up with pieces of a failure in your hands. Yeah, Hollywood tends to do that nowadays with the so-called thrillers that are spewed out by the week. Thank heavens there are still people around who know how to make a thriller that thrills AND manage to make it a heck of a film, complete with a practically flawless plot, characters to die for and an ending that begs for a sequel. One such film is Niels Arden Oplev's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo', which I just finished watching and which I love beyond words. And, um, the film's Swedish, by the way...and just as a small side note, I think Swedish filmmakers should all teach Hollywood a lesson or two where thrillers are concerned: in 2008 the Swedish thriller 'Let the Right One In' wowed audiences worldwide and now comes 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' with equally powerful results. Need I say more? Anyway, the film's about reporter Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) who's been accused of libel to one of Sweden's larger companies because he published an article in the Millennium journal which he couldn't prove afterwards. Before Mikael serves his short sentence in jail, he accepts a job offer from Henry Vanger, the leader of a highly wealthy family, to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger (Ewa Fröling) who mysteriously went missing 40 years ago and whom no reporter or private investigator has managed to track ever since. Henry suspects someone from his large, wealthy family killed Harriet and is bent on discovering the truth before he dies of old age. Henry believes Mikael is the right man for one last go at the search because of the Intel he's received on his private life, a dossier which a highly intelligent, highly pierced and tattooed computer hacker called Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) has managed to built up. Mikael and Lisbeth team up to solve the age-old mystery surrounding Harriet's disappearance and the disturbing family connections that they must uncover before finally reaching the truth.Remember Jonathan Demme's 'The Silence of the Lambs'? A flawless thriller if I ever saw one. Remember what made the mystery and the suspense reach out to us? Flawless leading performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, that's what. We'll, we have the same exact case with this film. The story is very mysterious, the truths that are being unraveled on screen are nerve-racking, the suspense keeps you at the edge of your seat...but the lead characters, especially Noomi Rapace (whom I'm ready to hand over the Academy Award to) convinces us that it's not just another thriller à la John Grisham, but that there's actual HUMAN, believable characters there in the mix. Lisbeth is a goth, troubled young woman heaving a heavy past on her shoulders, and she turns up the attitude to the max playing out the fearless heroine of the story... but her down-to-earth performance, her multi-layered characterization, her pitch-perfect acting make her Lisbeth character jump out of the screen and touch us, win us over. We soon find ourselves actively rooting for Mikael and Lisbeth, actually CARING about what happens to them and believing every single thing that happens on screen...and all (or most of it) because of her wonderful performance. The film's focus is principally on Mikael, but whenever Lisbeth's on screen she steals the show hands down.The story is extremely well done too. Based on the best-seller by Stieg Larsson, it's the first part of his Millennium trilogy (which he managed to complete before his death, may he rest in peace) and which chronicle Mikael and Lisbeth's adventures. While I was watching the film I kept thinking 'this is the modern version of The Godfather meets Sherlock Holmes'. The Vander family is everything the Corleone family might've been like in the 21st century; they're scary, evil, powerful and degenerate, and each member hides dark, gruesome secrets, and they're all being faced by Mikael and Lisbeth, common people like you and me but extremely intelligent and resourceful. Quite the cinematic mix, don't you think? I heard the sequel, 'The Girl who Played with Fire' is already out in Sweden, and that gives me something to look forward to. They also tell me that the American remake of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is also underway, and that gives me something to fear. The U.S. just loves remaking the best films from around the world and they always end up destroying them; and I can't live with the idea of someone else destroying Lisbeth Salander. I heard they're thinking of casting Kristen Stewart in the American version; I recommend casting Noomi Rapace instead. Or better, just digitally insert Rapace's scenes into the American version and the film will have a good chance of being saved.Look, the film's excellent. It shines with a special brilliance I seldom see in thrillers nowadays, be them American or foreign, and it's a movie experience I'm bound to remember. I highly recommend it.

Clash of the Titans," Entertaining but unexceptional.
","I remember my fifth grade English teacher making us read Padriac Colum's 'The Golden Fleece', a long children's novel about Perseus, the sorceress Medea (the love of his life) and their adventures around the world, hunting for titans, monsters and defying the Gods. I remember this clearly, for she warned us that when we got to Mythology in our advanced English classes in college we were sure to flunk lest we learned our mythology right then and there, 'and what better way to do so than through this extraordinary introduction to the subject?' I've always been a literature fan, and I love doing my research correctly. Back then, my research amounted to having my mom taking me to the Cineplex to watch Disney's 'Hercules'. She took me on a weekend, and I remember returning to school on Monday anxious to inform the teacher and my classmates that Colum was wrong, because Disney didn't depict the mythological gods and heroes like he said. My teacher, bless her, set me straight and explained to me how films will never resemble the book, and how the book, in turn, will differ in many points from what Mythology scholars would say.That was 1997. I've never taken a single course of Mythological Literature since, but it was a surprise to go to the Cineplex again to watch Louis Leterrier's 'Clash of the Titans' and find that it didn't differ much from the portrait of Mythology our English teacher had painted for us back in 1997. The story is very much the same as I remembered it: Perseus, son of Zeus and a human woman, is seeking revenge from Hades for killing his Earthly parents, and is traveling with a bunch of soldiers from Argon to the ends of the world, seeking a way to stop Hades' Kraken from destroying Argon and trying to come to terms with his being a demi-god and his falling in love with the demi-goddess Io (not Medea, as my book would have it).There are three quite notable differences from film to Mythology, though: a) the characters' beards are wildly long and unkempt (I wanna say 'Neanderthal') unlike the clean-shaven heroes I saw in my book, b) their costumes don't fit into the preconception I had of Greek apparel; rather, the people are dressed in battle-wear and silk robes that scream 'The Passion of the Christ meets Frank Miller's 300', and c) there was no Kraken in any part of the Mythology that was taught me; I remember a Leviathan in The Bible and a Kraken in 'Pirates of the Caribbean', but no more.Then again, I had to constantly remind myself that this is Hollywood we're talking about, and no amount of unshaven Neanderthals in Greek armor can deter the main hero from being an Adonis, clean-shaven, perfectly-built and bearer of a modern port, handsomeness and demeanor which teenage girls would melt over. So, according to the Hollywood standards, casting Sam Worthington as Perseus is nothing short of infallible. Then there's the casting of Ralph Fiennes as Hades, God of the Underworld...and no, he's not dressed in a smoky dark tunic or has no blue flames as hair (like Disney would have you believe), but looks rather like Genghis Khan with ethereal fiery wings. Talk about imagination. Then there's Liam Neeson as Zeus, God of Lightning; his shining armor almost blinds the viewer and I was sure he'd join King Arthur any moment, brandishing his shiny sword around and having his braided and flea-infested beard flying behind him...but I digress.I guess I made my point about the costume design. Yes, they went too far and yes, it doesn't even look remotely Greek, but that can all be forgiven because of the imagination that went behind the design of the titans and demons Perseus and the Argonauts fight against. You'll find yourself in awe at the serpentine Gorgon, the stone scorpions, the Eyeless Fates, Pegasus, and even the non-mythological Kraken, who looks simply awesome.The plot is predictable, whether you know your mythology or not, but one doesn't see 'Clash of the Titans' because of its plot, but because of the action scenes, and it DOES deliver at that. Action scene after action scene leave you awestruck, even if the so-called drama and seedily clichéd dialogue attempt to destroy them whenever the battles stop for a breather and we're left with the characters simply staring and talking at each other à la Transformers Two. But to be sure, 'Titans' is your usual Hollywood action flick that bases its success on the special effects and a pair of steaming hot leading actors; the difference between 'Titans' and any other commercial money-milker, though, is that this one actually entertains the audience and pumps you up.Yes, it's a heavily flawed film. Yes, it's not the best film of the year. But it IS a great time at the movies and it IS guaranteed to entertain. Rating: 2 stars and a half out of 4!",6,1,1,5 May 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Impressive sight and sound show you're bound to be mesmerized by!
","It's a very strange and magnificent experience when you're allowed to watch the work of a true genius. This film is one of those experiences that simply transfixes you from the very first minute you start watching until the very last minute, when even the credits have rolled and you're still gawking at the blue screen, unable to believe your good luck. It was made in 1968, but even now in 2009 it still moves viewers and has an urgency, a 'now-ness' about it that makes it vibrate deep within your very entrails.The film is simply too powerful and mesmerizing to describe. There is, of course, the principal and obvious topic of space travel, high technology and missions to the different planets in our galaxy. The villain in the film is, without a doubt, one of the most memorable and loathsome heroes I've ever encountered in a film, and its presence itself is a cry against the insensitivity technology has attributed to man, to a point where our technological advance might actually constitute our eventual demise. And even when there seems to be no plot involved, and the film turns into a surrealistic sight and sound show we are presented with images about the nature of man, about the nature of human existence that weren't there in your head to begin with.The special effects of the film were ground-breaking in its time. I'm talking about over 40 years ago. Even today, they look excitingly modern and thoroughly believable, which is a feat I can't really say about any other 'oldie' I've ever watched. But even though the film is steeped in visual effects from start to finish, the special effects do not over-power or overcompensate the plot; they aid to the viewing experience, concomitantly with the dramatic music, the imagination and innovation and the either abstract or definite pictures to create an explosion of undeniable proportions that, as I've said before, will leave the viewer ecstatic until after the credits have rolled.This is one of those film experiences where, even though you're not completely sure of what you witnessed, you're absolutely certain you've been moved and you've just seen a masterpiece. I am not a big fan of 'oldies', so I had a bit of apprehension before seeing this film. I watched it because everyone seems to rave about it, and now that I've already seen it, I gladly join the ranks of audiences world-wide who praise this as one of the best films EVER made. I highly recommend it to ANYONE!!!!! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!",10,1,6,13 August 2009
Alice in Wonderland," A nice thing to watch but NOT to remember.
","Yes, Tim Burton is a director one should marvel about. He's directed such masterpieces like 'Edward Scissorhands', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and the somewhat recent 'Sweeney Todd', but like many other immortal directors he has a flaw. He's a visual genius who creates entire worlds out of scratch and quirky, involving characters that haunt our minds for many days to come...but he usually focuses too much on the visual aspect of his films and the result is that many of them lack the necessary luster in their story lines or character development, and its his characters precisely the ones who try to reach over audiences but who ultimately fail to do so in most cases. His latest box-office smash 'Alice in Wonderland' is an example of one such film, where every scene is a breath-taking picture that fails to remain in our hearts and minds in the end.We shouldn't be too hard on him, though. I mean this IS Lewis Carroll adapted to the screen, and the film is based on both 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass' two heavily surrealist books for children which never focus on plot but rather on frequently non-sensical situations. The film has an additional twist, also: 19-year old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland without a previous memory of ever being there before, where she discovers her ultimate destiny is to defeat a monstrous dragon commanded by the villainous Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter, who plays her role to comic perfection). To do so she'll need the help of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both played by Matt Lucas), the Cheshire cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), the Blue Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) and many others. The film is rank with quirky, Burton-esquire characters which are paraded before us one after the other and are seldom given a chance to actually make an impression.These characters do wonders with the few time that's given to them, though. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are especially hilarious in their lead roles, and most of the animated characters actually manage to make us laugh (the March Hare, voiced by Paul Whitehouse, is especially funny albeit the fact he's on screen for less than ten minutes). The film's point, much like the book, is to take children through an imaginary fantasy where nothing makes sense; but like many recent children' books adapted to the screen, an actual storyline has been introduced which tries to make sense and be profound but which fails entirely.A point which has critics and audiences in high debate is the CGI aspect of the film. Over 80% of the film is animated, and all of the flesh-and-blood actors have had their features exaggerated and altered with computer imaging; Burton's famous settings and Gothic magical landscapes are all animated now, giving them additional beauty and quirkiness but taking away every sense of wonder they had before. I mean, remember Edward Scissorhands' dark castle or Halloweentown? Now imagine them being CGI'd, paired with sweeping, fleeting camera takes. A pity, isn't it? The magical realism is lost, the artistic meaning behind Burton's film is diminished and we're left with an adventure comedy kids are bound to adore but adults are bound to quickly dismiss.Costume design and production design are perfect, as usual. Everything is meticulously detailed and it's a breath of fresh air to see actual art direction and production amongst all the CGI. The costumes the humans wear are a marvel of the imagination (but then again, it's Colleen Atwood, Burton's long-time costume designer, so what can you expect?). Danny Elfman's score is sadly forgettable, and I find this hard to digest since he's the composer of some of Hollywood's greatest scores ever. The plot is...well, disappointing even while factoring in the fact that it should be a plot-less movie. Why, Luis Buñuel's 'Un Chien Andalou' had a more intriguing plot and you ALL know how sarcastic I'm being by saying that. Burton's direction is interesting enough, but this isn't bound to be a film he'll be remembered for.Now, that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. It's VERY entertaining, as a matter of fact. I felt engrossed by the fleeting characters and the wonderful production design throughout the entire film, and once it was finished I had a sense that my time had not been wasted (much more than I can say for recent Hollywood flicks). It's a film full of blunders, though, and it's so much less than Burton is accustomed to give us that, even through its excellent points I fail to be much impressed. Oh, and poor Lewis Carroll; if he only knew how screenwriter Linda Woolverton has massacred his stories! See it, just for the hell of it. I liked it...but not too much.

Crazy Heart," It shines through its simplicity and plucks at all the right chords.
","Let me write this right away, right after I've turned the DVD off and while the experience still lingers warmly in my mind. Oh, how I do love a good independent picture: quiet, subtle, but an emotional powerhouse fueled by a strong lead performance for which there are no words. Such is the description that immediately comes to mind for Scott Cooper's 'Crazy Heart', a film that urges the viewer to accept a bittersweet shred of life and savour its tenderness and rawness equally.The film is a fictional biopic of Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) a once famous country singer who is well beyond his prime, whose career is reduced to playing on random bars and bowling alleys and who, at the age of 57, is forced to look back on his life and accept the fact he never amounted much to anything. The film's first scenes give you a breath-taking view of New Mexico's arid landscapes: beautiful, sparse, lonely and poetic...and these first images set the precise tone the film is gonna take. They will follow Bad through his minor, depressing gigs around the West, they'll see his life unravel under the influence of alcohol, and they will see his spirit rise to indescribably poignant levels after meeting a small-town journalist called Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who's to become the most important lover he'll ever have and the catalyst that incites a major change in his personality, eventually leading him to become a better man.Now, I'm not a big fan of biopics, especially if they deal with down-on-their-luck country singers and their booze addiction- we've seen too many of those, haven't we? There's not a single new thing to learn from yet another biopic peppered in country music. Well, that's wrong. This film came out last year and I immediately KNEW I wanted to stay away from it. Not even after Jeff Bridges won worldwide accolades and the film's theme song 'The Weary Kind' started earning so much buzz did I think to care about it. A friend of mine got me a copy of the DVD some months ago and it had been sitting there in my shelf for quite some time without the slightest thought...until a lonely night like this found me wallowing in my boredom. I reached for the DVD, shot it into the player and, oh my God, was I prepared for the emotional tour-de-force! Jeff Bridges is heavenly perfection in this role...and that's too soft a word to credit his performance. My God, he inhabits Bad Blake in ways few actors have ever managed to make characters their own. We've seen him play a wide array of characters through his career (with films so extremely different like 'The Prince of Tides,' 'The Big Lebowski,' 'Masked and Anonymous', etc.), and in most cases he manages to do a very good job with his characters...but there are just some roles you're BORN to play, and Bad Blake was his role. Bad is a man of few words, he's not a troublemaker, he's...well, he's your common Joe. He's REAL, he's a man I can assure you've met before. But how to make this man seem special, seem familiar, seem HUMAN in a two-hour and forty-seven minute film is no easy task. Screenplays can give an excellent characterization, great acting can give depth, great directing can make a character believable to us...but to make a character jump out of the screen, move you and treat you to such sharp pieces of life, and all through his normalcy, well that's the work of a genius, no less.The plot of the film is something we've seen a million times before. Nothing unexpected happens; no huge or witty twists move the plot forward. The charm of it all is how life-like it all seems, how every gesture, every line, every character seems familiar and warms us to them. Life is never as interesting as Hollywood pictures make them out to be; life is never an intelligent social commentary or even a profound work of art...life is life: simple, hard, bittersweet and undeniably poignant. THAT'S what both critics and audiences love so much about 'Crazy Heart': how, in its simplicity, it so faithfully projects life back at us, injecting our minds with the invigorating truths and heartaches that trouble us all. The center and heart of the film is Bad's relationship with Jean, and we root and cheer for them every second they're together and crave their return whenever they're apart; whenever something bad or sad happens to them, we feel just as bad as they do, because they're people we actually care about. They're real.Not only the acting is excellent, but many other aspects of the film are too. I've already mentioned the beautiful landscapes, but the cinematography as a whole is very good too: it embraces the scene whatever the action therein may be- no camera tricks, no specialized lighting, no sweeping movements or dramatic dollies...it's straightforward and convincing. The music is excellent- the score is muted and the songs compliment the action on screen (especially the aforementioned Academy Award-winning 'The Weary Kind', which closes the entire film and the topics dealt therein in such subtle beauty that you can't help but weep at its message), the costume and production design are very good. And the screenplay is very, VERY good, featuring naturally-flowing dialogue and some believable, show-stopping one-liners (including the now legendary scene where Jean, beautiful and half-hidden under lamp light asks Bad what he's thinking about and he, after pondering a few seconds, struck by her beauty and by the dangerous topics the conversation is going through, answers 'I was just thinking how bad you make this room look, and I hadn't noticed that until you came here.').See the film.

Inception," Nolan CAN'T fail! This film is perfect!
","Wow. I really mean it, WOW. A Hollywood blockbuster that doesn't only deliver action and special effects galore, but which also has a perfect screenplay, enough depth and which raises enough moral questions. A film which adventure/thriller lovers worldwide will praise for years to come and which critics are hailing as this year's best film (so far). Who would ever have thought that such a commercial film could pack such a punch? Yes, I am talking about Christopher Nolan's recent 'Inception'...so it makes sense, doesn't it? Perhaps the only mainstream director who can actually make intelligent Hollywood thrillers (let's not forget 2008's 'The Dark Knight' which will live on for eternity), he continues to live up to his name.As we've seen from his previous films ('Memento', 'Insomnia' and 'The Dark Knight'), Nolan excels at playing with his audience's minds and twisting the story to such complex but perfectly understandable depths that we can't help but marvel and be awed. This is one such film, which I'm sure will prompt film lovers to sit for hours in cafés and restaurants discussing the plot and which, try as they might, won't have a flaw to its name. It takes place in a very near future, where the ability to link two or more people while they sleep merges their dreams and creates an alternate reality. In their dreams, these people can imagine and live out fictional adventures which might never be possible...but they can also unconsciously reveal their deepest secrets. There's a secret agent Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is known for his complex imagination and for being able to wrestle any hidden truth while jointly controlling their dreams; he's being hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe), the CEO for a huge company which seeks to control most of the world's energy resources. The only thing standing in Saito's way is Fischer (Cillian Murphy), his greatest competitor's son, who's about to inherit his father's entire corporation.Saito approaches Cobb with the task of performing an 'inception' on Fischer. An 'inception' is when someone enters a person's subconscious via their dreams and plants an idea within, thereby changing their thoughts and tampering with their will. What Cobb is being hired to do is to mess with Fischer's thoughts and dreams and to incite him into breaking up his father's corporation; in return, Saito will use his contacts to free Cobb of the erroneous charge of murdering his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), thereby permitting him to return to the U.S.A. to live with his kids again. To do such a complicated procedure as 'inception', Cobb enlists the help of his right-hand man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a talented dream architect (Ellen Page), a wise forger (Tom Hardy) and a respected anesthesiologist (Dileep Rao), but he'll find that so many different imaginations pose a veritable threat to all their sanities including his own, which is plagued by the memory of Mal and her fictional appearance in all their dream sequences that aim to destroy their plan.To try and explain the plot in more detail is absolute madness; it's so complicated and multi-layered that I'm sure I'm not the only one who has trouble making sense of the entire mélange. But unlike other films whose complexity leads to their downfall, 'Inception' is enriched by it and the audience doesn't find too much trouble in understanding it all as the film goes along. Audiences and critics alike have called it 'mind-blowing' and, believe me, that's just THE right word to describe this feat. You'll feel dizzied and disoriented for many hours after the film's over because it deals with so many levels of consciousness and dreams, it poses so many existential questions and it furiously toggles between reality and imagination where we're dragged to question our own realities and our own convictions.Like any other Hollywood film, it's packed with almost non-stop action, thrills and special effects, but the intelligent dialogue, the excellent characterization and the frequent twists and turns always keep it interesting. It's one of those movies where the suspense grabs hold of you since the very first scene and doesn't let go until the credits start to roll. It has Nolan's name and reputation stamped out all over it, and even being close to three hours long, it's so fast paced you won't notice time fly by (it feels no more than an hour long). Simply stated, this movie reminds us why we like to go to the multiplex, why we love the movies: it's both artistic and entertaining.All of the acting is superb (I mean, just look at the long list of A-list stars it has, including Oscar nominees DiCaprio, Watanabe, Page and Oscar winners Cotillard and Michael Caine). The cinematography is perfect, the ominous score shatters your nerves, the production design is the stuff of dreams and the screenplay (its best asset by far) is as original and refreshing as they come. We're already in the middle of August and so far I must agree with what is being proclaimed around the world: that this is the best movie of the year so far! See it! I can't stress this enough.

The Blind Side," TRULY the leading lady of the year...
","As a cinefile, we expect two different (and often separate) things whenever we go to the movies to review a film: a) we expect a deep and intelligent story that will stir our minds and drive us into thinking about any number of topics and the artistry employed in interpreting them on screen, and b) we expect to be moved, touched, impressed, rushed, scared and/or any other verb which applies to making the film memorable and making it, more than a pastime, a viewing experience. Most importantly, it's a rare (and I DO mean rare) feat when a movie fulfills both expectations, and it's films like those that make us film critics rush at our laptops and start pounding away excitedly at the guilt-less keyboard. One such film is the one I've recently returned from watching, namely John Lee Hancock's 'The Blind Side.' The premise is simple and, to a point, overused: poor African-American kid with no hopes in this world and no brains to call his own gets the attention of a white, Christian family who help him smart up, discover his talent and subsequently lead him (through a number of emotional scenes) to success in his area of expertise, usually sports (football). 'The Blind Side' is the very same thing. It's a poor kid (Quinton Aaron), who looks retarded but is actually quite intelligent and who comes from an abusive, coke-inducing family in some ghetto finding a rich, happy, white family, spear-headed by a cocky, righteous and brave mother (Sandra Bullock) who gives him a home, helps him find his true self and discovers his latent talent for football, which is born out of an instinct for protection. As the kid, called Michael Oher, grows to love and care for his family, he begins to feel he's their protector, and from such intense protective maneuvers such as saving his little brother from a car accident or protecting Sandra Bullock from gansta thugs, comes out his great skill playing Defense on his school's football team, earning surefire attention from all major colleges around the country and close-to immediate success. All of this while understanding the true meaning of family, love and leaving a troubled past behind.Yes, the story is quickly growing stale, and that's the reason why it didn't attract me at first. But after Sandra Bullock won her Oscar for Best Leading Actress for this film, my curiosity got the best of me...and, oh, I'm so glad it did. There are two things (two VERY exceptional things) which make this an intelligent, engrossing and memorable film. First, there's Sandra Bullock's performance which I must admit is more-than-Oscar-worthy and which captivated me from the first second she's on screen to the last one when the credits roll. There you see her, crossing a school hallway ten minutes into the film, gorgeous in a designer outfit and talking heavy business on the phone with some associate. Five minutes later, you just KNOW this is a posh, fancy woman with an attitude and with more balls than anatomically-allowable; you really don't wanna mess with such a strong-minded, fierce woman. And after she meets Michael Oher, your preconceptions of Bullock's character melt away into a pleasant uncertainty and tridimentionalism, where we discover a strong woman with a gentle and caring heart, a whimsical and funny woman with a scared heart, all in one. Bullock has managed to take a single character and make an entire film all about her. You end up caring about this character as if it were your own family you were staring at. She's THAT good! The second thing is the dialogue which is as witty, quick-fired and moving as ever. The story is a 'tale as old as time' but the dialogue sets fire to the characters and to the plot, and out from the ashes of an overused story rises a phoenix of something refreshing, poignant and with a HUMAN heart we can all relate to. And, of course, most of the dialogue is dominated by Bullock, so you can imagine the quick, memorable, incendiary kind of thing you're going into.Yes, it's rare when a film is both intelligent and memorable...but that doesn't make it an instant classic. Sandra Bullock and the dialogue give this film a wide shelf-life, but the story (which is, in a word, unimpressive), the typical cinematography and the (uncharacteristically) muted score by Carter Burwell figure among it's low points. This film is not an instant classic, and I can't even say it's one of the best films of the year (although it DID earn an Oscar nod in that category), but it's among the films you'll enjoy the most and you'll remember for some time, complete with a reflectively-smiling face and a sense of fulfillment. You CAN'T be disappointed.Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!",8,0,0,21 April 2010
Trainspotting," A film that truly stands the test of time. A masterpiece!
","Danny Boyle's film masterpiece 'Trainspotting' is a vibrant jolt of life (however constantly drugged-out its characters may be) that transports the viewer into the shocking minds of low-middle-class people with the common dream of success and happiness which they think will be obtained by a constant intake of incredibly powerful drugs.'It's better than sex,' the characters agree as they continuously inject their worn-out veins with the drugs, subsequently dropping almost unconsciously to the floor in a vivid and electric dream of heavenly perfection. This is what life is about: joy, ecstatic happiness and a constant state of perfection. 'Drugs provide this for us', they realize, and if this is the dream every human longs for then it should justify their pillaging and plundering around Scotland to obtain it.The film follows a junkie (Ewan McGregor) as he alternately muses about the low state of human beings and the difficulty it is for him to live, and the utter paradise it is to consume the drugs that account for everything even remotely pleasant in his life. His best friends which include a loser yet humble and lovable junkie (Ewen Bremner), a pretty boy/Sean Connery know-it-all with a high image of himself (Jonny Lee Miller) and a drug-hater violent psycho (Robert Carlyle) all emphasize the alternately revered and reviled state drugs induce them into.Our principal character, the McGregor junkie, dreams of someday actually managing to quit drugs and getting himself a nice lifestyle like 'normal people' while recognizing and embracing the wicked jerk he actually is. The film follows him in a hilariously amusing odyssey into 'normalcy' and the missteps he encounters that are triggered by his friends' reappearance in his life.The plot of the film is very good, as a matter of fact, but what really makes this movie an absolute masterpiece is the artistry behind its every area. The music is psychedelically absorbing, the editing is simply perfect, and the cinematography is, well, electrically vibrant, hysterical, spot-on and artistic. The screen writing follows no ordinary pattern, but involves images, music and colour to exude the feeling of the movie.It's a perfect comedy, really. It's that kind of spectacular entertainment that awakens your sensibilities and makes you cackle in delight at the sheer audacity that's unraveling before your very eyes. I can't recommend it enough.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10,0,0,20 August 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Kids will love it, adults will ADORE it!
","Wes Anderson is my hero. No, really, I mean it! I mean, look back at all the films he's made: all the way from his debut masterpiece 'Bottle Rocket', to his elegantly poignant 'The Royal Tenenbaums', and even his box-office flop (but critically-acclaimed) 'The Darjeeling Limited' and all the others in between. He's a filmmaker that takes dark comedies and takes them to hilariously high and moving levels, and his screen writing (usually teamed with another excellent filmmaker, Noah Baumbach) is among the best that Hollywood can come up with. He's a man who seems not to be able to do a superficial film, and each character he creates has infinite depth and wisdom and seems much more human than any, um, Jerry Bruckheimer could come up with (even though his films ARE good, too).Whatever. The point is that Wes Anderson has surprised me beyond limits. Here is one of the masters of dramatic, depressing comedies taking a book written by Roald Dahl (one of the most whimsical and best-selling children's' novelist) and making it into a stop-motion animated film for the entire family. Impossible, you say? I used to say that too, but after watching the end result, I can declare that Wes Anderson's 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' won't disappoint any adult or child this year.Most of you already know the sinopsis of Dahl's book, but in a nutshell, the film is about Mr. Fox, Mrs. Fox and their son Ash who live a somewhat poor but content life in their burrow. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) used to be a chicken thief in his day, but after meeting Mrs. Fox and putting her in danger after discovering she's pregnant, he vows to stop the adrenaline-packed life of a chicken thief and becomes instead a columnist for a newspaper few people read. Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) seems to be okay with this, but Mr. Fox is going through heavy existential problems where his spirit is at unrest and where his animal instincts overpower him. Ash (Jason Schwartzman), their son, is a depressed and sour young fox who begs for society's attention but is usually overlooked or ignored because, let''s face it, he's unimpressive.Mr. Fox buys a beautiful, large tree from his real estate agent against the legal advice of his Badger attorney (Bill Murray), and it all seems ideal at first, but Mr. Fox is very much aware that his neighbors are none others than Bogis, Bunce and Bean, the three meanest farmers around...and also the wealthiest and the ones who farm and harvest the best chicken, turkeys and apples respectively. His instincts kick in, he begins stealing again, and soon finds himself in a heap-load of trouble. But, as the title of the film aptly highlights the word 'fantastic', this is no ordinary fox! Yes, it's a children's' story, and yes, it's a fable, but as much as it's fantastic and preposterous it's profound and intelligent. Obviously, Anderson has taken the artistic liberty of adapting the story as freely as his imagination (and his PG-restrained rating) will let him. He's omitted a character or two, he's added about seven more, he's stretched the story to include many more plot twists and he's given each character a roundness and a credibility that you'd never imagine seeing in a fox, a badger, a mole, or their likes. As in previous films, Anderson deals with topics such as existentialism, nature vs. nurture, not fitting in, dysfunctional families, excess of envy and, most of all, repressed emotion which will eventually explode in sudden bouts of depressing anger; yeah, definitely NOT topics for children...but how can I put it? Anderson has managed to tone himself down without reducing a smidgen of depth to a point where the film is adequate enough for children and marvelously moving for adults. Tell me, how many other filmmakers can do this? The dialogue is pitch-perfect, as always. The cinematography is grandiose and frames not characters per se, but entire settings; it makes the viewer feel like a voyeur including him or herself into these animals' life instead of simply an audience at a movie theater. Camera positions, cuts and dolleys add comedy to the events going on screen, and the sublimely country-ish score by Alexandre Desplat make this the perfectly-ambienced film.There are scenes of raw, heart-wrenching emotion: notice a scene where Mr. Fox fights with Rat during their second encounter, or the scene where Mr. Fox gives a toast at a supermarket; these scenes take your breath away and launch your brains into a cataclysm of thoughts and opinions about a wide array of topics. Notice other scenes, like the one where Ash is working at his chemistry school lab or where Ash and his cousin Kristofferson watch a train set in their room; these are incredibly hilarious, and speak of genius in each second of them. I think that, with the obvious superiority of Disney/Pixar's 'Up', 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is the second best family film of the year.See it! And have your children see it too. Films don't get any more rewarding than this! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10,1,3,25 April 2010
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," My favourite comedy ever!
","What does it take a film to be immortalized? What moves audiences and critics alike to carve a special place in history for them? James Cameron would argue that it's innovation in special effects; Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Jackson would have you know it's the depth of a story and its epic development through trilogies; Orson Welles was quite sure it was a film's ability to perform above its time and deal with perennial topics. They would all be correct, and their respective films have triumphed and remain must-sees to the world at large. But what would be Monty Python's answer to the above questions? How would the members of this perfect English troupe deal with the pure genius of their films and the depth of their comedy? They'd stand by the fact that, um, a good deal of moose, coconut-carrying African swallows, cheeky revolutionary peasants, 'Ni'-saying knights, Broadway-style numbers and a famous historian are the key to a great, pitch-perfect comedy that stands the test of time...and you know what? Even through their silliness, they'd be correct.Monty Python is a group of English thespians composed of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Just to read their names together makes the reader raise his/her eyebrow in amusement, for their household names, synonyms of pure comedy. Monty Python gave England its laughs with their satirical, modern and outrageous humour reminiscent of Peter Cook, Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett, and the few feature films they made together caused such uproar around the world that they're now considered utter classics by critics, film associations, cults, universities and families. 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', possibly their most iconic film, is my personal favourite.The plot follows King Arthur, who has only just retrieved Excalibur from its stony perch and has been informed by the Lady of the Lake that he's to become the greatest king ever. He now travels through the entire country searching for brave, wise, gallant knights who'd like to join him at his round table at Camelot. Sounds quite epic and historical, doesn't it? Well, it's anything but. The film is hilariously nonsensical, too outrageous to be believed, silly at its core; it constantly strays from the plot to present different ridiculous sketches of the knights, it presents events that are not only unbelievable but preposterous...it is, in short, a farce of what comedies and epics have come to be. But unlike other silly movies like 'Scary Movie', the film's parody is pure genius and manages to make heavy political, religious and cultural statements throughout, and the silliness is actually uproarious. I laugh every single minute of it, and younger audiences will find that, even if THEY'RE not doing so, the wit and intelligence underlying the ridiculous events astonish them. Audiences of every age and generation have found this to be a comic gem to be treasured.The film begins with THE wittiest opening credits I've seen to date. They're shown upon a black screen featuring ominous, dramatic music and Swedish subtitles. Through the course of the credits roll, the subtitles no longer translate what is being written in English but give out the weirdest, most non-sensical statements about moose; soon after the credits stop and a disclaimer announces that those responsible for the stupid subtitles have been sacked. The subtitles resume, and once again the disclaimer appears saying that those responsible for sacking have been sacked too. More credits appear, like 'Moose special effects,' 'Moose trainers,' 'Miss Avery's moose', 'No moose have been harmed in the making of this film,' etc...to the point where a third disclaimer appears saying that everyone responsible for the credits has been sacked and a new set of people have been quickly rounded up to finish the credit sequence, which grows sillier and sillier to the very end. The opening credits foretell the silliness of the film aptly, for the remaining hour and forty minutes is a wild and crazy romp that will have you in awe. Never (and I mean NEVER) has a film been simultaneously silly and profound like this.I can't name any particular scene to exemplify the film's genius. I rather have the reader rent or buy the film and be treated to its wonder without any warning of the surprises in store. There's epic fight scenes, outrageous musical numbers, heavy parody, controversial political and religious statements, interwoven modern scenes, some animation and, well, just about the best screen writing and acting I've ever seen. So...What DOES it take for a film to be immortalized? The answer is pure and simple: it needs to be the inspired work of geniuses, and Monty Python lives up to those standards.Please, if you know what's best for you, SEE THIS FILM!

Moon," Renews the audiences' belief that GOOD sci-fi films are still alive...
","Sci-fi is alive...and kicking! Watching Duncan Jones' surprisingly good sci-fi film 'Moon', I can now confirm that Hollywood can still produce a profound and moving sci-fi story, and that it takes the work of a true creative crew to produce it. In an era where sci-fi films are an excuse to attack audiences with a long and uninvolving demonstration of special effects, Jones attempts to revive the genre and add an involving story and well-developed characters to it, proving that special effects aren't everything, and that the old days of '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Solaris' still have an effect. Like a famous critic said, truly good sci-fi films aren't dead, they're just hiding.'Moon' introduces us to a near future, where humans have found an important source of energy called Helium-3, which comes from the moon and is trapped in lunar rocks; these rocks can be shipped to Earth and can be harvested to release a potent and natural power source which helps over 70% of the planet in an ecologically-benefit way. On the moon, there's a space station that controls the machines' harvesting of Helium-3 rocks, and this space station is manned by a single man called Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, in a surprisingly effective performance). Sam is completely alone in the station, and he supervises the harvesting and the well-being of the station, fixing the problems which seldom take place, making sure it all goes according to plan and sending periodical reports to Lunar Industries on Earth, updating them on the situation on the moon. The only company Sam has are the casual recorded messages he receives from Earth, and the ever-present Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey), the station's computer, a sort of Hal 2000.Sam is incredibly lonely, of course. He's spent three years living by himself at the moon station, talking to computers. The film is effective and troubling at showing us the critical mental state of this man, who's practically isolated from human contact, and who confirms, day by day, the meaninglessness of his personality; he's desensitized and goes about his daily routine monotonously, sadly, the wear being most apparent in his face. There's a moment early in the film where we see him get a recorded message from his wife and his young daughter; the amount of emotion and heart-break in this scene is the work of a genius, and we just KNOW that this is more than just a sci-fi story, but a true exploration into human emotion.On one of his outings supervising the harvesting machines, Sam sees something strange against the luminosity of the sun's rays, and he crashes his lunar vehicle against the harvesting machine. He loses consciousness, and then he wakes up in the recovery room at the space station...but here's where the story takes a weird and disturbing twist: how did he get to the recovery room from the place of the accident? Why is he suddenly feeling so strange? And why does he get the sensation that he's NOT alone in this space station? That's all I can say without disclosing any spoilers. Suffice it to say that from the moment he awakes at the recovery room, the film takes a steep and disturbing dive into tension, and challenges Sam's sanity to an unspeakable degree. The suspense of the plot mixes with Sam's uncertainty and the terrible toll it's taking on his mind to deliver a veritable tour-de-force to the viewer. Duncan Jones (who, by the way, is David Bowie's son) makes an excellent directorial debut in this film which challenges conventional storytelling and feels as fresh and as intriguing as anything you've seen before.The story is involving (I mean it), and it doesn't rely on your typical plot twists to gain its tension. It delivers the facts straight to the viewer, hiding nothing, but in the truth it conveys it forces upon our minds countless questions that we just can't wait to have answered. Rockwell is simply fantastic in his portrayal, and it is his performance, more than anything, which drives our attention. Spacey, with his coldly sweet voice, gives Gerty an ominous presence which we can't overlook, and we sympathize with the ship's computer and fear it at the same time. More than a sci-fi story, this is an exploration into the characters' mind, which poses questions dealing with the importance of human relations, human importance and the meaning of life.The only conceivable downfall of the film is the fact that it deals with such deep and intriguing topics, but after a moment in the film, it ceases to probe deeper and focuses on the plot instead. This is good, don't get me wrong, but it could have been done better. Nevertheless, as Jones' directorial debut, I believe he has fared much, much better than other débutant directors.The cinematography is very good, giving us wide-range shots which absorb the nothingness and the solitary expanse of the space station, forcing the feeling of loneliness and claustrophobia on the viewer; Clint Mansell's score is muted but effective, and this is good because it doesn't force itself on the viewer or the story, but it crawls beneath Sam's character, to a point where it becomes one with his personality. The editing is at a bit of a flaw, though; it tries to enhance the emotion by focusing too much on certain objects, but it fails at times (for example, there are way too many focuses of an animated smiley which appears on Gerty's screen, and this doesn't even come close to the tension we experienced by, say, the lingering shots of Hal 2000's red eye in '2001').Still, the small flaws the film might carry don't overshadow the overall power and depth it conveys. It's truly satisfactory, and like I said before, it renews our faith in the existence of GOOD sci-fi films. I thoroughly recommend it! Rating: 3 stars out of 4!",8,3,6,17 January 2010
Up in the Air," A unique film, unlike any I've seen before.
","Jason Reitman is on his way to become one of the greatest film directors of our time. Of an ostensibly young age, and with only three films under his belt, he has already proved himself as a visionary young director who refreshes the film industry and gives his movies the necessary combination of electricity and art that appeals to both mainstream audiences and art lovers. 'Thank You for Smoking', his directorial debut, was an astoundingly hilarious dark comedy with deep and poignant reflections; 'Juno' was a miracle comedy which revolutionized the teen comedy genre and which found its way into every household viewing experience. Now his latest film, 'Up in the Air', is yet another dose of genius, a dramedy that entertains as it ponders the precarious balance between work and family, dealing with every scene a jolting blow to our consciences and a permanent life lesson to be learned.The film introduces us to Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a highly successful man who lives for his one-of-a-kind job: firing people. He's the best at a highbrow company where experts at firing people are hired by other companies to do the dirty work for them. Ryan is forced to fire countless people he's never met before, day after day, and he's really good at remaining emotionless and calm through their reactions- ranging from openly crying, to pleading for their family's well-being, to violently throwing a fit, to threatening with suicide. And yet, after each grueling meeting, he emerges with a smile, ready to take the next plane wherever he's needed next.Ryan is a happy man, happy in his loneliness. He's comfortable up in the air, away from human connections, and thrives by earning wads of money, living in airports and keeping safely distant relationships with the few acquaintances he has. His friends are airport and store clerks who greet him happily as their patron, his girlfriends are casual women he meets at airport bars for a one-night stand, his family is the company he works for. What amazes audiences about this Ryan character is how coldly focused and intelligent he is- so much so that he acknowledges his loneliness, recognizes how isolated he's becoming, accepts the fact it may be detrimental to his well-being...and yet he relishes it. He lives for a fast-paced life traveling and earning frequent flyer miles.One day, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) comes along; a sensual, intelligent, successful woman he meets at an airport bar. Naturally, they hit it off right away, but through time and through many meetings with her, he begins to understand the sudden and unforeseen need for company. And with the arrival of Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young girl with fresh ideas and dating issues who challenges his working techniques and whom he has to show the ropes around the 'firing people' business, he begins to earn valuable life lessons and he begins to discover the deep complexities of the human condition...and how they're a deliciously bittersweet experience he can no longer live without.Naturally, the film deals with highly complex topics, and they really ARE complex. These are topics authors have devoted heavy volumes to, and they've been thoroughly explored and cross-section in endless psychology textbooks. In a two-hour film, and through a fascinatingly original illustrative story, Jason Reitman has managed to probe into the topics and wrench their guts out to be exposed to an awestruck audience. The sheer force and poignant situations in the film are sure to make the audience both gag with heartbreak and sigh after laughing. Like another critic said, 'it's a searing and delicious slice of life', and every second of the film rings with truth and comic drama that we can all identify with. Clooney is down-to-earth and believable, the two supporting actresses are a joy to watch; the extras hired to play the fired employees have actually been fired at some point in their lives, and they were asked to improvise their emotions based on past experiences...so you can imagine the raw emotional power of their short performances.It's an effective story driven by its pitch-perfect screenplay and its flawless performances. Notice how the drama and emotion happen by themselves, as naturally and as realistically as a film can convey. Rolfe Kent's score is quiet and creeps under the action to the point where you KNOW the music has become part of the feeling and not an enhancer; Eric Steelberg's cinematography deals no fantastic camera shots or dramatic camera effects, but includes every detail of the scene and makes us feel like actual witnesses of the action; it's us in that room, and Ryan is firing us. Basically, we're forced to take in the film as a whole and every technical aspect contributes to this wonderfully-crafted story.As with his previous films, Reitman pays close attention to every word of the dialogue. It's fast-paced, witty, but every syllable down to every pause is important and is rendered to perfection. This is surely the best screenplay I've seen all year (adapted from the novel by Walter Kirn). It's a film to meditate with, to reflect upon...but above all, to bask in and to marvel at. And it's a hell of a good time too! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10,1,4,15 February 2010
