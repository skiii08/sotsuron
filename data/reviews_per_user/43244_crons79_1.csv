50 First Dates," Wonderful Romantic comedy about a man (sandler) who falls in love with a girl who forgets everything the day before when she goes to sleep at night.
","50 First Dates is slowly climbing the charts and becoming one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I saw it two weeks ago on DVD. I was skeptical that it would be any good. Sandler has gone down hill with his movies from Waterboy and Happy Gilmore. The Wedding singer was cute, but not great. 50 First dates is great! It has enough comedy to keep the typical guy laughing and it has enough heart felt moments for the women out there. The movie will have you laughing the whole time. It also makes you really feel for both characters. The ending will have to feeling happy and sad all at the same time. Must see date movie! (Others in the top 5 are Swingers, High Fidelity, Clerks, Serendipity, and now probably 50 first dates!) Enjoy!",10,0,0,16 March 2005
