First Man," We all knew the plot, didn't we? Still...
","The most daring Human adventure of all times would probably take much more than 2 hours and 20 minutes to cover all steps it took before the Giant Leap, but this is a movie, so they had to squeeze it in some standard format. Unfortunately, of all things happening on the Apollo 8, Hollywood is yet again taking precious minutes of the film to depict all the living hell that The Wife is going through. I'm not discussing how important (or completely not) her role was, I'm pointing out reason people call this film - boring. If all these scenes were used for actual science, action and fuss on the project, it would make it more interesting.
Still, this true movie is worth watching. Most of the people are taking Moon Landing for granted, when this was completely suicidal mission. And these brave men took risk to make it.",6,0,0,17 October 2018
Bird Box," So stupid it hurts.
","John Malkovich! I love him! I'd really like to see him more on the screen.
Apart from that, this could be a novel in explaining how fu**ing dumb is this movie. It's so dumb that even a potential excellent atmosphere couldn't get it score higher than 4. But it doesn't even have an atmosphere. It's not even that exciting, it's just stupid on so many levels it hurts. But I guess normal person would expect something like that after watching a trailer.
The only question I had during watching this movie was - will it be worse than 'A quiet place'. And my oh my, it is.",2,3,5,12 January 2019
The Favourite," Interesting to fans of the queen(s) I guess...
","This movie has a wide target audience and that is where the positive reviews are coming from so don't be so surprised about high score.
For anyone who is outside the target audience, and has some wits - movie is shallow and boring. Completely predicable with a humor that will evoke few (if any) 'Huh!'-s from you in those long 2 hours.
To be honest actors are very good in their roles. Scenography although impressive - often repetitive.",3,7,12,12 January 2019
