The Avengers," the avengers
","The Avengers. I can't believe how impressed I am by seeing this movie. The first scene in which Nick Fury gets demeaned by Loki was awesome. The 3d content was good but not very good. In other words, the movie was a heck of a goddamn ride. Completely AWESOME! Robert Jr. as Iron Man was at his best. But, for me, the Hulk stole the show. The film was one of the best action-adventures I have ever seen and surprisingly their was a lot of comic content in it too. There is a scene when the Hulk punches Thor in such a comic way that you tears come to your eyes as you laugh. Thor was better in the Avengers than he was in 'THOR' but Hawk eye and Black Widow too did a heck of a job. To me, the film was an outstanding performance by all of the actors and Loki did his best as the villain. Still, the HULK ruled the movie! Mark Ruffalo at his best. AWESOME!",9,3,8,17 May 2012
2012," 2012
","The movie was great and they had John Cussack and all those wonderful special effects but still, the movie was a pathetic attempt to show how the world will end. Every once in a while buildings were falling, volcanoes were busting and the whole Earth was crinkling up like cellophane. But the emotional expressions of the actors were not enough, even the kids did a better job than the adults. The special effects were awesome and the ending was superb but still the film remained a tedious watch. The starting was pathetic,I mean people trying to save great works of art, building submarines, what the hell? We are talking of the end of the world for god's sake! Event the part when everybody is disagreeing to tell the public that the world is about to end. 'The day after Tomorrow' and 'Another Earth' are still better watches.",6,2,2,17 May 2012
Inception," inception=Mindblowing
","I had been wanting to see inception for a long time but when I actually saw it, it was like, 'what did just happen? Oh my god?' Christopher Nolan created the intense moment of reality versus dreams throughout the whole movie, you actually wondered that was that real or a dream? Dicaprio as Cobb was awesome. Even if you missed just one scene of the movie, you won't be able to understand it. Seriously, it kept me at the edge of my seat when I went to see it. There is this part when Cobb meets Mal in the dream world and it is so intense that it makes you shudder and bite your teeth! Inception was goddamn heck of a ride. You don't know what is gonna happen until the end. An intense thriller, Christopher Nolan made Inception a fantastic watch. seriously, Inception is worth every dollar you spend for it, don't forget the popcorn! Inception is truly great and a fantastic performance by Dicaprio keeps you at the edge of your seat. A mind blowing performance, it deserved every award it got and even more . Don't miss it for the world! Open your mind, and Inception will be one of the best flicks you ever saw.",10,3,9,18 May 2012
Fast Five," fast five- a good watch.
","A great film, I was impressed with the action sequences and really loved the Dwayne Johnson-Vin diesel action sequence parts. The moment they blow up the prison bus in the first scene, I knew this movie was gonna be fun.The following part after the bus trashing sequence is a little boring but the fun comes when they steal the muscle cars from the train. It was fun to watch this movie but I must say a little technical glitches and hard to believe concept in the later action sequences was kind of boring. Dwayne Johnson made the movie a great watch and the muscle cars were also pretty good. A had earned action fast paced movie but definitely one of the action movies of the year. This movie will turn out to be a entertaining watch, not the best in the franchise but still an entertaining watch. A hard earned movie, go for it!",7,0,1,17 May 2012
