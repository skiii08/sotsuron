Come and See," Kids at War
","Come and See is the original version of 'Saving the Private Ryan' movie by Steven Spielberg, he even correlated his movie to Come and See by Emir Klimov. This movie 'Come and See' had a really nice plot to it; really scary and gruesome. No wonder it was said that you will use all your five senses into this film, and that was really true; the film made me hear what the protagonist was hearing, it made me feel how they were suffering in the war, what they were going through, touch what they were feeling on their skin on what they were going through, taste what they were tasting by the foul face expression they were making, smell what they smelled and see what they was seeing, which really impacted me, it made me feel like as if I was going through what they were going, it gave me a sense of trauma by all the events that happened. Klimov did an excellent job in making his audience feel as if they were the ones experiencing what the protagonist was going through.",8,1,2,10 February 2012
