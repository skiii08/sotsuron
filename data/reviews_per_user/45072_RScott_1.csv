Miracle," Very inspirational event.....
",This single sporting event did more to bring people together then anything else could at that time and the movie does an outstanding  job of showing what the movie meant to us in the context of everything else that was happening at that time! Also kudos to the director for using Al Michaels original commentary rather than using an actor. This movie is easly one of the greatest sports movies of all time!!Kurt Russell did an outstanding job capturing Herb Brooks little nuiannces...it's a shame Herb didn't live to see this he would've approved!,8,0,0,27 February 2004
