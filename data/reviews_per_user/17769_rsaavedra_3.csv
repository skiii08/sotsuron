10 Cloverfield Lane," Unpredictable
","IÂ´ll only say, this movie gets good points for sheer unpredictability. Not many movies can achieve this feat.",7,0,0,11 January 2019
No Country for Old Men," Last 10 or so minutes shatter the potential this movie had
","Just watched this movie, which means, saw it after the Oscars had been awarded. But trust me, in this particular case I am completely comfortable saying that I am not biased at all by the Oscars. I am writing this review just amazed at how angry I felt when leaving the theater. I went there somewhat predisposed to witness a masterpiece. Well, loud and clear, for me this movie a masterpiece IT IS NOT!I perfectly got the point in the title: some criminals are just way too sick for old wise men to handle. That doesn't mean the movie had to get disorganized and unnecessarily leave unresolved scenes near the end. Absolutely infuriating!! Haven't read the book, I wonder if the book has that same problem, or if it was a creative license by the Cohen brothers? They might have been awarded the Oscars, but boy, those guys can really mess up a really promising movie.I give it 7 stars only because before those last 10 minutes it all had been built up as if it was a great movie.",7,0,2,10 March 2008
Grave of the Fireflies," The most beautiful elegy to all innocent victims of all wars
","A most unusual blend of beauty, and sadness, to display the cruel consequences of war. Slowly and steadily, as if in slow motion, we are slapped in the face with the miserable reality of the main characters, devastating and cruel reality, shown so simply and so powerfully from the very first to the very last second of the movie. Some parts literally smash your heart to sorrow. Graphically speaking the movie displays such a breathtaking look. Not just the sceneries and overall style, even minor details like the leaves and debris flying across the scenery in several shots truly resemble the paintings of Hokusai or Hiroshigue (which I happen to be very fond of). The artistic value of the visuals works perfectly in service of the powerful emotional substance explored in this movie, the combination is just perfect. There are several moments that I personally find truly poetic and most sublime in Grave of the fireflies. Forget whether you hate or enjoy war movies, or whether you like or dislike animated or manga movies. Grave of the Fireflies really stands far beyond any preconceptions you might have for these categories.",10,4,5,26 November 2002
