The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," intensity of sadness
","A beautiful film, with deep emotions revealed in ways that only Kieslowski and few others could.  I can see how this may have seemed pretentious, but trust me Kieslowski was one of the least pretentious directors in recent history.  His storytelling style unveiled things more gently and with greater subtlety than other directors, hence the pace.  A side note, Andie MacDowell was almost cast for the lead role(s).  Not to take away from Irene Jacob's amazing performance, but something about the thought of Andie in it intrigues me...",Null,2,5,1 February 1999
Independence Day," fooled me...
","I wrote off Hollywood films years ago, but was lured into giving them one more try by the ads for this film.  What I saw pretty much covered all of the things I don't like about Hollywood (same story being retold again and again and again, shameless, blatant manipulation of (some members of) the audience, presenting impossible problems with unbelievable solutions...).  I can't add much to the other negative comments that have already been written about this film except to point out another plot problem: beings who were thousands of years more advanced than we are probably would've dealt successfully with computer viruses before, not to mention have had components more advanced than/incompatible with ours...  Notice the difference between ID4 and War of the Worlds where human power never did stop the martians.",3,1,2,3 December 1998
Moulin Rouge!," Great 3rd act...
","But I never would have made it that far if I'd rented the video.  The first act was the world's longest music video (I'd seen enough after 2 minutes) and the second was pretty much filler.  If I'd gone to the theater alone, I might have walked out before it was over.  But I was with friends so I really couldn't.  The 3rd act was amazing and definitely made up for a lot, it was very passionate.  Overall, pretty good for a mainstream film.",7,0,0,26 September 2001
Life Is Beautiful," finally...
","This is the 4th performance of Benigni's that I've seen.  In the other three I felt that either I was missing something (that was as plain as day to Italians), or that he just wasn't quite nailing 'it.'  Well, this time I felt he did.  With much respect to the critics of his treatment of the holocaust, he managed to convey its brutality to me, ie when the children and elderly were on their way to being 'showered', the Germans shouting a bunch of harsh sounding and untranslated words, Jews being carried from their homes without a moment's notice...  Those scenes sent chills up my spine.  I really don't think anyone will ever take what happened lightly because of this film, (unless they were predisposed to taking it lightly before they saw it).  Rather than make light of it, I felt he was showing how far his character had to go, and how inventive he had to be to protect his son mentally and physically from the horrors that surrounded both of them.",9,1,3,10 February 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," The funniest movie I've seen in years...
","It's hard to know what can be added to what's already been said.  When I read the reviews, I picked this one because I thought it would be at least ok, but I had no idea how hard I'd be laughing.  Great characters, fun twists (sometimes I could guess what was gonna happen next, yet when it did I still couldn't stop laughing) and even cockney rhyme slang.  I'll be in shock if this isn't my choice for movie of the year.",10,0,0,5 May 1999
