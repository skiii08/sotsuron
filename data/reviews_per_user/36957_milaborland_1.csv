Marie Antoinette," A huge disappointment
","If I was watching this movie for historical purposes, I would learn nothing more than that Marie Antoinette was a frivolous teenager with an appetite for pink deserts and fluffy shoes. I would learn that she did not age in her 20 years at court and she spoke with an American accent. Oh and most importantly, that she listened to rock music.If Coppola was attempting to create a film that documents the boredom and tediousness that was the French court, she succeeded. Fortunately, there is much more depth to life of Marie Antoinette than Coppola offers and only offers, in the last 10 minutes of the film.I found myself checking my watch every 5 or so minutes waiting for this movie to end. What a shame that a story with so much potential got so brutally butchered!",4,1,2,17 September 2007
