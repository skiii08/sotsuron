Come and See," Holy cow - literally.
","Come and See follows a young Belarusian Flyora who wants to join the army and fight in the war. From then on Floyra's life and whole universe change to a point of no return.This won't be a very long review but this film had me going. Truly one of this most terrifyingly realistic war films i have ever seen. A child soldier who wanted to willingly fight, and all we do is watch as war takes everything that makes a young boy innocent away from him.This film extremely captivates the reality of war. I was left silent through out the whole film almost horrified by some of the incidents occurring on the screen. The Directing, Acting, EVERYTHING is just extremely captivating. There's so much i could say about this film but i want to try and leave this film completely spoiler free.All i can say is when you see this film, you will never forget it and though this film may be extremely horrific with some scenes its definitely a great piece of cinema.

Chinatown," 'You know what happens to nosy fellows?'
","Roman Polanski's landmark, marvelously complex, classic film noir masterpiece, which is a fascinating mystery which is set in 1930s Los Angeles. Private detective J.J. Gittes, played to perfection by Jack Nicholson in bravura performance which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, gets hired by a mysterious femme fatale named Evelyn Mulwray, played beautifully by Faye Dunaway in a brilliant Oscar nominated performance of great subtlety, to investigate her husband Hollis, the chief engineer of the water department of an extra-marital affair. Gittes is swept into a web of double dealings, deceits, political scandals and murder, all leading to an unforgettable and powerful climatic in 'Chinatown.' Masterful direction by Polanski, with a captivating and intelligent Oscar winning original screenplay by Robert Towne, stunning cinematography by John A, Alonzo, and an evocative, dynamic score by the late great Jerry Goldsmith. This tour-de-force benefits greatly from the superlative supporting performances by Perry Lopez, John Hillerman, Diane Ladd, Darrell Zwerling, Burt Young, Bruce Glover, and James Hong. Special kudos must go to the late great director and character actor John Huston for his magnificent portrayal of the perverted and monstrously evil landowner Noah Cross. Roman Polanski makes a memorable cameo appearance as a short, sadistic switchblade wielding thug who savagely cuts Nicholson's nose. 'Chinatown' stands as one of the true great classic films of 'the 70s. A cinematic treasure that was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director: Roman Polanski. Highly recommended.",9,1,2,10 February 2017

Creed," 'Time gets everyone in the end; it's unbeatable.'
",Ryan Coogler directs a fantastic spin off to the Rocky franchise that more than stands on its own. Michael B Jordan is sensational as the son of Apollo Creed who yearns to make a name for himself in the world of boxing. He searches out his fathers best friend and former rival Rocky Balboa to train him who is once again played by Sylvester Stallone in his 7th portrayal of the iconic character. Stallone gives his best performance in years bringing a real sense of emotion and tenderness and is now getting a lot of well deserved Oscar buzz. The fight sequences are also a wonder in themselves with exceptional cinematography that makes you feel like you're right in the ring with them. This is a true crowd pleaser and not only a reboot but a rebirth of the boxing film franchise. I wouldn't be surprised at all if we see CREED 2 rolling up in a year or so and it will be more than welcome. Highly recommended.,8,0,1,12 February 2017
The Hustler," PAUL NEWMAN IS THE COOLEST MAN IN HISTORY
","Hollywood used to be preoccupied with the deconstruction of human beings: who we are, our paradoxical behavior, what makes us tick (for the good and the bad). The Hustler is a prime example, a film about the corruption of the soul, about how bruised masculinity clings to vice in order to feel full. It's deeply tragic, but also deeply human. A complete masterpiece.",9,0,0,22 December 2019

So, when you combine all the elements, you got yourself a Western Masterpiece.",9,1,2,7 April 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Amazing. Hilarious. Still relevant.
",One of the films that you just have to watch over and over and over again. Peter Sellers is amazing and gives incredible and hilarious performances. This might be Stanley Kubrick's best film. Arguably the funniest and very best comedy ever made.,9,1,1,22 December 2019
Doctor Strange," 'Dormammu, I've come to bargain.'
","Marvel is certainly on a roll. Even the lesser known comic characters like Ant-Man and now Dr Strange have been brought to life successfully as blockbuster film franchises. Benedict Cumberbatch is solid as the lead and the film is a must see in IMAX 3D for the out of this world and truly spectacular visual effects. The supporting cast is decent especially McAdams as the love interest and Tilda Swindon controversially cast as The Ancient One. Sporting some of the most inventive spectacle since Inception, Doctor Strange marks another successful execution of the Marvel formula with dazzling visuals, a sharp sense of self awareness and an ensemble of solid performances, namely the commanding turn from Benedict Cumberbatch.",9,0,0,11 February 2017
Barry Lyndon," Pure ART.
","Barry Lyndon is a prime example of Kubrick stepping back from standard Kubrick and making something that baffles audiences. Much like Eyes Wide Shut , which opened in the nineties and was met with disappointment, this film, which was released in the 70s, often deviates from the director's standard directorial signatures.There is a loud and frequently remarkable score to go along with many of the scenes (and it really is a great score) and the running time, at just over three hours, is enough for someone to realize who is calling the shots in the editing room, but it feels more like a Spielbergian period piece than a Stanley Kubrick movie.It feels like an adventure, with our lead character constantly going through changes and frequently finding himself in new situations that call for different settings and when those settings change, we know we're in for another half-hour or so of fun (and sometimes intense) action.I loved it.",9,2,3,9 February 2017
Full Metal Jacket," Easily one of the best war movies of all time, and certainly one of my favorite Kubrick films.
","Full Metal Jacket states its primary concern fairly loud: Private Joker (Matthew Modine) is grilled for wearing a peace pin on his combat uniform while having 'Born to Kill' scrawled across his helmet. He responds that it is a comment on the duality of man, warring and peaceable. The film reflects this two-sided dilemma with a two-part story. The dialogue in both sections is a constant clash between the inflating, propagandistic, and sickly comic language of professional soldiering (aided by the immensely foul-mouthed drill sergeant Hartman, played by former Marine sergeant R. Lee Ermey) and Joker's more self- preserving enterprises, first as the tutor of the inept Pyle and then as the journalist reluctantly covering the military perspective of the war and just as reluctant. He is never truly the vicious fighter the Marines want him to be, but he is every bit as detestable as his more unthinking counterparts. Kubrick's particularly effective stroke was to purposefully ignore the politics of Vietnam and keep both sides of this generalized central conflict right in your face. Kubrick works expressly on this level of the individual and unspecialized grunt to create a film that is less a defense or criticism of war than a strike at the mythologies of war-making. In its constant and irreversible violence, Full Metal Jacket, one of Kubrick's grittiest works, is also one of his most resonant.",9,0,1,11 February 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," There comes a time when a man gets mad
","When John Steinbeck wrote THE GRAPES OF WRATH it became a highly controversial book, which eventually became a highly controversial movie. For my money it's a near perfect film. The direction by two time Oscar winner John Ford is spot on. He tells his story and it moves along at a very brisk pace. One thing I always find that bothers me most about older films is that the pace tends to lag, a result of the film not aging well or it never had a good pace. This film, upon release, was highly successful and earned several academy award nominations including nominations for best picture and best actor for Henry Fonda. Fonda plays Tom Joad, a man on parole who returns home and discovers that his family has been driven off their land and now must leave Oklahoma and head to the promise of work out in California. The film has a dark view of life in the depression, but to view it any other way in regards to this family's story would be doing Steinbeck's material a great disservice. The family has to struggle to stay together. Grandma and Grandpa are quite old when the journey begins; Rosasharn is pregnant and, to leave with them, Tom must violate his parole. The characters in this film are very relatable because of the idea of family. We can all relate to the various things the characters do to help the family and sometimes to get away from it. One of the films biggest assets is Jane Darwell's touching performance as Ma Joad, a wise woman who is the glue that holds together the family unit. This is a film that must be seen, it's a true landmark film and a cinema classic.",9,1,1,11 February 2017
Lion," The only 2016's film that got me close to shedding some damn tears.
","It's a story that normally would find its place as a Hallmark Movie of the Week or a crass commercial television production but in the capable hands of director Garth Davis and a great cast, Lion manages to bypass the easy sentimentality of many of its kind to provide a cinematic experience that is intensely moving and emotionally true. The first half is an incredible example of pure cinema when, in scenes almost devoid of dialogue, the young Saroo (played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar) is separated from his family. The second half doesn't quite reach the same cinematic heights as the first but the acting of Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara, David Wenham and a top-form Dev Patel anchor the narrative in a way that never renders a false note. All in all, a beautifully executed tug at the heartstrings.",9,0,1,9 February 2017

American Psycho," 'Do you like Huey Lewis and The News?'
","American Psycho is one of the most underrated and overlooked movies of all time in my opinion. The movie is amazing. From Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman to the dark comedy.Fearlessly aiming for the nastiest, darkest satire possible, American Psycho hits endless bulls-eyes and conceives one of the most memorable movie characters of the 21st Century, brought to life by amazing work from Christian Bale.As a character study, 'American Psycho' is pretty flawless. The audience is shown everything that Bateman does, be it a violent murder or his morning skincare routine, and is even allowed to pry into his thoughts through first person narration - a device that I usually dislike but is unavoidable in many adaptations.",9,0,0,9 February 2017
Judgment at Nuremberg," Absolutely brilliant.

Captain America: Civil War," 'Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth'
",Civil War blends the incredible action sequences and humor from The Avengers while also bringing real depth and pathos to plot and character that was done so well in The Winter Soldier. It really is every comic geeks dream come true to see these kinds of movies brought to the screen like this so well. The film is stuffed full of so many beloved characters yet somehow pulls it off. Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther is a fascinating character I am already eager to see develop more in his own movie and Paul Rudd as Ant Man is a welcome addition to the team and steals every scene he is in. Of course the biggest treat is Tom Holland as Spider-Man who reboots the character in the best way possible and gives much promise to his own movie franchise. The film is brought together by Robert Downey Jrs Iron Man and Chris Evans Captain America. These two actors are so well cast for the roles it really is impossible to imagine who will play them once the actors decide to move on. This is one of the best super hero movies hands down.,9,1,3,11 February 2017

No Country for Old Men," Anton Chigurh is one of the greatest evils in cinema - ever
","The film is set in rural West Texas, with the main character a welder and hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the remains of several drug runners who have managed to kill each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the sheriff Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), He decides to simply to pocket the 2 million dollars for himself. The result of that decision puts a psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), on his trail by the drug cartel. This killer is a dispassionate murderer of nearly every rival, bystander and even his employer in his pursuit of Moss. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart. This is a Coen brothers' team of direction and production that is beautifully terse and very intense. The film provides 'edge of your seat' and these quickly paced action scenes are tightly constructed and presented like a Hitchcock film with its almost morbid silence in the showing of the act of murder. Any lesser movie would seemingly dissolve into cat and mouse territory, by the middle of the film, but here there are more shoot outs and standoffs galore and the viewer begs to anticipate what is happening next, but cannot. Nothing is ever quite what it seems in this bleak but mesmerizing country, as Tommy Lee Jones shows up as a soon to be retired sheriff, and commands the screen by pumping the drama with morality and reality versus the mayhem preceding him. It is a very unique film that begs watching again and again.",9,1,1,11 February 2017

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," One of the Funniest crime thriller i have seen till date.
","Bacon, Soap and the guys have a plan. All 4 will put up 25K for a 100k high stakes poker game and make it rich, split the winnings. When Harry, cheats in the game the gang finds themselves oweing him half a million. Their neighbors are crooks and going to knock off some drug dealers. The gang decides they will rob the bad guys to get the money to pay Harry. Seems like a simple plan, and then things start to go wrong. A really good movie. One of Stathem's earlier flicks in which he actually doesn't fight. The movie starts out with 4 story lines that seem separate but then are all interlinked come the movie's end. It has some comedic moments mixed in too. The best part is the ending. It is kind of a choose your own adventure ending where they leave you just enough to decide how you want it to end of the gang. If you have not seen it and you enjoy Pulp Fiction type movies you will enjoy Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.",9,0,1,11 February 2017

Rosemary's Baby," Don't . Trust . Your . Goddamn . Neighbors .
","If you haven't seen Rosemary's Baby (1968) yet, you are missing one of the most beautiful yet haunting experiences you'll ever get in life. it'd probably hold second or third positions in my list of favorite horror films. Rosemary's Baby works because of: 1. Mia Farrow: this has got to be some masterful acting. When she felt a pain in her stomach, I felt it too. Her transformation from an independent and strong woman to a helpless weakling is done beautifully. The haircut is one of the best things that was done to further this weakness. Plus her acting is so real, so unlike the typical 60's acting style. She wasn't a dumb character, she knew her surroundings well. She knew something was up. Her confusion and fear was needed. 2. The rest of the cast: Ruth Gordon, and the actor who played Mia's husband (can't remember his name, John something) were breathtaking. How well they play their characters! Even at the end when you may expect a slight shift in their character, they don't. And it is all the more beautiful. 3. The story: the story of a mysterious pregnancy is fresh and frightening, and I'm getting tired of explaining this stuff so I'm just gonna list them out now. 4. The masterful direction 5. The colors 6. The script 7. The storytelling 8. The ending. A brilliantly executed Horror film that is easily one of the the most unsettling films ever made. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",9,2,4,10 February 2017
Steve Jobs," We will know soon enough if you are Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are.
","The best part of Danny Boyle's biopic is the whip smart dialogue one would already expect from screenplay maestro Aaron Sorkin and the solid performances from Michael Fassbender, Seth Rogen, Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels. This is strongly supported by a fantastic musical soundtrack from Daniel Pemberton. Where the film falls down (in my opinion), is in its structure. It has 3 segments: 1984 with the first release of the Mac, 1986 after the controversial firing of Jobs from his own company and his release of the NEXT computer and culminates in 1997 with his rise back to the top and release of the new IMac. Overall, The film didn't truly cover any new ground and left me still wanting to know so much more about what made the man tick. An entertaining and well made film for sure just not the masterpiece it could have been.",8,4,8,12 February 2017

The Bridge on the River Kwai," One of Cinema's All-time Greatest Achievements
","Wow this is still a powerful work. The Bridge on the River Kwai is David Lean's WW2 epic made several years before his masterpiece Lawrence of Arabia. It's not on that level of perfection, but it's still a damned great movie. They don't make films like this anymore. I remember being shown this film in a movie appreciation segment by a teacher in elementary school. I then would watch it every chance I got as I grew older. Alec Guinness and William Holden give what may be their best performances. Younger people raised on fast-paced CGI hyper-edited ADHD movies would probably complain that this is boring. Their loss, and dead wrong. THIS is how films should be made. Take your time with location work and character development. There is one particular shot in the jungle where the commandos are hunting a stray Japanese solder. They startle hundreds of bats from sleep, and the bats fill the sky. The shadows of the bats flicker on the jungle below, making the search even more difficult due to the eye being drawn all around to the shadows flickering on the leaves. Brilliant scene. If you haven't seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch it. 'Madness.'",9,2,4,10 February 2017
Stalag 17," The Best POW Film i've Ever Seen.

Clouds of suspicion gradually start to build up. Its quite different from most of the other POW movies that we are used to see & quite entertaining too. Wilder maintained the balance of comedy, drama, thrill & satire quite efficiently. There are two things that I liked most about the movie– the outstanding screenplay & some brilliant performances by the actors. Specially William Holden & Sig Ruman.I can't really think of any other movies that do this good a job of being simultaneously funny and serious, except maybe Dr. Strangelove.",10,1,2,9 February 2017

","Finally, an adult superhero movie totally worthy of it's hard R rating! Ryan Reynolds is pitch perfect as the titular antihero with non-stop wise cracks and a potty mouth. He more than carries the film which is very, very funny. Tim Millers direction and the action sequences are equally hyper violent and thrilling as well as the supporting cast, which is solid too. But again, this is Reynolds movie all the way and he more than makes up for the train wreck that was Green Lantern back in 2011. So yeah, Deadpool is pretty great. It's not perfect, but this unconventional superhero love story works on almost every level, and if you're in the mood for a good time, I'd suggest giving Deadpool a try.",9,2,5,12 February 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Free Bird
","Matthew Vaughn has built an impressive career directing smart and fast paced action movies from his film debut 'Layer Cake' to the eponymous 'Kick-Ass'. Here again, he shows how to stage action sequences like no other. Colin Firth is in top form and dapper as Harry Hart aka agent Galahad who takes on a young hooligan called Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton) as his protégé. The film has an excellent supporting cast, with Michael Caine as Arthur, head of the Kingsman service, Mark Strong as Merlin the gadget guy and a deliciously fun performance from Samuel L Jackson as Valentine the films main antagonist hell bent on world domination. The plot of the film does not so much matter as just sitting back and enjoying the madness that unfolds. Stand out scenes include a warm up fight sequence in a pub that first introduces us to Harry Hart and an all out gore fest in a Church that makes the infamous fight scene in 'Old Boy' look like a high school brawl. There is plenty of tongue in cheek humor to balance all of the violence. Highly recommended!",9,1,4,12 February 2017

","An absolute masterwork, the human being's dark sides as the main protagonists. Vengeance, hatred, betrayal, greed and what they bring with themselves. It's the deepest film that I've seen so far on Kurosawa's filmography. Visually beautiful, pure poetry in every frame and every death. There is strong symbolism on the red color and the fire. The history of humanity has been covered by blood and fueled with greed since the very beginning, among these beautiful landscapes, the human race have been destroying themselves no matter the family bond or friendship. Not only Kurosawa's best, but also the best film adaptation of Shakespeare.",9,1,3,9 February 2017

Spectre," Well I loved it.
","Spectre is the 24th bond film and Daniel Craig's 4th turn as James Bond. It took me some time to get used to his rugged turn as 007 but I was won over after the superlative Skyfall. This film is quite uneven in its plot and dialogue yet still satisfies. The plot revolves around a cryptic message from the past that sends James Bond on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci, who at 51 is the oldest and undeniably one of the most beautiful Bond girls) the widow of an infamous criminal. Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organization known as Spectre. Meanwhile, back in London, Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott), the new head of the Centre for National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6, led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White (Jesper Christensen), who may hold the clue to untangling the web of Spectre. As the daughter of an assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of Spectre, he learns of a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks, played by Christoph Waltz. The action sequences are thrilling and Dave Bautista gives a solid supporting turn as a menacing assassin called Hinx. The third act of the film is borderline ridiculous yet solid entertainment none the less that it should satisfy any Bond fan and serves as a superior action movie.",8,2,4,12 February 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Help me get one more
","After hearing so many glowing reviews I caught this yesterday and wasn't disappointed. Mel Gibson might be a bit of a dick, but we have missed him as a director. Here he is at his sentimental best, holding back no punches in his personal views and making a pretty good damned film to go with it. Hacksaw Ridge tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who still wanted to do his bit in WW2, and how he works during one of the wars bloodiest battles. I've never been a massive Andrew Garfield fan. Oh the boy can act, but he always has this look of someone who is hurt, pining for a lost love. He has always looked weak to me. In this he has grown up though. It's ironic that it takes a film where he won't hold a rifle to show that he is indeed a man, a telling tale for the world today. This is a film where everyone is just great, and it has a cast where that's the last thing you expect. Vince Vaughan is the rough and ready drill sergeant, with Sam Washington as the Captain in charge. Special mention needs to go to Theresa Palmer (so underrated, loving her more and more in everything she is in) and most of all Hugo Weaving, who may well garner an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a broken father. The film does tug on the heart strings and probably takes some of the truths with a pinch of salt but this is exactly the kind of film we need in today's political climate. It is directed with maturity and gusto. Mel is a director not afraid to get his hands dirty and when the action is needed, he is among st the best in a realistic portrayal.",9,3,8,9 February 2017

The Martian," In Space no One Can Hear You Scream
","This movie is a triumph on almost every level; script, acting, directing, cinematography and special effects are all top notch. It's one of Ridley Scott's best films in years as well as a career high performance from Matt Damon who commands the screen and bring so much charisma and a surprising amount of humor to his character. The story revolves around an astronaut being stuck on Mars and having to fight to stay alive while NASA works to bring him home. The 2 1/2 hour running time goes by almost too fast as the film is full of scenes of intensity, thrills but most of all plenty of laughs. It's an all round crowd pleaser the whole family should enjoy.",9,2,4,12 February 2017
