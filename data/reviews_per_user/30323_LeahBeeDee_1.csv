Hereditary," Interesting. Not scary.
","This was... different. Good. But not revolutionary. Not even 'really good'. Just... interesting and kind of cool. But hey, there are so many movies doing the same old same old just to please audiences, that anything that makes me laugh at times just because I'm enjoying how completely weird it is, is a good thing for me.The pacing was a teeny bit slow at times, and I saw the basic plot as soon as Annie met the seance lady for the first time in the carpark, but it was just an awesomely entertaining ride to watch it unfold. I do admit I was disappointed by the ending. It turned out to be very run-of-the-mill, and I was expecting after a 2 hour movie that was so unique that it'd have something different and unexpected about it too.I'm also left with the question of who possessed Annie in the end and how? She went from being as clueless and terrified as the others, then as soon as her husband gets killed she was gone and taken over as a sort of puppet by the creepy cult somehow. Why did it take them so long to have that kind of power?But anyway. It's not what most of us long for which is a truly terrifying horror movie, as they're so rare these days. But it sure is entertaining. I'll give it that.",6,0,1,19 October 2018
