The Sound of Music," A Timeless Classic!
","I credit this movie as the movie that really got me into musicals.I first saw The Sound of Music when I was 6 years old. My parents were watching it in the living room late at night and I hid behind a curtain to watch the movie because it was past my bedtime. And when it finished, I just fell in love. With everything. Just, I adored it. I got nearly every single of those beautifully crafted songs stuck in my head, and by the morning I was singing 'Sixteen going on Seventeen' all the way to school.It's the kinda classic that you have to appreciate, not just for its ingenuity, but it's ability to stay light hearted, joyous, and lively. Everything from the acting, the costumes, the settings, the plot, the MUSIC just cement it as thr greatest musical ever. No not just musical, but movie in general. It's one of those movies I have to rewatch it at least 3 or more times a year because I cannot recover from the pure feeling a joy it gives me. And for a movie that originated from the 60's, the quality is amazing! It never lacked substance.I'm purely glad that this movie won Best Picture of it's year. I watch this with my family at least once a year. We all love it. It was because of this movie I got interested in Musical theater, and I still am to this day.Always a special place in my heart.

Captain Marvel," The first real stain in the entirety of the MCU
","Look, it's not like the MCU hasn't had a few poor movies before Captain Marvel. We had pretty messy movies like Iron Man 3, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor: The Dark World. However, all of those film's can later be looked back on as stepping stones to further progress the story and characters so that actions the characters make in later films make sense.But this movie was just...bad. This was not a good movie in terms of continuation in the MCU and just not good in general. Carol Danvers is by far the worst character in this universe. She's too cocky, narcissistic and downright too overpowered, with her only in movie flaw is that she has no flaws.There's my problem right there. You see, having a naturally cocky ego being a part of your personality isn't too much of a problem as long as you start to develop into something more than a jerk. As seen with Tony Stark in Iron Man 1 and Dr. Steven Strange in Doctor Strange. Both start off as arrogant, narccistic d- bags at the start but throughout their films they learn humility and begin to become more humble after experiencing eye opening experiences.Carol Danvers does NONE of that. She never develops. Her nonexistant arc fall flat no matter what. Everything she says sounds extremely condensending, she has to undermine the integrity of other characters, and she doesn't work at all for her powers. It's just given to her. Nothing else. Just boom. Mind Captain Marvel, everyone else in this universe actually worked for their position. Thor was a god that had his powers stripped from him entirely in his first movie. Had to regain his title as being worthy and struggled with that throughout his films. Tony Stark was selfish and self-centered until he was kidnapped and saw the liability of his actions when Yinsin died protecting him. He sought after trying to prevent innocence casualties and any harm coming to those he loved by struggling to make functional suits to protect people. And you got that over the course of 3 solo films and an additional dozen crossovers. Carol just has it because she has it. Thats it.Her snark is very demeaning, and that lies on Brie Larson's poor portrayal. She doesn't have the charisma to pull it off. In fact, her portaryal is dull. There's no spark to it. And it's making me quetion Larson's acting skills. Which is genuinely a shame because I saw her in Room and she was phenomenal in it. So good that she even got an Oscar for it. So what happened here? She just couldn't carry this movie. Which is such a shame.Now, for Nick Fury. This one hurts me the most. I'm all for some 90's nostalgia and I love me some Samuel L Jackson, because who doesn't? His portrayal in the MCU as Nick Fury has always been great. But, this 90's Nick Fury doesn't coencede with the Fury we've seen in the original timeline. How is he this jolly and open when in movies like Iron Man 2 or The Avengers he's such a rogue in the shadows? It just doesn't line up. People can change, but you're telling me HE LOST HIS EYE TO A CAT?!?!?! WTF? Are you kidding me? I just.......,WHAT?!?! I watched The Winter Soldier randomly on a whim before watching this and there was a scene where Fury is talking to Cap about his eye. He specifically said, 'I lost my eye because I trusted someone.' So what the hell? Does that mean he was lying? Was he ashamed? Because this movie makes it to be that a cat scratch made him lose his eye. This movie destroyed the lore over Fury's past. So now it's hard to enjoy Fury's scenes in the previous films.The only good things about this movie were the Stan Lee tribute in the title sequence at the start, The de-again effect on Sam Jackson and the Shield agents, the cat (despite the Cat ruining Nick Fury's character), Mandelson and Jackson's acting, and the Cree aliens.This character being in Endgame didnt make a damn difference. She could've been left out and it wouldn't be different. Captain Marvel was introduced too late and poorly. If this character is gonna stay in the MCU and Brie Larson is gonna stay playing her, they better change her act and Larson better up the acting game, otherwise her character will ruin phase 4 a lot.Such a shame.Rating- 2/10",2,3,6,11 April 2020
The Irishman," Pretty weak...ESPECIALLY for someone as great as Martin Scorsese
","Look, I adore Martin Scorsese's movies as much as the next guy. I mean, how could you forget some of his brilliant films like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and The Wolf of Wall Street ? Credited as some of the greatest of all time and some of my personal favorites. However, I was not impressed by this movie. And quite frankly, I haven't been impressed with Scorcese for a while now.Those are words I never expected to come out of my mouth, but they did.So where do we start? Honestly, as far as movies go in general I don't have problems with long movies. Hell, I've probably sat through longer. But for a movie that is almost 4 hours long, this movie in truth should be more like 2 hours long because it kept dragging at the start and towards it end. The movie had some good parts in the middle, but that's it. Only a few good parts and the rest was lacking. The plot was getting over repetitive. And it just became boring to watch. Some scenes were actually laughable to watch.This movie feels like a remake of Goodfellas with Jimmy Hoffa. Don't get me wrong, Scorcese SHINES in the mobster genre, and it's why this very movie feels like a copy of his previous movies with new characters thrown into the bunch. Bringing back De Niro, Pachino, and Pesci is endearing, cause this feels like a safe guard for them since those kinda gritty roles gangster roles are what they're best at. The whole time watching I didn't feel like I saw anything new, being that you could predict the end within an hour. Scorcese is sticking to his roots, what can I say. He's bringing back his acting darlings. A few good scenes here and there, but nothing really changed for me. I think the last Scorcese movie I was impressed with was The Wolf of Wall Street, and it was because Scorcese showed me he can shine in non mobster films, and it was refreshing to watch.I have a mixed reception with de-aging actors in film. If you take a 40 year old actor and are trying to make them look about 3-5 years younger, it works fine because the change isn't as noticeable. However, if you are taking a 50-60 something year old actor and trying to make them look about 20+ years younger, you've kinda ruined the realism you were trying to create. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are outstanding actors and I'm not denying any of their acting talent in the slightest. But I feel like they were physically done dirty in terms of the VFX that was done to their faces. Seriously. Is it too hard to find younger screen understudies for Pacino and De Niro? That was the most unnecessary aspect of the movie. Also, there was this one scene in where De Niro is kicking a man out of a store, and it was so awkwardly shot and acted in that one scene, that I laughed.While in truth this movie could be classified as great, I find it pretty weak for a Scorsese film. Very forgettable. I don't think I'll watch this specific movie for a while. Not worth the almost 4 hours. I appreciate the work, but I'll take that pass.Final score- 5.1/10",5,2,6,19 March 2020
Suicide Squad," Man....
","What was this? That was just awful.It started off good introducing all of these great and promising anti-hero characters that DC really nails in the book (Literally in the comics and The Dark Knight. FAR more preferable to start with if you want to invest in the DC universe), and then it goes downhill. There was no meaning in this movie at all. We get all of these cool moments, but where is the story? It became nothing in the end.I gotta say, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, and Will Smith all carried this movie on their backs. I say that in the best way possible. But dear lord. As much as I like the guy, NEVER put Jared Leto's Joker back in the DC universe. EVER! This movie, in a way, shafted his career into a low. And for an Oscar winner, he was just really disappointing in this film. Easily the worst Joker I've seen.I guess the score and costumes were fine. But jeez, Pass. Pass. PASS!!!!!You want a good DC movie, I'll happily direct you to The Dark Knight and Joker (2019).",3,0,1,28 April 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Still one of the best MCU movies to date.
","Honestly. Where to begin? Look, I adore Tony Stark. A personal favorite character in the entirety of all MCU, but I gotta say, Captain America always busted out the best titular solo films in MCU and this movie is proof of why Captain America has the best movies.Just everything. EVERYTHING about this movie was just so amazing. Couldn't live with watching it only once, so I went back to watch it 4 more times and it was still great. You got direct reccuring conflict from the first Captain America movie. Bringing back old foes and having them conspiring underneath the good guys noses and exposing S.H.I.E.L.D for its own corruption by its own commanding Nick Fury. Just to show you even the 'good guys' get their hands dirty too for selfish reasons when they feel they have to.You get a building companionship between two of the core Avengers that DID NOT end in a romance. Which was surprising to me that this movie didn't just go for the classic guy and girl work together and eventually fall in love trope that Hollywood uses so often. And the best part was that Johansson and Evans lovingly sold the chemistry, and it almost lead me to believe that they're characters would begin a relationship. And despite everything those characters went through together, the bond between them stayed professional and comforting in the end. How very well played Marvel. Very mature.The Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes is still one of the most intimidating and most formidable villains in the MCU of all time. He still beats Thanos. Every time he showed up on or before he showed up, you could always feel a lingering sensation of eerie dread for what's about to come next. It's thrilling and terrifying. The Winter Soldier is the epitome of 'Silent but deadly.' Sebastian Stan was just outstanding as the Winter Soldier. Easily one of the strongest performances in the film. He nailed that deadly assassin with no remorse or second thoughts and also nailed the confused and lost feeling of not knowing where to find the true Bucky he was. Sebastian had to play two completely different sides to one character and nearly made me cry in his final moments with Cap. Also, not only was The Winter Soldier a great character, but it was smart that they reintroduced this semi-minor sidekick friend character from the first Captain America movie who we all thought was dead, dug him out of his 'grave' and turned him into a shadowy deadly villain who struggles to break from the mind control that's forcing him to become a soldier of death. The strongest aspect of the film.Also loved how this movie gace screen time to Natasha and Nick Fury to really show off their skills in espionage more so than the other movies they were featured in. It did right by both of the characters by giving some levity to them and established them way more. Especially Natasha because we are only told of her skills and shown that she's capable of weaponry, but we didn't really see a lot of her espionage to use. We got a bit of it in Iron Man 2, but this movie highlighted her for who she is. Also, even though we know what kind of a character Nick Fury is, it showed us how capable, strong and manipulative he really is. I just loved seeing him during the Car scene assassination attempt on his life. Samuel L Jackson always knows how to give a performance.I'll just say it again, EVERYONE gave a delightful performance. Evans, Johansson, Jackson, Stan, Mackie, Redford, and everyone else brought their A-Game. Great acting, realistic conversations, and epic lines that are just so fitting to the characters they portray. The emotional sentiment in some scenes was just right on the money.Ok now. Now, we're talking fight choreography. My heart could give out, but whoever choreographed those fight scenes needs more than just an Oscar. I cannot reiterate how and why the fight choreography in this movie is the best in all MCU. Maybe Civil War comes close, but this movie has some of the most bone-chilling fights I've ever seen in any action film. Just...that highway fight between Cap and The Winter Soldier terrified me with glee if you can understand. Some of the most intricate fight I've seen. The way the shield and knife were handled was just above and beyond. As much as I adore the elevator fight in this movie, the highway was better.Music was chilling and emotional too. Nothing more can be said. I just love how the composer was so dark on incorporating Bucky's scream from when he 'died' in The First Avenger and mechanalized it into the theme for the Winter Soldier. How eerie and devastating. Just love it.Gosh, what a movie. Best MCU movie ever. Even after Endgame and Infinity War, still the best movie ever. The only movie that could possibly beat this would have to be Civil War. That being said, as far as a spy-action thriller, it was just right about everything. Still incorporating that nice humor for a darker toned movie like all Marvel does. The best understanding of these characters since Iron Man and The Avengers.Just brilliant.10.3/10",10,1,1,4 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Endgame: The textbook definition of payoff
","I have been following the MCU since 2008 when I was 9 years old. I still remember the first time I watched the trailer for the first Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and I BEGGED to my knees to my parents to go see it. After I left the theater with my dad I just remember never shutting up about it. I just adored it. 9-year-old me didn't know that Iron Man was just the beginning of something bigger that was to come.Over the last 11 years, we saw the release of 22 movies (Excluding Far From Home even though it is technically the last movie of this phase). 22 Marvel movies consisting of origin stories, trilogy's, crossovers, and more. Over hundreds of actors in a brilliant family-woven cast. Thousands of crew members and over 1000 minutes of screen time over the course of all the movies. Breaking box-office records everywhere. Each one told a new story that was unique, new, and fun. Even though there were a few misses here and there, you could always feel like the story was building to something new. Kevin Feige and the Russo brothers knew how much this 11 year journey was to people like me, and it really showed in this film.First, I'll get my negatives out first, because all MCU movies have some negatives. Some have more than others. I really despised what they did with Hulk and Thor. 'Fat-Thor' was funny at first, but then he became really insufferable to watch. Hulk was bizzare and they really didn't do right by his character. The Hulk I saw in 'The Avengers' wasn't here, and this interwoven Banner/Hulk didn't do it for me. I'd say the time travel plan sounded dumb at first, but Tony and Steve's time travel scenes were great to watch because it was nice seeing them revisit earlier established scenes. I think that Natasha's death was beautiful, but no funeral? She is one of the most deserving members of the team and deserves that honor. Also, I'm disappointed that they didn't really tie up Steve and Bucky's relationship. I don't have a problem with Steve going back to the past, living his life with Peggy, and giving his shield to Sam. But, they could've concluded Steve and Bucky's friendship arc way better, cause after all those two have been through together, you'd think we'd have a nice scene between them. Also, there were moments of complete and utter cringe in this movie. Like please, don't drag fortnite into this. That all woman shot in the final battle was very forced and cringy to watch. No problem with feminism in film or TV, but it shouldn't be too forced. And that is what it was. Rhodey was kinda awkwards and out of place in this movie. So was Captain Marvel. But that's it for the complaints.Alan Silvestri and his scores man. Music was spot on all the way throughout. I will never forget the iconic Avengers theme and the way it was incorporated was just...can someone give him an Oscar? Please.I'm gonna keep some of the scenes as my wallpaper because the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. The most pleasing effect and settings I've seen in my life.Fan service is so much more satisfying to watch. For all the people who say fan service is a bad thing- In this context, it's amazing.Hilarious moments like 'America's a--' (Thank god for Paul Rudd) and the Captain America 'Hail Hydra' moment in the elevator (Russo's literally waved a middle finger to the comics, and it was beautiful and funny). Strangling baby Thanos. Ha! And the odd test aging of Scott Lang was great. Comedy was on point.Then came the satisfying parts. I love Natasha Romanoff so much. She is one of the best female characters in the MCU next to Scarlet Witch. So watching her sacrifice herself was very fulfilling to everything she has been built up to be. She sacrificed herself for the Avengers, which she considers family. That was the best way she could've possibly gone. Bummer she wasn't in the final fight, but it felt right. The fight between the Avengers trinity (Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America) and Thanos was divine. These 3 fighting off a mad titan like Thanos together was worth it. Seeing Cap wield Mjolnir was just satisfying to the T. Always knew he was worthy, this movie cemented it. Look, I waited a full decade to watch all of these stories, characters, and plot intertwine into one moment that I will never ever let go of. The moment all of our dusted heroes return, and Captain America with his shield and Mjolnir saying, 'Avengers......Assemble.' I just, I couldn't take it. I literally got out of my seat in the theater like everyone else and cheered my a-- off while holding off the tears. This movie was like a reward. A reward for the decade long investment. I am not ashamed to say I left the theater nearly weeping like a baby when Tony Stark died. This man literally started everything. He kickstarted this universe to the top. I hate to be that person, but Marvel has now definitivly crushed DC. Tony was one of my favorites, so watching him die felt like watching a part of me dying as well. It even hurt worse because the second they introduced his adorable daughter, I just knew in my heart that something bad happens to Tony. 10/10 best way to end his arc. Sacrificing himself for the good of humanity.That funeral scene was expertly shot, and whoever held the camera there deserves an award. And then, finally giving Cap the chance to have that dance with Peggy made me so happy. You don't know how much I wanted Cap and Peggy to have a reunion so they can finally have that dance that Cap promised her way back in his first movie. That was the best way you could've ended it.Even the end credits was nothing short of a masterpiece.I started nearly bawling when the original 6 avengers started signing off one by one in the credits. I am genuinely proud of this cast. All of them have risen to better things, and lord. When RDJ signed off, that was it for me and my theater. A standing ovation and the screen went black.This era of MCU movies is over. That 9 year old me is grateful to have been able to have experienced this journey. This incredible journey. I am looking forward to the future, but it won't feel the same without Iron Man and Captain America. But it's time for the new age of Avengers.To the cast and crew- I love you 3000!Final rating- 9.1/10",9,0,8,10 April 2020
Coco," Yeah...I wish I had that box of tissues in the theatre. Pixar has done it again!
","I'm just a natural sucker for animated films, which is why I just adore Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks and all of those animation studios for giving me a childhood. Now, Pixar has produced many amazing animated films time after time, and have received plenty of worthy accolades. I can never forget watching movies like Toy Story, Up, Wall-E, Finding Nemo and such. Because all of them have made me tear up no matter how much I tried holding it in. The fact that animated movies make me cry more than a vast majority of live action dramas just tells you what kinda of a person I am. You can make a very good story, but you're gonna need a lot of emotion to make me tear up or cry in my seat.This movie was...AMAZING!I just..........,how can a movie be so lively, so adventurous, so inclusive and true to the cultural roots it's incorporating, and yet make me, a 25-year-old nearly sob in my seat at the end? Well, I'll tell you, only Pixar had gotten me crying in the theatre. Kung Fu Panda 2 did the same, but this movie just brought a new level of storytelling.You got this young Mexican kid named Miguel, who grew up in his family's compound where his family banned all things music because of a tradition his great-great-great grandma enforced after her husband abandoned her and their daughter. It's a movie about trust, mending broken ties, fighting for your dreams, music, and family.I can't tell you how beautiful this movie is. The detail, the lighting, the setting, the MUSIC! But one thing I adored was how it stayed so close to the Mexican culture it was portraying. Now, it's very easy for movies to use real life cultural customs in their movies and never add any significance or whitewash them. Never once did I feel like this movie whitewashed anything. This was the most accurate portrayal of Mexican culture I've seen in animation, and what a beautiful story it was.The music was special. I have a young niece who shares my passion of animated films. She's was 7-years-old when I took her to see this movie with me because I wanted to spend time with her. I just want to say, 'Remember Me' became our song. I learned the guitar part just so when we're together we can sing it. She adored this movie with her heart just as I do. There's been a lot of memorable Disney/Pixar songs, but this movie produced some of the best music I've ever listened to. I'll never forget it. My niece is now 10 and we still sing this to each other. It's adorable.Can I call it the best movie ever?Yes. Yes I can. And I'll do it now-Best Movie EVER!Just watch it. You need to watch to understand why I said this. Perfect for the family. A pure tear jerker worth every bit of praise it got.Final rating- 11/10Thank you so much Pixar for yet another great film!",10,0,0,6 April 2020
La La Land," I tried my best to love this movie.
","I am a huge fan of musicals. Whether they are movies or on Broadway, give me any musical and I'll listen or watch it and about 79% of the time, I will instantly fall in love. Now, this was one of the most anticipated movie musicals to be released since Les Mis, and just as a musical fan, I was jumping up and down for weeks to watch this because of all of the hype around it. I was watching what critics were saying all over, and some were calling this 'The Best Movie Musical of it's time.' I'm not the type of person that allows critics to form a general bias for me. I watch what they say, and go in with my expectations in middle ground. Depending if the film is good or not, my opinion on the movie either increases or drops to the floor.So what did I think after leaving this movie?Bored and uninterested to be honest. I really didn't like the first hour of the movie. I wanted to try, but at least with many movie musicals the songs are appropriately placed to progress the plot. The placement of the songs were so random. Like so random that you wouldn't believe. The whole first act it basically goes, mini conversation, then song, then montage. That's basically it.My second gripe with this movie. The singing. Holy hell. Can I just say, award for highest amount of autotune in a motion picture musical's soundtrack goes to La La Land! The singing, especially at the start sounded so artificial. The ONLY two really well sung songs that are not completely washed with autotune are John Legend's 'Start of Fire' (The only real proper singer in this entire movie who doesn't need auto tune) and the 'City of Stars' duet between Gosling and Stone. Even though it's very clear that those two aren't singers in the slightest, their vocalization there was their best singing in the entire film and I can appreciate that. Also, City of Stars was probably the best song of this movie. Which is kinda ironic since that is the recurring love theme between Mia and Sebastian.My third gripe with this movie? The plot. Hhhhhh. Basically, to put it short. Girl with big dreams meets guy who also has big dreams. They both hash it out with each other, plan to help each other out, go out on a date (Done through a musical montage), kiss, move in with each other, both are making their dreams come true, things don't go as they wanted it to, their dreams are interfering with their relationship, their careers don't work out, they breakup, girl moves back in with her parents, guy is depressed about blowing it but wants to make it up to her, finds her parents house, guy talks the girl into never giving up on her career, girl goes after her dream again, they say 'I love you,' and years later they are living their lives separately and finding success, and the movie ends with this bizzaro montage of the life they wanted together and movie ends. And that's it fellas! That's it! So another classic Hollywood A meets B story. If they were gonna do this classic reused trope seen thousands of times, they couldn't have twisted it to be something unique? It has all of the hallmarks that make it a musical, but the story was tediously stale. So predictable. It took me about 25 minutes into the movie to predict how the rest of the story went, and it all happened, and I was still bored.This was considered the 'Greatest Movie Musical of it's time?' I'm sorry, but even as just a movie, this movie was horribly bland.However, there are a few good things to this movie. That being the lighting in some of the set pieces and settings was beautiful. Some of the most vibrant lighting I've seen for a movie supposed to be homage to the 90's. The directing is amazing and hats off to Damien ChazelleThe acting from Emma Stone was great. Gosling kept that monotonous tone through most of the movie, so I just got bored of his character right away, but he stepped it up towards the end in terms of acting. But their performances were heavily undermined. The best acting moment from the both of them was the table argument by far. And that was the probably the best highlight of this film I could take away from this.So all in all, this was probably the most over hyped thing I've seen, and it's the most overrated Movie Musical I've seen, when there are much better movie musicals out there. Didn't live up the expectations since it was technically the same generic forced love story.I'm actually really glad it didn't win Best Picture at the Oscars, and sighed a breath of sweet relief when Moonlight actually won. Because this movie musical is doesn't hold water to the current holder of the Musical Best Picture winner, which is Chicago. It just couldn't be the musical best picture successor. It can't be in there with other leagues of musicals like West Side Story, The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, An American in Paris, Oliver, and Chicago.And as I continued writing this review, the star count went down. I started my rating at a 7 and now I'm settling for 4 stars. Because this is the most forgettable movie musical since BOTH Cats movies. 1998 and 2019. But to be fair, I don't want to compare it to those awful movies, it still way better than both Cats movies in general.BUT... but, if Broadway ever decided to take this movie to the stage, I think that's worth watching, because I'm always open to Broadway, and I always try to give new shows a shot. And even though I don't like this movie in the slightest, maybe a stage version could make up for it. I don't know. Maybe. And I'll even buy tickets to see it.My final score is a 4.
Thank you.",2,0,4,29 April 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Saying this movie is perfect is underestimating it as a whole.
","Like the genuine bine of what perfection looks like in film. And honestly the greatest comedy/drama I've seen. Scorcese hits all the marks again with this movie. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect cast. If it were up to me, I'd nominate a lot of people in the cast for an Oscar in this film, because the performances were like you've never seen. DiCaprio, Hill, Robbie, and Chandler were amazing.Going into this I had my doubts about Jonah Hill because I'm used to seeing him in these comedic roles and I didn't think that he'd fit in well in Scorcese's movie next to people like DiCaprio. Going out, I was thinking Scorcese has got his new Pachino, just like DiCaprio is his De Niro, because he was honestly was the second best part of this entire movie (Obviously Leo was #1). I will NEVER underestimate his acting skills agian. In fact, Hill should take on more roles like this, cause he's amazing in them.Look, as a biographical movie based off the real life events of a scumbag, I thought it was gonna be boring. This movie NEVER failed to catch my attention. I had my eyes GLUED to the screen. Everything from the screenplay, the acting, the directing was just captivating. It was supposedly 3 hours long, but I felt like I was sitting in my seat for about one hour because I couldn't feel any tinge of drag. Even from the get go at the start I was intrigued. Just jumped right into it. This movie didn't hold back any punches. As a comedy it hit EVERYTHING. I lost my near  in so many times. I don't know exactly what scenes are meant for the laughs, but I was laughing a lot. So the humor is A+. As a drama, I felt the tension, due in part to amazing acting and amazing script.So many people complain about the excessive
nudity, crude nature, and language in his film, but geez. It's R rated for a reason people! Don't get too much on your high horse for it.The one thing that I hate about this movie was the after effect of it on the real world. Jordan Belford, the guy who this movie is based off on, gets more attention for being a complete jackass and for his past criminal deeds of tricking a lot of people into going broke. It doesn't sit well with me that he gets a positive end from it. But that's just me. He deserves a whole lot worse for his past abuses.This has gotta be one of my favorites movies of all time. And I'mma be sticking my neck out on a line, but this is one of Scorcese's best movies ever. It just is to me.10/10. Utter perfection!",10,0,0,9 May 2020
Parasite," What did I just watch....?
","I hate myself. I hate myself for not seeing this movie sooner.Holy hell...that was just...INCREDIBLE! This is seriously the greatest film I've sat through. This was the biggest emotional rollercoaster I've ever been through. Give me any genre, this movie will cover it masterfully. This was a masterpiece. A masterpiece that greats like Martin Scorcese have yet to feat. You have no idea how hard that is for me to say because I adore Scorcese's movies. And like many, I regard him as one of the greatest filmmakers of our time next to Spielberg.Bong Joon Ho can't get more possible praise because his work, and his breathtakingly talented cast was just amazing! I think I just watched a classic. A modern classic that will be studied for all time to come. I was happy that Parasite won most of their awards at the Oscars, including establishing a landmark for the Oscars by being the first non-english film to win Best Picture. But after watching this masterpiece, If Parasite didn't win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, and it went to films like Joker, 1917 or OUATIH, it would be the worst Oscar year in history.I'm telling you, if you don't watch this, you can't consider yourself a true movie lover, because this movie has made it practically impossible for all succeeding Best Picture winners to live up to this.WATCH IT!

Marriage Story," Depressing, but realistic in a gut-wrenching fashion. And I have to side by Charlie.
","Look, I'm in quarantine and I had nothing better to do, so I sat through all the 'Best Picture' nominated films from this year's and singled out 'Marriage Story' and 'Two Popes' as the only two movies out of that bunch that I didn't watch. And Marriage Story was a far better movie to sit down and watch than Two Popes in my opinion.The acting was just...phenomenal. Everyone in this movie acted their chops off in the most heartbreaking way they could. Henry's actor (Sorry, forgot his name) just made me depressed in a heartfelt way. He was the hardest to watch in every scene because I just hated to watch him favor his mom in front of his dad, be fought over like tug-a-war, and looking lonely when he was with his dad. I just couldn't... I simply just wanted to cry with his presence if you understand. I hated having Charlie just watching his relationship with his son fade. Adam Driver, like the kid, broke me. At the beginning I semi-sympathized with Scarlett Johansson's Nicole, but by the middle towards the end, the movie easily made me side with Charlie, even though he's no better.I get that in divorces there's a bad side to each person that has to shine at some point. And at each point, I did come to hate both the leads because of actions they've done, but at the end, they're just humans. They made mistakes, and now one wants to move on understandably. But yet, for the one who wants cling onto a broken relationship and attempting to keep a legal fight going, I sympathized with him more because it was tough watching him hit rock bottom to fight for keeping some form of custody with his son, while simultaneously losing everything and his whole life just to maintain custody.But Nicole also deserves to move on with her life without having Charlie's life consume hers.It got ugly between both sides for sure, and this was hard to watch. But it was a very solid story that made all for a good film worth watching, with a great set of acting and direction.My only complaints would be that but felt too repetitive and slow at times and some scenes felt out of place and random. The crossfading was just awkwardly edited to move on to other scene too. But those were my concerns.In other words, a nice heartwrenchig tale. One for memory. Not perfect, but still not too forgettable.Final rating 8.4/10",8,1,3,5 April 2020
Black Panther," Most overrated MCU movie. Not worth the praise (A critique by a die-hard Marvel Fan)
","I'm a MASSIVE Marvel fan. I've watched every single movie from Iron Man 1 up to Black Panther (At the time. Watched all the films after this) and I don't understand the praise this film got. Why? For what? A prominently black cast? Really? An all black cast and this film is credited as one of the most groundbreaking and best MCU films of all time?Well you're sadly mistaken.I saw Black Panther debut in the MCU for the first time in Captain America: Civil War back in 2016 alongside Spider-man, and let me tell you, the mysterious, rogue bada-- I saw in Civil War was nowhere to be seen in this movie.The writing, story and consistency with past MCU movies was enraging. I saw this in theaters and I wanted to scream at the screen at times because of how contrived this entire film was. The fights and CGI? I literally wanted to die with laughter after watching the fight with Killmonger and T'Challa towards the end. It was animated like something out of a PlayStation game. Which is even more insulting to PlayStation, because their animation is way more advanced and thoughtful. Felt like it was a rushly animated the night before the premiere. The fight choreography was just bad. It wasn't memorable. In fact, that goes as saying all the fights in this movie were forgettable. I cringed every 10 minutes. The chemistry between the characters felt forced. I half blame that on the actors (Sorry Chadwick and Lupita) but mainly blame it on the writing. The romance was not there. Couldn't feel a thing for the relationship these characters had with each other.I walked into this movie thinking I was gonna get a great MCU movie origin story about this character that was thoughtfully introduced in a previous film, I walked out angry thinking this was one of the most disappointing MCU movies since Iron Man 3, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor: The Dark World. They downgraded Black Panther' s character. His characerization was so boring, dull and uninspired in comparison to his character in Civil War. Such a shame. He was close to becoming a favorite.I just can't believe this was the one MCU movie to get the recognition and the major awards. An Oscar Nomination for Best Picture? Are you serious? Followed by 3 other Oscars wins and a SAG. This was more like a politically driven praise more than a real constructive praise. I am now going to name all the MCU movies before Black Panther that were way better and more worthy of the awards and praise this movie got and still got bashed by critics: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Avengers, and Captain America: Civil War. Way better films, way better acting, better action, and better plot.I am a black woman and this movie was boring as hell to watch.Blade was a black superhero, and he barely gets credited, yet his movies were better. I'm sorry, Blade handled it better.If I ever want to rewatch all the MCU movies again just to relive the experience, I'll skip this movie alongside The Incredible Hulk and Captain Marvel.Final rating 2.1/10",2,2,5,6 April 2020
Me Before You," Romantic Dramas are often a hit or miss
","But this movie brought a very solemn smile and tear to my face when I watched it. I genuinely loved this movie. I had two reasons to go watch it in theaters when it came out. 1.) I love Emilia's performance in GOT and wanted to check this out. 2.) I have been needing to drag my boyfriend out to watch it with me.In the end , Clarke and Claflin have great chemistry, and my heart truly broke when the movie was coming to an end. Most people who hated this movie have told me 'Oh, it promotes the suicide of the disabled,' but that isn't true. I have a friend who is disabled. Paraplegic, and she basically lives in her wheelchair except when she needs assistance to get to other places. I wanted to get her view on it, so I took her to watch the movie 2 weeks later. When the movie finished she was in tears. She gave me a pat on my lap and asked for a hug and whispered 'Thank you' into my ears. She is a huge sap for romance movies, she explained how it was touching that a movie was touching on the idea of people on life support who find it a struggle to survive. She said that yes, it was unfortunate that William wanted to end his life, it made her happy to see that he was cared for by person who loved him and he didn't die in vain, but with a sense of fulfillment.Maybe it might send mixed messages, but hearing firsthand from a friend who basically told she knows what its like to be William that this movie wasn't insulting to her made me happy and brought a tear to my eye. Humanity is failing to know what love truly means. People tend to go the looks, wealth and lust in relationship at first, but we forget the friendship, the bond and company that love brings, which is why so many relationships fail nowadays. And this movie shows that everyone is deserving of a chance to love. Even the more challenged people are deserving of love. This movie sends a lovely sentiment, and I am glad I saw this movie.",8,7,8,4 January 2020
