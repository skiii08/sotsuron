Lucky Number Slevin," Totally Surprised Me!!!!
","This film took me by surprise. It is an excellent movie with a compelling story, wonderful acting, and brilliant direction. I have not seen this intense a movie since The Departed.Josh Hartnett is excellent in this film. One of the best performances I have seen him in. Sir Ben Kingsley is terrific as well. The character he portrays is outstanding. Lucy Lu seems somewhat annoying although that can be said about her character more than herself. Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci deliver good performances but overall, I think Bruce Willis came out on top. I will be using the nickname Goodkat for a long time to come. His character is terrific and no-one but Willis could play that character the way Willis does. He has such a serious and laid back attitude for such a deadly assassin.The story sucks you in brilliantly. Just like The Departed, I was compelled more and more to continue to watch. The story had grasped hold of me and I could not stop watching. Of course, more and more became revealed which built it up for a shocking turn of events (if you did not see it coming). Don't try to guess ahead of the film, watch in unfold and enjoy where it is going.There is plenty of action in this film. Bruce Willis shows us again why he is a brilliant action star and why he is a natural born on-screen killer. I also had a fond liking of the music in this film. The opening sketch is now one of my all time favorites.I really don't know how to describe this movie except as Outstanding. Paul McGuigan has created a masterpiece in my opinion. The only thing I can suggest is watch it! You won't regret it!",10,6,8,8 November 2007
3:10 to Yuma," Obviously one of the best westerns ever made
","Even the biggest critic could realize the potential this film has. The only thing you have to do is look at the cast. Christian Bale, Russel Crowe, Ben Foster, Alan Tudyk, Peter Fonda: a better cast could not be asked for. Although you can assume the film will be good based on the cast, you should expect 3:10 to Yuma to be a good movie which it is. 3:10 to Yuma is probably the best modern day western film.The cast delivers in this film. Christian Bale has a good performance as a good hearted rancher named Dan Evans. Russell Crowe delivers a terrific performance as Ben Waid, a dangerous and disturbed character. His character is an absolutely unstable and deceitful criminal. His character is just as dangerous psychotically as his character is physically aggressive. The best performance comes from Waid's right hand man, Ben Foster! Foster's character is just as dangerous a criminal as Crowe's character if not even more dangerous. Foster captures the anger and ferocity of his character in such a beautiful performance which makes his character dangerously scary. Peter Fonda who plays a bounty hunter and Logan Lerman who plays Bale's son, Will Evans, deliver two great performances as well. The casting of this movie was chosen perfectly and the performances were delivered just as well.The story of the film is perfect. It is a very gripping story and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I was expecting more from the film in terms of gunfights but the film delivered in showing a brutal, violent, and vulgar West. The film took not only an approach of showing how violent criminals were back in the Old West but also showing how vulgar they were and just how mentally unstable they were. I absolutely loved the film for that. One of the central themes surrounding this film is morals. You will see this theme continually evolve more and more throughout the film. The ending is more than what I expected!! I did not expect the movie to end the way it did and put it simply, 'The $hit hits the fan!'The music of the film is terrific. It fits the tone of the film perfectly and adds to the tension of the film. The film is shot beautifully with what seems like little reliance of special effects which makes the film fantastic.I know this film is a remake and I have never seen the original! But I can say this movie is absolutely fantastic. 3:10 to Yuma is a must see film whose brilliant acting is the pinnacle of the film. Westerns don't come around very often anymore and when they do, they come out in the form of 3:10 to Yuma; A True Masterpiece!",10,1,6,15 September 2007
Spider-Man 2," Best Spider-man Film
","Spider-man 2 is a perfect example of a film with a good story with lots of action, drama, entertainment, and has a good love story. This film surpasses the first one and despite the fact I had high expectations for this film, those expectations were sufficiently met. This is the best spider-man film.Sam Raimi returns as the director in this popular movie series. This film covers the emotional battle of Peter Parker and it is handled perfectly. Peter is torn between his duties as Spider-man, his responsibilities as a student, and most of all, his emotions. The result is Peter is uncertain what he wants and what he should do. The ultimate theme, the true test of a hero! What are the choices that Spider-man makes and the actions of those choices. They will define and determine the fate of his character, Spider-man. This story of Spidey's problems is handled perfectly alongside the story behind Doctor Octopus. The special effects in the movie are very good! Although some of the effects at times seemed obviously fake and way overdone! One of which I disliked was the Spider-man/Doc Ock battle on the skyscraper! Other than that, the special effects of the film were very satisfying.Tobey Maguire returns in perhaps his best performance of the movie series. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco are back as Mary Jane and Harry Osborne. I think Franco has a better performance as Harry in this film over the first film. But yet again, just as in the first film, the villain steals the show. Alfred Molina portrays Dr. Octopus. My personal favorite spider-man villain aside from Venom. He handles the character terrificly and the character is used perfectly as well. A good hearted man trapped in a mechanical and 'superior' intelligence. Molina has the appearance and attitude of Doc Ock. He takes a very serious approach to Doc Ock which is very satisfying. He is a dangerous threat instead of a sometimes viewed old, crazy, and laughable villain. One of the best performances by an actor on a super-villain. He did not disappoint. J.K. Simmons returns in his humorous role as J. Jonah Jameson and Bruce Campbell makes a hysterical cameo appearance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May and in this film, her character is more influential than ever! Her character has always been important to Peter but in this film her role is most significant. She has always been there for Peter but in this film she is able to provide Peter with the most wisdom and guidance he has ever needed. Her character is perfectly portrayed in this film. She is used as a pivotal necessity which is exploited wonderfully.Just an outstanding movie with an outstanding story and an outstanding usage of secondary characters! One of the best comic book films ever made and a true compliment to the Spider-man character. A fantastic film! The only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10 is that it does not seem as captivating as other movies. It is a good film but I do not really get sucked into it near as much as I do with movies I give higher ratings. An outstanding movie, a must see by spidey lovers and spidey haters alike.",9,12,19,24 June 2007
Batman Returns," Impressive Sequel
","Tim Burton has done a wonderful job in bringing another top notch Batman film. The film itself may be equal to the first. With Keaton as Batman returning, we get 2 new big villains, The Penguin and Catwoman! They are utilized brilliantly in this film. Batman Returns is a terrific movie! Michael Keaton does a better job in this film with Batman! I get more of a darker interpretation of him in this film and I like it better than the first. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Catwoman and she does a fantastic job! She creates a sick and fiendish catwoman who is a joy to watch on screen. An excellent portrayal of the character on her part. Christopher Walken plays Max Schreck, a business villain. His character is nothing truly special but Hey, its Christopher Walken. I still feel as if there is a lack of supporting cast outside the big three in this film.Danny DeVito plays the Penguin. Burton and the writers Daniel Waters/Sam Hamm take a different approach to the Penguin in this film. Rather than making him a simple mobster or ganglord like interpreted in the comics, Burton gives him the 'insanity' characteristic that most Batman villains have. So now the Penguin can be similar to having the mental psyches of other villains like the Joker or Two-face. And best of all, he does it successfully. The character is terrific. The Penguin is portrayed as a troubled, angry, disgusting, and disturbed individual. And some of his characteristics are kept true. He still looks like an absurd villain and seems like a laughable villain. Yet the character gets a very serious approach taken to him and it is done very well. DeVito does a good job of playing that character created for him.The story is very good! I love the opening scene and the opening credits! Although the movie seems really rushed at first in order to get the balls rolling! The action sequences are great in this film. And the special effects are even better. This Gotham City is even darker than the first one and it just expands the viewers imagination even more. The interpretation of this Gotham City is truly Gothic! A nice adjustment is made to Danny Elfman's original theme that gives the music a newer feeling.Batman Returns is a good sequel to the first. Tim Burton did a great job handling these first two Batman movies. It urks me that he was taken away from the series because the industry thought his interpretations were to 'dark' or 'scary'. That is what Batman is all about and Burton did a good job handling him.",8,0,0,2 July 2007
X-Men," First Good Comic Book movie in a long time
","X-men is the first good comic book movie in a long time. It began the Marvel age of movies and was a precursor to other Marvel movies such as Spider-man, Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Bryan Singer brought a fresh and original style to this film which made it a great movie and a great start to the Marvel age of movies.The casting of X-men is one of the film's best characteristics. Patrick Stewart is perfect as Charles Xavier. Hugh Jackman brings a ferocity and laid back attitude to his character Wolverine which is fantastic. Rebecca Romijin delivers a terrific performance as Mystique and Ray Park is excellent as a repulsive and sick Toad. James Marsden, Famke Janseen, Anna Paquin, Tyler Mane, and Bruce Davison all deliver great performances as well. The standout actor is Ian McKellan as Magneto. He captures the seriousness, vibrancy, anger, and devotion of his character perfectly. His portrayal of Magneto is one of the best movie villain interpretations of all time and no better actor could have been picked for the role.I really like the story behind the movie. The X-men must face off against the Brotherhood of (Evil) Mutants. Each of which is a distinct team of mutants fighting for a different goal. The X-men wish to protect humanity which of course ultimately hates and fears them. The Brotherhood looks to 'destroy' mankind for the same reason. Each team is driven based on their own personal beliefs and experiences. The thing I love about the X-men movies is that it is more than just a battle of good and evil like Spider-man. It is a battle for acceptance and once you see the movie, you should be able to understand exactly what I am talking about.X-men has one of the best opening scenes to a movie. Not only is it a great way to start the film but it is a great way to introduce Magneto's character. So much can be shown about Magneto's character in just that 5 minute scene. I love the way Singer started the movie.Bryan Singer does such a great job in bringing the X-men to the big screen. He captures the teams spirit, the characters attitudes, and the moral beliefs of what everyone is fighting for. Not just what the mutants are fighting for, but also what mankind is fighting for. The X-men make such a great film in that the issues behind them make for a compelling and meaningful movie.",9,0,1,29 September 2007
Spider-Man 3," Good movie but does not match the caliber of the first two films
","I do not want to call this film the worst of the spider-man films because I say the same thing when I say Batman and Robin was the worst of the Batman Films. And this film is in no way comparable with Batman and Robin. Spider-man 3 is a good film but does not match the caliber of the first two films.Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) and Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane) return in the two big roles with OK performances. James Franco returns in his best performance of the three films. He portrays an angry, distressed, and loyalty-torn character. It is truly a solid Harry Osborne character and I give compliments to Mr. Franco for doing so well in this third installment. Thomas Haden Church did an awesome job as Sandman. I was very happy with the Sandman character and the way he was created in the story. I loved watching him fight and the visual effects done on Sandman were outstanding. Some of his powers seem to be exaggerated but his character is great. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock and the new big villain, Venom! I would say Grace does a good job with the Venom character created for him. I still disagree with the Venom/Eddie Brock characters they created in this film. He is too cocky, too arrogant, and too much of a 'wimp'. Although looking at this as just a film, he does a pretty good job. OH, and Bryce Dallas Howard is in this film as Gwen Stacey. Although her role is of no importance, it simply enhances two factors in the film. That is all her character does, she plays no critical/event changing role.Although I would say this is the darkest and grimmest Spider-man film (which I liked, this film had almost a different feel for it than the other two), it is also the funniest. J.K. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) returns in his hilarious performance as usual and Bruce Campbell delivers yet another hilarious cameo. Even Topher Grace is funny at times (in a sick sort of way). So although the film is dark and grim, there is still some good comedy in it.This film tries to fit a lot into a movie. They overflow the film with a lot of new characters who need introduced. Overall, they do an OK job but it could have been handled better. So it should be fairly enjoyable as a film with entertainment and a good/solid/overrun story. You will notice the tag-line for this film, 'The Battle Within.' I do not want to give away anything so just think about that line. Peter is obviously going to be torn apart by perhaps someone or something(?). The story revolving around 'The Battle Within' is fairly good for a movie goer not judging the movie on its comic book characteristics. I think some of the effects are too 'video-gamish' in this film. They are almost completely recognizable as fake. The best fight sequences are in this film which should be obvious since he is battling three villains. Spidey, you have completed an excellent trilogy up to this point. This third installment is a good film. Maybe not the best way they could have gone out, but it was certainly good enough. A must see for anyone who enjoyed either of the first two Spider-man films.",7,0,0,17 June 2007
Taxi Driver," A Dark Film that is a Masterpiece
","Taxi Driver is an absolutely stunning film. One of Martin Scorsese's original masterpieces that was nominated for best picture in 1977. This film is absolutely amazing in that nothing is wrong with it. It has wonderful acting, direction, writing (screenplay), and filming.There is nothing wrong with this film. The filming is absolutely phenomenal, some of the best filming I have ever seen. The dark and horrible images of New York City are captured beautifully on camera. The footage taken from the Taxi Cab is brilliant, giving us the feeling we are driving that cab. The viewer gets the feeling that they are seeing and even feeling everything that is happening. Absolutely brilliant camera work! The story is brilliant. It focuses around the actions of a disturbed individual (Robert De Niro) who drives a Taxi cab during the most dismal times in New York City. The result, is an increasingly growing anger for all the filth and scum that he sees around him living in the city.Robert De Niro portrays a psychotic and isolated Taxi Driver named Travis Bickle who is a Vietnam veteran. This is, in my opinion, De Niro's best performance in a film. His character is extremely unstable and his portrayal of the anger, hatred, and cockiness in his character is phenomenal. The intensity he has on screen is unmatched by only a handful of performances I can think of. This is Robert De Niro at his best. Jodie Foster plays an extremely convincing young girl who Bickle tries to save from the scum of the city. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle deliver wonderful roles as well as Harvey Keitel, who plays the pimp named 'Sport' who you just love to hate.The ending of the movie is brilliant. I did not see it coming and it actually made me feel good. There are plenty of different interpretations about the ending and hopefully you can come to one you agree with after you see it.The film is so great in that little things make it amazing. One example, is the way Robert De Niro delivers his lines. They come out so smooth and invigorating that you are left captivated by him. Not just his lines, but other quotes from the film that leave you shocked or laughing. Another example, is simple actions performed by the characters. De Niro is not just amazing in how he talks, but also his actions. Small things like when Bickle smiles or smirks and when he points his finger to his head and starts to make gun shot noises is incredible. And the background music at that point is amazing. It really adds to the intensity of the scene.Taxi Driver is a masterpiece. I truly believe this film beats out Raging Bull as De Niro's best performance. A must see film that has remained one of the most brutal and cinematic masterpieces of all time.",10,1,2,12 July 2007
Watchmen," All depends on how you go into this movie!
","I will make this review short and sweet cause I can sum up this movie in a short and efficient manner. You all need to know something about me. I am a huge movie fan, but first and foremost, I am a comic fan. And I am completely capable of drawing the line between comic book and film. What makes a great comic book film is its ability to keep true to its origins while transforming it to the real world. I have always been skeptical to making a Watchmen movie because I have always sided with Alan Moore on this topic. I think Watchmen delivers its most powerful effect in its true medium and that is the world of comics and not the movie industry. That being said, Watchmen is a phenomenal film for us comic fans. It sets a new bar for the phrase 'Sticking true to the comics.' However, for some people who have not read the comic, it will be filled with a lot of twists and plot turns which may make the film confusing. It may be very convoluted and dense to some. This was proved by my friends who asked many questions throughout the movie since they never read it. The costumes and dialogue may seem cheesy at times. So, if your a comic fan, you'll love it. If your a regular movie-goer, you will have mixed interpretations. But if you are a comic AND movie fan like myself who keeps the two mediums separated from one another, you will both like and dislike it at times. But nonetheless, it is a great film. Kudos to Jackie Earle Haley and his performance of Rorschach. I could not have been more pleased with this performance!",9,2,6,8 March 2009
Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-man makes An Amazing Film
","Sam Raimi has taken perhaps one of the most popular comic book characters and turned him into a movie star. The result, a huge franchise that has launched into a huge success. Spider-man is a terrific movie with good casting, a good story, a good theme song (courtesy of The Amazing Danny Elfman), and amazing special effects.Tobey Maguire fills the role of Peter Parker perfectly. He has the appearance and the attitude of a young Peter Parker. His appearance is enough to convince me he is good for the role. He looks like he was born for the part and he does a fantastic job of filling it. I have been somewhat skeptical about Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. I never pictured her as being the Mary Jane type physically although she does a good job with the part. I have always been skeptical with James Franco as well. I do not think he did a fantastic job as Harry Osborne and I still ponder on him being cast (although he had a much better portrayal in Spider-man 3). His character just seems to outgoing, to selfish, and almost annoying(?). Willem Dafoe, in my opinion, stole the show. He plays Norman Osborne and the villainous Green Goblin. An absolutely perfect choice for the character. He has the anger to play the character and the ability to transform characters (From Osborne to the Goblin) easily and perfectly. His mental psyche is absolutely perfect for the character. I will admit, I did not really like his costume, but that is just his costume! His character is perfect! And there is some comic relief in this film, J.K. Simmons plays an unforgettable and perfect J. Jonah Jameson (editor in chief of the daily bugle).The story is very good though I feel the movie starts out awkward. I do not like how they really rush into Spider-man's transformation and the movie seems somewhat off tempo to start. The entire initial movie sequence up to when Peter's Uncle Ben confronts him in the car seems just rushed. After that, it seems like the movie moves more smoothly. Other than that, there is little I have to dislike about the film. The special effects are amazing and the design work done on Spidey's costume is terrific. The fight sequences are great and the final showdown between Spidey and the Goblin is awesome. The entertainment in this movie is high quality. Spider-man is a hero people feel they can relate to. He has duties that he feels he must commit to as a superhero and he faces real life challenges and personal problems outside of that life. This movie does a great job of capturing that.Whether you think of Spider-man as being 'Amazing' or 'Spectacular', either of these words can be used to describe the Spider-man film.",8,0,1,17 June 2007
Die Hard 2," Good Die Hard movie but not a great film
","Die Hard 2 is a perfect Die Hard movie. It has the characteristics and makings of a great Die Hard film. Since I am a huge Die Hard fan, I think the Die Hard characteristics of violence, action, and vulgarity are enough to make it a pure entertainment film but it falls short of being a good movie. Although John McTiernan does not direct this film, Renny Harlin does a good job with this sequel.One problem I have is the acting. I think the film falls short of the other films in a line of supporting actors. Bruce Willis of course returns in his star role of John McClane. His character is just as witty and humorous as ever. The other good performance was Dennis Franz as Captain Lorenzo. His character was extremely funny. A beautiful addition to the film who is just a nuisance and pest to McClane. I am somewhat displeased with the villains. I do not really like William Sadler in this film as Colonel Stuart. He just does not come off to me as being that evil or manipulative like Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons. His character just seems kind of stale and melancholy. I feel the same about the army commander Major Grant who was played by John Amos. There are some good secondary performances but I think some of the major characters were not handled that well.The story is fairly good. I am kind of torn between the redundant idea of 'Being in the wrong place at the wrong time.' I mean, it just seems like maybe a new idea could have been come up with instead of him just being unlucky. But that entire theme was what made the first film so great and it does re-add some humor to this film which I like. There is one thing that upsets me about the story though. Colonel Stuart leads a group of ex-soldiers to take over Washington D.C. airport in order to rescue a captured drug lord who is being flown in to the airport. Yet this is all they apparently want! They want no money and as McClane said in the most recent one, 'It is always about the money.' So why do they just want the drug-lord? This 'inconsistency' really influences my disliking of the story. It may not seem like that big a deal but it kind of bugs me. There is a good twist in this movie that I like! I forgot all about it until I watched it again recently and it still surprised me when it jogged my memory. I really think the ending may be the best ending of all the movies! Just the way Willis plays off the ending is superb! The film has some newer, bigger, and more intense scenes in it. There is more that can be done at a huge airport I think than in a skyscraper so the movie is open to new possibilities. There are still plenty of varied and intense killings of terrorists by McClane so you will never know what to expect which is great.If you are a 'Die Hard' Die Hard fan, this a good movie for you. If you are a simple movie fan, this may not be a great movie for you. It is an excellent entertainment film with plenty of action and violence but the story seems inconsistent! It should be seen just because it is a Die Hard movie and as my friend says about Die Hard, 'If you don't like it, you don't have balls!'",8,0,2,12 July 2007
Batman Begins," Best Superhero Film Ever, NUFF SAID
","Being a huge fan of Burton's original Batman films, I realized I would have to go into this film a bit differently than I would watching Batman or Batman Returns. I have watched this film almost eight times since it was originally released and I think I enjoy it the same each time I watch it again. Christopher Nolan has done something absolutely wonderful with this film and I have yet to find anything really wrong with it.The story is absolutely terrific. David Goyer did a terrific job with the story. Christian Bale, for me, is the best Batman yet. It has alway been for me that Batman and Bruce Wayne are two different individuals and this movie makes that more distinct than any other batman film and Bale does the best job doing it. I absolutely love in this film the relationship Batman has with his allies. I always felt Burton's Batman films lacked the important relationship between Batman and James Gordon. Gary Oldman is the perfect Gordon and both characters develop an important relationship with each other that I feel was non-existent in the original batman films. Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworthy) and Morgan Freeman (Lucious Fox) also soar as important figures to Batman. Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard is pretty good. I think Scarecrow's character (played by Cilian Murphy) is not as good as it could be, but that is just one small and minor problem that offends me. The setting is wonderful. I love the depiction of Gotham City as a dirty, miserable, and slum infested city. The portrayal of 'the narrows' is terrific and although I loved Burton's portrayal of a Gothic and dark Gotham City that expanded the viewers imagination, the dark Gotham City in Batman Begins is better. It was great to see a taste of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One added to this film with the corruption that lies within the city among the mob and the powerful figure heads. The corruption of Gotham City is an important focal point that is addressed beautifully in this film. I absolutely love the music and the fight scenes are beautifully choreographed.One simple word can describe this movie, Wonderful! An absolute joy to watch and, in my opinion, the best take on Batman. This film is absolutely terrific and I recommend it highly. It truly is a masterpiece. I loved the Tim Burton Batman Movies, but Nolan has taken a step-up from those films!",10,2,2,16 June 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Thank you, Brett Ratner!
","I was very nervous going to see this film. I was a huge fan of the Bryan Singer X-men films and I was uncertain how Ratner would do with the third installment. He ended up creating a great film that may not be as good as Singer's two movies but nonetheless, it is still a great film.Acting is top notch in this film, as it has been through all the movies. The cast in the previous films all shine. Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, and even Halle Berry. The most notable role is filled by Famke Janssen who brings out her best performance yet. She really has a lot of intensity with her character in this film and it is a joy to watch her on screen. There are some notable additions as well to the film. Vinnie Jones does surprisingly well as a humorous and 'tough-as-nails' style Juggernaut and Kelsey Grammar portrays a terrific Beast. I was skeptical of him but he proved me wrong. All in all, the cast of this film is top notch.The cast may be good, but I feel there are some problems with the characters themselves. One is Cyclops. He is portrayed as such a wimp in this film and it sickens me. The one major line he has is, 'Some of us don't heal as fast as you Wolverine.' I mean, what a wimp! He is suppose to be one of the true leaders of this team and he gets swept aside in this movie like nothing. I was really disappointed with him. Another character is Angel. I am not really disappointed with his character but I think he is underused in this film. Ben Foster does a terrific job playing that character and he should have been used more. I love how they started the movie off with him though.There are so many great things about this film. We finally see Colossus in action. We see the true power and capabilities of Iceman. The true leadership qualities of the character Storm. And of course, the major role that Pyro serves as a villain and his powers. There may be many good things coming from a lot of characters, but it seems like the film tries to fit in too many new characters. We get no real back-stories or history of these characters. We are simply introduced to them and watch them in the film. We learn nothing really about them and that is a problem I have with the film and it is difficult to do with so many characters. The movie should have been longer. It was only 100 or so minutes. It could have been over a good 2 hours and then the time could have been taken to learn more about these characters.The story of the film is very good. Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn wrote a great story although I think they may have been trying a bit too hard in this film. It seems like they may have been trying to create a pure entertainment or pure comic style X-men film which does not really work for me. Although I love the concept behind the 'Mutant Cure' and the entire storyline. The action in this film is top notch. As a pure entertainment film, it gets 10 stars. The special effects are amazing, the fight scenes are terrific, and there is some funny humor in the movie as well.X-men 3 puts a good close to the movie franchise. I just hope the series does not go down the toilet after this film like so many other franchises. X-men 3 is a true X-men film that fits the style created by Bryan Singer in the first 2 films.",8,0,2,26 July 2007
Ghostbusters," The Ghostbusters are the best!!!!!!!
","I have loved this film for as long as I can remember and it is an absolute joy to watch. It is humorous, action-packed, and thrilling. The movie itself has some of the funniest actors alive in it and they all perform well. And the movie is based around a concept which can interest millions. It is no wonder this film is a cult classic.The film is directed by Ivan Reitman, the same genius behind films like Stripes and Meatballs. The film is written by both Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis, who both star in it. Ghostbusters is about a group of scientists who form a profession about hunting, tracking, and trapping ghosts! Exactly what the title insists! The story is terrific! Full of so many laughs, I get a kick out of the movie every time I watch it again and again. Some things are absolutely absurd but they are funny and that is the entire point.The acting is top notch among the three main Ghostbusters. Bill Murray, one of the funniest men alive, delivers one of his funniest performances. His serious, stylish, and absurdly-uptight attitude in this movie is funny as heck. Dan Akroyd is funny as well! Harold Ramis is hilarious! He is so serious with his job. He treats everything he does with such precise attention and importance. Like when the girl asks him what hobbies he has. Just the way he gives his response is hilarious. His character is great. These three actors have such good attitudes that their performances in this film came out top notch. Aside from the three ghostbusters, Rick Moranis gives a funny performance as well. His character is ridiculously funny as a dorky and stupid little guy! The comedy of these 4 actors make this film as good as it is! The special effects in this movie are very good! Everything from the blast packs to the ghosts to the stage set-ups. I love the Ghostbuster car! It is great! And the theme song is amazing! I get dance fever whenever I start to hear it!Bill Murray said, 'We came, we saw, we kicked it's ass!' That is exactly what Ghostbusters did to movie-goers everywhere. Everyone loves this movie and there is no question why. If you have yet to see this movie, stop reading and go rent it NOW! No disappointments. I guarantee it.",9,0,0,30 June 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Most Disappointing Comic Book Film Ever
","This film had so much potential. In my opinion, it could have been one of the best comic book films of all time. You have one of the greatest Super-hero groups, The Fantastic Four. One of the coolest comic book characters, The Silver Surfer. And most people know what the Silver Surfer is a precursor to, (Spoiler Avoiders: Turn Back Now!). Yes, Galactus is in this film and I am just speechless with his character. This movie could have been so much better.First, the acting. Ioan Gruffud does yet again nothing as Mr. Fantastic. His performance is mediocre and the same with Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom and Jessica Alba as Susan Storm. Their performances did not change any from the first one. Chris Evans does a fairly good job in this film as a reckless and arrogant Johnny Storm. I liked the evolution of his character in this film from the last one! He is learning to become more responsible and we are seeing that character transition but he still has some reckless and self-impressive characteristics! Good story with Johnny Storm! Michael Chiklis is still good as the Thing but I feel his character is underused in the film.Laurence Fishburne is the highlight of the film! He is a perfect voice for the Silver Surfer! The Silver Surfer character is amazing. An absolute thrill to watch! His qualities, characteristics, and powers are stunning! I love watching him fight! His character is very good although I do not think we get enough back story of him and his powers. Excellent portrayal of the Silver Surfer though.The story is OK, the suspense of the film really got me on the edge. But the movie disappoints in that it builds more and more to a climatic point that is just completely mediocre. First, the surfer comes and starts making unknown phenomena occurring. Than, he tells Dr. Doom all he knows is at an end. Than, he tells Susan he has no choice and what is going to happen can't be stopped. Than, he tells Susan once he is captured that Galactus is coming. Than, we meet Frankie Rye. In the comics, she is a character who later sacrificed herself to become a herald to Galactus. Notice, The movie is building up more and more with little details/quotes hinting on some big event coming up with Galactus. Than, we see what looks like a silhouette of Galactus' helmet on Saturn (I think). And it comes down to the Surfer confronting Galactus, which is only what seems like a black hole and the surfer blows them both up!!! Thats it! No big Surfer/F.F. vs. Galactus showdown; The surfer draws up his power and blows up Galactus. That is not much of a climatic finish. After watching the trailers and seeing the Surfer, I was expecting some big battles with him and the F.F. but there was none except the chase scene with The Surfer and the Torch. The film set it up for some big pinnacle and never reached it.Galactus' character is terrible. He is apparently a black-hole! That is it. He is no living being or elemental force of the cosmos! And it seems as if the Surfer is the source of his own power! His power comes from his board and we learn nothing about how he acquired his powers! It can only be assumed that The Surfer had his own powers and his silvery nature is his own physical characteristic. Not that Galactus gave him his powers. There seem to be too many questions unresolved about the Surfers powers, how he got them, and the powers of Galactus.One simple word can describe this film, disappointing! I was more excited for this film than Spider-man 3 and I had high expectations for it that were not meant. Just a disappointing and poor movie!",5,2,5,1 July 2007
Transformers," Transformers: Perhaps more than meets the eye?
","I grew up a huge fan of the Transformer TV series, the original one in the 80's. I have some of the episodes on cassette and I want to buy the entire series on DVD. That is how much I like the show and it was the best cartoon series of all time in my opinion. The movie Transformers, in my opinion, would make the cartoon proud. It is an absolutely stunning and brilliantly-made film.The special effects of this film are great. The designs and interpretations of the Transformers are incredible, far beyond what I was expecting. The fight scenes are even better! Just imagine two 100-foot tall transformers going at one another! And the Transformer vs. Transformer battles are not just great, but the Transformer vs. Human battles are good too! The effects are so real as well! Not for a second did I think the effects were overdone or ridiculously fake. The special effects of this film are beyond belief and what they do to the Transformer characters. Although most of the Transformers lost their original exoskeleton designs for the movies, I was not displeased with their new exoskeleton designs.Acting is pretty solid in this film. Shia Lebeouf, Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and even Bernie Mac deliver good performances. The thing I like about the movie is that it takes a serious approach to the Transformers. But it still keeps a lot of humor in the movie. And it is not even stupid humor, it is good, solid, funny humor. A lot of it will either come from Shia Lebeouf, Bernie Mac, or the Transformers which I really like.I absolutely loved the music in the film. I felt like I was watching Batman Begins and that was fantastic. The music was terrific, I might even buy the soundtrack. The sound was great as well, just hearing the Transformers transform was terrific. The story is fantastic as well. Some of the most crucial Transformers and Decepticons are put into the movie. The story builds up more and more as it goes. I kept getting more on edge as the movie went on and I like that in a film. I disliked how they handled the story with Sam and his 'girlfriend' Mikaela. It seemed stupid and unnecessary. Other than that, the story is easy to follow and easy to get drawn into.Finally, the Transformers themselves. I will admit, I was worried about there not being enough original and recognizable Transformers in the film but I was wrong. I do wish they had more with the Transformers in the movie though. The movie seemed to focused on the humans and not enough on the title characters. Other than that, the characters are great. They bring in 5 of the biggest characters as the core group of the Autobots which was wonderful to see. Peter Cullen voices Optimus Prime and all I can say is I think we need to give the guy an award. Lets get him an Oscar nomination, Please. Because whenever I hear him talk, my heart just starts racing. Megatron is voiced wonderfully by Hugo Weaving. You can barely tell it is Weaving because his voice is covered by a metallic voice-over which sounds terrific. I admit, I had a hard time deciphering Bumblebee. Although there is a reason for it, I had a hard time hearing him. I disliked Starscream in the movie. He looked really awkward (like a gorilla) and I was disappointed with his character. I do not want to be a spoiler, so I won't tell you any more Transformers although I would absolutely love to discuss them. One small thing, I wish Cullen would have done the voice of another Transformer in the movie. That is all I am saying!!!!!!!Transformers is more than meets the eye. I was expecting a mediocre movie and I got a terrific movie. One of the best films I have seen this year. And if you think Peter Cullen should get an Oscar nod for his performance as Optimus Prime, make a comment on my 'comment'. Maybe than we can convince the Academy Awards!",9,3,5,7 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Wow!
","The only spoilers here are regarding the Harvey Dent character. I wrote a review for Batman Begins a while back where I claimed it as being the Greatest Comic Book Film ever made and I was so cocky I decided to add NUFF SAID to that title. But that can no longer be true. The Dark Knight is not only the greatest Comic book Film to date, it is one of the greatest Cinematic Masterpieces of all time. In my honest opinion, it is the 4th greatest film ever made aside from; The Godfather, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, and The Empire Strikes Back.Lets start with the simpler things. Music is phenomenal. Zimmer and Newton Howard are able to capture the best music for each scene and each character. I absolutely love the soundtrack. Cinematography is outstanding. Filming is terrific. Direction by Christopher Nolan is terrific. He truly has a talent for creating a feel and style for a film and he does it better then ever in this film. I love dark films and this is best one ever. NUFF SAID! The story is out of this world extraordinary. One of the best stories ever written for a movie. The story itself is so good in that it is mostly about developing characters. The Nolans and Goyer are able to capture certain qualities of each character and develop them perfectly in the story. And NO major character is left aside. And by NO characters, I mean NO characters. For every major character in the film, each has certain characteristics that are perfectly utilized and most characters undergo perfect transformations or develop certain traits that are perfectly utilized in the story. They perfectly create the Joker and Two-Face characters. Non-stop action with exhilarating and electrifying scenes keep the viewer engulfed in the film. And the ending, oh my god, what an ending. The basic ideas represented in the ending are phenomenal. This film is perfect.What can be said about the casting except phenomenal. Absolutely Phenomenal. I don't want to bother with the details but I find that two actors are worthy of recognition. Firstly, Aaron Eckhart. He was a phenomenal Harvey Dent. He had a lot of intensity on screen and you can tell he was committed to the character which is extremely important in that he plays a character who is very committed. But his true talents came with Two-Face. He portrayed the anger and vengeful duel side of Harvey Dent perfectly. He made the transformation from honest, hard-working protector to insane, vengeful villain exceptionally well. Well done, Mr. Eckhart. Should I even bother by saying who the other great actor is? Of course, it is Heath Ledger. Ledger is sadistic, psychopathic, scary, and absolutely, positively, 100% genuine insane. Ledger does not just outperform Nicholson. He makes Nicholson's character appear like a child's version. Ledgers voice, actions, movements; they all make him appear so much more dangerous then Nicholson ever could. He has some humor like Nicholson, but he has the scary effect. And we must remember, the joker is not just a comedian with a bad temper who commits silly crimes. He is an ill-fated individual with no remorse who cares nothing for the world around him and has a personality that could make a psychiatrist kill themselves. And Ledger not only captures that on screen, he completely emerges himself into that. Mr. Ledger, I congratulate you on one of the greatest performances by an actor in movie history.Two-Face and the Joker are created perfectly for this film. Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones could not even match Ledger alone. Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart along with the Nolan's character development, make them the best villains in Comic Book Movies yet. And thanks for keeping Two-Face's duality. Unlike in Batman Forever where that characteristic is completely ignored.'Why so Serious?' This film is one of the greatest films ever made. Seriously!!! This film is better then all other batmans put together. (To think, my friends girlfriend said this was not as good as Batman Forever.) This is a cinematic masterpiece. 2008 Oscars, here comes The Dark Knight. I can feel a Best Film nomination and Best Supporting Actor nomination for the man in the make-up.",10,5,11,27 July 2008
The Departed," Academy Award Winner of Best Picture for a reason
","When I went to see The Departed, I was left with a feeling I very rarely have after watching a movie. I usually either feel satisfaction or disappointment, but The Departed left me craving. I wanted more! I did not want the film to be over! There is never a dull moment in this film! I really do not care if some people feel it is a copy-cat film of the Chinease movie 'Internal Affairs'. I absolutely love this movie and I am glad so many people enjoy it as much as I do.Martin Scorsese is able to somehow grab a certain story from real life and just turn it into an unbelievably good movie. He does that here. He is able to take the terms and lifestyles used in an original historical Boston setting and incorporate them into this film. The story itself is terrific. It focuses on the part of two 'undercover' agents working against each other! One is a police officer inside a Boston mob organization and one is a member of that organization inside the police force. The entire story sets up nicely and builds up to a huge climatic point where to put it simply, 'the $hit hits the fan!' The filming of this movie is fantastic! Every scene looks perfect! There is plenty of action in this film and a lot of humor. There is never a point of boredom or uneasiness! The movie flows so perfectly that you can follow it easily! If I were to put this film into a genre, it would be a mixture of a comedy/action/drama/suspense/thriller.The casting in this movie is self-explanatory. Just look at the names; DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Winstone, M. Sheen, and Baldwin. Everyone plays their hearts out! DiCaprio and Damon are good in their two lead roles. Nicholson was up for an Oscar Nomination for his role which is fantastic! He plays the stylish and dangerous mob boss Frank Costello. Alec Baldwin is pretty darn funny, he plays the head of a special investigation unit of the police department! But the best actor in this film is without a doubt, Mark Wahlberg. He got an academy award nomination for best supporting actor for his character, Dignam! He stole every scene he was in! He was extremely funny and serious at the same time. A terrific performance on his part. All the actors in this film feed off of one another brilliantly. You can pick out the intensity they have when they are shooting this film. It is phenomenal! And although the actors do a great job in their roles, the characters created for them are perfect! Every character created for this film has an important part and they all do something memorable for this film. Everything about the actors and the characters in this film rocked! I love Martin Scorsese and I truly believe, in my own opinion, this is his best film. I know it is my favorite but I think it may also be his best. This film has everything a good movie needs! Yes, you can expect violence and a lot of vulgar language, but it is worth it! The vulgarity in my opinion only adds to the intensity of the film. I truly believe everyone should see this movie. It may seem long at 2 and half hours but it is worth it. If you (the previewer) does watch this film, I hope you gain the same respect for it I have. Because 30 years from now, people will still remember this movie and those people will remember how fantastic it was.",10,2,4,21 June 2007
Die Hard," Influenced me as a child
","Die Hard had a significant impact on me as a child. I would go to school in the fourth grade talking about how I wanted to hunt terrorists and smoke cigarettes just like John McClane. That is influence, right there! This film definitely takes the title of, 'Best Action Film of All Time!'John McTiernan has created a pop culture icon with Die Hard. Everyone knows the film and for good reasons. As Homer Simpson once wrote...'Dear Die Hard, you rock! Especially when you were on the roof.' Die Hard is all about entertainment and it provides just that. Violence, humor, action, vulgarity; everything that a good man needs in a movie. There are so many things in this film that make it great! The roof sequence where McClane fights terrorists while being shot at by a helicopter. McClane's unique and varied different killings of the terrorists. And of course, the unforgettable quote, 'Yi-pi-ki-ya (apologizes for miss spellings), Mother F#C*ER!' Die Hard has one goal, entertain! And there is never a moment of boredom in this film.Although it succeeds in entertainment, acting is terrific in this movie. On the part of three main actors. First, is of course, Bruce Willis as John McClane. Second, is Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber. Rickman does such a good job as an uptight, stylish, and sophisticated Gruber who is also a sick and demented individual. The character is played perfectly. Third is Alexander Godunov as Karl. Maybe my favorite character in the film, Karl is the muscle man. Gruber's #1 guy! And after McClane kills his brother, Karl takes it personal. He is an incredibly dangerous and psychotic individual and I love him for it. These three actors are what make the film entertaining aside from the action.Die Hard is the best action film of all time! Terminator, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry, Predator all need to move aside. This film has everything an action movie needs. As my friend always said about this film, 'If you don't like it, you don't have balls!'",10,4,5,22 June 2007
Jaws," Best Horror Film of all time
","Jaws is the best horror film of all time! It is about something that many people can relate to and can actually fear. One of Nature's most feared animals is the Shark and to create a horror film around that animal, you could guess what the response should be like. It gave viewers something to actually be scared about and that was going swimming. It had the same effect on me when I watched this movie when I was 10. I could not go swimming and although I overcame it and have a passionate love of studying sharks, I still get scared every time I start swimming in deep water (even in a lake or pond). This film horrified viewers and it is no wonder why!The acting in this movie is superb. Roy Schneider portrays a devoted and frightened cop! He fears for the peoples safety when a rogue shark starts attacking and there is nothing he can do to convince the town's mayor to call off people from swimming. Richard Dreyfuss plays a very humorous scientist who is a shark expert. Robert Shaw is absolutely fantastic. He plays his character perfectly! I feel, he has some of the best intensity of any actor when he is playing his character in this movie. Put the three together and you have a great trio that is actually quite funny.Steven Spielberg does so many things to make this go right! One, is the shark. With each attack, you begin to see more and more of the shark. Not yet being exposed to the true size or shape of the shark until the right time has come. The suspense just builds up more and more which really keeps the viewer on edge! And the third attack on the beach is filmed wonderfully! One of my favorite parts. You see the lone girl screaming 'SHARK! There's a Shark in the pool!' and you see a lone dorsal fin out in the water. Than it cuts back to Roy Schneider beginning to run and than the good part, where Spielberg shows the size of this shark perfectly without us even seeing most of it. We see the dorsal and tip of the caudal fin slowly start to sink behind Schneider's son sitting on the beach. And the spread between that thing is incredible. When I saw that scene, my jaw was on the floor and I was crapping my pants! Spielberg just does many small things like that to make the movie that much better.And than Spielberg's and the writers usage of quotes. Lines like, 'You are gonna need a bigger boat!' never cease to fascinate me! The suspense, the action, the entertainment, the horror, the intensity, and the humor of this film are top notch. This film is not rivaled when it comes to horror movies. It tops the list and 32 years later, this film is still one of the best. It would absolutely stun me if the person reading this comment had not seen the film. You should go buy it now! Don't rent it, buy it! You will watch it again and again! And keep it someday to show to your kids because it will still be a horror then!",10,1,3,1 July 2007
Iron Man," One of Marvel's Best to Date
","Iron man is a great start to this years movie season. It is just a sweet action packed adventure. The great colleague of trailers leading up to the movie was worth the eight bucks for a ticket as well. This is one of the best comic book films to date. I would go as far as saying this is Marvel's best film alongside X-men 2.Robert Downey Jr. portrays the playboy and illustrious Tony Stark perfectly. His mannerisms and attitude are everything I could hope from the character. His casual and laid-back attitude mixed with a serious and devoted approach to his work is an excellent portrayal of the Stark character. Downey is phenomenal in what I would call his best performance and most memorable to date. His character may have a bit too much cockiness for my pleasing though. The rest of the cast including Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges as the villain Obadiah Stone all deliver good performances Jeff Bridges character can seem relatively dull at times but his character definitely improves as the movie goes on. Noteworthy is Downey, Phenomenal acting on his part and he makes it appear as if he was born to play Tony Stark.The conceptual designs of Iron man are outstanding. I love seeing the evolution of the armor going from an original grey giant to a perfectly designed red-blue suit. The effects are terrific and watching the evolution of the costume and Stark's designing of it is a great addition to the film. The Iron Monger is a great robotic villain for Iron man. I was just expecting him to use Tony's original costume but to see a new design made it much better. The special effects are terrific.The story is outstanding. A couple of new concepts are added to the story and help make it interesting. It is easy to follow and easy to dive into. I am so glad that the biggest concept of the Stark character was handled so well in this film. The idea that Stark feels at fault for all the harm he has created with his weapons. This ultimately leads him to designing the suit and become a protector. And even better, we see the struggles and challenges he must overcome. The stress and hardships he feels after his incident overseas.This is it! Indiana Jones, The Hulk, Hellboy, Wanted, and EVEN The Dark Knight have a lot to live up to. This is going to be one of the best films of the summer. I am not just saying that from the perspective of a fan boy, but also as a movie goer. This is one of the best comic adaptations to date that has helped modernize a character and help relate him to a modern day world. Fantastic film. Bravo Jon Favreau.P.S. Watch the movie all the way through. Don't leave until after the credits. You do not want to miss the scene afterwards. I literally jumped over the seats and down into the aisle way once I saw it. I bruised up my arms and legs. NO JOKE! This extra scene is everything you could hope for.",10,3,6,3 May 2008
The Deer Hunter," The Best Film Ever made about War
","Most of you after reading my title are already going to be upset. I do consider this to be the best film ever made about war. I do not look at this film being about the Vietnam War. I look at this film being about war (Period).I think this film is as excellent as it is for one good reason, showing the effects of war. True, we see the films where men are shaped by war, what events make them who they are, and how the events of war transform them. It is mainly about what the war has done to them. The Deer Hunter takes a bigger step back from that and shows the entire character transformation. It does not just show the transformation of a soldier, but also the transformation as a civilian. You spend a good 40 minutes in the Deer Hunter getting to know the main characters and getting a feel for their personalities. The first 40 minutes is about character development and almost getting an attachment to those characters. This makes their transformation more effective for the viewer and they almost feel for the character and what they are going through. Than those characters get thrown into war and you see the events that change them. The things they had to experience as a soldier. And than, most importantly, we see the changes in their characters after the war. And we do not just see the changes in the soldiers, we see the changes that their friends and lovers undergo as a result of the war. We are not just looking at one soldier, we are looking at a network of friends and how they are changed due to the war. Even those who did not go to war are still effected. And the fact all the characters are from a small town makes it that much more powerful. The Deer Hunter is a powerful film about how war effects everybody, not just the soldiers involved in it.The cast is terrific! Robert De Niro, John Cazale, John Savage, Meryll Streep, and Christopher Walken. Need I say more. Christopher Walken won an Oscar for best supporting actor in this film. The script is beautifully written and the movie is filmed perfectly. I can find nothing wrong with anything about this movie. I mean, it did win 5 Oscars in 1978 including Best Picture and Best Director for Michael Cimino.This movie is emotionally powerful. I can not say this film is accurate about war, I can only give my opinion and take from the film what I can. I am an 18-year old teen who has an almost complete control over his emotions. This film brought me the closest to tears I have ever been by a movie. It is an absolute masterpiece. This is one of the greatest films ever made. Take the time to watch this film, it is a classic that hits you the hardest emotionally.",10,63,112,18 June 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Lacks the feel of a 'Die Hard' movie
","Live Free or Die Hard is a good film but seems different from the original three movies. It lacks in what made the first one great and the other two good! I was impressed with solid acting and a very interesting story! It has intensity but not as much as the other three Die Hards in my opinion.Len Wiseman directs this fourth installment. The film is rated PG-13 and not R. That already told me it would not be as good as the other ones. Violence and vulgarity are toned down way low (very disappointed). Violence especially, there is not as many cool, intense, and dramatic killings in this film that the originals had. The film brings back some of the original Die Hard music which really got me excited! I loved the original film's music and too hear them return to that got me excited, not to forget where the film has come from. The action sequences are bigger and better. One with a jet, That is pretty crazy. I dislike the way the film was shot! At times, the camera seems to be all over the place and changing shots way too often! Especially when it is completely unnecessary! The story is both good and interesting! An interesting concept to put behind a Die Hard film. I liked it. And we spend absolutely no time with McClane's past which is good! Focus on the future story! No need to try and remind the viewer of McClane's past, we focus on his current situation which I like. Bruce Willis, as usual, fulfills his role of John McClane. Ten years can not change the way he portrays that character. He is as great as ever! His character is just as funny and serious as the originals. Timothy Olyphant does a good job as the villain, Thomas Gabriel. He is no Hans Gruber, but he does come off as being a dangerous threat! Maybe not to McClane, but to the nation! Justing Long does good as his computer-hacker character. I really do not like him and did not approve of him being in the movie but he did a good job. He did not give me something to criticize him for. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lucy McClane and she does a great job. Her character is played just like her father and she does a good job of doing it. She even has her fathers mentality (beyond what you may think of McClane being just a cop). Especially when she is with Thomas Gabriel. Wonderful casting and wonderful characters.Overall, it is a good film! I do consider it high enough caliber to be a Die Hard movie but it feels different than the other ones. The acting and story is good but I think it lacks in intensity, language, and violence. People do not watch Die Hard for a purpose or meaning. They watch to be entertained! And I feel the entertainment of this 'Die Hard' movie was not as good as it could have been! A very good movie though!",8,1,4,28 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," Brilliant Storytelling and Brilliant Acting
","Brilliant Storytelling and Brilliant Acting is what make this the Best X-men Film. Bryan Singer has done an incredible job with the X-men series and after this sequel, it is no wonder why. This is a brilliant film with little flaws, terrific acting, and a wonderful storyline. This is one of the best comic book movies to date.Not only do the excellent actors in Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, and Rebecca Romijn return as great characters but we see a whole new line of excellent characters and actors. One of which is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler. His character is so amazing in this film and Cumming does a beautiful job of bringing it out. His character is so likable and the entire part of the story focusing around him: his back-story, his faith, and the effect he has on Storm is wonderful. Speaking of Storm, Halle Berry plays a strong role in this film as Storm. I disliked her in the first film but she does better in this one. We finally begin to see her emerge as a leader and as a dynamic force to this X-men unit. Brian Cox delivers an incredible performance in this film as William Stryker. He captures his characters mental instability perfectly on screen. And a big compliment goes out to Aaron Stanford. He is a perfect actor for the character Pyro. He has a certain anger and 'deadliness' characteristic to his appearance that makes him well suited for the part.I would also like to add that I think this film is Mystique at her best. Rebecca Romijn takes complete control of her character in this film and holds little to nothing back. Her character has evolved into an even more evil, dangerous, and wicked character from the first film. Her performance in this film is extremely notable.There are some small problems I have with the characters. I do dislike Icemans character in this film. He seems to much like a wimp and do-what-your-told character. Cyclops seems like he is gone for way to long in the movie. He may appear in like the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes. This film was the first in his descent as a critical character.I like this film because it is a teaser to the young mutants powers. We begin to see just some of the capabilities Iceman has. Another teaser, seeing Colossus for the first time transform. And of course, the ultimate power that Pyro possesses and not only how well he can handle it, but also how dangerous he truly is with it. I would have liked to see more with these characters powers but I understand they are developing and these 'glimpses' are just a teaser to show what they are developing into and what they will be capable of in future films.What makes this movie great is the story. There is little to no flaws with this movie and it is so easy to get sucked into the story. It is very easy to follow yet has a deep and powerful meaning to it. So many concepts are touched on in the movie (Wolverines past, Developing more powerful side of Jean Grey (Phoenix!)) with little to no inconsistencies affecting the major storyline. This is one of the best stories, I believe, ever written for a film and I give a tip of the hat to the list of writers and screenplay writers.The movie is amazing in that so much happens but you do not feel like anything was wasted in the end. You feel like every pivotal character was touched on enough, no big character got left out of anything, and you are left with a feeling of satisfaction. This is a truly wonderful film.",10,1,2,28 July 2007
300," 'Madness..............This is Genius!'
","300 has very few words to describe it. It is a phenomenal film! When I saw this movie in the theater, it absolutely blew me away! It definitely deserves to be on the Top 250 list.Zach Snyder brings Frank Miller's Graphic Novel 300 to life in this film. The film focuses on the 300 Spartans who fought off the Persian armies in the memorable Battle of Thermopyle. The vast superior Spartans where believed to have faced some million Persian soldiers. The superior fighting skills of the Spartans are beautifully portrayed in this film. The fight sequences are great, one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The film is dismal and dark, giving it a scary/saddening characteristic. The effects are stunning, jaw-dropping, eye-bulging, and so forth! This is what I call eye candy! The sound and music is perfect. Action is a plenty in this film. Never dull, never boring, and edge of your seat excitement. The story is well-written. Not just the story around the Battle of Thermopyle but also around the success of the Spartan soldier and the Spartan Empire. The story focusing on the wolf and the hunt and the training of a soldier is brilliant. To actually understand how and why these Spartan soldiers were as powerful as they were. A terrific story!Gerard Butler portrays King Leonidas. He does an incredible job with this character. The intensity and enthusiasm of him is incredible. He portrays the anger, intensity, and determination of his character perfectly. I think he could get an Oscar nomination for his performance. An absolutely stunning acting job by him, one of the best performances I have ever seen. David Wenham does a good job as well with his character Dilios. Dilios is one of Leonidas' top commanders and his character is excellent. Although I heavily emphasize these two actors performances, the rest of the cast does a great job as well.I like the interpretation of Xerxes (the Persian Leader) in this film. He is a disgusting, vulgar, repulsive, and disturbing individual. A beautiful portrayal of his character. I absolutely hated him and I think that may have been the goal of Zach Snyder. To create a villainous character that the viewers could hate and it is done perfectly here.If you have not seen 300 in theaters, go find one NOW! This is what I call a 'Theater Experience'. It is a must see, either in or out of the theater. A terrific film and absolutely stunning visually!",10,1,3,28 June 2007
Fantastic Four," A 'Fantastic' Disappointment
","Fantastic Four is a big disappointment. It had the possibility to create a fantastic movie series and it did not do it. The film has poor acting, directing, and the story is not very good! Overall, a poor film that should have been done better! The acting is poor in this film. Jessica Alba is no Susan Storm and she does a bad job portraying her. The film probably just wanted somebody of physical attractiveness in this film. Same with Ioan Gruffud. At times he does well, playing an intelligent and determined Reed Richards (ecspecially in the beginning), but he does only mediocre at best. A disappointment for him because I was expecting better. Chris Evans is good as a cocky and arrogant Johnny Storm but he does nothing special. Michael Chiklis is the bright point as the Thing/Ben Grimm. He does a good job of portraying the anger, dismalness, and suffering of the Thing. Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom! I will be flat out honest, he has ruined this character. McMahon has no where the intensity to portray this character. After watching him on screen, I think he may not even want to be there playing the character because he acts so sub-par. He lacks the anger, determination, and evil genius of the Doctor Doom character. He does a very bad job! One of the most disappointing interpretations of a character ever.The story in this film is pretty bad. Mark Frost does little to nothing in creating a good or interesting story for that matter. I could never get into the film. One bright point of this film is the portrayal of the Thing. Chiklis and the story do a good job of showing the pain and suffering of the Thing in his character. Also note-worthy is the Johnny Storm character. He is arrogant and cocky which is a surprisingly good portrayal of the character. I hate the Dr. Doom character. McMahon can't be fully to blame but the writers can as well for creating this character. He has his greediness but he seems as if he is lacking in determination and evil capabilities. And it seems as if the writers try to make up for that in the movie by giving him some sort of unlimited/cosmic/god-like powers which only make the character worst. What makes Doom dangerous is his character, not his powers.Special effects are pretty bad! I mean, I imagine it must be hard to create a Thing costume but this one is just so fake. And some of the special effects seem way overdone including the final showdown between the 4 and Doom. Overall, a big disappointment. The Fantastic Four is an excellent comic book group and they deserved better than this. Mostly bad acting and bad character portrayal is what ruin this movie. If you are a Fantastic Four fan, you might want to avoid it so you don't lose respect for your characters. I would give this film an upper level rating of 4 stars, but none the less it is still 4 stars.",4,0,2,30 June 2007
