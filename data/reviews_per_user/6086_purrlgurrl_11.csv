10 Cloverfield Lane," What are people throwing shade on this movie?
","Pluses: 1. Great cast. Really good chemistry among them. Terrific performances from all. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gets better with every film she makes. 2. Story keeps you guessing until the end. 3. There are references in it to some popular films in the genre (that are likely film maker favorites) from the past 30 years or so. 4. Director shows great promise while still early in his career. 4. Story more important than special effects or pointless action sequences (always a plus for me). 5. Sound effects, usually unappreciated in non-action films, well used to add to the intensity of the drama.Minuses: 1. We've probably all seen John Goodman play a similar character before. 2. There's a possible murder that took place prior to the film, a plot device never resolved.Since the film has the word 'Cloverfield' in the title, a lot of dim light bulbs thought this was a prequel or sequel to the other film and bad mouthed it because it isn't. Using Cloverfield in the title was likely just another reference to a favorite film.Some people didn't understand the ending. Huh? They must have fallen asleep during the rest of the movie (when they realized it wasn't Cloverfield 2) or this generation is dumber than I fear it might be. The actions of Winstead's character at the end of the film make perfect sense in light of a monologue she delivered earlier, which apparently was ignored by those whining about the ending.Don't listen to the naysayers. It isn't high art, but it's an entertaining film that will hold your attention to the end.",8,11,19,28 July 2016
Interstellar," A rare gem of a film . . .
","A grand adventure into both the unknown and the human heart. Who expects to be moved to tears by a science fiction film? Well, I was deeply, and left the the theater dabbing my eyes. Don't let that scare you away because this is science fiction for the mature and intelligent. It does what the very best science fiction always does, it provokes you to contemplate what it means to be human.I won't try to synopsize the plot because I can't do it justice. Just know that Ann Hathaway's character expresses the film's theme in a moving speech about love's transcendence of the dimensions of time and space.It's hard to single anyone out in a cast where everyone is at the top of their game, but McConaughey is the heart and soul of the film along with Mackenzie Foy as his young daughter Murph. Hathaway proves here again she has a talent deeper than many of her roles have allowed her to display.I read one film critic's description of the film as being a not quite as good version of Kubrick's 2001 for his generation. But, I don't believe that 2001 has held up well over time, in large part because Kubrick's vision was so cold and sterile. Whereas, the Nolans share a vision with genuine heart at its core, which I think makes it the stronger film.Check it out for yourself and see what you think.",10,8,17,16 November 2014
Bird Box," Meh.
","Highly derivative. In other words, M. Night Shyamalan and John Krasinski should sue for plagiarism. It's a mashup of 'The Happening' and 'A Quiet Place'.A high profile cast wasted on a so-so story and a script full of holes. It wasn't all that suspenseful and you can see the major plot turns coming from a mile away.If you've got nothing better to do, go ahead and watch it. Just don't expect a lot.",5,1,4,24 December 2018
The Thing," A remake that far surpasses the original . . .
","I've seen Carpenter's version of 'The Thing' now over half a dozen times. Even so, there are scenes where I hide my eyes because they have the power to still scare the bejesus out of me. This is, IMO, one of the scariest scifi horror films ever made and John Carpenter's best work . . . ever. The suspense is heart pounding, the performances uniformly terrific, Carpenter's direction is flawless, and Rob Bottin's monster effects are timelessly terrifying and the star of the film. If you've never seen Carpenter's version of 'The Thing' and you're a fan of scifi or horror (or both), you MUST see this film.",10,1,2,28 April 2014
District 9," We've been here before . . .
","I think it was trying to be Children of Men. with aliens. My complaints are too much graphic violence and too long. The aliens aren't very biologically plausible, either, but it's only a movie.The plot's not really SciFi. It's more a comment on how humans treat large groups of refugees, minorities, and immigrants settled in their midst (I told you it was trying to be Children of Men). Similar ground (using aliens as a metaphor) was covered before, albeit differently, in Alien Nation. The story is set in South Africa, and the country's pre-Mandela history resonates throughout the film.The most interesting thing in the movie is its lead, Sharlto Copley, whom I suspect will be the next big international actor everyone wants for their upcoming production. He turns in a helluva fine performance as a dorky stooge in the beginning, but a true hero in the end. If this movie's a big hit, everyone will be chasing him.I don't want to be a plot spoiler so I won't elaborate on the story. Aliens or not, District 9 could be a refugee/minority detention camp anywhere on earth today.",5,21,40,18 August 2009
Revolutionary Road," Toto, we're not on the Titanic anymore
","In Titanic, Kate and Leo were the achingly romantic, star-crossed lovers who would meet again in eternity. In Revolutionary Road they show us what might have happened if the couple survived.It's late 1950s American suburbia and he's settled into a similar deadening job in sales, at the same company, as his father and she's an unhappy, stifled housewife who once dreamed of being an actress. Along the way, both have meaningless affairs to relieve their boredom. Attempting to save their marriage, she devices a desperate plan to escape their narrow, regimented 50s existence -- they'll sell everything, take their life savings and move the family (they have two kids) to Paris, where he can take time off to 'find himself' while she works as a secretary at NATO or UNESCO to support them.This dream is shattered by her unplanned pregnancy (termination is not an option for him) and his recent promotion at work. What happens then is the unraveling of a marriage and a life.This is not a movie for faint of heart. It's long, very slow-paced (a BBC production) and there's no light at the end of the tunnel for this pair. This is a far different couple from the lovers in Titanic. And, thank God for that because in this film both actors get the chance to demonstrate the true range of their talents, as well as again, the powerful chemistry they have together on screen.There are uniformly fine performances by the supporting cast, with Michael Shannon the standout (and Oscar nominee) as the emotionally disturbed son of friends, whose insanity grants him the freedom to be the sole voice of truth in this repressed suburban hell.",8,0,0,6 June 2009
Gone Girl," Read the book . . . disappointed
","The theme of the book is how we often hide our true selves and role play in the beginning of a relationship in order to attract and hold onto a partner. Then, when we can no longer maintain the facade, our real selves emerge and things can go bad. In this case, things don't just go bad, they go totally off the rails. This theme, which explains both main characters in the book, isn't emphasized as forcefully in the film.Fincher made the mistake of believing his audiences are comprised entirely of those who read the book. Those who haven't can get left behind, especially in the Amazing Amy subplot, which is not fleshed out. Rosamund Pike is the cast standout as Amy, the wife gone missing. Missi Pyle is a close second as a Nancy Grace-like cable news commentator who's seen only on TV screens in many scenes. Nevertheless, she steals every scene she's in. Ben Affleck is capable as the husband under suspicion in his wife's disappearance. But, it's awfully tough to buy Neil Patrick Harris in his role as a slightly creepy, obsessed former suitor. Being honest about how well I felt the book was brought to the screen, I can't give Gone Girl a high rating. Fincher did a creditable job, but this is not his best work.",5,5,12,4 November 2014
Elysium," Terrific action film; failed allegory
","Much like Children of Men, the real subject of this film is the diaspora of émigrés from third world countries around the world who are unwelcome in the first world countries spanning the North Atlantic and Europe they are penetrating. With his second major film, it's clear that political allegory (District 9's real subject is South Africa's apartheid) is the basis of Blomkamp's SciFi stories. Unlike District 9, this film stumbles in presenting its allegory coherently, therefore, some viewers during the screening I attended laughably seemed to think the story is all about Obamacare.Blomkamp is a South African émigré living in Canada, which has had universal health care for 50 years, one of the magnets drawing immigrants to it from less developed countries. Canada also has very strict immigration and naturalization policies (more so than the US), which some in Canada have begun to question. But the situation depicted in the film could just as well be Europe, which also has a recent tradition of universal health care and feels itself under siege by third world immigrants. Meanwhile, the US continues to struggle unsuccessfully with its own issue of undocumented immigrants. These are the underpinnings of the film's story line, set in LA probably as a bow to US financing and to lend credibility to its American leads.Nevertheless, I found it wildly entertaining and was on the edge of my seat. I was also pleased to see Sharlto Copley on screen again. He was simply terrific in District 9. I keep expecting him to become a big international star once he gets to play a contemporary man in an A-list film.",8,1,4,13 August 2013
The Witch," Not at all what was expected.
","This is more of a historical psychological thriller than a Hollywood blood and guts horror film.The film is a loving and accurate recreation of Puritan New England in the 1600s with everything from the language to the sets being authentic to the period. That in and of itself makes it fascinating to watch. Having lived in Virginia, where the Jamestown Settlement and the 1600s sometimes can seem like they happened the day before yesterday, I especially enjoyed the film. The location, in Ontario, reminded me of rural Virginia in winter, which made me quite homesick. So the film might have affected me more than some other audience members.The Witch is a fascinating glimpse into Christianity as practiced by 17th century Puritans. Satan and Evil are almost tangible presences in the woods and wilderness of the New World, while God is a distant, cold, and demanding being who must be constantly begged for forgiveness and mercy, since all human thoughts, words, and deeds seem to be gravely sinful and offensive to his eyes. A family of seven (parents, four children, and an infant) are exiled from their plantation community for not adhering to the accepted interpretation of scripture. They build a farm at a distance from the plantation near a frightening wood. The farm is failing (the family won't have food to last the winter). Meanwhile, the infant has been snatched from the oldest daughter while in her care at the edge of the wood. From this point on the family either descends into madness or is destroyed by Satan in the form of a witch who lives nearby in the woods. How the family's disintegration is interpreted will depend on which century's point of view you choose to use.",7,50,94,10 February 2017
Arrival," Not really science fiction . . .
","But rather, a meditation on communication - how language divides as well as unites us, and how it can shape our perception of time and reality. The film also leaves us with a question for ourselves, would we choose to forego the joy of an experience if we knew for certain ahead of time that it would end in great pain. Early in the film, a linguist played by Amy Adams, writes on a white board the sentence, 'What is your purpose for coming here?' And then proceeds to explain why even such a simple question can't be can't be posed to newly arrived heptapod aliens, who's verbal language sounds a bit like whale song.Unlike any other film I can remember that deals with humans first encountering intelligent extraterrestrials, it presents what would likely be the most realistic scenario for such an event - that is, being aliens to each other the gap between us that we'd need to bridge to establish any communication would be enormous. First, we would need to teach each other how to 'speak'.Throughout the film, Adams' character experiences what we at first believe are flashbacks about a daughter she lost at a young age to a genetic disease. However, we eventually learn they are flash forwards, since as she begins to learn the alien language (which is based on a non-linear concept of time) she begins to think as they do, becoming a cognitive time traveler who can see the future and the past. The child we at first think she remembers losing, she will choose to have in the future.The film unfolds like a dream and its visuals have a dreamlike quality with very little nuts and bolts technology to be seen. These aliens seem almost beyond technology, except they they're housed in vessels (are they really space ships?) that provide a livable environment for them on Earth. When they leave, their vessels simply dissolve into mist.",9,3,6,20 July 2018
The Big Short," All too true . . .
","Twenty years of my life were spent working in housing finance economics. I got out in the early 90s after the first housing crash (when the savings & loan industry also collapsed). The things I saw that inevitably led to that first crash at the end of the 1980s, were repeated on a grander scale and with even more arrogance, greed, and callous criminality than what went before, and led to the economic crash of 2008. This film, while meant as entertainment, is also a primer on what led to the worldwide economic downturn as well as what is still wrong with financial markets today since no substantive changes have been made to prevent a recurrence. Nevertheless, it's a very watchable film with terrific performances from the entire cast, including many who are essentially walk-ons with only a few lines. It's neither dry nor dull. In fact, it's very entertaining, depressing as it can be when you realize that almost every bit of it is true.",9,1,1,21 May 2016
