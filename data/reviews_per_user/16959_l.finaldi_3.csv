Scarface," 'say hello to my leetle friend'
","Scarface. Panned on release has now become a classic of modern cinema. Reknown for having the most f###'s in it (before Goodfellas came along and stole the title)and well some quite horrific screen violence for it's day, it was meant to be De Palma's Godfather. Not quite Brian. But still an excellent film in which we see Pacino act his socks off (personally I see his role as one of the best he's ever played). The film is visually excellent as most of De Palma's films are(see Mission Impossible).With the acting, camerawork, and the script written by a pre-Platoon Oliver Stone who was shocked when a cuban gangster congratulated him on the realism of the film the movie is a gangster classic with everything taken to extremes (the amount of cocaine snorted is phenomenal)and one to rent or buy.",Null,0,0,29 May 2000
Unbreakable," Not inspiring
","I have just seen the film and thought what is all the fuss about. It begins well with an interestingly filmed conversation on a train. I sat there waiting and expecting more. The suspense was there but the conclusion of the suspense was mediocre. One keeps thinking something big will happen but the film plods to its expected/unexpected conclusion, I felt short-changed, I was practically watching the sixth sense again. Willis after all has a 'sixth sense', and can in effect see dead people. I feel that Shyamalan is, as the expression goes in London 'laughing all the way to the bank'. The twist to the story does not shed new light on the film but simply changes your perspective on a character. The twist is that you fell for the advertising and went to see the film. I can only reccomend it for it's polished framing and editing, which is interesting and well done. Shyamalan's films have depth which is what I admire about them. The framing of a shot will have it's own meaning, everything looks good. Howard delivers another forgettable score of which I am sure he will be able to sell many sound track albums, even though there is not one melody which remains, it sounds similar to Ben Hur mixed with the Sixth sense (there it is again). Shyamalan retold the sixth sense put a quality actor in it (S.L Jackson) and told us we would be knocked off our feet by the twist, the sad thing is we all believed him. 5/10",Null,0,0,29 December 2000
Goodfellas," Ever since I remember I always wanted to be a gangster!
","Scorsese's film Goodfellas is a hard one to catalogue. It is an absolute cinematic masterpiece, see the excellent tracking shots (entering the copa by the back way) and also the tense, and sweaty final scene. I have no complaints with the impeccable acting from Liotta, De Niro, and Lorraine Bracco. Joe Pesci seems to exaggerate in his portrayal of Tommy (a role which he practically copies in Casino)but I think he deserved the oscar nomination.I also have no qualms with soundtrack which is one of the finest collections of songs around, neither the scenes which although follow short narratives have an electricity about them that makes them interesting. I'm not sure about one thing or whether anyone else shares my views, but is it fun to watch something like this? These people are the lowest, slimiest, lowlifes on Earth! A question which often came to me during the film's excellent scenes was whether one feels sympathy for the characters? Not really. All of them are backstabbers and unlike other scorsese films there is no real redemption. Hill gets what he deserves. Pesci also gets what he deserves and de Niro's character is truly detestable as he tries even to kill Henry's wife. This is a question which has often crossed my mind whether it is important to feel sympathy for a character, or is it simply enough to feel any sort of emotion be it sympathy or utter dislike. In Raging Bull I'm certain that some of us watching were frightened by De Niro's portrayal of LaMotta as the evil in him was sometimes far to close to evil we have sometimes felt ourselves, it finishes, though with his redemption. Also the characters in Mean Streets, Scorsese's best film, are likeable even down to Johnny Boy who being a nut is still funny and played with pathos by the ever present De Niro. So what happened in Goodfellas? I'm not sure Scorsese would want us to love the film, appreciate it yes, but love it and praise it I don't know. It is a great character study, but, of lowlifes, people we really wouldn't want to meet.",Null,0,0,20 April 2001
