Changeling," All this make-up scenes of hope!?
","Well, I did not suppose to type anything for this one, I thought it was good enough and others should watch and feel it themselves. But after a night of sleep, I suddenly realize that Hollywood has probably made some 'stupid' changes on this so-called 'True Story'.Spoiler: In the end about this 'hope' and all, and how the woman never stop looking for her son Walter... The thing is, according to this flick, there's still a boy who knew what really happen to Walter. May be she's too lost to be aware of that, but the lawyer or the cop should know that pretty well!!So what did really happen?",5,3,8,13 February 2009
The Orphanage," Slow, slow, horribly slow and boring
","I'll be honest here, I haven't finish watching the whole movie. Not that I don't want to, it's just getting really boring. There's no suspense whatsoever till 41 minutes, cause there's where I stopped!!Compare to 'The Orphanage', 'The Others' is actually a far better movie. For those who give 'Orfanato, El' 7 out 10, please go watch 'The Others', it will blow your mind and 'Orfanato, El' off.Now I will tell you why I stopped around 40 minutes of this scenery movie. Around 35 minutes, there's the strange big noise scene ended with an old doll on Simon's bed. Well, it's funny that the husband is right downstairs and heard nothing, until his wife screams. But It's more funny on his facial expression :'Woman, what's it this time? Haven't u got anything better to do than screaming?' Then at 41 minutes, it's 6 months later. Well, I guess the writer needed 6 months of fresh air too, so do I.",3,8,19,11 May 2008
The Hurt Locker," The Propaganda - The Hurt Locker, spit and clean
","This one is probably as worst as 'Vantage Point'! Some scenes' setups are unbelievably stupid!! Actually all the bomb scenes are stupid.1st bomb scene: 'remote detonation(!!)', the bomber just has to show his face, and to detonate the bomb when the bomb disposal specialist is walking away.2nd bomb scene: 1+7 bombs, kinda in middle of a T-junction of residential area, half abandoned. Bomber is observing on few floors up of the building facing the T-junction. Once the specialist find all the bombs, the bomber starts to walk down stairs in a mini-fast pace. Specialist starts to disarm the bombs (one by one?), bomber keeps walking downstairs. The specialist is done and find a wire that lead to the side of the building, where the wire can be connected by a battery and detonate the bombs. The bomber walks out of the building, walk along the building, stops in front of the specialist for half a minute, specialist holds up the fuse he disarmed from a bomb, the bomber walks away.Let's pause here, 1st scene, one bomb, powerful enough to destroy a small building. 2nd scene, 8 bombs, and has to detonate about 10-12 meters away, with a battery!!LOL!3rd bomb scenes: 6-7 bombs in a car trunk, car parked funny next to a UN building. UN building, guarded, how can that happen!? Bomber, shoot the car from roof of a building not far. Car bursts in flame, specialist distinguishes the fire, once done, he tries to find the initiating system of the bombs...Sniper scene, most stupid, which I'm not gonna waste any more time typing it up......",1,33,80,28 January 2009
The Dark Knight," mixed feelings
","After watching it twice...I could not think of any reason why they left a cop inside the room with Joker. Why not just lock him back to his cell, or simply tire him up to a chair!? No time? Not enough men? ???Gordon : 'Whatever the Joker's planning, it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are involved. I wanna get them out of here.' What?Blame the story or be the silent guardian?Is it for the sake of making a movie, a sequel?Nolan may be losing his 'touch' since Batman...concl: Of course, there are things we could appreciate, except the story.",Null,4,8,30 November 2008
V for Vendetta," what a hype... It's just boring...
","It's just boring...I have not read the comic, and from what I heard, this film is somewhat different and its author does not want to have anything to do with the film. That kinda says a lot.I'm neutral here, even I'm a NP fan, and that means I really try to like this film. But then it's just boring, and she's definitely not likable in this Evey character.And when the ad uses 'from the directors of MATRIX' etc etc, I'm definitely expecting something more. From the trailer, I'm expecting a Sci-Fi action thriller. Sci-Fi, may be... thrill, none can find... action, just don't get me started...No one needs to argue that it could be a better film, which also means it's not that good as what it is.3.3 / 10===THE 2ND RE-VIEWAfter 4 years and 9 months, the memory of all the scenes of this film has finally filtered through the black hole of my 'not-so-'Verbose brainwave, along with the unsatisfactory feelings planted unpleasantly 4 years ago...Of course, not just the stupid ad that frame it with matrix action pack, the tasteless translation of the dialogues, and the crappy visual quality at that time in that cinema...Simply, this one worths re-viewing!7.8/10",6,7,13,22 July 2008
