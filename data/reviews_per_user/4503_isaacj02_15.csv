Hereditary," Toni Collette is astounding in Ari Aster's chilling horror debut
","Hereditary is a film that divided critics and audiences alike, with some giving it a lukewarm response and others heralding it a modern-day Exorcist. What is unarguably brilliant about this film however is its central performance in an utterly entrancing Toni Collette, well worthy of awards talk. Collette plays Annie Graham, a contemporary artist grieving over the death of her estranged mother, whose family become entangled in the supernatural after she explores the infamous practice of the séance. What slowly unfolds is a terrifying film, that grips you to your seat. To reveal much more about the plot of Hereditary would do this film a disservice; writer-director Ari Aster, even in his debut feature, shows himself to be a maestro of unexpected filmmaking that echoes of horror classics like Rosemary's Baby, yet feels alarmingly fresh and truly horrifying. The narrative of Hereditary slithers and turns slowly, expertly paced and nail-bitingly tense. It must be said that the movie is not devoid of horror tropes; what saves this occasional sink into cliché is the abundance of shocking twists in the plot and the deeper meaning behind the film. For Hereditary is not just a standard supernatural horror, but also a telling meditation on grief and mental illness. This is shown through a stand-out performance from Toni Collette, whose face alone tells of a woman truly going mad in her own fear and anger. There's an ambiguity to Hereditary which is eerily present; how much of what we are seeing is actually happening and to what extent is it just in Annie's deranged mind? The film is just as much a psychological horror, a tragic yet thrilling exploration into the darkest depths of the human consciousness. Whilst Collette is brilliant enough to carry the film alone, she is aided by a perfectly picked supporting cast. Gabriel Byrne provides a much-needed paternal gentleness as Annie's husband Steve, Alex Wolff boils with teenage angst and vulnerability as troubled son Peter, and newcomer Milly Shapiro is hypnotically creepy as even more troubled daughter Charlie. Unlike most horror ventures, the performances in Hereditary really stand out, superbly acted and never overplayed.
Artistic touches also help to elevate Hereditary, from a wonderfully grating score by Colin Stetson to Pawel Pogorzelski's incredible cinematography (wide, square shots echo Annie's miniature dollhouses, almost making us believe the film is nothing but a hellish game). Perhaps the film occasionally gets slightly wrapped up in exposition, but it still manages to be consistently compelling, helped by a stylish and sinister execution.
Hereditary brings a freshness to its genre; even with a classic setup, Ari Aster has crafted a stunningly made film, that simply reeks of pure horror.",9,0,2,20 January 2019
Rocketman," Egerton shines in electric take on the biopic genre
","Last year's Oscar-winning Queen medley Bohemian Rhapsody certainly proved that the tried and tested musical biopic is still a favoured subgenre among audiences, blending the highs and lows of artist's lives with all their greatest hits. Rhapsody's quasi-director, Dexter Fletcher takes on another charismatic and troubled figure in Rocketman, an ode to the song-writing legend that is Elton John. Fletcher's film is a fervid breath of fresh air on the biopic scene, a moving and undeniably feel-good flick that takes a look at the height of Elton's turbulent career. Rocketman is not your straight biopic by any means; first and foremost, it's an unashamed musical that dismisses the chronology of Elton's music for a smartly crafted jukebox soundtrack of some of the singer's most memorable tunes. The form of Rocketman is a stroke of genius from Dexter Fletcher; gone are the limits of factuality and linear storytelling, in favour of time-jumping and metaphors... all complete with the Elton-esque pizazz of a modern musical. From the beginning, Rocketman sets itself out from the crowd and the ride that follows is a gripping tale of love, talent and the tempestuous nature of fame.
Perhaps the greatest asset lies in a brilliant central performance from Taron Egerton. Where Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury was a remarkable turn in impressionism, Egerton's portrayal of Elton is an altogether meatier performance full of unbridled charisma and nuance. It is said that the film's subject himself requested that Egerton refrain from an impersonation and instead play 'his own version' of Elton John; this certainly comes through in Egerton's role, less of an impression but still a masterful turn from the actor, who simply engulfs the part. The supporting cast here is strong too; Jamie Bell's Bernie Taupin is a heartfelt performance and Bryce Dallas Howard is unrecognisably nasty as Elton's distant mother. Richard Madden's portrayal of the star's manager and lover John Reid is a little predictably 'boo-hiss', but this is masked by some other delightful appearances (Stephen Graham briefly steals the show by practically chewing the scenery in the first third).
Dexter Fletcher casts a smooth hand over the production, proving himself to be a sure maestro of the musical genre. Though perhaps some songs could have been more suitably placed, there are some gorgeous moments that really make use of both the energy and heart of Elton's music; a rendition of 'Your Song' sung solo by Egerton at the piano is slow and goose bump-worthy whereas the 'Saturday Night's Alright' sequence early on in the film is a joyous burst of colour and choreography. It is of course well known that much of John's career wasn't all blissful song and dance; Rocketman takes its time to reflect on the issues of substance abuse and sexuality, often in a thoughtful and compassionate way. The film certainly doesn't hide away from the flaws of its subject... and it is in Elton's many faults that the most impactful moments appear. While most of it is expertly paced, the final third suffers a little from a meandering focus, becoming a slightly repetitive chorus of psychedelic escapades and impassioned arguments that certainly takes the scenic route towards what ends up being a pleasing, if slightly cheesy conclusion.
In the end, however, there is so much that is excellent about Rocketman that makes up for its problems. It is not necessarily revolutionary (certainly not in its story) yet still manages to give its own flavour to the often placid biopic, using the music of its star not just as a plot aspect but as a structural device that really makes everything tick. Rocketman is an honest depiction of fame, both of its hardships and triumphs; it may not be all smooth sailing (with Elton's life and the film itself), but Fletcher puts forward a vigorously entertaining piece of work, bolstered by an outstanding Taron Egerton. If nothing else, you'll appreciate the mesmerising musicality of it all.",8,2,4,17 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Cooper and Gaga shine in enticing retelling
","Here, in his directorial debut, Bradley Cooper presents a third retelling of a timeless romance. It is said that each generation has their own version of A Star is Born; whether it's the 1937 original, Judy Garland's 1954 retelling or Barbra Streisand in 1976. This modern adaptation draws on that same arc of one star ascending whilst another falls, but it also feels very different; Cooper's film is a raw, affecting love story, perfect for the audiences of today.
Cooper himself stars as Jackson Maine, grizzled and drug-addled country rocker, cruising through fame down the side street of self-destruction. The film opens in the midst of an immersive rock concert... before which we see Jack swig from a bottle and pop pills on the side of the stage. Soon enough, we meet the other half of our captivating double act, as Jack stops off at a drag bar only to find Lady Gaga's Ally performing a belting version of La Vie En Rose. He's instantly smitten both with her and her undeniable talent. What follows is a love story of highs and lows, as Ally's success blooms and Cooper's Jack spirals steadily into a pit of addiction. This film not only explores the personal struggles of a relationship, but the paralysing and enticing nature of fame.
Bradley Cooper is transformative in his performance as Jackson; his gravelly tones and haggard gait make for a portrayal that is unrecognisably convincing. What is even more revolutionary, however, is Cooper's direction, an attentive approach to a story that deals with tough themes.
Lady Gaga is a powerful force as Ally; we already know this megastar's ability to dominate a stage and deliver a vocal performance, but what is even more impressive is what we see of Ally when she is still a waitress too afraid to sing the songs she writes. Gaga's performance is a compelling one and the director in Cooper is brilliant at playing to her strengths; we learn to love Ally as she grows into herself, with the help of (but not dependency on) Jack.
Ultimately, what makes A Star is Born a story worth retelling is its central romance; this film always rested entirely on that being believable. Gaga and Cooper's chemistry is simply wonderful; theirs is a real relationship, full of laughter, love and resentment. There's something so ineffable just in the way the characters look at eachother that makes their love so potent and only heightens the emotional effect of the tragedy that follows.
Whilst Jack and Ally's relationship is the obvious focus, other characters stand in the background with Sam Elliott giving a beautifully understated performance as Jack's half-brother Bobby. The relationship between Jack and Bobby is superbly done; the screenwriters know never to allow it to take too much light but it still reaches an emotional payoff in one of the best scenes. In contrast, a manipulative triangle that forms between Jack, Ally and Rafi Gavron's hissable manager is one of the weaker aspects of the film, a little too cliched and rather stunted.
There are also a few structural problems; throughout the second act, events in the story (from hastened wedding to SNL skits) stream too quickly by, yet the pace of Cooper's edit seems to drag. These are quickly resolved by the third act, however, where we are brought back to the lyrical pace of the first hour that works so well.
The soundtrack leaves one slightly underwhelmed; whilst the film's booming anthem, 'Shallow' will stick with you for days, many of the songs lack much memorability with only a few really aiding the storytelling. You almost forget about the songs however in the many concert scenes; Matthew Libatique's cinematography is judicious, an engrossing shoot, from the bright neons of Ally's tour right through to Jackson's rock concerts which we see in the same drunken haze of their star. Outside of these moments too, the film is shot with a tenderness that also manages to feel totally involving.
Early on in the film, Jackson wisely states the importance of having 'something to say and a way to say it'. This couldn't ring truer of A Star is Born; despite being a third remake, it's a retelling that feels like it was meant to be told. Two alluring lead performances and Cooper's deft direction make this film far from 'Shallow', but rather a deeply moving and dramatic love story that hits all the right notes",8,0,2,6 April 2019
Captain Marvel," A safe yet enjoyable origin tale from Marvel
","After the catastrophic events of Avengers: Infinity War (and the pleasingly droll interlude of Ant-Man and the Wasp), Marvel Studios take us back to the 90s with Captain Marvel, starring Oscar winner Brie Larson as the titular intergalactic hero. It's a film that certainly has the weight of responsibility firmly on its shoulders; not only is it an origin story packed within the developed third phase of its universe, it acts as both a link to the past (a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson is unnervingly convincing) and a bridge to what is undeniably Marvel's big event of the year, Avengers: Endgame.
Captain Marvel is entertaining enough; the script may be inconsistent, yet it hits a number of laughs and the cast, from Jude Law to Annette Bening, are a spunky ensemble that bring a bright earnestness to the film. It's a fairly standard origin story that makes unapologetic use of Marvel's signature formula, often with results that, whilst usually fun, can't help but feel slightly circumspect and contained. We watch as Larson's Vers (as she is known on her supposed home planet of Kree) crashes on Earth, her memories of her past fragmented and her identity thoroughly muddled. This is much like the film's narrative itself which feels largely scattershot, jumping through flashbacks and glossing quickly over plot points with nonchalance. That being said, the movie is very entertaining, an odd tonal balance of Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-esque retro humour and the bombastic action stakes of Star Wars. Without a doubt, it's fun, with charm obscuring the more clunky moments in the writing.
Captain Marvel, of course, relies strongly on Brie Larson's leading performance. Larson is undoubtably a terrific actress who commits wholeheartedly to the role, making the best of the disappointingly little that is given to her. In the end, whilst the scope of her powers are cause for sensation, the character herself feels lost in her own film, attempts at pathos underdone and most of the best moments going to other characters.
The extended players stand out far more, with marvellous turns by Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch and a star-studded performance from a certain feline. The cast (even Larson to an extent) are the film's saving grace, carrying the film with a jubilance that can't help but bring a smile to the face.
Other aspects of the film also shine; the visual effects are polished and a distinctly 90s jukebox soundtrack works well. Far from spending its time in space, most of the film is grounded on good ol' Planet Earth, packed full of satisfying nods to the period.
All said, Captain Marvel is a tricky film; it can't help but feel like a stepping stone to the next point of the overall narrative of the universe, a safe and unambitious adventure muddied in franchise building. For me, however, the quirky humour, visual thrills and undeniable sense of fun are enough to give Captain Marvel a watch.",7,0,2,9 March 2019
Us," Terrifying and trenchant horror from Jordan Peele
","After his Oscar-winning directorial debut Get Out in 2017, the inimitable Jordan Peele returns with Us, a terrifying look at both personal and societal demons. We are introduced to the Wilsons, led by jovial patriarch Gabe (Winston Duke) and his reserved wife Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), on a vacation to the beaches of Santa Cruz with their two kids (Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex). Gabe's enthusiasm for holiday hobbies is unshared by Adelaide, a victim of childhood trauma who begins to feel uneasy after a series of unnerving coincidences start to plague their idyllic trip. Her fears are not unfounded, as the family are soon terrorised by doppelgangers in what proves to be a horror thrill-ride, thoughtfully executed by Jordan Peele.
Peele is a maestro of the genre; he has an uncanny way of knowing both when to play into horror tropes and when to subvert them completely, resulting in a film that grips the audience in its unpredictability. So many elements are combined in Us; there's old-fashioned slasher horror and classic home invasion, accompanied by the suspense and sharp comedy of Get Out. Even more satisfying, however, is Peele's inclusion of underlying social commentary, a subtle satire perhaps echoed in the film's title (are we talking about the pronoun or looking at a critique of U.S society?). Us may lack the deft narrative control of Get Out, but in some ways it's an even more impressive feat of filmmaking, equally thought-provoking and thematically complex, yet more ambitious and inventive. The entire movie is shrouded in a layer of ambiguity; Peele is giving us the freedom to interpret it in whatever way we wish. Some will see Us as more of a metaphor, others as a social statement... many will also see it as simply a gorily entertaining crowd-pleaser and the film functions gloriously even as just that. It's not without the occasional plot-hole, but if these inspire Peele to return to the 'Us-verse' for another film to clear up the gaps, they will all have been worth it.
Us is elevated by a selection of fantastic performances, notable by the fact that every actor plays two roles, that of their character and their throat-slitting counterpart. Lupita Nyong'o is a force of silent determination as Adelaide and oozes steely creepiness as the leader of the subterranean 'Tethered', Red. Winston Duke's Gabe is the soft-hearted master of the dad joke, yet his twin is wonderfully menacing. The two kids are fantastic and Elisabeth Moss is brilliant as always. In the third act, the film becomes slightly more unfocused, but the cast keep it buoyant with spirited performances.
Visually, the film is absolutely gorgeous, Mike Gioulakis' cinematography making expert use of reflections as a terrifying motif to keep us on the edge of our seats. Homage is paid to other horror classics; an overhead car shot reminds one of the Torrances arriving at the Overlook in 'The Shining' and haunting dance interludes echo of Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan'. Even with this, Us feels like an original product, unapologetically strange and stylish. Michael Abels' score is also a gem, an amalgamation of itchy strings, taiko drums and Satanic choirs. Jukebox choices in certain scenes are also well-judged (let's just say, Luniz's I Got 5 On It will have a whole new meaning).
With Us, Jordan Peele seems to have broken the sophomore curse, cementing his status as one of the most exciting filmmakers working today. It's the kind of film where, with every return viewing, you will notice more and more clever touches that lie hidden in its rich textures. Horrifying, trenchant and unique, Us is another success from Jordan Peele.",9,3,7,23 March 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee strikes gold in fierce sociopolitical satire
","Spike Lee has always been a refreshingly brazen filmmaker; with movies like Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X, the director is not one to shy away from political statements all delivered with distinct style and zest. The same is true of Lee's latest film, the creatively helmed BlacKkKlansman, a fictionalised telling of the memoir of black Colorado cop, Ron Stallworth and his risky infiltration of the Ku Klux Klan. Here, Spike Lee is at his best, painting an enticing tonal mix of humour and horror that feels all too topical.
Son of Denzel, John David Washington stars as Stallworth, the so-called 'Jackie Robinson of the Colorado Springs Police Department' and the first black officer. Ron's ethnic background makes him the man for an undercover mission spying on black activist Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins), as he excites the city's discontented African-American community. Soon enough, however, Ron is caught up at the other end of the racial spectrum as he and partner Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) attempt to infiltrate their local chapter of the KKK by posing as a budding white supremacist. It's a life-risking double act as Flip becomes the 'face' of Ron Stallworth, as the real Ron rises the ranks through incidental phone calls with KKK Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace).
BlacKkKlansman is a film that presents racism in an interesting way, almost as a dichotomy between the ridiculous and threatening. The script is a genius work, jolting along with the speed of a bullet between moments of almost absurdist comedy to those of darker truth. A particularly good example is that of a racist couple cosying up to one another in bed, dreamily discussing their plans for homemade terrorism. This is a film where white supremacy is served with cheese and crackers and social commentary is accompanied by bizarre humour. Lee does a superb job of balancing these tones, catching the laughs in one's throat within a net of horror. This clashing approach continues throughout the film, even into Terence Blanchard's innovative score, which jumps from the safety of strings to impassioned guitar riffs.
Washington and Driver are two very-well cast leads; the former's delightfully dry yet nuanced performance allows the film to stay grounded. Driver's performance is equally captivating; in many ways, Flip has the scarier side of the job, having to meet the members of the Klan face to face hoping they believe the caricature and stay masked to his Jewish heritage. An opening cameo by Trump-impersonator himself, Alec Baldwin reminds one of the trenchant relevance of Lee's film; the costume design and jukebox soundtrack lend it all the authenticity of a 70s period piece, but the inclusion of Trumpist slurs, ironic asides and a heart wrenching final sequence remind us that BlacKkKlansman is very much a film for today. There are points where the film seems a little too self-aware, but perhaps it is intended to be; from the profane tagline right to the end credits, Lee is truly in control of his craft and the message he wants to put forward. Performances by Washington and Driver are brilliant and credit is due to Get Out's Jordan Peele for the pitch, but the real star here is Spike Lee. With BlacKkKlansman, the director returns to form with satire as it should be; sickeningly hilarious, yet equally as shocking and, most of all, with something important to say.",9,3,6,17 April 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Stylish and energised; Spider-Man gets a new spin
","Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are known for their penchant for irreverent comedy; 21 Jump Street and The Lego Movie immediately pop to mind with a grin. Here the talented pair, along with Avi Arad and Peter Ramsey, turn their hand to a beloved Marvel item who is no stranger to a reboot; Spider-Man. But, this time we're not being subjected to yet another Uncle Ben death scene; Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse tells the origin story of another Spidey, plucky teen, Miles Morales (an energetic Shameik Moore) as he grapples with the infamous Kingpin (Liev Schreiber), helped by a number of inter-dimensional 'Spider-people'... including a washed-up, cynical Peter Parker (voiced with a nonchalant drawl by Jake Johnson). We watch as Miles grapples with finding his feet after an unfortunate interaction with a radioactive arachnid, in a hearty and humorous adventure, that feels distinctly Lord and Miller.
Into the Spider-Verse is a noticeably different adaptation of the friendly neighbourhood superhero; from the outset, the film cheekily satirises the incessant rebooting of its character (a flashback to a certain Spider-Man 3 moment gives perhaps the biggest laugh). Plenty of fun is poked out of comic-book movie tropes too; this doesn't change the fact however that, plot-wise, Into the Spider-Verse has little to offer in terms of originality, its narrative as predictable as a Saturday morning TV cartoon.
The film almost makes this redundant, however, through a stylish and confident execution, that feels fresh. Lord and Rodney Rothman's script is full of wry humour, quick-witted, yet full of heart and honesty. Miles Morales is also a more fleshed out lead than we are used to from Marvel (despite a slightly easy resolution to his arc) and his band of misfits, whilst largely one-note, are fun enough to carry the film with ease. Brian Tyree Henry and Mahershala Ali are unfeigned as Miles' father and uncle respectively and Jake Johnson is simply brilliant in an incarnation of Peter Parker hitherto undreamt of. An antagonist in the form of Kingpin is more disappointing, a forced motivation leaving him uninteresting and decidedly by-the-numbers. The movie leaves us little time to think on its faults though; it takes a relentless, yet natural, pace through riveting action sequences and comedic montages, with the ease of a web swing.
Into the Spider-Verse's greatest strength, however, is its design. The animation is unique and aesthetic, delightfully reminiscent of an old-school comic strip. The film feels like a very real homage to its source material, the comic in comic book movie always coming first. Into the Spider-Verse won't be remembered for breaking ground in plot and character, but its design alone is enough to make you want to go back for more.
Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have assembled a fun and frenetic film which, whilst standard on paper, is executed with artistry and flair. An incarnation of the world's favourite superhero surely to be remembered.",8,1,2,30 December 2018
Yesterday," More misses than hits in Boyle and Curtis' sluggish ode to The Beatles
","There's no movie premise more fun than the 'what if' question; void of the wonderings of why and the logistics of a situation we are simply allowed to accept it and enjoy the fantasy that follows. Here, Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis approach a weighty 'what if' question to terrify all music aficionados... what if the Beatles never existed? Or, more suitably, what if only one man (luck would have it a down-on-his-luck singer-songwriter) remembered their classic tunes? In Yesterday, that man is Jack Malik (Himesh Patel in his big-screen debut), who is conveniently hit by a bus simultaneously as a split-second power outage hits the globe. Jack awakens in this all but identical parallel dimension; except no one has heard of John, Paul, George or Ringo. It's not long before our protagonist starts to realise that this isn't a curse but rather a blessing as he starts to gain huge success by painstakingly recreating the band's songs and claiming them as his own to the unknowing world.
The concept of Yesterday is an intriguing one, if a little familiar. What would perhaps be most exciting about the film however is that it sees two tour de forces of British cinema, Boyle and Curtis, working together for the first time. In Yesterday, it feels as if Boyle's contribution seems slightly smothered in the tone and style of the latter; this feels very much like a Richard Curtis affair and unfortunately not an entirely brilliant one. In the first third of the film, the pace breezes nicely along; we are introduced to Jack and his hum-drum life, including his curious relationship with manager Ellie (the endlessly charismatic Lily James). There's some classic Curtis writing here; joshing banter, wry humour and a good level of heart. A notably great scene comes from comedy powerhouses Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Sayal as Jack's parents, one of many early moments that makes what is to follow look promising.
It is a huge shame, therefore, that Yesterday slides off the rails, leaving behind its interesting premise to settle as a forgettable and frankly quite dull romcom that feels like lesser work from both Boyle and Curtis. There's one particular sequence where the film makes a horrifically misjudged turn and, from then on, meanders and warbles to a barely conclusive and unsatisfying ending. Himesh Patel leads the cast as Jack and one can't fault his utter commitment to what I'm sure will be a career-boosting role. However, despite this, Jack is a fundamentally unlikeable character; throughout the film he lumbers and sulks his way from screen-to-screen to the point that one wonders why we care about him in the first place. The same is true of the rest of the cast; Kate McKinnon does her best as a one-dimensional corporate music manager whose comedic novelty swiftly wears off and even James, who charmed the roof off in last year's Mamma Mia sequel, is given very little to work with. I hate to say that the real problem here seems to lie in Curtis' writing; whilst there are a few funny moments and characters (Joel Fry is superb as the hapless Rocky echoing Rhys Ifans in a better Curtis outing Notting Hill), largely there's very little to Yesterday that gives in any sort of kick. The 'what if' scenario that actually could be interesting seems always to be playing second place to Patel and James' bland love story, a 120-min will-they-won't-they... despite the fact we know they will. After the first third, there are occasional beads of hilarity and heart but these are largely lost within a sea of banal aimlessness that feels like borderline laziness on behalf of its creators who we know can do so much more. Equally, there are other aspects of Yesterday that don't play in its favour; the jukebox soundtrack is limited and underplayed, the editing choices are bizarre and the graphic effects tragically tacky.
That is not to say that Yesterday doesn't have its moments; Patel's rendition of the titular hit early on is an empathetically portrayed sequence and a scene featuring a leading Beatle is beautifully poignant. Plus there are some brilliant supporting performances from the likes of Bhaskar, Sayal and Fry. In fact, it is these faint glimmers of what Yesterday could have been that make the end result even more disappointing. In the end, the clever premise is left behind in favour of a cliched, muddled and overlong summer romcom that won't go down in history like the Beatles any time soon.",5,5,13,6 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A splendid and rewarding conclusion from Marvel
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has certainly revolutionised modern cinema; back in 2008, Iron Man opened to positive reviews but few foresaw the cultural phenomenon this world was to become and the generation of adoring fans it was to muster. Eleven years on and the highly anticipated climax of this particular saga of the MCU hits the screens; Avengers: Endgame. Its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War may have ended on a rather low note for Earth's mightiest heroes, as intergalactic despot Thanos succeeded in wiping out half the universe, but they return in full force in this ambitious and decidedly bombastic conclusion.
From the beginning, Marvel old hands The Russo Brothers paint a very new world, a greyer one wracked by Thanos' deadly 'Snap'. Among the surviving Avengers, there's a strong sense of survivor's guilt and very little sense of hope... yet it would be unlike the characters we know to not make one last attempt to save the universe.
To divulge in any more detail the plot of Avengers: Endgame would be to severely undermine its impact; this is a cinematic thrill-ride, with surprises aplenty, nodding dollops of fan service and a hefty level of emotional stakes. One thought the sheer scale of Infinity War was seismic, but the Russos outdo themselves with Endgame, crafting a climactic and grandiose, but equally satisfying conclusion to a decade of work. It's a different beast to its predecessors in many ways, but Endgame still manages to pull off that nifty balance between humour and drama that makes Marvel work.
The film can only be described as a victory lap for Marvel, a love letter to their characters and fans. After a brilliantly unexpected prologue, the film takes a little while to find its rhythm, but once it does... it really does. Credit is due particularly to Christopher Markus' and Stephen McFeely's script, a quick-witted and compassionate piece of work that propels the story breezily through its three-hour run time. Despite the Avengers' predicament, it isn't all doom and gloom; the benefits of a smaller ensemble cast allow Endgame to have that same sense of banter from Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble, something that occasionally felt missed within the tidal action of the latter part of Infinity War. Within the first hour, the plot is taken on a definitive path, one that is neither untrodden (there is a memorable comic sequence where the characters wryly commentate on this) nor particularly smooth (plot inaccuracies can easily be raised). Despite this, however, it allows the film to take off on what can only be described as a golden reward for Marvel fans, an action-packed feast of a film that pays due homage to its universe. There's also a biting edge to Endgame though in its emotional resonance, frequently heart-breaking yet never gratuitous. There are so many aspects that are so caringly rendered in Endgame; Alan Silvestri's diverse score and the textured visual effects spring eagerly to mind.
As always in a Marvel caper, the cast is a blisteringly good ensemble effort. In Endgame, every actor is on top form, bouncing off eachother with natural ease. Josh Brolin's scene-stealing Thanos from Infinity War is disappointingly less on show here, but this is almost made up for the excellent use of some of the previous film's more underused players (Chris Evans' Captain America and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow are given meatier roles here). A special mention should also go to Robert Downey Jr in a performance that radiates power and poignancy. Avengers: Endgame does sacrifice itself occasionally in the complex myriad of stories it tells; at points, there are a few too many of these vignettes and the film can feel a tad clunky (Infinity War gave the arc to its villain to combat this). However, the paths all lead pretty much perfectly together in a third act that is indisputably awesome and packs an emotive punch.
Avengers: Endgame is a monumental piece of cinema, both in scale and significance; these stories have defined childhoods and, here, a fitting end is delivered to this part that not only feels satisfyingly conclusive but is excellently put together by the creative force behind it. Colossal and captivating, this is another sure success from the team at Marvel that looks difficult to beat.",9,0,1,29 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Familiar yet fun escapades with Woody and the gang
","Some may say the first three Toy Story movies are a prime example of the practically perfect trilogy; heart-warming, intelligent and entertaining, Woody, Buzz and the gang have become pop culture staples that have defined the childhoods of a generation. I approached Toy Story 4 with a healthy level of scepticism; what more could possibly be added to this franchise that had culminated in such a faultless conclusion? Yet here stands a fourth instalment, asked for or not... that in many ways keeps itself comfortably in the formula we know and love.
As we saw by the tear-jerking finale of 3, our favourite bunch of toys now spend their days playing with 'their new kid' Bonnie. Toy Story 4 starts off with a fuzzy familiarity that eases us in... until the introduction of a new character, Forky (a neurotic spork voiced superbly by Tony Hale). Expectedly, Forky becomes lost in a circus in the midst of a family road trip; it's up to Woody to get him back. The adventurous escapades that ensue are undoubtably good fun; for me, it felt like a much more low-key Toy Story film, the grandiose nature of some of its predecessors replaced with something smaller and more character driven. First time Pixar director Josh Cooley and writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom put together a neat package full of clever humour and all those other qualities that make a Toy Story film tick. Naturally it wouldn't be a Pixar outing if some deeper themes weren't explored; in Toy Story 4 we delve into questions of sentience, loyalty and purpose with all the maturity and compassion you would expect from this studio.
Tom Hanks once again delivers a heartfelt vocal performance as Woody, giving more raw humanity to a cowboy doll than should be allowed. Though this is suitably Woody's story, he is flanked by a colourful cast of supporting characters; notably, Annie Potts gives gusto to an old face and Key and Peele lend their talent to some delightfully fluffy comic relief. I would have liked to have seen a bigger role for some veteran Toy Story alumni (what are Jessie and the Potato Heads doing these days?), but the newer players are a lovable lot... and the level of fun you can tell Keanu Reeves is having as Duke Caboom is enviable. Every character and the world around them is fully realised in simply breath-taking animation, hyper-realistic yet still with a slick sense of style.
The question can still be raised, however, of the necessity of this film's existence. The truth is, apart from brief moments, we're retreading old ground here, exploring familiar themes and ideas. Whilst this typical Toy Story fare is successful in pushing the nostalgia buttons and entrapping us in escapism, there's very little new that is being brought to the table. From the storyline to Randy Newman's jubilant score, it's a caper we've seen before that loses just a bit of its charm. Despite this, however, Toy Story 4 is still a sure hit for Pixar and knocks most franchise four-quels out of the water in pretty much every way. For some, its conclusion will prove to be another tug at the heart strings... and even if (like me) you don't quite buy it, the whole thing is sure to leave you with a warm, pleasant feeling inside. All in all, Toy Story 4 may not be a revelation but it's a kind-hearted, amusing and entertaining film that harks back to everything you loved about the other movies. If only for that, it's certainly worth your time.",8,0,1,28 June 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Slick, stylish and ferociously funny
","Wes Anderson is perhaps one of the most delightfully unusual filmmakers working today, his films characterised by picturesque symmetry, wry humour and more than a hint of the macabre. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no different and actually stands as one of Anderson's finest films; it's precisely choreographed, gorgeous to look at and, above all, an intelligent comedy that pays homage to bygone cinema whilst adding its own unique spin.
Though the action may jump time periods (whether it's from Tom Wilkinson's direct narrator or F. Murray Abraham's narrator within the story), it centres around The Grand Budapest Hotel, an elite establishment for the rich and pampered in the fictional state of Zubrowka. Our attention is immediately turned to M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the hotel's concierge, who tends to the guests with a managed slickness... that is when he isn't courting dowagers into his room. The film takes off on a race of storytelling, as Gustave is framed for the murder of an old lover (a prosthetic-clad Tilda Swinton) and must flee the law and who knows else with only the help of his protégé, lobby boy, Zero (a suitably boyish Tony Revelori, when not played 30 years down the line by a mellow F. Murray Abraham).
The film is a delightful farce, Anderson and Hugo Guiness' script providing intelligent and subtle comedy that delivers even amid such a frenetic and occasionally scatty pace. For the most part though, The Grand Budapest Hotel is as tightly wound as one could expect from Wes Anderson; even amid the absurdity of ski chases and severed fingers, there's a remarkable level of control to the madness, helped along by Anderson's assured writing and direction.
Employed in the cast is a who's who of star-studded spectacle; Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan are plot-central, but around them are bit cameos from the likes of Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Lea Seydoux. Fiennes leads with rapier-sharp timing as Gustave, his performance radiating clipped composure, all complete with an irresistible charm. The supporting cast are admittedly largely one-note (occasionally the abundance of celebrity proves a little distracting) but are earnest enough to drive the film through.
Where the film has perhaps received the highest praise, however, is its design. The Grand Budapest hotel is a visual treat, its design vibrant yet avowedly architected. There's almost a sense of the characters having been painted on screen; from the bright colours, sharp angles and miniature set pieces, the film feels as much a spectacle of art as an espionage romp. Alexandre Desplat's score is perfectly judged, the musical voice established by the distinct and innovative use of the balalaika. The film is shot with equal verve, snapping from camera ratios incessantly to produce an energised and unexpected cinematography that boosts the narrative. At points, the movie may be a case of style over substance, but the film's unusual design only seems to enhance one's enjoyment of it.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a strange film, a comedy full of black humour and gentlemanly profanity. Thoroughly entertaining and visually enchanting, this is certainly a gem from Wes Anderson.",9,1,1,19 February 2019
The Favourite," A darkly humorous spin on the period drama
","With Olivia Colman set to follow on from Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth in the third season of The Crown, it seems a satisfying coincidence that Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film The Favourite sees the actress take on the role of another monarch. The Crown may be the dictionary definition of period drama, but The Favourite is a very different affair, a tantalising twist on what often promises to be a dull sub-genre.
Here, Colman stars as Anne, the last Stuart queen 'stalked by tragedy', ravaged by gout and depression, with her pet rabbits her only solace. She has passed on the keys of power to her closest confidant and secret lover, Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), but all is turned on its head with the arrival of Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) a once noblewoman whose family has fallen on hard times. As Abigail surprisingly gains the favour of the Queen, so begins a ruthless battle that plays out before our eyes in a particularly captivating power struggle between the three women.
The Favourite is an enthralling film; Lady Sarah and Abigail turn loyalty into an increasingly vicious blood sport, making for a narrative littered with gratifying double-crossing, carnal intensity and stylish brutality, all accompanied by an almost illusionary sense of madness. It can only be defined as a tragicomedy, subtly hilarious yet hiding timely subtext that is delightfully ambiguous. The lines between love and deception are expertly blurred in a film that takes no prisoners in its uproarious execution. There is more deliberation in the overblown final act, however, that feels lengthy and distinctly less focused than the rest of the film.
The movie finds its greatest strength in its stellar cast, led by Colman, Stone and Weisz. Colman is outstanding as Anne, hilariously petulant and childlike, reminiscent of Miranda Richardson's Queenie in Blackadder. There's a blunt imperiousness to Colman's performance that carries the film through with black humour. Beyond this, however, the scenes of greatest emotional resonance are those that show the more tragic side of Anne, as a woman who has lost seventeen children ('Some were born in blood, some without breath and some were with me a very brief time') and has never recovered from the trauma. Colman breezes through these harsher scenes that cut surprisingly deep and help to give the film a greater purpose.
Rachel Weisz is the epitome of calculated steeliness as Lady Sarah and Emma Stone is pitch perfect in her first period role as the opportunistic and marvellously Machiavellian Abigail. Nicholas Hoult's flamboyant Leader of the Opposition leads several foppish male roles, but these lie clearly in the peripheral; Yorgos Lanthimos makes apparent that the film's sole focus is its women, all of whom are callous, yet vulnerable, but all quite brilliant in different ways.
The Favourite is beautifully designed, lavish costumes by Sandy Powell and a regal set giving the film all the expected grandeur of a period drama. The film's more salacious side, however, is shown in Robbie Ryan's absurdist cinematography which, whilst occasionally pretentious, gives a haunting contemporary spin. I was less of a fan of the wide-angled bend shots, as well as the film's soundtrack (from Handel to the itchy modernism of Anna Meredith), which felt invasive and ceaseless.
Here, Yorgos Lanthimos has struck a fine chord. The Favourite is a wonderfully unusual and unsettling film that is at points gratuitous, but generally audacious and exciting. Spellbinding performances and an intriguing story make this not one to miss out on.",9,5,11,6 January 2019
Whiplash," An electrifying breakthrough for Damien Chazelle
","Damien Chazelle has become a notable rising star in film direction in the past decade; his 2016 musical, La La Land was the subject of the infamous Best Picture mess-up at the 89th Oscars. Despite this, after a Best Director win, Chazelle has been tipped as a great and one of his films that demonstrates this perfectly is his 2014 breakthrough, Whiplash, the story of an ambitious young student under the tutorage of an abusive music instructor. Chazelle has crafted an exhilarating and detailed film, owing less to a La La Land-esque musical but rather to sports movies, like Rocky. Miles Teller stars as Andrew, a young and hugely ambitious drum protégé desperate to impress his notorious instructor, Terence Fletcher. J.K Simmons stars as Fletcher and is certainly the star of the film; his muscular physique and sharp tongue create a monster, yet one who remains human enough to remain terrifyingly believable. Slowly, we see the film turn into a game of cat and mouse as Andrew is relentless in his pursuit to impress Fletcher, who argues that tough love is the only way to breed musicians that make history. Whiplash is brutal when it needs to be, Tom Cross' editing adding a sharp execution (often cutting to the central drum kit) to Chazelle's attentive direction. The film is unforgiving in its pace, managing to turn even the most permissive drum solos into gripping dramatic set pieces. Even as the film descends into melodrama, plot-wise (literal car crashes begin to overtake the metaphorical), Whiplash never loses that golden forcefulness and intensity that makes it work so well. For a film about music, Justin Hurwitz provides a fitting score, his striking, bouncy music immersed within the jazz standards. The score feels like the film itself; brassy and pacy, yet somehow relaxed and perfectly measured at the same time.
Whiplash is a fine film; Chazelle's aptitude for detailed and thoughtful direction is clear and, even when the story trails into the unbelievable, you can't bring your eyes way. Simmons is stellar in his performance, his delicious brutality making him well deserving of his Oscar. Whilst La La Land shows Chazelle paying homage to the bygone movie musical, its predecessor is a very different film; nail-biting and uncompromising, Whiplash is a very accomplished piece of filmmaking",9,0,0,31 December 2018
Black Panther," Subverting expectations; Coogler takes on Marvel's most exciting story yet
","Few predicted the level to which Marvel's Black Panther would become a cultural phenomenon. Director Ryan Coogler's addition to the MCU received acclaim from critics and audiences alike, as well as breaking an impressive $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Perhaps key to the success of Black Panther is the way that it thrills both fans of the superhero flick but also transcends the usual bounds of the genre, in its characters, design and themes. This is a film that subverts the typical Marvel formula, something which is long overdue.
Chadwick Boseman comfortably leads the film as the eponymous hero, venerable monarch by day and suit-sporting vigilante by night. T'Challa rules the nation of Wakanda, a futuristic and technologically advanced utopia shielded by a mask as a third-world nation. T'Challa's ex-lover, Nakia (played on expected brilliant form by Lupita Nyong'o) fights the case for Wakanda's moral duty to share the truth of their wealth; this is one of many surprisingly complex questions which weave their way satisfyingly into the narrative. Taking this even further is the film's villain, Erik Killmonger, a Wakandan isolated from the kingdom, calling for a revolution by black people against their oppressors. Michael B. Jordan is a charismatic villain, wonderful shades of humanity embedded within his performance, providing a fitting and scarily relatable foe for the Black Panther. A spunky ensemble (though prone to spouting exposition) completes the mix, Letitia Wright's Shuri acting as the Q to T'Challa's Bond and Martin Freeman delightfully Watson-esque as an obliging CIA agent.
For the most part, Black Panther is a stunning movie to witness, embracing its Afro-futurism with a colourful and vibrant design. The film feels very much buried in its cultural roots, which gives some understanding to the film's significance. Ludwig Goransson provides a luscious and innovative score and rap numbers courtesy of Kendrick Lamar complement the action.
The action sequences in the movie are also riveting; 'I never freeze' pronounces T'Challa coolly in an early scene... and neither does the film itself. Pace never lags in relentless and sharp action sequences, gripping the audiences to their seats and, at some points, providing a strong emotional pay-off. The final act is certainly where the film is at its most disappointing, descending into an increasingly loud and banal CGI-fest, which, whilst not uncommon in a Marvel flick, is certainly beneath the calibre of Black Panther. Visual effects are also dodgy at certain instances, oddly plasticky and unfinished-looking. For the most part, however, Black Panther delivers soundly for popcorn moviegoers, never allowing its themes and cultural statements to overtake the pure entertainment.
One only has to see Black Panther to understand the reasons behind its sensation and the whisper of Oscars floating around. Ryan Coogler has crafted a visually staggering blockbuster, which manages to tell an engrossing story, with plenty of popcorn thrills, yet also a remarkably deep cultural message that boasts great relevance. Black Panther is without a doubt one of the most exciting and inventive Marvel outings yet.",8,2,5,29 December 2018
Green Book," Mortensen and Ali shine in charming ride through the Deep South
","Director Peter Farrelly is certainly best known for his big-hearted, light comedies; from Dumb and Dumber to There's Something About Mary, Farrelly has shown himself to be a sure hand at the genre. His new film, Green Book, employs much of the same warm comedy, but along with a far more dramatic narrative.
Green Book is the (though now debatably) true story of Italian-American bar bruiser, Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), who finds work as a driver for a renowned black pianist, Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he embarks on a concert tour across the Deep South. The film explores the growing friendship of the two men against the ugly backdrop of segregated America.
There is plenty of fun to be had in Green Book; as expected of Farrelly, there's an effortless charm to the film, supported by belly-laughing humour and spirited characters. The script is occasionally a little clunky, but what truly ensures the success of Green Book is its performances (both Oscar noms). Viggo Mortensen leads as Tony, a big-mouthed big eater, impressively humorous but also adding an emotive touch to a role that could have easily seemed like a caricature. There's a huge heart to Mortensen's lively performance that is somewhat captivating. This is played off nicely by Mahershala Ali, on usual expert form as Dr Shirley. Ali's composure and poise lend his performance this quiet gravitas that seems to find its true culmination in the film's most powerful scene, as Tony and Don argue in the rain as two minorities unaccepted in 1960s America.
It seems a shame, however, that the aforementioned scene is the closest that Green Book gets to really addressing its subject. The racial themes of the film are swiftly glossed over for the most part, even from the beginning where we see an apparently prejudiced Tony dispose of the drinking glasses of two black workmen, only to be seen happily kneeling on the ground playing dice with a group of African Americans some twenty minutes later. The film doesn't just discuss race; class and sexuality are also lingering themes, but both feel all too briefly mentioned. There are certain scenes that do tackle the issues head on and I loved those moments, but much of the film is coated in a layer of sentimentality that, certainly by the third act, becomes almost sugary.
That being said, however, I loved the warmer and lighter points of the film as much as I loved the more dramatic. Though helped certainly by the brilliant performances, Green Book's sentimentality doesn't stop it from being voraciously watchable. The final act drags, suitably like a car with a flat tyre, but otherwise the film is infectiously entertaining, bringing across its narrative in the most accessible way. In the end, perhaps Green Book isn't intended to be a gritty account on race relations; though there is more opportunity for nuanced drama, it feels far more like a feel-good crowd-pleaser.
In the end, Green Book may be a little simplistic in approach for more cultivated audiences, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining romp, made successful by two standout performances.",7,1,1,3 February 2019
