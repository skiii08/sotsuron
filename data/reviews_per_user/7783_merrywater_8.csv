Saturday Night Fever," Lament to a by-gone era
","Before I ever saw this movie I had happen to see Grease, which I did not like. I never got this 50s nostalgia, and the story was corny. Now, Saturday Night Fever, which isn't related to Saturday Night Live in any way, has as an engaging story enhanced by great disco music without being a musical. It's actually rather similar to Fame, the movie, having a similar message: the entertainment business as a vehicle out of the ghetto. Perhaps not very ingenious or innovative. The picture deals with other themes too, such as racial issues, religion and sex, but only subordinately. Over-all good acting and dancing.Interesting this 70s disco music phenomenon: it developed out of soul/funk, and Barry White was crucial to its genesis as his Love's Theme was the first hit to be referred to as 'disco'. The new genre was endorsed by artists that were not predominantly Afro-American, adding an international flavour and popularity. 'Disco' was not prone to develop much further than White's sound of 1973, though, and in 1979 there was even an anti-disco movement called 'Disco Sucks!' that culminated in mass burning of disco records at a stadium in Chicago.Saturday Night Fever did capture the essence of the era with regard to the clubbing side of it. One thing that does surprise me is that the fashion they wore didn't match the class and ever-greenness of the music: polyester...",7,0,1,2 May 2015
The Big Lebowski," Why didn't he just wash the rug?
","This story circulates around a bum like perpetual hippie apparently living on some kind of assets as the story makes a point of him being out of work. He's a lazy, viscously phlegmatic and self centered persona.Some 'hired help' enters his home and almost flushes his head down the WC. The reason for this is not clear but obviously they mistook him for a different guy with the same name, The 'Big' Lebowski, who's enormously well off and sits in a wheel-chair. Some kind of revenge or threat. Anyhow, they pee on the hippie namesake's oriental rug. And thus the story starts rolling.Now, if you know anything about rugs you'd know that you can actually wash off pee. It's done regularly in Iran where almost every home is furnished up the walls in hand manufactured rugs and carpets, and where young kids might pee, or worse, on them.This picture, on the other hand, is not washable. After seeing it a dozen of times, I still don't get what it's all about.The story is too blurry and unintelligible to summarize.It's entertaining, though, and the soundtrack is great.I get the feeling that the Coen Bros really wanted to impress Tarantino, as TBL could well have been a comic book story, just like Pulp Fiction.",5,12,23,28 December 2014
Rush," Feels like a TV show
","I was highly recommended to watch this. Unfortunately I found Rush to be rather unintriguing which is sad as especially the Niki Lauda story is rather touching. I remember it well from childhood, being interested in cars and racing at the time.Rush lacks depth. The acting is shallow and underdeveloped.The seventies setting is also rather unconvincing.Perhaps it is that I don't dig the direction of today, and unfamiliar with the current stars.Rush feels to me more as a soap opera or something.Quite surprising that it is rated 8,2 as an average here at IMDb.",2,3,10,17 September 2015
North by Northwest," The 39 Steps/Saboteur/North by Northwest
","Hitchcock made this movie three times: the first was released in 1935 called 'The 39 Steps', the second in 1942 called 'Saboteur', and the third in 1959 named 'North by Northwest'.The basic ingredients are: (1) A lonely man wrongfully accused of something he didn't do. (2) His wanting to have himself in the clear. (3) His incapacity of turning his case over to justice. (4) His pursuit of the party who incriminated him. (5) His involvement in between with a blond girl that he can't trust. (6) His final encounter with his nemesis, preferably at a spectacular site.'The 39 Steps' is truly a masterpiece, for it is still mesmerizes you in spite of being filmed 80 years ago! Which other movie that old does that? None whatsoever, I dare you. (The next likely candidate, 'The Lady Vanishes' was only released three years later, and was directed by the Master of Suspense as well.)Now, 'North by Northwest' would have been this masterpiece, had it not been preceded by 'The 39 Steps'. 'Noth by Northwest' has some unforgettable moments as the pesticide aircraft chase, but the plot is anything but new.'Saboteur' differs from the other two pictures in being excessively patriotic and antifascist, somewhat of war propaganda, shot during WWII as it was. It does have some exciting moments, but having seen the other two movies in the 'trilogy', it just sticks out as the lesser attempt of them.",Null,1,2,28 December 2014
Psycho," B/W is Best
","Do we actually need color pictures? How come that this in that perspective so outdated movie still does its job so much better than colored counterparts?In fact, I ask myself why other film makers still insist on color instead of B/W knowing the impact of Psycho and Film Noir. There are some clever adaptations, though viz the bleak colors, such as in Seven, Sixth Sense and The Ring. Psychological horror tends to fade to gray.Well, despite all this, Hitchcock's the Suspense Master and Psycho is his best film. I'd like to compare to Agatha Christie's best story, the 6th most sold novel of all times, Ten Little N*****s aka And Then There Were None: there is something crude about both productions. TLN is not very elaborated in its language, rather straightforward. Yet, the background information about each victim is direct and convincing. The main plot is fantastic and the atmosphere the novel brings at least got me entangled in it.Now, Psycho on the other hand, has a less fantastic story: it could happen that a girl at large ends in a gloomy motel at the will of a mentally ill murderer. The similarity rather lies in the movie's lack of pretension, in stark contrast to say, Vertigo. Besides this comparison, it's noteworthy that Psycho<ul><li>started of the slasher type flicks, complete with the eerie staccato musical score </li></ul><ul><li>introduced and indulged in various new elements in film such as a toilet bowl close up </li></ul><ul><li>is a two act movie: first act is about the female protagonist's stealing of money, the second is about the male protagonist's killing of her and his disturbed life </li></ul><ul><li>lacks the typical Mac Guffin ingredient as the motivations for the protagonists are well introduced and of great importance to the plot</li></ul><ul><li>deals openly with sex topics as transvestism </li></ul><ul><li>has a Christiesque the-detective-presents-the-crime-summing up in the final scene where the psychologist explains to the DA what has happened </li></ul><ul><li>has a number of details from other movies, for instance, Norman Bates was not the innovative character it could have been since Orson Welles already invented the neurotic Motel Host in A Touch of Evil (1958) played by Dennis Weaver. In the same movie Janet Liegh was terrorized in the motel, as well, even making the choice of actress unoriginal. The corpse dumping method by means of putting it in a car trunk was used by Hitchcock in One More Mile to Go (1956).</li></ul>",10,2,4,18 October 2014
Inception," Very Overrated
","I have to give this movie a very low rating because I do find the story ludicrous, and by a mere stretch of fancy: a rip-off of its quintessential predecessor Matrix.I was absolutely astonished how utterly naive the response to Inception was when it was released.Firsty, the story induces the idea of people actually living inside their dreams, when it displays nothing of the surreal effects of real dreaming. Now, I happen to adore a good adaption of dream sequences. The best to date include Polanski's depiction of the crucial scene in Rosemary's Baby where she suddenly shouts: 'This is not a dream! It's really happening!'.Inception is a real charge for technocrats, in my opinion,",1,2,4,15 July 2015
The Sixth Sense," It only works the first time!
","This is my recollection of seeing this movie, and I saw it twice.My girlfriend had decided to study in Spain for Spring Semester 2000, and I didn't like that at all! We decided, however, to go see The Sixth Sense in January, shortly before her leave. It fascinated me by its fresh approach to horror, quite different from the stuff I'd seen before.Unfortunately, the strain of not being together for half a year, save for my visiting her for a month, resulted in breaking up.In July I decided to try various devices in order to cure my heart, and one of them was going to the pictures alone to see The Sixth Sense again that was still running. I thought I'd be scared happy, or something...To my chagrin, the scary scenes didn't scare me at all, as I could anticipate them. On the other hand, I realized that underneath the horror layer was a layer of sadness, of loosing someone dear to you etc. (Remember the scene where Willis tries to grasp the check, and his wife snaps it up and says: 'Happy Anniversary!') This, and all the typical couples in love who surrounded me in the dark of the theater, forced me to make a holy wow never to go to cinema once more without female company!",9,0,1,28 December 2014
