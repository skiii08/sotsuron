Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One Great Movie!!
","The Phantom Menace is awesome!!  While it is easy to debate small points (acting, Jar Jar, etc.)  the movie taken as a whole is just wonderful.  It is not just about a simple trade-dispute or about a couple Jedi's saving a queen, it is about the beginning of the Empire.  It is about betrayal, and significance/insignificance in the universe.  It is a dark tale of irony told through the facade of a happy adventure.  Personally, I think it is the BEST of all the Star Wars movies.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
The Iron Giant," Utterly Fantastic
","I saw this movie at a preview showing today.  The theatre was 75% filled with young kids, and they were completely silent the entire time.  The audience was memerized and so was I.  I had heard this was a great movie, so I was expecting a let-down, but nothing could be further from the truth. The animation is pure 50's Warner Brothers (read: 'The House Of The Future'/Chuck Jones).  It was the best easily the best animated movie I've seen since 'My Neighbor Totoro'.",Null,1,2,1 August 1999
