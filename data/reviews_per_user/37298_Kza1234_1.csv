Marie Antoinette," this movie is awful
","this movie have no story ,no acting,nothing that even resemble to the category of a film. I'm cinematography student and i Lauren nothing from this movie! i regret paying money to see this. for your sack don't go to see this!!!!!!!!! the only thing that is kind of o.k is the lead actress - danst- she is doing what she been told and with out her this movie could have been a lot worse. i sew 'lost in translation' and i didn't like it either but i thought maybe i will like this movie but there is no way i will go and see Sofie Coppola next movie. i was shocked to see this movie got some good review i don't know if the people who wrote it sew the same one i did it was awful.",1,1,6,24 October 2006
