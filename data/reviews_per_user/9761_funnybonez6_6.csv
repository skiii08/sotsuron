Angels & Demons," No Angels or Demons could make me watch it again!
","'Angels and Demons' by Ron Howard is a very bland movie. Tom Hanks is okay as Robert Langdon, but even he can't save a very confusing and uninteresting story and script. The script seems to cater to the dumbest common denominator. You cannot follow the story in an intelligent way, it's too messy and chaotic. I have not read the book, so I assume it's just the movie. It preaches to us that science and religion can coexist happily. That in itself could be an interesting idea, but the way it's done is as if the filmmakers are talking down to us, the audience like we're idiots.Although I've seen a lot worse movies, they probably didn't cost as much to make. The visuals are okay, and there are even some inspired action scenes, but in the end it's all forgettable. By the time you get to the big twist that Camerlengo is the bad guy, you don't believe the film anymore. That's too bad. The best part about the movie is the assassin who is believable and scary person.",3,3,6,30 May 2009
Star Trek," Star Trek made into Star Dreck
","I was a fairly dedicated fan of the 60's TV show (but not really the new series or the previous theatrical movies). However I was pretty disappointed in the envisioning of the new generation's star trek directed by JJ Abrams. The whole movie seems to be no better than a SCI-FI channel movie with bigger special effects.There are too many plot holes to go into. The movie barely held together, nothing really worked well story-wise. The guy who played the young Spock was okay, but that was really the only noteworthy performance in the whole damn thing. Everybody else sucks. There were a couple of slightly decent action scenes, but the fight at the end was surprisingly lame and badly done. It was shockingly bad.There's a cameo by Leonard Nimoy, but absent is the original TV series star, amazing William Shatner. He's nowhere to be found here, to his credit.",2,26,38,6 June 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Wolverine origins: erase memory after movie
","The first five minutes of 'WOLVERINE' gave me some hope that this might be a cut above other action garbage out there. That hope was gone after 20 minutes.To give credit where credit is due, there are a few pretty good action sequences, particularly the fight scenes between Wolverine and Victor Creed (Liev Shreiber surprisingly gives a great performance in this). The scene where Wolverine and Creed team up against Mutant X1 on top of the nuclear power plant was well done also. Another good scene was when the elderly couple helping Logan are killed in the barn.The bad is everything else, like the whole unbelievable plot of the romance with his girlfriend Kayla. And especially bad was how the movie just descends into mindless explosions. The ending was terrible and pointless when Wolverine gets amnesia after the battle. It was frustrating and nearly ruined any good parts. At the end, I wanted Stryker to erase my memory too.",3,2,4,25 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," Salvation Terminated
","'Terminator: Salvation' directed by McG and starring Christian Bale, was a half-way decent movie because of some action scenes. But otherwise this movie was a waste of time. Christian Bale seemed miscast as John Connor. He's a decent actor but he yelled too much. The biggest problem with 'Terminator Salvation' is the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The terminator series can't work well without him, in my opinion. He's sorely missed in this messy very loud movie. A generic robot can't replace Arnold , who defined the franchise. Overall while it wasn't the worst movie to waste 2 hours on, it didn't work up to the level of the Terminator series, not even close. 4/10",4,25,45,6 June 2009
Final Destination 2," Take me to this destination
","FINAL DESTINATION 2 was a pleasant surprise. Needless to say, I had no expectations for a Hollywood sequel to be any good. However, this second installment of FD franchise nearly measured up to the first movie, and is at any rate, a decent follow up.A.J. Cook does a pretty good job as Kimberly, who foresees the awful destruction in a multi-car pile-up. She has just the right mix of attractiveness and believability in the main character. As others have mentioned, the death 'accidents' are fairly inventive (I won't spoil them by listing them) and this was the best surprise in the sequel. Even if the total final movie doesn't come across as anything 'amazing', it's still a very fun watch, and much better than most sequels in every way.",8,2,2,25 August 2009
District 9," Not half bad
","'District 9' was better than I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be another run of the mill Hollywood production. That's not the case. This is a clever package harking back to the sci-fi films of the 1950s. Maybe it's a tribute to those old b movies from the 50's and early 60s? I don't know, but I did find it suspenseful for most of the time.The story is basically about aliens (insect like creatures) discovered in a weird spaceship hovering above Johannesburg South Africa. They are brought down by government forces under the MNU department, and put into a slum of sorts called District 9. They get incorporated into the fringes of society. But when they have to be cleared out of the area, things go haywire when they revolt. Not to bad all in all, basically it had what every good futuristic b movie has, an engaging story. The only issue i had with District 9 was the CGI effects of the 'prawns', which left a lot to be desired. However I looked past that and could still enjoy the movie.",Null,3,7,15 October 2011
