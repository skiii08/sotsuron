The Benchwarmers," Crappy, good comedy.
","I have to admit that comedies starring Rob Schneider, Adam Sandler, Nick Swardson and/or all the others from this group of 'actors' are my guilty pleasure. They're usually so bad I can help myself but enjoy them. The Benchwarmers isn't an exception. These movies usually have a great starting idea (fighting bullies in this case), some good or great jokes and a lot of bad ones and terrible acting. The Benchwarmers adds a few pretty ladies, geek stuff and cool movie cars. Even though I rate these movies around 6/10, this one doesn't deserve more than 5/10 in my opinion. Acting performances are really bad and some of the jokes were a bit more annoying than usual. So there you have it - I like this kind of movies, but Benchwarmers are barely average. Too bad, it could have been much better with just a few small tweaks.",5,0,0,29 August 2016
