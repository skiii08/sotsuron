Requiem for a Dream," Beautiful Work of Art
","This movie is possibly the most well composed, well directed and beautiful movies I have ever seen. The cinematography fits seamlessly with the plot, as does the soundtrack. The soundtrack along with the movie is one of the best ever made, Clint Mansell proved himself to be extremely talented in Pi and his pairing with the Kronos Quartet amplified the dramatic plot of the movie and brought its quality to an unpresedented level. This movie changed my prospective on life, love and happiness, it is so profound because it deals with only its subject matter and doesn't put in any comic relief or such. It should be noted that many people find it extremely difficult to deal with the subject matter and emotional weight of this movie so if you are someone who doesn't have the emotional capacity to deal with the subject matter of this movie.",10,1,2,27 February 2005
