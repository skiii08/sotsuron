Mission: Impossible III," Not So Good
","Well the action scenes are good, but the whole story is not so good. The story is more focus in Ethan's feeling and his relationship with his wife. Not too many conflict between Ethan and his enemy, rather than that his enemy is easily to killed (feel quite disappointed with that). Seems that Maggie and Jonathan in MI3 have special chemistry but it didn't explain and the whole story too focus to 'Tom Cruise'.Tom Cruise not cool at all in this movie but I admit that his acting is good. My point is the story is not so good, the plot seems to ordinary for MI. Hope they can make better sequel (if they will make it) but has to be better than this.",7,2,4,20 May 2006
The Ring," Not so good and lost with the original film from Japan
","The story is take from first and second film by the Ring from Japan. Even the picture is more clear and light, but I'm not feel scare or in tense situation. if The Ring Japan is so scary and made me can't sleep in several days, but this film which Hollywood made were not scary at all, which good it just the face of the victims. Japan made scary because Sadako is not showing her face and she moved from television was like real.HOLLYWOOD IS LOST FROM JAPAN FOR THIS FILM!",6,0,0,8 February 2003
The Transporter," Cool
","Actually I've seen this movie about three times (the third one is today) and I really enjoy it. Enjoyed the fighting scene, the story, the romance, the background musics and the soundtracks, and everything.The story was nice even there was some scene which not make sense, such as: the man was being shoot by laser gun and another weapons but SEE! He wasn't so hurt (a bit nonsense), and he did all the safe things by him self. However, the fighting scene was absolutely good and the most important thing is there was no slow motion (I really don't like when there is a fighting scene and suddenly it has slow motion, looks not real).Too bad Shu Qi couldn't speak English well. Jason Statham is really a cool guy also he has a hot body, and his performance absolutely A+.This movie is good to see! I wish that Hollywood will make another movie like this and I will see The Transporter 2 if the story is as good as the first one.",8,0,0,19 February 2003
The Dark Knight," Too Action
","It's kind of boring to see this movie. 1st 20 minutes of this batman movie focused with Joker's crime scene and I really expect more from batman's point of view. Joker was a real mean jerk surely because Ledger brought the best of himself as a mean joker and his acting is superb. In this batman sequel Bruce Wayne was more mature and stricter himself, nonetheless Christian was look so old and so cold, Bruce's emotion buried within himself. Alfred still the same nice old butler that take good care of Bruce. Rachel found new love with Harvey but at the same time gave Bruce false hope, at the end I felt that Gyllenhaal acted much better as Rachel than Holmes, Holmes acted so emotion less.This Dark Knight sequel is not the best of Batman movies but the whole action scenes were tense and good, what less from this movie is Bruce's personal life may be because in Batman's returns its just too focusing on Bruce's personal life and the producer wanted to tell different story from Batman's life.",7,2,5,13 November 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Not as good as the novel
","I'm a bit disappointed with this film, even I'm exciting because Harry Potter is made in film. Sometime part in the novel is not in the film, end the ending was so simple (not like in the novel). But the film  is good enough to see. And they choose right persons to act in this film. They all good to play their character and must be proud, because they choose right film too to start they're new step to be a little super star (for all who play Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco).And it seems that Draco's name is taken from Count Dracula's name.",7,0,1,1 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Cool movie with good visual effect and complicated story
","First when the movie start I feel boring and think that this movie is just waste my money, but when the fight begun I know that I'm wrong. This movie is cool, just see how Neo fly because he fly so fast. The best part is the fight in the street way with the agents and the twins.
But the part when Neo fight with many agents is a good fight but I don't like the slow motion or the virtual effect which is like the games. I want see real human not human in the game. And Bravo! for them who create the fight, he is so amazing can create soft fight and hard fight.Keanu seems cold in this movie like his other characters in his movies. Every body playing good and must need a lot of time making this movie.Too bad I'm not feel tight at all when see this movie!",9,0,0,18 June 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Action, Comedy, and Romance
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith is really a good movie and worth to be watched. It's absolutely full with funny actions, it's romantic, and it is one of the hot movie in 2005.The story is good and easy to be followed, beside all the actors were playing good. The main couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are really a hot couple. They seem enjoy to act as a couple, and they look perfect to become husband and wive. The way that Angelina and Brad dressed is also good, they look comfortable with what they're wearing.Many funny scenes in the movie and unpredictable scenes also. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the ending, because it's too short and not explaining enough in the other word the ending is not so clear.Bravo! with the Latin song for the ending and when they're dancing in Bogota, Colombia.",9,2,11,9 June 2005
Vanilla Sky," bad movies
","Very bad movies from Tom Cruise. The story is really complicated if you not watched carefully you wouldn't know what the story about. Penelope is can't acting, she not showing enough her expression I'm like see a robot without enough expression from her. Actually Tom is good enough for his act, it just the story is very can not understood for human being. I give 3 for this film score.",Null,0,0,11 October 2002
The Replacements," FUNNY story about team work
","GOOD, FUNNY, AND FRESH story from Mr.Reeves and friends. I really like seeing film about good team work. Beside the story is not boring and the love story is short, that is what make me like this movie.Mr.Reeves can't never played fun, he is actor who good play in serious and romantic films. But not bad can see him dance.This team is from many people from different personality but they have one faith, ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? When world is much with fight, we still can trust someone and we call it with 'FRIEND'.",8,0,1,22 November 2002
Slumdog Millionaire," A Movie that has Moral Points
","Not so expected a moral film about India that had been brought in a real way. I've seen many Bollywood movies but none of that really shown me real life in India not until I watched this movie I realized how poor some people are in India and it lead the children become the most harmful victims.This movie story is like what its title about 'slumdog millionaire' how a poor guy could win a quiz 'who wants to be a millionaire', even though in real life it's hard to believe but this movie tells about hope. The story was happening in most poor countries and this movie was setting it very well, I don't feel bored at all when I watched this film. Good acting for everyone.",8,0,2,27 February 2010
