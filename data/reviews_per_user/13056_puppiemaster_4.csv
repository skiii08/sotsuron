50 First Dates," Barrymore and Sandler
","I loved this film, is was so good I watched it twice and then went home and watched the wedding singer on DVD.Sandler and Barrymore play off each other so well, its not an intellectual film and it will never win any awards but it entertained me from the start to the end.A simple little love story which will make you feel good.",10,0,0,24 February 2004
The Girl Next Door," Next Years Oscars, I Think not
","So this was yet another teen movie, but based on an adult theme,  I for one laughed out loud the whole time, I may have a mind of a 15 year old (I'm 35) so it was a very enjoyable experience.Ok so the acting and the story was not Oscar class, but it took up 112 minutes of my time and filled them very well.Not all movies are supposed to be serious and art, this was just what it set out to be, a good laugh and very entertaining.
I give this film 10/10 for just being so funny, I know its no Shawshank, Godfather, Empire Strikes Back or Matrix, but it really hit my spot",10,6,6,2 May 2004
Knocked Up," Good film for an hour
","I thought this was a very good film, but it ran out of steam after an hour and just stumbled its way to a conclusion, only the gang references were funny in the last 2 minutes after the hour mark. The plot of the film is a looser goes to a club, meets a girl (way out of his league), they have sex and she gets pregnant, they get together and then they fall out, but he reads a few books and they get back together, throw in a few jokes and thats the film.I thought the assemble of characters was good and the acting was OK, it was just the script that ran out of steam. 6/10 By the way who the hell always wears a bra to bed?",6,1,3,9 June 2007
Mamma Mia!," Magical
","I've now been dragged to the cinema 9 times by the wife to see Mamma Mia, obviously I moan about seeing the film yet again and say I want to see The Dark Knight, but every time the film starts I forget about all of that and enjoy every minute of the next hour and 40 minutes, I swear to god that Pierces singing even gets better with every showing.I'm the Grease generation and never thought a musical could ever rival that in my eyes, but I must say I love this film, it flows along nicely, the songs are great and Julie Walters is very funny.This film has also made it easier to decide what to get the wife for Xmas, I just hope the Blu-ray version has a sing-along part.10/10",10,1,4,8 August 2008
