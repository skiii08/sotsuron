Requiem for a Dream," speechless
","I've seen that film last night and it took me a whole while to sleep. First I thought it was just another drug addict junkie film but I was proved wrong very soon. To the end I was only staring at the screen, I couldn't actually believe how cruel this film was, even though the scenes aren't as brutal as in some action films but the whole atmosphere, it makes you feel so odd. I never had this feeling before when I watched a film. The acting was so brilliant, everything seemed so real. The quick changing of the scenes, those tragic destinies of the characters, it is horrible but genius. All 3 main characters were humiliated in a way, not only the gang banging, the doctors in the mental hospital where Sara Goldfrab was made her life unworthy and destroyed the last little bit of life in her and she couldn't do anything against it. Harry who was just another dirty junkie in the eyes of the doctor, got through the horrible pain until he finally got help when it was almost too late.After the film I had to watch something shallow to get the pictures out of my head, I will probably never watch it again but I'm quite glad that I did.",Null,0,1,20 June 2004
