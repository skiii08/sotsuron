The Ring," Awesome horror film!
","This movie rocks! I was scared for days after! Naomi Watts is a great actress, be sure to watch the gagging scene! The little kid is creepy as hell, and there are numerous movie references in the film itself! Samara is just wickedly creepy and spooky!",10,0,0,30 October 2002
