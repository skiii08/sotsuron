The Blair Witch Project," Original but not very exciting
","Saw TBWP on DVD last night. I was a little disappointed after all the hype. First the good points. It's original - definitely not your formulaic, Hollywood fare. Great atmosphere - the music is really frightening and the footage looks authentic. Good acting - from everyone but especially Heather. It's short - 80 minutes. The DVD package is excellent - the movie, director's commentary, various trailers, BW myth, TV documentary. The user interface is also well done (very spooky). BUT... nothing really happens. That may have been OK when no-one knew anything about it but now that some of the story has leaked out (like the fact that it was the producers who spooked the campers) then something was lost. You couldn't help think 'I know who put that stuff there'. So it's a victim of its own success. I gave it 7/10 and it *will* remembered for a long time - but not because it's a classic horror movie - because of its originality. If you want classic horror watch Psycho or Halloween. This movie's not in the same league.",6,0,2,31 October 1999
Blade Runner 2049," Decent but a shadow of the original
","Few sequels match the original. Successful sequels, such as Terminator 2 and Aliens, rarely introduce new ideas. Instead, they build on the original plot - and have good plots themselves. Blade Runner 2049 definitely doesn't introduce any new ideas. New ideas are hard to come up with. A good plot isn't but 2049 doesn't have one. That's the difference between a movie based on a book (Blade Runner) and a movie based on a screenplay (this one). But, in spite of that, I enjoyed this movie. It's at least an hour too long for it's paper-thin story line but it's a sumptuous movie in terms of its cinematography and music. You don't even have to watch it on a huge screen (I didn't) to get drawn into it. I think anyone who enjoyed the original would enjoy this movie. The story line is sparse but, at least, it's serious science fiction and avoids sentimentality and silliness (I'm looking at you Matrix Reloaded). So, not bad. Decent science fiction. Wonderful visuals and music. Weak plot. Wasted opportunity.",6,7,15,8 October 2017
Minority Report," Don't expect BladeRunner
","I was a little disappointed at Minority Report. It had been described as the best SciFi movie since BladeRunner -- but it certainly isn't. In fact, it's actually no more than an above average movie. Bad points - it's unoriginal (you'll find yourself identifying bits from other movies), it's silly in parts (lots of plot holes), it's too long (2½ hours). Good points - it keeps your attention (most of the time), some futuristic ideas are interesting, and... well that's it actually. Tom Cruise is great when he plays 'himself' (a woman-hating egomaniac in Magnolia; a rich brat is Vanilla Sky; Action Man in Mission Impossible) but he's hopeless 'out of character'.This movie - like AI - is way better than the standard movie fare (especially a summer release) but - like AI - it will be quickly forgotten. Spielberg continues to turn interesting ideas into ordinary movies. Now if Ridley Scott had directed this movie... 7/10",7,0,0,5 July 2002
Training Day," Boring evening
","This *sounds* like an interesting movie - rookie cop joins an old (cynical) pro for a day - but don't be fooled - it's just plain silly. Which is a shame because it has some interesting themes (police corruption, ends-justifies-the-means argument etc.) but these are never developed. Instead you get a ridiculous, over the top, shoot-em-up. And some huge holes in the plot. I gave it 3/10 - four points for Denzel Washington's performance (the best thing about this film) and one point off for insulting your intelligence. Avoid.",3,23,47,3 February 2002
Fight Club," Unusual movie - worth watching
","Overlong (2½ hours) but it had something to say. This movie is *not* about fighting! The fight clubs are simply an expression of people's frustrations. The movie is about the shallowness and materialism of contemporary society - the emptiness and pointlessness of existence. It's interesting that it focuses on these feelings within men - not women. The movie has parallels with The Matrix and I think if you like one then you'll like the other. Good movie. I gave it 8/10. The fourth good movie of '99 (after The Matrix, South Park and Sixth Sense).",9,0,1,13 November 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," brilliant!
",The first 30 minutes are the funniest since Airplane.Great movie with something to say about the hypocracy of a society that routinely accepts violence (including wars) but affects outrage at swearing.,8,0,0,6 October 1999
The Mummy," Disappointing movie - not a patch on Indiana Jones
","I was unsure if this film was meant to be a comedy or an action movie. In the event it was neither. The two main characters were awful. The special FX were good and the mummys stole the film! All in all, this is a silly film with bad acting and good special effects, best suited to 10 year old boys. It was also a bit sexist and racist. I gave it 5/10. Go see The Matrix instead.",4,0,1,28 June 1999
Brokeback Mountain," Nothing happens
","I'm not sure that there's much in this movie for the average straight guy. However, other demographics (including straight women) will enjoy it since it is, at heart, a simple love story. And 'simple' is the operative word. The storyline is basic. Nothing happens. It plods along at a majestic pace with a brooding atmosphere - and nothing.Some people have said that the gay aspect of this movie is incidental - that it a love story between two people. But this film would have sunk without trace had it been about a man and a woman.The storyline is the problem. Great movies ('Shawshank Redemption', 'American Beauty' and Ang Lee's own 'The Ice Storm') have great stories to tell. This one doesn't. Unless the fact that there are gay cowboys comes as news to you.But I don't want to be too critical of this movie. I enjoyed it. It's visually beautiful. The acting (especially by the two leads) is fantastic and the direction flawless. But if you put great ingredients into a pot and slow boil them for long enough then you'll end up with mush.",7,6,17,8 January 2006
Cloverfield," Very derivative
","This movie is a mix of several other films, including Blair Witch Project, Godzilla, and Alien. In fact, I found nothing original about it. In spite of it being short (90 minutes), because it's so formulaic, I found it a drag and I was looking at my watch after 45 minutes.And it's a very old formula. Good-looking twenty-somethings run around a city being chased by something evil, make very bad decisions that imperil their safety, escape said peril through ludicrous good fortune... repeat for 60 minutes until end.But the biggest disappointment is the complete lack of plot (beyond the trite: 'I must save my girlfriend from this monster'). Seriously, there is no story here.On the positive side, it is short. And I thought the monster was quite well done. And, I guess, 14 year-old boys will enjoy it.Don't under-estimate the first advantage (the movie's brevity). You'll be very grateful. Believe me.",3,9,39,3 February 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Instantly forgetable eye candy
",I don't know much about the original legend but I hope that it's scarier than this movie. The film is gruesome - but that doesn't make it scary (in the same way that Sixth Sense is scary). The plot is the problem. There isn't much of a story to this film. Just a man on a horse riding around decapitating (lots of) people. I was disappointed by Christine Ricci's performance (I think she's great) since she-read-her-lines-like-she-was-under-rehearsed-and-it-was-all-she-could-manage-to-remember-them-let-alone-put-any-feeling-into-them.But the movie looks great. And it sure is gruesome! It's tongue-in-cheek and quite funny in parts - which can be confusing since you can be left wondering if the film is a horror movie or comedy - it's not a great example of either genre. But it's OK. A good date movie. Instantly forgetable eye candy. I gave it 6/10.,5,1,3,9 January 2000
The Aviator," Interesting but limited
","I enjoyed this movie. And it didn't feel like a three hour film. It moves along quickly, helped by good acting by everyone involved. DiCaprio was particularly good as Howard Hughes. He even aged well.My wife didn't like it as much as I did and I suspect that's because this is a dick-flick (a movie for men!). The movie is at its best when it describes the technical breakthroughs that Hughes pioneered. Even the numerous romances were handled in a fairly brisk. manly fashion.This movie is not a Hughes biography. It covers a small part of his life (the flying bit) and, even then, only part of that (up until 1947). This gives the movie an incomplete feel and leaves you wondering what happened next.But, all in all, it's a good film. Entertaining and well acted. Just don't expect to learn much about Mr Hughes.",7,5,9,9 January 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," There is no movie
","I was hoping that the third Matrix movie was more like the first one and less like the second. In the event, it's like neither. In fact, the Matrix 'trilogy' is not a trilogy - it's really three disjointed films.Make no mistake about Revolutions, it's a shameless exploitation of the original movie. Not one new idea or character has been introduced since the original film. The ideas in Revolutions (and Reloaded) are all plagiarised from The Matrix and the new characters are one dimensional and awful. There's no continuity in any of the films (characters and plot-lines come and go) and the interesting philosophical questions in the first film become ridiculous in the second and third movies.The best I can say for Revolutions is that it's better than Reloaded. If I had never heard of The Matrix and wandered into the theatre off the street then there are bits in Revolutions that were entertaining (some of the action sequences).But the fact is that Reloaded and Revolutions follow one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. And both fail miserably to maintain that standard. Save your time and money and watch the original movie on DVD. Even the 100th viewing beats Revolutions.The Wachowski brothers should be ashamed of themselves. Revolutions dishonours The Matrix.",4,0,0,6 November 2003
American Psycho," Original and interesting movie
",Bateman is a young urban professional (yuppie) who is full of contradictions. He simultaneously adores himself and hates himself. He is surrounded by 'friends' but is utterly alone. He preaches about the poor but kicks a down-and-out to death. He complains about the objectification of women but watches pornography. He enjoys (and analyses the lyrics of) popular love songs while engaging in violent sex. The movie can be viewed at two levels - as a traditional (and often funny) slasher movie or an allegory of contemporary American society.,8,0,1,10 November 2000
Little Miss Sunshine," Above average, funny movie - with a dark side
","Both me and my daughter enjoyed this engaging movie. It's an adult comedy and although the humour is mostly gentle, there are some laugh out-loud moments - with a truly hilarious ending. There is a dark side to this movie - the junkie grandfather and... well, some of the other characters are not what they appear. And that's what makes this movie a little different. The grandfather has some great advice for the teenager in the family (speaking about drugs): 'Stay away from that sh!t. Someone your age is mad to touch it. Someone my age is mad not to.' The acting is uniformly excellent - with the little girl taking the prize. She's wonderful. And the music is good too. My only criticism is that it drags a little in the middle. But the start and (especially) the end, make up for this slight lull. Highly recommended.",8,3,8,8 October 2006
American Beauty," A beautiful movie
","American Beauty is not about one person (Lester Burnham) - it's about everyone. We're all represented in one of the main characters - Lester represents midlife, his wife (Carolyn) represents ambition, his daughter (Jane) represents youth and his neighbours (Ricky and Colonel Fitts) represent wisdom and repression respectively. It's typical of this film that the wise character is a teenage boy (Ricky) rather than a wise old man. It's certainly *not* about a mid-life crisis - that's simply a vehicle to get a few laughs.  Lester's condition is terminal - and not some short-term crisis.The acting is uniformly superb but it's the direction and cinematography that really shine. This film is visually stunning. If there's a weakness it's the storyline. Really great films (like The Shawshank Redemption) have great stories to tell - and this movie doesn't... because the story is known to us all - most people are unhappy. But it's not a glum film. The movie's real message is that we don't have to be unhappy - the world is beautiful - the tagline should have been 'smell the roses'.I like the movie more today than I did last night and I think I'll like it even more when I see it again. The two hours passed in a flash and I will watch it again and queue to buy the DVD when it's released. So it's a great film. But not flawless. I gave it 9 out of 10.I'm not sure if a young audience could relate to this movie since it deals with mature themes (relationships, happiness etc.). But as a middle aged man who works out and has recently taken up smoking, I certainly could. Just as well I never look at my daughter's friends when they visit. ;-)",10,0,0,31 January 2000
Being John Malkovich," Unusual, interesting but also a bit tedious
",I watched this movie on DVD last night. Unusual story and very good acting throughout but a little slow - especially the first half of the movie. The problem is that not a great deal happens in the movie - and some of the interesting strands aren't developed (like the way that everyone kisses Malkovich's ass - but the shallowness of people is skimmed over). But definitely original. Good performances from the main players - and that woman (Catherine Keener) is an absolute stunner! There are better sci-fi movies (The Matrix) and better insights into human nature (American Beauty). I gave it 6/10.,6,1,1,14 May 2000
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Not as good as its IMDb rating
","I guess the high IMDb rating is more a reflection on the dearth of funny films than the actual comedy value of this movie.The movie starts well but the sex jokes go on - and on - and on - and eventually the film runs out of steam. But it's an OK movie - maybe 5 or 6 out of 10 - and definitely one of the funnier films of the last five years.Just don't expect a side-splitting 90 minutes. The humour is very adult so avoid this movie if you are easily offended. But if you're broad-minded and don't expect too much, you will enjoy this short, funny and entertaining film.",6,1,3,26 September 2005
American History X," Not as good as I had hoped
","I was a little disappointed by AHX. I skipped it when it was released at the movies a few months ago and caught up with it last night on DVD. I was right to miss it at the movies. Don't get me wrong - it's OK - infact it's a good attempt at a serious docu-drama by Hollywood - it's just that Europe does this sort of thing much better. And the UK (esp. the BBC and C4) has made much better films on neo-Nazis. The film is also a little sentimental and hard to swallow in parts (the rapid transformation of the brother from normal boy to Nazi back to normal boy again was hard to believe). On the positive side, Edward Norton is excellent and the movie is never boring. Maybe I'm spoiled having seen Norton in 'Fight Club' recently. Now that *was* a great movie...",6,1,3,28 November 1999
Revolutionary Road," Not revolutionary but interesting adult drama
","I'm a fan of Sam Mendes' direction and his style in clear in this movie, which is one of the film's strong point. There are other strengths: the acting is good by just about everyone involved but especially Kate Winslet (who does a much better American accent than the usual grating attempt); the topic is interesting (marriage problems); and the treatment is mature. And there are some genuinely deep moments in the movie that any married couple will relate to. Mendes does suburban angst better than anyone in cinema but his theatrical roots show at times with the staged scenes and clunky dialogue.DiCaprio just can't carry off heavy roles - he looks like a wee boy in a grown-up's suit. The film is based on a Sixties' book and inherits some of the sexism from that era (but not intentionally or ironically). And, at the end of it, it doesn't say a great deal... except that marriage is not the idealised perfection that romantic novels lead you to believe.But for the acting, interesting topic, cinematography, music and atmosphere, it's well worth catching and markedly better than most movies. Watching this movie is time and money well spent.",8,0,1,1 February 2009
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Silly movie for Kung-Fu buffs only
",Reviewing this movie is a bit like reviewing Scooby Doo - you feel a bit silly applying the normal rules of critical review to something so trivial. But Ang Lee didn't set out to make a serious film (the Ice Storm is proof of his talents). So if you want to pass a wet afternoon with your 5 year old son then this movie is fine. I know that foreign language films are usually awful but it's an insult to the genre to claim that this movie is a classic. I gave it 4/10 since it's amusing in parts.,4,0,1,11 February 2001
A Bug's Life," Interesting movie but not was good as Antz
","Nice movie. Great animation. Well up to Disney quality. It reminded me of Toy Story - superb effects but lacking a little in the storyline department. This movie suffered badly in relation to Antz which is a better movie with a stronger storyline. The movies are very similar but Woody Allen and Sharon Stone are much better than their counterparts in Bug's Life. Of course, this doesn't matter if you're 10 years old - my kids loved Bug's Life. Probably more so than Antz. So my advice to anyone under 14 is go see Bug's Life; the rest of us should watch Antz. Two good movies - but only one is a classic.",7,1,1,7 February 1999
The Insider," Too slow, too long, too unimportant.
","There are definitely parallels between this movie and 'All the Presidents Men' and it looked to me like the director was trying to produce an ATPM for the new Millenium. Well he failed. The difference is that ATPM was about the Constitution and this movie is about smoking. So it was hard to get excited about it. Michael Mann tried to use some of the tricks he used in 'Heat' - but it just didn't work since the subject was a bespecaled scientist with a PHd. This is another movie (The Green Mile is another) that is *way* too long. On the positive side, the acting is good - even Al Pacino tried to constrain his over-acting tendencies. But overall - pretty boring, too long - and another reason why American Beauty should sweep the Oscars. One other comment - the film was based on a program made in 1994 yet (small) mobile phones, the Internet and e-mail were seen. Sloppy directing.",5,2,4,10 March 2000
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Excellent love story
","I don't normally like love stories but I enjoyed this film immensely. But it's about love - not romance. To get the most out of this film you will have to have loved - and lost love. In fact, at its heart, this film is a straight-forward love story - stripped of sentimentality and romance. It's certainly *not* a science-fiction film. The science is incidental. Jim Carey is excellent. He plays an unusual character - quiet, deep - and he does it very well. I was a little disappointed when he reverted to type in some later scenes. Don't be put off by some reviewers who (wrongly) think that this movie is about fate. It's absolutely not.If you're in an long-term relationship thats had its ups-and-downs then go see this movie. It might remind you why you fell in love in the first place.Very good. 8/10.",10,0,1,3 May 2004
Avatar," Milestone in movie history
","Avatar was better than I expected. The trailers and previews don't do this movie justice. The real strength of this film is its visuals, which ordinary TVs can't come close to reproducing. The visuals are revolutionary and would make this movie worth watching alone.Its main weakness is the storyline. It's not awful, just pretty standard. There is no chance the screenplay is going to win any prizes. But it's no worse than 75% of movies and better than many, and there are one or two serious messages in the movie, such as the way Capitalism ruthlessly exploits natural resources.If the storyline matched the imagery, this movie would the best film ever. The 3D effects and special effects and imagery in this film are truly amazing. Don't even consider the 2D version.Apart from the plot, there are other weaknesses. The back story (why they chose the main character, who is a paraplegic) is ridiculous (in fact, the whole disabled marine storyline is unnecessary), some of the acting is wooden (Sigourney Weaver looks like she is going through the motions), and it's too long (2½ hours).Apart from the visuals, there are other strengths. The sci-fi is sound (including the concept of an avatar), Pandora (the alien planet) is superbly rendered, some of the acting is good (Zoe Saldana), and the movie doesn't feel like it's 2½ hours long.A milestone in movie history due to the visuals. In spite of this, I gave it 8/10 because of its routine storyline and ordinary acting. But not one to miss.",8,1,5,29 December 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," What can I say? 'Bollocks'?
","The opening scene looked promising. Kidman naked, getting dressed to go out. She looked stunning - except to her husband (Cruise) who didn't notice. Aha I thought, the seeds of the plot are being sown - beautiful wife, taken for granted by her busy husband, the movie will explore their sexuality. But no. It was more 'Hammer meets Emmanuele'. This film is *awful*. Terrible plot, bad acting - even the picture and sound quality were bad. Kubrick must have needed to money. And Cruise and Kidman must have felt like making a dirty film together (not an uncommon thing for married couples to do). Even the sex was bad. I fell asleep during the orgy scene. How could this movie get in the IMDB's Top 250? I gave it 1/10 because Nicole Kidman is beautiful.",1,10,18,11 September 1999
Pulp Fiction," A movie of our times
","Pulp Fiction is a movie of our times - fast moving, exciting but gratuitous and ultimately meaningless. This movie has pace! It moves along from the opening scene at great speed and it's never anything less than thrilling. There are stories within stories throughout the movie. Several funny moments. And many violent scenes. And that's my problem with this film. It seems to glorify (or at least casualise) violence. A kid's face is blown off by mistake - and our heroes only worry that his splattered brains spoils their hair. But it's all very entertaining - just a bit immoral and it doesn't really have anything to say except that Tarrentino has a fascination for meaningless violence. Entertainment value is 9/10. But I gave it 8.",6,0,1,24 November 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Glitch in the Matrix
",You'll be forgiven for a feeling of deja vu when you watch this film. The opening sequence looks like a straight lift from the first movie - and the similarities don't end there. Other scenes (even some dialogue) appear to be lifted from the original film. It's a pity the brothers didn't try to copy the plot of the original movie - because this one doesn't have a plot. It's one chaotic action-scene-followed-by-wordy-dialogue after another. And eventually even the action scenes become boring. The film is too long for the flimsy storyline and there are too many characters to keep track of. My original enthusiasm turned into bewilderment -- which turned into sleep . Major disappointment. 4/10.,4,0,0,3 June 2003
There Will Be Blood," There will be boredom
","If fantastic acting, cinematography and direction made a great movie then this is a great movie. In fact, this movie in perfect in every respect... except the storyline. The story really plods. It's 158 minutes of slow, and not very interesting, storytelling.But, boy, the acting really is something. Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant but so is the rest of the cast. DDL's performance is so good that it commands your attention and conceals the movie's great weakness. You're so mesmerised by him that it's easy to overlook the fact that the storyline is uninteresting. In fact, there isn't a storyline as such. It's just a chronological sequence of events showing how this 'oil man' makes his fortune and uses people along the way. There's no depth (to the story), no great insights.EDIT: Watched it on TV last night and liked it much more. This movie is maybe deeper than it first appears. I changed my vote to 9/10 from 7/10.",9,4,8,24 February 2008
The Green Mile," Big disappointment
",What was this film about? It was *far* too long. One and a half hours would stretch the storyline let alone 3 hours. The first hour basically did nothing. And there were some preposterous moments in it - like the whole mouse business. It felt like the movie was based on an old fable that took 5 minutes to tell - but was stretched to 3 hours in this film. American Beauty will walk away with the Oscars if this movie got a nomination for Best Film.,4,1,4,21 February 2000
Inception," Deception
","It should be called 'Deception'. Or 'James Bond Meets The Matrix'. Take the worst bits of James Bond and the worst bits of The Matrix movies, randomly mix them together, and you have 'Inception'.It's pretentious nonsense from start to finish. The characters are caricatures, the acting is formulaic, and the plot! Jeez. It starts badly and gets worse. By the end, even the director couldn't be bothered and lets it degenerate into a standard James Bond movie (complete with men in snow suits fighting on skis).The age rating (12A in the UK) means the ideal demographic for this movie (8 year-old boys) can't see it. This film is so bad, it creeps into classic-bad-movie territory. Oh, by the way, I 'get it'. I just don't 'like it'. And the movie is not existentialist. It's pointless.I like to say something positive about every movie I see but I am struggling with this one. Oh, I have something: it has a great ending - because it ends.",2,18,45,18 July 2010
Prometheus," Awful
","This movie is very disappointing. Ridley Scott has clearly stopped trying. This movie is absurd. The plot is ridiculous, and riddled with holes that a 10 year old would see through, the acting is like something from stage school, and the dialogue borders on the hilarious (the plot is so bad that much of it is articulated by various characters just so you can follow it). Just about every movie clique is here... the dysfunctional crew, a romance, gratuitous religion, unnecessary gore, etc. After an hour, I gave up on it as a serious movie and started to enjoy it for the farce that it is. I gave it 3/10 for special effects (+1), the 3D (+1), and some of the science fiction (+1). Everything else about this movie is worthless. This movie is the antithesis of Alien, which is a thoughtful, clever, serious piece of science fiction.",3,35,76,3 June 2012
Shrek," Good - but not as good as I'd hoped
","I enjoyed this movie - but not as much as I'd hoped. Don't get me wrong, for an adult it's better than any Disney film but it's just not that funny. That are no great jokes in it and you sort of sit waiting for the really good bits to come - but they don't because there aren't any. It's entertaining enough and it treats the audience with respect (no silly sentimentality) but it's no Antz. I think that the major problem is the plot - it's very weak so all the other good bits in the movie (the attitude, voices, animation etc.) simply make up for the lack of plot. So 6/10.",6,0,0,8 July 2001
Vanilla Sky," A movie with something to say
","This is an unusual and interesting movie - that improves the longer it goes on. I thought that first hour or so was a little slow - but more than made up for by the last 30 minutes. The film is about actions-and-consequences - which makes a change from Hollywood's usual fixation with 'fate'. It has this in common with another Cruise movie - Magnolia - which (among its many themes) was also about choices - and their consequences. This movie is about something important - hang in there and you'll get it. Good acting (even from TC), great music and the two leading women - wow!",8,1,1,4 February 2002
The Sixth Sense," Good movie - great ending (not a spoiler)
","This is certainly one of the top movies of '99. Intelligent plot, good acting and a brilliant ending. The movie is underplayed and can be a little slow at times (especially the first half hour) but that only adds to the sense of realism. It has some genuinely frightening moments. I jumped out of my seat a few times! And what an ending.",8,0,0,7 November 1999
The Matrix," An original movie... for science fiction fans
","The Matrix is a science fiction movie that will mainly be enjoyed by fans of the genre. But if you like serious SF then you'll love The Matrix. The film has two main strands - there's the main storyline which is quite intricate and complex and then there's the action movie-within-a-movie. The plot is intelligent and mostly plausible but quite dense so you have to listen carefully. The action sequences are surprisingly good thanks to superb special effects. Don't be put off by the Kung-Fu comments. Yes, it does have this type of fighting but it's sensible in its context and the effects are *outstanding*. So an intelligent, thought-provoking, thrilling movie - but don't expect your granma' to like it - or your girlfriend unless she's into sci-fi or kung-fu. But for those who are then this is a top movie. I gave it 8/10.",10,0,0,12 June 1999
Moon," Serious sci-fi, serious tedium
","I came away disappointed from this movie. The reviews made it sound a great deal better than it was. Some of the comments about the movie are inexplicable. Good special effects? Some scenes look like they were stitched together from Thunderbird out-takes. The low production costs of the movie are apparent throughout.But good movies don't need good special effects. The trouble is this movie has other failings - such as any sort of pace. It plods along. The middle section, in particular, feels like Purgatory.I wanted to give this movie 6½ out of 10 but gave it 7 because, at its heart, it is a serious science fiction film with something, maybe not very much, to say about humanity and consciousness. Several interesting themes run through it, but most are confusingly presented and none are very well developed.I agree that it's a good first movie and Duncan Jones has potential. It's a pity they don't give you a discount on the price of a ticket because of this.",7,2,5,20 July 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," What's not to like about this enjoyable movie?
","I'm not a fan of TV game shows. So the premise of this movie was not appealing. But the game show is only a backdrop to this movie. It's really a romantic film that has something to say about a few other things such as poverty. The story line is fast-paced and the movie is often funny and sometimes challenging. It tells its story in an entertaining way. So, what's not to like about it?Having said that, it's no classic. I gave it 7/10 because it's... err... a 7/10 movie. Enjoyable, fun to watch, interesting, has something to say... but nothing new and the story line is amusing but not gripping.At the time of writing this movie is #34 in to the top 250 movies on IMDb but don't let that fool you... it will slip down the chart as more people see it. Not because it's bad, because, at the end of the day, it's a slight movie with not a great deal to say that has not already been said.But if you go the movies to be entertained, you will not be disappointed.",7,2,5,15 February 2009
Contact," Intelligent movie not spoiled by dumb romance
","I've watched this movie twice at the cinema and bought the video so I'm a big fan of the film. There are lots of good aspects - the opening sequence is wonderful (on a large screen), the (mostly) intelligent plot, Jodie Foster's performance and best of all the positive, up-beat message that the movie delivers. There's a silly, romantic, religious sub-plot that threatens to spoil the movie but it doesn't and the movie leaves you with a feeling of awe and wonder at the universe and our place in it. Great movie. I gave it 9/10.",9,0,1,4 June 1999
The Social Network," Difficult subject done exceptionally well
","The thought of a movie about Facebook sounded awful. But the movie is, actually, very good. Most movies about computers are terrible and it's a difficult subject to make a movie about. But Fincher manages it. There is a great deal of dialogue in this film so you have to pay attention. If you do, you will be rewarded with some interesting and intelligent dialogue. The acting is good by everyone involved but particularly the lead actor.It's great to see a movie celebrating intelligence. It's as close as you can come to glamorising Computer Science.Some of the other reviews, in my opinion, exaggerate how good this movie is. It's no classic. Just an intelligent, well directed, interesting movie about the cultural phenomenon that is Facebook. But American Beauty it ain't.A smart movie for smart people. Recommended.",8,0,1,31 October 2010
Up in the Air," Enjoyable movie
","My wife and I both enjoyed this movie. It's no classic and, in my view, doesn't merit an 8+ IMDb rating but it is a nice movie and I'm sure that most people will enjoy it.'Nice' maybe isn't the right word since it has a message about how to live your life - and reminds us how awful being fired really is. So it has a serious message -- and it's a pleasure to watch, thanks to excellent performances by all the lead characters. So what's not to like? Well, for one thing, the story is worthy and well-told but don't expect some great movie since the plot isn't up to those expectations. I preferred Michael Clayton, which was a much deeper movie than this one.But you won't be disappointed with this film unless your expectations are too high to begin with. A worthy 7/10. Time and money well spent.",7,1,2,23 January 2010
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Oh brother...
","What a disappointment. I had read so many good reviews of this movie that I was really looking forward to it. But it was a major disappointment. Both me and my daughter fell asleep towards the end. The film had two serious flaws - I couldn't understand the dialogue (due to the strong southern drawl), and (when I could hear what was said) it wasn't funny. Apparently, it was based on 'The Oddysey' by Homer and - like most classic literature - the film was slow, difficult to follow, and boring.",4,3,7,14 April 2001
