First Man," Can't get any better
","Yet another masterpiece by Damien Chazelle. The detailed emotions and awesome cinematography connected me deeply with the story. Didn't noticed the movie was 2 hrs long.I get that some people's review says they find the movie boring and slow. It boils down to one's definition of a perfect film. For me, a series of events can be made into an amazing movie when it is made to feel real and immersive, which is exactly what this movie is. Kudos to Gosling and Foy for reliving their characters.I'll always be on call to watch the next release from Chazelle because I know it'll be good and worth every penny.",10,0,1,23 November 2018
