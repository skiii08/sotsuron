Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Awesome!
","I think this movie will become a classic. Cohen has created something quite unique. The most horrific moments are not Cohen's jokes, which are clearly just that, but the unbelievable stupidity of some of the characters he encounters like the rodeo director. As soon as it ended I wanted to watch it again: this is the highest accolade a film can receive. Questions I did have: Was the prostitute who Borat marries at the end a real actress? Were the village scenes filmed in Kazakstan? And the biggest question... WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMEN AT THE RODEO WHEN SHE FELL OF HER HORSE?! In conclusion this is a very fresh, ambitious project that works on a number of levels and keeps the audience's jaws dropping to the very end.",9,2,9,4 November 2006
