Black Swan," Interwebz Critics Is Funny
","This movie is really quite decent, and the acting is quality. Black Swan is a unique psychological thriller/horror piece about descent into madness, so you get exactly what you should have been expecting.This movie is not about ballet. The critical dance-reviewers of this film remind me of the pretentious weenies who bashed Whiplash because 'it's not true to life, man!' You mean Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, and the others--who are actors and not actually dancers, by the way--didn't perform the way true ballerinas would? Wow! Thanks for your incredible insight!This movie is not a documentary. 'Pffft. Nina would never be selected to dance this role, because the investors would never allow it in the high-dollar world of professional ballet!' Oy. It's a story. Suspension of disbelief, people. Going To The Movies 101.And those who grouse about the actual theme--the potential negative consequences of an insatiable drive to achieve--well, I suspect you've never actually achieved anything of true rare value.The movie isn't 'real' because Nina has no friends? News flash: If you want to be prima ballerina or the next Picasso or Concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra or President of the United States or any other position of prestige, then you have no life outside of striving for the unattainable perfection required to achieve that goal.There are no friends. There are no video games. There is no gardening, or reading for pleasure, or dating, or Saturday afternoon relaxing at Starbucks. In fact, there is no watching of movies like Black Swan. There is only rehearsal and improving your craft. And that life can destroy pretty much anyone. Which is the entire point of this film. Too bad you missed it.",7,0,0,26 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Dispelling the Nonsense
","Yes, this movie is not great. But it is also not terrible. What is terrible are all the lies being stated in the reviews. So, to correct the record...Emperor Palpatine is not 'suddenly' alive again. He has been alive for decades, and in multiple forms. Did you know he had himself cloned? Of course you don't. You don't know this because the only things you know about Star Wars are the things you saw in the movies. There is a lot more to Star Wars than the films. Try reading a book sometime.Yes, Palpatine had children. No, that doesn't mean he was ever a nice guy who 'felt and demonstrated love.' Why are you presuming Rey's parent was born of a loving marriage? Ever heard of rape? 'When did Palpatine have time to raise a child?' You think all parents are attentive to their children and raise them personally and with care? Which planet are you living on? You mean Palpatine was a super-evil Sith Lord who only created children to further his own agenda? Wow, insightful!And Rey's parent wasn't Palpatine's only child. Anakin was his child, as well, but you don't know that because you never bothered to learn about Star Wars.Why are you surprised that Rey and Ben can force-heal? This is not a new skill. Palpatine's master Darth Plagueis could keep others from dying and also manipulate the midichlorians to create life (the skill Palpatine used to create Anakin). They even explained this in Episode III, so you've had 15 years to get your head around it.Rey is not a 'Mary Sue.' And it has nothing to do with two lightsabers versus one. Rey is the most powerful force-user in history because she was bred to be that very thing. If Lebron James and Venus Williams had a daughter, would you call her a 'Mary Sue' when she kicked your ass at probably every sport conceived by man?Leia was not 'suddenly' trained as a Jedi. Again, read a damned book.Yes, Rey is a Palpatine. And she adopts the name Skywalker at the end because that is the path she has chosen. That's who she is. Life is about choice, not lineage. Pretty simple.'Disney greed' has not somehow destroyed a once noble franchise. George Lucas made some movies. He didn't make them to preach the Gospel or 'because art.' He made them to get paid. Do you think he would have fought so hard to retain merchandising rights if it was only about his 'vision?' Don't conflate the use of the Hero's Journey with some altruistic motive.",7,4,23,4 May 2020
Salt," Russians are terrible
","Dated a gal from Georgia (the country, not the state) for a while. She confirms that Russians are jerks. Plus, they oppressed all of Eastern Europe for decades.This movie is a lot more fun than you would think. The 'plot holes' other reviewers cite result from their inability to think. Every action Salt takes is logical and demonstrates continuity.",7,0,0,10 May 2020
