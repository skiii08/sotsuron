The King's Speech," Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush deserve Oscars
","At first glance, this movie may not seem like much to write home about. Stripped to its essentials, its the story of a man with a stammer and his struggle to overcome it. It says volumes for the makers of this film that they take this simple plot and create a shining masterpiece! King George VI was a strong, courageous voice to the British people during World War II and Lionel Logue deserves a special footnote in history for he is the one who made that voice possible. This film has such a wonderful message about how one person can overcome adversity and another seemingly ordinary person can make an extraordinary difference in helping him overcome it. Firth is magnificent in his facial expressions and vocal mannerisms. You really believe he does have a stammer and so many times you want to help him seeing his anguish and frustration. His acting is first rate, watch the scene where he tells Logue of his abusive and lonely childhood or the scene where he breaks down realizing the horrible burden he is about to inherit. Rush is wonderful as well and I love the way that the king and the commoner become friends in the end. This movie lover gives two thumbs up, way up for this truly brilliant 'speech'.",Null,2,4,19 January 2011
Men in Black 3," chocolate milk and time travel
","The original Men In Black was one of the few sci-fi movies I ever liked and it was because of the great chemistry and camaraderie between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Fifteen years later, they still have it! I never saw the first sequel so I cannot compare but this is a great movie. Tommy Lee Jones has been a favorite of mine ever since I saw The Fugitive. I think he could walk on the moon without a spacesuit. Some people who have co starred with him have said he is not a joy to work with but he is a joy to watch. He is hilarious as Agent K. He is so deadpan and wooden he makes Jack Webb look overemotional! It is a perfect contrast to Smith's persona. This film was a little confusing because of the great shifts in time but its a lot of fun all the way as J travels back to 1969 to prevent his friend from being killed and the earth from being destroyed. I also wanted to mention that Smith and Josh Brolin (who has the bigger part as younger K) have great chemistry as well. Brolin has the mannerisms and speech patterns down so well it is almost spooky. SPOILER ALERT in 'junk' movies like this you don't expect a lot of emotional moments, but there is in the end where young K kills the alien but not before the alien kills the officer that let them into the launch pad. It turns out the man was J's father and young Jay is right there to be comforted by the young K who erases the horrible sight from his memory (confusing right?) It is a wonderful way to end the movie",Null,0,5,30 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Watson as he should be portrayed
","This may shock a lot of people but I actually liked Watson in this movie better then I liked Holmes. Jude Law does an awesome job and I think that he captured Watson the way that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wanted him to be portrayed. Most people think of Nigel Bruce as Watson from the early Holmes films with Basil Rathbone. He was portrayed simply as a bumbling old fool, the comic relief. Doctor Watson was portrayed in the stories as a loyal friend, a skilled doctor and a brave man in a crisis. Robert Downey's interpretation of Holmes may offend some purists but it passed muster with me (one small quibble, Holmes always has to wear at least one disguise in his movies and in this case I thought he made an ugly woman!). I don't think that I have ever seen a Holmes movie where he kicked as much ass as he does in this one, its like Rambo is playing Sherlock Holmes. We don't get to see Holmes really utilize his intellectual gifts until almost the end of the movie. SPOILER ALERT This movie follows Doyle's original story The Final Problem where Holmes and Moriarty fight at the waterfall and both apparently fall to their death.",Null,3,5,26 December 2011
Ali," a knockout
","To say that director Michael Mann and Will Smith had a formidible task making this film is a true understatement. How can you make a biographical film that would do justice to one of the most recognized figures of this century? (In a poll, more people knew Ali then knew the US President). I saw this film just last night and I think they pulled it off with flying colors. This is the best film biography since Coal Miner's Daughter. Will Smith actually trained for a year and put on over 30 pounds to play Ali, he did all of his own fighting as well. He is awesome. He captures Ali's colorful personality, humor and bravado. The fight scenes are wonderful and you feel like you are watching the real thing, especially the fight with George Foreman at the end. The only thing is that this film only covered certain parts of Ali's life. It told nothing of his early years, his Olympic victories, his early fights, his fights with Ken Norton and the Thrilla in Manilla with Joe Friazer. I also think they should have covered his later years as well (well Ali's life since boxing has been so tragic maybe it would have been too sad). All in all this is a great film from the man who directed Thief and Manhunter. I also wanted to mention Jon Voight's wonderful performance as the mouth that bored Howard Cosell. I used to watch him cover ABC boxing and Voight gives a wonderfully hammy performance.",Null,0,1,26 December 2001
The Hangover," a total waste
","For the life of me, I do not know why this pathetic excuse for a film even made a million let alone becoming one of the biggest hits of the year. This is the first movie I have ever seen that I have walked out of, I left with a little less then a half hour to go. You don't have to eat a whole apple to know that its a rotten one, a good analogy for this pathetic film. It does not have anything resembling intelligence, humor or style. These three guys are so stupid and unlikeable that you don't give a damn about them or if they find their friend. That is the first rule for liking a film, you have to care about the characters. There was a friend who saw this film who said it was junk and told me to stay away from it and boy I wish I had listened. This movie is an insult to the intelligence of every intelligent moviegoer.",Null,10,22,23 July 2009
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," So thats why Abe was so good with an ax!
","I have always loved history and Abraham Lincoln was always one of my heroes. Gee I didn't realize that he was this bad ass dude that went around whacking vampires! Shows you how little I know. Seriously, I like movies that try to cover new ground and be original and creative and the people that made this one really take the cake in that department, make that the whole bakery. I enjoyed the fact that they skillfully mix an original story with the known facts of Lincoln's life. For example, Lincoln did live in a place called Pigeon Creek when he was a boy; his mother did die when he was very young; he did work as a shopkeeper and have a friend named Joshua Speed and he had a young son named Willie that died in the White House. Like so many other horror movies, my complaint with this one is that it has so much gratuitous blood, guts and gore. What more then makes up for that, however, is a young actor named Benjamin Walker. He does an A+ job of bringing the 16th President to live. He convincingly shows Lincoln's humanity, courage and compassion and does as fine a job as any other actor who has played Lincoln in a serious movie. Critics usually don't give a lot of credence to horror films and the actors in them and thats a shame because in any other type of movie, Walker would be getting major headlines. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives him able support as his wife Mary. She is portrayed as very loving, devoted and strong and that is wonderful because Mary Lincoln usually takes a character beating as a neurotic witch. The Civil War battle scenes in the movie are as realistic as any war between the states movie only its the vampires against the blue coats and the silverware wins (watch it and see). SPOILER I love how they end the movie with a little bit of irony. After Lincoln defeats the vampires, he and Mary decide to relax and celebrate, by going to the theater.",Null,1,2,22 June 2012
Meet the Parents," four stars!
","This is one of the few films that i ever went back and saw twice. It is that good. I remember that the editor of my hometown paper even praised this film in his column. I don't think that I have ever laughed so hard at a movie in my life. You just watch the film and you have such a wonderful time that you just never want it to end. Robert De Niro is one of the great actors of our generation and he is hilarious in this film. I think this is the first comedy I have ever seen him in and this man is a natural. He is wonderful because you can see that his character is basically a good and decent man who is just a little overprotective of his daughter. Ben Affleck is also wonderful, he brings a sort of awkward, charming boyishness to his role as Greg Focker. You can sense his insecurities and you really feel for this guy as he tries to make a good impression, but just keeps screwing up! I feel that the best performance of this film belongs to the great Blythe Danner as De Niro's wife. She should have at least gotten an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. She is truly someone who has never gotten the credit that she deserves (she is best known as Gwenyth Paltrow's mom) but she is a great actress in her own right. Check out her work in The Great Santini and The Prince Of Tides.",Null,0,1,13 October 2001
Citizen Kane," a great film
","Its hard to believe that Orson Welles was only 25 or 26 when he wrote, directed and starred in Citizen Kane. It is also hard to believe that this film was not a box office hit when it was first released (Its A Wonderful Life wasn't either). I saw this film in a college class I took on movie making and thought it was wonderful. Time has not 'dated' it at all. Its still as wonderful today as when it was first released. The opening is the best when they have that 'news on the march' that details Kanes death and tumultuous life. Welles based Kane on William Randolph Hearst and his powerful newspapers did everything they could to stop it from being released. It was only with the passage of time that people realized how great it is. I for one loved the symbolism of 'Rosebud'. People say that it was only the name on his toy sled but it was more then that. Kane had achieved great wealth and power but died a bitter, lonely unhappy old man. All his wealth couldn't buy him happiness. In his last moments, he was thinking back to the simple joys of his childhood. In a sense that toy sled tossed into the fire was Kane's Paradise Lost. Orson made a bad mistake, he directed the greatest film of his career at the very beginning of his career and basically had no where to go but down. The Magnificent Ambersons, Journey Into Fear, The Stranger, The Lady From Shanghai, MacBeth, Othello, Mister Arkadian, Touch Of Evil, The Trial, Chimes At Midnight. Welles could never top Citizen Kane.",Null,2,4,24 August 2003
Public Enemies," A first class shoot 'em up!
","Someone once said that Johnny Depp never met a weird part he didn't like. He has done so well at playing oddballs like Edward Scissorhands, the cross dressing director Ed Wood and even Willie Wonka. Its so nice to know that he can play a normal part well as he sure does in this film. Michael Mann is one of the most brilliant directors of our time, he has directed such classics as Thief, Manhunter and Heat. He triumphs once again in this brilliant film that runs circles around any other shoot em up. It is 1934 and the FBI declares war on public enemy #1 John Dillinger. They pointed out in the 'goofs' section of the IMDb entry on this film that Mann carelessly made many errors with history. For example, the movie opens with Pretty Boy Floyd being killed by FBI agents. Floyd actually wasn't killed until several months after Dillinger (he took Dillinger's place as Public Enemy #1). They have Baby Face Nelson doing a Jimmy Cagney impression from Angels With Dirty Faces which wasn't made until 1938! However, this is such a fine film these are just minor quibbles. Depp gives a fine performance and makes John D. out as a lovable rogue. Yes he is a bank robber, but you sort of root for him. For example, there's a scene where he tells a bank customer during a robbery not to give him his money that he just wants the banks and another where he is tenderly polite to a lady he took hostage. I wouldn't be surprised if Depp gets an Oscar nod for his work. I hope Mann gets one as best director for it is long overdue. The only trouble I have with this film is Christian Bail as Melvin Purvis. I wanted Purvis to be played just as charismatically as they played Dillinger. After all your supposed to be rooting for him. Simply put, Depp acts circles around Bail. This man is just so bland and boring its almost as if he is sleepwalking thru his part.",Null,9,16,3 July 2009
Ed Wood," first rate all the way!!!
","It is really ironic to me that one of the best film biographies should have been made about a man who people consider the worst movie director of all time. Ed Wood was a transvestite (ironically he was a very decorated Marine in WWII who fought wearing a bra and panties underneath his uniform, he said one of his worst fears was being wounded in combat and having the medics cut off his clothes and revealing his secret). Wood was a good and decent man and this is well shown in this film when he befriends Bela Lugosi. Lugosi was one of the biggest Hollywood horror stars when he made Dracula in 1931, however he made a horrible mistake when he turned down the role of Frankenstein that Boris Karloff took. This part made Karloff a star and he was able to enjoy a bountiful career. He was able to play other parts that proved he was a fine actor when he wasn't playing a monster. However, Lugosi was typecast for the rest of his life and never approached Karloff's success. Maybe that is why he didn't like him. There is a funny scene in this film where Martin Landau as Lugosi goes off on a profane tirade about Boris Karloff. Johnny Depp and Sarah Jessica Parker and Bill Murray all give wonderful performances in this film, but it is Mister Martin Landau who makes it for me. He simply IS Bela Lugosi. This is the finest screen performance of a real life person since George C. Scott played Patton. It is almost like Landau stepped out of his own mortal soul and became Lugosi. I think one of the reasons he did such a wonderful job is that there is a connection between him and Bela. Maybe I should explain, Landau was thrown aside by Hollywood for so many years after he did Mission Impossible. He had to do garbadge like The Harlem Globetrotters On Gilligan's Island (I kid you not that was one of his roles!) Lugosi had to do trash like that as well. One of his films was called Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla. Landau was able to make a comeback with films like Tucker: The Man And His Dream. He was able to make the comeback Bela could not. In fact when he won the Oscar, one of the things he said was 'Bela wherever you are thanks'. The thing about this film that really got me is that Ed Wood was somewhat noble. He was a person who loved filmaking and was as genuinely dedicated to his craft as any great director like Orson Welles, William Wyler or John Frankenheimer, he just wasn't any good at it!",Null,0,0,25 October 2003
Orphan," As good as I thought it would be
","This film has been advertised to death and in this case there is truth in advertising. It is a good, first class thriller with genuine scares that also proves Hollywood scriptwriters can come up with a unique twist and they surely do in this film, if it weren't for the IMDb message board it would have been a shock to me but I learned what it was months before the film was released. I was also surprised that this movie isn't as graphically violent as a lot of the others that I have seen this year. This shows that the filmmakers knew what they were doing in creating a real thriller instead of a cheap slasher. I also wanted to mention that I am tired of people harping on the fact that this film deals with an adopted child. I didn't find that theme offensive at all. Its only a movie people. Leave your social conscience at the front door of the theater and just have a good time. The killer-kiddie theme has been played before in The Bad Seed (a classic) and The Good Son (not so good). Unlike MacAuley Culkin, Isabelle Fuhrman really can act. She is a true acting prodigy for one so young and I think she has a promising future. She really does a good job at playing a Jekyll-Hyde part. When we first meet Esther she seems so charming and intelligent you wish all kids were like that. That makes her true evil nature all the more chilling. They point out in the film that sociopathic killers can seem very charming on the surface. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard (I didn't make up these names) also do a fine job as the unsuspecting parents. Kate and John have both undergone the tragedy of losing a baby (Kate has a horrible nightmare about it in the opening that really will shock you) These two decent people decide to adopt but boy do they make the wrong choice. The noted character actress CCH Pounder plays the nun in charge of the orphanage who arranges for Esther's adoption. She is best known for her role on The Shield. I just feel sorry for the 'Pounding' the poor sister takes in the end. It is at this point in my review that I wanted to take my hat off to Farmiga who by far does the best acting job in the film, this very fine young actress really makes you feel this woman's goodness, her grief, her personal demons and her fear that there is something wrong with Esther. The character I have a problem with is Sarsgaard's. I know that in these killer kid films the adults have to be oblivious, but he is as dumb as two rocks in a bucket! All the evidence is right in front of him but he just doesn't listen. SPOILER ALERTS MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS you've been warned watch out! Don't read any further if you want to see the film. I read an early script adaptation someone sent me and they did make changes in the ending and I thought they were for the better. First of all, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) lives! Let me repeat Daniel lives, I want to assure all of you of that the way Charles Dickens assured A Christmas Carol readers that Tiny Tim lived. Jimmy Bennett does a good job of playing the middle child who immediately senses Esther isn't what she seems. I felt so bad in that scene where Esther held a box cutter to his...ahem and made him wet his pants. Also the twist about Esther is really original it may be the most original plot twist this year. She is really a murderous 32 year old with a dwarfism disorder who only looks like a child. I feel bad for Kate that she loses John but at least her two kids are still alive. Also the final showdown between Kate and Esther in the house and at the frozen lake is terrific, suspenseful and chilling. Its like Alfred Hitchcock could have directed it. If your going to see one thriller make it Orphan.",Null,10,17,24 July 2009
Yes Man," a little of Jim Carrey goes a long way
","I feel really ashamed of myself for going to see this film and wish I could have my money and the two wasted hours back. What was I thinking. It just amazes me that one could get so far on so little talent as Jim Carrey. I enjoyed Ace Ventura, The Mask and Dumb And Dumber, but his act wears thin and gets old very quickly. People have made him out to be a comic genius but this just isn't the case. He breaks no new ground here and there really isn't a lot of laughs. The young actress who plays his love interest does a fine job but they don't have real chemistry. Its like she just cannot wait for the take to be over just to get away from him. I also wanted to mention Patrick Laborteaux's part in this film. He was on Little House On The Prarie as a kid and was Bud on JAG (one of my favorite shows, he and Karri Turner were so wonderful together). Karri Turner has had only two bit parts in films since JAG was canceled and Patrick Laborteaux only has a 40 second spot in this film. What a letdown. To go from being on one of television's most beloved shows to bit parts. How sad. Anyway the bottom line to my review is to avoid this movie like the plague. I think a great way to sum it up is simply 'Say no to Yes Man'.",Null,0,2,29 December 2008
Dear John," Excellent film just hard to watch
","Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried both give excellent performances in this film. I can tell that they are definitely two young actors with a bright future. I am a Sergeant in the Army and could immediately identify with John. He is a fine young man who wants to serve his country. This film opens in the spring of 2001, when he is on leave surfing and falls in love with Savannah, a young, idealistic college student. We see their whirlwind romance and how they pack a lifetime of joy, laughter and love into only two short weeks. He promises to come back for her when his term of enlistment is up, then America's darkest day happens and it changes everything including their promising relationship. The scriptwriter for this film is a real wizard with words especially in the touching letters the two exchange. I think that the most heart wrenching scene in the film is where he burns all her lovely letters after getting the 'Dear John' one. This film eventually goes to 2007 when the two meet again after several years. He has been injured in combat and she has married the man we saw earlier who had the autistic son. SPOILER ALERT, I was so glad that before John's father died that he finally learned to connect with him. His father was probably autistic as well but he truly loved his son. SECOND SPOILER ALERT, John sells his father's coin collection to buy Savannah's terminally ill husband more time and that was such a noble sacrifice. The way this movie ended sort of reminded me of Sleepless In Seattle because you wonder what ultimately happened to these two people you have come to care so much about, did they finally have a happy life together as they deserved? I wanted it spelled out in the end that these two were married and lived happily ever after. John and Savannah, now older and more mature, meet in 2007 in a coffee shop after her husband has died. Earlier, the dying man said he wanted John to care for his autistic son. When they embrace, you just hope for the best. This movie is excellently acted by all involved but I wanted to especially mention the actor playing John's dad. It also has a sweet, touching musical score and a great screenplay. However, this is a movie I only want to see once in my lifetime because it is so downbeat. As a Soldier myself, I have seen what war and prolonged separations can do to even those truly in love.",Null,2,5,19 February 2010
The Expendables," Hail, hail the gangs all here
","Watching this movie was a great experience for an 80's movie buff like me. Its like the advertisement for it says, it has everyone! It says a lot for Sylvester Stallone's toughness that he can still play a tough guy part when he is one year from collecting Social Security. It really tickled me seeing the cameos by Bruce Willis and 'The Governator'. Its sort of an inside joke, he and Stallone have always had a friendly rivalry. Mickey Rourke really steals the show in his few scenes as a former mercenary turned tattoo artist. He delivers a rambling speech at one point about losing your soul that is really oddly moving in a way. Director Stallone has the camera dwell on his battered features as he delivers it. The awesome special effects, loud explosions and familiar faces sort of blur the fact that the plot from this movie could have easily been an old A Team episode. There really isn't much of one. But who am I to quibble? This movie is a great way to round out the summer.",Null,9,20,16 August 2010
Full Metal Jacket," The best war film ever!
","The late Stanley Kubrick was one of our most daring and ingenious filmakers. Doctor Strangelove was probably his most well known film with that scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb.  In 1957, Kubrick directed his first film Paths Of Glory with Kirk Douglas and it has since been hailed as a brilliant work. In my humble opinion, I feel Full Metal Jacket is his most brilliant work. I first saw this film in 1987 and have seen it countless times since. I guess as a career soldier, I have a special insight into its messages (it is one of the most popular films among service people).  I don't think there has ever been a film about the Vietnam war that was better.  In terms of realism and the depiction of war's horror and madness, FMJ is the best.  In a sense, we are really treated to two great films in one.  The first part is the most realistic depiction of military training I have ever seen. Many people dont realize that Lee Ermey had actually been a drill instructor at Parris Island and he is terrific as the brutal, sewer mouthed Sergeant.  I have to admit that I also found his performance hilarious in some parts! Vincent D'Onofrio is also brilliant as the slow-witted recruit pushed to the brink of madness. Not to be a spoiler, but the final scene in the bathroom between him and Ermey is chilling and haunting and unforgettable, I will never forget the expression of madness on his face.  The second part during Vietnam is also very well done, Kubrick makes effective use of darkness and slow motion especially during the sniper attack scene.  A really haunting masterpiece from  a great director.",Null,0,0,1 October 2001
Salt," Salt is one 'peppery' heroine
","The people who wrote this film apparently don't think the audience is very smart. They want us to believe that Angelina Jolie who is about five foot four in her bare feet and 100 pounds wringing wet is capable of beating up and shooting about sixty people, crawling around a ten story building on a narrow ledge, jumping from tractor trailer to tractor trailer and climbing down a ten story elevator shaft! Boy she is one tough, ass kicking mama! Some people have said this movie is merely a clone of the Jason Bourne movies (one reviewer waggishly called Salt Jason Bourne with a vagina). However, Jolie makes her role distinctly unique. She holds this movie together with cool intensity that would rival any actor. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow but there is enough action for five movies, so just sit back and enjoy the ride. By the way, for you history lovers, there really was a theory that Lee Harvey Oswald had a Soviet lookalike who was the real killer of JFK and there really is an underground bunker below the White House.",Null,184,328,7 August 2010
Bad Teacher," I even love her as a bad girl
","Cameron Diaz is my favorite actress and I think the most beautiful one I have ever seen. I have been smitten with her ever since I saw Charlie's Angels. She has played different roles, and always excelled, but I don't think I've ever seen her play a bad girl before. I assume that she had a ball making this film because she really gets to play one here! I remember my favorite high school teacher was Mrs. Martin, whom I'd English with, in one of her classes we read Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. In the film, Diaz has her students read it as well and I thought my dear former teacher would have had a conniption if she could have seen the character she plays. Elizabeth Halsey is the teach from hell. There is literally nothing redeeming about her. She is foul-mouthed, an alcoholic and druggie, selfish, shallow, vain and is concerned more with her bosoms then in inspiring her students (all they do in her class is watch movies). Even when she changes and starts really teaching them, its only for a selfish reason. However, our girl Cameron still makes this a movie worth watching. You don't root for her character but she still makes this film even if she puts the 'anti' in anti-heroine. I guess Cameron could play the devil himself and I would still pay the price of admission so maybe I'm biased. I did want to mention another scene stealing performance in the movie. A young English actress with the wonderful name Lucy Punch steals the show as 'Mrs. Squirrel'. Even with as bad a teacher as this, I still give this movie an 'A'.",Null,5,10,24 June 2011
Tropic Thunder," Well done Mister Stiller
","I had the pleasure of seeing this fine film today and wanted to set my observations down while they are still fresh. This film has been getting a little bit of 'flack' for not being politically correct. Actually I find a lack of PC in a film quite refreshing. Yes some are offended by Robert Downey Jr. playing a black man and by the hilarious conversation he and Stiller have about playing a retarded person in a film. My advice is simply leave your brain and conscience at the cinema door and just relax and have a good time. Stiller has been a favorite of mine ever since I saw meet the parents. He has this goofy, everyman quality about him that is perversely appealing. He is wonderful at comedy and I would like to see him do drama. He has had a bit of a turn-down in his career recently and I hope this gets it back for him because he does an awesome job in this film as actor and a very fine director as well. This film is really sort of a satire on hypocrisy. The actors playing macho soldiers who cannot do without their cocaine and cell phones, the so called hero who was a cook in the Coast Guard etc. I also wanted to give kudos to both Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black. Jack Black has also been a favorite of mine since I saw Saving Silverman. He is talented at both comedy and drama, just look at the great job he did in Shallow Hal. Downey is a true Hollywood comeback story. I am so happy he conquered his personal demons and found its best to get 'high' in your work. Oh heck, everyone here does such a great job that its hard to tell who steals the show from who. Oh and last but not least lets not forget Tom Cruises hilarious cameo as a foul mouthed studio executive. All in all this is a great film and I give it four stars and two big thumbs up.",Null,1,5,6 September 2008
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Hold onto your seats
","With his Scientology preaching and couch jumping antics, its hard to take Tom Cruise seriously isn't it? He has just coasted so long on his pretty boy looks. As far as I'm concerned he hasn't really earned his paycheck since A Few Good Men, thats the last time he really 'acted' as far as I'm concerned. However, who am I to quibble. Fans of Mission Impossible don't pay to see Ethan Hunt and his agents do Shakespeare or Tennessee Williams, they pay to see lots of action and we get it in spades here! This movie would have been a lot more effective if they had made it during the Cold War since it involves an attack on the Kremlin. There is a lot of action to keep you on the edge of your seat especially the one where Hunt Spidermans down the side of the world's tallest building. People with fear of heights should not watch this movie. Jane Patton does a wonderful job as a ballsy female agent with a score to settle.",Null,3,8,26 December 2011
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," uneven, hard to follow but still a lot of fun
","I remember reading James Thurber's story when I was a freshman in high school. I have to admit that Ben Stiller takes this beloved literary classic and gives it an amazing new twist. Stiller is an excellent choice to play Mitty. I have long been an admirer of his and I feel that he is like a modern day Jimmy Stewart. He has a wonderful, down to earth 'everyman' quality that all of us can identify with. In his movies he is always the lovable underdog who seems so insignificant and yet in the end is the hero. All of us who have slipped on a banana peel and embarresed ourselves can identify with this wonderful thespian. What is remarkable is that as a director Stiller only gives a nod to Mitty's heroic fantasies, they flash very briefly. He dreams of saving a building full of people from a gas explosion and beating up his pain in the ass boss (who HASN'T daydreamed of that). However, in his effort to save his job and find a missing frame of film, Mitty turns real life adventurer (in the beginning he couldn't think of one 'remarkable' thing he ever did in his life) We see him skateboarding through a volcanic explosion, surviving a plunge into a shark infested ocean and climbing the highest mountain in the most freezing cold. I love movies that try to be original and Stiller certainly dares to do that and it pays off wonderfully I just kept wondering what in the hell was on that Frame 25. Stiller's transformation from Marvin Milquetoast to Indiana Jones may not be the least bit convincing, or even make very little sense, but what the hell! Your entertaining us Mister Stiller and that's all that matters. Kristin Wiig, a wonderful comic actress and Saturday Night Live cast member, is really sweet as Mitty's fantasy love interest. SPOILER ALERT, after Mitty saves the day in the end and has the last word on the boss he hated, it shows he and Wiig together at last. I had that sense of disappointment I had in the end of Sleepless in Seattle, because I wanted to know if there was a happy end for both of them.",Null,2,5,26 December 2013
Kick-Ass," Very original
","I have sometimes thought that Hollywood has run out of ideas and its screenwriters lack originality. This movie is a change of pace for sure, because it is original. They say that even that unlikeliest person can become a hero and Aaron Johnson's character Dave (Kick Ass) is sure a case in point. He's a loser who has a girl that likes him only because she thinks he's gay and pities him. He lives in a world of comic book fantasy and decides to become a superhero like one of his make believe idols. This despite the fact that he has no super powers whatsoever. You admire this kid's good hearted nature but can't help but laugh as he gets the crap beat out of him! Nicholas Cage's character says it to him best, your name should be ass kick. Cage gives a delightfully quirky, eccentric performance as big daddy in this film. He would have been the last actor I would have picked to play a superhero but he steals the show as does young Chloe Moretz as his daughter and fellow crime fighter Hit Girl. She's so lucky to have him for a father, my goodness he shoots her in the chest twice while she's wearing a bulletproof vest to toughen her up. If all parents were so caring. My goodness, little Chloe must have had a ball making this film. She gets to curse like a sailor and kill over thirty bad guys with knives and guns to the theme music of the old Bannana Splits show. This movie has enough gunfights and explosions in it for three movies. I would have loved to have seen their special effects budget. Kick Ass is sort of like Spiderman directed by Quentin Tarentino.",Null,2,11,19 April 2010
Gran Torino," a fine swan song for a living legend
","Ever since I saw Dirty Harry on TV when I was 10, I have always been a Clint Eastwood buff. I have seen all of his films at least twice. I am probably one of the last people to see this film in its theatrical release. I put off seeing it for two months and I think the reason was I read Eastwood said it is his last film. I thought it would be a depressing experience, after all who wants to hear the last word on Clint Eastwood. However, this film is first class and I think its wonderful that Mister Eastwood has gone out on top. In his first acting role since Million Dollar Baby in 2004, Clint shines as Walt, a man out of step with his times. He has just buried his wife and they make it clear at the beginning he has no relationship with his children or grandchildren. A Korean war vet and retired auto worker, he has an Archie Bunker view of the world and the 'gooks' who live in his neighborhood. However, circumstances occur that make him examine his prejudices and in the end redeem his troubled soul. Next to In The Line Of Fire, I consider this Clint's best acting job. He makes you dislike Walt's prejudices but still feel for the man. He has a great scene where he angrily tells that troubled young kid about the horrors of his war and the guilt of killing and how it troubles you all your life. Eastwood is so great at playing characters that are tormented by demons of guilt. He has done it so well before in Unforgiven, In The Line Of Fire, and Million Dollar Baby. It says so much for Eastwood's toughness that he can still play a tough guy role and still fight with fist or gun at an age when most people are trying to remember what they had for breakfast. I also wanted to mention he does an excellent job directing this fine film as well. Eastwood is so low key that most moviegoers don't realize he heads his own production company, Malpaso productions, and directs most of his own films. He has won two Oscars and even critics who have derided his acting have praised him as an outstanding director. SPOILER Alert, this movie and The Beguiled are the only Eastwood films where his character isn't around at the end. However, we cheer Walt at the end because he shuffles off this mortal coil heroically and with a purpose, like a man and with perfect dignity. We rejoice for him, because we know that he has at last found the redemption and peace he so craved. Well done Mister Eastwood and enjoy your retirement.",Null,1,5,17 March 2009
The Hurt Locker," One of the best war films ever made!
","I'm a career Army Sergeant who will retire in three years. I usually get a big laugh when I watch movies about the military because they get it all wrong. I watch and say to myself 'it isn't like that in real life, these filmmakers don't know what they're doing'. I saw The Hurt Locker tonight at my base theater and want to salute a great filmmaker named Kathryn Bigalow and I sing her praises with fervor. She should join the ranks of Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket), Oliver Stone (Platoon) and Francis Ford Coppola (Apocolypse Now) as a director who made one of the greatest war films ever. I have never seen a film that so realistically captured the horror of combat and the endless hell Soldiers in combat experience. Sergeant James and his fellow Soldiers aren't Rambo or Sergeant Stryker. They are just human beings who want to stay alive and go home. You feel their fear and smell their sweat, Bigalow makes it that real. I served in Operation Desert Storm as a young National Guardsman and this film brought back memories and had me on the edge of my seat more then once. This film has won excellent reviews and raves from audiences and there is truth in advertising. I am so glad I made the decision to see it. I had never heard of any of the actors in the film, but they all do outstanding work. The only thing is that Sergeant James attitude at first got on my nerves. I was thinking that I wouldn't feel safe with him in combat. He grew on me though. SPOILER ALERT I felt so sorry for that young Specialist that had his leg shot up in the end. He had every right to chew out Sergeant James. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT. Sergeant James couldn't save that man rigged with the bomb in the end and I know that hurt him, but he made it home to his wife and child and then decided to go back to Iraq? What was he thinking. No happy ending here. Well like they said in Platoon, innocence is the real casualty of war.",Null,2,5,11 September 2009
Grudge Match," Two aging lions who can still let out a mighty roar
","On paper the premise for this movie would seem too ridiculous for words, a 73 year old man boxing a 67 year old man (Stallone and DeNiro's ages). However, I have to give the makers of this film just credit because they take this seemingly insane idea and make it work. So many people have commented that it was appropriate for Stallone and DeNiro to work together on a film like this. DeNiro won an Oscar for playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull and Stallone played our most beloved movie boxer Rocky Balboa. Maybe they should have made this film back in the 1970s when both of them were in their primes! Stallone is basically playing Rocky in this film, a decent, honorable blue collar guy who is too proud to reveal he is blind in one eye. He and DeNiro are so funny to watch in their constant bickering, especially that part where they tear the studio apart in that computer simulation. I hadn't seen Kim Basinger for a while, but she still looks awesome and is really wonderful as the love interest of the two men (she is sort of the 'Adrian' of the film). There are parts of this film that are sort of affectionate homages to Rocky. There is a scene where Stallone drinks a glass of cracked eggs and another where he is about to punch a side of beef but then his trainer tells him that is unsanitary and he only wants dinner (Alan Arkin has an amusing bit here as Stallone's geriatric foul mouthed trainer, he is supposed to be like Mick in the Rocky films). I really found myself rooting for Stallone's character because DeNiro, while doing his usual brilliant acting job, basically plays a horses ass! I didn't like that part where he endangers his young grandson I don't know how his son was so forgiving towards him. My other beef with the film is that training sequences that show the two elderly gents suffering the agonies of the damned seemed very forced (however I have to admit I thought the scene where DeNiro farted while doing sit-ups was very funny). Then ladies and gentleman we come to the conclusion, the great fight between these two old warriors. Will they remember to take their Geritol? It may be hard to believe, but the final fight is very exciting and realistic and like the bouts in Rocky. SPOILER ALERT Sly gets to win (duh doesn't he ALWAYS get to win) We see that the two men have laid their personal demons to rest and now have mutual respect for one another. Oh and by the way, sniff sniff, DeNiro hugs his estranged son and tells his grandson to call him 'grandpa'. What a happy ending. I have heard that this film is really getting slammed by the critics and I want to come to its defense. I also wanted to mention that you should stay for the closing credits because they have one last laugh in store for you. They try to get Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson to have a rematch!",Null,2,6,28 December 2013
Million Dollar Baby," What a movie!
","I have always been a big fan of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and a director. He is so modest and low key that people don't realize he directs the majority of his own films. I hope he retires because this is a wonderful swan song to a brilliant career. I felt like crying at the end of the film. Eastwood will be 75 in May and he looks every year of it, Morgan Freeman also looks terrible, but that suits them perfectly in the roles they are playing. In 1992, Eastwood and Freeman made movie magic in Unforgiven and lightning DOES strike twice in the same place here. Hillary Swank gives a knockout (no pun intended) performance as a woman who has nothing but a dream. Her youthful enthusiasm mixes perfectly with her trainers weary cynicism. Boxing is a seamy and brutal sport that this film captures perfectly, all the pain, hurt and dreams that never came true. The boxing scenes are a delight to watch. You have to wonder how many hours Swank actually trained to get all the moves down. It sort of reminded me of Rocky. However, in these movie fight scenes they throw more punches then in dozens of real fights! A boxer would be dead! SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Swank finally became champ in the end, only to have everything taken from her in the cruelest manner imaginable and forcing her trainer to make an unspeakable decision. Forget about the debate on mercy killing, it is just heart breaking to watch because Swank and Eastwood's characters were really like father and daughter in the end. Its all the more moving when it shows his wretched relationship with his own daughter and Swank's money grubbing, ungrateful white-trash family (I was hoping Clint would punch out that punk brother of hers). I think the movie would have been better off if Swank had just won the title and there had been a traditional 'happy' ending. By the way, this is the only film where I have seen Eastwood weep on screen. He does it at the end when he unplugs her life support and gives her the injection. It is just gut wrenching. You just hope that Swank's character is wearing the crown of everlasting life instead of the championship belt.",Null,9,14,8 February 2005
Paranormal Activity," a little film that packs a big punch
","Watching this film, I was sort of reminded of The Blair Witch Project or Open Water. Movies like this show that you don't need a big budget, big stars or grand special effects to make a quality film. This film was made two years ago and has just two main actors. It clocks in at 85 minutes and doesn't even have a soundtrack or credits and yet it is the film everyone is talking about. I liked the fact that unlike so many horror films it doesn't use gory special effects. I have always loved ghost stories and watching this made me think of my Boy Scout days telling stories around the campfire. SPOILER ALERT, this film is slow to get started but once it gets scary watch out. The last scene of this film made me feel like I had swallowed an ice cube whole. Ahhh! you'll be scared.",Null,0,1,28 October 2009
The Dark Knight," Ledgers good, but he's no Jack
","I don't think I have ever seen a movie that has gotten as much hype as this one. I don't think even the 1989 Batman got as much publicity. Too much pre-hype can really hurt a film, I give Snakes On A Plane as an example. I saw it today and wanted to set down my observations. Yes it is a good film with a lot of action. I grew up watching the Adam West Batman, light hearted and campy. The title of this movie is accurate, they do make him as a dark night who has almost as much inner torments and demons as the villains he pursues! He has just not let the darkness overwhelm him. Like everyone else, I was saddened by Heath Ledger's tragic death and I think that might be one of the reasons for the raves about his performance, people see it with their hearts instead of their heads. The truth of the matter is that yes he does give a good turn as the Joker. He brought his considerable talent to the role and truly made it his own. However, he did not for one moment make me forget Jack Nicholson! That was one part Jack was born to play and Ledger was real gutsy to even try, but he didn't come close. Ledger was good but there is only one Jack Nicholson and he is the best. Sorry Heath, have fun in Heaven though.",Null,11,22,19 July 2008
Drag Me to Hell," lots of scares
","I just saw this film today and wanted to set down my views while they are still fresh in my mind. This is the third horror film I have seen this year after The Last House On The Left and The Haunting In Conneticut and I think its the best. It has gotten some of the best user ratings on IMDb and some have said that it may go down as a cult classic. Sam Raimi has achieved fame in recent years by directing the very popular 'Spiderman' franchise, however he started his career directing horror films and returns to his roots so to speak in this one. In fact, a little bit of nostalgia here, they use the old Universal logo from the 1980's before the film starts. Right away the title Drag Me To Hell slaps you in the face. I had never heard of Alison Lohman, but she is definitely a young actress with promise. She plays Christine Brown, a young bank loan officer bucking for a promotion from her boss, played by the noted actor David Paymer, an old Gypsy woman comes to her asking for an extension on her mortgage. To show her boss she has guts, she denies it and the old woman puts a Gypsy curse on her. She will be tormented by an evil spirit for three days and then dragged to hell to burn for all eternity. Boy and I thought I had a bad day at work! I have only seen two other horror movies that really scared me, The Night Of The Living Dead and Pet Semetary and I also add this one. I had genuine chills at various parts of the film. Lorna Raver is chilling as the old Gypsy woman who torments Christine. They really put on the gross makeup. She needed serious dental work! She has got to be the ugliest actress I have ever seen since Anne Ramsey in Throw Mama From the Train. She is one actress that you can say didn't make it because of her looks. The special effects are really awesome especially in the seance scene. I felt like I was on Disneyworld's Haunted Mansion Ride. Raimi uses humor in this film as well. I liked the scene where Christine has a nosebleed from hell all over her boss and the scene where the goat is talking in the seance! I only have two complaints with this film. Raimi goes overboard with gross special effects, like the scene where Christine has a vision of the old Gypsy woman vomiting blood and maggots on her face or where she sees an eye and fly eggs in her cake. Alfred Hitchcock rarely used gory special effects in his films. He was really the master of horror and suspense because he realized that grossness doesn't make a great film. Raimi should have taken note of this. This film could have been just as effective without being gross. Also, I have a problem with the ending SPOILER ALERT MAJOR SPOILER WATCH OUT. Lohman did a very fine job of making Christine seem so real to me. She was basically a decent person. She was a simple farm girl who was a vegetarian who loved animals. She even admitted in the end that it was selfish and wrong of her to deny that old woman. She admitted it was just so she would get a promotion. I sort of knew how this film would end about twenty minutes before the final credits. It all has to do with that envelope. The final scene where she falls off the platform and is dragged into hell forever made me feel like I'd swallowed an ice cream cone whole.",Null,1,4,7 June 2009
The Hurricane," basically a work of fiction
","I need to warn people who watch this film, even though Denzel is a great actor who always gives a fine performance, to say the least this film needs to be taken with a grain of salt because its basically biased fiction with extensive 'dramatic license'. I have done some research and there are some facts you need to be aware of. First of all, Carter had an extensive criminal record, he was 29 years old when arrested for the Lafayette murders and had spent 11 of those years in confinement of some sort! The film shows him as a child rescuing a friend from a child molester and then stabbing him in self defense! Wrong! Carter actually beat a defenseless man over the head and stole his watch. He was always getting in trouble for fighting and beating up people, that was why he was sent to juvenile hall. He escaped in 1954 and spent two years in the Army (he was dismissed for unfitness after four court martials). He then went to jail for four years for assaulting and robbing three people. This film makes it look like he was pursued by a Javeat-like, bigoted detective named Della Pesca who 'set him up' for the murders. There was no such person. Vincent De Simone was the real detective assigned to the case. According to all accounts he was a very nice man and an outstanding police officer who was not a racist or had anything against Carter. Also, contrary to what this film would have you believe, Carter was not unfairly robbed when he lost a decision when he fought for the title. Carter himself admitted this in an interview. Bob Dylans song The Hurricane said 'they put him in a prison cell but he could have been the champion of the world'. Carter lost eight of his last fifteen fights and wasn't even rated when he was arrested. In a 1964 Saturday Evening Post article Carter talked about going up to Watts and shooting cops (I could get about four or five). He owned an extensive gun collection and was feared by the people in Paterson. Is it any wonder he was considered a suspect! Like I said, this is a good film, but its just not true.",Null,36,66,2 October 2001
Jaws," duh...duh...duh....duuuuuuu..dduuuuuuuu
","John Williams score was one of the spookiest sounds that I have ever heard. No wonder that this movie cleared the beaches when it came out in the summer of 1975. Steven Spielburg has directed so many fine films, but this is his finest. He knew how to make a first class thriller just like Alfred Hitchcock did. Spielburg did such a wonderful job with Jaws because when you think about it, you didn't really see that much blood and gore and you did not see the shark until almost the end of the film. Steve shied away from using bloody special effects the way that so many directors of these cheap slasher films do today and I think that made it a better movie. He just used things like the spooky music to make you hide your eyes in fright in anticipation of what might happen. This is one of the few films that is better then the book. Roy Schider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfus make a dynamite trio. They do such a wonderful job that it is hard to tell who steals the show from who. When you think about it, they have to carry the last half of the movie all by themselves and they do it so well. I read that Shaw and Dreyfus didn't like each other during the filming, but that made it even better. I do not know if people realize this, but that speech about the USS Indianapolis that Quint makes is based on fact. There really was such a ship and Robert Shaw (who was an accomplished writer and playwright) insisted on writing this himself. He should have gotten an Oscar for this amazing soliloquy who gives. The USS Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser that delivered the uranium for the atomic bomb to the island of Tinian. On the way back, it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. There were 1,196 men on the ship, based on the accounts survivors gave after they were rescued, it is estimated as many as 400 may have gone down with it. The men were in the water for five days before they were finally rescued! By some sort of SNAFU, no one reported the ship as missing and they were found only by accident. After all that time, only 316 came out alive and about 100 of the casualties had been eaten by sharks.",Null,0,1,14 August 2003
The Wrestler," Mickey Rourke finally gets it right
","Mickey Rourke is certainly one of the most glaring cases of squandered talent in Hollywood history. Back in 1982, he costarred in the cult classic Diner and critics hailed him as a new James Dean, however in the 27 years since, he has been more known for his irresponsible bad boy behavior and his abortive attempt to become a boxer then for his movie credits. He had an amazing talent to turn down good roles like in Beverly Hills Cop and The Untouchables and take bad ones like Harley Davidson And The Marlboro Man. However, he finally made a wise choice in accepting this role. He won over a dozen major awards for his portrayal of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and to me he earned them all. This is certainly a dark sad film in the classic 'film noir' sense. There literally isn't a happy moment in it. Randy The Ram was once on the top of the wrestling world, the Muhammad Ali of wrestling. Now it is twenty years since his last great match and he is living in a run down trailer park and wrestling before tiny audiences at the bottom of tank town. He tries and fails to form a relationship with his estranged daughter. There is a heartbreaking scene where he gets drunk and misses dinner with her and she throws him out for good telling him its broken beyond repair with him. You look at this sad shell of a man and you realize what he means when he says that the ring is what he loves because its the world outside that really hurts him. Marisa Tomei is also great in this film as the stripper with a heart of gold he flirts with. You can sense her character's pain as well as she tries to balance being a loving mother with her sleazy profession. Tomei was wonderful in My Cousin Vinny and brought home Oscar gold, but her career never took off like it should. I am glad she won praise for this as well. Rourke's greatest moment in the end is the speech he makes to the audience before the rematch when he tells them how he may be down but isn't out! Its a speech that would have made Sylvester Stallone proud. SPOILER ALERT its insinuated that he is having a fatal heart attack in the match and the last shot is of him leaping off the rope. I felt that it would be the only appropriate end for the Ram to die in the ring. He didn't have a happy life but at least could have a happy death. A sad ending for a brilliant but sad film.",Null,0,0,21 July 2009
Dark Shadows," Unique to say the least
","My last review on IMDb was of The Lucky One and I said it was one of the corniest, clichéd by the numbers movies I ever saw. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp may not be to everyone's taste as actor and director but at least they are always unique and original in everything that they do. They have made so many movies together that I bet they can read each other's minds. I never saw the original Dark Shadows series (although I think I remember seeing a Barnabas Collins board game in my fifth grade classroom). I can't compare Depp's performance to Jonathan Frid the original Barnabas, but Depp really delivers I think. He makes Barnabas scary (the scene where he kills those construction workers, those hippies and that doctor) however he also makes him strangely sympathetic as well. You feel sorry for him in a way because of the terrible curse he bears. Burton brings his trademark quirky brilliance to directing this film. He does a fine job mixing laughs and screams. However, there was just one slight at the end. I always watch the credits of the movies I go to see and I noticed that they didn't dedicate it to Jonathan Frid who just passed away. He'd a cameo in the film as well as three other original cast members.",Null,1,7,14 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes," An interesting interpretation by Downey
","Robert Downey does the very difficult in this film, he brings a fresh new interpretation to one of the most famous roles of all that literally hundreds of actors have played. He breathes new life into Sherlock Holmes, this being the first Holmes theatrical film in 21 years. He brings a grittier, seedier take on the role (there is one scene where Watson nags him over his poor personal hygiene!). This is one of the few Holmes films where you will see him fighting with his fists as well as with his wits. The thought that I had watching this very entertaining film is that I hope they make a sequel (SPOILER ALERT, they leave the door open in the end). In addition to lauding Robert Downey, I also wanted to praise Jude Law for being a fine Doctor Watson. In the Basil Rathbone films, Nigel Bruce played Watson as a doddering old fool and I thought that was making Arthur Conan Doyle turn in his grave. Law plays Watson as he should be played. Watson is no bumbling, fool, in Doyle's stories he was a skilled doctor and a brave steady man in a crisis. In fact, the script plays Watson as Holmes equal in every way! There is even a scene where he saves Holme's life. The plot is intriguing, the special effects and action are magnificent but in the end its Downey and Law who make this film worth your time.",Null,0,0,11 February 2010
Halloween," great film
","I think Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of this film because when I saw it, it reminded me of his movies. What I didn't like is the fact that this film had such a sorry legacy, what I mean is that there were several sequels and to put it bluntly each one just got dumber and dumber. These films also inspired a lot of other mad slasher films showing women as the victims of psychopathic killers. I remember that Siskel and Ebert even did a show on Sneak Previews on this distrubing trend. Roger Ebert put it best when he said that this film didn't hate women it loved film! John Carpenter is a great director who knew how to make a true chiller. When you think about it, Halloween really doesn't have a lot of blood and gore in it. Carpenter created suspense and chills using things like shadows and scary music. He was masterful! So often today, filmakers just plop a plate of gore in front of us and call it a movie. Jamie Lee Curtis made her debut in this film and she is awesome, truly one of our great actresses. What I like is the fact that she has the guts to fight back against the killer and that she is not just another token victim. Donald Pleasance is wonderful as the psychiatrist determined to stop the madman. An interesting footnote, in one of his other films The Great Escape he played a WWII POW. In real life he actually served in World War II and was a POW for real!",Null,0,0,14 October 2001
RED," He still has it!
","Its been 22 years since Die Hard launched Bruce Willis' career. He has had a roller coaster of ups and downs since then. I consider his movie Cop Out, which came out earlier this year, as a major down! Here he is back on top in this very exciting and enjoyable thriller. He plays a burnt out former CIA agent who is so bored with retirement that he conducts a long distance phone romance with a government secretary (Mary Louise Parker in a delightful, show stealing performance). I really felt bad for Bruce's character. He was the best the CIA had and yet his character just yearned for love and a simpler life. John Malkovich should get a 'ham of the year award' for his performance as Willis' crazed CIA buddy. I love the part when he blows that woman away after she calls him 'old man'. The always great Morgan Freeman is also on hand and brings his usual dignity and class to his role, my only complaint is that he didn't have enough screen time. I also enjoyed Helen Mirran's performance as well. She is best known for Shakespeare and classic roles. I assume that she had a ball making this film. She is hilarious.",Null,2,4,18 October 2010
Easy A," stuck on stupid kids
","First of all, I wanted to say that Emma Stone does a terrific job in this film as Olive. Whether she is being sarcastic or slutty she is just awesome. She is one young actress with a lot of promise (I hope she doesn't end up like Lindsey Lohan). Someone else compared her to Molly Ringwald in the John Hughes movies in fact they mention John Hughes in this film. Watching this film made me think back to my high school days when I read The Scarlet Letter in English class. They reference it heavily here and Emma is supposed to be like Hester Prynne in the novel. The only thing is that Hester didn't seek to be branded as a trollop, Olive wanted to be one in the worst way. I just don't understand because she seemed like a smart kid in the beginning. Was she that desperate for attention? High school has changed so much since my day, but one thing stays the same, some high school kids are stuck on stupid. Teenagers will like this film because as in most teen films they play the adults as total dolts. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson absolutely steal the show as Olive's goofy parents. There is one hilarious scene where Olive's mother tells her about her high school exploits with both boys and girls. Your watching this and thinking no wonder Olive is so troubled. Malcolm McDowell has an amusing cameo as an autocratic principal and I thought the ones that play Olive's cliché spouting teacher and his adultress wife were a hoot as well.

She finds out she is going to be deported to Canada unless she marries and she blackmails Reynolds into it. He whisks her away to Alaska to meet his loving but eccentric family (Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenbergen are great as his parents and the wonderful Betty White steals the show as his kooky grandma. Betty is still going strong at 86 and may she have at least fourteen more birthdays). There is a great scene where Bullocks opens up about being so jealous of Reynolds because he has a wonderful family and she has been on her own since she was sixteen. This is a wonderful film that entertains, warms your heart and really makes you think. What more could you ask from a movie? Two big thumbs up.",Null,1,4,28 June 2009
Valkyrie," Tom Cruise out to get Hitler!
","I like this movie very much, even though for the life of me I cannot spell the title. Tom Cruise got far on his good looks, but he proves here that he is a fine actor as well. This is his finest acting since A Few Good Men. I never thought I would say this about a Nazi but Von Stauffenburg was a very brave and heroic man and had his plot suceeded, he would have been REVERED as the man who killed Hitler and ended the war. This movie has excellent performances all around (even though the lack of German accents does get confusing). The greatest compliment I can pay the filmmakers is that even though I knew how it was going to turn out, my stomach was still in knots as the plot unfolded. SPOILER ALERT, the only reason why Hitler wasn't killed is that an SS Officer kicked Von Stauffenbur's briefcase bomb under the table and a heavy oak table support deflected part of the blast from Hitler. Anyway, this is a good first class thriller about brave men who saw true evil and decided to do something about it.",Null,6,13,29 December 2008
The Soloist," Downey and Foxx make a great team
","There was a statistic they showed at the end of the film that shocked me. It pointed out that there are 90,000 homeless in Los Angeles on any given day. This film is a searing indictment of the shameful way we treat both the mentally ill and the homeless. Jamie Foxx is riveting in his portrayal of a schizophrenic with a talent for music. His character reminded me of the one in that movie A Beautiful Mind. We see the hellish torment this poor man lives with every day. Its almost like he's trapped in a prison with no way out. Robert Downey Jr. was so funny in last year's Tropic Thunder, he proves here that he is good at doing drama as well. He is wonderful as a weary, sardonic reporter who in a way finds personal redemption when he decides to do a story on this poor homeless man with a genius for music.

Before that, this is a movie you can practically smell from your seat. Its a smell of sweat, stale cigarette smoke, cheap booze and utter despair. Except for Wahlberg and his girlfriend, I really didn't like a single character in this movie. I was angry at Wahlbergs character a little for the way he let his stupid, trashy family rule him and the way the enabled and covered up for that loser brother of his. This is a man who knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard and then let his personal demons bring him down about as low as possible. I think the most pathetic scene in the film was where his brother thought HBO was doing a documentary on his 'comeback' when they were really doing a documentary on how he had messed up his life. I can tell that Wahlberg really worked out for the fight scenes but they are not as good as Rocky, basically he just gets the stuffing beat out of him before landing one lucky punch.

","I went to this film really wanting to like it. I thought it would be a sort of 'Death Wish' remake. Charles Bronson's character lost his family like Gerard Butler's character did, but he only killed criminals. Even though Butler's character suffered a terrible loss, you cannot feel sorry for him because he killed innocent people and in the end was no better then the men who murdered his wife and daughter. Jamie Foxx is a fine actor and I lauded his performance in The Soloist earlier this year, but he should have passed on this film. This movie seems to have a preoccupation with graphic violence. SPOILER Alert, that scene with the Judge and the cell phone and where Foxx's lovely assistant gets cooked in her car were very disturbing and one of the reasons that I did not like this film. The only good thing about Law Abiding Citizen is that it does raise serious questions about our legal system and how justice often fails.",Null,3,8,16 October 2009
