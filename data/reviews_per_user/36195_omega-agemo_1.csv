","I think we are ready to expose our selves to this kind of situation. I appreciate the openness of the story, specially how the director forces us to face the nature of men. I got angry, I got furious during this movie but, I also enjoyed the performance of the characters. I could say many things about how this movie became a piece of totally joy to me . But I conclude that..... until we accept that tragedy is a component of our lives............. we'll always be repressed. Anyway is not worth to get so philosophical. Clint has became a very interesting film maker. I hope that we get more of him.Larga Vida a CLINT EASTWOOD",9,3,5,8 August 2009
