Raiders of the Lost Ark," THIS MOVIE IS KICKASS
","This movie kicks-ass All right I've said it, it's out of my system.First off let me say that this is the best action movie to date. I am a girl and let me say it is not a guy's movie. The comedy and parody of old 30's serials is wonderful. Also there is the best female action character (Marion played by Karen Allen) in the last ten years. I loved this movie to pieces and have seen it a thousand times (probably more) I just hope they re-release it in 2001 for the 20 year anniversary. Anyway, this movie has everything, comedy, romance, action. I also want to say it has one of my favorite love scenes. (when Indy and Marion are on the boat) I absolutely adored it. (not to mention Harrison Ford is one of the best looking males to date)",10,0,0,28 October 1998
Armageddon," MAJORLY KICKA**!!!!!!
","All right. I loved this movie. It was awesome and totally cool. Not to mention I (and I suspect everyone else, everyone I talked to has) cried my eyes out in this movie. I loved Ben Affleck. This is, yet again, another totally awesome performance by him. It was much better than Deep Impact, at least in this one stuff blows up. It may not be some big deep, life affirming movie, but as the cliche says, 'I laughed, and I cried.'",Null,0,1,17 March 1999
