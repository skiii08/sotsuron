Captain Phillips," Beyond Expectation
","I watched this movie without going through the cast in the movie (which is usually done before watching any movie.)All I knew was, this was something about Somali pirates hijacking a Ship. I was doubtful about depth of the story narration and the movie.When I saw Tom Hanks in first scene, I was convinced that there is something about the movie. The very opening scene depicted travel details and the Captain so well that I got impressed by the Direction.Paul Greengrass is an excellent director.Tom Hanks is one of the all-time-best-actor and he proved it again. Especially in the end scene he looks so natural yet intense.And Somali actors, especially Barkhad Abdi and Barkhad Abdirahman showed absolutely remarkable acting. Ever scene is packed with thrill. You will never feel to skip even a frame.I will consider this is as one of the best movie I have ever watched.",8,1,3,18 July 2014
Black Book," Wao! what a movie!
","Honestly, I did not expected the movie be so good.Thought it is just another military and spy story.Looking at the ratings, thought to give a try and glad that I came across this movie.The never ending unfortunate story of Jews is very well narrated.All actors act carried out their role very well.Carice van Houten is one of the finest actor around.Sebastian Koch is elegant as always.Movie keeps you glued to the seat.One of the movie to watch",8,0,1,5 August 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Good for Trailer, but where is the real movie ?
","I had always been admirer of 'The Lord of the Rings' and watched and enjoyed all three of them many times.But The Hobbit series had been disappointing. 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' was not up to the mark set by 'The Lord of the Rings'.I was expecting 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' to be better.But this movie failed to impress again.Soul of any movie is story line, but it is missing.It looks like the movie is created by by combining leftover shots of The Lord Of The Rings.Most of the scenes are stereotype, does not keep the audience interested.I know it takes a lot of effort and dedication to create these kind of movies, but for me as a viewer, it did not impress me as expected.",5,3,4,17 July 2014
