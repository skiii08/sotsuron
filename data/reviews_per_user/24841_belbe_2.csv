Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," a little more brains and it would be perfect
","OK, solving the mystery before half way through is really NOT my idea of a sherlock Holmes movie! he's supposed to outsmart us all so I really like the shrill of not knowing what's going on until the very end. It also makes no sense that all that a woman who outsmarted Holmes TWICE be tricked so easily by Moriarty whom Holmes is eventually able to outsmart as well. One could say she did it not cos she was so smart but because of her feminine charms but that would hold true for anyone but Holmes, that's just not who he is. A person with a perceptiveness of a high autistic person can't possibly shut it off over a skirt's as**.The brilliantly put lines from the last one were also missing, like say 'it's a question of professional integrity! what woman would want to marry a doctor who can't even tell id a man is dead or not'.well, In the end, I can't say I didn't like the movie. I laughed my ass off and everything else was as good or better than I expected! Downey is always a delight to watch no matter what crap he's playing, but it's quite sad that they left the brains out of the movie.",9,2,3,28 January 2012
Blade Runner," my favorite movie ever
","I'm only not awarding a 10 because, even though it's impossible to create the same idea without it, I can't bring myself to hear a character's thoughts... narrators just freak me out... that's just me.However, what is most intriguing to me is that this movie has always been my favorite ever since i saw it for the first time when I wasn't 10 yet. Why is this? I've no idea. I'm pretty sure I couldn't grasp the depth of it then! Truth is, 3 or 4 years later I found the book Blade Runner 2 in a fair and devoured it! And that was when I really started to get the point. A short time later I heard a replay was due on TV and I was sooooo thrilled! I could barely remember the movie and there I was, happy as a baby boy with a new toy ferrari! I loved the melancholy, the chilly atmosphere, the creepiness of that very down-to-earth future prospect. The contrast of the feverish will to stay alive of the replicants to everything else... I really can't begin to describe all that drew me to the movie. Another 10 years or more and I saw the movie again, grasping even more of it's content. And i still love it. However, some of the magic is gone, because now I can understand it all.So no, you don't have to be a thinking viewer to appreciate this movie. you simply have to be alive.",9,1,2,4 November 2008
