Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," hands down the funniest movie of the year
","this was the most profane, most hilarious movie I've EVER seen! i was at this film festival where i sat a row in front of the director and during some parts i just HAD to look behind me to see his face because i couldn't believe what was going on on the screen. and the best part of it was that its all real! which just makes it better. they broke so many laws and Mr. Charles said that they actually had a security team to guard their camera men and Sacha from cops and other security men during some shots. and there's so much x-rated stuff in it (i.e. the nude straight male wrestling match in the hotel) etc etc. not to mention the scene with Pam Anderson! so everyone SEE THIS MOVIE!!! it definitely breaks the stereotype of the latest remakes and crappy comedies out there today...now get ready to have a sexytime!!!",10,22,53,12 August 2006
