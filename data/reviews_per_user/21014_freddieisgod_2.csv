First Man," Good film ruined...
",This is a fascinating story well told & brilliantly acted. However for me the film is ruined by the constant shaky camera. From about 2 minutes into the film I was feeling motion sickness and spent the rest of the film either with my eyes closed or looking at the floor.The sections with a steady camera such as the scenes on the moon were beautifully done and fantastic... so why ruin the rest of the movie with constant nauseating shaky camera work??,5,61,110,13 October 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," It Will Rock You!!
","As a massive Queen fan I was a little sceptical to begin with. Would they do Freddie & the band as a whole justice? The jury was out.Well my fears were well and truely put to rest. What a fantastic film. The whole cast are brilliant but I have to say for me the two shining lights are Remi Malek's portrail of Freddie - truely Oscar worthy (but sadly the movie won't win any Oscars as it's not in black & white, pretentious & with subtitles!!!!) and Gwilym Lee as Brian May. Gwilym is so scarily like Brian you simply forget it's not Brian on screen.The climax of the movie with Live Aid is so phenomenally well done it's jaw dropping. If this move doesn't have you singing, stamping & clapping along then you must be dead. Cannot wait to go see it again (and again and again).",10,3,4,5 November 2018
