Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Wow
","Probably the funniest movie ever made... I could not stop laughing... SBC is a genius.. Borat is the most creative character ever created and today is the day that everyone has to take notice of his taking over the world. From the US to Britian to Kazakstan, he is able to make fun of people's intellectual flaws to their face and come out on top by playing the whole 'slow, dumb, confused foreigner' to perfection. Balky has nothing on Borat. I would be surprised if this movie does not open #1 in the box office as the word is spreading fast that this creation is well worth the ticket price even in 2006. Congrats to all who played a role in bringing this film to the big screen. Sacha please bring the Ali G show back to the the US soon, we are dying for Season 3!",10,6,20,23 September 2006
