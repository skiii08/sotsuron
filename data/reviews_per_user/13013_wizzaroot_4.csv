Walk the Line," Enjoyable and well-acted
","I wanted to see this film for 2 reasons. First off, I am a long time Joaquin Phoenix fan. I remember him when he had to fit his tiny little body into a huge space suit and save the day in Space Camp, and when he was a troubled pre-teen having to deal with a deadbeat dad in Parenthood. As an adult, he conquered Rome. And now, he's conquered again. I must confess, I know little about the real Mr. Cash, so I can't comment on his portrayal, but the performance was stellar as always. His emotional moments with June(Reese) were moving. And his reactions to his father's rejections and humiliations felt so natural---and that piercing stare over the Thanksgiving table was wonderfully intense. I would have loved to see him get best actor (still not a Clooney fan). Oh well.Secondly, okay, you caught me...THE HYPE--- I normally HATE, and I can't emphasize this enough, HATE hyped up movies...However, if it involves one of my favs, whelp...I'm guilty.As far as my thoughts on the movie in general...It was enjoyable. The supporting cast was talented and did well. Although, I didn't see anything special about Reese's performance. Yeah, it was good, but, come on, Oscar-worthy? I didn't find the movie boring as some on the site have said. It's a story about a man's life. Honestly, and I've said this before, I'm not sure what those people were expecting to happen. maybe they thought they were there to see Crash and got confused.In summary, I liked it. It's worth the time!",7,0,0,9 March 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Very enjoyable, and quite moving
","Let me start by saying that I really liked it. The acting was great overall, and the dialog/plot seemed believable. Also, if you're the type that is still a little uncomfortable watching homosexual situations, you shouldn't be afraid to see this movie...It was tastefully done.As far as the acting, my favorite performance would have to be that of Michelle Williams. She brought such emotion and pure feeling to that part. Her performance was sincere and moving. Anne Hathaway was equally great, but with a more subdued character. She was the type that acted as if nothing could touch her, that she had everything in control, and in the end, you witness the pain that was always there...she really made it work. Randy Quaid was just as impressive. He showed yet another facet of his acting talent. His character was dead on. I know men like him, and he hit the nail on the head. Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant as always. He is one of my favorites since Donnie Darko, and he just has an extreme and inspiring talent for acting. The only complaint here for me is Heath Ledger. He was not horrible, but I found the accent, and mannerisms a little rehearsed. I just didn't buy it. He was a non-cowboy trying to act like a cowboy...it's just the general feeling I got.Some people on the site are complaining of a slow moving story, and that nothing really happens. I even heard some comments to that same effect on my way out of the theater. The fact is, this is really an all out drama. The basic story of a group of people and the hardships they endure through a number of years. I'm not sure what everyone is expecting to happen. If you like tons of action, murder and mayhem, graphic sexuality, or other in your face types of themes, then you won't enjoy this. But...if you're like me, and you enjoy seeing everyday people facing the challenges of life, and struggling to find happiness, then you'll be in awe.As for the sexuality, I don't judge people on it, but I have to admit, I was a little uncomfortable during a few of the love scenes. I will say though, that I thought they were tastefully done, leaving a lot to the imagination...which, for my taste, is more enjoyable...whether it is gay or straight.That sums it up! I was very impressed with this movie!",9,16,18,28 January 2006
Batman Begins," Fun! Strangely Realistic
","Okay, I got a kick out of this movie! My husband begged me to see it, and I finally agreed. See, I know nothing of the original batman comics, so I couldn't appreciate the movie's faithfulness to them. I just remember seeing those reruns of the TV show when I was a kid. Then, here comes Tim Burton with his one of a kind style, and new and beautiful concept of Batman. Now after being a big Burton fan, I was leery of a movie that might stray from that intriguing, crime fighting, yet dark persona that I fell in love with. To my delight, it didn't! The movie seemed well organized, developed, and designed. The action was great, and the Dark Knight was as sexy and mysterious as ever!",8,1,1,9 March 2006
War of the Worlds," Overall entertaining, but unfortunately has to cater to all
","War of the Worlds. As with all 'summer blockbusters' this movie is meant to pack'em in. The creators were trying to please every audience here. That is unfortunate for everyone. The problem is, you can't please all of the people all of the time, so they are trying to please all of us at least part of the time here. The film, to start out, had a lot going for it. The effects were amazing, the action was great, and it was very suspenseful. The apathy of the invaders was frightening and it chills you to the bone. The movie even manages to feel nostalgic in remembering the older film and has a very vintage UFO feel. So what's the problem? Well, with the necessity to cater to all, the creators felt they needed to have a sweet, cutsie, ending for the lead characters. I know there are those among us who can't stand to see a movie end on a downer, but come on. Aliens have just come a hairline away from conquering the entire planet, killing everyone, leveling towns, searching basements for any leftover survivors, obliterating everything, and we're supposed to watch Tom Cruise come walking down the street to his ex-parents-in-law's house, where the entire family welcomes him at the door without a scratch!?! They look as if they just sat down for Sunday dinner for God's sake! And if that wasn't enough, of course, the son lived, and made it home! Come on guys, would it have killed them to knock off at least one lead?!? The conclusion is, this happy little ending is merely, in my mind an attempt to cater to that gum drop audience who probably used to be 'full House' fans. I think if you're able to look past that, then you'll enjoy yourself. If these cookie cutter endings really get you down though, you may wait till you can rent it, so at least you can skip the mushy stuff.",7,4,7,5 July 2005
