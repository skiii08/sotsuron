","Dramatic and Thrilling story that really connects the viewer to feel part of the film. As this film is portrayed around one specific village called 'villa la Russia' within this war driven Soviet Union,we immediately get the feel that enables our five senses to really feel what this young boy is feeling during the beginning and end of his journey within this atmosphere. While we also get the perspective of the civilians within this war, and the grueling events that they are destined to face, the audience quickly receives the reverse montage that is shown to give a strong connection. Throughout the young boy's journey, he remains wondering why he wants to be part of a resistance, only to quickly grow up and develop his fast understanding of this war and how it is not about hate, killing, or victory but something more. The incredible sound effects and amazing camera positioning, really gives us the full dramatic feel that is going on, this keeps us at the edge of our seat to eagerly want to know if this young boy will make it past this torn world. At the end of the movie, we are following the resistance, then the camera turns to another path, leading the screen to show the development of snow on the trail, which possibly demonstrates the state of a Russian winter that has given victory to Russian territory in past wars. Thus giving the audience a sense of hope for this resistance, and how they will possibly prevail and preserve their homeland front. Overall this dramatic, intense thriller does an amazing job by making this film a physical production, where everything within the scenes are not staged.",9,1,1,8 February 2012
