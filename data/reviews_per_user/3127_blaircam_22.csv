Saturday Night Fever," The movie ages but the soundtrack is timeless!!!
",This film has to be a classic in anyone's books. Yes it looks a little dated by our standards but it chronicled a phenomenon AND a culture. The story is not uplifting - in fact it is occassionally downright depressing - but it is powerful. I also have to say I hummed 'More than a woman' for days afterward. Those Bee Gees sure are something. My vote a well deserved 8/10,8,0,1,26 March 2002
Minority Report," Fascinating idea and well executed.
","I generally get annoyed when people say that any given movie wasn't as good as it could have been. IMHO a movie is what it is - if you don't like it make a better version yourself. That said, I have some sympathy with those that have suggested something along those lines with this film. It is an amazing premise and technically stunningly well done. It could not possibly have covered all possibilities and would always have left some aspects hanging (I always thought any real in-depth analysis of the plight of the pre-cogs or the legality of sentencing for attempted murder as though there was actual murder was going to be lacking) but for all that it remains a fantastic movie, a wonderful ride and very thought-provoking. Any film that can have me talking, thinking and questioning 24 hours later is worth an 8 - which is what I give this movie.",8,0,0,2 March 2003
Memento," Wow
","Pierce takes what could easily have been a concept just too silly for words and turns it into something remarkable. Of course, the other cast and crew helped but Pierce really shone. A really thought provoking movie brilliantly executed. I think the voting for this is a little high, but not much. My vote 8/10",8,0,1,2 November 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Not terrible, but could have been better.
",This film has received some patchy reviews and most of the criticisms are accurate - if perhaps a little over the top. As far as love stories go it is a little sallow. As far as war movies go it is somewhat irrelevant. But as a combined love in war movie you could do worse. The accents are somewhat annoying and occassionally distracting but with an ensemble cast that's always going to be a problem. Just sit back and enjoy and simple and harmless (relatively speaking) ride. My vote 6/10,6,1,4,19 May 2002
Snatch," Just a couple quick comments
","Firstly let me say, yes, this film is very much in the Lock,Stock mold. However, simply because a movie features gangsters, violence, intertwining plotlines and snappy camera-work, IT DOES NOT MAKE IT A TARANTINO RIP-OFF!!! This type of statement is coming from ignorant, self-important Americans.Secondly, I too am a little surprised at the place this film currently holds in the top 250. It simply doesn't belong there. Yes, it is clever and well-made. But it is simply not significant enough to deserve that spot.Ok, that said this is an entertaining movie, along similar lines to Lock, Stock. Good luck trying to understand Brad Pitt's 'Pikie' accent.My vote 7/10",7,0,0,2 July 2001
Closer," Absolutely awful
","This is a truly rare creature, a storyline without a single sympathetic character or redeeming feature. The four chief protagonists (a word chosen deliberately) are so thoroughly unlikeable that I had no interest whatsoever in watching their misery unfold. I also struggled to imagine anyone acting in such a way as the ensemble - an impressive cast indeed - and simply could not relate to any aspect of the film. Jude Law's dialogue and Julia Roberts' reactions when she was photographing him were nauseating and the notion that she might not have simply laughed in his face defies logic. In my experience people seldom act like they do in this movie and, for the very few who do, their lives end up in nothing but misery. I have and had no interest in watching this train-wreck happen on screen.",1,4,8,16 September 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Visually stunning
","***SPOILER ALERT IN THESE COMMENTS*** OK, let me first say that it was an amazing movie. The acting was remarkable, the effects incredible, the scenery lovely (NZ - one of my all-time favorite holiday destinations), and the story overwhelming. BUT there was simply no resolution to ANY of the central issues or conflicts. Talk about sucking you into coming back for the sequel!!! Now I haven't read the books (I did read the Hobbit) and I did know it was part of a series, but I expected there to be some type of conclusion at the end. I was simply left hanging! That for me was sufficient to see my score go from a 9 to an 8 out of 10. If the next episode does the same it will drop from an 8 to a 7!",8,0,0,16 January 2002
Spider-Man," Entertaining - mostly; cringe-worthy - occassionally; but never brilliant
","This film was quite enjoyable but some of the 'romantic' scenes were bordering on execrable. I struggled to understand why more viewers weren't vomitting at these nauseatingly puerile teen wannabes. Dunst's character was far from the classic hero's love-interest. She was closer to the town bicycle, stumbling from one partner to another at a pace that would make the 'Sex and the City' girls cringe. The action, what there was of it, was entertainly and slickly rendered (for the most part) but was really all too predictable and the obvious sequel ending avaricious in the extreme. All in all I struggle to understand how this film can be running at the vote that it currently is - except that it is a sad indictment on the movie-makers and watchers! My vote - a kind 7/10.",7,0,0,1 November 2002
No Man's Land," Wow - brilliant perspective on a tragedy
","This was a fantastic film. I admit to being slightly hesitant about the sub-titles but I'm glad I didn't let it put me off. I'd heard good things about this film and they are all true. This film is a must see for anyone who is interested in a new perspective on war, racial divisions and the futility of hate. My vote - another strong 8/10",8,4,9,17 April 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Appallingly overhyped and over-rated
","I simply cannot believe the triumph of style over substance that the current voting for Moulin Rouge! represents. The story is predictable and cliched. The dialogue almost unbearable after the first five seconds when one realises that song lyrics are to make up the bulk of the 'profundity'. The acting is adequate, the singing and dancing are impressively staged but this film is almost unbearable to sit through and holds no interest or surprises. It reminds me of a lavish Rock Eistedfodd. My vote 6/10 (only because of the lead actors and musical numbers).",6,1,2,13 February 2002
Mulholland Drive," WOW!!!
","To me this film seems very much the kind that you either love or hate. For a little while I wasn't entirely sure which side of the line I was going to come down on until I landed firmly in the 'love' camp. Certainly this film is unusual - Lynch doesn't disappoint in presenting a surreal, dreamlike montage lacking any clear plot progression - but it doesn't suffer from the apparently disjointed story-telling. If anything, it benefits from it. Your choice as to how you view the film, I tend to read it as fantasy/dream/illusion first, reality last. The fantasy juxtaposed against the grim reality of Tinseltown. Anyways, much to think and talk about here. That, at the end of the day, is how I ultimately judge a good film. If I leave it provoked, thoughtful and different somehow it has been effective. My vote 8/10 (almost a 9)",8,0,1,8 July 2002
A Bug's Life," Fun for the whole family
","Any film that can entertain my wife, myself and my 2 year old all at the same time is worth a minimum of 7/10 in my book. On top of that, this film was actually very engaging and clever - its absolutely up next to Toy Story 2. Another Pixar triumph. my vote 8/10",8,0,0,27 July 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," An awful lot was expected of this film and - for the most part - it delivers.
","Obviously there was an enormous amount of pressure, expectation, and anticipation for this movie and I, for one, was not too disappointed. Ok, it was not a 10, but at least it was fairly faithful to the book. I think its failure may, in some respects, have been that it was too faithful to the book. A film will never quite be able to match the imaginations of millions of children. My wife critised the acting of the children but it was a children's fantasy movie for goodness sake - chronic overacting was required input. I think that the movie is running at almost exactly the right vote. As my brother remarked, 'not so much a 10 on any one thing but a solid 8 all around'.",8,0,0,3 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Some brilliant, some terrible...
","On the whole, somewhat disappointing. Some parts of the film were as spectacular as the first movie, but this sequel had way too much 'blah, blah, blah' for the action fans and the psuedo-intellectual/profound remarks were often laugh-out-loud ridiculous. I literally sniggered at some of Morpheus' remarks - did it really need to have so much rah-rah-rah??? As for the Agent Smith duplication thing - well, I got the picture after there were about half a dozen... did adding another 94 really improve the scene? Especially once it descended into video-game mode? In all I would still recommend seeing this movie - and on the big screen - but I wouldn't be too upset if you happened to miss it. My vote 7/10",7,0,0,27 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful mind and a brilliant film
","Well, Russell Crowe was far better than I expected - he deserved the Oscar. Likewise Jennifer Connelly was amazing and also deserved an Oscar (I watched Monster's Ball almost immediately after A Beautiful Mind so I have grounds for comparison). Wonderful story wonderfully done. A very strong 8/10",8,0,1,29 July 2002
Wedding Crashers," Modern Romantic Comedy
","Just watched this last night and I really enjoyed it. It manages to be something that is pretty rare, namely a romantic comedy that is both romantic and funny. Most romantic comedies go heavy on the romance and soft on the comedy (ie anything with Meg Ryan in it - the odd funny bit/moment - mostly about the every-girl eventually hooking up with the right man). This film is laugh-out-loud funny most of the way through. Its also a great buddy movie and has a great romantic plot line running through-out. The most surprising thing, however (at least for me) was the lovely Isla Fisher. I expected very little from her but she absolutely stole this movie from under her far more accomplished leads. She was cute, funny and utterly terrifying all at the same time. Nice to see a former Perth girl ripping it up. This is not sophisticated in any sense of the word but if you're looking for a light, fun watch this could be for you.",8,1,3,25 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A real curate's egg...
","It seems from the more popular comments that people want to believe that this episode is a vindication of Lucas' genius. Firstly let me say that Lucas' genius needs no vindication but if it did - this film would not be it. It is a classic example of the proverbial curate's egg - absolutely breathtaking in its scope and vision in parts, and agonisingly, excruciatingly unbearable in parts. However, it really had to achieve just three main things, 1) marry the storyline up with A New Hope - achieved, 2) appease the die-hards - apparently achieved, and 3) create an engaging film which is capable of standing independently - highly questionable. The concepts and ideas tend to work well, the 'big' scenes and fights are pretty spectacular but the personal journeys of the major protagonists and the inter-personal and particularly the romantic elements were abysmal. I know I'm not the first to say this but I think Lucas is spectacular at what he does well. Unfortunately character development and romance are not part of his incredible repertoire. Just my opinion - no doubt some will agree, others call me crazy.",6,0,1,17 July 2005
The Iron Giant," What are you people talking about?
",This is a nice little film. Ok the animation quality isn't bad and the story is kinda nice - but this doesn't deserve it's ranking in the top #250 or the 8.something rating it's currently running at. An innocuous film for the family it is simply way out of its league against some of the films it is ranked higher than! I hope that we will see some more voting and a rationalisation of the position of this film. My vote 6/10,6,2,13,10 September 2001
Signs," A film in two parts
","This film started very promisingly with some clear nods to some of the masters of suspense (very Hitchcockian opening). It develops some interesting tension and gets pretty creepy - but then it seems to lose its way. It goes from a chilling thriller to little more than a vehicle to get Mel to come around. (I also thought M Night Shyamalan's cameo was a bit too substantial to really be a directorial cameo but that's neither here nor there.) Still, in all not a bad movie - it just took the route too easy rather than the one less travelled. That's Hollywood I guess. My vote 7/10 (and a bit surprised to see this film currently in the top 250 of all time!).",7,0,1,22 August 2002
A Night at the Roxbury," Hey, what's up? You from outta town?
","This movie is actually quite funny and definitely worth more than the terrible vote its currently running at. Ok, its basically a one gag film but it plays it out well, doesn't try to be anything it isn't, and actually has some real laugh-out-loud funny bits (my wife cracked up at the 'checking the diary' scene for about 5 mins!). I also watched Stuart Little - the rankings of these two movies should be reversed! My vote 6/10",6,1,2,10 February 2002
Heat," Very good, a little long ***spoiler alert***
","I did really like this film, good action, great story. It was a treat seeing two of the modern era's finest actors at work as well. However, I hated the ending!!! How improbable is it that De Niro, behind cover, would expose himself entirely, and Pacino, firing into the bright landing lights and having to turn 90 degrees could still get off a shot first??? Anyways, very good film and definitely watchable if only for the stellar cast.",7,0,0,29 October 2001
Pocahontas," typical Disney fare
","Well, what Disney does it does quite well, but don't go expecting anything other than your standard Disney movie. This film is clearly in the same vein as all the rest and if you're looking for something simple, short and suitable for children you could do worse. Unfortunately, that's all there is to this movie. More recent offerings have demonstrated that it is possible to make movies fun for kids without making them nauseating for adults (see Toy Story 2, Shrek etc.) My vote 4/10 (but as a kid's movie maybe a 6/10)",4,1,8,5 November 2001
