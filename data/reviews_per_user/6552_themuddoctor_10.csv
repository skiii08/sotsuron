The King's Speech," Poignant and exciting
","This past year's Academy Award winner for Best Picture, The King's Speech, looked to me like another boring exercise in British stuffiness. I was wrong. I don't think that there has ever been another film about the British royal family that has been as intimate and emotionally absorbing. For once, the royals were portrayed as human beings. Even 2006's The Queen, featuring Helen Mirren's portrayal of the current queen, for which she won Best Actress, felt to me like a cold and distant portrayal of an inhuman old woman cut off from the world. Colin Firth's depiction of King George VI (the current queen's father) was incredibly poignant, and it earned him a hugely deserved Oscar for Best Actor.

Sucker Punch," Pretensious, incoherent, hypocritical trash
",Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch is the kind of film that was designed purely to fulfill the fantasies of the G4 addicted gamers that creamed their shorts when they first saw sneak previews of it at Comic-Con. The film itself succinctly highlights a disturbing trend among the ever-popular subculture of geekdom: its rampant sexism and utter lack of imagination. This is one of the most unintelligible and brainless movies of recent years. The screenplay seems to have been constructed out of the fragmented thoughts and suggestions of a fifteen year-old video game addict with ADD.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Quite good actually
","The Harry Potter films are the highest grossing film franchise of all time. This is precisely why when I heard that the final of J.K. Rowling's epic fantasy saga novels was going to be broken into two parts, I was skeptical. To me it seemed like a shameless attempt at milking as much money out of the moviegoers as they possibly could. However, after having seen both of the final films, I now see that it was really the best course of action that the filmmakers could have taken. The Potter films have gotten increasingly darker since the first one debuted way back in 2001. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is the darkest film of the bunch so far.

Bridesmaids," Bridesmaids is a hoot!
","It has become abundantly clear over the past couple of years that the most talented performer on the Saturday Night Live roster is Kristen Wiig. She has the kind of boundless energy and idiosyncratic wackiness that the show had been missing for too long. Watching her on SNL, you realize that you're watching someone who will more than likely be a star one day. With the release of the blockbuster hit Bridesmaids, written by and starring Wiig, that day has finally come. We live in a time when the raunchy comedies have been almost monopolized by men.

Drive," Drive is like no other action movie out there right now
","I can't imagine that anybody who watches Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive will see exactly what they were expecting. The odd thing is though, if you were expecting a high-octane, 80's B-movie inspired, violent action thriller, that's what you get; if you were expecting an aesthetically European art-house flick, that's also what you get. This is the stuff movie buff dreams are made of. Ryan Gosling stars as our unnamed protagonist, a taciturn Hollywood stunt driver and mechanic who moonlights as a getaway driver for criminals. He becomes smitten with his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and begins spending a lot of time with she and her young son, but soon her husband is released from prison and moves back in with them.

Insidious," Insidious mostly works
","James Wan's Insidious is an oddly disjointed film. The first half is an extremely successful haunted house fright-fest, while the second half is an incredibly dense and illogical slog. In any horror film of this type, originality is not usually what you're going to get, and you don't here either. What you can hope for however is that the tried-and-true methods of creeping the audience out will be performed expertly, which, for the most part, the filmmakers manage to do. This is a composed and subdued horror film that relies on what you don't see as much as what you do to scare you. Surprising given that it's brought to us by the screenwriter and director of Saw.

Super 8," Super 8 is a noble failure
","Super 8 director, J.J. Abrams has obviously been greatly influenced by the films of Steven Spielberg, who just happens to be a producer of this one. His attempt in the film to pair blockbuster action with heartfelt emotion is a noble one, but in the end, unsuccessful. The film takes place in 1979 Ohio, where young Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), reeling from his mother's death in a factory accident, is helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make a super-8 zombie movie. Joe's stern police officer dad (Kyle Chandler) finds it hard to understand and empathize with him and seems to put his work before his own son.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A hugely satisfying finale
","Watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2 (say that ten times fast) it dawns on you just how well crafted the entire series has been. This final installment perfectly ties everything up with just the right amount of gravitas, intensity, and feel-good warmth. This is no longer a film series for kids, it's a film series for people who were kids when they saw the first film, and are now at the precipice of adulthood, just like Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson). This has been key to maintaining the utter hysteria over all things Potter over the past decade. Read my full review at: http://bit.ly/nXwqK9",Null,0,0,6 September 2011
The Social Network," Shockingly powerful and entertaining
","I'm not sure that there has been a more intelligent, timely, and entertaining movie in recent years as David Fincher's brilliant The Social Network. Anchored by Fincher's breakneck pacing, the impressive performances, the moving electronic musical score, and Aaron Sorkin's crackling, Oscar winning screenplay. If I had been told two years ago that a movie based on the founding of Facebook would be this good I would have scoffed. In fact, the very idea of this movie was off-putting to me, but it is so much better than it has any right to be. In fact, this movie was ten times more entertaining than any big-budget action movie all year.

The Fighter," Good, not great
","The story of Micky Ward, the Lowell, Massachusetts boxing underdog who fought his way to the top of the game was destined to be a movie. The Fighter features larger-than-life characters, a love story, and some truly rousing fight scenes, and yet it's missing something. Micky himself, played here with quiet dignity by Mark Whalberg, just isn't an engaging enough character for us to get behind fully. However, there's enough grade-A acting and swift pacing to make up for that. The Fighter was directed by the controversial but acclaimed David O. Russell, known for films such as Spanking the Monkey and Three Kings. His direction here is straightforward, but artful. Read my full review at: http://bit.ly/nzVwGz",Null,0,0,5 September 2011
