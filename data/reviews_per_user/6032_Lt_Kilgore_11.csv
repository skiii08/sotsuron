","The greatest adventure film of all time, and Spielberg's most life-affirming film.  There's a little something in it for everyone, so I fully recommend it.  Harrison Ford's charisma leads the film, and the evil (and stereotypical) nazis make scary villians. RATING: 9",Null,0,0,29 January 2001
Casablanca," The American Classic
","An example of true greatness in film, Casablanca is, perhaps, the most popular film of all time.  It has the characteristics that any great film should have: good acting, a good script, good direction, etc.  Perhaps Casablanca's greatest characteristic is that it gets better with every viewing.  There really isn't much to say about what millions call the greatest film of all time that hasn't already been said.

Citizen Kane," Cinema's Greatest Achievement
","The film that defines a masterpiece, Citizen Kane is a film which revolutionized the industry of filmmaking.  Without it, so many of our favorite films would never have existed, so its influence alone makes Citizen Kane a great achievement.  But the film itself, which was incredibly innovative for its time, is just as innovative today, as there is meaning behind every frame.  Whether you're watching the film to enjoy a good story or to study it, it never fails to satisfy.  While Citizen Kane may be technically perfect, it does lack the emotional pull to make it truly perfect.  Citizen Kane will probably remain the greatest achievement in the history of film.",Null,0,1,27 January 2001

","I've always been a big fan of Dr. Strangelove, and I love it more every time I see it.  The performances are what make Dr. Strangelove a hilarious film. Unlike other comedies, this film contains a powerful message, which should be obvious to anyone who watches it.  Its the only comedy I've seen that can be funny as well as foreboding.RATING: 10",Null,0,0,29 January 2001

","The sequel to the award-winning masterpiece is just as compelling. Although the two films are always compared, they really are very different.  The original concentrates on what the mafia is and what it does, and it uses a more heartfelt approach.  The Godfather: Part II is a sequel as well as a prequel, comparing Michael's rise into power with Vito's, making the story even more depressing.  I've always found Vito's storyline more interesting, but the ending of the film, in which Michael murders or alienates everyone close to him, is perfectly executed.  The Godfather: Part II is slow at times,`but in the end, it packs a wallop.RATING: 9",Null,0,0,29 January 2001

","As of the most innovative film noir's to come out of the 90's, The Usual Suspects deserves more credit then its gotten.  Perhaps its not one of the top 15 films of all time, as voted, but it deserved more oscar nominations, being that it was one of the best movies of 1995.  RATING: 9",Null,0,1,29 January 2001

","One of the most fascinating movies ever made, and an example of cinematic perfection, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a timeless masterpiece that all should see.  It never lacks in pace, it is always an entertaining picture.  The performances make the film incredibly realistic.  Deserving of every oscar it won.RATING: 10",Null,0,1,29 January 2001

","One of Alfred Hitchcock's better efforts, Rear Window is also one of his best loved films; many consider it his best.  While I'll admit, I'm not a huge fan of the film, it is clever and innovative.  I just never got into the film.  I've always preferred Vertigo, Psycho, North by Northwest, and Strangers on a Train.RATING: 8",Null,0,1,29 January 2001

","Casino is a great example of how great a director Martin Scorsese is. He shows us the violent underworld of Las Vegas, and does so very effectively. Casino has become one of my favorite performances because of how stunningly realistic the film is.  The acting brings the characters to life, and the film moves at a quick pace, which is good for a three hour film. Unfortunately, Casino will always be underrated because of Goodfellas, which came first.  However, I believe Casino is the more fascinating and thoughtful of the two.RATING: 10",Null,1,3,29 January 2001

","George Lucas' most influential film is often considered a science fiction film.  I completely disagree with this.  A science fiction film, in my opinion, is storytelling which tries to make us feel like things are out of the ordinary. Aliens and spaceships don't automatically certify the film as sci fi.  I would consider Star Wars a fantasy, because it takes us out of our world and into another.  Star Wars is pure entertainment, fulfilling one of the key purposes of cinema.  One of the reasons Star Wars has been so successful is because it is like a cure for everyday life, you can just leave to another galaxy far far way.RATING: 10",Null,0,0,29 January 2001

","The Godfather is an American classic, because it contains basically everything a great movie needs.  The flawless performances make the movie incredibly realistic, and the cinematography and score make The Godfather even more effective.  Practically everyone who watches it falls under its spell in the first or second viewing.  A film of such power deserves to be considered one of the greats.  However, the trip to Sicily is pointless and time consuming, which takes a point off the grade.RATING: 9",Null,0,1,29 January 2001
