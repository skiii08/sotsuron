Blade Runner 2049," A long wait for disappointment.
","Having waited a long time to see the movie, I almost turned it off. Then I looked at the ratings - with incredulity. Had I fallen through the looking glass. Reality check: others had the same opinion. It was long, it felt long, and it was so slow. I had no trouble following the plot, but the pacing was like Waiting for Godot - without the humour. At least half an hour could have been edited out. Perhaps editors feel that a lot of money has been spent on CGI/special effects so they need to be kept in. No.
Spoiler (kind of): If the child is a human/replicant cross, the question of Deckard's being human is moot - unless Rachel decided to experiment.
By no means is this equal to or better than the original. You would not miss out if you miss seeing it",3,2,5,10 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Not super good.
","Even whilst watching it, I felt disappointed: slow, wordy, sloppy storyline. Even the final battle was excessive to the point of tedious: too much fast cutting and too many unnecessary characters. Despite enjoying and appreciating most of the Marvel films, I felt this was a letdown.",4,28,42,22 May 2019
Whiplash," The tempo is just right.
","I had no idea what the film was about and therefore had no preconceptions. I wondered about watching it for the first few minutes but then became intrigued by the possibilities. Although it is based in a jazz situation, that is subsumed by the drama between and of the characters. As a genre it may not be original but the writing, directing and performances make it a standout film with a climax as tense and dramatic as any.",10,1,3,17 February 2017
