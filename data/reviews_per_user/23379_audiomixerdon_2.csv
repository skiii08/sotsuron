Sucker Punch," Weird, sexy, amazing, boring, wtf, etc
","This movie is all over the place. And that's not a bad thing, but it's not a good thing. Huh? Exactly. Beautiful cinematography and CGI. But it's like they had three or four short films planned and said let's throw them into one and pray.Glad I watched it. It's fun on the eyes.",5,3,5,3 May 2020
Aquaman," Written by a 3rd grader?
","When my 8 year old can guess every cliched response, there might be a problem. Script was bad. Acting was mostly bad(Dolph? Terrible!) CGI just looked awful. DC has a long way to go to match the magic that Marvel brings. Nicole KiDDman was not believable at all. (And yes DD in her name now, as she obviously had new flotation devices installed for her underwater scenes!)All in all, just a decent movie.",5,2,3,7 April 2019
