Casablanca," casablanca
",It has a very good story of a careless man always looking out for himself eventually finding purpose.Played by Humphrey Bogart who does an excellent job in his role. There are a lot of foreign actors in this film as well. It was a great way to portray the message the director was trying to get across which was that the world needed Americas help during the war. This movie although iconic and well known can have its true purpose easily looked over by a viewer today. But back when the film was made it had a huge impact on the views of the war. The sets for each scene are done very well even though most take place in the main characters night club. It has a bit of an eerie feeling added to it from the dim lighting which increase the suspense of the film and add a shady feeling to it. All in all a classic film that should be seen by every movie lover.,8,1,2,8 May 2013
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","Is Orson Welles first feature film in which he acted wrote and produced. It has a lot of abstract and unique scene transitions and shots. A lot of new ways to shoot are introduced through this film. Orson also shows his acting expertise as well as his writing and directing. He is one of the first people in film to do all three and be successful at it. The film itself has a interesting plot with a lot of twists and mystery.The film exposes the audience to an auetur director who has complete control of all aspects because he also acts.It is all about finding the significance of a mans last dying words 'rosebud'. Very talented director,actor, writer, and a very good film.",7,0,1,8 May 2013
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
",A very steller performance by Robert De Niro. He is an estranged ex vet who works the latenight shift as a taxi driver. He feels as if he has no real purpose after the war and has a tendency to find himself in trouble from his violent outlashes. Eventually he finds a prostitute whom he begins to care about and watch after. It starts to pick up a lot of pace at some points and also has some slow points.It also does a very good job of portraying the city environment to add to the realism. The lighting in scenes really helps set the mood. There are a lot of twists and scenes that keep you nailbitting. I think it is a great movie that should be seen by everyone.,10,0,0,8 May 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Grapes of wraith
",I enjoyed this movie a lot. It does a great job of portraying history and what it was like after the economic crash of United States. The main character is a very righteous man who has been through a lot and after serving a jail sentence comes home to find out his family is leaving his Oklahoma farm. They are off to California due to he dust storms and infertile farmland. On their journey they face many trials and tribulations in which the protagonist must help his family overcome in order to help them have a safe trip to California.throughout the film there is very epic scenes that are quite inspiring as well as very poetic and epic dialogue. There is a lot of substance to take from this film and it is very easy to feel for the characters in this which I think is awesome because it almost brings you back to that very same time period.,9,0,1,13 March 2013
Annie Hall," Annie hall
",A very sweet love story. Its a really cool movie cause you just kinda watch there relationship grow and see all the ups and downs. As well as the kindness in the characters there is a lot of comedic relief throughout the film and subtle comedy. It was directed by woody allen and wrote by woody allen. It takes place in the city and really captures what it is like to live in the city. Both of the main actors do an excellent job at showing there emotions. It is a very real feeling movie and anyone who has gone through relationships can relate to the story. It has helped set the tone for romantic comedies today and i really enjoyed how genuinely real the movie felt.,Null,0,0,8 May 2013
The Graduate," The Graduate
",A very odd love story to say the least. It is quite the comic film in subtle ways and it has a lot of romantic twists. As Dustin Hoffmans character tries to dodge his bosses wife mrs robinson but at the same time he is falling for her daughter. Dustin Hoffman does as really good job at acting as a newly graduated college student trying to get on his feet and stay away from trouble.The film is very good at continuously filming and rotating in conversations. I like how the direct shoots his scenes and focuses on specific aspects to show you what the character is focusing on. I thought it was a good movie with a very good performance by Dustin Hoffman.,9,0,0,8 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Signing in the rain
",I didn't like the film i thought it was drawn out way to long at the end when you already knew what was going to happen. Im not big on musicals though i thought the artistic aspect of the film was very cool. As well as the ability of the main character to act and dance. I liked how the film used colors as well certain scenes were very vibrant with colors to set the mood while others had a lot of grey in them. I thought the setup for the film was amazing though as well as the editingt. The scenes were immensely large and abstract. Though i don't like musicals i thought a lot of the film was interesting even though i didn't like the music there is a lot of visuals in the film i found to be cool.,4,7,13,8 May 2013
Psycho," Psycho
",One of the most classic horror films in history. It is a Hitchcock film in which a beautiful women finds what she thinks is a very nice proper man but is wrong. He was abused and dominated by his mother as a child which lead him to become the Psycho.Hitchcock plays the code very well and uses different shots and angles to show the horror of his film instead of directly showing the killings. A scene that is almost always mentioned when talking about horror films is in this film the epic shower scene. Which has seemed to be adopted by a lot of horror films after Psycho was made. The story itself is pretty intricate for a horror film and i really enjoyed watching it.,10,0,0,8 May 2013
