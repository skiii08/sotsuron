The Incredible Hulk," Hulk a much better film version than previous attempts
","I can't say that this film blew me away but I must give credit to the producers and actors who made it a much better version than any previous attempts.The romantic parts were a little overdrawn and found no problem taking bathroom breaks during those portions.The film seems to borrow a little from a lot of other action films. I can see elements of King Kong, the Bourne films, First Blood, and others.But it is a 10 of 10 if you are a Hulkster. If you are not I would rate it 6 of 10.",6,2,5,23 June 2008
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Alpha was 'A New Hope' the Omega was 'Rogue One'
","One only has to watch 'A New Hope' and 'Rogue One'
and the story is complete. Simply brilliant. The very best bar none. These are my favorite characters, screenplay, action, and though left feeling numb at the end, I loved it all.",10,1,2,23 December 2019
The Town," Worth investing a little time
","This movie is worth taking the time to go see. As a former cop and detective the way the FBI works on the suspects is very convincing. The fact that the crew was able to continue working with the cops knowing so much tended to keep this a solid escapism film.The plot and sub plot worked well and reminded me of a nice pulp fiction story. I don't want to spoil any of the film so suffice it to say that it is worth going to see.Jeremy Renner from the Hurt Locker was stellar, Jon Hamm pulled it off I never thought he was Don Draper, Rebeca Hall, and Ben Affleck were also good. The supporting cast did not disappoint either.The cast made this movie work. I can honestly say I liked all the characters. Blake Lively acted just like her character would have in real life. She is the true victim of her environment and there was no redemption for her.",9,27,52,19 September 2010
Shutter Island," A movie on ADHD
","A Federal Marshall going to investigate the escape and disappearance of an inmate in an Criminal Insane Asylum. Great plot the trailers were outstanding. DiCaprio was stellar and believable as the Marshall. In fact all of the acting was good. The problem with this movie was the disjointed script. The movie did not really flow and seemed like a poor copy of an m night shyamalan film. M Night needed to be involved in this screenplay. I was so bored, dozed off twice, that I did not really care where the plot tried to take me. The saving grace was the strength of the cast but the cast could not overcome a very poor screenplay. Scorcese dropped the ball on this one. Much too bouncy. Like a mind that bounces from idea to idea and never really gets anything done. Don't waste your time on this one. The movie was as insane as the inmates.",3,9,18,7 March 2010
Oblivion," Elements of Slaughterhouse Five. Enjoyable yarn. Fresh Take.
",I went to the movie tonight with my son. I enjoyed the film. Tom Cruise was on target cast as 'Jack Harper' who has flashbacks reminiscent of Billy Pilgrim. Combat and a nice little spin on the space house Billy Pilgrim lived in with Valerie Perrine. I won't tell some of the differences because I don't want to spoil the story. But here is a snippet from Slaughterhouse Five and let me know if you see the resemblance. 'A man tells his story of how he became unstuck in time and abducted by aliens.' Slaughterhouse - FiveMorgan Freeman was right on. Worth a night at the movie. A little Romance so if you want to take a date who likes Sci-Fi by all means do.,8,3,7,18 April 2013
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The New Military Branch The Earth Army Corps
",I went in not expecting much and hoping to get a few chuckles and that is exactly what I got. The reason it is worth seeing is due to the quality of the actors. The screen play was weak and the story line never quite got off the ground. There were a few slapstick moments in the film that made me laugh. The script needs to be reworked and the movie redone. I just finished reading a WWII story where a young Lieutenant was standing in the middle of a road exposing himself to fire shouting for Germans to surrender. He then went into their midsts doing the same thing. I believe a total number just under 30 surrendered before he ran into one that could not be swayed by the Lieutenants charisma and was gunned down. There could be a better movie made on Psychological warfare with just as many laughs but made to be much more believable and fun to watch. So I don't recommend paying full price to see this movie and wait for it on Netflix.,3,6,15,15 November 2009
Kick-Ass," Wow
","I went in expecting to see something along the lines of Superbad. Superbad this movie was not. More like Leon The Professional meets Quinton Tarantino.I took both my daughter and son. One is early twenties and my daughter is a teen. They both loved it and said it was one of their favorite movies.It earned its R rating but it was fun, fun, fun.A big thumbs up for Kick Ass.There is nothing in this movie that romanticizes violence or that would encourage your child to take on a super hero personality. So don't fear. The characters are believable and this is destined to be a cult classic.",9,3,13,2 May 2010
Gran Torino," Wow what a screenplay!
",As a former vet and a current idealist I loved this film. You can look for the deeper meaning in this film or you can just enjoy the fine writing it is up to you. It works on both levels.Walt has lived his life by working hard and doing the right thing. What he has gotten in return is nothing. He has kids who never knowingly sacrifice and are to caught up in chasing the American dream they never truly learn what the American dream really is about. They never learn that if something isn't worth dying for then it is not worth living for either. You learn in this film that you live for one another not yourself. I was a little disappointed with the acting ability of some of the characters but the strong screenplay more than makes up for it.We need more Walt's in this world. We also need more kids like the Hmong family. We may suffer at the hands of others but life is given meaning in striving to make ourselves and those around us better. This nation was built on ideals and will survive by serving those ideals.,10,2,6,11 January 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," Zero Dark Thirty 5 out of 10
","Overly subtle trying to be overly cool. Slow film just like actual Police and Intelligence work. The cast was fantastic the character development was lousy. I wish they would have borrowed on some of the techniques used in Silence of the Lambs and the development of the Jodie Foster character. The Seal Team came with no credentials. I almost felt like that Osama was handed up to the Intel community as an offering. What were the Bona Fide's of this particular Seal Team? Great characters no Back Story. I loved the sets the realistic feel of the film. I loved the cast. I hated the writing. There were some strong points but very shallow character development. The actors deserve kudos for keeping me interested even with a boring script. Worth seeing if there is no good action movie alternative. I remember hearing the news and then dancing in the street. None of that in this movie. I felt cheated at the end of this film. Yes I support water boarding of terrorists. Yes Osama deserved to die. I loved the grocery store scene in the hurt locker. I loved watching the soldiers throw Horse Shoes it brought back memories. The plane in front of me crashed. Stake outs are frustrating, boring, and slow. This movie was frustrating and slow. Hire a better writer and try again. Use the same director and cast.",5,9,22,24 January 2013
