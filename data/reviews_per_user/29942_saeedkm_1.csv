Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Big Letdown
","This is certainly not a top of the league movie, I would not recommend this to a movie buff, and it definitely defies logic as to why so many people would vote to push it up the charts. It is quite scary cos i depend on IMDb for a lot of the feedback before seeing a movie, mediocrity should not influence the ratings for movies on a site as exhaustive as this.Borat...is a novel effort at the most, though i think he made a mess of an excellent opportunity with over the top humour that you have to strain hard to find funny.6 out of 10 for the effort. about 3000! if i were to rank it among greats.",6,2,5,27 November 2006
