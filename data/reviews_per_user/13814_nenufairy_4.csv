Your Name.," Overrated
","(NO SPOILERS IN THESE THREE PARAGRAPHS) The sweet love story(?) about a boy and a girl who wished to be someone else, and the wish did come true... but he has to save her first. Or something like that. The only problem is, they don't actually know each other, except by actually BEING each other in what they consider to be only episodic dreams-- I found this concept quite interesting.The art and animation were amazing, a lot was said about this already, and the guy (Makoto Shinkai) is a master in this, so I'll skip most of it; but I specially digged the final landscape scenes with pastel- colored skies and the trippy transportation scene. Amazing. Now for the plot. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, and maybe this movie was purposely made without much care for the actual plot in order to emphasize the amazing animation and crazy sci-fi elements, but I'm gonna give my honest impression:(-----SPOILERS AHEAD-----) I was very disappointed once I watched it and realized that all the hype for 'best animated movie of all times' was actually very untrue plotwise. It's just a collection of clichÃ©s and typical anime-like shoujo (un)romance. Wait, there were also several big plot drivers, all of them unnecessarily mashed together and none of them fully explained: -Body-swap. -Memory loss. -Time travel. -Meteor destroying a whole city. I felt like it was too much to handle for a young love story, and all of that load created a bunch of plot holes and nonsense I couldn't just ignore, e.g.: -How did the characters not notice it was a different year? I don't know about other people, but I hardly ever spend a day without something reminding me what year I'm in. -'Oh, that huuuuuge incident of a freaking meteorite destroying a whole town and killing everyone in it? Yeah, we all in adjacent cities (or the rest of the country, for that matter) just completely forgot everything about it'. -It's not like they could have just exchanged e-mail addresses sooner or anything, just to check if it really happened, right? Seriously, the whole thing would have been solved way sooner. -The father incident? How nice was it solved! He discovered the true value of her daughter and started to care more for her... I think... did he? - And for that respect... Not gonna lie, even if I were a super caring father, I wouldn't believe what this brat is blabbering, mainly because NOBODY ELSE ever noticed. Not even astronomists or w/e are the people in charge of noticing that kind of thing.Then, the characters were pretty normal, anime protagonists. Nothing too annoying or too special about them; that was good, I guess. Typical support characters. I would have liked a bit more love development before he went on to save her, it would have made me care more for his heroic adventure.All in all it wasn't an annoying film. It was a pretty film, it just wasn't a great one. Maybe for younger, more easily awed audiences, this could be the ultimate work of art, but I have seen this plot elements done individually tons of times and dozens of times better executed.",5,14,32,14 August 2017
Django Unchained," Good Tarantinoesque Entertainment
","I watched this movie knowing it was a movie by Quentin Tarantino, and what did I get? A Tarantino movie. I'm not his fan, nor do I despise any of his films in particular, but I've watched and heard enough to know what to expect from him. Thus, I didn't hope this one to be historically accurate, too logical or unexaggerated. That being said, what I got was: exciting, gory and even fun scenes, which managed to keep me awake past midnight during the almost 3 hours this film lasts. That alone is an achievement. Some of the actors were cast better than others(i.e.: Waltz>Foxx), but none of the performances were less than decent. The soundtrack was going really neat. However, I was truly disappointed by the rap/hip hop tracks. I'm all up for anachronisms and culture mixes when they fit the purpose, but these just didn't flow along with neither the scenes or the theme of the film itself. There were some weak points in the plot which turned me down a little bit (especially after the 2 hours mark), but the outcome, though predictable, makes up for it. All in all it is a very entertaining experience, all the more enjoyable when you are prepared on what you might get from this director... Also, I enjoyed his little cameo. I like how he adds fun where it seems unnecessary.",8,1,3,1 February 2016
Call Me by Your Name," Kinda pretentious and boring
","Elio (of 17), a young musician, starts exploring his sexuality and learning about love with his father's student, Oliver (visibly older), who's staying at Elio's family home in Italy for the season.
First of all, the good things. The score and soundtracks are beautiful, all of them either charming by themselves or fitting to the film's time and place. The overall acting feels natural and real, if you're part of an Italian family or have lived amongst them, you'll recognize the warm and homely vibes from their interactions. This feeling is also reinforced through the beautiful setting of the italian summer; the color palette and filters are all fitting too.So, what is it lacking? The actual plot is dull. Some scenes shine through and might add some meaning, but half the film is just filling: characters going to places, staying at places, having daily life interactions with each other, with very little dialogue through it all. A lot of it could have been cut off and it wouldn't matter. But, most importantly, the relationship between the leads had no real chemistry between them; we do see Elio sneaking glances and touching Oliver's stuff, but when did Oliver even start being attracted to Elio? And what about the girls? Why do they keep making passes at them if they're not into it? The conversations are scarce and don't help clarify anything either- not until the very end, at least. I do realize a more poetic, intellectually romantic sort of public might find their relationship more appealing, though. I'm pretty sure most of the really bad reviews (1 to 4 ratings) are because of the disappointment resulting from the high expectations its hype generated. Taking that aside, it's just a (seudo?)intellectual movie trying to display love and relationships in a natural setting, nothing much else happening. Nothing great, but nothing horrendous either.",5,30,79,25 May 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Am I supposed to take it seriously or not?
","I really don't know what the creators of this movie wanted the audience to think about it. It had an overall supposedly serious plot, but then you could find these random ridiculous moments during important parts of the story. They were really off-putting, not the kind of 'funny' you usually find in a good action movie.I'm not gonna complain about how violent and gory it was. I went to the movies to watch a cool action film and they sure did not fail to deliver. The fighting scenes were great, specially the infamous church scene, where you they got to try several different moves and their technical skills were on full display.It wasn't going bad at all (there even was a cute pug pup, points for that). Unfortunately, I had to take at least 3 points out just for the final sequences. I had let the McDonald's incident and other few slip, but the princess's response and the heads exploding like fireworks. The latter was simply awkward and disappointing. I'd call it entertaining but disappointing.",6,1,5,23 March 2016
