Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Outstanding
","I enjoyed this film very much.  I thought it was outstanding.  I even enjoyed the jokes for children.  It was the over all theme that captured my interest.  People have been criticizing the film,  there are many negative reviews out there.  Lets remember that they all opened to bad reviews.  We are no longer children, and that Lucas needed the first film to set up a vehicle for the following ones.Peoples expectations were and are incredibly high, which is certainly understandable seeing that we had to wait 16 years for this.  But what do you expect.  How can Lucas possible top and of the original 3? Particularly with a whole new set of characters not everyone is totally into yet?I don't want to give anything away yet, so I won't discuss the particulars of the film.  I feel that Lucas has outdone himself again.  I want to thank him for continuing to take the time to make outstanding films and put them in front of us.May the force be with you!!!",9,0,0,20 May 1999
