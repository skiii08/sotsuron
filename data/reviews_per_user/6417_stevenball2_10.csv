Men in Black 3," Jay and Kay Together Again
","Everyone is making such a big deal over Josh Brolin. He is good but it is Will Smith who carries the movie. He is in almost every scene. Adam Sandler take note: Will Smith has more facial expressions in one scene than you have shown in your entire 'body of work'. Plus he can do drama too. What this movie is lacking is a credible villain (Boris doesn't quite cut it) a credible sidekick (Griffin is very disappointing) & hot chicks (sorry Emma Thompson). The first 2 MIB had Linda Fiorentino & Lara Flynn Boyle who were hot. This episode also lacks Rip Torn, Frank the Pug & funny cameos like Michael Jackson, Martha Stewart & Peter Graves. What does this movie have? A boring time travel story to the '60's of all places. Bill Hader who is usually funny is NOT funny as Andy Warhol. You also have the 'Luke I am your father' sub plot. Totally unnecessary. In short while the special effects are OK the movie is just NOT funny. I hate to say it but not only is it NOT funny but it is boring too.",5,3,7,2 June 2012
This Is the End," James Franco makes a home movie.
","He invites some of his famous friends over for a house warming party & hilarious high jinks ensue. But only if you can understand the inside jokes & the endless references to their other movies and the Hollywood in crowd. Did you like Pineapple Express? Well here is a paradox of it halfway through. Do you like Jonah Hill, Seth Roggen, Danny McBride, Michael Cera, Chris Robinson, they are all here playing themselves. I presume the dialogue is mostly improvised. The photography is very dark & murky with that horrible sepia tone. The soundtrack is very disappointing (Back street Boys? Really?). Overall the movie is a horrible curio. Is it true it made 100K in release? I hope that doesn't mean there is a sequel planned.",1,4,8,21 October 2013
Just Go with It," Adam Sandler worst actor in the history of motion pictures
","Adam Sandler has no vocal inflection and no facial expressions. He is not remotely handsome yet over the years he has made movies with some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Jessica Biel, Salma Hayek, Kate Beckinsale,Drew Barrymore, etc and now Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer is a pretty girl even tho she is a woman in her mid-forties. In her 'love' scenes with Adam she plays as usual Rachel and Adam plays David Swimmer. It is really uncomfortable watching these two actors kiss and pretend they have actual feelings for each other. Everyone knows that in real life Jennifer wouldn't give Adam Sandler the time of day. Brad Pitt has very big shoes to fill. Also in this movie is Nicole Kidman who tries her hand at comedy.",Null,2,6,17 October 2011
Warrior," One of the best films of 2011
",Tom Hardy who is British & Joel Edgerton who is Australian play American brothers & their accents are flawless. Overall the acting in this movie is textbook perfect. If Nick Nolte doesn't get an Oscar nomination - there is no justice. While both lead actors are in their mid 30's & thus seem a little old for the punishing fight scenes - they do pull it off. I understand that both of them suffered injuries during filming. No matter they are both great in their performances. I've seen them separately in other films & they remain two actors worth keeping an eye on. I don't see them doing too many romantic comedies however. But maybe they will pleasantly surprise us in the future.,10,0,1,21 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," I hope they do the two other books too
",The two leads are perfectly cast. Daniel Craig & Rooney Mara are great. I hope they do the next two books as well. I haven't seen the three Swedish films so I haven't anything to compare the Fincher movie to. David Fincher is at the height of his powers. I don't understand how he was overlooked at the Oscars this year. It was a pleasant surprise to see Rooney Mara nominated in the best actress category. It was well deserved. There are a couple missteps in the casting department. Robin Wright is an actress of limited range and in this movie she has a terrible Swedish accent. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is usually pretty good but in this movie he isn't that good as the villain. The rest of the cast are merely OK. Thank God Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara are able to carry the film without having to depend on the supporting cast,10,2,7,7 April 2012
Bridesmaids," Wow this movie is really bad!
",I thought this was supposed to be the female version of Hangover. Like Hangover it made a ton of money at the box office. And like Hangover there will probably be a sequel or two. But the similarity ends there. Whig & Rudolf are from SNL and this feels like one very very long SNL skit. Ms. Whig is on her way to becoming the next Adam Sandler. I can't believe this movie received Academy Award nominations and a movie like Drive didn't (well maybe one for sound). Melissa McCarthy is very strange and because she is so different from most of the comedy actors working today she is very watchable. You never know what she might do next. I get the impression she will do anything for a laugh. A good example is the sink scene in the upscale wedding shop. When she hosted SNL she also took a lot of chances. I hope she starts to get better material in the future.,1,8,14,1 April 2012
Drive," Is Ryan Gosling the new Ryan Reynalds?
",Or is he the new Josh Hartnett? Is Carey Mulligan the new Mia Farrow? She seems miscast since in the trivia notes it says the character was originally Hispanic. There are no sex scenes in Drive but there are plenty of scenes of violence. Plus a few car chases. The pacing is deliberately slow & moody. This is a movie that knows it's a movie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. The dialogue is minimal. The direction is minimalist. The music is subliminal. The night photography is washed out & watered down. This is not the kind of movie you might enjoy. It is the kind of movie which will be showed in film schools for future auteurs. A study in neo-noir.,10,3,6,1 February 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Matt Damon and Minnie Driver - Together Again
",Matt & Minnie broke up as a team after GOOD WILL HUNTING. I never expected to see them again in a movie together. But here they are in a hybrid genre (part sci-fi part chick flick). Minnie is great as usual. Matt is starting to look a little chubby. He looks like Tom Hanks younger brother. I loved him in Team America: World Police. Here it's kind of a wash. IMDb says the movie had a budget of 50M. Judging from what you see on the screen they must have spent the money on hats & funny notebooks (ipads?) There are no special effects that I can see. What you see are Matt & Minnie running around NYC followed by cameras. It gets very tiresome. The dialogue is mumbo jumbo. Poor Terence Stamp - he keeps getting all the crappy parts Malcolm McDowell turns down. Don't waste your money but if you do - ask for your money back. It's not even worth the price of a rental,1,1,3,9 June 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," It's a Christmas movie folks - isn't it obvious?
","A Christmas movie without Christmas music, thank God. I am surprised that not many people have mentioned the pervasive Christmas theme throughout the film. There are Christmas decorations everywhere, Christmas presents, and most of all Christmas trees. I gave up counting how many scenes have a Christmas tree in them even in the prostitute's shabby apartment. I am sure there is a graduate student somewhere who could write a dissertation on the symbolism. I am not qualified to remark on what Kubrick was going for but because he used so much of it - it must mean something. Right? It is not blatantly religious more of the traditional Christmas commercialism. The things I like most about this movie were a.) the acting b.) the sets (except for the fake New York City street sets. Tom & Nicole made at least three movies together & this is by far the best of their collaborations.",10,5,10,27 July 2012
The Social Network," This movie is over rated
","The writing, the acting, the music, the bad lighting. All over rated. The opening scene is the worst and it doesn't get better. I usually like Jesse Eisenberg but he is totally unlikeable in this acting assignment. I usually like Trent Reznor but this score is merely annoying. I've never liked Sorkin or the West Wing but I do like Fincher and this movie does resemble some of his earlier films like The Fight Club. If Inception loses Best Picture it will be the biggest robbery since Avatar lost to The Hurt Locker. None of these people seem real. Zuckerberg should sue. These are all cut out cardboard characters.",1,61,117,17 January 2011
