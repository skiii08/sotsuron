E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," It reminds you of your childhood.
","I like the part where the boys take ET home on their bikes.This wonderful scene evokes the memory of my childhood activities with my friends.In fact, at the beginning, I didn't like ET very much physically, but the innocence of the child moved me.

Zootopia," Good
","The story is formal, but the idea is that the children look at it and the adults look at it. It's a story about minority, stereotype and acceptance.

Shutter Island," A wonderful movieÃ°Å¸ËœËœ definitely worth seeing
","Most of the wonderful film plot twists and turns, but I said that this film is not a wonderful exaggeration of the plot, but behind the plot revealed the reflection of human nature.The most controversial thing in the film should be whether the male protagonist has mental illness, about which there are many big gods who speculate that he suffers from mental illness.To me, it's more likely that he's not crazy.If he is not crazy, it is equivalent to the whole incident to repeat, this is how attractive thing!And at the same time, the possibility that he's really crazy will keep ringing in your head, and can you feel the inexplicable feeling?In fact, I want to say much more than that.But words do not say much, can not be passed on, can only be understood.",9,0,0,19 March 2020

Forrest Gump," If this is not love, where is the true love?
","There is no bondage, no demand for return, in love with each other at the same time can withstand his or her betrayal and escape. This is true love.It is easy to love someone, but it is very difficult to bear the so-called pain as Forrest Gump does, because these are not love, more like proof of self-worth.The fool of South Alabama, Forrest Gump, finally married Jenny and gave birth to a little Forrest Gump. They live happily together. At the end of the film, when Forrest Gump stands in front of Jenny's grave and says in a South Alabama accent, 'I love you, Jenny.' It was in our eyes that tears flashed in our eyes, not because the fool finally married Jenny, but because the fool had feelings that many smart people did not have: love. And those who think they have love do not get love, nor do they know what love is.",8,1,1,29 March 2020
