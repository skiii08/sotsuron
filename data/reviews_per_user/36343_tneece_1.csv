Resident Evil: Afterlife," Wow, this sucked
","I am a big fan of the Resident Evil movies, but Afterlife was beyond boring, awful, predictable, & too much like the Matrix. I own the other 3 films, so naturally I went out and bought Afterlife on DVD before seeing it. What a waste of money, even worse I can't return it. My wife and I both watched it and both were extremely bored. Too bad, now when they do the last film (hopefully it will be the last film). I will rent it from Redbox for $1.00, before I would ever consider buying it. You guys really messed up on this one!!!! Do it right or don't make a movie. Period. Even the actors in the film, weren't even good in the movie.",1,2,6,31 December 2010
