The New World," Beautiful visuals, bad editing
","I could have loved this movie...... The poetry and swirling imagery was intensely beautiful and I love that kind of thing. I felt like I was in a dream. But whoever edited this movie needs to find another career...and fast! I was so agitated by the end of the movie I was ready to smash the DVD. The story bounced from here to there then everywhere else and I had to keep rewinding it to catch the actual story. What was the editor thinking??? Was the editor rushed or just didn't care? Were they told to cut the time down at the detriment of the movie? If the editing were as good as the visuals, this movie would be a certain 10. I feel that this movie has gone to waste with all the work and beauty put into it only to end up a mess like this.",5,5,7,15 February 2008
