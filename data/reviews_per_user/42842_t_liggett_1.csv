Blade Runner 2049," Probably too cerebral for many viewers
","It's not the original movie, and I don't think its supposed to be. With that in mind, Villeneuve still does an excellent job of recreating the magic that captured so many sci-fi fans long ago in the original movie. A masterpiece of cinematography, visually stunning sets, intricate in detail, and vast. It's everything the original was but with a new twist, a slightly different flavor, new characters (and old), and with a soundtrack almost as haunting as Vangelis' original score. Even if you don't enjoy the film's plot you can't help but be astounded by it's beauty. So many of the scenes in this film are beyond words. I often wondered what was real and what was CGI and how in the Hell did they make it look so good. Eye candy! I'm sure there will be plenty of critics of this film (what piece of art doesn't have its critics?). And I suspect that like the original, this film will live on as a must see for true connoisseurs of dystopian noir sci-fi cinema. For me, the film works on so many levels. The casting was excellent, and I felt like everyone turned in solid performances. I can't recall a single scene in this movie that should have been cut. Some would complain that the movie is too long or moves to slow. Well, I submit that this is the same batch of folks that enjoy Micheal Bay films, fast food, facebook and texting. That's not meant to be an insult. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I prefer a director to take his/her time in telling me a story and so I felt the pace was perfectly adequate. For me the story line was interesting, plausible and had depth in layers. Consequently, I think this is where the movie may loose some of its audience. Some folks are not content to watch a film and be challenged with questions. They prefer to be entertained on a less cerebral level. It might well be that Blade Runner and now Blade Runner 2049 ask too much of some viewers. Too many questions that are too hard to answer? Yes, just like the original, this movie is bleak, and it doesn't paint a very pretty picture of humanity or the road we may well be taking. Issues that have and still do plague humanity abound in this film. Slavery, race, ethical dilemmas, societal woes, the environment and unrestrained industrialization are all characters in this film. They play an important part in telling an age old story: love. Love of mankind, love of a child, love of a parent, romantic love, and even how we define love. Interestingly, one of the most compassionate, empathetic, and loving characters in the story is a program/hologram. Maybe what this film is really asking us to do is to spread a little more love. I can't speak for others, but I can say that I don't mind having some important questions thrown at me in a film. I like a gimps of a beautiful yet disturbing future where the human spirit can claw its way from the depraved depths of bondage and suffering and triumph over greed and arrogance. Where AI can teach us a lesson in humanity and where good can overcome evil with love.",9,6,11,9 October 2017
