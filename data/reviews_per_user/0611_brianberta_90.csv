Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Makes the original look like a masterpiece
","When movie sequels are released, the common audience and critics consensus is usually that the sequel isn't as good as the original. Some sequels are pretty good but most people view the original as the better movie when compared to each other. I have seen very few sequels which are widely considered to be better than the original. Sadly, this is a case where the sequel to an already bad movie is so horrible that it makes the original one look like a masterpiece.The Bride is back and she is continuing her quest for vengeance. In the previous film, she killed Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii. In this movie, she must kill Bill's brother Budd, Elle, and Bill. Many things happen during her quest and she faces many life threatening situations so killing them proves to be quite a difficult task.My first issue with this movie is that it contains many pointless scenes which drag the movie out even more. The movie could've been cut down a lot more if these scenes were removed. While it's nice to see her training montage and the massacre on the day of the wedding rehearsal, these scenes slow the movie down and they only show things that I have already been made aware of or am not interested in learning about. I wanted to get back to the main action and I didn't want to keep on seeing pointless interruptions which I found to be uninteresting.Another huge problem with the film is that it has much more talking and less action than the first film. Volume 1 was much more fast paced and it had more scenes of action and fighting. However, since the pacing in this movie is much slower, it makes it harder for fans of the original who became use to its fast pacing to get into this one and become engaged. Come to think of it, I don't think that Kill Bill ever needed to be divided up into 2 parts anyways. It should've just been one movie and it would've been a better film as a result since it would fix the problems with the pacing from the 2nd movie.Also, the main villain (Bill) feels very one-note and is very dull. Even though David Carradine gives a magnificent performance, I didn't like his character at all. He also gets some of the most stupid lines in the film including a theory that The Bride is a killer on the inside and that she wears her more mature self as a disguise similar to Superman (because as we all know, soldiers are destined to kill people for the rest of their lives since they once did it on the frontlines). One thing that I really hate about the film is that the more interesting characters are killed off first. Elle is easily the best character in the movie since she has the most personality. Also, Budd's trailer home provides a great atmosphere with gorgeous cinematography and his performance is filled with charisma. I wished that the film was more about them then some crazy psychopath and a one-note main villain. I guess the moral to this movie is that the more interesting your character is, the quicker you are killed off.Also, the ending to this film is an enormous disaster and I could not feel any form of enjoyment after the movie ended regardless how hard I tried. One of my complaints with the first film was that the fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii didn't contain much swordplay and had more instances of them standing around and talking. I didn't think that the final fight could be any worse in this film, but it is. It is even more drawn out and there is even less fighting between them then there was in the original film. There were a few scenes when Bill shot her with a dart and held her at gunpoint, but those scenes really didn't contain any fighting so I was just waiting for those scenes to end so that the movie could get to the actual swordplay between them. Also, what makes the ending even worse is that when she reunites with her daughter after so long, I couldn't feel any sympathy for her whatsoever as I thought that she would make a horrible mother based on what she did (this is something she even admits to by saying that she can never live a normal life). Throughout the 2 films, she chopped numerous people's body parts off, killed a mother in front of her daughter, ripped someone's eyeball out and stepped on it, slammed a doctor's head between a door until he died, and many other things too. Because of this, it makes the film's ending harder to swallow and take seriously as a happy ending.The film is a little less sadistic than the first film, but it still contains a fair amount of sadism. Examples of it include someone's eye being pulled out and stepped on, a man getting bitten by a snake over and over again and dying a painful death because of it, and a blind woman running around and screaming in agony. Because of these scenes, the film feels very crass as a result and I wish that Tarantino would just grow up already and use violence maturely and not just for the sake of it.In conclusion, this movie is a disaster and it should be avoided at all costs. It does have some good things to it such as great acting, some of the action is pretty good, and, while maybe a little less impressive, the cinematography is pretty good in some scenes (mainly the scenes which take place in the desert). However, these few flaws don't even come close to overshadowing the numerous flaws it has with pointless scenes, pacing issues, unlikeable characters, a horrible ending, and sadism. This film is completely garbage.",2,0,3,19 December 2015
Vertigo," A very well-made crime drama
","'Citizen Kane' held the #1 spot on Sight & Sounds' 'Best films of all time' lists for 5 decades. On top of that, it and 'The Godfather' tend to be the 2 go-to films that moviegoers usually pick for the greatest film ever made. In 2012, however, Sight & Sound made the controversial and infamous choice of finally giving another movie its throne. That movie was Alfred Hitchcock's classic, crime film, 'Vertigo'. I'm not sure if I would rank 'Vertigo' that high. However, it's still a very good film and it deserves recognition for a lot of reasons.After a police detective named John Ferguson causes the death of a police officer due to his acrophobia during a rooftop chase, he retires from that job. He is soon hired by a former college acquaintance of his to keep an eye on his wife, because he fears that she might commit suicide as she believes that she is possessed.Around the 80 minute mark, it seemed like the movie was about to end. It seemed as if the climax came to be, and the viewer thought that they knew what kind of film it was going to be. However, the viewer becomes shocked to find out that the film is continuing on. The viewer wonders: 'What else do they have left to do?'. At first, I thought that the movie was going to lose steam as the final third is, admittedly, a little bit slower than the rest of the film. However, the dream sequence gave me a feeling that I was not wasting my time. It interested me a lot, and I was curious to find out how the movie was going to end. This all led up to a shocking and unexpected ending which left a strong impact on me. The plot twist at the end made the film a lot better, and it encouraged me to watch the film again as I wondered how the movie was going to feel on a 2nd viewing.Looking back at the movie, I noticed how John's acrophobia wasn't present in that many scenes. It was only present a few times in the movie. At first, I thought that it was a bit underutilized. However, after I thought more about how the plot twist at the end effected the film before it, I came to a conclusion that it did not have to be used more than it was. John did not have acrophobia, because Hitchcock simply wanted to add it in for suspense. It was put in the movie as it was essential for the movie's ending to work. If it were to be used any more times in the film, it would've started to feel redundant. Hitchcock did all of the primary tasks with that element without overdoing it.The acting in this film was really good. James Stewart as John Ferguson did a good job as the lead performance. His performance was pretty solid all around. He provided all the emotions and reactions which were required for his role. Nothing more and nothing less. Kim Novak gave a really great performance as well. She played 2 characters who each had different personalities. When she was Madeleine Elster, she played a woman who looked hopeless and terrified. She was able to do it without sounding annoying or over-the-top. When she played Judy Barton, her role seemed more meaty and strong. She did a good job transitioning between both of these characters. As the movie continued on, I started to notice some subtlety in her performance. She clearly stole the show. They were great as the 2 main leads. I had no particular issues with any of the other actors and actresses.The film is also pretty to look at. Views of the city and the streets are gorgeous. Some of the shots show dozens upon dozens of buildings. Those shots are overwhelming. Also, some of the other shots in different places around the city look nice as well such as the art museum and the graveyard. Also, it's hard to forget the opening scene where 3 of the characters were running across the rooftops with the evening sky in the background. Also, there's the haunting camera-work in the dream sequence which gives out an unsettling presence. Out of all of Hitchcock's films that I've seen so far, I like the cinematography in this film the most.In conclusion, this was a well-acted and well-shot crime film which had a very memorable storyline and ending. Is it the best film of all time though? I wouldn't say so. There are deeper films than this one. 'Citizen Kane' also has more layers to it and it's a more influential and important film. Also, I enjoyed 'Rear Window' a little more than this one. However, this is still a really great film. I can understand why a lot of people like it. It's one of the best Hitchcock films that I've seen so far.",10,2,4,29 August 2016
Come and See," The most effective anti-war film ever made
","Come and See is clearly the most powerful and violent anti-war film ever made.After a boy finds an old rifle, he decides to enter WW2. However, he finds that it is much more horrifying than he imagined and he experiences the horrors of it.What really makes this film so violent is that a mostly young cast is experiencing and acting in this. This movie has some of the most powerful massacre sequences ever put on screen. Rape is often described as forcing someone to have sex in cinema. But this movie doesn't need to be graphic in order to be powerful. In this movie, it is seen as hate-fueled violence being committed against other people. Unlike other movies, you cannot imagine the women in Come and See ever healing from their scars.This movie's ending is up for interpretation. It can be interpreted many ways. Viewed certain ways, it can be seen as one of the most powerful scenes in all of cinema history. It's great how it's open up for interpretation but I honestly wish that it made it more clear what its ending meant. Its ending was too thin. Movies don't need to make everything 100% clear but they should at least give clues so it doesn't leave the audience scratching their heads.Going off topic for a bit, whoever thinks that this movie contains propaganda are clearly prejudiced against this movie simply because it was produced in the Soviet Union. Those people are the same ones who wouldn't raise a single finger if this was produced in their country. If you still think that this film is propaganda then you need to watch it with a far more critical eye. Propaganda films should make war look like fun. They should make people want to join the war. They should glorify the acts of killing and ridicule of the enemy. Kubrick even made a parody of this in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. There was probably much more propaganda in 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan then there was in this entire movie which is nearly 2 ½ hours long. Come and See makes your stomach turn every second. It makes you feel disgusted just at the thought of war. It is by far the most effective anti-war film ever made.So in conclusion, this movie is the most effective anti-war film of all time. Its ending is a bit too thin for my taste but everything else in the movie is masterly done. It displays some of the most powerful massacre scenes in cinema and it handles violence expertly.",10,5,6,13 June 2015
Scarface," This is an okay movie but it is pretty overrated
","The Godfather, The Godfather Part 2, Pulp Fiction, and Goodfellas are usually called some of the greatest gangster films ever made. However, Scarface also gets a lot of praise from the audience and it is often compared to them and sometimes it is even considered to be the best film from the genre. I disagree.Tony Montana, a Cuban criminal, slowly takes over a drug cartel as he slowly succumbs to greed and eventually goes mad with power.Firstly, this movie does have its positives. Firstly, the acting is great. Al Pacino does a great performance here and his acting gets more unnerving as he gets more greedy as the film goes on. The other actors gave a good performance too but Al Pacino did the best job. It's not as groundbreaking as his performance in The Godfather Part 2 but it is still great on its own. The score is very memorable and fitting also.Also, the final 20 minutes are very well-done. It shows how Tony's fortunes and wealth begin to collapse in on itself and he finally gets what's coming to him. The gun battle at the end is masterfully done. It contains a very quotable line of dialogue and it is executed very well. And by the time the end result comes, it is certain to make your jaw drop. Also, the other couple shootout scenes are very stylized and well-done too.However, this is why I think that it isn't as good as other movies from the genre.The longer a movie is, the more likely it will run into pacing issues. Being 170 minutes long, Scarface does in fact have pacing issues and it doesn't have the same perfect pacing that The Godfather did. The issue with its pacing is that it takes a while for them to set up Tony's character and it also takes a while for his personality to change in the movie.Also, I found this movie to be very bland. Sure, it picks up in the last 20 minutes but there isn't a whole lot of action going on beforehand. I mentioned that this movie has pacing issues and those issues can often make it feel very boring. Not much exciting or interesting events go on in it. Several scenes should've been shortened or removed altogether.But despite what I said, this is not a bad movie. It does have its flaws but I'd say that it has a little more good things about it than there are bad things. This is entertaining if you don't mind bland movies and the slow-pacing. I just don't think that it's as good as other highly-praised movies (which I listed earlier) from the same genre.",5,2,5,29 August 2015
Requiem for a Dream," A horrifying but honest look at drug use
","I found Requiem For a Dream to be much more scarier than most modern horror movies nowadays. It is probably one of the most horrifying horror movies created. This movie details how 4 people have their lives ruined as a result of repeated drug use. The film shows how their actions affect their lives. This is a movie where you can't watch it a second time. It has nothing to do with its quality but the reason is because you don't know if you can put yourself through another viewing of it. What makes this film so horrifying is that the events that are detailed can actually happen and they have happened before. The first 2/3 of this are bearable but near the end, it gets highly frightening as it shows how their actions effected them. The acting is magnificent. All main characters give strong performances which allow us to get more immersed in certain parts of it. Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely did amazing performances and Marlon Waynes was a shocker in such a serious role. Sara (played by Ellyn Burnstyn) is the saddest character who we feel sorry for the most. She plays someone who gets addicted to diet pills her doctor prescribes. I felt sorry for the rest of the characters but I felt sorry for Sara much more. This film must be watched by everyone. Not just for its frightening imagery but for its educational value. In school, we've been told 'don't do drugs' several times in but in order to know how truly frightening the consequences of drug use can be, you need to watch this film. It's hard to watch but it will stick with you long after viewing it. This is by far the most powerful anti-drug film ever made.",8,1,2,13 June 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," An incredibly suspenseful film
","A really great tactic for beginner filmmakers to have is to be able to do so much with so little. In 'Buried' (2010), the entire film was shot in a coffin, and for the most part, one actor was on screen. Despite this, the film turned out to be amazing. '10 Cloverfield Lane' mostly took place in a bunker, and there were 3 on screen actors for the most part. This film made full use of what it had to work with, and the film we got was a brilliant, tense thriller which had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.After a woman named Michelle wakes up in a bunker, she is told by 2 other men named Howard and Emmett that the world has ended due to a chemical attack, and that they need to stay down there until its safe to go outside again. Howard is the owner of the bunker, and he is the one who saved Michelle from the car accident. Emmett was someone who knew of the bunker Howard made, and he let him go inside it. Emmett also broke his arm while trying to get in. As the days go by, the owner of the bunker, Howard, begins to act unstable, and Michelle realizes that she has to escape at all costs.Suspense is a great thing for a film to have as it can get someone super engaged in what's going on in the film. This film completely nails it on suspense. The outbursts that Howard undergoes are frightening, and I kept on thinking that he was going to pop in almost every scene with him. Also, one scene was so tense that my whole body tensed up when I watched it in the theaters. I was expecting Howard to pop, and I was on edge as it looked like he came so close to losing it. The scene concluded on something so unexpected that there was a huge sequence of positive reactions I had with it after it ended. That was the shining star for what the movie had to offer in terms of its wide selection of suspense.However, I think that the biggest reason why the movie works so good in terms of suspense is because of how great the acting performances are. John Goodman (Howard) did the best job by far. He was frightening every time he entered on screen, and he had convincing reactions with his outbursts. Since most of the films suspense was centered around Howard's outbursts, it could have lost a lot of its impact if his performance was played by another actor. However, he was able to carry the movie excellently, and he made the film have a far greater impact than what it normally would've had.The other actors did a great job as well. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) played a strong, female character. She clearly undergoes a significant change by the time the ending comes along. This is made most clear by the ending. She delivers her lines with effort, and her emotions sound very realistic. John Gallagher Jr. sort of played a neutral character. He tried to assist Michelle, and it showed that he was just trying to get along with Howard. He seemed a bit easy-going, and it was nice to have a calm personality in the movie. The personalities of all 3 of the lead actors vary plentifully.The biggest complaint people have with this film is its ending. I, too, was a bit letdown when I saw it in the theater. However, after I talked to a few people about it, one person I talked to changed my mind, and he convinced me that it actually compliments the movie pretty well. Just because the aliens aren't seen at any other point in the film doesn't make it any less of an alien invasion movie. The purpose of the final act is to give birth to a standard female hero. After she defeats the alien at the end, it is shown that she becomes this type of character due to her experience overcoming Howard. It's sort of like Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise. This is why she chooses to help fight the aliens instead of traveling to Baton Rogue to be evacuated. This film essentially takes a standard alien invasion plot and tells it in a different way to generate a different kind of film which is not seen that often in today's horror films. Sure, the tone drastically changes, but I still think that it's a really good ending.In conclusion, I cannot think of anything I disliked about this film. It seemed to hit every note perfectly. I think that 'Cloverfield' was a pretty good monster film, but this one completely blows it out of the water. Considering how much it entertained me, this has potential to be one of, if not my favorite movie of the year. If you are getting tired of horror films and if you find them to be repetitive, I strongly recommend seeing this one as it is a lot more original than most horror films I've seen. It is the rare case where a sequel is way better than the original.",8,1,4,9 June 2016
Lone Survivor," An underrated war movie
","This is an underrated war film by Peter Berg which deserves much more credit. It contains well-done battle sequences and it keeps the viewer hoping for a happy ending even though the outcome is already known.4 Navy SEALs on a mission to find a high-level Taliban operative find themselves in a desperate gun battle with enemy forces in the Hindu Kush region.Like Black Hawk Down, this is a movie which puts you in the middle of combat and it immerses you well. It isn't as claustrophobic and tense as Black Hawk Down was but it still does a great job in immersing you. The make-up work is bloody realistic and it shows you how all 4 men slowly become weaker and weaker as the battles they face continue on and on. Black Hawk Down didn't have this feature but I still think that it was more tense. I'll explain why I think that later in this review.Mark Wahlberg did a great job acting. His performance isn't too impressive at first but after the movie starts to pick up, he gives it all he has and he does an exceptional job in the second half. All of the other actors give great performances as well but Wahlberg is the one who stands out the most considering that he's the main star of the movie.I mentioned earlier that this movie has a lot of tension (which is does). However, perhaps 'Lone Survivor' wasn't exactly the best title they could have come up with. After the other 3 men die, I felt that the movie lost some of its suspense because I knew that Wahlberg wouldn't die and I felt more calm in the battle scenes which came after it. I know that some people already knew the ending since this was based on a true story but I wasn't familiar with the main story and I would've felt more tension if there was a different title.Even though this movie loses some of its tension near the end, I still think that this is an underrated war movie and it deserves a lot more praise. Some people have argued that it has intensity not seen in a Hollywood war movie ever since Black Hawk Down. I kind of agree with this statement. However, this movie still has well-executed battle scenes which are definitely worthy of a viewing. In my opinion, this is one of the best war movies of the past 15 years.",7,1,2,1 September 2015
Se7en," One of the best crime thrillers ever made
","This is one of the most horrifying movies ever made. But it doesn't just consist of violence. It has amazing performances, tense scenes, and a nail-biting finale which you won't ever forget for a very long time.2 detectives try to hunt down a psychopath as he kills people in grotesque ways based around the seven deadly sins.This movie contains several memorable scenes which have the tendency to knock you off guard. Besides the ending, another amazing scene is when they investigate the sloth victim. The gore is amazing but we get the jumpscare of our lives in it. I'm not going to spoil it though because otherwise I'll ruin it. Many people will agree that the ending is the best part by far. It is tense and suspenseful and it is completely unpredictable. It is one of the most memorable movie endings by far.Also, the acting is amazing also. In my opinion, Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt both give one of their best performances yet. Morgan Freeman's also gives as amazing performance and it is rivaled only by his performance in The Shawshank Redemption.The acting worked real well because this movie did a great job with its choice of casting. Fincher probably looked at previous works of Freeman, Pitt, and Spacey's roles and he knew that they would be perfect for these roles and his casting choices really paid off.As much I want to give this movie a 10, there are a few scenes which I felt carried on a bit too long or were more slower-paced than the rest of the movie. There weren't too much that bothered me too an extensive degree though. However, I do think that this would've been a masterpiece if it weren't for those few scenes.Nobody thought much of Fincher when he directed Alien 3 and he was originally dismissed as just another style over substance director. However, he looked at the mistakes that movie made and he showed moviegoers with this movie that he is a talented director. Since then, he has made several more amazing movies (especially Fight Club) and he is now one of the more appreciated directors working today.In conclusion, Se7en is a near perfect movie. Sure, the pacing can be a bit slow at times but this is still an amazing crime drama and I think that this is one of the best crime movies ever made. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time and it contains one of the best finales to a movie ever. I understand why some people disliked this movie but none of the reasons affect my opinion of this movie and I think that it is a must-watch for everyone as long as you don't mind realistic violence and gore.",8,2,3,30 August 2015
The Big Lebowski," Contains a unique plot
","When this film first came out, it didn't do that well at the box office and it received mixed reviews. However, over the years, it has not only acquired a huge cult following, but it has also had many books written about it, analyzing the philosophy in the movie. This seems a bit confusing at first sight because 'The Big Lebowski' seems like a mediocre comedy film at first sight. However, is it possible that it has a deeper meaning?The movie centers around a man who calls himself The Dude who is an unemployed loser who aims very low in life and doesn't do much. All he wants to do in life is to continue living the way he does and to go bowling. However, one day when he is mistaken for a millionaire by 2 thugs, he gets involved with multiple characters as it becomes possible that the quiet lifestyle he enjoys living may be over.Why does this film work so well in the first place? It has a ton of scenes which could be cut from the movie that wouldn't effect its plot whatsoever. Examples of these scenes include the dream sequences, the talk with the cop, Donny's death, and Maude's attempt to become pregnant with The Dude. Also, half of the conversations seemed to drag on very long and some of the ones which last a few minutes could be summarized in a few lines. Finally, most of its sub-plots have no conclusion to them. Examples include the kid who stole The Dude's car, The Dude's rug being stolen, and the outcome of Maude's attempt to become pregnant. However, the biggest unconcluded sub-plot in the film is the bowling tournament that was hyped up for such a long time throughout the whole movie, only for the film to drop the ball and go nowhere near it. While probably all other films which do this would be dismissed as pure garbage, this one somehow gets away with it. The question remains: why is that so? In 'Burn After Reading', another Coen's brothers film, its plot was sort of similar as all the buildup in the movie led to nothing. However, what makes this film more unique than that movie is that it didn't even have much of a buildup for its scenes in the first place. Most of the situations and sub-plots in this film stop before they even get going with them or have a chance for the film to explore those sub-plots. Most other films would get despised if they did this. In fact, some people do despise this as it sets them up for disappointment if they became interested in a particular sub-plot.However, what I find so interesting about these sub-plots is how they tie in together with the character of The Dude. The Dude is sort of a loser who doesn't do much with his life. He has no job, he always wears shabby clothing, and it appears that all that matters to him in life is remaining the way he is and going bowling with his 2 bowling buddies. The reason why it doesn't matter to us what happens in these situations is because it doesn't matter that much to him. That's not to say that he doesn't care at all when these situations happen as he does show that he has a moral center. He tries to defend himself so he doesn't get injured or killed by other people, and he also shows concern when Bunny Lebowski gets kidnapped and is in danger of getting killed. However, it also seems that he just wants to live comfortably (even as a lazy, jobless loser) and only worry about himself instead of others or what others want to do to him. The film shows that he only has a moral center when something bad might happen to him or other people around him. Obviously, he doesn't offer the world much, but he also doesn't harm other people. He keeps his goals and standards pretty low and he is a loser, but he doesn't mind being a loser. This is the thing which holds the movie together.Now that I've talked about its plot for a bit, I want to briefly talk about other aspects to the story that I liked. Firstly, the acting is pretty great. Jeff Bridges as The Dude does a great job as the leading role. The dull attitude of The Dude in the film is greatly represented by the dull, but lovable tone of voice that Jeff Bridges shows. Also, John Goodman gives a great performance as Walter. His performance also has some of the charm that Jeff Bridges brought to the screen. Both of them carry the movie excellently as their performances help carry home what the deeper meaning of the movie is. Also, the 2 dream sequences are highly imaginative as much as they are visually intriguing. They're my favorite part of the movie as they are creative, and some of the bizarre imagery in them is actually kind of funny due to the creativity that they have.In conclusion, I'd say that this film is a masterpiece just because it has accomplished something that no other movie I can think of has accomplished in the same way as this one. It tells an original story that has never been done before, and its plot is filled with creativity. Obviously, some people won't like how it doesn't conclude most of its sub-plots so it's not for everyone, but I can appreciate it for its uniqueness and creativity. On top of the unique plot, the acting and dream sequences are also pretty good. I recommend this film to all fans of cinema. If you are able to look over the fact that most of the sub-plots have no conclusion, you are in for a fantastic experience that has never been done before. Also, it will probably remain unique for dozens of years.",9,1,3,19 February 2016
Fight Club," I'm probably breaking rule 1 since I'm talking about Fight Club but this movie's so great, I can't resist talking about it.
","This movie is about a troubled man who meets a stranger and they decide to open up an underground boxing club which eventually grows out of control. The movie is dark and unorthodox. The brutality helps drive the movie and it shows how a simple fighting group can go out of control and take a dramatic turn. It has a surprising twist ending which will knock you out cold. It was very surprising and I liked the choice it made. The movie gives clues throughout the movie that most if not all people would miss the first viewings which leaves room for re-watching it. Every time I give it another viewing, there is always something new to be found. Many people might turn away when they see the brutality but it didn't bother me. What makes this movie so special is that it dared to go where no film has ever attempted to go before and that's what makes it so special. I think that this is one of the best movies of the 90's. Its creativity can inspire hours of discussing and it will be a film which will probably age well.",7,0,1,28 March 2015
Citizen Kane," Cinema can't get much better than this
","It is not hard to see why this is considered to be one of cinema's greatest movies ever made as this movie hits every element perfectly.After a wealthy newspaper tycoon dies, journalists scramble to find out the meaning of his last word 'Rosebud'. Then we see the history of his life and everything he encountered throughout it.The acting is magnificent. Especially coming from Orson Welles who in my opinion gave one of the best performances ever put on screen. But every other actor offers something great to the movie and not a single one of the main actors did a weak job acting. They all gave strong performances.Wells direction is terrific and he is able to use basic elements to craft something truly brilliant with this picture. His work behind the camera is immaculate and it brings the viewer into a truly special experience.This movie is engaging from the very first scene. Some people may not like the talk heavy dialogue but if you like slow paced movies (which I usually do) then it shouldn't bother you.This movie has stood the test of time. It has aged well and it shows no sign of losing popularity. Is it one of my favorite movies of all time? No, but the reason it gets a 10/10 is because of its impact on cinema and how much it contributed to it. The only American film which comes close to topping this masterpiece is 'The Godfather'.",8,4,6,31 May 2015
Inglourious Basterds," This has a great beginning with an okay buildup, but it fails miserably at the ending
","Many people nowadays will say that Quentin is a genius filmmaker who hasn't made anything bad before and all his films are masterpieces. But there is a small minority of people who say that while he is talented, he hasn't made anything fantastic for a while. This is probably his worst film by far.I'm actually very surprised at how much praise this movie has. As other reviewers have said, the beginning is the best part. This movie builds up pretty good. It was a bit too drawn out for me but it was still pretty good. I liked learning about what the characters were planning and it was pretty entertaining.But the ending was awful. It's way too fantastic and unbelievable. Especially Hitler's portrayal. The viewer cannot suspend disbelief at the unrealism. I respect liberties taken with history, but to create an ending which completely denies the actual historical events and brings the movie down to some mediocre cartoon: just mocks the viewer's intelligence.Also, I really hate the way that it portrays Hitler and his guards as morons and cowards. It's just laughable.This movies sadism is another major flaw. Quentin likes putting violence in his movies. It's fitting considering that WW2 was a brutal time period. But considering that the movie has a mostly straight face, Quentin takes it a bit too far. The movie shows cutting off the scalps of Nazi's, carving the swastika in their forehead, and showing Hitler getting shot 100 times even though he was probably dead after the first 5 shots.Diane Kruger and Christolph Waltz gave excellent performances but Brad Pitt was not even remotely believable the second at his entrance.I enjoyed 'Desperado' because it was in part a spoof and very entertaining. I disliked this one because it was too fanciful and unreal. I felt like it insulted me.",3,0,1,13 May 2015
Zootopia," A pretty great Disney film which has a fair amount of originality
","When this movie was released, movie goers' jaws dropped over its long lasting 100% rating on RT. It has since lost it, but when it had it, I grew a great interest in checking it out. After reviews were starting to come out, I heard some people say that it was one of the best Disney animated films ever made. That's when my curiosity flew off the radar. I needed to watch it to see if it really was as good as some people were saying it was.I think that it was a great movie. That's all I can really say for it.After a bunny named Judy Hopps fulfills her dreams of becoming the first bunny police officer in a large city called Zootopia, she partners up with a fox named Nick Wilde to search for an Otter's missing husband. As they discover more info about what should be a normal case, their investigation quickly develops into something much, much more...One thing that I really liked about this film was its comedy. A common complaint I have with animated films is that their jokes tend to be geared more towards younger kids. However, this film was actually very funny. This is probably the most I've laughed at an animated film in a long time. My parents and I were having a blast laughing at its jokes. My favorite scene from the film was the sloth scene. They did just about everything you could do with that scenes' set piece, and they made the most out of it. Also, I liked the scene where they made references to multiple Disney films by changing their titles slightly and putting in an animals name into it. If I get this on DVD, I'll make sure to pause it at that scene so I can read all of them. I also liked the gang scene with Mr. Big. The punchline wasn't exactly the most original one they could've used, but I still chuckled quite a bit at it. The only thing they could have done to improve it was by putting in a 'The Godfather' reference.I feel like this film went on for just the right length. It didn't seem too long, nor too short. At first, I thought that it was going to end too quickly and make the same mistake that 'Big Hero 6' did. However, I was gladly proved wrong, and my concern was quickly nullified. The final half hour helped to make its pacing and length hit just the right note.I feel like the most impressive aspect of the movie was its social commentary of today's racism involving Muslims. This was represented by how the animals discriminated against meat eaters. I can't think of a single animated film which has displayed social commentary before. I was pretty impressed with how they handled it. The symbolism was pretty creative. The reveal of meat eaters being targets resulting in a discrimination of meat eaters in the film can be a metaphor for how 9/11 led to the discrimination that Muslims face today. I really loved how it had the guts to hide such a horrifying day in it. Also, its racism was well hidden into the film. Racism is a pretty hard concept to symbolize without having it become obvious. However, they successfully did it without making it feel obvious. I thought about the film a lot to come up with my interpretation. I have to give the director a lot of credit for accomplishing that.With all the praise I've given it, it seems like this is well deserving of a 10/10 rating. I can safely say that it could have easily been one, but a choice they made really bugged me a lot throughout the film. My complaint was that Judy's relationship with Nick was very predictable, and I was able to correctly predict what would happen concerning them. The very minute that Judy started working with Nick, someone who she was mad at near the beginning of the film, I was instantly able to predict that the movie was going to have them slowly become friends throughout the movie as they spend more time together. I was also able to predict that just as their friendship would about to become official and complete, Judy was going to do something that would get Nick mad at her, and their friendship would be temporarily destroyed, only for them to make up right before the final act. Unfortunately, my prediction was completely correct. As I continued to watch the film, my prediction kept on looking more and more valid, and I was taken out of the film a few times as a result of this. It's quite a shame too, because this film sure had the potential to be a masterpiece.In conclusion, I thought that this was a pretty great movie. It definitely works very well in some aspects. In fact, it blew me away for doing some things differently or better than most animated films I've seen. It has quite a fair amount of originality to it. That could be a reason why some people love it so much. However, all I can say for it is that it was a great film. Nothing more. Nothing less. I would like Disney to use this film as a reference point though, and I think that they could make many better films in the future by taking a few pages out of this film. Is it one of the best Disney animated films ever made? No. However, is it a great film worth checking out? Yes.",6,3,8,27 May 2016
12 Monkeys," An outstanding time travel film which is never too overly-complicated
","Science Fiction has always been my favorite movie genre. I love seeing the imagination in movies of the genre and many of my favorite films are science fiction movies. This movie has everything which I think is mandatory in time travel movies. It has a great plot which gets you interested in its story line, it has great imagination, and a slightly complex story which requires a couple repeat viewings so you can understand and enjoy the movie more.In the year 1996, a deadly virus wipes out all humanity and the few survivors live underground to avoid becoming sick themselves. In hopes of finding a cure to the virus, a prisoner named James Cole is sent back in time in order to find a group of people called 'The Army of the Twelve Monkeys' who are believed to have started the virus. However, he is sent to the year 1990 by mistake and he meets a few people from that time period who may be able to help him complete his task.What makes this film so good is that while it can be complex at some times, it keeps you interested and it makes the viewer want to come back for more. The ending kept me thinking about what it meant long after viewing it and I wanted to watch it again after I watched it for my first time. Also, I did like it a lot more on my second viewing. The movie isn't really too complex up until the end, but it does feel a lot different on your second viewing. Also, the airport flashbacks keep on feeling more important every time they are shown. On your second viewing, they have a greater impact on you as you are already aware of what the purpose of them is.Also, the ending to this film is very well-done. I honestly did not expect that the film was going to end like how it did and it pleasantly surprised me. I'm sure that some were able to predict the ending if they paid close attention to the airport flashbacks, but I didn't notice it because the camera movements during those scenes were really disorienting. Also, the sequences are really hypnotic so it makes it kind of hard to get a clear view of what's happening. When I first watched the movie, I thought that the scene was meant to show numerous people dying from the outbreak since many other people in the background were laying on the floor.Also, the visuals and production design is up to notch. The unusual camera angles can be impressive at times at hiding big parts to the film (this works exceptionally well in the ending). There are also cleverly timed zooms which demonstrate how small and insignificant our protagonists are. Gilliam's execution in some of these scenes are perfect and they profoundly always win out. Also, the movie does a very great job with the scenes which take place in the future. The scenes which take place in the future feel very top notch and the set design looks high-tech enough to make you convinced that this is actually what the future will look like. Also, the scene where you see how the city above them looks abandoned is pretty good as it looks like the earth has actually been left to rot for several decades.The performances in Twelve Monkeys are all pretty well-done. Bruce Willis gives his finest performance yet as he displays sensitivity and emotional depth which is not only believable, but it makes the audience aware of his suffering and struggle to find a cure to the virus. Madeleine Stowe manages to show frenzy and energy in her performance without ever overcooking or overdoing it. Those 2 actors carried the movie excellently, but the actor who steals the show is Brad Pitt. He is amazing because he manages to play a convincingly insane and crazy role without ever seeming the slightest bit annoying and he never overacts or overstays his welcome.Of course, Twelve Monkeys is not for everyone and it isn't perfect. It may be too choppy or jumbled together for some people's tastes. Also, it may take a few viewings for you to be fully entertained by it. However, no movie is objectively perfect and it's easy to overlook these flaws if you run into them. If you're not too impressed with it on your first viewing, you should consider watching it a second time because if you do, you will be in for a great treat which is what happened to me when I re-watched it.In conclusion, Twelve Monkeys is an outstanding science fiction film which isn't too overly-complicated, but complicated enough to make your 2nd viewing of it feel a lot better and engaging. It also has great acting and great cinematography which convinces you that you are actually in the time periods that the movie takes place in. If you're a huge fan of Christopher Nolan or other complicated films, you will like this movie. There are very few things, if anything, wrong with it and in my opinion, it is one of the best films from the 90's.",9,1,2,16 January 2016
12 Angry Men," One of the most engaging and tense movies out there
","This debut feature is a gripping and engaging courtroom drama which is very effective. After I watched it once, I wanted to watch it again.A boy is accused of murdering his father. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room to determine whether he's innocent or guilty. Only 1 of them thinks he's not guilty and he has to persuade the other men why he thinks so.I personally found this to be extremely amazing. The movie was able to keep my attention for the whole way through. It was interesting seeing the men say counter arguments back and forth. Also, 1 of the jurors appears to be a sadist who just wants the boy to be put to death regardless of what evidence he's presented with. In my opinion, he is the best character in the movie because his acting performance makes him a very convincing character.Speaking of the acting, it was strong on all parts. As I said, Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) gave the best performance in the movie. However, there are several more actors who did a great job as well. Jurors #8 (Henry Fonda) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney) gave exceptional performances and the other 9 jurors gave convincing performances also. I don't think that they could've given a much better performance.Also, I found the movie to be very easy to follow. It gives a brief explanation of its plot at the beginning so everyone knows what's going on right before the 12 jurors meet. Also, the movie was very well-written. The fictional murder case set up was well and it contained a lot of elaborate plot points to it which were brought up during the movie.I can see why this movie has gotten as much praise as it has now. It is one of the most engaging and tense movies I've ever seen. The tension doesn't really come from action like many other movies do. The tension comes from the arguments brought up and how the jurors behave. I just watched this movie yesterday and I already want to watch it again. So far, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and it might even had the ability to become my #1 favorite. I'll just wait and see.",9,0,1,28 September 2015
The Babadook," An outstanding work of horror
","Many of today's horror movies are garbage and have many problems. But this movie works on so many different levels. It's about a troubled family who finds a book called 'Mister Babadook'. After reading it, weird things go on and the kid starts believing that the monster is real. It was expertly shot and each scene sends fear down your spine. What really stands out is how great the editing was. It made us fear the night sequences in the movie and it was so terrifying that I had to pause the movie a few times in the last half hour. The story is also really powerful as it displays the characters emotions real well and it does a nice job setting up what they're going through. This movie has everything that many other modern horror films don't have. The horror genre might be dying out but this movie shows us that it's not completely gone. This movie is definitely up there with horror classics like 'The Shining' and 'The Exorcist'. Let's just hope that this brand of horror won't be dying out. Thank you to 'Jennifer Kent' for this brilliant work of art and hopefully we'll see more from her.",8,4,6,28 August 2015
The Prestige," An entertaining thriller but I've seen better films from Nolan
","This is a good movie as a whole but I feel that Nolan overdid it on the plot twists this time. In my opinion, Memento and Inception are much better films.2 rival stage magicians attempt to outdo one another by performing their magic show and trying to cause as much damage as possible to the other one's career after a tragic accident.The films score is just okay. It fits great with the movie but I didn't find it as listenable on its own. Its combination of notes and chords isn't anything new that we haven't seen before. I feel that its music is just sound effects which are choreographed well with the film.Nolan is known for his elaborate, non-linear movie plots. Here, he relied on plot twist after plot twist before the final major plot twist at the end. Although this made for some good scenes, I feel that he overdid it way too much. After 1 plot twist happens, it confuses you for a bit. But before you're able to catch your breath, the movie hits you with another plot twist and it makes you more frustrated. The movie does it several times during the movie. I was eventually able to understand its plot but I didn't have as much fun trying to figure it out as I did with Nolan's other movies. Also, you have to suspend a lot of disbelief at the ending. I felt like it was done just for the sake of it in this case.However, despite what I said, I do feel that this is a pretty good movie. It has great acting from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, great cinematography and lighting, and most of the film up to the end is thoroughly entertaining. It's really only the ending which truly upset me. So in conclusion, this is a nice film and all but I've personally seen better movies from Nolan.",5,2,4,26 August 2015
The Hateful Eight," I didn't mind the slow pacing at all
","Before I watched The Hateful Eight, I saw a lot of negative reviews. Many people were complaining that the first 2 hours were painfully slow and it remained very boring up until the final hour. I was pretty concerned after reading all of those reviews and I was afraid that Quentin Tarantino would repeat the same mistake he made in Death Proof again. Hastily, I decided to watch this movie and hope for the best. I can safely say that I am very thankful that I watched this movie.In order to take shelter from a blizzard, a group of people take shelter in a small cabin and decide to wait the storm out there. Among them is a man taking a female criminal to town so she can be hung for her crimes, a bounty hunter transporting the bodies of 3 outlaws to Red Rock, an incoming sheriff also traveling to Red Rock, a quiet cowboy going to stay with his mother, a former Confederate general, and several others. As more info is revealed about the different people there, rivalries begin to appear and they start to grow bitter hatreds for each other. It becomes possible that none of them will make it out of the cabin alive by the time the snowstorm stops.For some reason, many people were complaining about the pacing. Sure, it does take a pretty long time for the gunfights to occur, but I found all the buildup to be exciting. I loved the sense of claustrophobia the movie provided and I felt that it provided a lot of suspense to the film. Also, the movie moved the story along nicely by slowly building up rivalries among the characters. It had several suspenseful scenes and the movie never felt boring because of this. I can understand why someone would get bored by the first 2 hours of the movie, but I didn't feel that at all. The movie kept me entertained from beginning to end. I feel that some people were expecting this film to have action from beginning to end.As Tarantino fans know, Tarantino often likes to put his plot lines out of order. This has worked great for many of his movies and it works even better for this movie. Often, at times, the audience knows something that the characters on-screen don't know and it results in some of the most suspenseful scenes in years. It is revealed at one point that someone poisoned the coffee and it leaves the audience to wonder who will drink it. It is also revealed at one point that a gun is hidden under the table and someone who knows about it sits by it. There are also a few other details in the film which make the flashback scene very tense. Because of the disjointed plot structure, it made me want to watch it again.Speaking of suspense, this movie sure contains a lot of it. In the final act, there are so many times when the characters come very close to getting killed and I become on the edge of my seat during them. As the movie approaches its end, I was fearing that something bad would happen to the characters I was rooting for at the very last second. My favorite scene in the film was when Bob plays quiet, relaxing songs on the piano while Warren taunts Smithers. The peacefulness of the piano combined with the arguments between Warren and Smithers creates a truly suspenseful scene for the ages.There isn't really that much character development in the film, but this didn't bother me at all because of the consistent feeling of claustrophobia and suspense. That distracted me from it so well that I didn't even notice it. Character development has been a problem in some of his other movies such as Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2, but this movie was actually able to engage me enough for me to not notice it.Tarantino has had issues with sadism in his past movies, but there actually isn't a whole lot of it in this film. I'd say that the only scene which bothered me was the scene when Warren forces someone to walk through the snow naked, do something very gross, and kills him. That scene didn't have to be as sadistic as it was and it felt very crass as a result. Besides this scene, however, nothing else in the film really bothered me. Also, that is an incredibly minor complaint. Some might find the scene when one of the characters (I won't spoil who) get hung to be overly-sadistic, but I really hated the character who died in that way and I felt it was a very fitting and deserved end. I was rooting for that person to be killed and I'm sure everyone else was.The cinematography is also pretty excellent in this film. Snowy landscapes are gorgeous to look at and the cabin provides an inviting and cozy feel to it. Also, the acting is very great. It gets better as the film goes on. Samuel L. Jackson steals the show and his acting role is very haunting due to how closer he gets to death as the movie goes on. Also, Tarantino's narration is actually pretty interesting and entertaining.In conclusion, this movie is amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better film. The slow pacing didn't bother me that much and I found the movie to be very suspenseful. It had some of the most tense movie scenes I've seen in years and the disjointed plot structure works better than ever. I understand why some people didn't care for this movie, but none of their reasons affect my opinion of the movie. If you're a fan of Tarantino then this is a definite must see. Just don't expect this to have action from beginning to end like many of his other films.",6,3,11,7 February 2016
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Brilliant
","In mine and many other people's opinions, I feel like Kubrick is one of the best directors of all time. He has made many films which are widely considered to be the best of their genre. 'Paths of Glory' (1957) is widely considered to be one of the best war films, '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) is widely considered to be one of the best sci-fi films, 'The Shining' (1980) is widely considered to be one of the best horror films, 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971) is widely considered to be one of the best violent films, and 'Dr. Strangelove' (1964) is widely considered to be one of the best comedies.After an insane general named 'Jack D. Ripper' triggers a plan to start a nuclear holocaust, a room full of generals and politicians desperately attempt to stop him before it's too late.Before watching this, one would not expect for it to be a comedy since it's about a nuclear holocaust, a serious topic. However, I was very impressed with how Stanley Kubrick went and did it anyways. I feel like this is actually a very good topic to make a film off of. With that being said, it succeeds on different aspects of comedy.One of the reasons why the comedy in this film works so good is how they get delayed so much. While President Merkin Muffley is warning Russia of the attacks, their conversation gets drawn out, and it makes the audience ask 'Shouldn't they be trying to hurry?' In most other films, this would be a flaw, but since this is a comedy, this can be excused as it represents more about the comedy. Another great scene is when the U.S. army tries to take over a base with Ripper inside in hopes of finding the recall code to get the planes to abort their mission. Kubrick takes advantage of every single way how this scene could be drawn out, and it leaves the audience laughing at how unlucky everyone is getting. I'm not going to spoil how this film ends, but it's a really great scene which uses this concept.Another great thing about this film is some of its dialogue. My favorite line from the film is: 'Gentlemen, you can't fight here! This is the war room!' It's a simple line, but it's very effective. Also, some of the one-liners kind of take into effect its comedy where it delays scenes. For example, the scene where Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson explains Ripper's plan to Merkin Muffley is full of many funny quotes like: 'Well sir, I would say that General Ripper has already invalidated that policy!'. Also, there is the classic ending quote.Finally, there are some jokes that you have to think about in order to get what they mean. Some of them are even left up to interpretation for what they mean. For example, the scene at the end where the Russian ambassador steps away from everyone, and does something with his watch takes a bit of thinking to determine what he's doing, and how that ties in with another scene. Also, the classic quote at the end: 'Mein Fuhrer, I can walk' has a ton of interpretations that can come from it. Another ambiguous joke is the increasing level of 'Alien Hand Syndrome' that Dr. Strangelove experiences throughout the film. Finally, there can even be discussion for what the title of the film, and its alternate title mean, and why Kubrick chose those 2 titles for the film.One thing I really like Kubrick for is how he tells simple, yet grand stories with his films. The comedy in this one represents that real well because the more I think about the comedy in this film, the more impressive and mind-blowing it seems.Another great thing I got to mention about this film is its great acting. It is actually very easy for me to decide who my favorite actor is in this film, and it seems like a very obvious choice. My favorite actor from this film was Peter Sellers. He plays 3 different characters (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove). I don't think that his performance was weak for any of these characters, and he gave a magnificent performance for all of them. However, my favorite character that he played was Dr. Strangelove. He is able to act in a weird and goofy tone without ever being annoying. It's hard for an actor to successfully accomplish this, but he did it exceptionally well. His other 2 roles were also great and believable as well. Without a doubt, he stole the show.While Sellers is clearly the best, that's not to say that there weren't any other actors who blew me away. In fact, if I could give almost equal credit to another actor who did a great job as well, it would be George C. Scott as General 'Buck' Turgidson. He also gave a convincing performance, and he stood out a lot as well. Other great actors include Slim Pickens as Major 'King' Kong for his consistent, upbeat attitude that he maintained throughout the film; even at times of despair, Sterling Hayden as Jack D. Ripper for his way of sounding like this was a real life, serious film; not a comedy film, and Peter Bull as Alexi de Sadesky because of the suspicious tone he had which unintentionally gave him some charm.In conclusion, this is another masterpiece in Kubrick's brilliant body of work. It hits numerous layers of comedy that can sometimes be pretty deep - this evokes Kubrick's talent of making simple, yet grand stories. Also, the acting is really good as well, especially coming from Sellers who played 3 roles exceptionally. It's no wonder why Kubrick is considered to be so good by his fans, and he continues to impress me even more every time I watch another one of his films.",9,4,6,10 April 2016
Alien," A classic sci-fi movie with a terrifying monster
","Ridley Scott delivers a movie that combines horror and sci-fi in such a way making it into a terrific classic film. The movie centers around a group of people answering a distress signal from a planet only to have an alien make it onto the ship and they have to kill it before it kills them. As soon as the Alien makes it on their ship, the film provides a tense ride as the crew is offed one by one. The acting was fine on all parts and the cgi was pretty good for the time. This might get boring for some people but fans of sci-fi and horror will most likely enjoy the film. Director Ridley Scott did a great job setting up a plausible environment. It is pretty realistic and it didn't take the path that most horror movies nowadays take. The lighting and camera effects make the alien look like one of the most terrifying cgi monsters of the decade. This movie took the original alien movie formula that most movies of the 50's and 60's took and spiced it up adding new elements. It takes a simple plot and it turns it into a masterpiece. If you are a fan of sci-fi and horror then this movie is for you. It's one of the best horror films ever made.",9,1,3,3 February 2015
Taxi Driver," Martin Scorsese's first masterpiece
","This was Martin Scorsese's first masterpiece and this was his first film which made him a famous director. It's about an insomniac taxi driver who works the late night shift because he can't sleep at night. It's a great character study showing him trying to fit back into everyday life. The cinematography is excellent and it shows the night life through the rear window of his taxi cab mirrors. The gradual transformation from man to beast in this movie is chilling. At first, he tries to kill a politician but then he turns his intention to a pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes. It's funny when he threatens himself in the mirror by saying 'You talking to me?' but when he comes out with sunglasses and a mohawk hairdo, it's clear that he's going to do something nasty. Robert De Niro's performance is fantastic. It's clearly De Niro's best performance to date. His acting is very intense and it helped him make an impression. The movie is enhanced by an excellent jazz soundtrack by composer Bernard Herrman which draws people into the movie. 'Taxi Driver' was a big hit when it first came out both by critics and moviegoers. It has been labeled as one of the best American films many times. This is a must see for all film lovers and it will likely age real well.",9,0,2,18 April 2015
Shutter Island," This may not rank with Scorcese's best works but I still enjoyed it.
","While this is nowhere near the quality of Scorsese's best films, Shutter Island is still able to make good use of its source material to make a haunting mystery thriller.2 detectives investigating a disappearance at a mental institution find that the island may be more than they imagined. They soon realize that there may not be a way off of the island and they might be killed if they continue to stay on it.Firstly, this is nowhere near the quality of some of Scorsese's best films. However, it still manages to provide enough to keep the viewer interested. Although the pacing is slow for the most part, it never feels boring at all and the movie keeps you engaged throughout. This is an ultimately soul-crushing and thought provoking film which you will constantly maintain a certain amount of suspense which doesn't get lost anytime soon in it.The acting is overall solid on all parts. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a great performance as always. It may not be one of his best performances but he is still able to play a convincing character. All the other actors give great performances as well but most of my attention was focused on DiCaprio as I felt that he was the only one I noticed and he was the only one who stood out to me.Scorsese tries to make an unpredictable plot twist but after Teddy Daniels starts questioning things, it's clear what direction the movie is going in and I wasn't as blown away by the plot twist as I was with other movies with great plot twists. I felt that Scorsese gave too many hints to it and some of them were too obvious. This is why I feel that this is a weaker film compared to his other works.I know that I've said this twice already but I'm going to say it one last time. This is a good movie but it is nothing compared to his other masterworks. The plot twist is hinted at too much and I wasn't completely blown away by it as I hoped I would be. However, this movie was able to keep my attention throughout and I would say that it's worth a watch. Just don't expect it to be anything special.",5,1,4,2 December 2015
Interstellar," An entertaining movie but not as good as some make it out to be
","Many people nowadays say that Nolan is one of the greatest directors ever and all of his movies are masterpieces. However, there is a smaller group of people who say that while Nolan is a talented director, he's not the film making genius that fans make him out to be. Interstellar is a prime example of this.After Earth faces extinction due to a dust bowl, 4 astronauts and an intelligent robot are sent into space in hopes of finding a planet suitable for life.Firstly, I'm going to talk about the positives. Many people say that the third act makes no sense but actually the science in it holds a lot of credibility. I'm not going to go into detail about it because then this review would be as long as the movie is. But I can assure you that it's not incorrect. Realism isn't necessary is sci-fi movies but when movies do feature them, it makes them more entertaining so I appreciate what Nolan has done.I really like the cgi. It is well-done and it immerses the viewer into certain scenes. Matthew McConaughey gave a great performance. It's not the greatest one ever like some people say but it's still pretty great. All of the other actors and actresses give good performances too but McConaughey did the best. Also, the ending was great too.Now I'm going to get to the negative points. Firstly, the movie has clear issues with the pacing. This is most noticeable in the beginning as many grew bored as we impatiently waited for the shuttle to leave Earth. This sequence felt slower compared to the rest of the film.Also, the movie has poor character development. That's not to say that there aren't characters you can connect with. In fact, Cooper's relationship with Murph is well- done but the same can't be said about his other offspring, Tom. He is seen as a secondary character and gets little attention from Cooper which seems unrealistic.People say that Zimmer's score is fantastic. I find it catchy but it's not as good as it's made out to be. Most of the songs consist of just one tune being repeated over and over again. Much of Zimmer's work lacks variety and Interstellar is a prime example of this. Also, it plays unnecessarily loud. It drowns out all of the other background noise. It took me out of the experience. In an interview, Nolan made the argument that it shakes the seats which is supposed to immerse you but the score still played louder than it need to be. It would've still shook the seats if it played quieter.Also, there's the endless exposition. Nolan had issues with this before but Interstellar is perhaps his worst offender yet. It bogs the audience down under many hypothetical theories so often that the movie runs the risk of feeling more like an educational video on scientific concepts than it does a work of entertainment. I wish that he would leave his films more ambiguous. That way, there would be more of a reason for me to revisit them.Also, the planet with the waves wasn't that important to the plot. It felt more like a side plot. It didn't have as much to do with the plot as the second one did. I wish that more time was spent on it.Another big problem I had with the film was that it used the annoying 'fake death' clichÃ© so often. This is when it seems like a character is about to die, only for them to come back to life. This was used in the tesseract scene. When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought 'It's so sad that Cooper's probably gong to die since his chances of survival are pretty much infinite.' However, after I saw that he still survived, and after I watched the movie a second time, the sad and suspenseful feelings that I originally had vanished. The tesseract scene does nothing for me anymore. In fact, it even annoys me.In conclusion, Interstellar is a bad movie. It may have some positive points and its ambition and thought shines through. However, don't be fooled by the 10/10 ratings. This is not one of the greatest movies ever made. This is mediocre. It doesn't come close when compared to 2001.",4,2,3,17 July 2015
Full Metal Jacket," One of Kubrick's best movies yet
","The first act is about a group of people training to be in the marine corps. Their drill instructor Lt. Lockhart, is really hard on them and his insults are actually quite funny. The first act was centered around Pvt. Joker and his experiences. As the scene continues on, one of the volunteers named Pvt. Pyle, is shown to be overweight and is often picked on by Lt. Lockhart. You can't help but to feel sorry for Pvt. Pyle and throughout the first act, you're hoping that he'll be able to turn himself around so he can pass. The ending of the scene was highly tragic but fitting. The second act showed that Pvt. Joker finished boot camp and was now in the Vietnam War. It showed him fighting through enemies as they advanced in the war. I don't think the second act was as good as the first act because the second act didn't draw me back in as much. Still I wouldn't describe the second act as bad because it was still entertaining. The scene when they are pinned down by a sniper is very tense. None of the fighting sequences carried on for too long and seemed to be just the right length. This is a very good movie so make sure you watch it.",9,0,1,3 February 2015
Forrest Gump," A good movie but it's not the masterpiece that many say it is
","This is a good movie for what it is but I really don't know why people say it's one of the best films ever made.Forrest Gump is not a smart man but he has accidentally been present at many historical events. While sitting on a park bench, he tells strangers about what he experienced in life and the people he met.The musical score is well-done and perfectly timed. It hits all the right notes at the right time. It does a great job drawing different emotions out of the audience.Also, I think that this is a very entertaining feel-good movie. It is also pretty compelling. It has a nice message as well. It's message is that you can achieve all you can in life. It can inspire many people and it does a great job doing what it wanted to do. However, then there are the flaws.Firstly, the movie often gets crippled under its own sentimentality. I get that the movie was trying to draw emotions out of the audience but it does it too often. Its sentimental moments can be real overwhelming at times. I'm not going to spoil anything but the ending seemed to exist just to add more unnecessary sentimentality to the movie.Also, this movie is overlong and stretched-out. It could've been cut down a lot. Several scenes I felt could've been cut down or could've been completely left out altogether. I grew bored several times throughout.In conclusion, this is a pretty good movie and I like it for what it is. I just don't think it's anything special like many people say it is.",5,1,1,12 August 2015
Léon: The Professional," A great action film with characters which I greatly cared for
","While many action movies tend to suffer from being style over substance, this movie provides just enough depth to make us care for the two main characters in this movie. Also, the plot has a few other changes added to it which makes it seem more interesting and original than many other action films of the genre.After a young girl's family is murdered, she meets a hit man who takes her in and the two bond over their time together as they develop an odd friendship with each other.One thing good about it is that it doesn't consist entirely of non-stop repetitive action scenes. Large portions of the film are focused on establishing the chemistry and bonding of the 2 leads: Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman). At the beginning of the movie, Mathilda's whole family is murdered. Though she didn't like most of her family, the death of her 4-year old brother has a negative impact on her as he was the only one in her family who she cared about. Her bonding with Leon is an interesting plot point as he was one of the only people who she really cared about. The time they spend together made me grow an attachment to them.Because of this slightly risky choice, however, some people argued that Leon was a pedophile and Mathilda's character was too overly-sexualized. To some extent, I could see why someone would think that, but there are reasons for this. Mathilda came from a broken home where she had a burning hatred towards most of her family members. Leon was one of the only people that she cared for. Also, since she was 12, she was probably just starting to go through puberty and was just starting to discover her sexual feelings towards others. She even admitted to Leon that she was (or thought she was) falling in love with him. Despite her efforts to flirt with him, Leon thankfully refused her attempts and he chose to love her more as a father than to actually share a romance with her. I don't agree with these arguments that much and I think that the movie handled that plot point in the most appropriate way it could.Also, the acting is really great in this film. Most people usually mention how Natalie Portman gave a fantastic performance and I agree with that. It's hard to find a really good child actor in most films, but she was exceptional in her role. Even though I felt like she was a little annoying at times, those few scenes did not break all of the other scenes she was in where she was able to show different emotions very convincingly. She was able to go from a frightened young child to someone capable of killing so convincingly, it makes her relationship with Leon more realistic and plausible.Jean Reno gave an intense and solid performance too. None of his lines were ever cringeworthy and his face conveys a great myriad of numerous emotions and great sensitivity which in a way, made the action scenes slightly better. He did a good job in the movie, but I don't think that enough credit is going to Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman as Stansfield gave an exceptional role as the villain. He is able to look threatening just at the sight of him. Every time he's on screen, you feel a sense of uneasiness and a sense that something bad is about to happen. In one of the scenes when he confronts Mathilda in the bathroom, that scene is very tense not just because of the most obvious reason, but because his performance gives the scene quite an unnerving feel to it. All 3 of them expertly carried the movie and I can't think of any other actors or actresses who would better fit their roles.Unfortunately, however, like many other action movies I've seen, I felt that one viewing was enough for me. At its core, it is a pretty genuine action movie and I felt like it didn't provide enough that made me want to revisit it for future viewings since I was already aware of what happened in it. My reason for this has a lot to do with the fact that I wasn't too engaged by its action scenes. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' has extremely absorbing action so I wanted to revisit that one after I watched it, but I can't say the same about this one. Is this point subjective? Yes, but I can't help the fact that I feel this way.In conclusion, this was a very great movie. I do feel like one viewing is enough for me, but that's not to say that it's a bad movie by any means. It contains original and interesting plot points, characters which I cared for, and outstanding acting performances for the 3 main leads. It is a great movie, and I'm glad that I checked it out. I can understand why so many people like this film.",8,1,1,31 January 2016
The Thing," A claustrophobic and grotesque cult classic
","The Thing is an intelligent blend of sci-fi and horror which is now a cult classic.This is about a group of scientists working in Antarctica. Eventually they find a husky which appears to be infected with something far sinister which begins to spread.The movie's main focus is its special effects. Despite the fact that they are over 30 years old, they still look just as grotesque and disturbing today as they did back in 1982. Because of the special effects, several scenes have become iconic. The most famous one being the chest defibrilator scene which was really unexpected.The movie shows us how the scientists quickly turn on each other after they discover that the thing can look like any one of them. The viewer keeps pointing fingers throughout the film and it's a surprise every time one of them is revealed to be infected. The movie's ending is ambiguous and it has inspired a lot of discussions and debates in social media sites. Its ending leaves plenty of room for re-watching the film to look for clues you might have missed your first viewing. I'm not going to spoil anything but it is quite a shocker.The tension is cranked up more since the characters are cut off from the outside world. This concept was borrowed by 'Alien' and it heavily influenced 'Aliens'. Unfortunately, this movie failed at the box office probably since it was released 2 weeks after 'E.T. The Extra Terrestrial'. But its great production choices with effects and concepts is what made it into a cult classic.",9,2,6,19 April 2015
The Revenant," Iñárritu has impressed me a second time
","When Alejandro González Iñárritu directed Birdman last year, he showed to moviegoers that he was a very talented filmmaker. That movie had so much art in it and it was quite a mind-blowing masterpiece. When I heard that he was directing this movie, it made me wonder: What is he going to do to impress us this time? The trailer for this movie looked amazing so I was very excited to see this movie. My anticipation definitely paid off for this movie and I loved every bit of it.A frontiersman named Hugh Glass is on a fur-trapping expedition deep in the forests of a territory of the Louisiana Purchase. After he is mauled by a bear, he is left for dead. He barely survives the attack and he sets out on a path of vengeance for the man who left him for dead.Emmanuel Lubezki is my favorite movie cinematographer. He has shot so many amazing movies and he puts a ton of effort into all of his work. The cinematography in this movie is also very great. The outdoor landscapes are beautiful and majestic to look at. The scenes in the forest and the snowy landscapes are breathtaking as well. Like 'Tree of Life', all of the scenes in this film were only shot in natural light. I could definitely see this movie winning an Oscar for Best Cinematography.Hugh Glass goes through a lot in this movie. He narrowly avoids getting killed by Indians, he is mauled by a bear and suffers from the damages days afterwards, he is forced to watch as someone (I'm not going to spoil and say who) dies while he is unable to help him, he falls off a waterfall in a desperate attempt to escape Indians, a horse he is riding falls off a cliff with him on it in an attempt to escape enemies, and so much more. His character is really beaten up throughout the movie and he has to do a lot of intense things to stay alive. As the viewer, you cannot help but feel sorry for him for all that he went through. This is one of the few movies which doesn't need to provide character development as it is able to provide something which distracts you from it.The action in this movie is actually pretty impressive. Its use of long takes, expertise cuts and camera angles, and great visuals makes each of them stand out. When I first watched the movie, I was a little worried that it wasn't going to live up to my expectations, but I no longer felt that after the first 15 minutes of the movie. The fighting scene near the beginning was definitely the best one in this film. It did a great job at getting me into the movie. It was very impressive because it used many different camera techniques to make it always feel original from beginning to end. It was a great way to start the film. Also, all of the other action scenes are pretty good as well.Another big accomplishment in this film was that it depicted the characters, not as villains, but as another species trying to do whatever it takes to survive in the harsh environment. Their decisions and actions in the film aren't really guided on hatred and insecurity as much as they are guided on fearing what will happen to them if they don't do what they do. The final fight in the film gives us another viewpoint on the movie and it makes us speculate if Glass fighting Fitzgerald to the death is really worth it. Most of the violence from the movie comes as a result of self-defense. Even the character that comes closest to feeling like a villain (John Fitzgerald) is driven by fear rather than by hate. Also, the bear attack scene was the most realistic and intense animal attack I've ever seen in a movie and I don't think that it will be outdone for a very long time.The acting is really great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy do great jobs as the 2 main leads. There is actually very little dialogue spoken in the film. For most of the movie, the viewer becomes use to the environment and the viewer experiences what the characters are going through just by their facial expressions. Leonardo DiCaprio barely speaks anything in the entire middle section of the film. However, his performance is great just by his facial expressions. He shows to us how much pain his character is in and he is able to do it so great without saying much lines of dialogue. Hopefully, he finally gets an Oscar this year because that Oscar he has deserved for all of these years is long overdue. There is something about Tom Hardy's performance that I like so much, and I sometimes have a hard time explaining what it is. I feel that it has something to do with how his tone of voice. Every time when he opens his mouth, he always interests me and I become drawn to his performance. Both of them have a pretty good chance at winning an Oscar and I think that they both did the best this year by far.In conclusion, this movie is a visual masterpiece which has very interesting characters and intelligent action scenes. With all the praise I gave it in this review, it is not perfect because I feel that the middle of it could have had at least 15-20 minutes cut off of it, but that's my only complaint. Make sure you watch this film because you will definitely not be disappointed.",8,0,1,7 February 2016
The Shining," Terrifying and suspenseful, but predictable
","I'm not a fan of Stephen King but what Kubrick has done was strip away all the nonsense of the original novel and create a great film. However, despite my love for Kubrick, I still don't love it.After a writer and his family agrees to watch over the 'Overlook Hotel' for the winter, a haunting presence causes him to go slowly insane as the claustrophobia builds up around him.However, it, admittedly, does many things right. This movie doesn't rely on cheesy jumpscares and unnecessary gore that many other modern horror movies rely too heavily on. The Shining builds up its scare factor with suspense and claustrophobia. This leads up to terrifying and well-executed domestic violence which is done phenomenal thanks to Jack Nicholson's outstanding performance and the great execution of it. His great acting contributes to several great scenes especially the iconic 'Here's Johnny' one.Kubrick uses camera movements and techniques, sound design, disturbing visuals, lighting, colors, foreshadowing, and attention to detail to make this a truly frightening horror film which contains so much suspense. Also, the score is one of the most eeriest movie scores ever written because it contains sharp, high-pitched sounds, and it is perfectly timed throughout the movie.Sure, this movie did deviate from Stephen King's novel, but Kubrick expanded on the novel. It changed the things in the novel that didn't work that well and he changed them to make sure each aspect of it was as effective as possible.However, my issue with it is with the character arc. The second Wendy mentions how Jack injured their son while he was drunk, my anticipation quickly faded into disappointment. At that point, I had a feeling where Jack's character was going to headed right at the start. By the end of the film, there was nothing surprising about how he ended up. I wished that his character would have started out softer.While this film can be terrifying with its clever uses of suspense, claustrophobia, and frightening camera techniques, the character arc has always bugged me, and I don't like it as much as many other people do. I prefer character arcs to be unpredictable. I will always love Kubrick, but this movie was a miss for me.",9,0,2,8 August 2015
Warrior," A gripping sports movie with great emotional power
","The sports genre isn't exactly the best genre around. There are some classics like Rocky and Raging Bull but most modern ones seem to have the same problems. They reuse the same clichés, they barely feel original at all, and most of them are predictable from the very start. But every now and then, a good sports movie comes out. Million Dollar Baby was an inspirational movie with a shocking and heartbreaking finale and 42 was well-acted, well-written, and pretty original in terms of clichés. Then there's Warrior.After ex-marine Tommy Conlon returns home, his father trains him to enlist for SPARTA, the biggest wrestling event in martial arts history. But he finds out that he has to go up against his brother.This movie contains a simple plot which may not seem too impressive but the way its emotional power moves you is how impressive it is. Both brothers are damaged in their own way and we witness how they cope with their problems throughout the movie. At the end, they finally confront and face off in an unforgettable climax which will blow you away.This movie is made better by its terrific acting. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy both give terrific performances. Their performances are emotionally powerful and they engage the viewer to the movie's plot. Hardy may be known for playing Bane but he plays his performance in this movie much better. It's a shame that this isn't the movie which got him famous.As for the music, the score is really nothing special as it consists mostly of tunes we've already heard of but the soundtrack is the shining part to it. It contains a huge range of note and chords and it perfectly sets the mood for certain scenes. Some scenes like the ending wouldn't be as good without its soundtrack.As much as I'd like to call this movie a masterpiece, there is only one thing I didn't like about it. I didn't really feel that the military aspect was necessary for 1 reason. It wasn't really necessary for a sports movie given what was going on in it. It felt kind of out of place and it could've been left out. It served kind of as a distraction from the main plot also.So in conclusion, this is an amazing sports movie which shows that while the sports genre isn't as amazing as it once was, it's not completely long gone. This is an amazing movie. It could've been a masterpiece without the military aspect but it's still definitely worth a watch because of how well-written it is.",7,1,2,25 August 2015
The White Ribbon," Really good and interesting, but not great
","My initial response was that Haneke was exploring where the support for Nazism came from and how the treatment of many of the village kids helped to influence this movement. As the schoolteacher says, 'They could clarify some things that happened in this country'. After watching the film though, I looked up some interviews only to learn Haneke denied that this film says anything about Nazism/fascism, so I realized I had to amend my reading of the film. I then came to the conclusion that Haneke was more interesting in exploring the repressive social order of the village and its effect on its inhabitants. While I wouldn't say this is a great film, I'd definitely say it does a great job at painting a bleak portrait of the village, one which is a lot more nuanced and complex than one would expect from reading a summary of its themes.In the village, the father figures hold the most power, controlling their kids and sometimes even going against their wives. The baron lies at the top of this social order. He has a paternalistic attitude which he displays throughout the film and occasionally lectures to the villagers. Though he isn't popular, most of the villagers are dependent on him. Since he's the employer of half the village, he has the power to fire and refuse to provide work to all the members of a particular family, shown by what happens to the farmer and his family. The next prominent character is the Pastor, who ranges from strict puritanism, seen by how he restrains his son to his bed after he finds out that, to authoritarianism, shown with his physical punishments of his kids and even his wife, to a degree. The film's title comes from how he ties white ribbons to his kids to remind them of their innocence and purity, but this motif later symbolizes the oppressive constraints placed on the kids concerning how white ribbon is used to tie the pastor's son to a bed or how ribbon is placed over a kid's eyes after he's savagely beaten. In spite of this, the pastor shows middle ground given a couple tender scenes where he allows his youngest son to care for an injured bird or how he accepts his son's gift of a bird later in the film. Another prominent character is the farmer. While we get to see some of the control he has on his family, he primarily shows us what can happen to a family who gets on the baron's bad side and he reinforces the dependency the villagers have on him. The last prominent character is the doctor. Although you initially sympathize with him, he's later revealed to be emotionally abusive to his wife (and possibly towards his previous wife) and physically abusive to his daughter. Each of these father figures contribute to the film's themes in many different ways. Due to this, it's not easy to pick up on everything from a single viewing and it usually takes a few viewings to grasp everything which goes on.These father figures effect the children in a variety of ways, presumably causing them to carry out the acts of violence. The connection between these incidents are that they're caused by the repressive social order of the village. For instance, the farmer's son destroys the baron's cabbage field as he believes he was responsible for the death of his mother, leading to the other struggles his family undergoes throughout the film. The steward's son pushes the baron's son into the water as he was jealous of him for having a working flute (he likely had it due to his family's high position in the village) while he had trouble whittling one out of wood. The steward's violent confrontation with his son afterwards was the effect of that. It's likely that the acts we don't see are also carried out by the children. For instance, were the pastor's kids responsible for attacking the baron's son given how their Dad punished them in a similar way? Were the pastor's kids responsible for the rest of the incidents in the village concerning the conversation the schoolteacher has with the pastor at the end? The way the final act handles all these mysteries might disappoint some people, but I found the payoff to be quite unsettling. The schoolteacher's final narration stuck with me for a while after the film ended.With all that being said, I'm not sure why Haneke chose to make the schoolteacher the protagonist. Where does he fit into all of this? Considering how fleshed out and interesting many of the other characters in the film are and how much they add to the themes, the schoolteacher feels one-dimensional by comparison. His relationship with Eva, for instance, holds such little relevance towards the film's themes, save for an admittedly interesting visit to her family where we see that the repressive social order of the village occurs elsewhere. For the most part though, I thought he was kind of boring. I wasn't quite as bothered with his character the second time around, but he still acts as a detriment to the film and locks it firmly in the really good tier.In conclusion, I'd say this is an example of a film held back from greatness from one major issue which could've easily been fixed. In spite of that, the rest of it is truly excellent. I imagine I'll get more out of the film if I were to watch it again since there's so much to unpack from it in terms of all the character dynamics (I know I didn't say much about the steward). If you haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it.",7,1,2,4 April 2020
Aliens," Almost as good as the original
","It was hard to beat 'Alien'. It was an outstanding movie and I didn't expect this to be as good or better than it. It wasn't better, but it was still amazing. The movie has a huge buildup. It introduces the characters and the setting. When the team makes it into the shuttle, it is highly tense knowing that any one of them could be killed any second. The movie does a great job setting it up by making a dark and atmospheric environment. When they arrive at the planet, they encounter a little girl who's the only survivor and they rescue her. When the aliens show up, they kill several of the crew members and leave them stranded there. The second half of the film is an intense ride of action and death. Several of the characters in the movie have interesting personalities. The fight scenes are very tense and well done. Many other military movies use this movie as a guide to learn off of. I didn't feel the same amount of tension as I did with the first one, but it was still very good. The sequels that follow just try to cash in on the name and rarely bring anything new to the series. However, this sequel is, in my opinion, one of the best movie sequels out there.",7,0,1,29 October 2015
American History X," One of the most powerful films ever
",This is probably one of the deepest films made in years. Edward Norton made an incredible lead performance that drives the movie well. This film can be hard to watch at times and it may not be for everyone with its intense action and violence but the overall message of the movie is well thought out and is quite moving. Even the most violent of people can change as seen by Derek when he becomes friends with a black man when he was in prison. Behind all the violence lies a great message that is pretty motivational. Its plot details how black and white people despise each other and often get in fights and even kill each other. The movie details how brothers Derek and Danny both try to turn themselves around from their harsh life. All of their friends are racist and both of them fear their friends turning on them if they try to leave their gang. The ending is tragic and it's hard to watch. It gets me every time but it's fitting. This is a really amazing film. It has a great story and a great message. All of this combines to make one of the best movies in the 90's. As long as you can get by the gore and action then this will likely be a film for you. This is a must see film for all fans of drama movies.,8,2,5,3 February 2015
The Usual Suspects," An outstanding and gripping crime drama
","This is a very entertaining and well-thought out crime drama with a great plot twist.After a massive explosion on a ship leaves 27 dead, a police officer brings in the only suspect and begins interrogating him.Despite only having a 6 million dollar budget, this movie looks and feels better than most movies with much bigger budgets. This movie has an amazing cast (especially Kevin Spacey) and amazing plotting which keeps you guessing as more and more plot points appear.It's ending will knock you out cold. Some people said that they were able to predict it but that's only 1/2 of the plot twist. The other half of it was the fact that Verbal was reading off the bulletin board.However near the middle, the movie can get boring. Not much exciting events happens in it and it is slower than the rest of the film.Still this movie is pretty great. It has a cool plot twist and the movie leaves room for re-watching it. Overall, it's a pretty well- done crime drama.",6,0,1,21 July 2015
Legends of the Fall," A well-done and emotional drama and romance movie
","While this movie has a powerful story, it has flaws which bring it down but it's still a great movie nonetheless.This tale follows a family growing up in the early 1900's in the country. It details how they go through many different obstacles and how their lives are effected.This movie won an Oscar for 'Best Cinematography' in 1994. This movie does impress you with spectacular scenery and landscapes but that's the least this movie has to offer.Firstly, I do feel that this is a powerful story. It has a moving plot, several moving and emotional scenes, and great narration. It has the ability to move you. Although I feel that some scenes dragged on a bit too long, the movie was able to keep my attention for the most part. There were just a few scenes I grew bored in.The acting is really hit or miss. I didn't think it was absolutely terrible but it didn't impress me all too much either. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins were the only 2 actors who gave good performances in my opinion. The rest were either mediocre or bad performances. They weren't completely terrible like some low-budget movies but they just didn't impress me.I mentioned that the movie has great narration. But while it does, it still has the tendency to get a little cheesy at times. It doesn't happen too often but when it does, I can't help but cringe.So in conclusion, this is a pretty great movie. I appreciate it for what it is but like most movies, it's not without its flaws and it can get on your nerves too. However, I for one enjoyed this film. It was well-done and I felt a lot of emotions while watching it. I recommend it to other fans of the genre.",6,0,1,11 August 2015
No Country for Old Men," A brilliant deconstruction of the Western genre
","It was interesting how this film provided a modern take on the classic Western. It was also a really good one at that. Many scenes had a lot of tension to them, and it had a ton of unexpected moments. Then, at the 90 minute mark, the movie pulls the rug out from under the viewer, and it becomes a lot more interesting. This is the finest Coen brother film I've seen yet. In my opinion, it's even better than 'The Big Lebowski' - another masterpiece.After a hunter named Llewelyn Moss accidentally stumbles across a drug deal gone horribly wrong, and nearly 2 million dollars in a briefcase, a serial killer named Anton Chigurh follows him in and attempts to get it back, killing anyone who gets in his way. A bounty hunter named Carson Wells is also hired to recover the money. In the meantime, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell oversees the investigation. Violence and mayhem results.What I loved about Chigurh was that he was able to accomplish all of his tasks without ever showing much pain or effort. He did gruesome murders like it was no big deal. Since he never showed much emotions throughout the movie, this gave me the idea that he knew exactly what he was doing and he wasn't afraid of dying whatsoever. This made his appearance seem very threatening. Also, it was very hard to escape him. Very few people he encountered in the film made it out alive. Most of his victims stood no chance when he killed him. Also, his character was made a lot better by Javier Bardem's amazing performance. Without showing too much emotion, he was able to send a chill down the viewer's spine every time he enters the screen. He has an ominous feeling to him which makes his appearance look unnerving. Bardem terrifies the viewer somewhat in the same way that Anthony Hopkins' from 'The Silence of the Lambs' does. I don't think that many actors could do the same as him. What he did is very difficult to do, yet he nailed it perfectly. His Oscar for 'Best Actor' was well deserved. Also, many other actors such as Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones gave great performances as well.Also, this movie has several of the most suspenseful scenes I've ever seen in a film. For example, the coin toss near the middle is, by far, the best one in the film. Chigurh constantly stops all attempts the man in the convenient store does to escape. When he throws the coin, the viewer is left on the edge of their seats to see what will happen. Also, you probably didn't notice the gentle push-in from the camera which raises the tension even more. Another great scene is when Moss is in a hotel, and he suspects that Chigurh is right outside the door. Moss turns the lights out and points his gun at the door to prepare. The calm moments the viewer experiences keeps them on the edge of their seats, because anything can happen at any second. There are many other scenes where the Coen brothers add background noises which inform the viewer that something bad might happen. It could simply be the sound of footsteps, someone flushing a toilet, or a loud phone ring. It could also be when the viewer knows something that a character in the film doesn't. If a character is walking into a room, it could show you a shot to see Chigurh waited for him/her. This is another highly effective technique which works very well too. I can't think of a single movie I've ever watched which made me feel as much suspense as I did in this one.Around the 90 minute mark, the Coen brothers pull the rug out from under you, and they make a choice which makes the film a whole lot better. It is so unexpected, and it opens the film up to a whole new layer of pros after it leaves a few loose ends in its storyline, making it ambiguous. I am a real enthusiast for ambiguity. I think that it's great to have in films as it gives them more staying power, and it can lead me to discover new things every time I re-watch them. The ambiguous ending in this film seems simple at first. It doesn't seem too impressive at first glance. However, after thinking about it for a little while, I was slowly able to realize how impressive it actually was. It makes you see the film in an entirely new way, and it makes simple action scenes that we witnessed earlier in the film become much deeper. It was interesting how the Coens were able to provide a somewhat unique take on ambiguity. People who criticize its ending and call it disappointing are missing the point. This is a film which has a deeper meaning. It requires you to think. Just because it leaves a couple plot points up to interpretation doesn't make it a weaker film. Ambiguity isn't necessarily a bad thing.In conclusion, this was a perfect movie. Chigurh was an amazing villain. I feel like he's one of the best modern villains ever, because Javier Bardem knocked it out of the park with him. Also, his calm expressions were terrifying. Chigurh was reminiscent of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Also, I've felt more tension in this film than any other film I can think of off the top of my head. To top the film off, once the ambiguity is introduced, it allows the viewer to appreciate the film in entirely new ways, and the film becomes very different on re-watches. This is, quite possibly, the best Coen film to date.",9,1,1,8 July 2016
District 9," One of the best sci-fi movies of the 2000's.
","This is a great imaginative sci-fi classic that has an interesting twist on racism. The plot revolves around a group of aliens being isolated in South Africa. While trying to maintain them, one of the workers get infected and he starts to mutate into one of the aliens. He soon becomes the most wanted man on the planet and he's forced to retreat into the area where the aliens are being held. I enjoyed the movie more and more as it went on. It has great acting from Wilkus Van De Merwe. The cinematography was excellent and it was expertly shot. It has a nice barren and rundown environment. The action sequences are highly interesting since we get to see fictional weapons being used. They make them more entertaining. They are played well and last long but not too long where they start to drag on. This movie definitely taken inspiration from 80's sci-fi movies. It has just the right elements which make a classic sci-fi movie. It is an interesting depiction of aliens and the future and its originality shines through. This is one of the best sci-fi movies of the 2000's.",5,1,1,20 February 2015
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A flawed movie but it makes up for it by having great direction techniques
","Though long, this movie contains some pretty moving scenes and it's a great effort which retells the final months of Jesse James life. It's about a younger member of the notorious James Gang who becomes drawn to him but he soon fears him killing him and he thinks about doing the unthinkable. The soundtracks are moving and they're emotional and powerful. For a western, the actual gun-slinging is kept to a minimum as the movie focuses on the characters themselves. Dominik's direction is near flawless. He lingers long on shots and he captures the characters expressions and uneasiness. By using this style, he allows the characters to give near perfect performances. However, the film doesn't explore these concepts thoroughly and leaves it a bit too ambiguous. I don't like it when films spell everything out for me. Another feature the film lacks detail in is the female cast. They are insignificant and are reduced to mere cameos. When this played at the Venice film festival, it was 4 hours long. It was cut shorter since then but my issues with the length would probably be more bigger had it not been cut down. I don't think this movie is a masterpiece like many other people think but it's very close to one and it is rather underrated. If you like slower paced movies then this is for you.",8,1,1,26 April 2015
Non-Stop," Some parts of it worked, but many others didn't
","I think that Liam Neeson is a talented actor. However, I feel that he has just picked the wrong roles to star in most of the time. Most of the action films he has starred in are either average at best, mediocre, or bad. Sure, Schindler's List is a masterpiece. Also, The Grey, The Lego Movie, and a few of his other films are amazing. However, most of the films he stars in end up being average at best, mediocre, or very bad action thrillers. Non-Stop does a few things right, but it's ultimately brought down by a unbelievable final act and a seemingly incomplete terrorist plan which I felt needed more work.Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) plays a U.S. Air Marshall who is on a flight from New York City to London. During the flight, he gets a text message from someone on the plane who says that someone will die every 20 minutes unless he instructs the government to transfer $150 million into an off-shore account.Firstly, there are large aspects to this film that I like. The movie actually did a good job at keeping me guessing who the terrorist would be. The person who I thought would be the terrorist turned out not to be the one so the movie did a great job at hiding its plot twist at the end. In fact, I don't think that I would've ever successfully predicted who the terrorist would be even if I had all the time in the world to do so.Also, the movie does a great job building up the suspense. It starts off quiet, but the movie slowly picks up pace as more things are discovered about the plane and what the terrorists are going to do. Also, the fact that the passengers start to suspect Neeson of being the terrorist adds a whole other layer of suspense to the film. It gives us another thing in the film to be worried about.However, there are also large aspects to this film that didn't work.My biggest problem with the movie is the terrorist plan itself. Large parts of it were unexplained. Firstly, the movie didn't explain how the terrorists were able to hack Neeson's phone. Also, it wasn't explained how they were able to get a bomb through airport security onto the plane. Also, it wasn't explained how they were able to know that Neeson was smoking in the plane bathroom (they could've used a camera, but the movie didn't mention one at all). Finally, it wasn't explained what they used to drill a hole in the bathroom wall which enabled them to kill the pilot with a poison dart. These aren't necessarily plot holes, but the movie didn't explain how the terrorists were able to perform these parts of their plan so the movie seemed sort of incomplete in these parts.On top of the unexplained sections of the plan, there were also parts which seemed to rely on pure luck and coincidence. As for the first victim, how did they know that Liam Neeson would eventually kill the passenger in the fight they had. He could've just knocked him out or he could've just surrendered. Also, Liam Neeson could've been the one who was killed and their whole plan would've failed. As for the third victim, how did they know that Liam Neeson would pin him against the wall in the exact place where they hid the poison dart. He could've just pinned him down in the aisle or he could've pinned him against the wall in a different spot. The plan didn't seem that realistic and it didn't feel like any real terrorist would rely on luck based events and coincidences that small as was shown in the film.Also, the final act fell apart and seemed thoroughly unrealistic. The way they landed the plane basically defied all laws of physics and science. The final act needed work. On top of the unrealism from the final act, the reveal of who the terrorists were seemed like an abrupt way to end the film and it seemed like they couldn't find a better way to introduce the final plot twist and ending.In conclusion, this film has its strong parts and the first 2/3 of the film are pretty good since it keeps you guessing and it has a good amount of tension. However, there were still unexplained bits to the terrorist plan and a few luck based events which made the terrorists plan seem incomplete and unrealistic. You'll have to stretch your suspension of belief to the breaking point with this movie, but I can't say that this is one of the worst action films ever since it does do a few things right.",4,1,4,10 December 2015
Saving Private Ryan," The best WW2 movie
","'Saving Private Ryan' is the best WW2 film out there. It starts off with a memorable 25 minute opening sequence which is arguably the best scene in a Spielberg movie. It is highly realistic for its time and it's tense from beginning to end. At the end of the sequence, it shows you a dead soldier from the 'Ryan' family. Later we find out that 3 of the 4 members of his family died and Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and a group of 7 soldiers are sent to bring the remaining brother back to his family before he dies as well. With an unforgettable story, the plot is quite moving even just thinking about it. The movie was also expertly shot and acted. Every action scene is realistic as it is bloody. After soldiers are killed off, it makes the soldiers question if the mission is worth it and it often creates conflict with them. The final battle has a big buildup and carries on for just the right length.The ending is tragic and it gets me every time but its emotional resonance sticks with the viewer after watching it. This is one of the best films of the 90's due to its impact on the viewer.",8,2,3,4 February 2015
The Pianist," Fulfilled all of my expectations
","A very engaging and fantastically shot WW2 film which is one of Polanski's best films in years.This movie retells the events of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous Polish pianist as he attempts to survive during WW2 and narrowly escapes death multiple times.This movie may not be as brutal as 'Schindler's List' was but it still contains several dark scenes which can be hard to watch. It showed to us that surviving the Holocaust was based on luck and it was easy to get killed. If you were weaker and unable to work, you'd be in danger of getting shot. 'The Pianist' captures this element very well and that was what I really liked about it.This movie is pretty tense because his fate is uncertain throughout the movie. He often hides in Nazi infested areas and his allies have to try their hardest to hide him. Often when his cover is blown, he only narrowly escapes death. Also, one scene in the film (which I won't give away because of spoilers) is so tense that it is guaranteed to make everyone who is not familiar with the true story tense up unlike anything else.Also, I really love the cinematography. It really captures the sense of barrenness very well. Some of its scenes are so jaw-dropping, it's surprising that any movie could be able to film them. This movie is definitely a visual treat unlike anything else.Adrien Body gave a great performance. In the beginning, he seems somewhat calm. As the movie continues on, however, his performance gets better as the tension gets higher. In my opinion, he gave the best performance in the movie. He stole the whole show. He is the actor we see most in this movie and he carries the movie expertly by himself.In conclusion, this movie is by far a masterpiece. It contains everything I think is necessary is Holocaust films. It captures the brutality of the Holocaust very well, it has incredible cinematography, a consistent level of suspense, and it has a great lead acting performance. It fulfilled and went far beyond all of my expectations and it is a must-see film for these reasons.",8,0,0,7 November 2015
28 Days Later...," A chilling zombie film with a deeper meaning
","Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later' is my favorite zombie film by far. It may not be as popular as some of the other zombie classics out there, but I think it rises far above all of them. It's not only an entertaining and well-done zombie film, but a smart film which has a deeper meaning.After a group of animal activists release a chimpanzee with a dangerous virus, a zombie virus breaks out. 28 days after that incident, Jim, a bicycle courier, awakens from a coma only to have to fight for his survival along with a few other survivors he runs into.My favorite aspect of this film is its political allegories. Its political allegories give an example of what the government/military would do in a situation like this. Boyle is saying that if a zombie outbreak were to ever happen, the government, soldiers, and politicians would be safe in a bunker while the rest of the world would be left to fight for themselves. You could probably get some help from the army, but they may want to get rid of you or other people traveling with you. They might even have violent intentions towards the people they keep with them. The military soldiers we saw in this movie went to unsettling lengths. They tried to rape Selena and Hannah, killed their own soldiers for disagreeing with their actions, and, most importantly, kept one of their fellow soldiers who turned into a zombie alive and chained up so they could see how long it would take for him to starve (an action which resulted in their deaths). Also, the final scene is delightfully ambiguous, because it makes you wonder whether the military will even try to rescue anyone else.The character arcs of Jim and Selena are also impressive as the 2 of them appear to swap personalities over the course of the film. When we are first introduced to the characters, Jim appears to be terrified of the zombies while Selena seems like a strong, fearless female lead. After she kills Mark early on, she tells Jim that if he ever turns, she will kill him in a heartbeat. After they discover two more survivors named Frank and Hannah, Selena appears to show little interest for helping them. Over the course of the film, however, she slowly befriends and accept them. The most important aspect of her change, however, is how she slowly develops a relationship with Jim as she said she would never do so early on in the film. As for Jim, on the other hand, he changes from fearing the zombies to becoming increasingly violent throughout the film. His first instance of violence is when he kills a zombified boy. However, the most notable instance of violence is when he kills several military soldiers in the final act of the film. This shows that threats to his life or threats to other people he cares for can bring out his animalistic instincts. My favorite moment surrounding their character arcs is how Jim reunites with Selena after he kills Corporate Mitchell. The scene where he gouges Mitchell's eyes out with his fingers is probably the most gory scene from the film (or, at least, in my opinion it is). It shows how much the outbreak has effected him. The moment when he reunites with Selena is very interesting though. Early on in the film, Selena said that she would kill him in a heartbeat if he were to turn into a zombie. However, the fact that she refuses to kill him (even though she clearly thinks he's infected) shows that both hers and Jim's character arcs are complete. I think that what director Danny Boyle is saying here is that you may try to act a certain way if you're put in a situation like this. Over time, however, the apocalypse will gradually bring out your true colors to a point where they will eventually be uncontrollable.On top of its deeper meaning, I also found it to have several memorable and brilliant scenes. The first of which were its shots of a deserted London. I thought it was impressive that director Danny Boyle was able to make all of those highly populated areas of the city look deserted. From what I read, Boyle had the streets closed off at 4:00 am and sometimes had only a couple dozen minutes to film. Another great scene is when Jim kills all of the remaining soldiers in the bunker as this scene is both suspenseful, but, like I said above, it shows the character arcs of Jim and Selena at their finest. Also, the song 'In the House, In a Heartbeat' was well-written and memorable. It's one of my favorite soundtracks for a horror film. It fit the movie really well. Personally, I didn't have any major issues with this movie. I thought it was all masterfully done.In conclusion, this is one of my 10 favorite films from the 2000's, because of its deeper meaning. As I said, this is my favorite zombie film of all time (I even like it more than the original 'Night of the Living Dead', which I actually consider to be overrated). I thought its sequel '28 Weeks Later' was alright, but in my opinion, this movie is the best that particular genre of film is ever going to get. I strongly recommend it.",9,0,2,31 July 2017
City of God," A great movie with well-written characters and powerful scenes of violence
","City of God is a very violent, moving, and heartbreaking movie about gangs in the slums of Rio De Janeiro.This movie details how crime affects the people who live in the slums of Rio De Janeiro. Rocket has witnessed violence by both gangs and he wants out of it but he finds that he can't escape.This movie does a great job with making itself look violent. I think that the main reason why this movie is so hard to watch is because most of the violence is happening to kids. It can be hard to watch so many kids brutally die off so young in their lives. Slumdog Millionaire did this too but I think that this movie did it better because it displayed violence more brutally with greater buildup involved.The different backstories are all entertaining. They are violent, well-written, heartbreaking, and even a bit funny every now and then. They show us how all the tales are all connected to each other. This movie is non-linear because of that.Nowadays, it's hard to find a good child actor but many of the actors in this movie carried the movie with expertise. Most of them were unknown too which made their acting performances even more unexpectedly good.This movie gives nods to Quentin Tarantino by featuring techniques such as time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts. It drew inspiration from Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas but this is original in its own way. It has its own techniques which it featured throughout the film.In conclusion, this is a very well-done film. It's violent and it also has great characters and backstories. This isn't for people who are sensitive but it will appeal to you if you like violence in movies.",8,2,4,15 August 2015
Schindler's List," One of the best movies of all time
",This is pretty much Steven Spielberg's cinematic coming of age. It hits every element perfectly and it's a masterpiece. The movie is not afraid to be highly brutal and it does an amazing job showing us the ugliness of the concentration camps. All movies of this genre should not be afraid to have this element of brutality and Schindler's List does it perfectly. It does a great job making us care for Schindler and I can tell that Spielberg really cared for him and his actions. It's a very powerful film and the fact that this was based on a true story only strengthens the emotional power. The fact that it was shot in black and white undoubtedly gives it more power and emotion. Saying this movie was expertly shot would be an understatement. I've never seen a film shot better then this. This is a one of a kind film and we may never see it duplicated. It hits all the elements perfectly and succeeds in every way. This is one of the best movies of all time and it must be watched.,9,9,14,21 February 2015
The Elephant Man," A well-made and powerful film which could use some polishing
","David Lynch is a genius when it comes to the weird and absurd. He puts a lot of imagination into his films, and its interesting to see what he can do in each of them. Eraserhead was the 1st film that I saw from him. Over time, it grew on me to an extent to be my 4th favorite film of all time (currently). The Elephant Man was the 2nd film I watched from him. Even though its story is more grounded, it still manages to keep Lynch's absurdity feeling present found in most of his filmography.A Victorian surgeon named Frederick Treves rescues a horribly disfigured man named Joseph Merrick who's mistreated, and works as a side-show freak for a living. Behind his disturbing appearance is an intelligent person who Frederick begins to appreciate as they continue to spend more time together.Often, when movies contain bleak plots like this film or attempt to make the viewer feel sadness throughout them, it's very easy for them to be crippled by feeling overly emotionally manipulative. This can also easily hinder the viewer's immersion with the film their watching. For that reason, it seemed unlikely that this film would be able to succeed concerning the hopelessness of its plot. Despite that, however, Lynch was able to make one of the saddest films I've ever seen without making it feel overly sentimental or cheesy whatsoever. By firmly sticking to the facts of the true story this was based on, he did all that was required for him to do in order to make this film into a powerful experience. Also, we got to know more about John Merrick throughout the film as Lynch did a good job at developing his sensitivity and intelligence. This proved to be a highly powerful characteristic which made the film stand out so well. It makes many other feel-good films crumble into dust when compared to this one.The acting is another high point to the film. John Hurt as Joseph Merrick gave an amazing performance. Underneath all of the disturbing makeup, he is able to project humanity. Also, his voice was very muffled, like one would expect. Despite that, however, his voice was still understandable, and I was able to make out his voice without having to try too hard to listen or replay a line of dialogue. He stole the show. Also, Anthony Hopkins as Frederick Treves gave a great performance as well. He was able to convincingly play a doctor trying to help Merrick without ever sounding bland. Both of them did pretty good as the 2 main roles. I had no glaring issues with the rest of the cast.The visuals were pretty good. Since the movie was set in the last 1800's, the black and white seemed fitting, and it made sense for a movie set over 100 years ago to have black and white. Also, the make-up on John Hurt looked gross and realistic. To make it, Lynch looked at different photographs of the real Joseph Merrick. Also, after this film wasn't recognized at the Academy awards for its make-up effects, tons of people wrote angry letters to them, demanding them to give the film an award for Lynch's recreation of Joseph Merrick. They didn't do it, but they did create a new award called 'Best Makeup' with 'An American Werewolf in London' being the first to receive it. Since the effects inspired all of that to happen, I'd say that it did something right. Also, because of the black and white, the disturbing and realistic make-up effects on John Hurt managed to look gross without distracting me from the movie.When it comes to historical accuracy, this film isn't the most accurate film out there. It had several inaccuracies. Firstly, the events from the films famous railway station scene happened before Merrick stayed at the hospital. Secondly, the whole kidnapping sub-plot never happened. Merrick went to Europe on his own accords. Mr. Bytes, the original cruel owner of Joseph Merrick, never existed. Bytes was based off of Tom Norman. Thirdly, it's likely that Tom Norman was never as cruel as the movie made him out to be. Fourthly, Frederick Treves never had to rescue Joseph Merrick from Tom Norman. A few weeks after Joseph Merrick started working with Tom Norman, their exhibit was seen as 'distasteful', and it was shut down by the police. After that happened, Joseph and Tom went their separate ways. In addition, several operations were required to enable Joseph Merrick to talk. Finally, his first name was not 'John'. It was 'Joseph'.In conclusion, I enjoyed this film. It succeeds where many feel-good films fail at. It has great acting and gross and realistic effects made even better by the black and white cinematography. This may not be the most historically accurate film out there, and it may be a bit dull in a few places near the middle, but it's still pretty good. I'm going to check out more of Lynch's films in the future. People who aren't a fan of Lynch's work tend to agree that this one and The Straight Story are his best films as they prefer his more straightforward work. I think that this was pretty good as well. It just needed some polishing in a few areas.",9,3,5,13 July 2016
The Hurt Locker," A original and tense movie about the Iraq War
","This isn't on the same level as Black Hawk Down is but the Hurt Locker is still another thrilling, well-acted, and fairly original movie about the Iraq War which is definitely worth a watch.This movie follows 3 soldiers in the Iraq War. They are trained to disarm bombs and they face the threat of death every day as anyone could try to kill them as seen in the beginning of the movie.In most war films, armies face each other directly and battle. In this movie though, the enemy hides in plain sight and the soldiers have no way of knowing who can be trying to kill them. Often when they disarm bombs, several possibly dangerous people watch them and any one of them could try to kill them as is shown in the intro. This of course creates conflict between the troops and this movie explains some of the conflict that arises between them.The scenes where they disarm bombs are very tense because the viewer knows that the bombs could go off at any second. This is made clear from the memorable opening scene. The movie also brings in factors which helps to raise tension even more. It shows several possibly dangerous onlookers, a man driving a taxi within the bomb site, and a man holding a remote which may possibly set off the bombs. The shootout scene near the middle isn't that impressive compared to other scenes in the movie In terms of originality and suspense but it doesn't take up too much time to begin with.The acting is pretty good. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty were the main actors and they carried the movie well. They don't have too much of a variety in terms of their facial expressions and emotions but they still do their best in the movie and they show that they are talented actors.A common problem found in many war films is the lack of character development. Like many other movies of the genre, this movie also suffers from that problem. The movie doesn't give us something big which makes us care for any of the characters. This is a common problem which arises in many war films nowadays and I hope that it will be fixed sometime in the future.Despite the lack of character development, this is still a great war film which contains some pretty memorable and original scenes which hold a lot of tension often. It is definitely worth a watch and it is one of the better war films in recent memory.",7,0,1,17 September 2015
Pi," A very effective thriller
","I really like watching weird films. It's interesting to see all the imagination that Directors can put into their films. In fact, Eraserhead (1977) is one of my favorite films of all time. Seeing that Pi was a low budget debut film, I was curious what Aronofsky would be able to do with it, because I heard that it looked very good despite its budget. The film looked very good, and I found it to be a very interesting film.A paranoid mathematician named Max attempts to find a pattern in the Stock market which will also unlock the universal patterns found in nature. However, hallucinations continue to hinder his path and as the film continues on, it becomes more difficult to tell what's real and what isn't.Max goes through internal and external conflict in the film. His internal struggles are the hallucinations he experiences and the first phase of a deterioration of his body starting with a bump on his head. These symptoms often come into effect when he's at crucial points in his objective. If he's getting info from Lennie, he might have to rush home before it takes its toll on him. Also, if he's attempting to find the 216 digit number on his computer, the hallucinations and pain can make him lose his mind, scream at the top of his lungs, or try to destroy his equipment in a fit of range. If the hallucinations didn't effect his experiments, one could argue that they felt a little tacked on. However, director Darren Aronofsky was able to work them into the conflict he faced in the film, and he avoided having them feel gratuitous.The external conflict he encounters mainly comes into the film near the latter portion of the film. When it happens, it changes the film entirely, and it makes a lot of events make sense which we saw earlier in the film. It's a very interesting way of showing you how his simple task turned into something much, much more. It also makes the ambiguity of the films ending have a great impact on the viewer and it leaves you thinking about it, and what exactly Max did. The film takes a common weird trope for weird films, hallucinations, and it creates conflict in the film out of it.The hallucinations in the film are really well-done. The main reason why they work so good is because we are able to feel Max's pain during them. The sudden and striking sound effects which the viewer hears plays a main role at making the viewer feel these unpleasant emotions with Max. Sounds can sometimes effect our emotions more than visuals. You could always remove the sound and hope for the viewer to connect the dots at what the protagonist is feeling. However, a simple loud sound effect can frighten the viewer even more. This movie does a really good job at using this technique to terrify the viewer who's watching the film.Having a low budget can really take a viewer out of the movie if the director is not thrifty. Poor scenery and effects can be a real withdrawer and it can kill immersion quickly. However, despite having such a minuscule budget, the effects and scenery looked top notch. The computers and the setup of Max's room that Max uses look convincing and realistic, and since there's so many machines around his apartment which look high-tech, it looks like a believable work station for something so complicated that he's doing. Also, the effects looked very good as well. They looked realistic for a low-budget film, and they still hold up today pretty well. It's a great trait for a director to be able to do so much with so little. That's exactly what Aronofsky did here, and by doing so, he proved that he was a talented director.When some people watch a movie, they often like to kick back and relax. This movie doesn't let you. Sometimes, the movie can be hard to watch at times. It's not for everyone. Some people dislike Eraserhead for that reason. However, I love these kinds of films. I love the sprightly feelings that they evoke from the viewer. I feel like I can revisit them again and again, and every time I do so, they still impress me as much, if not, more than my first viewing.",8,1,3,22 June 2016
Mulholland Drive," A haunting Lynch film with a deep meaning
","David Lynch is a filmmaker known for the absurdity of his films. However, he is also really good at inserting highly complex story lines into his movies. Every time I re-watch one of his films, I feel like I understand them a little more. More complex events which didn't make any sense to me or meant nothing to me on my first viewing feel creative once I come up with a good explanation to them. This, in turn, made Lynch a really great filmmaker. It gave his films more staying power.After a car crash renders a woman named Rita amnesiac, she partners up with a woman named Betty hoping to become a Hollywood actress as they search for answers across L.A., encountering several bizarre events in the process.There is a widely accepted broad explanation of the film. However, even after you look it up, the film still has a lot of staying power. There are several other scenes from the film which appear to go deeper, and this gives it more staying power. However, no matter how much you look up, it still always seems like there is more to learn from the film, and it still keeps you coming back. The film is constructed so that it will always be open to interpretation. Every time you first watch the movie, your initial explanation always seems off, and it's hard to feel comfortable with it without watching it more times. This movie finds a great balance between reality and fantasy. It sounds very cryptic at first. However, after you pay attention to a few clues in the film, you start to form a basic idea of what's happening, and you should be able to go off from that and expand your interpretation of the film.Like most Lynch films, this is very complicated. Lynch finds many ways of giving hints to its meaning in many possible ways. He has brilliant cinematography which includes a red and pink color scheme (this is important symbolism). He also has weird set pieces which seem out of place. One of them is when they investigate an apartment where someone named 'Diane Selwyn' supposedly lives. They find a disturbing scene there which gives a frightening clue to what the film means. Also, there is a blue box and a key which seems very odd and out of place. It makes the viewer wonder what its purpose of being in the film is. Lynch made it so that every single event from the film which seemed out of place to the storyline gave somewhat of a hint to what the film meant. I liked how Lynch did this as I thought that it was a clever method. He left subtle hints that were easily noticeable, but they weren't too obvious that they gave the films' meaning away.This film also has many scary scenes. The diner scene is perhaps the most famous one. It was very suspenseful. The viewer knew that something bad might happen. However, they also had a slight feeling of confidence that they would be fine. As tension got higher, the viewer knew that anything could go wrong, and that sense of confidence kept on dwindling. However, it was still hanging on in the back of their minds. The payoff of that scene worked very well since the buildup was really good. Also, the ending scene was very terrifying as well. The lighting and camera-work made it very unnerving, and the viewer was probably horrified. Lynch made no attempts to show suspense or to build up the tension here. He just put the payoff right at the beginning of the scene to show the viewer what they had to be terrified of. The result was a terrifying sight. Also, I found that there were some scenes which seemed scarier on repeat viewings as I got to expand my interpretation of the film. Overall, this film provided a great amount of terror.The soundtrack to this film was really good. It was very ominous. Also, it contributed really well to the sense of mystery that the film had. The intro when it shows Rita's car moving down the highway feels like a haunting way to start off the film. Not only is the soundtrack dark and ominous, but it also can be emotional at times, especially with the 'Love Theme'. Songs from it carry several different emotions. It fits in perfectly with the movie.In conclusion, this movie is amazing. I'm not sure if it's my idea of a masterpiece (although, I feel like my rating for it could rise on future viewings), but it's still very good. It has very good ambiguity and it leaves a few clues big enough to make the viewer enjoy it a lot more on future viewings. It also has many scary scenes which can make it haunting at times, especially after you learn a bit more about its plot. It expertly represents Lynch's talent at making complicated and weird films. When 'Sight & Sound' published their 2012 edition of the top 250 best movies ever made, this film ranked at #28. I still like Eraserhead a little more, but I can understand the praise for this film. It accomplishes a lot, and it may grow on me over time as well (that was what Eraserhead did after all).",9,2,3,26 July 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," A forgettable entry in the Marvel Franchise
","Although somewhat entertained throughout, I wasn't that impressed by this one. The acting was fine. The soundtrack may not be as good as fans make it out to be but it was still pretty catchy. Also the cgi looked pretty good. However, I felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be funny. Even though it's suppose to be this very funny movie, nobody was laughing at the theater I was in. The comedy was very forced and I felt that it wasn't really necessary half the time. At the beginning of the movie. I thought it was going to be a deep movie but after the first 20 minutes, my hope was gone. It ended up being a misguided action movie. The unmemorable super villain was another misstep. And that's another main flaw in the movie. Character development was minimal and I felt no emotional attachment to half of the main characters. I did enjoy most recent Marvel movies but this was just okay. It was a forgettable entry in the marvel series and it didn't do it for me.",3,4,9,3 February 2015
The Imitation Game," This is flawed but it is quite moving and disheartening
","How fast have you been sold on someone's performance? Benedict Cumberbatch sold me in the first 5 minutes. He was truly amazing and he deserves to win Best Actor. He did a performance for all ages.This is a movie based on a true story about a group of mathematician's trying to solve the Enigma code. The rest of the movie retells the incidents of how they solved the code and the events that happened in between.You can argue that this movie is Oscar bait and technically you'd be right. But I found this movie to be very entertaining. It is suspenseful and exhilarating watching them try to crack the code. The mutual trust and friendship between the colleagues is uplifting. Also, the realization in their heroism is gut-wrenching.Also, there are some very depressing and sad moments near the end. It gives more insight to this dark tale by featuring them. I was more engaged into the film when it showed them.The constant cuts between time periods can be kind of heavy-handed but if you're able to get over it then you should like the movie.Also, this movie isn't confusing in terms of math. You don't need to be a mathematician to understand the movie. It is very easy to follow so anyone can pick up on it.I really liked this movie. It is both uplifting and disheartening at the same time. It has flaws but it kept me entertained throughout the whole experience.",5,2,2,14 May 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Contains a poor plot line, no character development, numerous plot holes, overly-sadistic violence, and an underwhelming and unimpressive final fight
","This could've been an amazing revenge movie, but it is ultimately brought down by numerous flaws such as plot holes, no character development, and a ton of overly-sadistic violence.This story is about a woman known as The Bride who was knocked out at her wedding where most of the people who attended it, including her husband and, supposedly, her daughter were killed. After waking up from a 4-year long coma, she seeks revenge on everyone who betrayed her and attempts to murder them all one by one.Quentin Tarantino likes to make his plot lines out of order. Usually, this is a good thing because it leaves a lot of room for re-watching his movies. In fact, that is one of the things which made Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs so good. However, it doesn't work for this movie because some of the scenes in it make no sense at all and they don't seem to fit anywhere in the plot line of the movie. It made me think that I somehow missed an earlier movie. An example of these scenes include the scene when she fights a mother and kills her in front of her daughter.There is also no character development in the movie. This movie's final act requires for you to care about the characters in the film and the connection I was supposed to have just wasn't there for me. I didn't feel this because the characters aren't very developed in the film. Because of this, it was hard for me to care about any of the characters in the film, and I could care less for which ones lived and which ones died. Character development matters in films where the main character is facing death. Take this sentence and tell it to everyone who has ever thought of directing a movie before.Also, there are numerous plot holes. By far, the biggest one is how the police are never called in the film. Examples of scenes in the film where the police should've been called include her killing a doctor and not even attempting to hide his body, killing a mother in front of her own child, and the massacre at the Japanese restaurant at the end. Since the film is grounded in present day, the police should have been called more often. Another plot hole in the film is how O-Ren Ishii got to the head of the Japanese Mafia despite having awful bodyguards and adequate fighting skills at best.Quentin Tarantino likes putting sadistic violence into his movies. However, he takes it way too far here. People are decapitated, eyeballs are ripped out, young girls see their mothers murdered, and people have their limbs cut off. Some people said that the violence is presented in an over-the-top way, but I didn't see that at all. In this movie, the violence is presented in a more serious way with people screaming in agony and people wriggling around on the ground like a worm after their body parts are chopped off. This isn't fun violence. The violence here is appalling, deeply unpleasant, and viscerally disturbing. The sadism in this movie lacks any context and the movie is just being sadistic for the sake of sadism. Sadism also extends to other areas in the movie besides bloody violence such as how a doctor raped The Bride when she was in a coma, how the same doctor allowed other patients to rape her as well, and a guy getting his head slammed in a door for information until he dies. It's utterly grotesque and it makes you feel sickened after watching it.Also, the fight scene at the end between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii felt very underwhelming, unimpressive, and slow-moving. I felt more suspense in the Crazy 88 fight and previous fights than that one. The problem with it is that it had long instances of them pausing and staring at each other and a couple very short scenes of them fighting each other. Because of this, it felt unnecessarily slow-moving. Also, the few instances of them fighting were unimpressive to say the least. Since that's the final fight, you'll expect that she'll have the most trouble killing her. However, I'll argue that the elite Crazy 88 and Gogo Yubari were more difficult for her to fight since they did more damage to her.I will admit that there are some good parts to this film. Mainly that of the production design and cinematography. Sets are beautifully shot and gorgeous to look at. The film also has pretty great acting which is much better than what the film deserves. Also, the final few minutes are a pretty good ending and setup for the next film and the fight between The Bride and Gogo Yubari is actually pretty good.However, these few and minor positive points don't overshadow the numerous flaws in the movie because it has a poor plot line, lack of character development, plot holes, sadistic violence, and a disappointing final fight. Unfortunately, because of this, I can't really recommend Kill Bill to anyone except die hard Tarantino fans and action movie and violence fanatics. Tarantino is a great filmmaker who has made many great movies in his career, but he unfortunately wasted his time and money on a self-indulgent vanity project like this one.",3,3,5,13 December 2015
Jurassic World," This is better than the 2nd and 3rd movies but it still has problems.
","The good news is that Jurassic World is a massive improvement from the 2nd and 3rd installments. Unfortunately, it's not perfect and it has a few problems.After scientists create a new dinosaur, it's shown to be intelligent and it escapes. Then the workers need to stop it before it kills the people on the island.What's good about this movie is that it seems slow at first but then surprises us and causes the action to pick up drastically. The action scenes look good and several scenes keep us on the edge of our seats the entire time. It doesn't have the same amount of tense moments that the original film had but it still delivers a fair amount of thrills.The effects are probably the best in the series so far. They are well done and they look realistic. There are a couple of scenes which look obviously cgi but not enough to distract the viewer from all the thrills.The film has mostly new characters. Chris Pratt's character showed promise but he gets overshadowed instantly when the carnage begins to happen. The film is mostly light on character development. I was at first going to ignore this but then I realized - what do we know about Pratt's character besides the fact that he works with the dinosaurs? Most if not all of the characters were so underdeveloped though that I could care less which ones lived and which ones died.There is a much higher body count then all the other films. But it lacks the showmanship and tension that Jurassic Park had. Also, while its script is slightly predictable, it does not overstay its welcome. The finale started off okay. It had its fair share of thrills but it was very predictable. It could've been seen coming from a mile away.This is a huge improvement over Jurassic Park 2 and 3. It's not perfect but it's showing promise that this once beloved series might come back.",4,3,10,15 June 2015
Black Hawk Down," In my opinion, this is one of the best war films ever made
","Many people may disagree with this but in my opinion, this is one of the best war films ever made. Sure, it's not a masterpiece but in my opinion, it's very close to being one. This movie is a highly well-done experience.123 U.S. soldiers are dropped into Somalia to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and they find themselves in a desperate battle with a large number of heavily-armed Somalis.Ridley Scott has created one of the most realistic war movies ever. I actually felt that I was in the middle of the war-zone as it was going on. Because of how much it felt like the actual story, the movie creates a high amount of tension and it makes the viewer realize what exactly went on when the real event happened. The movie does an especially superb job on this because of the realistic environments, shots, and acting.The score is fantastic. When certain scenes happen, it draws emotions out of us. Unlike a lot of movies, Black Hawk Down's score works with the movie. This means that without the music when a certain character dies off or when another important scene happens, it will have an impact on you regardless. But the score makes that feeling you had more massive.Many people dislike the fact that this movie didn't have much character development. It is true that it's light on it but this film isn't focused on developing the characters, nor does it have to. It's completely dedicated to providing us with a first-person perspective of being in the middle of combat.This movie does have a lot of suspense but it can be a bit mundane getting to the good parts. The opening is quite overlong and dry. It is full of military jargon and diagrams. But despite this, this movie is definitely worth seeing. After the opening is over, you're in for a big treat.So in conclusion, this is a truly outstanding movie. Even though the opening is slow, this movie will impress you because of how realistic it is. It has realistic environments, shots, and acting. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest war films ever made.",8,2,3,13 August 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," An entertaining sequel which doesn't quite live up to the original
","Avengers: Age Of Ultron is an exciting sequel to the 2012 movie even though it doesn't quite live up to the original.The plot is that Tony Stark and Bruce Banner accidentally create an AI called Ultron. He says that he wants to save the world but his idea of saving means destroying the world so the team has to get together and stop him.Firstly, this is not a bad movie. I liked it a lot. Each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are magnificent. The final battle is epic and entertaining. The movie is computer animated but it didn't bother me at all. Also, a particular character's death scene near the end is unexpected and sad.But I had a huge issue with the movie's comedy. Marvel sometimes puts one-liners and comedy relief in. Sometimes it works but other times it doesn't. The movie has a lot of one-liners and I found most of them not to be funny. Also, some of them felt really out of place. They would be in battle fighting for their lives and some of them would just be making jokes desensitizing the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience. It feels really out of place.Also, I had an issue with the script. I don't want to say too much because I want to keep this review spoiler free. But I will say that it feels very rushed and unorganized. There are a few completely unnecessary side plots. There are also some useless characters that could've been removed because they really don't impact the story overall. Also, the villain was a massive letdown in Marvel's growing pile of mishandled super villains.In conclusion, this movie has positives. If you like cgi action scenes then you'll enjoy this because the movie handles the special effects nicely. But if you were looking for a deep story which the trailer promised then you'll be massively disappointed.",4,6,13,16 May 2015
Everest," A gripping movie which has intelligent action, great visuals, and depth to the characters
","This is my most anticipated movie for 2015. I really enjoy survival-thriller movies and this one interested me greatly. When I got to see it, I was not disappointed at all and my anticipation more than paid off.This movie details the true story of the mountaineering disaster of 1996. After a snow storm hits Mount Everest, it strands a group of people on top of the mountain and the people down at the base camps have to rescue them before it's too late.I could see this movie claiming Oscar gold in 2016. It is an amazing visual experience. The cinematography, lighting, and sound all combine to make this one realistic movie. You actually feel like you're on Mount Everest and you can not get much closer to the mountain unless you actually visit it in real life. Some scenes work very well. Certain scenes show them walking over thin strips of land and we see a very deep void at the bottom. There are many of these scenes and they work so well because of the great sound design and camera angles. Don't miss out on seeing this in Imax.Also, this movie is not just style over substance. It has depth to many of its characters also. Most of the depth goes to Rob Hall (played by Jason Clarke). The depth surrounding him mainly revolves around how his wife and kids react to him being stuck out there. Also, some of the other people have depth to them as well. Some of them obviously have more depth than others but keep in mind that there are a whole lot of actors and actresses in this movie and there is only so much depth you can put in a movie. I think that this movie put just enough depth to the characters.Also, the acting is phenomenal on all parts. I can see Jason Clarke getting an Oscar nomination in 2016. I'm not sure if he'll win an Oscar for 'Best Actor' because I don't know what 2016 will have to offer in terms of acting but I can definitely say that he has a pretty good chance of at least getting a nomination. However, there are many other Oscars which I feel that this movie has the potential of winning and I hope that it ages well Many people disliked the 3D in this movie. Also, many people tend to dislike it when many other movies use 3D. Unlike many others though, I don't really think that a movie being in 3D is a bad thing. I know that it technically is a gimmick to make extra money at the box office but I wouldn't say that having 3D lessens a movie's quality at all. I thought that the 3D in this movie was very good and I felt that it enhanced the movie's visuals. I can understand why some people don't like 3D but I don't really mind it.In conclusion, this movie is a great example of how to write survival films. Hopefully, this influences other films of the same genre in the future. It contains just what I feel is mandatory in survival-thrillers: intelligent action, great visuals, and depth to the characters. I said this earlier in this review but I will say it again - do not miss out seeing this film in Imax. It is an amazing experience.",7,4,9,18 September 2015
Into the Wild," A terrific and poignant character study
","This is a well-written tale which is a poignant and moving character study. It may not appeal to all fans of the survival genre but it is still an amazing movie which is an emotional ride.Graduated student Christopher McCandless donates all of his money to charity and begins to set out to live in the Alaskan wild. Along the way, he meets a series of people who change his life.Its story is very deep. It's a story of following a path that you choose for yourself. I always like it when movie's have deep plots which make you think. Christopher says that he feels career's are a 20th-century invention and he wants no part of that and I sort of agree with him. Its story is really important because it revolves around and talks about the opinion that many people have.The acting is great from Emile Hirsch. Many of the other actors give superb roles as well. There weren't any actors who gave performances I had an issue with.I don't think it's flawless though. There were very few scenes of survival in this film. I likely would've enjoyed the movie more had it consisted of something like 50% survival scenes and 50% flashbacks. However, what we got instead was about 85%-90% flashbacks. Also, the film dragged a little.Also, on a side note, I recommend you don't read the critic reviews because many of them contain spoilers. I usually trust the critics, but in this case, I'd say ignore them and read them after you watch the movie.So in conclusion, this is a great character study which contains great lessons and it may affect you greatly depending on what you believe. It could've been better, but it's still a good film.",7,0,2,22 August 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," My 2nd favorite film of all time
","For over a year, '2001: A Space Odyssey' has been my favorite movie ever made. It is one of the films which got me into reviewing films, and it still holds up just as much as it did on my first viewing. There are many people who say that it is one of the best movies ever made. I'd probably put it somewhere in the top 10. It has accomplished so much, and it's pretty hard for me to think of other films which could top it.This movie has a few story lines. The 'Dawn of Man' sequence shows man-apes developing the first tool, and taking a big step forward in evolution. The next storyline shows a group of astronauts on an expedition to the moon. The third storyline shows astronauts investigating an object on Jupiter with the help of an intelligent computer named HAL. The final part of the film shows the famous Stargate sequence, and this is when the film gets really complicated.I really love ambiguity. Some of my favorite films have ambiguity. However, I feel like this film does the best job at ambiguity. What sets it apart from all the other films? The reason I say it's the best is because I feel like it has the most interpretations to it. Kubrick didn't leave any clues whatsoever in the film, and by doing so, he opened up the film to many answers. I feel like no matter how many times I watch it, there will still be more interpretations that could come out of it. I have not seen any film before which gave me the same feeling towards its ambiguous moments. Usually when films gets complicated, the transitions will impress me. However, 2001 impressed me a lot more by its visuals. The visuals of the Stargate sequence were hypnotic and impressive. It was made entirely through practical effects. It may seem easy to create it nowadays, but this film was from the 1960's. That was when computers still used magnetic tape storage. If that scene doesn't impress you, nothing will.Speaking of the visuals, they looked brilliant. In fact, more than brilliant. I already mentioned how the Stargate sequence looked really good. However, that's only the tip of the iceberg. There is hardly a single frame in this film which doesn't seem intricately designed, flawlessly composed, and superbly lit. It also has impressive framing and symmetrical compositions which makes many of its shots stick out even more. Even if the viewer gets confused by it at first, the amazing visuals will keep you coming back until you do. In my opinion, '2001: A Space Odyssey' has the best cinematography in history. No film has ever topped it before, and this films' visuals feel untouchable. The only film which has come close to topping this one before is Terrence Malick's 'Tree of Life'. However, not even that film can top this. I have a feeling that it's going to remain at #1 for a long time.HAL was a really good villain. When you watch the movie, you have a little confidence that HAL won't be able to overpower the crew of the ship. However, when you're able to figure out what HAL's plan is, it's already too late. The lines he uses in the film are really good. Even when his life is in danger, he tries to use a normal voice to calm the astronaut down. Some portions of the film with him can be really unnerving for that reason. However, I think that the biggest reason why he works so good is that it's debatable whether he is actually evil or not. It's possible that his actions are all a part of self-defense. Because of this, the viewer would likely be unsure whether they're supposed to sympathize or despise his character. In my opinion, these kinds of villains (The Revenant for example) are the best kinds of villains. Also, let's not forget the hidden secret where if you replace every letter in 'HAL' with the letter after it, you get IBM, an American multinational technology and consulting corporation.This films' soundtrack is brilliant. It is very iconic and it's easily recognizable today. 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' is not only iconic, but it feels very grand. Every time it's played in the film, important breakthroughs in evolution are occurring. The song perfectly lets you know that something spectacular is occurring. When you go back to try and interpret the film, the soundtrack is a good clue to figuring it out. Its also fun to listen to on your own. It never gets bland, and it always feels just as amazing as when you originally heard it in the movie. There are other songs which feel haunting. Those songs perfectly represent all of the weird parts in the film. They also work very good in the background, because they immerse you with many parts of the film. The iconic 'Stargate sequence' is made even better by its ominous score. The soundtrack perfectly represents the movie.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, and it's one of the greatest films ever. It accomplishes a lot such as handling ambiguity better than any other movie I've ever seen has, containing the best visuals out of every movie I've seen, containing one of the best villains ever, and containing one of the best soundtracks ever. Every time when I re-watch it, I feel like I pick up on a lot of new things, and it still feels fresh and original. The reason why it's my favorite film of all time is because I'd rather watch it than all other movies I've seen. A few of my favorites came close to topping it before, but none were successful, and it still sits at #1. This is Kubrick's magnum opus.",10,3,6,27 July 2016
Selma," This is an entertaining drama but it's not for everyone
","Selma is a pretty entertaining drama about Martin Luther King, Jr. I think that David Oyelowo did a great job acting. He had a strong role and did a great job bringing the elements of courage and bravery to the screen with his powerful performance. It also had pretty good emotional power in it. This is not for everyone with its talk heavy dialogue but for those who like slower films then this is for them. It doesn't have the same power as '12 Years a Slave' does though. Still, it's good for a few viewings and it is pretty moving at some parts. I was pretty entertained by this. A couple of the boring or slower scenes lost me but there weren't too many of them and most of them were only in the first hour. It did a good job capturing the ugliness of the 1960's with the marches and some other sequences of violence. If you want to see a history lesson on screen then you'll likely enjoy the film.",7,6,9,17 February 2015
Saw," One of the best horror movies of the 2000's
","The sequels weren't that good but in my opinion, this is one of the better horror movies of the 2000's. As the film continues on, it gets more tense and the different traps make more tension. As soon as it starts, Adam and Dr. Lawrence start recalling incidents so they can figure out what happened to them and who put them there. It's a great look into human survival and it covers the depths of insanity as they start to turn on each other. I know it's excessively gory at some parts so this is not for everyone but most horror fans would probably like it. Also, at the final 5 minutes, its twist ending will knock you cold. Accompanied, by the epic score, your heart will be racing beyond belief. I'm not going to spoil the ending because it must be witnessed start to finish to be fully appreciated. But, thinking about the true nature of it, makes it more terrifying. Unfortunately, all the other sequels weren't able to recapture the charm of the first one but if you want an epic, gore-filled, tense story about survival then you'll likely enjoy this one as long as you can get past the gore.",7,0,1,18 February 2015
A Clockwork Orange," A smart film which explores the nature of free will and the relationship between man and the government
","Kubrick is my favorite director of all time. He has produced so many masterpieces, and so many of his films are seen as magnum opuses of their respective genres. It's also hard to pick his best film as I like most of his films more as I continue to re-watch them. I put off watching 'A Clockwork Orange' for quite a long time. I knew about the violent/sexually explicit content in it. I wanted to make sure that I was desensitized before watching it. I didn't want to miss out on something spectacular due to it being too much for me to handle. When I did watch it, however, it only took 5 minutes for me to get engaged into the film.In future Britain, a violent gang leader named Alex DeLarge is betrayed by his gang, captured by the police, and put in prison. While there, he volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy created by the government in hopes of becoming non-violent so he can be released back into society.Alex's parents seem to be completely clueless to the dystopian state of the world. Strangely, Alex has a fond love of classical music, especially Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Classical music is often played over scenes of violence, sex, and rape. In the opening scene at the milk bar, sexual imagery is present throughout it. This imagery is also found in many more scenes in the film. Those scenes display how most men are led around by their sexual desires, and contribute nothing to society. Liberal activists and therapists try to make Alex a productive member of society, and they try to get him to be non-violent. However, what's important to the film is that he doesn't change by the end.Character arcs are meant to show how a particular character changes over the events of the movie. However, character arcs can also work even if the character winds up back at the beginning. The reason Alex DeLarge's character arc works so well is partly because of the fact that the viewer doesn't expect that it will happen. His resolution comes as a complete surprise. Another reason why it works is because it approaches character arcs in a different way. Its uniqueness helps it stand out from other films with memorable character arcs. It gives the viewer another reason to enjoy the film.In the first third of the film, the viewer quickly grows to hate Alex. He seems to have no redeeming qualities to him. He beats and rapes numerous people throughout the film. However, in the final third, we feel sorry for Alex as he continuously gets beaten by people he hurt in the first third. The reason the viewer feels sympathy for him is because he has no free will. The government has effected him in a way which made him unable to defend himself. Despite everything we saw him do, we feel sorry for him since he is turned into a test monkey. The treatment quickly feels like torture. When the government tries to get him to mend their reputation to the public, it comes off like he's getting forced into doing it. The final scene has a somewhat positive effect on the viewer, as they know that the side effects the government caused Alex to experience will no longer effect him. This serves as the light at the end of the tunnel.The visuals in the film are also pretty good. Kubrick makes full use of the wide angle lens. This is used on objects which are relatively close to the camera. Objects on the edges of shots tend to curve upwards. This allows us to view the world in a bizarre way, sort of like how Alex views it. These shots also allow us to get a clear view of the environment that the movie takes place in (this is sort of like the purpose of the long takes in 'Children of Men'). Also, it's hard to forget the first shot of the film. The angle of the first shot makes Alex look menacing. The camera angle is positioned slightly above his head. This makes him look up at the viewer.However, this only applies for camera techniques. The movie also has stunning cinematography. The settings look particularly intriguing. The phallic imagery gives the world a haunting feeling. The apartment block that Alex lives in looks rundown and poorly managed. It lets the viewer know that the environment has deteriorated overtime. There are a lot of scenes which look intricately designed. Although '2001: A Space Odyssey' is still Kubrick's most visually impressive film, this one doesn't fall too far behind it, and it remains as a strong contender for that position.In conclusion, this movie is another one of Kubrick's many masterpieces. Behind all of the explicit scenes in it, it is a smart film. It explores the nature of free will and the relationship between man and the government. The character arc that Alex goes through is unique and enthralling. The movie also makes us become attached to Alex's character. On top of that, the film has outstanding visuals and camera-work. Finally, who can forget the iconic and haunting score which plays at the beginning? It sounds ominous, and it adds to the bizarre tone of the film. This is not an easy movie to watch as many people will find it hard to sit through. However, it's a must-see film. It just requires you to be desensitized to movie violence quite a bit.",10,1,2,11 November 2016
The Fly," A gruesome movie with greatly developed characters
","This tragic and disturbing body horror film has strongly developed characters which make it a surprisingly affective horror film.After a scientist attempts to teleport himself, a fly accidentally gets in with him and he begins to gruesomely transform into a man/fly hybrid.This movie is all about tension. It leads up to the big reveal of the monster at the end. Also, it has greatly developed characters. The movie does a great job making us sympathize with Brundle and at the end, it contains a tragic ending which works so well because we can't help but feel sorry for Brundle after seeing what he's been through. It's pretty hard to watch but it's fitting.The special effects look phenomenal and despite being almost 30 years old, they still look gruesome today. Few movie monsters are as disturbing to look at as this one. I once thought that The Thing (1982) had great effects for its time (which it does) but this movie clearly has put as much effort into making the effects as gruesome and realistic as possible.But I didn't like how the movie started off slow. It took half an hour for Brundle to first get infected. I get that the movie was trying to set up the characters (and it succeeded in doing so) but the first half hour felt much slower then the rest of the film. It should have been cut down a bit. However, the other hour of the film which follows is well-done and it had great buildup and tension.Despite a slow start, The Fly is a very well-done movie which has strongly developed characters. Its effects are disgusting and realistic and they still hold up today. Its ending is very tragic and it gets me every time. If you don't mind gore then I strongly recommend this film.",9,0,1,4 August 2015
Groundhog Day," A fantastic character study
","I was interested in seeing this film because I was curious what they were going to do with its plot. There is a lot you can do with a plot like this and I was interested to know which directions the movie was going to go in. I was very proud of the angle the movie went in. After watching it, I can safely say that it is one of the best comedies from the past 25-30 years.A weatherman finds himself living the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. He is the only one who seems to know that it is happening. After he adjusts to it, he tries different things such as finding a love interest, meeting new people, doing illegal activities, helping out people, and trying to figure out how to stop it from going on.Instances he encounters on that day which keeps on getting repeated include: meeting a friendly former classmate who is trying to sell him insurance, doing a news report on the event of the 'Groundhog Day' which he finds to be stupid and pointless, and experiencing a snow blizzard which traps him in a town. He is also very rude to his co-workers: Rita and Larry. He dislikes his job, his colleagues, and himself most of all.However, he learns that in order for the event to stop: he may have to change his normal way of life. Over the course of the days, he discovers his love for Rita and his desire to be with her. He also learns to be more kind to other people and he gets to know and help out people around town that he wouldn't have been introduced to had the events in the film had never have taken place. The event makes him learn to love himself and others. It's a very interesting idea a film could use for representing a change in a characters personality.Another great thing in the film is that it leaves the reason for the day's constant repetition ambiguous. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide why that happened to him. It makes the viewer wonder if there was an entity or something else that was doing this to him in hopes of having him change his life and personality around. I can understand why someone wouldn't like this, but I didn't mind it because it gave the film sort of an alien or other-worldly feel to it. That's not to say that the movie didn't have one to begin with, but the ambiguity increased it.Phil's character development in the movie is very convincing and realistic because we can easily believe that the situation would make him react the way he does. There are dark periods in the film when he endangers his life, does illegal activities, and tries to commit suicide. There are also reckless periods in the film when he tries weird and foolish things he wouldn't normally try. Finally, there are some happy periods in the film when he tries to improve on his life and personality. It makes sense that he would try different things because since he doesn't know anything about the situation: There is no way for him to know how to stop it from happening and whether or not he's supposed to do something. Since he loves Rita, the only way he can impress her is by actually changing instead of faking it. At one point in the movie, Rita says that egocentricity is one of his 'defining characteristics'. He doesn't stop being egocentric at the end. He just learns to use it in a positive direction.One of the other great things about this film is Bill Murray's terrific acting. I can't think of any actor who would've performed the role better than Bill Murray did. He proved to us that he's not only able to show dramatic depth, but he is also able to combine a comedic and serious side all into the same character. I think that his role here is his best performance yet.The only thing I didn't like about it is that I wished it was funnier. Of course, there were only a couple points in the film when it made me laugh. However, even the jokes that I did laugh at weren't super creative or that well-written. However, this is my only complaint for the film and nothing else really bugged me about it.In conclusion, this could've just been a good movie, but the fantastic choice of turning it into a character study makes it something special. His character development was interesting and convincing and it was handled very well in the movie. The feeling of ambiguity and Bill Murray's incredible acting also helped to carry this movie. Even though it was light on comedy, this is still an amazing comedy film which ranks up there with some of the very best of the genre.",7,1,2,7 February 2016
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino proved to be a talented director with his debut film
","Quentin Tarantino is definitely one of the most famous directors out there. While he is most famous for 'Pulp Fiction' which is commonly called one of the greatest movies ever made, many of his other films usually get high praise too. What I really like about Tarantino is that while most of his movies are style over substance, it usually never bothers me because his movies often contain a certain aspect to them that is handled so masterfully, I don't mind nor care about the lack of character development or depth. This is his debut film which started his movie making career and this is where all of his talent originated from.After a jewelry heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant and tension rises between them as they slowly start to become more and more suspicious of each other.I mentioned that the majority of his movies being style over substance doesn't bother me because he often handles a particular aspect so well that I don't mind nor care about the lack of depth. What makes this film work so well is its non-linear plot. If it was linear then it wouldn't be as interesting. Its timeline being out of order, however, actually works in its favor. In fact, we actually never see the jewelry heist take place. This movies shows us the aftermath of it. The criminals describe what went wrong in the heist often in the film and they describe it by using such descriptive detail that we are able to imagine what went on in the heist in our heads.Despite all the praise this movie has gotten, some people accused Tarantino of being a plagiarist. There are definitely some similarities to movies such as 'The Killing', 'The Asphalt Jungle', 'The Taking of Pelham 123', and 'City on Fire'. Tarantino was definitely influenced by those movies but the word 'stealing' is a pretty heavy and strong accusation. Reservoir Dogs is great by itself and it still contains a lot of originality. Tarantino clearly has an extensive film knowledge and he likes to pay an homage to some of his favorite directors very often. In Tarantino's case, his technique helped him make 2 of the best films of the 90's: 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'.The ensemble cast works very well together and it helps shapes the movie. Usually when I watch movies, I find that only a select few of the actors stand out among the rest. However, I felt that all of the actors stood out a lot. Many of the actors talk fast and, by doing so, it really makes the words jump out of the screen. Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) is the one that steals the show though. He has been through a lot and we can't help but feel sorry for his character and he is the one that most people root for. Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) plays the mob boss. He does a great job in his role and he is able to convince the audience that he's a character that you don't mess with. I wish that he was in the movie more. If he was in more scenes, he would have been a much more memorable character but he still is pretty memorable in the parts he does appear in.Without any doubt, this film is definitely a masterpiece. It may not be on the same level as 'Pulp Fiction' is in terms of greatness and impact on cinema history but its quality is surprisingly not far from it. I really enjoyed its non-linear plot structure and I hope that Tarantino expands on this in future films because he creates outstanding works of cinema when he does that. Every time he does it, I always find myself in awe in certain scenes, especially the endings which are very well-executed and often catch me off guard and surprise me. Back in 1992, Tarantino showed us what he was truly capable of and he proved to the world that he was, in fact, a very talented film maker.",8,0,0,9 October 2015
Pulp Fiction," Deserves all the praise it has gotten over the years
","Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.This movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.What this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.Also, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.Also, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.This movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.So in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies.",9,4,8,2 December 2015
Die Hard," One of the greatest action films ever made
","Die Hard has had many sequels but none have ever had the sheer amount of thrills this one had. This movie is about a group of employees at a Christmas party who get taken hostage by terrorists and one cop in the building has to save them. It's funny, thrilling, it has great performances, and it has great actors. This movie makes every fight scene look very tense and it has creative kills for the terrorists. It also surprises us with its well-constructed script and its perfect pacing which remains consistent and easy to follow throughout the whole film. The movie is not perfect though because of the marriage conflict with McClane and his wife. It's great for an action movie to have a character development but I found it to be uninteresting. But this is a minor complaint on my part. Overall, this movie is fantastic. It's super entertaining and it has influenced many later action films. Many have tried to top this but none have ever succeeded. This movie is probably one of if not the best action movie of all time and it's a must watch for all fans of the action genre.",8,1,1,8 May 2015
Rosemary's Baby," A claustrophobic and well-paced horror film which will get under your skin
","Once Rosemary's Baby takes off, it becomes a brilliant psychological and claustrophobic horror film.After a woman gets pregnant, she becomes increasingly suspicious as a result of bizarre coincidences and occurrences. She then starts to expect the worst and slowly starts to dip into insanity.The film's construction is amazing. Things start off slow and then slowly build up. Things gradually pick up speed to make us more nervous. The events start off a bit slow at first but once the movie picks up, it keeps us on the edge of our seats and we're left on our seats dying to find out what happens next.This is definitely one of the more atmospheric, subtle, and creepy horror films out there. It's really rare that you find a film like this anymore. Most horror films are 'in your face' nowadays but this one sneaks up on you and messes with your head throughout it.The score is amazing. The soft motherly voice and the shill instruments get under our skin and it sets up what kind of movie this is. Mia Farrow gave an outstanding performance. She did a great job setting scenes with her facial expressions. The other supporting actors and actresses were great but Mia did the best job.To be honest though, I saw the ending coming from a mile away. I'm not going to say what it is but it was very predictable. I would've been surprised if my prediction about what I think would happen wasn't correct. During the film, I thought 'I don't think they're going to do this. It would be way too predictable'.The ending needed work. It wasn't completely terrible but it wasn't all that surprising like I hoped it to be. Despite that, the movie is still a phenomenal work of horror. It's claustrophobic and it has a great pacing. It's guaranteed to get under your skin.",8,3,4,15 June 2015
There Will Be Blood," Very intriguing
","The 'rise and fall' archetype is often complimentary for gangster films. I wouldn't call 'There Will Be Blood' a gangster movie. However, it was interesting how they implemented that archetype into this film. They did so with great results.The rise of a miner named Daniel Plainview turned wealthy oilman is explored in this film from the years 1898 - 1927. The film shows how he becomes wealthy, and how he takes advantage of those around him in order to achieve his goals at all costs.This movie is very depressing in many ways. After H.W.'s father dies in an accident when he's an infant, Daniel adopts him, and he pretends that he's his son. He uses him just so he can help him deceive the Sunday family more. Also, it's really hard to watch the scene where he becomes deaf in an accident. However, despite everything he experienced in the film, his character represents hope. He shows that even though Daniel used him as a ploy for better business and wealth, he is still able to break free of the chains he's held down with. Since he and Daniel Plainview are more educated than the Sunday family, he is easily able to see through all of it and know that what Daniel is doing is wrong.After you think about the film a little bit, you start to realize how Daniel used every character he met in the film. After he becomes fed-up with H.W., he spares no time in finding an excuse to get rid of him by sending him to a school for deaf kids. He just works with his long-lost brother to keep deceiving his workers with the family image. If his brother leaves the film, he - only then - brings his son back. Daniel Plainview is a really memorable character, because he is able to expertly deceive those around him without them being able to notice nor do anything about it. At some points in the film, the viewer starts to be tricked into liking Daniel Plainview and it's very easy to forget about his true colors as a result.The cinematography in this movie is excellent. The shots of the desert are gorgeous to look at, and the shots of the ranch feel atmospheric. Every shot makes you feel like you're actually in the time period this movie takes place in. One of the shots that the movie does very well is how it shows you how insignificant the characters are. It shows you a shot of a character. Then, the camera would move up to make it seem like they're in the middle of nowhere. This technique is best utilized in the beginning. After Daniel falls into a mine and breaks his leg, he has to climb out and crawl back to his fellow miners. A shot is pointed at him crawling on his back. Then, the camera moves up and shows us how much he has to trek back. This is a powerful shot, and it's good that they made this technique clear by utilizing it very well in the beginning. That way, the viewer would continue to be immersed every time they did this in the film.The acting was really good. Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview stole the show. He deserved that Oscar he won. Every single line he spoke was convincing. Near the beginning of the film, his voice continuously evoked a slight feeling of distrust. As he got more suspicious and as he made more enemies, his facial expressions gave the viewer a feeling that something bad was about to happen. The highlight of his performance was at the end of the film though. He gives reactions so convincing that they might as well by passed off as genuine. When he slowly goes insane, the viewer feels like the same is happening to them. I honestly can't decide who I liked more: Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men or Daniel Day-Lewis in this film. Both of them were about equally amazing. I liked most of the cast. They were pretty good. However, if I'd have to criticize one actor, it would have to be Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. His performance was good for the most part. However, I felt like he lost some of his believability during the scenes of him preaching at his church. He seemed a bit over-the-top in those scenes. Also, there were a few other parts in the film where when he was yelling, his voice got a bit high-pitched and that didn't fare too well with me. Overall, however, he gave a good performance. He just didn't balance out the impact that Daniel Day-Lewis left.The soundtrack works very well in the movie. There are some songs which sound very haunting, and they do a very good job at representing the feelings of deception that the movie provides. An example of a really effective soundtrack comes in during the gas blowout scene. The striking minimalist soundtrack sets a feeling of urgency, and it makes the scene suspenseful as a result. While the soundtrack worked very well in the film, I found it a bit uninteresting and bland to listen to on my own. It was a soundtrack which was meant to be listened to in the movie. It was still pretty good, but I'm not going to be signing off on its praises anytime soon.In conclusion, this was an amazing movie which was almost perfect. Daniel Plainview and the tension he had with other characters in the film was great and the cinematography was very well-done. For the most part, the acting was good and the soundtrack was still good despite its flaws. This movie is often compared to 'No Country for Old Men' as the 2 were filmed in the same desert. I think that this was an amazing film. However, I liked 'No Country for Old Men' a little more.",8,1,3,26 July 2016
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A masterpiece both uplifting and disheartening
","This is a very interesting and creative movie with emotion and power. It's about a man named Randle McMurphy who goes to a mental institution. Then it shows his many battles with Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched is an obstructionist and nasty character who everyone in the institution hates. Her attitude annoys people greatly even though she barely shows any emotion. Louise Fletcher did a great performance but Jack Nicholson is the one who steals the show. In my opinion, his acting was perfect. He was perfect in timing and character perception. The cinematography was excellent and the haunting score is also equally amazing. The ending takes a dramatic turn making it highly tragic but it shows a great deal of power and emotion and that is what makes it so great as a film. 4 decades later, it still holds up great and it's just as entertaining and moving as it was back in 1975. This is one of the 3 movies in history to receive all 5 top Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay). This is also the most deserving film to receive those awards.",10,2,3,17 April 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Much better then I expected
","This is a great movie which is well-acted, funny, and creative. Its plot revolves around a man put into combat without any training. He's killed within minutes but an alien gives him the opportunity to relive the day over and over in a time loop. He then has to figure out how to stop the alien invasion. Every time he's killed, he learns a bit more and advances a little more. The film offers likable characters. Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise do a great job acting. The film offers some comedic moments to give you a break from the action sequences. This film offers enough surprises and plot twists to keep you entertained. The reason this only gets a 4 out of 5 is because the ending is predictable. The movie tries to play it safe putting in a happy ending but it falls flat because of its choice. Despite this flaw, the film offers enough to keep sci-fi and action fans entertained. Just don't expect it to be revolutionary or decade-defining when watching it and then you should enjoy it. This movie represents what Michael Bay should have been.",7,1,3,26 February 2015
Whiplash," The best film of 2014
","This is one of the most inspiring, moving, and tension filled movies I've ever seen.It's about a boy whose training in college to be a drummer. His instructor Terrence Fletcher is really hard on him and his constant insults drive him to borderline insanity.Seeing Terrence Fletcher yell at Andrew Neyman and watching him get increasingly more upset calls for a very entertaining plot point. I think that it's so important to the film and shapes it a lot. I make the argument that Terrence Fletcher and Andrew Neyman's on screen battles did for us what Randle McMurphy and Nurse Ratched did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.At first people dislike Fletcher but near the end, we get to find out why he teaches the way he does and it makes a lot of sense. The scene when we find out his motivations is really moving and it makes some great character development.The ending is fantastic. It is very tense and shocking. It contains one of the best drum performances I've ever seen put to screen. It is breathtaking from start to finish. It does an excellent job concluding everything we've seen and experienced in the movie and it does a perfect job wrapping it all together.This movie is a masterpiece. It is also one of the best movies I've seen. It contains original and thought provoking themes and it displays them in an excellent way. Everything about this movie is perfect.",8,2,4,11 August 2015
The Green Mile," An emotionally powerful experience
","While The Shawshank Redemption is widely called the best jail/prison movie ever made, The Green Mile is often compared to it and the 2 films can easily be seen as rivals. What's interesting is that both films were directed by the same person, Frank Darabont. However, there is something major which sets both of them apart. The Shawshank Redemption was mainly from the prisoners perspective. The Green Mile, on the other hand, is mainly focused on the prison guards perspective. I was very interested in seeing this movie because I was curious of what he was going to do with it. I was not disappointed when I saw it and I'm glad that I did.After an African American man is sent on death row after supposedly killing 2 young girls, the prisoners and prison guards are shocked when they realize that he has a miraculous gift. They soon start to think that he probably didn't commit the crime and he may be killed for something he didn't do.The best thing about The Green Mile is that it is an emotionally absorbing experience with well-developed characters that I cared for deeply. The movie lets us know that just because the prisoners did something bad once in their lives, they still have a charming and kinder side to them and they might not be as bad as most would expect a death row inmate to be. The movie uses this to make you care for the characters. And you know what, it does a great job at it. Scenes when they die are very sad because of the kinder side the gives to them. I have to give this movie credit for making me grow a connection to death row inmates.There are also characters that you really hate and want to see killed instead of ones you like. There is Wild Bill, a crazy and immature prisoner who acts rude to everyone. The movie did a great job making me hate his character. However, the character that I hated the most was Percy Wetmore. He treats all of the prisoners poorly and shows no respect to any of them. He is even hated by all of the prison guards. There were a few sadistic things he did which I felt were slightly exaggerated and over-the-top, but that's not to say that those actions didn't cause me to develop any sort of vendetta or hatred towards him. All in all, the movie does a great job with most of the main characters. There were some characters which I had a strong emotional attachment to, and there were other ones which I had a bitter hatred for.Another thing I really loved about the movie was its fantasy aspect. It made the movie very interesting and it made the ending kind of thought provoking. I can understand why someone might find it to be jarring, but I didn't find it to be that at all. I think that it fit just fine in the movie and it is one of the things which made John Coffey such a great character. It immediately made me become drawn to him and the film becomes much more interesting once he gets introduced. Also, the ending is thought provoking because it makes the viewer speculate why Paul is living so long. It begs the question whether Paul's gift of living longer is actually a gift or a punishment. It also makes me wonder how long he will live.In mine and many other people's opinions, John Coffey's death is the saddest movie death scene of all time. It was not only fleshed out very well, but it was also proved that John Coffey was innocent. This isn't the first film to have a wrongly convicted convict, but it is definitely the film which fleshed it out the most and made the nature of it hit the hardest. Also, the scene when he dies is very sad since it has numerous things in it which can make the viewer feel sad. It could be his last words, it could be the fact that Paul was hesitant to give the final order, it could be the part when he shakes his hand goodbye, or several other things which happen in it.Despite everything I said so far, the movie is not perfect. The issues in it mainly rely on its pacing and length. Its pacing flaws are most noticeable in the first act as it takes way too long for John's gift to be introduced as the movie deals with numerous sub-plots first and it takes way too long to introduce us to all of the characters. The movie introduces us as to how Percy loses his temper easily by having him break someone's fingers, it shows us a flashback of John being caught, it introduces us to the Warden and his wife, it shows the guards find a mouse and let Del keep it as a pet, it shows another execution, and many other scenes. Also, I felt like it sometimes took a long time for the movie to move along near the middle of it and some parts of it seemed bland. The pacing and length needed work, but that's my only major complaint with the film.Despite the pacing and length, The Green Mile was well worth my time. It was an emotionally absorbing experience with well-developed characters that I cared for greatly. This is the kind of a movie where you keep on rooting for a happy ending even though you know that it's probably going to have a tragic one. I also really liked the fantasy aspect to it, and it made the movie very interesting and the ending somewhat thought provoking and even more poignant. It's not going to be replacing The Shawshank Redemption anytime soon, but I still recommend it and I think that it is worth your time.",6,0,1,29 January 2016
Jaws," A movie which created the summer blockbuster
","Many if not all shark movies are garbage. But Jaws is the movie which does the shark formula right. After a girl gets dragged under water, pieces of her wash up and people start investigating what happened only to find out that a man eating shark is in the water. This movie has so many memorable scenes and every time someone goes to a beach, people always do the music to annoy you. Jaws is a truly brilliant film which is often called one of the greatest American films ever made. AFI put it at number 56 in their list of the 100 greatest movies. This is a truly brilliant film and it's considered the first true summer blockbuster. Many of its scenes are highly iconic and some scenes left a permanent mark in movie history as we know it. The 3 characters who went to kill the shark all had terrific performances. This is one of those films that about every kid knows about. This movie is so quotable and I could recite many famous quotes from the movie. Even though the shark looks artificial and fake nowadays, there's no denying that the film had an enormous impact on cinema. This movie made everyone fear the water and it will likely be watched for many generations.",9,4,6,2 April 2015
The Wrestler," A moving story about passion with great acting
",This is a great film topped off by Mickey Rourke's outstanding performance. It's about a wrestler who is forced to stop his career because he might die of a heart attack. The film shows him struggling to find something else in life he likes doing. He then meets an exotic dancer who he falls in love with who is also ready to start a new life. His acting performance is definitely one of the more iconic ones of the last couple decades. The movie is about his struggle to move on with life and his new found girlfriend and his daughter both give him courage to move on and we can sympathize with him. The ending is ambiguous and it leaves room for discussion so the viewer can decide whether ending he prefers. I'm not going to spoil the ending but it makes us think if he made the right or wrong choice so I appreciate the choice the film made. I don't think younger audiences would be able to relate with Randy 'The Ram' because it contains some deep concepts but older people would likely be able to relate with him and enjoy the movie more. If you like wresting and want to see a moving story about passion then this movie is for you.,8,1,1,5 April 2015
The Lion King," One of the most important animated films ever
","This is one of the most popular and important Disney animated movies of all time. It's dark, emotionally stirring, and hard to watch at times. It has a great story about revenge and although the plot isn't entirely original, the movie handles it so well that it didn't bother me. The intro is very memorable and it will forever be remembered as one of the best movie intros of all time. I'm not going to spoil anything but a particular characters death is handled so well that it made most people cry bitter tears regardless of their age. It's probably the most saddest scene for any animated film. Like most Disney animated films, it offered adult themes which makes it good and enjoyable for grown ups as well. With some Disney films my nostalgia wears off but with this film, it gets better every time I watch it. Its final act has more action then you'd expect to find in a Disney film. I did rather enjoy the ending scene. Also, it has one of if not the best movie soundtrack of all time too. It perfectly fit the mood and setting of the movie and it's pretty catchy. It's a must see for all animated movie fans,",7,0,1,29 March 2015
Inception," This is nothing more than a decent sci-fi/action flick with a few flaws
","Inception is an entertaining, mind blowing summer blockbuster which I thought was average.This is about a thief who has the ability to access someone's dreams and steal info from them. After, he goes on one final mission, it becomes complicated as an outside force attempts to stop him and his team.This is a mostly astonishing film. It requires the audience to remain on the edge of their seats in its entirety. Many modern summer blockbusters are thoughtless and hollow. It's great to see something of its complexity come out this time of the year. It's real refreshing.The action is magnificent. It's done in a great way and the movie utilizes the dreams to make truly visually spectacular scenes. Some of the best scenes include the zero gravity fight in the hallway and the van falling into the river in slow motion.Although it's easy to get lost in Inception's plot, Christopher Nolan doesn't expect you to understand every element of this film. You just have to understand that this is a movie you have to watch again. But it's plot is handled with meticulous care.But this movie isn't the best with character development. At first I was going to ignore this but now that I think of it - what exactly do we know about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character? Most of the other characters were pushed aside and we didn't get any time to connect with them emotionally. The film also had pacing issues as its opening took a while to pick up.Also, a couple of the rules didn't make sense. For instance, the kick. How come no one was woken up after their van was rammed off the road, flipped over several times, and came to a crashing stop below? Also, the introduction of limbo felt pointless. So, if you die in a dream, you end up in limbo. However, if you die in limbo, you wind up back in the dream. What's the threat of going into limbo then?In conclusion, I thought it was alright. It has nice action scenes and a complicated plot. However, I don't think that it's anything else than a good sci-fi/action flick with a few flaws.",5,1,3,20 August 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," A moving story about prison which will change your life
","This is a motivational story about a group of people in prison. It shows them going through many different conflicts. Most of the guards treat them badly and often abuse the inmates. The ugly realities of prison life are realized in the first half hour of the movie. There was strong acting on all parts. It was expertly shot too. It deserves all of the praise it has received. It's been near the top of IMDb's top 10 for years and it's showing no signs of slowing down. It's very moving and it has a lot of character development. It perfectly represents all the struggles that the characters go through. Also, the movie is highly brutal. Especially near the beginning. This isn't for anyone who doesn't like brutality but it's rather fitting in this movie. The way it combined brutality with a highly memorable story makes it something special. It touched me in a way that I cannot describe. Without any doubt, it's the best drama ever and one of the greatest movies of all time.",8,0,0,4 February 2015
Platoon," A great war film which is sad, moving, and violent
","Platoon is often cited as one of the most realistic war films ever made. It's about the true experiences Oliver Stone had in the Vietnam war. It shows war on different levels including men from the same side turning on each other. It has a lot of power because of this and it gives it an emotional aspect. This movie has a lot of heavy material and is sometimes hard to watch at times. The violent battles show the soldiers getting transformed into killing machines after many frightening experiences and close calls they have. The movie both looks and sounds amazing. I really like the film's score. When it's played, it really helps us get immersed in the scenes due to the notes and beats in it. Sure, some of their choices of actors are a bit questionable like putting Charlie Sheen in an emotional role but I didn't seem to mind it that much because they played the roles with such great emotion and power that it didn't seem to bother me. This is a great war film and it will be remembered throughout the ages. It's unforgettable, violent, sad, and moving.",8,3,4,10 April 2015
Halloween," My favorite slasher film
","The slasher genre is probably the most controversial sub-genre of horror movies. Many people instantly dismiss all modern slashers as garbage while other people find a few of them to be enjoyable. Most slasher films I've seen don't impress me that much. However, some of the earlier slasher films I've seen have blown me away. Before I watched 'Halloween', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was my favorite slasher film of all time. However, this film has rightfully stolen its throne.After a boy named Michael Myers is put in a Sanitarium for stabbing his sister to death on Halloween night, he escapes 15 years later to his hometown where he plans to murder people again.As much as I loved it, it isn't for everyone as it takes a while to pick up. Normally, I would criticize its pacing and give it a 7/10. In the case of this film, however, I wouldn't say that its pacing was flawed, because the first half unnerved me just as much as its latter half did (this is extremely hard to accomplish). There were numerous moments where Myers would follow the protagonists around in broad daylight either on foot or while driving. These moments were well-executed, especially since I wasn't aware of what Myers' intentions were. I wasn't sure if he was going to wait until nighttime to kill people or lure people to uninhabited places and kill them during daytime. This uncertainty made its opening work as well as it did. Many of these moments were also well-edited as Myers would often disappear from view when a character would look away from him briefly, heightening the tension.The 2nd half is equally intense. The reason it works so well is because Carpenter constantly teases us numerous times by putting the characters in several claustrophobic situations. There were several moments where a character would be in an uninhabited area, making it easy for Myers to kill that character off. Despite what I suspected, however, Myers didn't strike right away. It was almost like the movie was teasing me. These brilliant moments were so suspenseful that the film didn't feel predictable at all give or take 1 or 2 minor scenes at the most (however, even though I was able to predict Lynda's death, that scene didn't feel flawed, because since it went on for a while, it seemed to tease me like the earlier moments did). So, with that being said, I wouldn't say that predictability is a flaw with this movie at all as the few uncommon moments where I was able to predict the end result still felt unnerving to a great degree.The movie also contained many memorable scenes. The best of which was the opening scene. It was both eerie and disturbing both in the way it was shot and the thought of what went on in it. The movie started off vague, and it left me asking questions about what was going on in the film. As the scene continued on, however, more and more information was revealed. The first person perspective was also a great addition to the scene as it made it more unnerving. Then, the disturbing final shot of the intro stuck with me long into the film. It's one of the most memorable openings to any horror movie I can think of.There were also a few other aspects I liked about it. The first of which was with its soundtrack. Even though it was minimalistic, it was still a catchy and unnerving tune which sent chills down my spine (it was just as good, if not better, than the minimalistic soundtrack of one of Carpenter's later efforts, 'The Thing'). I also liked that the 2 child protagonists weren't annoying (I often get this feeling with other horror movies for some odd reason). I was also glad that the movie never felt over-the-top with its violence. Finally, the ending was immensely chilling.In conclusion, this is the best slasher film I've ever seen. It's likely going to keep this title for a long time as I doubt that any other horror movie director will top this film (or, at least, not for a long time). Carpenter used different techniques to build suspense to make this film a truly unsettling experience. With fantastic buildup and execution, this film left an enormous impact on me. I liked 'The Thing' a bit more, but I'd say that both films are about the same in terms of quality.",9,0,1,25 June 2017
Paths of Glory," A powerful anti-war film
","This is one of the most powerful and moving anti-war films ever made.When 3 soldiers refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superior officer decides to make an example out of them.This movie is thoroughly engaging from start to finish. No parts felt too slow and no parts felt too fast. 88 minutes is a short running time but it is just the right length for this movie.Kubrick was a genius filmmaker and this movie succeeds because of its simple yet very effective story. Its story discusses a very important issue and that's what usually makes a memorable and entertaining film to watch.The ending scene which shows a woman singing in a bar sparked such a human empathy in me that it made me cry. It's quite a sad scene which can make anyone cry.My only issue with this film is that since the combat scenes aren't violent, it doesn't paint an accurate description of battle. War movies involving combat need to be violent.The fact that this is based on true events only makes the story more poignant. It's not one of the best films of the genre, but it's still pretty good. This is a must watch for all fans of Kubrick and the genre.",10,1,4,28 August 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the best horror films
","When hearing about how terrifying Hannibal Lecter is, one would likely be confused after they look up reviews which explain why he works so well. It's really hard to do what Anthony Hopkins did in this film. While most other actors' performances would be likely dismissed as bland and boring, Hopkins nailed his performance so well that he rightfully earned his place amongst the very best movie villains ever put to screen.A serial killer who goes by the name of 'Buffalo Bill' kidnaps and kills women to skin them and make them into coats. An F.B.I. cadet named Clarice Starling has to confide in a cannibalistic serial killer locked up in prison to help her locate him before he kills someone who he recently captured, Catherine Martin.When the viewer is first introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Starling is walking down an ominous hallway. She walks past other criminals locked up. The first few she walk by behave as you would expect. One is smiling and saying 'Hi' to her, and the last one is jumping up at the prison bars. When she gets to the end of the hall, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is standing up and facing her with a blank expression on his face. He is still and motionless. He says 'Good morning' to her calmly. He seems harmless. As Starling continues to talk to him, the viewer has a minor sense of relief for what the film could've thrown at us, but Hopkins' voice gives the viewer a feeling of deception which makes that sense of relief vanish. This is the first time we're introduced to him, and Lecter is able to unnerve the viewer so much by conveying so little. The great scripting and great acting made him quite a memorable character.Seeing his calmer moments on screen are very memorable. However, it leaves you wondering what he's capable of. Eventually, about 2/3 of the way into the film, the viewer gets to see Lecter pop in one of the most horrifying and memorable horror movie scenes of all time. The scene is so unexpected, and the sheer creativity of it is out-and-out disgusting to even think about. Watching the film a second time, it's frightening to find out what could've happened to Clarice Starling if their calm meetings had played out differently. However, it becomes very apparent that he wouldn't harm her as he grows to value her company. He never threatens her, and he always acts helpful and nice to her. Also, after he finds out how they both share similar childhood wounds, the viewer loses suspicion that he'll do something bad to her. Also, it took me a little while to pinpoint how that was a very effective piece of dialogue which got me to actually identify with Hannibal Lecter.It's a great accomplishment that the film gets us to like Hannibal Lecter. The reason is because he helps Starling locate Buffalo Bill which would also save Catherin Martin from him in the process, and he proves to be very helpful to her throughout the film. Also, the audience senses that he won't hurt her. On top of that, Hopkins performance brings wit and style to the character. The character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter succeeds on so many different levels.There are several scenes from the film which work very well at terrifying the viewer. The scene when 'Buffalo Bill' kidnaps Catherine Martin is a believable technique which seems like it would work in real life. It shows how after you get too close to 'Buffalo Bill' for too long, you would reach a point of no return, and by the time you realize that something bad is going to happen, it would already be too late.One of the most memorable kill scenes from horror movies happens near the final 1/3 of the film. I won't spoil it, but it works very well. Earlier in the film, it hinted that something was up after he stole a character's pen. Once you realize what's going to happen, you're left waiting for Lecter to pop as you've waited to see for a long time. The scene is very gory, and the aftermath of it is even more sickening. When you think that the scene's finally over, the film pulls the rug out from under you, and it shows you a creative, yet highly appalling image which likely won't leave your head anytime soon.The scene at the end in Buffalo Bill's was an amazing idea for a climax. It is so suspenseful, and as soon as it starts, you have minimal hope that it will turn out good. Then, director Jonathan Demme adds in one final aspect into the movie to up the tension so high that it's one of the most suspenseful climax's ever for a film. He makes it seem clear that Starling won't go home unless she either gets a miracle or gets badly injured in the process. This scene is terrifying, because of the film's clever manipulation of the visuals and the fact that we've come to really like Starling, and we don't want anything to happen to her.In conclusion, this is definitely a masterpiece, and it's one of the best horror films of all time. Anthony Hopkins' performance was perfect, and this movie should be looked at and studied off of for years to come. Other horror movie directors should study off of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and many actors should definitely try to do what he did. After the viewer witnesses all of the pros that this movie has to offer, it leaves you a brilliant closing scene which lets you go off on a high note. Anyways, I do wish that I could talk about this film longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner.",9,4,8,9 July 2016
Blade Runner," A classic neo-noir and sci-fi film with great themes
","This is a slow moving sci-fi film but it has great themes. It's about a man in the police force who's hired to kill 4 murderous replicants. It's mostly slow-paced but its engaging climax and great production choices are what makes it such a masterpiece. Its themes require audience's to think rather than experience. The voice overs are unnecessary but later cuts are devoid of them. Ridley Scott has proved to be a visionary artist here by producing a bleak society where it's always dark and raining. Its climax serves as an iconic portrayal of 'man vs. machine'. Its climax is very moving and engaging and it's one of the more memorable scenes from the 80's. Then at the last shot, the movie pulls the rug out from under you. I liked the cinematography. It made the movie look bleak and it made the society look like it was dwindling. The acting was strong on all parts especially coming from Harrison Ford. Because of this movie's production choices, I can see why it's as famous as it is today. Unfortunately, it failed at the box office probably because it came out 2 weeks later than E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. But it has become a cult classic and today it's regarded as of the best sci-fi and neo-noir films.",6,5,8,2 May 2015
Trainspotting," A daring film which shows the highs and lows of drug use
","This movie is a reminder of the highs and the absolute lows of heroin use. It is not for the faint of heart, but it's worth viewing as it's well-acted and well-written with great characters.Mark Renton is a heroin addict who loves heroin and its effects on him. After getting into another brush with the law, he tries to quit heroin as he feels like it's having too bad of an impact on him. However, he keeps on being dragged back into it as every attempt he tries, doesn't work for him. As his addiction increases for him, he and his friends experience the many horrors of drug use.What makes this film special and unique is that it's a daring depiction of drug use. It is never too afraid to show the absolute highs of drug use, but it is also not afraid of showing the absolute lows. It isn't afraid to show Renton and his friends having good things happen to them as a result of drug use. However, it also isn't afraid to show the absolute lows and negatives that it brings to you. It contains many sickening images and horrifying hallucinations, especially the 'baby on the ceiling' which is one of the most terrifying scenes I've seen in any movie before. This is a good approach to a drug film because it doesn't take any sides. In this movie, most people are in the issue of drugs in-between. To a non-addict, they will likely see the film as a strong message to them that the consequences are far more worse than the few good things they give you. To an addict, however, the consequences will always seem outweighed by the thrills and benefits that doing the drug gives to them.Mark Renton is played expertly by Ewan McGregor. His performance pretty much sums up the experience and consequences of being on heroin. When he's high on heroin, he sounds like he couldn't be any happier. When he's not high, he both sounds and looks like he doesn't know what to do and he just wants to get high again. Then, when he says 'this will be the last time', he continues to do it and the process continues. He plays his role perfectly and smoothly.Also, Robert Carlyle as Begbie plays a magnificent role as well. He plays an insecure, borderline psychopath who will fight anyone who gets in his way at any chance he gets. His outbreaks in the film are realistic and unnerving and his performance never seems overly-serious and he never overacts in each one of his outbreaks. In one of the scenes near the end, it shows him beat up a man at a bar for accidentally spilling beer on him. The sense of anger on his face and his tone of voice are really unsettling and his facial expression is very haunting and it sticks with the viewer for a long time. These 2 performances stick out the most, but most other performances in the film are great as well.However, what I really love about it is that it's an honest portrayal of the drug scene. People who say that it glorifies drug use are incredibly wrong and need to watch it with a more open eye. However, people who say that it is an anti-drug film are missing its point too. This isn't about the rights and wrongs of drug use. This is about the addict. He doesn't have to be someone who tells us that heroin is bad. In the movie, the drug addict never tells us that drugs are terrible. He just says that he wants to stop doing it.In conclusion, this is a very memorable and a well-made drug film. It's a daring move for it to show the absolute highs and lows of drug use. Also, it has very great acting performances in it as well. I don't think it is as effective as Requiem For a Dream since that movie was mainly focused on the absolute lows and nothing else, but its daring choices are what make it such a great movie which stands out amongst most other drug films.",8,0,1,27 January 2016
Braveheart," An entertaining war film but it could have been better
","Even though this movie is not perfect, it's still a pretty entertaining war thriller which keeps the viewer interested despite the fact that it's almost 3 hours long.After William Wallace's lover is killed, he decides to start an uprising against the cruel English ruler Edward the Longshanks in hopes of inheriting the crown of Scotland for himself.This movie does have many memorable scenes. The 2 battle sequences in the movie are memorable and the ending is also very memorable. This move is very quotable also. It clearly has a few iconic quotes. Examples of the iconic quotes are 'They may take away our land, but they'll never take away out freedom!' and when Mel Gibson yells 'Freedom!' The acting is okay. It isn't the best performance by Mel Gibson but it's also not bad. There are a few cringeworthy moments but not too many. All of the other supporting actors just gave decent performances. They weren't bad but they also weren't very impressive.This movie is clearly violent but sometimes its violence can be distracting because the movie gets a little carried away with its style. Some scenes include a man getting thrown off a platform and getting impaled on a wooden pike and a man getting shot by an arrow in his butt. Those scenes are several others can take the viewer out of certain battle sequences because they are kind of ridiculous.Also, the movie does have its historical inaccuracies. The inaccuracies mainly revolve around the princess of Wales. Granted, the movie would be a little more boring if it didn't include these inaccuracies but the movie still should've tried to find a way around them. I'm sure that it could've been done.But despite what I said, I do feel that this is a pretty entertaining war film. However, I don't think that this is one of the best war films out there and I feel that there are much better ones. I also think that Mel Gibson has made better movies.",4,0,1,21 August 2015
Moon," A simple plot that works very well
","'Moon' is a compelling work of science fiction. It dives into the aspect of a psychological thriller and implements it well. It pays a tribute to classic science fiction movies by combining different elements to make one of the best movies of 2009. Sam Rockwell's great performance drives the movie even more. It starts off like a simple case of cabin fever. But astronaut Sam Bell spirals into madness due to bizarre things he experiences that make him question what's going on. As he discovers more about his surroundings, tension rises as his life becomes more critical. Throughout the whole movie, the viewer constantly thinks what else does the movie have in store for the characters? The movie is somewhat tense throughout. It has a great soundtrack that raises tension even more. The constant feeling of being alone creates a great and chilling atmosphere. It relies on its plot twists but in a different and unique way. Director Duncan Jones has made a great name for himself by this superb work of science fiction.",8,0,2,28 August 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," This is a very violent film which is guaranteed to move you
","This is a somewhat predictable but lovely film which combines an honest look at poverty in India with one of the best love stories in recent years.Jamal who wants to find his long lost love Latika, goes on a game show called 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'. After he's suspected of cheating, he's interrogated and he starts to explain how he knew all the answers.To say that this is expertly shot would be an understatement. It would be nearly impossible for another movie to win 'Best Picture' over it. Every shot is amazing and not a single one seems worse than the last.The clever structure of the film uses the backstory to explain how he knew each of the answers to show what life is like for much of India's population. Even some of the more disturbing things that go on are detailed very well in the movie.The actors all did a great job. Especially the younger cast which is rather surprising considering that this is their first time acting for many of them. They acted well and I was sold in the first 20 minutes.Unfortunately, the film's strength falters near the end. Blaming plot contrivances on 'fate' seemed lazy and the happy ending felt a bit hollow to me. But besides this, this is still a powerful and moving film which will entertain you all throughout it.This is a great movie. It has great acting and it was expertly shot. The movie details violence well and it's handled greatly too. This is Danny Boyle's best movie since Sunshine and Trainspotting.",8,2,3,24 May 2015
Gladiator," Great action and a great technical aspect, but I did not care for any of the characters
","Gladiator was one of the films I grew up with as a kid. However, as I grew older, I stopped watching it, and I've gone several years without watching it. I wanted to check it out to see if I would still like it as much as I did when I was younger. When I finally re-watched it after all these years, I felt like it didn't hold up. Its fighting and technical aspects were very good, but I could not care about Maximus's character.After a Roman general named Maximus is about to become Emperor of Rome, he is betrayed by his brother named Commodus who murders his family. He is forced into slavery where he comes back as a Gladiator and fights his way up to seek his revenge.The action is definitely the highlight of this film. I think that it's really good. The fights aren't choreographed all too well since they have shaky cam, but I think the fights were shot that way on purpose to show how Gladiators fought by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every time a character gets stabbed, you feel the pain as the stab always feels very realistic without ever feeling over-the-top or ridiculous. The Coliseum looks realistic, and it gave the fights a claustrophobic feeling. During one fighting sequence, they were reenacting 'The Battle of Zama'. A large number of Gladiators were in the middle of the Coliseum and they were surrounded by enemies in chariots. Shortly after the battle started, a few Gladiators were quickly killed off, and it gave the fighting a lot of tension after the viewer learned how much of a disadvantage Maximus had. That was my favorite fight scene in the film.Considering that Ridley Scott is usually pretty good with cinematography (Blade Runner and Black Hawk Down), I had no concern about the cinematography, and I expected it to be really good. I was right. The city of Rome was perfectly captured in the film. Many tableau's of Rome and the Coliseum were beautiful to look at. Rome looked vast, majestic, and full of people. Even the CGI shots were impressive and blended into the film seamlessly. They hold up pretty well today. The only issue I have with the film on a technical level was with its soundtrack that was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. Some songs felt like they were ripped off of by many other action films. Especially the parts where it sounded like someone was singing in a different language. I've heard that in many other films before and it's starting to feel a bit unoriginal. Other than that, the film worked pretty well from a technical standpoint.I don't think that Russell Crowe should've won an Oscar. His performance wasn't bad. Crowe himself is fine. However, his role is about as basic as you can get for a tough guy role. Any actor with some talent could've done what he did. Speaking of Maximus's character, I could not care for him at all. He's just dour and dull for the entire film, even before his family is killed off. He's bland and unsympathetic from the get-go, and he only gets more revenge filled as the movie continues on. I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I could not care for his character for that reason. I could not care about any of the other protagonists in the film. When a main character died, I didn't care that much for them as I felt like I had just been introduced to them. Their deaths just sort of came and went by. Also, I was not as moved by its ending as I expected I would be before going into this film.Looking around a bit, I've seen several reviewers bring up that its plot of betrayal and revenge has been done to death. If I felt that way, I would most likely have a bigger issue with sympathizing with Maximus. As of now, however, I can't think of any movies which borrowed its plot line that came out before this one was released, and I have yet to see any reviewers name any films with a similar plot as this one. So, until I do, I'm going to put that criticism aside.In conclusion, I wasn't a fan of this movie. It's a real shame, because I was hoping that I could relive my childhood memories of it. I can appreciate it for impressing me with its action and its technical aspect. The action was definitely the highlight of the film, and Rome was also very beautiful to look at. However, much of it seemed wasted since it failed in the most important area: Its characters. Maximus felt like a very generic shell of a character and he seemed very uninteresting. I will always love Ridley Scott though, even though I disliked one of his most popular films.",4,1,3,7 July 2016
Donnie Darko," An outstanding debut film with a well-thought out plot.
","This is an elaborate and well-thought out movie which is very well-done. It's a great debut film by Richard Kelly.Donnie Darko, a high school student, is visited by a large bunny named Frank that tells him the world is going to end in 28 days. Frank then urges him to perform different dangerous tasks in the days leading up to the calamity.This movie is made great due to its elaborate plot which was clearly well-thought out by the director. I didn't have much trouble understanding the film throughout its entirety but the ending did confuse me. But after re-watching it and looking up a few theories, I was able to get it and I was astonished by how much effort went into it. It is truly well-done.Jake Gyllenhaal clearly steals the show giving a mesmerizing performance. He is able to convey several emotions and draw us in very well. The fact that Donnie Darko's character is brutally honest, troubled, and confused makes him an easy character to sympathize with. All the other actors did a great job too but Gyllenhaal did the best job.One last thing I want to talk about is that usually when people talk about great mind-bending movies, Christopher Nolan is usually brought up the most but I feel that people need to focus on other movies too. Examples of other great movies with elaborate plot include this film, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, Being John Malkovich, The Tree of Life, Primer, Mulholland Drive, Twelve Monkeys, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Shutter Island. If you're a fan of Nolan then you should check these movies out too. I think Nolan is a great director but I don't like how most people ignore other movies with elaborate plots. Some of these are really famous like Fight Club but the audience usually tends to say that Nolan does the best job with movies of this genre. If you enjoy Nolan then you should check these out too. If you don't like them or still prefer Nolan's movies though then that's fine. I'm just giving these as suggestions.So in conclusion, I think that this movie is amazing. Once you know its plot, it will keep you in awe. I think that this is an outstanding movie which you should see.",8,0,2,5 August 2015
Goodfellas," One of the best gangster films ever made
","'The Godfather' is usually called the greatest gangster film ever made. Several films such as 'Scarface', 'The Godfather Part 2', 'Bonnie and Clyde', and 'Pulp Fiction' are rivals to that movie. To me, 'Goodfellas' definitely ranks very high up there. I love both 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas' and I think that both films are masterpieces.This movie follows infamous gangster Henry Hill and his friends as they work their way up in the gangster world. It shows different people and different events he encounters in this film.I just want to start off this review by saying that this movie is incredibly entertaining. It keeps the movie going at an enjoyable pace and it makes the movie very easy to follow. The movie even draws you in right at the beginning with its brilliant opening scene which is now iconic.By far, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is my favorite character in this movie. He is threatening and he seems like the kind of guy that you don't want to mess with. He can lose his temper very easily and if someone annoys him even in the slightest way possible, they risk getting themselves shot and killed. The infamous 'Funny How?' scene near the beginning is definitely one of the most tense scenes in all of cinema history. The audience is left wondering if he'll pop and the silence of the scene makes it more tense. In other words, he basically steals the show.Ray Liotta also gave a fantastic role as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a feeling of innocence all while having a feeling of violence to him. He also loses his temper easily and when he does, those scenes stick with you very long after viewing it.Also, Robert De Niro gave a great performance. Robert De Niro has always been one of if not my favorite actor of all time. I like him for his tough guy roles. In my opinion, his performances in 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull' are some of the best performances ever in cinema. He gave another phenomenal performance in this movie as well even though he's not in the movie as much as you'd expect him to be based on the DVD cover.This movie is based on the true story of Henry Hill and it is adapted from the best-selling book 'Wiseguy'. The book is great but the movie blows it out of the water in every way imaginable. Also, Henry Hill himself actually stated that this movie is about 95% accurate.Also, the movie is very stylish with its dazzling cinematography. The cinematography looks so good mainly because of the lighting and realistic set design in it. On top of that, Scorsese's Copa Cabana shot is a fabulous shot and it has a lot going for it in terms of the long take.In conclusion, this movie hits all the right notes and it is contains everything which I think is mandatory in gangster films. It is easy to follow, it has enjoyable pacing, great acting, and memorable characters. This film is definitely a masterpiece and it definitely ranks up there with some of the best movies ever made.",9,0,1,6 November 2015
Jurassic Park," This film has everything which makes a good sci-fi movie
","This film has everything. Action, tense scenes, great acting, and great cgi. Despite being made over 20 years ago, the dinosaurs still look better then much of today's cgi. The plot is about a group of people going to an island with live dinosaurs. But some of the workers are trying to smuggle embryos off the island and they turn off the power releasing all the dinosaurs. The survivors then have to make it off the island before they get killed. This movie has dozens of memorable scenes which are too many to name all of them but the most memorable for me is when we first see the T-Rex destroy the car. The movie actually explains why the dinosaurs exist and it explains how they made them. Even though this can't happen in reality, it's always impressive for sci-fi films to have the plot have believable elements. Realism isn't necessary but it does make them more interesting to me. The 2nd and 3rd movies weren't that good compared to this one but 'Jurassic World' might be the one that brings back the charm of the original one. This is an outstanding movie and every sci-fi fan needs to see this.",8,0,0,19 February 2015
The Martian," This could be Ridley Scott's comeback
","Ridley Scott is definitely one of the most hit or miss directors out there. 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien' are clearly his most praised works. 'Gladiator' is definitely a classic and it has a pretty big fanbase. Also, some people argue that 'Black Hawk Down' is even on the same level with 'Apocalypse Now' and other classic war films (which by the way, I agree with that statement). However, he has also produced many hated films in the 2000's which have been called major disappointments by many. However, I still had hopes for this one because sci-fi tends to be his strongest genre. My anticipation definitely paid off and 'The Martian' is clearly the best film he's made in a while and it proves that it might be his comeback.After an astronaut gets stranded on Mars after a storm hits his crewmates, he finds out that he must find a way to signal Earth that he is still alive and he has to figure out how to survive until then.There have been a lot of comparisons to last years 'Interstellar'. Unlike 'Interstellar', this film doesn't contain any expositions and it gets right to the inciting incident. Despite this, we never get confused during the film as it doesn't expect us to have read the book. It explains things nicely and the plot flows along smoothly. 'Interstellar' is also very heavy on science. However, this film doesn't focus too much on intricate science concepts and it is a film which can be enjoyed by more people on the first viewing. Also, it is much less bland and its pacing makes it an easier film to watch. So for this reason, I enjoyed it much more than 'Interstellar'.Also, I really enjoyed the visuals. The outside shots gave a great feel about how Mars looked and it made it look like a barren and desolate area. The shots from the ship looked very futuristic and it made the living quarters look super advanced and high tech. The atmosphere in the movie couldn't be much better and it really makes you feel that this film actually was filmed in space. It may not be anything new or groundbreaking in terms of space visuals but I usually don't ever mind that as long as the visuals are not underwhelming and this movies visuals are most certainly not underwhelming at all. They interested me greatly and they looked very realistic.Most of the screen time is focused on Matt Damon in this movie. I felt that he gave a great performance. It may not be anything Oscar-worthy but he still gave a realistic performance. He was the only actor I really noticed for the majority of the movie but that didn't bother me at all because he carried the movie very well by himself.Like most great movies, however, it isn't flawless. The pacing was a bit too slow for me at times and I felt that it could have been cut to 2 hours instead. I also felt that some scenes carried on longer than they had to. However, this didn't bother me all that much and I still enjoyed it a great deal.After 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar' grew very popular, it seems that the space survival genre is starting to become popular and we might see more films like this in the next several years. Hopefully, Ridley Scott learns off of what he did right in this movie so he can apply what he learned and make more great films in the future. I'm not completely sure if this is true but I think that this film might be his comeback into fame and he might make good films again as he once did. This is one of my favorite films so far this year and make sure you see it as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed at all.",7,4,9,29 October 2015
