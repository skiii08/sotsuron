Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Movie of the year
","This, my friends, is probably the funniest movie you have seen in years. Borat captures selected groups of people from a point of view which is rarely seen in movies. This movie has many layers, you can see it just to be entertained(which is what I did) or you can delve deeper into the message. But for entertaining purposes it does it's job excellent! This movie is so funny, it's almost unbelievable. There were actually a guy in the theatre who laughed so hard, he fell of his seat and rolled on the floor laughing! This is an indication of just how funny it is! Don't loose precious time reading this, just go see it asap! :) Cheers",7,2,8,20 November 2006
