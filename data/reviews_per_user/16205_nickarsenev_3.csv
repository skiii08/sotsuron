Lucky Number Slevin," A big mess.
","Lucky Number Slevin reminded me of how much worse are serious bad films than ironic bad films. It started off kinda ok, the dialogues are funny and awkward (in a good way, tho I'm not sure they are even intentionally awkward). But the second half of this film is truly one of the worst cinematographic experiences in my life, I swear to god. They made a huge (or so it seems at first) plot and all they do for like 30 minutes is explain the plot with the mouths of their characters. Not even kidding, and with that - the plot is also pretty predictable. This is like a new genre - kids detective movies. Stupid, corny, utterly boring.
I don't know why they had to get Bruce Willis for this. Bruce Willis (Mr. Goodkat or whatever) has the same scene over again in this film. The scene goes like this - something is happening and then he walks in very silently as some dramatic music starts to play. I swear to god that's almost all he does in this film. Like Bruce Willis is a genuinely good actor, he CAN ACT. It's beyond me why would they even have a character like Mr. GoOdKaT, who must be the most boring assassin in the history of cinematography.
Also the joke about black people and jews must be one of the worst things about this film. I'm not a social activist or a postcolonialist, but this film is very lazy with the stereotypes, it was genuine cringe during the scenes with Saul, Abe, Elvis and Sloe. Lucy Liu... I don't understand why this film needed a love storyline. How can you mess up a film so much?
I don't even want to know the background of this, I don't want to know who wrote this and who filmed this. This is like if David Fincher went insane and started filming with his toes.
Seriously, if you want something that's kinda like this but good - you should watch Se7en.

Edward Scissorhands," Pretty good.
","The performances are great, I'm sure the cast have done everything Tim Burton asked of them and it was easy enough.Edward Scissorhands is a beautiful fairytale, for sure. And it should be viewed upon as such. But at times this film gets a lot more corny than it should be (imho ofcourse). All the scenes where Edward does his 'magic' with bushes, neighbors' hairstyles and dogs look exactly like that - him moving his hands around while leaves, hair and flakes of fur fly around him in enormous amounts. Makes you feel almost as if it's a kids movie or even a cartoon, which it isn't, I don't think (?). Otherwise, stylistically it is not bad at all.I remember when I first saw this film (at the age of about 6) I cried myself to sleep because of how tragic Edward's fate was. Rewatching it now, as an adult, I didn't feel but rather acknowledged the tragedy. Which isn't necessarily Edward's fault, sometimes throught the film Johnny Depp makes you feel genuine compassion for him. But mostly it's just a fun character to observe.One thing I like about this movie is how Burton made it pretty easy for the viewer to connect with Edward, who we know nothing about and might not even be human, but, nevertheless, is adorable. And how Burton made it even easier to despise the villagers, who marginalize Edward any way they possibly could. Something Woody Allen also does great I think, the director has a lot of characters throughout different films who are so easy to hate. Imo it take a lot of cleverness from both the director and the actors to achieve this effect.Edward Scissorhands could've been a masterpiece, but unfortunately it's not. Still a pretty good film. 7/10. October 16, 2019.",7,2,2,16 October 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick.
","Stanley Kubrick was a genius... of sort?What is Eyes Wide Shut about? Is it about moral decay of the upper class? Is it about marriage ? Is it about jealousy? Is it about the rules of society (something like 'there's always a bigger fish') or about secret masonic-illuminati clubs? I often hear people say about different directors/authors that 'His/her films/books are about everything'. Well if someone filmed about everything - it was Kubrick, for sure. Eyes Wide Shut, just as Space Odyssey, just as Full Metal Jacket, - is about everything and about nothing at the same time. It's open for interpretations and almost every viewer will, most likely, even unwillingly, interpret it in their own personal way. I say 'almost' because Eyes Wide Shut is a long film, as most of Kubrick's works, and many people just don't get sucked in by it as much as Kubrick adorers do. And this film is a trance even more than the rest Kubrick films (apart from 2001, perhaps).Now, a lot of people call Stanley Kubrick a stylist. I'm not sure I can agree with that most of the times. He was sophisticated and precise in what he wanted the viewer to be able to see in the shot and where he wants the viewer's attention. But at the same time his films feel almost raw. The shots are very simple. And this is especially the case with Eyes Wide Shut.Still, the ritual scene is one of my favorite scenes of all time. I don't know why. Can't even explain it as, again, it's not stylish or tricky in any way, but I just love it.The conspiracy thery about Kubrick's death, the 'seized by the studio' 24 minutes of the film etc. was on my mind almost the whole time I was thinking about Eyes Wide Shut and rewatching it. I don't know and I'm sure that not a lot do know about how many of this is true, but I still imagine how perfect it could've been with all the missing scenes (if they exist). I must say that I had a feeling that the movie is kind of incomplete after I've seen it the first time, not knowing about the WB-Illuminati shinenigans at all. And rewatching it again made me feel even more like it.Regardless of if it was on purpose by Kubrick or not, I'd love to literally see more of this film, I'd love for it to continue and not to end on such a teasing note, almost mocking me as a viewer (and a man!). Otherwise, not my favorite film by Kubrick, but certainly not less deep than all the others. I was born 6 months after Stanley Kubrick died but I still miss him. 8/10. October 16, 2019.P.S. Lots of naked girls in this film. And I mean LOTS of em. Be aware.",8,0,0,16 October 2019
