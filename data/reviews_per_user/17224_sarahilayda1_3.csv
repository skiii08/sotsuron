Hereditary," Disappointing Yet Interesting
","OK, I had to admit that I had good expectations about this movie like I had for The VVitch and Mother!. I'm very disappointed for those as well. I think they share similar problems. That goes without saying, if you liked The VVitch you will like this movie.I'm going to list the things I liked first. 
-Acting was great except Toni's in my opinion. She was too over the top almost hysteric at times but understandable acting/directing choice, it's my personal opinion. The little girl was just great.-Editing and cinematography. I think this movie could get an Oscar or Golden Globe nomination for editing or cinematography. I especially enjoyed editing since some shot transitions were flawless.-Doesn't have any jumpscares and doesn't rely on traditional scare tactics, and still is interesting. -Story is kind of interesting but I think negatives out weight positives.Let's come to things I did not enjoy.-This movie is extremely slow like The VVitch, most shots are pointless and do not serve the story. If they could've stick to 90 mins I think the story would be much more enjoyable since at many moments I was like 'When will something, anything happen'. And when something does happen you need to wait another half an hour for the next thing, its painfully slow for that story. I think they were trying to fill time frames for the lack of story with good cinematography which is a shame. -Story is NOTHING new. I knew what it was going to be about from the beginning and when it got a little bit interesting it got dull again. The plot of this movie can be summarised by 3 sentences and even that is too little for a horror movie. It gives you basically no explanation about who the people are, why are they doing what they're doing and what is their end-game. The story is suffering from same thing with The VVitch. There is a basic idea and an execution but no quality.-They're trying too hard to be good. In my opinion, a good horror movie is more than jumpscares and other stuff, it's it's story and acting. Like I really enjoyed Before I Wake which isn't your traditional horror and Annanelle:Creation which is. But this movie is just like 'OK let's be artsy and try to do something mysterious' but it fails. It's not artsy nor mysterious. Ending is a complete fail as well.Overall my recommendation is watch it with little to no expectations. I do think it's worth a watch but if you'll have any expectations you will be disappointed. UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY LIKED THE VVITCH. Then go watch right now.",6,0,1,9 September 2018
The Danish Girl," Vikander (Gerda) carries the movie.
","I liked the movie, I like the movies that has strong messages and I truly appreciate biographies and this is an amazing and inspiring story of Lili aka Einar Wegener and Gerda Wegener. It's about the struggle of Eniar when he tries to embrace and find his true sexual identity while his wife, Gerda tries to help and preserve their marriage. Personally I think the supporting lead, Alicia Vikander(Gerda) who got an Oscar for it, carries the whole movie. I've found Eddie Redmayne (Lili) dull and simply plain. He could've make us feel the struggles of finding the sexuality in a more effective way considering it wasn't 21st century, it was 1920's. It was not common or normal. He seemed to be in Lili rather than Einar too like he never lived as Einar in his life.But the story is inspired by the true people, and their story is actually what the movie tells us. Costumes, hair and make up and production is on point. But I just think Eddie and the screenplay is a bit dull, it could've written in a more emotional way. They could've make something amazing with the story they had, but it ended up as a okay drama movie with a great pilot.",7,0,1,4 March 2016
Gran Torino," A series of unrealistic decisions.
","I started watching this film with absolutely no expectations.It started quite mild, not fast paced. We've got introduced to the characters, to the culture of the neighbors and we started having sweet moments by the mid-way of the film. We see our MC's getting bullied and this old man standing up for them and we see their relationship growing and then the collide happens. That event that changes the whole film happens, and boy, it was upsetting.And then, the film goes mental. I could not sense any realism of any of the character's choices. I will reason it in below, I'm keeping this part spoiler free. And by then, the film has lost me. One unreasonable action after an another. The ending is predictable and not emotional considering how emotional and touching it should have been.In conclusion, this film is an enjoyable and worth watching even though the ending sucks. I do not regret watching it but I would not recommend or watch it again.------ Spoiler -------Girl and the white boyfriend walks then this gang shows and start abusing your girlfriend, you don't leave! You stand up especially if you're living in a hood, come on.If this gang of your relatives shoots at your house, injures your son and gang rapes and beats your daughter, a mother, a grandmother would testify. It makes absolutely no sense that they would not co- operate. And what about the neighbors? There would be at least one eye- witness. He could've gone to the police and testify as well but nope, he will not cause f*** the police right? He has license plate, people have heard the shots, has no reason to lie.Then he goes and decides to go on this suicide mission to save them? Good for you man! It makes absolutely no. sense. I get that he wanted to retire and this was supposed to symbolize his retirement and he wanted to go as a hero but it feels fake and forced. And what about that focusing on the grand-daughter when the lawyer was reading his will, how fake was that? It also forced and fake. We know she won't get the car, there is absolutely no reason to focus on her. This film could've been way better if they would've put more thought on it considering %70 of the film was actually very enjoyable.",7,1,3,30 August 2017
