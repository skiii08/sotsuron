Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is Back
","As a long-time Star Wars fan, this movie had been the center of my attention for quite a while.  I feel I should add that George Lucas is the man for releasing this film on my birthday.  That aside, I am very happy with this film.  Of the original three films, it reminds me the most of Episode IV. It was more of an adventure movie than the previous ones.  My one complaint is that it was a little too directed at the kids for my taste.  I think that this film just would have been better without all the Jar-Jar stuff and the other silliness, which distracted from the good points of the movie: some great visuals, top-notch performances from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman, and the events that will be important in the next two movies.  Still, I expect that those problems will go away with the next two movies.  This movie left possibilities for the next two, many of them intriguing.  I can very easily see how Obi-Wan (probably my favorite character in the whole saga) became who he is in Episodes IV, V and VI, and how he was rash enough to lose Anakin to the Dark Side along the way.  I look forward to seeing how he -- and all of the major players -- develop.",1,0,1,19 May 1999
JFK," If You Like Conspiracy Theories...
","And not the facts, you'll love this film.  Stone borrows allegations from several prominent theorists and presents them as if they are unimpeachably true.  He also makes up things of his own and throws them in, and you don't know who made up what.  The problem, to me, is that this film is presented as a historical movie.  You expect some errors and dramatic license in those, and those do exist.  But Stone takes the time (3 hours) and style to make JFK seem like a carefully reconstructed docudrama, which it's not.  The '100 Errors in JFK' page aside, there are numerous errors in logic made by Stone, and the fictions stand next to the facts.That's my big problem with the film: not that it pushes theories that are totally false, which it does, but that it relies on the ignorance of its audience to get by.  If conspiracy theories weren't so much more popular than the truth, I think a lot of  people would have been unable to stomach the way Stone attacks dead people who are innocent but unable to defend themselves, like Clay Shaw and David Ferrie.  I found myself disgusted by the way they were treated in the film.  They're not fictional characters, they were real people, and Stone is making a buck off the fact that millions of people have been fooled into thinking they murdered John F. Kennedy. Most of that fooling was done by Jim Garrison and his whacko crusade, and by guys like Fletcher Prouty, who were heavily involved with the film. Garrison isn't a hero, and he doesn't deserve the treatment he gets either. I wish I could evaluate the film more on its own merits- it's dramatic, if overlong.  I enjoyed Donald Sutherland's scenes despite my disagreement with their point.  As a film, it's a mixed bag, with some strong points and some weak ones.  As history, it's worse than bad, it's outright dishonest.",2,13,36,17 December 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Unbelievable; visionary
","I have seen 2001 all of twice now, but I will never cease to marvel at what an astounding accomplishment it is.  I have never seen a film with such amazing vision.  Everything in it seems so incredibly well and completely though out.  Kubrick is, no question, the bravest director I've ever seen. What other director would have an overture, intermission, entre'acte and exit music now?  The space sequences are truly silent, whereas Armageddon, for example, fills it with useless noise.  It gives the real feeling of a void, a vacuum, of emptiness and infinity itself.  2001 is a visual opera. It tests the limits of cinema and the very imagination.  I have never seen another movie that required real existential discussion afterwards.  This movie, though it is over 30 years old, has the greatest special effects of any ever.  The ending sequence may be the greatest 20 minutes ever captured on film.  The title is perfect: 'Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.'  How it was done is beyond me.  How Kubrick could have ever even imagined it is totally beyond me.  I would say right now that this is the greatest film I have ever seen.  It is a masterpiece.  The film world is immeasurably poorer without Kubrick, but it owes him an eternal debt.",10,3,5,15 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Amazing. Absolutely amazing.
","This movie may well be Stanley Kubrick's best.  Like his other movies -- maybe even more so -- this one is a diamond, and Kubrick wore the jeweler's glass. Every facet, every detail seems to have been considered and carefully calculated.  The colors and the sets -- both of which are incredible -- stand out in this regard.  Each one means something and expresses it.  The score is the same way -- to me, it surpasses even the Psycho score in its contribution to the more frightening moments of the movie.  Towards the end of the film -- at the climax, in fact, when I should have been used to it -- I jumped at those piano shrieks.  Twice.  When this movie decided to be scary, it was the most scary and disturbing movie I have ever seen. The sex in this movie -- though I think it is a study of sex -- is of secondary note.  This is not a porno, and the sex in it is not steamy or sexual.  Most of it is downright eerie. If this movie does not win at least two Oscars -- Best Picture and Best Director (neither of which a Kubrick film has ever won, much to my astonishment) -- I will never pay attention to the academy again, because this will be final proof that it has no taste.  Also, I have learned two things about the censoring of this picture: (1) Kubrick realized that he would have to add the digital characters to get an R rating, and planned to do so.  Though they were added after he died, it was according to his wishes, and (2) I didn't even notice the digitally added characters. They affected the movie or the scene in no way at all.  Though the MPAA are Puritannical Retards, and I am disappointed that I live in the only country in the world that made him add these things, even the MPAA could not damage Kubrick's work.  Besides, I am sure that an NC-17 version will at least come out on video, and that will settle that. This final film -- most aptly described by Janet Maslin as 'haunting' -- gets an 11 from me.  Kubrick was entirely in a class by himself.  The film is forever diminished by his loss, but at least he left us with a collection of movies to watch in awe forever.  Eyes Wide Shut is definitely a worthy addition to this collection.  Thank you, Stanley.",10,0,0,21 July 1999
Titanic," Greatest ever? Tell me another one.
","This movie might well be the most over-rated film of all time.  It had a few good points -- foremost among which was the cinematography -- but these were overshadowed by the shortcomings of the movie and the ludicrous hype that surrounded it.  The film is full of stock characters, with the stereotypical and cliched Jack and Rose being the most prominent examples.  The entire movie was as predictable as the boat sinking at the end.  The dialogue is sub-par, to say the least.  The movie drags on and on forever.  The scenes in the present, for example, were totally superfluous.  I remember watching the boat leave dock and staring at my watch, not believing that I'd only been there for half an hour.  And then the movie, like the boat, just kept going.  After the ship hits the iceberg, the movie improves -- it doesn't have time to waste, so it can't waste it.  Even here, though, there were just a few too many last-minute rescues for my taste. This movie tries to attain the epic quality of 'Gone with the Wind,' but it simply can't do it.  It has very little substance, and lacks the art of that film -- an actual classic.  If 'Gone with the Wind' is a bit soap-operatic -- a fair criticism, I think -- then sitting through 'Titanic' is like sitting through all 20 years of 'As the World Turns' in one sitting.  It is not an epic, it is simply long -- too long, and pretentious.  This is the ultimate Hollywood movie in that it has so little too offer, and yet somehow it cleaned up at the Oscars, wins all kinds of undue praise, and heap money on it until it becomes the highest-grossing movie ever.  I hope that, box-office records aside, this movie does not remain famous, or keep this silly reputation of being a classic.  It does not have the quality of any of the great films it is often compared to.  It is big-budget fluff. One final point: on the voting scale, I gave this movie a '1.'  And I will be honest: it is not quite that bad.  It could be '2' or even '3' material. But the way some people talk about this movie absolutely drives me crazy. It is not a great love story, it simply imitates a lot of other ones.  It is a product.  It is a huge studio production without very much heart or brains behind it.  I find it very sad the way this movie (and its male star, who at this very moment is trying to trademark his name) have been made into such golden calves.  'Titanic' exemplifies the era of big-budget fluff that present-day movie-fans have to deal with.  Once people stop buying into movies like this, actual quality may return to film.  I only hope that that day comes soon.",1,4,115,2 August 1999
