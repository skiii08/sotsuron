Alien 3," Worst of the Franchise? no
","I see nothing but bad reviews and i for one loved this movie, it has a lot of things in common with the original 'alien' being a sequel to 'aliens' it can come across as weaker but it is not, it has one of the greatest movie soundtracks thanks to Mark Isham, a lot of fans where both disgusted and shocked by some of the events in this movie, but for me it was great, and much better than Alien Resurrection for me Alien 3 is the 2nd best of the franchise watch the directors cut and appreciate this great movie it is up there with some of the best horror's, it is a love it or hate it movie but there has to be as many people out there who loved it, thats why i am a bit disappointed to see so many negative reviews, this movie is a classic give it a chance and enjoy it, it's a great sequel to a fantastic film which was 'Aliens'",8,4,62,1 November 2008
