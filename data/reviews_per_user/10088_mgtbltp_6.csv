3:10 to Yuma," Remake has a different emphasis
","spoilers Just got back from the theater, audience was a mixed bag but I did notice a lot of gray haired folks, more than usual, the Western's demographic is definitely in evidence.Over all first impression I'd say that this film was a 8/10, I liked it, it amped up the volume on the action from the original version emphasized different parts of the story while neglecting some others. Its definitely an improvement over the dialog driven TV Westerns of late.But it did have a few faults which I'll enumerate later.It starts out in the ranch house introducing the Evan's family, and this version has Evans with wooden leg which he lost in the Civil War.The whole beginning stage coach hold up was very SW in feel and the action sequences during this were well done and exciting. Wade seeing the coach, despite the heavy attack upon it, beginning to pull away from his crew drives the Evans cattle herd into the road (like in the Original version) to stop it. Ben Foster as the creepy cold blooded gunslinger Charlie Prince dispatches the wounded.The gang rides into Bisbee with their loot. Charlie Prince tells the sheriff about the hold up in the canyon and meets up in the with rest of the gang in the Saloon & their they splits their cash. Most then leave for the nearby Mexican Border. Ben Wade stays behind & seduces a willing Emmy Nelson the bar girl. They go upstairs, make & love. The whole sequence of how Dan Evans & the town sheriff capture Wade in the saloon in this version is totally garbled, in the original it was crystal clear.The Bisbee Sheriff, Butterfield, and Evans plan to take Wade to Contention City pulling a switcheroo (as in the original) at the Evans Ranch. A new twist for the story is having the oldest son of Evans join the party escorting Wade.The new version spends a lot of time on the trail adding more action that is all pretty good also has an added sequence at the rail camp where a work crew is blasting tunnels for a new rail line.At Contention the whole sequence of taking Wade from the Hotel to the Station was again amped up by the device of having Charlie Prince offer the town folk a bounty on the sheriffs posse (believable?, no) but the result is a grand shootout as Evans & Wade make a run for the station.The actual 3:10 coming into Contention was anti-climatic in this version.Over all the town sets and costuming all looked fantastic Flaws: The biggest first, 40% of the movie was missing. I don't remember to much of a score and I sorely miss the hypnotizing Spanish guitar from the original version. That was Wades leitmotif and this was a big mistake, it lent an extra dimension to all Wades dialogs & actions.A bit PC, remember the original and the smoke filled bar, I don't think I saw anybody smoking, give me a break.Initial Western Feel. The whole beginning Evans family sequence doesn't evoke 'The West'. It needed an establishing landscape shot, then the Evans & just a bit more lingering on landscape shots it did have, but the cutaways seemed to come to fast.Chronologically it pushed the envelope a bit . Evans looked what, 30 - 35 tops, he's supposed to have lost his leg during the Civil War, so he would have had to been young, 17, and the year 1864 at the time to make him 35 + by mid 1880's (when the Southern Pacific was running) its a minor quibble. They could just as easily have said he lost it in the Indian Wars.The story line got garbled, it was crisp & clear and humorous (the bit with the town drunk) in the original version how Wade got captured this version fowled this up. I still think Ford & Farr did a better job with their sequence.Both versions still suffer from the endings neither is all that satisfying or believable but this new version has much more action. I would have thought though (from the prowess displayed by the marksman on Wades gang during the stagecoach holdup) that he would have easily snipered out Evans on his break for the station with Wade. It would have been better to do the break for the station the way it was done in 'Last Train From Gun Hill' , ie. Evans holding a scatter gun under Wades chin.It needed more train shots too, but thats me.",6,2,5,8 September 2007
Public Enemies," Less pseudo reality more myth & legend
","The cinematography it had an uneven look definitely due to the HD digital, the biggest noticeable contrast being the Little Bohemia shootout with the rest of the film. The hand held camera-work was way overdone, there was no reason for it in certain scenes particularity during the night club sequence where you had Billie & John tête-à-tête conversing, why, why must the picture be bouncing up and down? Why when Bille is captured do we get a munchkin POV looking up? What's the point of that? Now some complain about this effect making them nauseous for me it just makes me annoyed. I think minimal use in key segments could accent certain sequences but when its continuous it becomes redundant. It also robs us of the appreciation of the props and the art of set design, if everything is a blur or constantly bouncing about it makes set design an exercise in futility. What is the point of showing beautifully restored automobiles as a bouncing blur, at least the shot of the steam engine arriving at the station seemed not to be not hand held. The whole effect gives me a feeling of what I assume someone with HAADD would experience.There is a current trend in Hollywood in making certain Genres into, historical costume dramas, almost docudramas when dealing with the past, its the same in the Western Genre trying for too much reality takes away the magic of the Western iconography built up over the years. Westerns were about Myths and Legends same as the old Gangster Genre films. Too much reality is killing Westerns and you can see this to some extent in Public Enemies. In the schizophrenic Public Enemies we get a bit more detail and emphasis on accuracy in some areas and then wild fabrications in others but what is lacking in this film is the small touches that give some character development to Dillinger's gang they seemed to all blend in to a blur and the same likewise could be said of the FBI team. Public Enemies spent a bit more time with the Billie-John relationship at the expense of the 'Public Enemies', but I somehow get the feeling that that(Billie-John) was all contrived Hollywood BS anyway.The little extra vignettes that the 1973 Milius' Dillinger had gave a bit of character development to the legend of Dillinger's gang, the gumball machine, Dillinger's visits to his family, Dillinger's sister, the bar scene, Dillinger splitting the money from the robbery that he did at his jail escape with the mechanic the warden and Reese, Purvis' vow of smoking his gift cigars from his shot down buddy 'over the dead bodies of every one' of the public enemies gave Dillinger that mythic Gangster Film cachet. Were any of these historical, possibly, but others particularly Purvis was wildly inaccurate. But a larger than life Dillinger needed a larger than life Purvis. In Public enemies neither Dillinger nor Purvis really reaches Iconic status. It also helped that the character actors in Milius' Dillinger were well enough known and in enough prior films to be distinguishable from one another and add gravitas to their roles. When the legend becomes fact film the legend was Milius's MO.Now let us examine how the two films handled the Little Bohemia Shootout. In Dillinger the FBI arrive just at dawn and the shootout commences when three hapless innocents walk out of the lodge all the action is in the light. In Public Enemies Mann stages the shootout at night the action being ignited by three men leaving the lodge in a car.Now I'll digress for a moment, let me tell you a little parable, there once was a survey leveling crew on a survey project that was working on the edge of the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area in Montana. They were running a level circuit on a construction P-line and decided to try and finish the three mile project before sunset and the ensuing darkness. In short they didn't make it, finding themselves about 2.5 miles from the existing road on a steep fir pine and spruce covered hillside, and had to continue walking out carrying their equipment. When it got dark it got DARK under the tree cover, pitch black, as if you were in a closet. Besides obviously trees everywhere there was also blow down, underbrush etc., etc., to negotiate around and through. They could not walk normally they had to feel ahead with their feet for any obstacles in their way at the pace of a crawl. Every once in a while they would break into a natural clearing and a sliver of moon lit it up enough so that you could see but as soon as the hit the tree line on the other side again in was back into the abyss.There is no F-ing way in Public Enemies that anybody is going to be running around in the frickin dark through the woods, its totally ridiculous you would be slamming into trees tripping over logs etc., etc. Its just not believable, but the muzzle flashes of the Tommy guns looked nice, lol. Apparently that is what he was going for.The film overall was entertaining but it could have been way more than it is, it needed a tad more myth and less reality. 6.5-7/10",7,2,4,4 July 2009
L.A. Confidential," Close but no fedora
","I discovered James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet series of novels, The Black Dahlia (1987), The Big Nowhere (1988), L.A. Confidential (1990), and White Jazz (1992) while living in Montana after a sort of cold turkey I experienced when I had devoured all of the Dashiell Hammett's, James M. Cain's, Ross MacDonald's, and Raymond Chandler's I could at that time get my hands on. They were all great reads, but unfortunately, this was before I really began to appreciate Film Noir and get a stylistic visual from those series of films of the world Ellroy was depicting. Of course I had seen 'The Maltese Falcon', 'The Big Sleep', 'Double Indemnity' and 'Murder My Sweet' but they were made before the neo- realistic phase of the Noir series so they didn't really count. L.A. Confidential according to Curtis Hanson was an attempt to depict '50's LA but not in a stylistically noir way, 'no long shadows' so they consciously decided to show the '50's looking forward towards the future rather than highlight Film Noir. He needn't have bothered, the widescreen alone effectively negates the claustrophobic noir stylistic. Noirs were mostly about urban alienation and obsession, the majority of urban topography is vertical which suited the 3:4 aspect ratio well. But, what L..A Confidential does is incorporate Los Angeles' overall elongated horizontal urban structure into an effective neo noir. A plus is that the film even incorporates more actual 50's LA locations and interiors than for example the film Chinatown (story line circa 1930's) did, though this could be for the simple fact that way less 30's LA was still extant in 1973 than 50's LA in 1996. What locations they didn't have they reconstructed and the blend is seamless. The film looks that good.whats not to like:However one glaring WTF omission is what I like to call the 'romance of the fedora' aside from the DeVitos' character Sid Hudgens and James Cromwell's Dudley Smith, fedoras are absent, missing in action. It just doesn't feel quite right, it would be sort of on par with making a Western without cowboy hats, the characters look naked. -1OK I can understand somewhat where Hanson is coming from in a commentary he states that he wanted to make a film that didn't feel like a period piece because he was concerned about getting funding, but you could at least have had 1/4 of the cast wear fedoras and one of the leads. The Author James Ellroy on his commentary on the DVD for Crime Wave 'Sterling Hayden-- That is my Bud White. That is my Bud White! 'F' Russell Crowe in 'L A Confidential.' I mean he was okay, but he's a shrimpy little sh-t Bud White as Bud Whites go. Sterling Hayden is the real deal. Look at this! He's not even acting. Look at that hat!' 'nuff said.'The Lynn Bracken/Bud White romance wasn't all that convincing didn't seem to be any chemistry there it needed more time to get fleshed out at least.If this film really wanted to be a neo noir masterpiece it didn't have confidence or the nerve to push that envelope, Hanson's reluctance to embrace Noir and go with the safe money gives us at the denouement the happy Hollywood ending. The bad guys are all dead and 2/3 of the good guys live. -1 final score 8/10",8,0,1,14 January 2013
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," More comedy than western
","Could never understand why it is considered a classic western since it is more of a comedy in a western setting. I put it in the class with 'Support Your Local Sheriff/Gunfighter' 'The Halileua Trail' and 'Cat Balou' . But for some folks I suppose this was their idea of a good western. It is a funny comedy. It did lack for the classic cliche mud puddle fight.Perhaps the chemistry of Redford and Newman made it as popular as it was at the time. It sketched the story of Butch Cassidy and the Hole in the Wall Gang just barely, and it would be nice to see a gritty retelling of their story.The 'Raindrops' sequence didn't fit at all, for the western genre but if you view it as a comedy then maybe.",5,2,5,11 January 2004
Duck You Sucker," Leone's last great (Zapata) Western
","Well I must admit that seeing this for the first time on the new pristine R1, wide screen SE DVD, with the original 'mono' audio was a revelation. In 1970 I left New York City for first the Adirondacks, and then Montana, so my easy access to the theaters on Times Square was eliminated and the ability to be aware of much less be able to see the Spaghetti Westerns that occasionally graced the big screens in double & triple bills was curtailed.My previous viewing experiences with this film were once on a 70's or 80's VHS tape and then dribs and drabs that I caught from time to time while switching through channels on TV. In regards to the Pan & Scan and commercial breached versions my reaction to Rod Steigers performance was decidedly negative. It seems in retrospect that the combination of cuts, trimmed scenes, and commercial breaks, emphasized the clownish facial expressions and exaggerated his accent while negating the serious side of his performance. Now viewed as a whole his performance becomes more easy flowing and contiguous. You realize that Steiger was playing Juan as a cagey Mexican bandito playing the fool when the situation required it and reverting back at the drop of a hat back to bandit leader. With James Coburn's performance I never had an issue.I'm also mature enough now to see that this was a transitional film for Leone not only as a complete film but it was transforming before our eyes. I can see now why it tanked in the US. In Europe I believe you had the luxury of getting served your Leone in well paced over time releases, you had the opportunity to savor and enjoy and digest each and were ready to see what the maestro would serve up next. We 'kids' here in the US were blasted by both barrels in 1967 when both 'A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For A Few Dollars More' premiered within months of each other, and then theaters ran double bills for months at a time. Within a year 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly' also hit the theaters and we were totally immersed in the Leone style and eager for more of the same, I think we may have been under the impression that these films were similar to the James Bond franchise where a successful formula would be repeated over & over.'Once Upon A Time in The West' was a totally different animal it did not star Clint Eastwood (which was the way the dollars trilogy was promoted (strike one) it was misunderstood upon release and panned by the critics who did not understand its nature(strike two) it was then re-cut (Strike three) and released widely to a quick demise.'Duck You Sucker' not really a traditional Western never had a chance, it was Leone's reaction to the Zapata Westerns that never did have a wide showcase or following here in the US, his quotes & references to these Zapatas would have flown over the heads of most. While Leones previous 'Dollars' films were just fun adventures, and 'OUTITW' was an homage Western about Westerns, this film had a Leone message, a statement, it was not only that 'Revolution is Confusion' but also to 'keep your head down' (Duck You Sucker) and stay out of politics, because only the people who read books survive the poor who do the fighting and make the changes end up dead.There are the comedy elements from his previous films juxtaposed with serious new depths to his characters, the beginning of DYS is very reminiscent to GBU and the cat and mouse games played between Tuco and Blondie are reflected in the Juan/Sean relationship each using the other for opposite purposes. Juan is also the head of his extended family of banditi and all actions are shown to have consequences.I'm pulled buy opposing emotions while watching this film, on one salient I want it to be another grand adventure a la GBU, and that is the way it started out. On another it's not up to the mythic qualities of OUTITW, though it does quote from Einstein's 'Que Vivre Mexico' and the Hollywood tradition of Zapatas, Leone purposely shuns the 'romance of the sombrero' we get no ballads, no soldadas (ie, no beautiful Adelitas or Columbas), no festivals all touchstones of the Italian Zapatas. On still a third salient the film has a very bleak ending. Not exactly a feel good fun to watch over and over.OUTIA Leone's next and last film continues in the mode and is equally beautiful but bleak. a film about melancholy and regret.Morricone's score great as usual I find a just a tad bit uneven, the leitmotif's for Juan and Sean/John are good but the grotto massacre theme just seems a bit to breezy & lighthearted for the images. Listening to the Frayling commentary I have an understanding of what he was attempting.",10,2,5,14 June 2007
True Romance," Once Upon A Time In Detroit
","Once Upon A Time In DetroitA heart beat of Noir.The title sequence for True Romance magically conveys us to the bleak cold desolate vortex of the Rust Belt 1990's Detroit, but also back a million plus years to the time when fantastic tales were spun by ancient man around the first campfire. Only in the here and now, the fire is scrap wood fed and in an oil drum in a vacant lot surrounded by hobos, outcasts, and scavengers and the fantastic tale is offered with rising sparks and smoke up to the eternal night. A Neo Noir tale.Very few of the classic noirs used the female voice over, one that readily comes to mind is Claire Trevor's in Raw Deal. This neo noir story is triggered in one long flashback by a voice over narration by ex-call girl femme fatale Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette). Arquette here is downright outstanding, if ever there was a character that captured that effervescent spirit of Marilyn Monroe's various characters (and updates that quality to the 90s and makes it her own) in a film it's Arquette's Alabama in True Romance. She is a blond, buxom, bombshell, a 'firecracker' the 'shot from the front' sequence where she jiggles down the courthouse steps rivals Marilyn's classic 'shot from behind' wiggles from Some Like It Hot and Niagara. You just sense that if this were still the big studio days and she was under contract she would have been typecast into many of these kind of parts in quick succession at the peak of that phase of her beauty, Arquette might have become iconic but would the price have been tragedy as it was for Marilyn? As it is her performance is just a one off. The studio days are long gone and the atmosphere is catch-as-catch-can and Arquette did not get another similar Neo Noir role until her double parts as Alice & Rene in Lost Highway. I guess time will be the judge if contract stars of the Studios or those of the new corporate deal system will be best remembered in the long run. Arquette here ranges from sweet and coy, to desperate and deadly, her transformation into Athena with her Amazonian like war scream is chilling. The tale unfolds as quasi comic book/martial arts/Elvis geek Clarence gets shot out of the saddle by a B-girl at a local tavern. Later at a late-night triple bill Sonny Chiba show, Alabama, in a contrived maneuver spills her popcorn over the seat on Clarence. She expresses her dismay in an instantly lovable cutesy/ditzy manor and is soon climbing over the seat and settling in beside him. They soon connect and later over pie and coffee in a diner begin to fall for each other. Clarence takes her back to his pad above the comic book store where they make love. Later Alabama confesses that she is a call girl and was paid and sent by Clarence's boss as his birthday present. Clarence is not mad at all says it's the best present he ever had and that it was not just the physical part but he never had so much fun with a girl ever before in his life. They pledge their love for each other and get married. The whole sequence is wonderfully written and rings so true that you suspect it is somewhat biographical. Clarence, (Christian Slater) in probably his best role, watch his dialogs with Alabama and his father. He is 'cooler than cool' as he follows his personal rockabilly espirito Elvis in the way he deals with situations and travels life's highways. . Elvis tells him to confront Alabama's pimp Drexl and it's this meeting that sends the tale spiraling into Noirsville. The rest of the cast is superb, Michael Rapaport as Dick Ritchie a struggling numb nuts want to be actor who lives with stoner Floyd (Brad Pitt) who has a plastic honey bear bong. Bronson Pinchot is the weasel Hollywood yes man Elliot Blitzer to producer Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek). Dennis Hopper is Clifford Worley, Clarence's security guard father who sings Country Western songs while making his rounds and lives in a trailer park wedged between the river and the railroad tracks. Mafioso Don Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken ) is a capo for Blue Lou Boyle. Virgil (James Gandolfini ) is a reflective hit-man. Gary Oldman is delightfully over the top as courier and pimp Drexl Spivey. Chris Penn as Detective Nicky Dimes and  Tom Sizemore as Detective Cody Nicholson are Gung ho LA cops. Samuel L. Jackson is Big Don a spastic druggie with some memorable lines, and Val Kilmer is 'Mentor' (Elvis).Ably directed by Tony Scott with beautiful cinematography by Jeffrey L. Kimball. A great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer stitches all the segments together. True Romance is one of those films that prove that every once in a while Noir has a pulse. A fun flick with abundant eye candy 9/10",9,4,5,6 April 2015
