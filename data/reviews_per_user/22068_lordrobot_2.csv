Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," horrible
","Couldn't stand it. This is filmmaking at its very worse. Lucas is a very one-dimensional writer/director. It worked for the first couple of films. Not really science fiction, just action with a lot of cool gadgets and a basic good vs.evil plot.This was terrible. I gave up after the first 20 minutes. My intelligence was insulted. I had no interest in the characters, or the story. A trade war? Huh? and the special effects were nauseating. Why hire all those expensive actors? Just animate the humans too.Doesn't matter how lame it is, these star wars fans will go see it anyway and give it 10 stars on the IMDb. If you take away the 10s, this movie would average about a 5. Well, now they can go buy some new star wars dolls to play with",1,28,55,5 January 2001
Memento," Put it in order and it's just an average movie
","Oh, please! I don't understand why this has an 8.5 rating attached to it. It's just an average story which is filmed backwards. There's nothing particularly clever or interesting about the plot besides the timeline. People might look at it and think it's deep just because they're confused",2,3,5,15 July 2001
