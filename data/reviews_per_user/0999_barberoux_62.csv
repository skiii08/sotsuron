The Double Life of Véronique," Empty beauty.
","I tried to like this movie.  I saw it years ago and was not impressed.  I then saw Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy Blue, White, and Red which I thought were wonderful so I thought I'd give Veronique another chance.  Well it wasn't any better the second time.  The movie had no substance.  It seems to be enamored  with Irene Jacob's beauty lingering on shots of her face.  The movie is worthwhile for that, Ms Jacob is indeed a beauty, but it doesn't carry the movie.  There were glimpses of what was to come in his subsequent movies though not enough to fill the movie.  If you like to look at beautiful women's faces this is the movie for you.  I like a bit more from movies, some soul to flesh out the face.",6,14,31,20 August 2001
The Blair Witch Project," Terror is mental.
","I enjoyed this movie.  It is not a slasher blood bath movie with the usual stereotypical scary scenes.  Its terror is mental.  Consider being in the middle of a forest.  It is dark, wet and you are scared.  Where do you run? You can walk all day but still night comes.  You watch the sun go down and know what you will face.  And there is no way out of it.  There is nowhere to go.  A convincing film.  I heard the hype and was not in a positive mindset but I was pulled into the movie and it worked.  I would recommend it.  If you liked 'Scream'  don't bother, rent 'Scream' again.",8,0,1,24 March 2000
Lucky Number Slevin," Not believable.
","I was disappointed by 'Lucky Number Slevin'. I liked the premise of the movie but the execution left a whole lot to be desired. I did not like Josh Hartnett's attitude in the movie. He was not believable as someone who was forced to meet gang bosses because of a case of mistaken identity. He was far too flippant and cocky for the situation and I did not find him in the least appealing. One of the movie's premises was that you had to believe he was an unwitting dupe. He did not advance that belief at all. In fact you suspected him from the beginning and the subsequent events lost their shock value. I had guessed at the underlying story way too early and I just watched it unfold. Nor was the character in the least appealing. Was I supposed to care about this character? Feel some empathy? I felt nothing but disgust for the cold blooded violence he used. The movie was very violent. His affair with Lucy Liu was equally unbelievable. She was lousy in her role. I kept expecting her to be some kind of undercover cop or an assassin since she was so awkward portraying her character. She seemed cold and disingenuous, perfect for someone to turn out to be a baddie but poor as a straight role. Was I to believe that they would be happy ever after at the end? I don't think so and I don't care. Neither actor were appealing to me at all. Bruce Willis played his role with his typical smirking attitude. He was OK. Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci were good given what they had to work with. The script was not that good. It was violent and there were too many coincidences to be believable. Miss it.",5,4,14,17 April 2006
Ali," Wonderful
","I really enjoyed Ali.  I thought it was well paced and it seemed to capture the essence of Ali and his times.  Will Smith was perfect as Ali and the supporting cast was excellent.  Jon Voight as Cosell was fantastic and Jamie Brown was wonderful as Bundini Brown.  I really didn't think he had it in him.  Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee, this movie was filled with convincing, touching performances.  Others have complained about the Zaire running sequence, I found it evocative and meaningful.  It wasn't blatantly presented.  You weren't told what to feel but were presented with a situation and were allowed to extract what you wanted.  (Spoiler possibly looming ahead).  For me it showed Ali realizing that he was more than a popular boxer but was an icon of power over oppression for these people.  His victory was not just for personal glory but would be a positive message to downtrodden people. He had to win for them.  (Spoiler warning defunct.)  This was not a boxing movie but was a movie of a man and a slice of his history.  That said, the boxing sequences were very well staged.  Ali's opponents were well portrayed and the punches looked like they hurt.  Ali was more than a boxer and the movie investigates all of him.  If you expect some kind of Rocky movie you'll be disappointed.  This movie was so much more.",9,0,1,15 January 2002
Skyfall," Weakest of the three
","I thought Skyfall was the weakest of the three Bond films starring Daniel Craig. It was a sentimental mess with none of the hard edge of the previous films. The whole story of disappointment with M was childish. M wasn't being a nice mommy. Where is the professionalism of a double-o agent? SPOILERS ahead. I had three scenes that were a major problem to me. First when Eve was told to 'take the shot' why didn't she fire again? If the hard drive was the most important item then the thing to do would be to shoot Bond and once he was out of the way to shoot Patrice and knock him off the train. Instead the scene was wrapped in this sentimental emotionalism. 'Oh no I shot James Bond!' Weak. The second was the escape of Silva from the glass cage. Okay I can accept some deus ex machina reason for his slipping away, just to keep the story going, but why weren't the underground passages and tube guarded or secured. This facility was supposed to be highly guarded and top secret and all Bond had to do was to lift a grate and voilà a ladder leading to the tube. They had to know the ladder and tunnel were there when they built the place or did the entire British secret service not think about looking under the grates. It was a HUGE security hole. Did they rent the place at the last minute from an ad in the newspaper? It is a wonder some wino living in the subway didn't wander up the ladder and fall asleep in the glass cage. Come on. Why not have Patrice blow a hole in a wall that led to the tube? The third problem was the ending. If Bond knew that people were coming to kill he and M then why not get some help. I assume Britain has an army, or Special Forces, or a police department that could have been utilized. If they were out of communication then how did Patrice find them? Couldn't that dork Q do something to help? Was this action over a weekend and no one was available? How could Silva commander a helicopter and troop of men and the British secret service had nothing. The whole scheme was so amateurish. Silva should have won since he seemed more capable than the whole British government. The whole end fight sequence seemed from a different movie that would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Disappointing. Lots of action and big bangs but a weak script. I thought Javier Bardem was good as the bad guy, given the weak script. Naomie Harris is likable but the love interest part was not believable. Bérénice Marlohe was sufficiently babeish. Ralph Fiennes seems to be a good replacement for Judi Dench and the whole ending in M's office was fun.",7,5,10,18 June 2015
Training Day," Good Performances.
","Training Day was an exciting movie with a great performance by Denzel Washington.  The movie was in fact filled with good performances.  It was nicely photographed and paced well.  The ending was somewhat of a sell out and not too plausible.  Guns, as in most Hollywood productions, were the center piece of the movie.  No wonder we live in violent times.  We worship them in movies such as this.  I rate the movie highly for its fast pace and good acting but discount that rating because of the gun worship and faulty ending.",7,1,11,1 November 2001
Fight Club," Lack of integrity
","I thought a lot about this movie.  I enjoyed it.  Plot twists were done well and the acting was good.  Helena Bonham Carter has succeeded in debasing her smoldering good looks sufficiently enough to become unappealing.  Maybe she believes depth to be gleaned from heroin chic.  Brad Pitt's ego was cleverly used as a plot device.  The premise of the movie of men finding some meaning to life in fighting has some appeal.  Here I sit, screwing off at work, because of the debasement I feel from the layers of management above me. The feeling of being controlled by people I have little respect for and like less for the paycheck so I can pay the mortgage and the credit card bills. I want to punch some faces in but I'm restrained by social mores.  I want to rebel against the suits but need the money.  So I passively resist convention.  I'm contrary.  The men in the movie found their outlet in fighting then by allowing themselves to be debased into obeying automatons. How ironic.  The answer to our self hatred at being social parasites is not debasement.  That seems to be self hatred.  Taking punishment as penance for our weakness.  Maybe the answer lies in having integrity.  That is what the movie lacked.  That is what is so hard to maintain in our society.   That I feel is the answer more than blowing up things because someone told you to. But it doesn't sell tickets.  A movie that sparks introspection is worth watching.  This movie, though it finally sold out, is worth watching.",8,0,1,5 June 2000
Memento," Sinuous
","Memento was an enjoyable movie.  I'm glad I watched it on DVD since the movie's structure is rather unconventional.  Until I became aware of the time lines in the color and back and white sequences, I'll admit I was confused.  I restarted the movie once I knew what was going on.  The movie surprises you and I'm still not sure if I got the story right.  I feel like the main character.  Maybe that was the intent.  Watch it if you like sinuous noir plots.  It is worth it.",8,0,1,18 September 2001
12 Angry Men," Polite
","Free of special effects and with hardly any sets, the movie takes place mostly in one room, '12 Angry Men' grabs and holds your attention throughout.  The acting is first class and the story is compelling.  I was taken by the civility of the group.  The few loud mouths were berated for their poor behavior.  It was refreshing to see especially when compared to the lack of any manners or social conscience of the cast of modern movies. Today's heros are selfish mean-spirited thugs who have no redeeming qualities besides getting the money or the whorey babe at the end of the movie.  The quality called 'an edge' in so many characters in modern movies is a result of the writing of Hollywood hacks who don't know any better.  I believe it reflects the values of the Hollywood culture and it is no wonder independent movies are popular.  See '12 Angry Men'. The movie is well worth seeing.",8,0,0,16 December 2002
Billy Elliot," Formulaic.
",Billy Elliot wasn't a bad movie.  It just followed a formula too closely for my liking.  The formula is: A child from a poor ignorant family gets involved in an activity not usually associated with his socioeconomic class. The family doesn't understand or approve so the activity is done on the sly.  A wise teacher recognizes the child's talent and encourages the activity.  The child has a chance to display his talent to someone of influence but a family crisis threatens to wreck the talented child's chances.  The ignorant parent becomes enlightened at the last moment and they hurriedly show up before the influential person who sees the child's talent and saves the day.  This movie has been made many times before. There were no surprises in this retelling.  I felt some of the scenes were very contrived and didn't make sense given the scenes that preceded them. There was a lack of emotional and character continuity.  Billy liked ballet but he wasn't gay.  That point was blatantly made.  Why?  Why couldn't he be gay?  That would have given the movie a twist.  Maybe the demographics of the prospective paying audience would not like the main character to be gay so he likes ballet but isn't gay.  A gay character was included to show how tolerant and understanding Billy could be but in another scene he is shown to be crude and brutal.  Also the demographics would dictate a rock music background so at a climatic moment the Swan Lake music is introduced but quickly replaced with some mediocre rock song.  It made no sense.  The cursing was also too much.   The movie was rated R because of it.  I would think the target audience would be families and younger people that the R rating would exclude.  If mature audiences were the target group why have such a bland sweet story.  A loss of a big audience just so you can say the eff word.  It makes no sense.,6,0,1,8 May 2001
Insomnia," Not bad
","'Insomnia'  wasn't a bad film.  It isn't as good as the Norwegian original. I believe a close comparison between this movie and the original version is valid since there is only a few years separating them and the story has not been substantially changed.  It is inevitable to compare the two. I felt the original had a less sympathetic but more believable lead.  Al Pacino was good in his role but I think his character was meant to be played as a cop who cut corners to help society. He was really a good guy only trying to improve the overall quality of life.  The original's cop wasn't as kind. Robin Williams was OK as the bad guy. Hillary Swank was good in the role as written.  The original movie role was played as more of a seasoned cop than the neophyte played by Swank.  The discoveries made by this cop seemed more in line with her than with Ms. Swank.  This version was not as hard edged as the original but was more touchy-feely.  I also think the original was filmed a bit quirkier which I enjoy.  (SPOILER lurking ahead).  The shooting of the fellow policeman was handled better in the original.  It seemed to be much more of an accident than in this current movie.  Al Pacino's character would surely be up on charges for negligence where the original's cop was more of a victim of his partner's mistakes, though he couldn't prove it. (SPOILER warning defunct.)  Both movies are worth watching.  I gave the original a slightly better rating.  The Hollywood version was watered down and its edge blunted.",7,0,0,3 December 2002
Spider-Man 3," Not too good.
","This movie was very disappointing. I saw the first two Spiderman movies and I thought they were entertaining. They brought the feeling of the comic to film very well. This episode was very flawed. First it was too, too maudlin. Second, there were too many references back to the original movie. Give it a rest. I don't want to see Uncle Ben die again. Is Cliff Robertson in financial trouble and in need of a job? I'll donate to a Cliff fund just to not see Uncle Ben die again. Third, the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane has to advance beyond the grammar school hand holding. What is the target audience? Twelve year olds? It is so goofy. It is so boring and there's way too much time spent on it. Get over it. The movie bogged down so much without the action sequences. I heard audible sighs from more than one patron and the sighs weren't over the love story. It was exasperation. Even the ending, after the climatic fight scene, was overly long and saccharine. I watched people leave before the end shaking their heads. But on the plus side there were the effects. The Sandman effects were fascinating and the black gooey stuff was good. What happened to the stuff in the lab? That was a bit of a plot hole. The New Goblin fight sequences were exciting and Spiderman's city swinging was fun but again they had to drag Willem Dafoe back into the movie along with the immature Harry Osborn. I'm glad he died since maybe, please, we won't have to go through that story again. The Venom character was good but he was too much. There were too many villains and because of that each one was only superficially developed. The franchise has to move beyond the original story and develop new story lines. It seems difficult for these comic book heroes to move beyond their superficial story lines. Batman is troubled and brooding and you have to watch the moody, pouty scenes. Superman will have some romance with a skinny Lois Lane then some villain will get some kryptonite and trap Superman only for it to be foiled by the villain's moll. Spiderman will appeal to shut-in pre-teens. The plots are predictable and frankly boring. The special effects are the draw and I wish the back stories would just disappear. I enjoyed Hellboy but expect a sequel to repeat lots of the original story. I rate this movie low because too much of it was saccharine hand holding and repetition of the original movie. The action was fun but too interrupted by sentimentality.",5,0,0,15 May 2007
Match Point," Good but miscast
","'Match Point' was Woody Allen's best movie in years. That isn't saying much since I consider his recent attempts to be really bad. The story was similar to 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' where a married man has an affair that threatens his marriage. Performances by most of the major characters were very good. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton were especially good in their roles. I also liked Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was at times a bit over doing it but still his performance was believable. Unfortunately the only one I was disappointed with was Scarlett Johansson. I like her as an actress and I've enjoyed her in her other roles but I think she was miscast as the sexy femme fatale. She is gorgeous but she seems too intelligent to fit into the role as a troubled would-be actress. I think a more bimboish actress would have fit the role better. It isn't that she was bad just awkward in the role. Still the movie is worth seeing. Now for the problems of the movie. Mr. Allen typically portrays members of the upper middle class. His characters move through the rarefied sets like people from 1930's movies. They are impeccably dressed and often are portrayed having drinks. 'Match Point' was no different but this time it was set in London instead of New York and the switch maybe helped since the characters were more familiar, at least if you watch Masterpiece Theater. I don't particularly like his characters. I find them to be spoiled and complaintive. There is no portrayal of people on the street. You know the street. The place between fashionable enclaves and expensive apartments, between trendy galleries and smart restaurants. The characters move through a world untouched by most of the moviegoers and suffer problems caused by their own selfishness. How are we, the movie watchers, supposed to feel any empathy with characters who are so removed from our lives. His movies aren't escapist fare where muscled jocks and hot babes raced around in expensive cars avoiding the law while pulling their latest caper. Mr. Allen's movie explore the humanness of life but lately they feel very removed from real life. I have a real problem caring what happens to the characters. They don't appeal nor resonate with me. Maybe Mr. Allen is portraying the group he is most familiar with. I think he needs to get out more.",7,0,1,31 January 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Gory, glossy and goofy.
","This film had so much promise.  It had a wonderful cast and good director but it seems the story was not enough to sustain a movie of this length. The story meandered from character to character looking for a focus.  It was moodily photographed and had some great effects, head lopping never looked so real. It looked really nice but lacked substance.  Dreams sequences of Crane's Victoria Secret clad mother had to be added as filler.  They had nothing to do with the story.  Most of the female leads seemed dressed in wonder bras.  Unfortunately missing was the legendary Ricci cleavage.",6,0,0,19 June 2000
Ocean's Twelve," An embarrassment
","'Ocean's 12' was a horrible movie. It was what I consider a typical big budget Hollywood disaster. The story was lame, the acting was poor and what the hell is the appeal of Julia Roberts. Her lips are swollen and misshapen from collagen injections and her hair is thinning and limp looking. She looks tired and worn out not the beauty she is supposed to be in the movie. The trick of her playing herself was a ridiculous, self serving plot twist that was there only for the celebrity name dropping crowd. Bruce Willis should be embarrassed with his role in this crap. Catherine Zeta-Jones was pleasing to look at but her role and acting were on par with an after-school special. The plot was convoluted and supposedly full of twists. Here's a secret, plot twists must make sense. You can't just tell a totally different story after building up the heist so much. Why not have one of the, wasted, peripheral characters, (everyone was wasted and peripheral except for the big 3 names), invent an invisibility potion, drink it and just waltz in and steal the item. It would have made as much sense. The story told by the Night Fox and his laser dance was laughably lame. It ranks up there as one of the most ridiculous scenes I have seen lately. The camera work was amateurish and repetitive and the screenplay was written by a committee of no talent children. It was an awful, awful movie and should be an embarrassment to all involved. Please, please miss it.",2,1,2,2 May 2005
Knocked Up," Distasteful
","'Knocked up' had some funny moments and I laughed occasionally but I left the movie feeling very disenchanted. This is another California movie. It is all about this materialistic, drug ridden, shallow, selfish, youth obsessed, crude, rude and distasteful California lifestyle. I would not want to meet any of the people portrayed in this movie in real life. In fact I have to deal with this type in real life, the self-obsessed, cell phone gabbing, SUV driving bores. I think we are bombarded with this stereotype so often in the media that we start to believe that that is the way to be. I found the so-called adults in this movie to be immature and obsessed with instant gratification. If they didn't get what they want immediately then they had grounds to act crude and childish. Leslie Mann's character was distasteful. She was a foul mouthed child. Her husband, played by Paul Rudd, griped about not being able to do what he wanted so he was forced to lie to get some free time. Of course his free time meant dumping his kids on his wife. They lived in a sumptuous house and he drove a Mercedes sports car. Of course because of a spat he had to take off to Las Vegas with Ben to cavort with strippers and indulge in psychedelic mushrooms. Did they have any appreciation for their lifestyle? No. I saw them being angry at not being instantly gratified and entertained. Really how many of the audience would have the time or money to indulge in this behavior. My neighbor works two jobs and struggles to send his children to State Colleges. I don't see him portrayed in California movies. Katherine Heigl played her role well but her character's success was based not on talent or hard work but on her good looks. How Californian. Seth Rogen's character was crude, crude, crude. He played it well. I could almost smell his character's acrid body odor. This movie will be a hit with the lucrative 18 to 25 crowd. That is a scary thought that this portrayal of boorish, self-involvement would resonate with a group of people. I noted that more drug related killings happened in Philadelphia recently. Drugs and the violence they breed are a problem because there is a ready market for the product and lots of money can be made from it. This movie glorified drug use. Is there no social consciousness? Do we rate social consciousness by how much the box office pulls in this weekend? I wasn't alone in my dislike. People got up and walked out on this movie. I go to see movies often and it is rare to see people disgusted enough to walk out. This was a morally objectionable movie.",3,12,58,8 June 2007
Nacho Libre," Not Funny
","The major problem with 'Nacho Libre' is that it isn't funny. It tries very hard but the jokes are excruciatingly slowly set up and painfully executed. Given the elaborate set ups the payoff is small change. I grinned a few times during the movie but looked at my watch twice as often. It was not very good. Jack Black and Ana de la Reguera were good in the movie and the script had lots of raw material to work with but the execution was really bad. Just having a funny looking character does not make the character funny. Too often a character is introduced and they do nothing but stand there, trying to look funny. Don't waste your time seeing this mess. It just isn't funny.",4,5,10,28 June 2006
Capote," Great
",'Capote' was very good. I really enjoyed the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman. He nailed Truman Capote's speech and fawning manner. I recently read 'In Cold Blood' and I was very entertained by the movie's portrayal of the events from the book. There were many fine performances. Catherine Keener was great as Harper Lee and Clifton Collins as Perry Smith. Actually Clifton Collins' portrayal was a bit too sympathetic for me. Perry Smith was a brutal killer with real psychological problems and the movie's portrayal only hinted at that. The movie was wonderfully photographed and the screenplay was intelligently written. Well worth seeing.,9,0,0,5 May 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Better than 12 but not by much
","Ocean's Thirteen was better than Ocean's 12. That isn't saying much since O12 was horrible. O13 was a tad better. Al Pacino helped by creating a character who was believable and entertaining. Ellen Barkin was terribly miscast. Her role would have been played better by some riper, younger actress. Brad Pitt look very please with himself and George Clooney avoided being too smug. Neither were all that entertaining and the movie focused on them most of the time. I thought the movie was slow. The caper consisted of solving a series of problems in rigging all of the gambling at Al Pacino's casino. The rigging was accomplished with a bunch of unexplained, magical devices. It felt more like Wily E. Coyote's Acme products than actual plausible products. The mine digging machine was ridiculous. It was way too fantastical to be believed. The rigging of the diamond prize was clever and believable. The trouble with sequels is that the characters are not developed further but are just referred to in a kind of role shorthand. The whole screenplay was a shorthand version of a caper movie. The Ocean story is that these really clever guys have to rob an entire casino against great odds which they accomplish with neato devices and tricks. This movie followed the outline but failed to develop the robbery techniques beyond magical Acme devices. How did pouring powder in the dice raw material actually make the dice roll over by pressing another magic device? It wasn't engineering it was magic. The movie required one to suspend too much belief in reality to make the caper work. A drilling machine in the middle of a major city, that breaks and has to be replaced in a day, and bores a huge tunnel under the city with no one noticing. Come on! It would take months for a team of engineers to accomplish the task of just getting the machine started. The caper just didn't work. The ensemble casting wasn't an ensemble. It was three stars with other people around. The acting wasn't terrible but just egocentric. Wait for a dark and stormy night and rent it.",5,41,78,16 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great Effects
","The special effects were wonderful in this movie.   The story was easier to follow than the first episode and the new aliens and diverse worlds were great to experience.   The love story bits were something else.  If Annette Funicello had a cameo during the sappy love story bits I wouldn't have been surprised.   Hayden Christensen was a petulant, immature, ill-mannered little boy.  He had no appeal or believability as a Jedi.  I can't see how he would have lasted through any kind of rigorous training.  Natalie Portman was more appealing and though she was believable as a Queen she seemed too young to be a senator.  She was good in the movie, attractive and appealing. Hayden Christensen seemed much more appealing in the DVD extra features than he did in the movie.  Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid were all good.  Dialog was typically clunky.  Someone should slowly ease George Lucas away from the typewriter after the general outline of the movie is finished and allow someone with some experience with real people and dialog polish the final version.  The movies succeed in spite of the characterizations not because of them.  It is the effects and the action that appeal.  The fight sequences are so full of detail that subsequent watching is just as enjoyable.  There is always FFWD for the love story.",9,0,1,2 December 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," Stiles Shines.
","The film editors had to have been on Dramamine. I disliked the shaky camera and the half obscured views. I can understand a partially blocked view if there is a point to it. Like to represent some surreptitious filming but to have the camera view blocked by intervening objects, thus bring to the forefront that the character is being filmed, i.e. that they are actually actors doing a job, seems counterproductive. I would think the goal is to get the audience to forget that they are watching a crafted production and have them suspend disbelief and get involved in the story. The stylized camera work did the opposite. I was constantly reminded that the camera was purposely obscured with blurry objects for no reason but style, like look at this I'm blocking half the shot. Aren't I cleaver? I found it very irritating. This was the weakest of the three Bourne films with the action sequences shot in a way that obscured what was actually happening. I don't like the jittering hand-held camera and extreme close-ups. I think it detracts from the movie. Maybe it makes the cinematography easier since shots don't have to be composed, just move that camera in and most of the filming could be done in a broom closet. 'The DaVinci Code' sucked for the some reason. Also the 21st century deus ex machina of computers was abundantly evident. A couple of keystrokes can replace intelligent writing easily plus the computers can be fickle and reveal all if needed while being conspicuously absent when suspense is needed. Matt Damon was good in his role, looking serious and troubled, and he was effective in the fight sequences, as far as I could tell. Joan Allen was very good as an intelligent mature woman, rare to see in the bimbo age of movies. David Strathairn, who I typically like, was too much of a cliché for my tastes. A standout was Julie Stiles. She had this tight lipped intelligent look. You could just see the wheels turning as she analyzed each situation I believed she was an intelligence operative who was trained to keep secrets and revealing very little of what she was feeling. She was great. Albert Finney did a competent job in another clichéd role. It seems that in these movies the idealistic, good people are young and the bastardly, manipulators are all old fogies. I would rate this movie as a weak 7 out of 10 on the basis of the strong performance of Ms. Stiles and Mr. Damon and on the basis of a continued compelling story. The camera work downgraded my rating.",7,2,4,13 August 2007
The Bourne Identity," Good Action Movie.
","`The Bourne Identity'  was a good action movie.  It had some exciting action scenes and car chases and, if not examined too much, a decent story.  The story was somewhat conventional spy fare with double crosses and hidden agendas and was done in a style that didn't require a total suspension of belief in the laws of physics.  Matt Damon was good and Franka Potente played a unconventional but intriguing female lead.  Brian Cox and Clive Owen played their roles convincingly.  Julie Stiles was good looking.  There wasn't much else for her to do.  The European setting was attractive and the scenes with the Mini were fun.  For mindless fun it is worthy of a watch.",7,1,2,12 May 2003
The Italian Job," Fun
","`The Italian Job'  was entertaining.  The two capers were inventive and exciting and the product placement car scenes were fun.  The acting was okay.  There wasn't a whole lot you could do with the trite dialogue.  It was an action movie.  When there wasn't action on the screen the movie lagged.  Charlize Theron was sufficiently babish to sustain interest in non-action scenes.   The characters were a clichéd lot of  movie types.  The computer hacker stereotype allows for awkward plot developments to be remedied with five key strokes.    Overall the movie did its job of providing good summer entertainment.  The pace was, mostly, fast and the characters were appealing.  Worth a watch.",7,0,3,5 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Special effects epic.
","'Lord of the rings' was as good as has been said.  It is not a perfect movie though.  I found the effects to be very well done but somewhat distracting. There seems to be this way of having a camera sweep over the effect so you get an idea of the scene but never really focus or linger on any particular object.   I enjoyed the lingering shots inside of Bilbo's cottage and the effect of making Gandalf seem so much larger than the Hobbits around him. That was well done.  Ian Holm looked tiny compared to Gandalf.  The other monster type effects were too fleeting for me.  Quick cuts of moving figures looked just confusing for my slow eyes.  I enjoyed the shot of Arwen's horse galloping at full speed far more than dark, jumpy shots of Orcs, Goblins, and Uruks.  Nonetheless the movie was successful in portraying a believable, fictious world.  The crossing the bridge in the Mines of Moria was impressive also a lingered shot of Gollum was good. The movie is long, lots of fidgiting after 2 hours, and violent but not particularly gory.  I would recommend it.",8,0,0,5 February 2002
The Village," Misjudged
","I think 'The Village' is getting misjudged. It is unfortunate that the advertising presents this movie as a monster/slasher type thing. It is not.I thought it was a rather touching story after you got away from the monster in the woods bit. Sorry I can't say much more due to the nature of the story. Please don't read about the movie before going to see it. Foreknowledge will ruin the experience. And please don't expect some Halloweenish slasher crap because you'll be very disappointed. I thought the performances by William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Joaquin Phoenix to be very good. Stilted but I think that was the nature of the Village demeanor.Bryce Dallas Howard was very good as Ivy. M. Night Shyamalan's movies are very moody and atmospheric and this one is no exception.",8,0,0,6 August 2004
Pitch Black," Good action, implausible, but fun.
","I enjoyed this fast moving nicely photographed movie.  It had good effects, some gruesome scary monsters and lots of action. It's not for those who must analyze the plausibility or logic of the planet and inhabitants but if you are able to put logic aside the movie is fun.  Cast was effective; effects were good.  Worth seeing.",7,0,0,18 October 2000
"I, Robot"," Derivative and Contrived
","'I, Robot' was OK. The effects were good enough to keep me entertained. The robot story was OK but the interpersonal relationships were banal. Bridget Moynahan as the female lead was forgettable. Her acting consisted of pouty looks and I wanted to lend her my comb and compliment her gums. Will Smith was good given the script he had to work with. I thought there were too many beefcake shots then were necessary for the story and not enough cheesecake. There were two obligatory shower scenes. A must for future set action movies. Are we to take from this that at least hot water will exist and people will be clean in the future. The movie had big problems. The effects were cartoonish. The robot's movements did not look real but looked more like cartoon mice escaping from a cartoon cat. In Spiderman this worked since Spiderman is essentially a comic and the CGI effects helped to bring out the cartoonish aspects of a comic figure and integrate him into reality. The robots also looked cartoonish but since they had no comic heritage there wasn't a tie to them and they just looked out of place. The human characters did little than fire guns haphazardly in crowds of people. The robot design was derived from Attack of the Clones. Little was innovative. Will Smith's costume of leather jacket and Converse sneakers was laughable. He was an anachronism. I understand his costume evoked modern urban dress but the movie was set in the future and his dress would be analogous to a character wearing a Zoot suit in movie set in the present day. The rest of the costumes were typically Matrix, (or when did it start, with Blade Runner?), derivatives, long leather coats or dark somber tones. Why does Hollywood insist on dressing future people in funereal dress? All bad guys have to wear black and leather. Many action movies could very well be black and white movies. Where is the color? In the news recently were pictures of the murderous death squads in Liberia who wore women's wigs and bathrobes as they sadistically killed at random. They were scary. The black leather clad, and also stubbled, bad guys in movies are a cliché. Where is the innovation? Where are costume designers? I see the same old Borg stuff over and over. What a bore!SPOILER ALERT How did Will Smith hurt his arm? They lingered over the beefcake scene of Susan touching the arm but I did not catch how the injury occurred. Spoiler warning defunct.The ending seemed too Deus ex machinish, actually machina. It didn't make all too much sense and seemed contrived and rushed. The Matrix gun play was also derivative and contrived. The whole movie was contrived and derivative just mindless cartoonish effects. The 'Three Laws of Robotics' were integral to the story but were never attributed to Isaac Asimov. That was a shame.",5,0,0,23 July 2004
American Beauty," Adolescent.
","This was a good movie, not as good as the hype but worthy.  I thought the theme was rather adolescent though.  It was like a good teenager movie where youth is wise and knowing, in touch with their feelings and adults are louts obsessed with money.  Kevin Spacey played a character who, supposedly, found himself and shucked off all the social crap holding him down.  I guess I saw that whole theme as the rather adolescent.  He could work at a minimum wage job and not have any worries about money and drive his cool fast Firebird. Who doesn't want to return to the carefree days of being a teenager where clean clothes appeared in your drawers and meals were placed before you in a spotless tastefully decorated single home where you hung out in your room and got high listening to music.  I've worked at minimum wage jobs and lived in the hovels you could afford on that salary.  It is not as portrayed in this movie. I saw this movie at a local mega-plex and listened to the crowd afterwards comment on how deep and heavy the movie was as they got into their SUVs and drove to the mall to kill some time shopping. I can understand why this movie won awards since it mirrors the wishes of our pathetic, youth obsessed society.",7,0,0,27 June 2000
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good but Swedish version is better.
","I enjoyed this version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'. It was a well made and well acted movie and I gave it a 7/10 rating. But I enjoyed the Swedish version more, 8/10. The Swedish version was truer to the book and a bit more coherent. The acting in both movies was fine, some great performances in both and I can't really fault either movie. I thought the American version could have been a bit confusing since they took such liberties with the book's narrative. The main character of Mikael Blomkvist in the American version was a bit less conspicuous which is a good thing since I got rather sick of Mikael Blomkvist by the end of the third book. He wasn't a believable character since he was so self-righteous and such a ladies man. His portrayal by Michael Nyqvist in the Swedish version was also underplayed, and well acted. The really big difference between the versions was the portrayal of Lisbeth Salander. She was the biggest draw of the books and the movies and her character drove the narrative for me. Noomi Rapace portrayed her in the Swedish version and was wonderful in the role. She was Lisbeth Salander to me. Rooney Mara in the American version was good but not in the same league with Noomi Rapace. In the American film she came across as a more deliberately rude, petulant little girl, like a spoiled ,rich, high schooler who did what she did to get attention and anger people. Noomi Rapace's version came across as a more disturbed person, someone who just didn't have social skills or even thought about them. In the books she was more of a idiot savant or someone who could have Asperger syndrome. She was horrible mistreated as a youth but was extremely intelligent and talented. Noomi Rapace had that down. Her most interesting scenes were as Lisbeth sitting and thinking. You could see the wheels turning. You could see her figure things out. Rooney Mara didn't have that. She just was shock value. Not that she was bad in the role but just not deep enough. She bragged more and was more out there with her personality. Noomi Rapace was very internal and disliked anyone getting close to her. She had few friends and even with them she was very reserved. It was a wonderfully intriguing portrayal. Both movies are good but if you are a fan of the books you may like the Swedish version more with Noomi Rapace's portrayal of Lisbeth Salander.",7,4,9,9 January 2012
Spider-Man," Good Effects
","'Spiderman' was an enjoyable movie overall.  I wasn't all that familiar with the character before seeing the movie but I think it did a good job at telling the story and introducing the character.  Tobey Maguire was good as the lead but Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst were somewhat wasted in their roles.  Some of the effects seemed cartoonish and some of the violent scenes weren't cartoonish enough.  The fight sequences, especially the punches to Spiderman's face, seemed too personal or intimate given the tone of the movie.  There were these cold CGI sequences followed by a bloody punch to the mouth of Spiderman in slow motion.  Was that really necessary?  I think it ruined the tone of the movie.  The Green Goblin was goofy.  It did not seem real at all and that ridiculous mask hid the actor.  Was that the point?  Why have a famous name as the villain if he is hid by the costume. Save the expense by hiring an unknown and hiding him in a fancy costume. Kirsten Dunst was wasted except for the wet dress scene.  Overall the cartoon tone and effects were enjoyable as escapist fare.",7,0,0,4 December 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Banal and Ridiculous.
","This was a bad movie.  Maybe 15 year olds could get some enjoyment from the cool cars but for anyone else the story was ridiculous.  Didn't a floor plate fall out of the undercover cop's car during a race?  This was the same car that Vin Deisel jumped into minutes later.  Were we to assume some kind of Flintstone locomotion was in effect.  Did anyone notice that the lead good cop was a blonde white guy and all the baddies were either Hispanics or Asians?  Did anyone notice the bullet spraying, speeding and being chased by cops never lead to an arrest?  Did anyone notice the overall tone of lawlessness was celebrated?  What an uplifting, socially aware movie this was.  The special effects were of 'Dukes of Hazard' vintage.  Vin Deisel was passable in his role. Paul Walker was forgettable.  Michelle Rodriguez, who was so good in 'Girlfight', played a cliched sex-object role.",3,0,1,8 January 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Caper Movie.
","Basically this was a caper movie.  A bunch of professionals go against overwhelming odds to rob a impregnable target.  It wasn't bad.  The movie managed to keep me entertained throughout.  I found the 2 lead's, Clooney and Pitt, egos distasteful and the lead female role was terribly miscast. Julia Roberts was skinny and sullen and not at all the beautiful object of desire as referred to in the movie.  I found myself repeating 'Hey Collegen Man' whenever she appeared on screen.  Don't you think something is wrong when you have to be told through the script that the person coming on screen is supposed to be beautiful.  Shouldn't the appearance of the actress say it.  Some of the female extras were much better looking.  Many of the supporting cast were fun to watch and the plot twists were, though expected, entertaining.  The central love story was not believable, needed nor successful.  Rent it, don't waste money on a theater.",6,0,1,9 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Horrible
","This was a horrible movie.  Once you got to the actual attack the special effects were impressive and entertaining but getting to that event was excruciating.  The sappy love story seemed written by pre-teens, Barbie goes to war.  The characters were one dimensional cut outs and every war movie cliche had to be included.  Events were staged for effect.  For example, in one scene in a factory the floors were wetted down to get that nice sheen for the camera.  Why would factory floors be flooded on purpose.  It made no sense besides getting a nice shot.  History was condensed and twisted to fit into quick sketches.  Anyone watching this film to gather some sense as to why this attack happened would be very disappointed.  The Japanese were portrayed as just the sneaky villains.  It is a wonder they didn't have mustaches to twirl.  The dialogue was stilted, the subtitles were barely legible, the music was maudlin, it was a bad, bad movie.  Don't waste your money.",3,4,6,17 December 2001
Man on the Moon," Rather ordinary
","This was a rather ordinary commonplace biography about a very uncommon person.  Jim Carrey was good as Andy Kaufman.  Just good, not great.  When doing Kaufman's great acts Carrey was seen as acting the parts; Andy Kaufman became the parts.  When you saw Andy imitate Elvis you were struck by the transformation from the nervous geek to the swaggering super confident king. Jim Carrey made it seem to be another imitation.  Maybe I was spoiled by seeing the original.  Courtney Love was surprisingly effective.  Tony Clifton was absolutely fabulous.",7,0,0,13 June 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Nicely Filmed.
",This was a beautifully photographed film.  Many scenes are haunting and stay with you afterwards.  I found the story rather romantically juvenile not unlike other Chinese martial arts films.  The fight scenes were nicely choreographed and had a supernatural quality to them.  I felt the flying was a bit much.  The need to have heroes fly must be in some collective subconscious.  In the west we have Superman; in the East they have martial arts masters.  I enjoyed the movie despite the almost silly story.  Martial art movies do have some fun bad guys.  Jade Fox was a memorable villain.,7,0,0,11 June 2001
X-Men: The Last Stand," Good effects; confusing story.
","'X-Men: The Last Stand' was OK for a summer action movie. The special effects were good and the story moved quick enough to keep me entertained. The story consists of the mutant X-men against the government, who want to 'cure' mutants. If you are familiar with the stories this episode is just more of the same. That leads to one of the criticisms I have about the movie. Too many of the characters, and events, have a back story from the comics and in order to really appreciate the fullness of the plot the audience must be somewhat intimate with the Marvel comic culture. Many events and characters are presented in a kind of abbreviated fashion, like short hand. I never read Marvel comics and so much of the movie was not quite confusing but hazy, like who was Kelsey Grammar supposed to be, someone with testosterone poisoning and a heart condition? I figure he was a mutant due to the blue skin and hairiness but since I wasn't privy to the back story the character was just another oddity. I'm sure I could find lots of information on his character on the web but I think a movie must stand alone and not require research before seeing. The acting was OK given the preposterousness of the plot. I found the interpersonal scenes a bit maudlin. Of course the scene with Ian McKellen at the chess board hints at more sequels making the 'Last Stand' part of the title a bit of a joke. Overall the movie was fun with good special effects and if you don't take it too seriously, nor care for character development, it is worth seeing.",7,0,1,6 June 2006
Hellboy," Fun
","I thought `Hellboy' was a fun movie.  It isn't deep or understated but it is loud, special-effects laden escapist fare.  The cast was effective.  The bad guys were real bad and the good guys were there to battle the bad guys. The movie included Nazis, demons from Hell and an evil Blonde Nazi in love with a reincarnated Rasputin.  What more could you ask for.  Hellboy himself was played very well by Ron Perlman who gave him a vulnerability and cockiness that you wish to see in a lead monster.  The story was fast paced and slightly ridiculous but it held your attention and entertained.  It is well worth seeing  if you wish to entertained and not challenged.   The movie does not take itself too seriously but is more of a live action (or live through CGI) cartoon.  Too many action movies, like the Matrix stuff, take themselves far too seriously.  With this movie you want to relax  and laugh at the preposterousness of the plot .  I left the theater grinning and glad I saw the movie.  Isn't that what you want.",8,0,0,9 April 2004
Hero," A Cartoon
","'Hero' was visually stunning. The colors and cinematography were excellent but I have a bit of a problem with the story. It was the same basic story of all martial arts movies. I'm going to kill you because you killed somebody and I have to avenge the killing so I have to fight you. Though each segment of the movie was in a different color the plot within each segment was basically the same, two people fighting. The segment continued until the stoic fighter beat the other fighter. I found it somewhat boring.The story was simplistic and the fighting, though maybe highly skilled, repetitious. The wire fighting scenes were ridiculous. I find them to be more Stan Lee than Bruce Lee. I think comparisons to Kurosawa misleading since Kurosawa had much deeper stories and characters. This movie is a cartoon. It is a nice visual treat and in that sense it is worth seeing.",6,0,1,10 September 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Good if you like this kind of thing.
","I must admit that this is not my kind of movie.   It seemed to be inventive and fast moving and had lots of nice songs but I guess I was wanting a little more story and less extravaganza.  Jim Broadbent, Ewan McGregor and John Leguizamo were very good.  I must admit another bias, I cannot stand Nicole Kidman.  I think her acting is egocentric hamming.  I think she was miscast and the movie suffered because of her.  Other problems were too quick MTVish shots and the penchant of the cast to yell their lines.  It was a bold movie clearly taking a chance with an odd way of telling the story and was, my biases aside, successful.",6,0,1,11 February 2002
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Childish
","'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' was a childish movie. It was obviously meant for a teenage crowd. I found it ridiculously saccharine. The whole story about the wedding and the delays and Reed Richards' divided attention was just so adolescent. I know the movie is supposed to be comic book but couldn't the producers create something that appealed to people over 15 years old. The effects were technically impressive but pretty devoid of any real suspense. The characters were just clichés and the acting was just good enough for you to know that. Jessica Alba can't really act. She is really hot looking but utterly unconvincing and rather boring. I can't really say that this film is worth seeing. Maybe it is good enough for a rent, maybe.",6,2,5,28 June 2007
The Dark Knight," Good summer movie. No masterpiece.
","It is a good movie. It is not a great movie. After all of the hype I was a bit disappointed. I enjoyed the movie but thought it was just a run of the mill superhero action flick. The performances were good. All of the actors were believable and Heath Ledger's Joker was a great character but it was a one note performance. There was no real depth to the character for me. Each time he appeared he acted in the same psychotic manner but there wasn't an exploration as to why he was doing what he was doing or where he planned to take the story. The story was just a simplistic hatred of Batman and a want to unmask him. Sorry, same old, same old. Superhero movies suffer from clichéd story lines. Superman in each movie will be exposed to kryptonite. Profess his unfulfilled love for Lois Lane, (why I don't know. She is usually portrayed as some skinny, ambitious harpy), and is eventually saved from the bad guy by some babe. Spiderman yearns with unfulfilled love for his girlfriend and fights off some bad guy while reminiscing again about his Uncle, who we get to see die again. Batman will struggle with his demons while fighting off another bad guy punctuated by corrupt cops and double crosses. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a fine actress and is attractive but she is not an outstanding beauty who would attract the Joker to her in lieu of all of the other babes in the room. It is not helpful when the script has to tell you that the character is beautiful. The character's looks should tell you she is beautiful. Monique Curnen was there to provide the corrupt cop. One of many. She was wasted. Give me something new and fresh. Not a new gadget but a new story line. Explore more than the obvious. This movie was a series of vignettes of action scenes and simplistic twists. There were way too many deus ex machina moments and the twists did nothing but provide excuses for more action scenes. SPOILER ALERT. The scene with the cop being goaded by the joker to beat him up was clumsily telegraphed. Gordan appearing again at the exact opportune moment rang false. Aaron Eckhart's accident and metamorphosis into Two-face was rushed and hardly used. It became more of a distraction from the main story of the Joker. The Joker's character could have been examined in more depth. As it was the ending felt like it was there only to provide grist for the sequel. Heath Ledger's unfortunate death, which added hype to the movie, also destroyed the ending of the movie. There was no closure. It seems more like coming attractions for the next movie. Don't get me wrong it was a fun movie but it is just a summer popcorn movie and not a wondrous masterpiece it is being touted as. See it, enjoy it and then forget it until the next installment.",7,8,16,5 August 2008
"Girl, Interrupted"," No surprises.
",Rather typical crazy girl movie.  Scenes are set up and play out just as expected. Plot line draws from column A then column B of movie cliches. Winona Rider good in a weakly written role.  Angelina Jolia was competent in the bad girl show-stealing role.  Nothing in this movie got beyond the ordinary.  Could have been much better.,6,0,0,20 July 2000
Chariots of Fire," Touching
","I enjoyed 'Chariots of Fire'.  I thought the running scenes were exciting, the acting was good and the story uplifting.  I saw this movie when it first came out and I liked it.  I recently saw it on DVD and my initial impression was upheld.  I did think it was somewhat choppily edited though.  The cuts from scene to scene were abrupt and often I felt that I had entered the scene a few lines of dialog too late.  It is worth seeing nonetheless.",8,0,4,23 March 2003
Grindhouse," Too referential; too long
","First, it was too long. My bladder was too insistent and I had to leave in the middle. I hate that. I usually adjust my liquid intake to avoid any interruption. Three hours plus, without an intermission, is too long. I'm sure the length of the movie turned people off. Second, the plot of the 'Planet Terror' sequence was nonsensical. I know it was meant to emulate the plots of the type of movie that was shown in the grindhouses in the 1970's but they were lousy movies to begin with. I got the reference five minutes after it started then I was pretty bored for the rest of the movie. It was not a very good movie. A homage not only references the parent material but it has to be entertaining for itself. 'Planet Terror' was not entertaining enough for me. If I had watched that movie at home I would probably had been reading at the same time. There's not enough there to keep your interest. OK another zombie gets blown away, big deal. There was lots of action and hot babes but not much else. 'Death Proof' was a much better movie. The references were there but the movie stood up by itself. There was the obligatory missing reel, an over told joke, that really didn't detract from the story much, and the Tarantino touches like the extended dialogs and the cursing. I found the dialogs, with the cursing, to be a bit over the top. I thought the information imparted by the dialog meant little to the plot and that the dialog was just a stylistic flourish, too much of a flourish. The beginning of the story was a bit slow. Luckily there were enough hot babes to sustain one's interest until the action started. The action was great. Zoe Bell was okay as an actress but as an action star she was great. The car chase scenes were nicely done. It just seems so satisfying to see vintage muscle cars in a car chase being wrecked. The acting was decent and there were a multitude of good performances. Rose McGowan looked better in 'Planet Terror', maybe it was the stump. Overall 'Grindhouse' was an OK movie. 'Planet Terror' could be improved by missing a couple more reels. Its plot is just repetition anyway. 'Death Proof' was a much better sequence. I think it needed more plot and less characters. I have to get involved with the characters and care what happens to them. With multiple characters I cared more for the Dodge Challenger than the drivers. Kurt Russell was despicable enough to want to see him get his comeuppance but the women, the many women, were too interchangeable to care about. Maybe it was meant to be referential but I thought the women characters, at least the first bunch of women in 'Death Proof', were nothing more than sexual poster girls to sustain your interest until something else happened. The turn around in the second half of 'Death Proof' was refreshing. I enjoy strong women characters in movies, like Pam Grier in Tarantino's 'Jackie Brown'. Too bad Hollywood just churns out hot babe movies. I guess the supply of young women willing to be exploited is endless.",7,3,5,19 April 2007
The Hurricane," Denzel is good; movie OK.
",This movie was pretty much what I expected. A man wrongly accused of a crime is usually portrayed as noble and strong in the face of all the injustice in the world and the bad guys are oozing bile. The movie followed the formula fairly closely.  If it wasn't for the strong convincing performance of Denzel Washington the movie would have been nothing.  Don't you wish that Hollywood could make a movie of this type and show the hero as very flawed but still innocent.  I never watch this type of movie and think I am seeing the truth.  It is an entertainment not a commentary.  This movie with its stereotypes and polar views of good and evil is probably a good example of its type.  It is well acted and nicely photographed.  It breaks no new ground.,7,0,2,20 September 2000
Invincible," Good Genre Movie
","'Invincible' is a genre movie. It is a sports hero movie and of the type it was good. The genre calls for lots of male bonding touching, big handshakes, back thumps, hugs with back thumps, hugs sans thumps, etc. It also calls for a certain maudlin feeling in the absence of thumps and sports and this was in abundance in the life is hard dialog. A love interest is also needed and was provided by Elizabeth Banks whose tonsils were examined by Mark Wahlberg with their first kiss. I thought the photography outside of the football shots was pretty bad. I thought it was dark, blurry and grainy maybe trying to look depressing when contrasted with the footballs scenes. In short the movie provided just what you expect from the genre. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie but I just wasn't impressed by the stereotypical set ups. The football scenes make the movie. Once they are start concentrating on the Eagles and Greg Kinnear as Dick Vermeil the movie was much better. I am not an especially rabid football fan but the Eagle's scenes were exciting. They were well photographed and choreographed and were exciting and affecting. Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear were very good in their roles and the rest of the cast were good given the dialog they were given. The basic story of a bartender given a chance to play professional football, especially since it was true, was uplifting and this movie portrayed the excitement and hope that this event gave to the city. If you're a football fan the movie is a must see. Others may find the maudlin tone of the non-football scenes too much. I liked the movie and recommend it.",7,1,3,20 October 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," Worth discussing.
","I've just watched Eyes Wide Shut for the third time.  I think the movie has great depth and can invoke good discussions of its meaning.  The performances of the actors are generally good except for the two principles. I found Cruise wooden and Kidman overemoting but both were passable.  It's just that they were surrounded by a talented cast.  What was the movie about?  (SPOILERS lurk ahead).  I think the movie is a metaphor of marriage. Cruise's sexual ego becomes damaged after Kidman confesses to sexual fantasies, about another man.  He encounters sexual situations that further shake his already damaged psyche.  He then discovers his alter ego,what he might want to be if freed from his conventions, in the form of Nightengale and obtains the password to a place that promises forbidden pleasures.  The apparent orgy he then attends is, in fact, the metaphor for marriage.  The women are anointed, or blessed, by the high priest, then they reveal their sexuality.  They choose a man and go off to enjoy all kinds of sexual pleasure.  Cruise the intruder is unmasked and told to leave and not to mention what goes on within the mansion.  The sexual pleasure is only to be enjoyed within the mansion, or within the confines of marriage.  Outside of the mansion, or marriage, sexual pleasure brings about dire circumstances. A hooker dies of a overdose and Cruise visits another, (naively bearing pastries for the prostitute), and is warned off by the possibility of death from disease, the HIV.  He is further warned to stop his enquires, into infidelity, when he shows up at the mansion again. (How does he get into the mansion? By, falsely, promising fidelity.)  He goes home and finds the mask on his pillow.  Was this an invitation to enjoy sex within the bounds of marriage with his wife?  I've wondered about the ending sequence, and the last word, and its meaning and I think it shows sexual freedom is allowed within the marriage.  Maybe my interpretation is a stretch but the movie allows for that stretch and that is why is so good.",8,0,1,8 August 2001
The Descent," Good Scary Movie
","When I read that 'The Descent' featured an all women cast I expected a T+A extravaganza with spelunkers in too tight T-shirts and panties cavorting beneath the earth. I was disappointed. What I saw was a scary movie. I am not by nature claustrophobic but a few scenes of the close quarters they were climbing through left me squirming in my seat. I can't continue the review without issuing a SPOILER alert since I will be discussing critical movie facts. The movie was very spookily lit with looming shadows and false colors and was expertly designed. The creatures living below ground were creepy and scary since often they were only glimpsed in the shadows. I hadn't expected the death count to be so high nor the movie to be so bloody. I flinched often during the movie due to the sudden appearance of the creatures or from the wounds suffered by the cast. The pace of the movie once they began the cave exploration was very fast and of course with this type of movie a deeper examination of the facts reveals some plot holes but events move too fast for reflection. I can't say I liked or agreed with some events in the end of the movie. I think Juno, maybe not the best person in the group, was unfairly judged and condemned. None the less the movie was very effective in scaring me and holding my attention. The fact that it had, primarily, an all women cast was hardly noticeable. This is not a chick flic. Worth seeing.",8,123,199,18 August 2006
Inside Man," Great!
","I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were good. The story was good and there were plenty of funny lines that I guffawed at. Denzel Washington was great as the NY cop who had to negotiate with Clive Owen, also great, who was holding hostages in a bank. Spike Lee's direction was superb. There were no throw away scenes. Take for example the cell phone scene where the criminals told everyone to dump their phones into a sack. That could have been handled very differently but it was prolonged and stretched out to provide a suspenseful scene. The incident didn't really have much to do with the main plot but it was handled so well you were on the edge of your seat waiting to see what would happen. There were many scenes like that. Ordinary events, well ordinary for this type of movie, were treated with respect and used to provide entertainment and not just thrown away. This is a movie that you would want to see again after you know the whole plot just to see how they went about the caper. Another scene I enjoyed was the interview with one of the women about section 34DD. The tension created with this small scene was wonderful. Will he look or not? I thought the movie was well filmed, well written and well acted. See this movie. It was a delight.",9,6,9,17 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Solemn and gloomy.
","'The Da Vinci Code' was OK. It wasn't a great movie and I don't think the book could be made into a great movie. The book was too much about ideas, word games, anagrams and puzzles that are better read than seen. The movie suffered from too much dialog used to explain the plot. Movies are visual and time taken for long swathes of dialog tends to be boring. In this movie Ron Howard chose to fill the exposition periods with many jump shots and extreme close-ups that I found irritating. In fact the movie is filled with jerky cuts and extreme close-ups. Given the lure of the locales used in the movie I expected to see some nice shots of the Louvre and old cathedrals but what I got was some quick overall establishing shots then it was back to the extreme close-ups and jerky camera. Why make a big deal about where the movie was filmed and then hardly use the setting. Most of the shots in the Louvre could have been done in my family room. Put some old painting on the wall with the actor's head in front of it and presto a museum shot. I disliked the look of the movie. It was very dark and gloomy and the active camera work tended to be irritating. The latest trend in movies is to have a very mobile, jerky camera maybe used to add interest to an otherwise boring scene but for me it detracts from the scene and cheapens the movie. If you need a mobile camera to keep the audience entertained maybe you should rethink the scene. Many, many, many wonderful movie scenes were filmed using a static camera where the actors created the interest not the motion. Tom Hanks was miscast. I like his work but he is best as an everyman caught up in extraordinary circumstances not as a supposed expert who looks mostly befuddled. Audrey Tautou was OK. She is attractive and did a competent job but there was no spark in her performance. Ian McKellen was the best thing in this movie and scenes containing him were highlights. The rest of the cast was competent and forgettable. Given the hype of the book this movie could never live up to the expectations. Unless my watery coke got turned to wine or I was levitated out of my seat the movie would have been a let down. I read the book, ( a good airplane book, not at all great literature), and I wonder if the movie would have been better watched cold. I based my rating on the movie alone since most movies made from books are a disappointment. I would have probably been more entertained if the story line was discovered as the movie unfolded instead of being known and anticipated. It's worth a watch but it is flawed.",7,1,4,25 May 2006
Enemy at the Gates," Tried to be too much.
","This wasn't a bad movie.  I enjoyed much of it.  I thought it captured some of war's grit and horror and the performances by Jude Law and Ed Harris were good.  Bob Hoskins was great.  I thought Rachel Weisz was also good but the rather sappy love story placed inside of this movie slowed the action and disrupted the flow.  The story for me was about the duel between the two snipers.  The love interest could have been introduced and used as in a minor way, such as giving Vassili a reason to want to live, but it took up too much of the screen time thus confusing the main point of the movie.  Was it a war movie or a love story?  It tried to be both and failed to gel into a whole movie.  Still it was worth watching.  War movie fans will have to suffer through the sap while love story fans have to endure the gore.",7,1,1,27 August 2001
The Departed," Good Movie
","'The Departed' was good but not excellent. Jack Nicholson hammed it up through most of the movie. If he had less screen time I would have thought he made the movie but there was too much of him being too much. Matt Damon portrayed the nasty little sh!t I always thought was in him. He was great. Leonardo DiCaprio was also very good portraying the mental stress I would think a mob mole would have. Mark Wahlberg could have been a bit over the top but I think his character's personality evolved from working with big ego macho cops and, for me, he was very believable. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone were good in their supporting roles. Vera Farmiga was OK. I guess I didn't believe her as a therapist. I think she need a bit more meat, emotionally, and as the girlfriend, physically. I didn't see the original, 'Infernal Affairs' so I can't compare the two. This version's story, especially towards the end, seemed rushed and forced to finish with the big gun battle but the mechanics of the movie's cop story was secondary to the story of the two moles. If the movie is examined for the story of the cops trying to get Jack Nicholson it comes up short but the mole parallel story was intriguing and Matt and Leo were great. It was a violent movie and the ending was a bit much. Well worth seeing but not Scorsese's best. His best are icons, 'Raging Bull', 'Taxi Driver', 'Mean Streets'. 'The Departed' was just a good movie",8,4,8,16 October 2006
Blow," Glorification.
","'Blow' is basically a glorification of the drug trade.  Principles are shown in a glamorous light throughout most of the movie.  They get all the girls and are awash in money.  Even after they are arrested and confined to prison their only real crime portrayed is the loss of family life and strained relations with parents.  In prison George Jung is portrayed as a counter culture icon, a wronged, flawed hero. The negative effects of the drugs upon the society as a whole are never broached.  The killings, the crime, the destroyed lives, the waste are not examined.  It is truly a movie about our times.   A valuable movie to watch to see what has happened to our moral compass.  It is another Hollywood view of the state of the union.",6,10,15,10 September 2001
1408," Effective
","'1408' was an effective scary movie. I typically do not go for this type of movie. I don't believe in ghosts or supernatural phenomena and so just the depiction of either leaves me unimpressed. How well the movie tells the story and pulls you into its world is very important. Too often the premise and execution is just silly and not in the least scary. Frank Booth in 'Blue Velvet' was scary. Anyway I enjoyed the movie. It was paced well and slowly revealed the scary bits. I think it was effective because it could be seen as just a mental breakdown of the protagonist, that what was happening was just happening inside his head. I'm going to issue a SPOILER warning here so I don't wreck the watching experience for others but I really want to comment on the false ending. I thought the false ending was effective since it was the way most of these types of movies end and I was ready to leave when things started to go weird again. I was surprised and amused at how effective it was. SPOILER warning defunct. John Cusack was effective in the role of the disbelieving author. He plays the world weary part well. Samuel L. Jackson was good as always. The movie is not a gore fest but is more of a physiological thriller and I recommend it. I give it 7 out of 10 stars.",7,1,2,2 July 2007
Vanilla Sky," Narcissistic exercise.
","'Vanilla Sky' was another Tom Cruise exercise in narcissism.  In the movie he suffers the worse possible fate.  His pretty face is scarred.  I found the first half of this movie to be rather nauseating.   The main characters seem to be a mutual admiration society always telling each other how great they were.  There was a scene in Penélope Cruz's apartment where Tom Cruise looks at pictures on the refrigerator.  The pictures were all of Penélope Cruz.  I did a survey over the weekend of my family's refrigerator pictures and most were of other people or of them with other people.  My own refrigerator is covered with pictures of nieces and nephews.  I found this scene strange that a person puts their own pictures all over the refrigerator.  I wonder if the Hollywood types even caught this.  The second half of the movie was somewhat better in a Sci-fi sort of way.  I had a real hard time caring for the main actors though.  There was no empathy developed because of their self-centered, inward looking lives.  They seem to care for nothing but their own reflection.  If you are in love with the main actors as much as they are in love with themselves then see the movie.  If not miss it.",4,2,4,3 September 2002
Signs," Sappy but good
",'Signs' was an entertaining movie.  The acting throughout was good especially Cherry Jones.  The overall tone of Mr. Shyamalan's films is unique.  There seems to be a quiet buildup of tension.  I was somewhat disappointed in the aliens and the action in the last reel.  I think the buildup is done so well that the payoff would have to be tremendous to live up to it.  I found this also to be true in 'Unbreakable'.   Like Spielberg Mr. Shyamalan plays up the tearjerker scenes.SPOILER ahead.The alien reaction to water was a bit much.  A rain storm would wipe them out.  The earth invasion would be thwarted by turning the hose on them. Wouldn't you think after an encounter with morning dew on the corn that they would devise protective clothing.  Also the alien sudden change in personality from elusive spyers to aggressive attackers didn't go.  This seem to be a common problem with monster flicks.SPOILER defunct.Overall this was a good movie well worth seeing.   It is a must for Mel Gibson fans.,8,0,2,28 August 2002
Amélie," A Delight.
","My wife rented Amélie and since it was around I decided to watch some of it. The story really didn't appeal to me but I gave it a shot.  It was a delight.  The camerawork was excellent.  I rewatched scenes over and over marveling at the expertise and beauty of the movie.  The story was fun and quirky in its telling.   The colors were vivid.  Some scenes shimmered with color.  DVD extras discussed the filming and are worth taking the time to watch.  Audrey Tautou was perfect in the title role.  The whole movie was well cast and well written.  It was filled with small stories that were entertaining by themselves.  The gnome story could be a movie by itself. Anyone with an interest in good cinematography would enjoy this movie and should watch it.  It sets a high standard for use of the camera, use of color and good pacing.  The story is fun, actors are excellent and it is pleasing to the eye.  It is a first rate production.  Watch it.",8,0,2,19 August 2002
Hart's War," Ho-hum
",'Hart's War' started off OK but degenerated into a made-for-TV movie.  There weren't many surprises.  Moments meant to be surprises were fairly predictable and almost laughable.  The saluting was rather sappy.  Did Colin Farrell ever sleep.  It seemed the whole barracks was sound asleep except for him catching the nefarious goings on after dark.  That was a bit overdone.  I had read the book and I looked forward to the relationship with the German officers.  That was mostly missing from the movie.  There was one Nazi officer with a scar that I thought at any moment would say something but I guess he was there for the scar only.  If you like this type of movie it was OK.  I'm sure it will disappear without a trace in a few months.,5,0,0,3 September 2002
Jackie Brown," Wonderful!
","I thought 'Jackie Brown' was a wonderful movie.  This is what happens when you have a well written story, competent directing and good acting.  Look at the cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton and they were all superb in their roles. The story was inventive, involved and entertaining.  The story didn't really have plot twists but you knew what was going to happen and you just didn't know how it could be pulled off.  There were a few surprises like the character in the trunk and Bridget Fonda in the parking lot.  Many people I've talked to didn't like the movie.  They expected some Hollywood Lethal Weaponish crap with its requisite cliched script and formulaic car crashes and explosions.  This movie seem to confuse them.  Unfortunately they are kept happy with a steady diet of that crap and when a movie of this caliber comes along it throws them off.  Thank you Quentin Tarantino for movies like this.",9,0,2,29 October 2002
Sin City," Violent
","I saw 'Sin City' last week. It was technically very exciting and innovative and I really enjoyed that part of the movie. I had a problem with the gun violence though and I had a problem caring about the characters in the cast. I really wouldn't want to meet or know any of the people in the movie, except for biblically knowing some of the women. The women were in the movie just as sexual diversions and their acting, besides maybe Rosario Dawson, was pretty bad. Jessica Alba is stunning but she can't act. This was a perfectly prurient piece with no hint of redeeming social value. I know it was meant to emulate a comic book and I think it did do that job extremely well but I can't help think that there should be some small bit of social consciousness raising in our entertainments. Why are we so surprised when a teenager takes a backpack of guns to school and emulates what I saw in this movie. I don't mind violence in movies just as I don't mind sex in movies. I do mind gratuitous sex and violence and this movie was gratuitous in spades. If the sex was more graphic it surely would have gotten an X rating but would it have gotten one due to the violence. Could it get too violent to ever get an X rating? I think Hollywood has this love affair with guns. Many, many, many Hollywood movie plots are resolved with gun violence. Moral dilemmas are solved with guns. I recently saw 'The Hostage' and it was about guns, guns, guns. I think guns are a substitute for decent writing. I find it distasteful.",7,7,13,11 April 2005
True Romance," Trash
","`True Romance' has got to be the most overrated movie.  It has a sensational cast and, what could have been, decent story but it was completely misdirected.  There was no nuance in the direction.  It was all violence and excess.  Christian Slater was a waste and Patricia Arquette was there for her body.  There were some bright spots because of the cast.  The scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken was good and could have been great except for the subject matter which I thought was in very poor taste, even for this movie.   The movie was made for an audience who would think a couple of hundred thousand dollars would provide a lifetime of happiness and the behavior of the psychopaths in this movie was somehow justified.  I did not enjoy this piece of trash.",4,12,29,12 May 2003
V for Vendetta," Natalie Portman makes the movie.
","'V for Vendetta' was entertaining. I've read that the story is based on a graphic novel that I am not familiar with and so I probably missed many of the movie's references. The story concerned a revolutionary, V, in his battle with a future totalitarian English government. V enlists the help of young women, Evey, played by Natalie Portman, who he rescues from some predatory, corrupt police officials. Much of the story revolves around Evey and her relationship with the V character. Telling more would ruin the story. There's quite a bit of violence in the movie and towards the end there's a sequence of choreographed violence that I found to be too much though maybe those familiar with the graphic novel expected this kind of money shot. The movie featured many fine actors including John Hurt, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, Tim Pigott-Smith and others. Natalie Portman was very good, in fact she was a surprise delight of the movie. I thought she was better looking after being shorn. She's a babe. The cinematography was good and the story was complex enough to hold your interest. Some of the soliloquies were a bit idealistic but that is to be expected in this type of movie. Overall it is well worth a watch.",8,2,4,27 March 2006
