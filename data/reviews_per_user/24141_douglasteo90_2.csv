Hereditary," Does not live up to its name.
","I feel much of the moviegoers here are just like me, prior to going to the cinema to have a good scare, we idiots decided to check out the rating and the raving reviews. What ya expect? 10/10 horror terrifying show was expected, however of course we were let down by our high expectations. Personally myself I aint a horror movie fan, infact I was dragged down by my wife to watch this because...the reviews said this was so good even the reviews from chinese in China. The beginning intro was good, very creepily good, the minature houses, the setting and the atmosphere....the build up was good....but the pace was way to slow...half of the time i was expecting something really freaky to happen...but I was dissapointed. I guess the main scare was towards the last 25mins of the movie, and the ending where most audiences would LOLed together with you haha. Overall- very good acting from the actors and actress....creepy build up to the finale. At best a 7/10 movie. p.s the conjuring was way scarier in my opinion.",7,0,1,5 July 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The emperor's new clothes.
","Folks like me and you, come to see a Tarantino Film with great actors Leo and Brad. Half way through the show, despite having great art work and film that stays to the 70s, all of us are wondering...what on earth is this? Only people who actually heard of the infamous hollywood incident, would know what this show is about. Which is towards the last 40mins. The classic fable tale, summs everything up, folks are gonna lie to themselves, and claim this is unique and sophiscated blah blah blah. Unless you belong to that specific, smart group of people, you aint going to enjoy the 3hours long show. What we have here is the emperor's new clothes dilemma.",6,80,140,7 October 2019
