Blade Runner 2049," A true masterpiece of a sequel for lovers or the original movie
","Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is probably the best sequel to a movie that I have ever seen, & it's on a par ( if not better ), then the original movie.Not to say thought, that this movie will appeal to all, as the original Blade Runner movie was a big flop at the box office when it was originally released, as it was way before it's time, & proved to be a little too deep & slow paced for the audiences of the mid 1980's, & it's only reached cult status as the years have rolled by, when si-fi fans begun to appreciate it for what it was, & that is a magnificent work of art.Just like the originally, the visuals in this movie are stunning, but more so, thanks to Roger Deakins magnificent cinematography, & the soundtrack, that has been written by legendary composer Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch, also sticks close to vangelis's masterful soundtrack to the original movie, & is a feast for the ears.I also have to add that ( in my opinion ), Harrison Ford also gives a career best performance in this movie, & Ryan Gosling also gives a strong & touching performance, & there's strong support from all of the other main cast members also. Most notably Sylvia Hoeks who seems to command the screen whenever she appears on it.Just like the original Blade Runner movie, Blade Runner 2049 is a movie that leaves the audience with some tantalising unanswered questions, & just like the original movie, it's a movie that will stick in your mind for a very long time after viewing, if not for years to come, just like the original movie. However, as I have already said, this movie will not be for all, as for all it's strengths, some will still find it a little slow paced ( just like it's predecessor ), especially at nearly 3 hours long. However, Blade Runner 2049 ( just like it's predecessor ), is an art movie, & is meant to be savoured as such, & is not one of these fast paced action flicks that they turn out by the bucket load.To sum up, Blade Runner 2049 ( just like it's predecessor ), is true work of art, & a magnificent achievement.",9,10,23,10 October 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Interestingly Different
","Although '10 Cloverfield lane' has been package as a late sequel to 2008's Si-fi movie 'Cloverfield', this is by far a different breed of movie. In-fact on watching this movie you can't help but get the feeling that the movie studio's had only added the 'Cloverfield 'tag in an effort to attract more of a audience for this interestingly different Si-fi/horror movie, as they didn't know what they were dealing with in terms of their audience. This is also reflected by the fact that the movie has also been rated with a 12A certificate which somehow seems like another attempt by the film studio's to bring in a wider audience, but they needn't have bothered on both accounts as this movie is a little gem that would have stood out on its own whatever its title.However, adding the 'Cloverfield 'tag kind of spoilt the movie for me to a large degree as the mystery of what exactly was going on in the movie had already been shattered by the fact that I knew that the first movie was about an Alien invasion, but you would have to go see this movie to see exactly where I'm coming from there.When I said that this is by far a different breed of movie from its predecessor, I meant that in a good way also, as gone is that annoying hand-held camera found footage fad, and the amateurish acting that made the first movie such a chore to watch, to be replace with steady camera angles and Stella acting (most notably from 'John Goodman' who gives a very menacing performance).The special 'Alien' affects in the movie are also very well done, although you only get to see them in the last 20 minutes of the movie. I also noted however, that the Aliens in this movie looked nothing like thoughts in the previous movie, which kind of adds to the point that I was trying to make in my opening paragraph.As for the 12A certificate, well hardened Si-fi/horror fans needn't worry as this movie (although lacking in blood and gore), has a few well place jump scares that will please most audience members.Also note, that 90% of this movie is set in an underground bunker, which gives this movie a very claustrophobic atmosphere which only goes to add to the tension of the situation that the characters find themselves in. This is the kind of atmosphere I love in my Si-fi/Horror movies, i.e. 1979's Alien, or 1982's The Thing for example.The movie itself wasn't without its faults i.e I sometimes found myself thinking, well that's stretching things a bit, but all-in-all the movie was (like I've already said), interestingly different and very entertaining, and a breath of fresh air to the Si-fi/horror movie genre.",7,4,6,23 March 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," No Better, No Worse.
","To be honest I think that the M.I series of movies has been quite an interesting phenomenon when you look at movies and their sequels, as it is nearly always the rule of thumb that movie sequels start to get worse as they progress, or at least start to get worse at some point along the line.However, in the case of the M.I series of movies (and i'm only speaking in my opinion), I have found this to be quite the opposite, as I myself didn't really enjoy the first movie in the series as I found it all a bit to slow and talky, and I found the second movie in the series to be only slightly better on the action front having been directed by Jon woo.However, as the M.I series of movies progressed they got stronger & stronger until I became a big fan, so with this latest instalment, I had high hopes of it being even better then the last, as i'd now become to expect, but alas this wasn't to be. I'm not saying that the movie is any worse then the last, but it wasn't any better either.Don't get me wrong the action & amazing stunts that we have become to expect were all there, but with each movie I think that the audience has become to expect them to be even better and bigger, but this movie just didn't give us this as the stunts were just on a par with the last movie (in my opinion), and it didn't help this movie that the biggest stunt in the movie was (this time), before the opening credits, so there were no bigger stunts to look forward to .So to sum it up, if your a fan-boy (or girl), of the M.I series of movies, then I can highly recommend this movie. However, if your looking for a bigger and better action scenes and stunts then the last movie sequel, then you might be highly disappointed.",7,1,3,13 November 2015
Get Out," More a racist commentary, rather then an interesting social commentary.﻿
","I watched ' Get Out ' last night after waiting so long to see it, but I have to say that it was so boring that I kept nodding off. Billed as a horror mystery with a hint of black comedy, there was nothing scary about the movie, I knew what was going to happen about 20 minutes into the movie, & I didn't find anything remotely amusing in the movie. What I will say about the movie is that it is very racist against white people & it tries to make out that all white's are closet racists, which is basically the crutch of the movies story-line. I did however, know something about the movies story-line before viewing it, so was expecting this, but I didn't find out until after I had viewed the movie that it was directed by a black guy, which shines a whole different light on the movie in my opinion, as it makes it a racist commentary rather then interesting social commentary.﻿",5,2,10,23 April 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Saving Private who ? Move over Spielberg, Gibson's back in town.
","I watched this movie last night & it simply blew me away from start to finish. I just couldn't take my eye's away from the screen as I laughed, & I cried.Before I start this review, I have to mention that i am a bit of a movie freak, so I take my movies very seriously, so you can believe me when I say that this to me is simply the greatest war movie that I have ever seen, or should I say, greatest anti-war movie that I have ever seen, as yes this is an anti-war movie, but it is also the most violent & gory anti-war movie you'll ever see as the movies battle scenes make the one's in 'Saving Private Ryan', look like play-school.It's also quite astonishing to think that this movie is also based on a true story about a man that was a conscientious objector so joined the U.S army hoping to become a medic so that he wouldn't have to kill anyone, as he refused even to touch a gun, for which he was ridiculed & beaten by his own unit, but against all odds he then went on to save the lives of 75 (yes 75), badly wounded Conrad's single-handedly by lowering them (one by one), down a sheer cliff face, with only the aid of a single rope, & all the time being sniped at by the enemy.'Andrew Garfield' does a sterling job in the roll of 'Desmond Doss' , the soldier in question, & 'Vince Vaughn' also gives a great performance as the hard nosed drill instructor (simular to the drill instructor in 'Full Metal Jacket'), but I have to say (for me), the best acting honour has to go to 'Hugo Weaving' (better known for playing Agent Smith in 'The Matrix' movies), who gives a very moving (& maybe, Oscar winning performance), as Desmond's father.I've already mentioned at the start of this review that I take my movies very seriously & that's perhaps why my favourite movie has remained the same since 1975's all-time classic 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', which was winner of no less then 5 Oscars, including best picture, but after having now seen this movie I have to question which is my favourite movie of the 2 as 'Hacksaw Ridge' is simply an astonishing achievement in film making.﻿",10,8,16,20 January 2017
