Requiem for a Dream," A downward spiral to destruction with no reason or warning
","There's a scene in Kurosawa's High and Low that depicts a sick drug addict at night in a Tokyo slum.  To make us feel the agony of this poor woman, Kurosawa has her scraping her fingernails on corrugated metal.  It's torture to the audience to listen to.  I've never seen a more effective way to make an audience feel a characters pain than that.  Aronofsky comes very close.  His method is to alter time.  What's so effective and scary about this film is that there is no comfortable turning point in the script that triggers the descent into destruction.  It just happens.  And when the audience realizes that they're are being dragged down into hell along with the characters without any warning, it could result in a number of reactions and emotions.  There was one point when I realized that my fist was clenched.I can highly recommend this film to most anyone.  It should be seen by every junior and high school student.  The party/sex scene should be cut for that though. But if it can scare kids away from drugs, I would label it as an IMPORTANT film. Lastly, I wish to address the controversy concerning Ellen Burstyn's performance being head and shoulders above Julia's Robert's in Erin Brockovich.  Well,........it is.  However, anyone with a brain in their head can see that this is not a film that the AMPAS can give their blessing to. Jeremy Irons didn't impress them with his role as a drug addict in Dead Ringers either.  Just be grateful that we have this wonderful performance on DVD to watch as often as we want.  We intelligent movie lovers who demand stronger stuff in our entertainment can fully and emotionally embrace this courageous woman for literally altering her physical appearance to play this pathetic character.  It will only be with the passing of time, that she will be revered and recongnized for giving the best performance by an actress in 2000.  Remember in 1941, the Best Picture Oscar went to How Green Was My Valley and the curiosity piece was a strange little film called Citizen Kane.",Null,1,1,27 May 2001
Erin Brockovich," How did it get to theaters? Lifetime Channel at best.
","Moral of the story?  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Could someone please tell me what was so EXCEPTIONAL about this woman's performance?  And if it is, indeed, Julia's BEST performance, than why is she the most valuable actress in Hollywood?  She did an ADEQUATE job.  It was good to see Albert Finney.  His reaction shots were THE only humor in the movie.  And why did they find it necessary to alter the truth of the story?  And why did they feel they needed to stretch a 90 minute story into a movie that was over two hours?  I don't get it. The Oscars may have meant something long ago, but today, as a barometer for measuring quality film making, they're worthless.  The yearly Oscar ceremony is a party, period.",Null,0,1,26 May 2001
The Pianist," Polanski is the Mozart of film makers
","Efficient and economical telling of yet another first hand holocaust experience.  Unlike Schindler's List, however, The Pianist contains no distracting sentimentality.  I would have like to see more scenes involving the father, played by Frank Finlay.  He's such a wonderful British actor who played such a great Iago to Lawrence Olivier's Othello.Trivia: Steven Speilberg had originally offered to let Polanski direct Schindler's List.",Null,0,0,15 February 2003
Men in Black II," Tired, lifeless, and sad
","If Men in Black II was a toaster, I would return it as defective. It's Pat, the movie had more laughs than this.  Will Smith's top priority was looking cool.  Being funny was secondary.  Tommy Lee Jones just looked like a constipated old man.  The script seemed like it was written by the concerted efforts of your average elementary school class.  All in all, it maintains Hollywood's latest commandment: Originality is a sin!Message to Will Smith and Barry Sonnefeld:  I hope you guys enjoyed the money that you made from this film.  As far as I'm concerned, you took it under false pretences.  Respect for you is futile.",Null,0,1,11 November 2002
Toy Story 2," Tears for a toy
","When was the last time you watched a movie with a friend and had to struggle NOT TO CRY because of an emotional scene?  TOY STORY 2!!!  This was a wonderful companion piece to the first Toy Story movie.  Rich in theme and character development.  However, when the Jessie doll tells the story of her abandonment by her owner, look out!  Stop the presses.  You thought Bambi's mother dying was emotional? Yikes.  I know there were emotional moments in the first Toy Story movie, BUT THEY WERE NOT SET TO MUSIC!!! Kudos for everyone involved in an animation film that had better written characters than MOST live actions films.  Keep 'em coming!",Null,0,1,22 October 2000
The Iron Giant," Second favorite movie of 1999
","It pushed all my buttons.  The emotions were genuine and subtle.  These days Hollywood simply can't let audiences react for themselves.  They have to hit us over the head with the emotions they want us to feel.  The Iron Giant made me laugh and cry, often at the same time.  The treatment of the villain was also quite unique.  We were allowed to laugh at him a lot.  I'm also SO glad this wasn't a musical.  Maybe the Disney people can look at the success of this film with jealously because it didn't fit their unquestioned animation formula. Oh, by the way, my favorite movie of 1999 was Topsy Turvy.",Null,0,1,22 October 2000
