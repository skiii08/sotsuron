The Monuments Men," Slow Starting, But Catches Up
","Yah, it is slow starting, but then (about a third of the way in) really takes off! The subject of Monuments Men was interesting and I would dare say most of us never would have learned or known about this otherwise; (or am I the only philistine?)
I think you judge for yourself... I gave it an eight... really enjoyed it.",8,0,2,25 April 2020
