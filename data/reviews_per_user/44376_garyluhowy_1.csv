Walk the Line," Better than Ray
","Ray was a great movie and as many said it was like watching the great Ray Charles again.Phoenix may not have mastered Johnny's Voice to that degree, but aside from that, the acting and mannerisms were near perfection.Plus Reese had better be at least an Oscar nominee or Grrr!! I'm writing this before reading any other reviews so if I'm repeating what many have already said (and I probably am), it must be true.It may not have renewed my interest in Country Music (although Cash was a crossover singer) but it renewed my interest in Cash.A great Movie and no wonder it's getting almost 50% in 10's.",10,0,1,27 December 2005
