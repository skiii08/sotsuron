Ford v Ferrari," Brought Back Memories of Sports Car Racing in the 1960's
","The Ford vs. Ferrari story is amazingly accurate for a Hollywood made movie. Like many others, I ran to Wikipedia to look up Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby. Miles was a great car racer but not well known outside of car racing circles.The movie lovingly recreates that era and throws in a first rate cast headlined by Damon and Bales, but the rest of the characters ring true. The race car scenes which grab you by the throat are realistic as hell and heart pounding. The scenes showing the introduction of the new Ford Mustang, I remember very well. There were huge crowds at the Ford dealers and the demand for the cars was tremendous. Car racing back in the 1960's was a deadly dangerous sport with very few of the safety features incorporated in today's race cars. The Ford GT 40 really was fast and could hit 220 mph on the straightaways which is what today's Indy cars do, just for comparison. Matt Damon does a great job as Carroll Shelby, but minimizes the way Shelby cut corners in how he sold his cars, and he was slapped on the wrist a few times for his car selling practices. This is one of the few movies today that I would actually buy. It is such a great story and just listening to the sounds those cars made is worth the price. There isn't much not to like in this movie and it is a good antidote to the real world we are living in today if only for a few hours. I loved this movie.",9,3,5,11 December 2019
First Man," Good, Not Great
","I saw this movie at a sneak preview, and I had high expectations given the hype, but sadly, this was no 'The Right Stuff.' The problem may lie in the main character on which the movie is based, Neil Armstrong. He is portrayed as a colorless technocrat, who is somewhat cold to his family. The movie focuses mainly on his family relationships, and the landing on the moon is somewhat secondary, therefore the movie lacks a lot of drama. This is unfortunate since Armstrong led a very charmed life as a fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut. The movie covers three of his serious incidents while flying, and he had at least three more, that could have been covered in a miniseries. A miniseries would have allowed for more in-depth probing of how Armstrong became the man he was. The main characters all suffer from superficial once overs. The astronauts were all household names but you wouldn't know it from this movie. The movie also had a hard time capturing just how terrifying some of the events were. Apollo 13 did a far better job of recounting the terror of that flight. Claire Foy as the wife was ok but she also had a degree of coldness about her. The movie also glosses over the misplaced disdain military pilots had for their civilian counterparts. The complaint was that civilian pilots by virtue of their engineering training were too mechanical and not true flyers. This was not true of Armstrong who got his pilots license at the age of 17. The movie should have started there. He was considered a brilliant engineer by his peers, and he was rightfully selected to be the commander of Apollo 11. That brilliance is not captured on screen. By the end of his career he had flown over 200 different aircraft. He was a giant. I think the movie should have brought that out.",7,450,682,3 October 2018
The Monuments Men," Badly Misplaced Humor
","First off, these are the types of movies I love, stories about the unusual events that happened in World War II, especially if they are based on true events. This could have been a great movie about a group of men and one woman who did the extraordinary is saving countess works of art, public and private from ending up in the Fuerher Museum or worse yet being destroyed. This subject matter is serious stuff and is of tremendous interest to those who know art and culture and have an appreciation of it. For some reason, George Clooney decided this should be a quasi-comedy which is dangerous turf when dealing with Nazi themed subject matter, even in the best of hands. Clearly Mr. Clooney might want to stick to acting. Others have already stated the flaws in this movie and I reluctantly have to agree with them. My wife and son felt the same. This was an eagerly awaited movie that proved to be a big disappointment",5,0,0,31 May 2014
The Irishman," Classic Mob Movie Based on Real Events
","This was a movie we waited until the day before the Oscars to see on Netflix. It is an intimidating 3.5 hours in length. As another reviewed said, the first two hours went by pretty quickly but the last 1. 5 hours dragged. It would have been fairly easy to snip about thirty minutes off and still leave the story intact. De Niro gives a great performance as a real life hitman who gets caught between his allegiance to Jimmy Hoffa and the mob leaders who are distressed that their Teamster pension fund piggy bank leadership is starting to push back on their demands, and doing it is a public way. Some of the movie may be unintentionally funny, as the mob language has become cliche, and is emulated by a certain president of the United States. Think 'Do me a favor.' I had a harder time believing Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa because Hoffa was shorter and so well known that Pacino's mannerisms get in the way of a more nuanced performance. Hoffa comes across somewhat sympathetic as he realizes he has made a bargain with the devil in his dealings with the mob. This may be the last great gangster movie but what a way to go out, with a movie based on so many traumatic real life events. All of the major hits (whack jobs) were fairly famous at the time such as the killing of Joey Gallo at Umbertos Clam House and the assassination of several mobsters in a hotel barber shop. Pesci is also excellent as the world weary mob boss who know what he has to do to keep himself alive and get people to do his bidding. He genuinely likes Hoffa but finds it increasingly harder to defend him because of his outspokeness. Whether the movie correctly depicts what happened to Hoffa, it is certainly plausible and explains why Hoffa disappeared, never to be found. One apparent truism in mob movies is no one is whacked just for the hell of it and not until all other avenues have been exhausted. They also like to use go betweens when they are communicating with others who may pose a problem. The go between, in this case played by De Niro, has a delicate balancing act in translating the responses from the mob bosses and Jimmy Hoffa. He is the ultimate mob ambassador. This is a great move no doubt, but make sure you set aside an appropriate amount of time to leisurely take in some classic performances.",8,2,4,9 February 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Best Movie of Year So Far
","I would be surprised if this movie didn't snag a best movie nomination. The disparate ratings for this movie seem to be par for the course for movies with a strong political bent, in these supercharged times. But this is a well crafted movie with a strong but not well known cast. The adapted screenplay and cinematography are first rate, and some of the scenes are imposing. One in particular, members of the local kkk watching the 1915 Birth of a Nation film was stomach churning. There was a scene where a police sargeant challenged the assertion by the black officer that America would never elect a person like David Duke to the presidency. As current eventshave shown we are capable of that and more. This is a movie that should be talked about.",9,10,20,18 August 2018
The Best Years of Our Lives," One of my favorite movies
","Best Years of Our Lives perfectly captures the era of my youth, and the feelings of that time. The cast was uniformly wonderful. This was possibly Dana Andrews best role of his career and he should also have been nominated for an Academy Award. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all. The cinematography is among the best of any film. This movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's. A must see movie for any true movie fan. Some critics have said this movie has aged. I disagree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us. This is just a great movie - one that can be watched over and over again.",10,15,18,30 April 2005
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Overrated
","Very trendy to end a movie like that and kill off one of the main characters mid/movie, but in spite of an all star cast, this was empty calories viewing. There were some nice scenes, but this movie cut have used some editing and a better plot twist. This is the type of movie moviegoers hate.",5,1,2,7 August 2018
Salt," A Spy Thriller That Delivers
","SALT is a mostly well written story about a Russian double agent who is a one woman Seal Team 6 it seems. As a spy thriller, SALT delivers where most other spy thriller's fail at some point. At the end of the movie you can honestly say it was a very nice two hour diversion and of course Angelina Jolie as always is easy on the eyes. Yes this movie has plot holes as all fictional spy movies do, but it has fewer of them and they are easy to just take in and enjoy. The three main characters in this movie are all entertaining especially Jolie. The action sequences are first rate and of course over the top but that is part of the fun. I agree with others that the end of the movie left something to be desired but still this is one enjoyable movie to pass the time. Much better than almost all of the James Bond movies.",7,1,4,16 May 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Damon and Blunt: like gin and vermouth
","Have you ever wondered how your life might have turned out if you had made certain decisions differently in your life, such as taking a job, moving to another town, taken the second streetcar instead of the first. This movie explores those possibilities in the context of higher powers and our own free will and how much of it is free. The protagonists, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are the stars of this entertaining film and they immediately light up the screen and the storyline when they meet by chance in a New York hotel. Damon and Blunt go together like gin and vermouth, and they make this sci-fi story much better than it has a right to be. The rest of the cast is good, including Mad Men actor John Slatterly as one of the 'adjusters'. If you like comedy/drama mixed in with a love story and science fiction, this may be the movie for you. It is a movie men and women will enjoy and is a great date night movie. It doesn't hit on all cylinders for the entire movie but the times when Damon and Blunt are together make up for that. There are some interesting twists in this movie which add to the entertainment value. This movie also features most of the scenic attractions in New York City which is an added attraction. And as with any science fiction movie you need to suspend logic at the door when you walk in the theater, but nonetheless, this is a well put together story with a logical ending for a sci-fi flick.",8,2,7,4 March 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Tense from start to finish
","Jessica Chastain as Maya the lead character in the film does a thoroughly professional job as a CIA operative obsessed with the tracking down of the most wanted man in the world and willing to break a few eggs to make an omelet as the saying goes. The film relies heavily on actual terrorists incidents to move the story along, starting with the communications traffic that occurred in real time as 9/11 was occurring and then abruptly moving to secret off-site locations where the CIA interrogated captured terrorists suspected of being involved in 9/11. The torture scenes are not for the faint of heart and are of course the most controversial part of the movie. The movie makes the premise that torture does indeed work and that in fact it did occur, as reported by actual CIA personnel. Whether you agree with torture as a tactic or not, the scenes are hard to watch and uncomfortable. It is difficult to reconcile the horror of 9/11 with the horror that the United States of America will resort to torture to get the information it desperately wants. From the opening torture scenes the movie moves along to other major terrorist incidents that were world-wide headlines including the bus and train attacks in London, the bombing of the Marriott in Islamabad, and the attack on CIA agents at a base in Afghanistan. Parallel to the real events depicted in the movie are the use of electronic snooping to look for leads as to the whereabouts of BinLaden. The movie does a good job of showing the painstaking process of getting leads and piecing them together to provide a larger narrative. Finally as we all know they found the location of OBL and the last fourth of the movie covers that actual mission by the Navy Seals. The screenplay was excellent overall with the exception of some silly dialog related to potential boyfriends and there may have been some exaggeration of the dialog for dramatic effect but it makes the movie enjoyable and at certain points funny. This is one of the best movies of the year and a must see. Jessica Chastain adds to her already impressive resume.",8,7,23,8 January 2013
Green Book," My favorite movie of 2018
","The critics review's of Green Book naturally zero in on artistic merit and other factors but I review movies based on how much I enjoyed them and artistic merit is factored in later. Green Book was the movie I enoyed the most this past year. It kept me engrossed from start to finish and at the end I felt that was two hours well spent. Acting was superb, store was fasinating, and it was fairly accurate as biographies go. Even though I came of age during the time period of the movie I had never heard of Don Shirley. His musical style does combine jazz, pop, and classical touches and it played well on the big screen in 7.1 Dolby. A great sound track of his music as well as other popular music of that era. Yes, the movie was somewhat formulaic but so what? It was both funny and dramatic and captured the spirit, good and bad, of the times. I especially liked the way the movie opened with recreated scenes of the famous Cocacabana night club in New York, and ending with the extended family Christmas dinner in the Bronx. The two leads should both get Oscars as should the original screenplay. My overall feeling is the movie somewhat downplayed the racial issues in the south, even though they were disturbing to watch. I have a feeling it was even worse that we northeners could imagine. But maybe that is what made the movie enjoyable - it wasn't a downer by any means, but reflected the good in people for the most part. Go see it. It is a great story with great actors.",9,1,2,21 February 2019
The Fighter," New favorite of 2010
","I was surprised at some of the less than sterling reviews of 'The Fighter', especially Roger Ebert who only gave the movie 2.5 stars. I have now seen most of the nominated Oscar Best Picture candidates and my earlier favorite was 'The Kings Speech' followed by 'The Social Network'. This movie tops both of them in my opinion. I attribute it to my likability factor. Did the movie entertain me from start to finish. All three of my favorite movies of the year did. That factor is the number one downfall of most movies; somewhere in the last half of most movies, they start to fall apart. The story line just doesn't hold together. I also give high marks to true stories told well, and my three favorites all meet that criteria. I also give high marks to dramatic films that are also funny. Kings Speech and The Fighter meet that criteria, whereas Social Network with its depressing story of the internet generation and legal fights over intellectual property right had very little humor in it. Lastly did the movie have an good all around acting and here is where The Fighter stood out. Mellisa Leo, Amy Adams, and Christian Bale were superb. Mark Walhberg held his own but stood out less because his character was somewhat introverted. When you grow up in a family of extroverts like Mickey Ward did it is easy to get drowned out in the conversation. The Fighter succeeds as a story of redemption and overcoming a dysfunctional family who don't always act in your best interest. the fight scenes in The Fighter are pretty realistic and I'm amazed at how they pull that off. Best of all there were so many funny moments in this movie. My son had to talk me into going to see this movie. It was the only one of the ten nominated movies he had not yet seen so I reluctantly went. I'm glad I did. My new favorite movie of 2010 is The Fighter.",9,1,1,22 February 2011
From Here to Eternity," Timeless Cinematography
","TCM ran 'From Here to Eternity' as part of its Oscars 30 days; having seen the film many times, but not recently, I was again reminded of the beautiful way this movie was filmed. It deservedly won an Oscar in this category. The cinematography ranks right up there with 'Best Years of Our Lives' another multiple Oscar winner. Montgomery Clift was truly a wonderful actor who did not get the recognition he deserved. I also like Burt Lancaster as Sgt. Warden. He played the 1st Sgt. role perfectly, although not as nuanced at Clift played 'Prewet'. Buts that as it should be as Sgt. Warden was more the hero than anti-hero as was Sinatra playing 'Maggio'. Donna Reed was wonderful in Eternity but I found it hard to believe she was a prostitute and would work in such a joint. When she talks about marrying a 'country club' type, I didn't find that far fetched at all. I'm sure I will enjoy this movie just as much the next time I watch it.",10,0,0,2 March 2006
