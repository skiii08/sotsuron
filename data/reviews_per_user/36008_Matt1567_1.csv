The Expendables 2," What a cast! It should have been the first 'Expendables'
","I'll tell you what I did not think highly of the first Expendables film and I can even tell you whyÂ…I thought it was rushed and thrown together (cluttered). I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger's role in the movie was not even needed at all and he was only in it because he was a big name. Part of the problem was he could only film for one day in the first film because he was still Governor of California and could only film on a weekend without the people of California becoming mad at him. It was also apparent Bruce Willis's part was far too short as well but at least his role was needed. I thought the biggest disaster of 'The Expendables' was how Mickey Rourke's character was used it seemed like he had a story around the main plot of the story and it didn't seem like he was needed either (certainly not as much as he was used anyway). Rourke did not have one action scene and it was almost always boring every time he was on screen. There was almost no action in the first Expendables until the end of the film and the editing was atrocious. Sylvester Stallone might want stick to acting and not go into directing in the future (unless he can give full attention to directing a film and not act in it like a Clint Eastwood). That being said, the Willis, Stallone, Schwarzenegger scene in the first film was awesome. In Expendables 2 critics might give Simon West a hard time here but you know what as far as I am concerned he did a decent, no, actually a damn good job. There was an actual pace to this film (something the first one was lacking) and you know what it was clearly because of West. I have to tell you as far as I'm concerned Expendables 2 was a blast! It is not going to win an Oscar and it sure as hell is not a masterpiece or even a great serious movie but it is also not trying to be. I can tell you one thing it was a wicked good time. Just sit back and don't think too much just enjoy it. I mean do you think Predator, Die Hard, or Universal Soldier would ever win an academy award? All of my favorite action stars from the 80's, 90's and today all starred in an action film together and all were used properly to make it work. There were scenes that were funny, scenes with great action, and everyone was needed in the main plot of the story. The film is not in the same category as Rocky, Universal Soldier, Predator, Terminator, or even Die Hard but more like a True Lies, Nowhere To Run, Rambo category. None the less the movie is what the first Expendables should have been, it is not rushed, had a crap load of action, and was well edited (thank you West and editing team). I can also say Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, and the great Arnold Schwarzenegger were all in the film from beginning to end this time around and that really made the movie kick ass. I'd say it put the 'Expendables 2' a tiny notch above that True Lies, Nowhere To Run, Rambo category just because of the adrenaline pumping cast! The script could have been better (although it was better than the first one), but who cares? It was a fun time. As far as acting goes I would say Stallone was impressive he did not break character and you really felt his connection with Liam Hemsworth (granted some of Hemsworth's dialogue could have been shortened during the plane scene). It was great to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back in an action film in a major role. Chuck Norris probably had some of the best lines as well as laughs in the movie. Jean-Claude Van Damme was also very impressive as the villain. I actually thought he could have been used more every time he was on screen he was in perfect character (evil and a bit crazy too). The 'Expendables 2' flowed and turned out to be one hell of a ride! I'd say 7/10 for action fans, and 8/10 for the cast. Bring on Expendables 3 and let's turn that cast rating into a 10 out of 10.",8,4,12,18 August 2012
