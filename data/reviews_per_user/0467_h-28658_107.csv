Memento," Turn a good idea into a really good movie.
","'Memento' is not according to common sense CARDS, and the psychological order of the audience is the opposite, first by the camera shot into a story, and then the complete story into N segments, and non-linear narrative combination to tell out.
This is probably the best technique for a suspenseful thriller. No one can beat the big reversal at the end, even if it makes you sleepy and confused...",8,0,0,6 April 2020
Inglourious Basterds," It's a good movie with one amazing performance, and couple of international figures that could be better.
","This movie is another well written story by Quentin Tarantino. He's very creative in writing screenplays and he continues to do so.

Shakespeare in Love," The script is fun but aimless and the cast is great.
",The film many great performances with Joseph Fiennes standing out as Shakespeare. Its a very funny and warm film. Putting on a play is difficult when you are writing as you go. This interlinks with Shakespeare finding a love or a muse in Paltrows Viola.,8,0,0,6 July 2020

The English Patient," The English patient included a thoughtful plot line, but was ultimately produced in a boring fashion.
","The tagline is wrong, there are boundaries that you do not cross in love. The film itself though was very drawn out and didn't bring any drama or tenderness in order to warrant it's nearly three hour runtime. There were a couple of scenes between Kip and Hana that were memorable, but the rest of the film was very forgettable.",6,0,0,8 July 2020

Crash," Displays a clash between races and classes through a collection of sets of different characters ...
","Displays a clash between races and classes through a collection of sets of different characters with varying traits, backgrounds and beliefs and how they interact with each other through either purposeful actions or chance.

Snatch," Snatch is just a fun ride all around.

Taxi Driver," Classic character study of a man who goes through a rabbit hole of madness.
","De Niro shines brightly as Travis Bickle and it's easy to see how the use of mental-narration became a Scorsese staple. The movie presents honest brutality that doesn't pull any punches and features some groundbreaking directing from Scorsese. The seemingly free form jazz score compliments Bickle's mental state and journey into violent madness. There's not one element of the film that isn't fine tuned or cleverly crafted, and the damning statement about society still hurts today.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Tangled," Tangled is a worthy addition to the wonderful world of Disney.

North by Northwest," This is one of the most famous movies from one of the most famous directors of all time.
","It holds up well over time despite its very dated aesthetic because of the irresistibly engaging performances from the main cast. It amounts to a surprisingly leisurely ride through the espionage and mystery, and the famous Mount Rushmore chase is solid, albeit abrupt. The dialogue is gorgeous and refreshing, especially these days when writing in films is often so sloppy. The plot is interesting enough to keep the audience's attention without attempting to pose a big enough distraction to detract from the character moments which really comprise the heart of the film.",8,0,0,21 April 2020
The Shining," The Shining is by far my favorite horror movie!
",Jack Nicholson was by far the best actor for Jack Torrance and the movie has a great feeling of isolation and is completely a classic.

The Intouchables," Friendships that transcend race and class.
","'Intouchables' is a particularly captivating French comedy that illustrates how audiences can shrug off their doubts and accept the improbable as long as the actors are skilled.

Saving Private Ryan," A classic. My all-time favourite war film.

Lawrence of Arabia," 'LAWRENCE OF ARABIA', is basically a cinema class
","This 228-minute long epic historical film is turned into an enthralling classic thanks to the performances of O'Toole and Sharif, creative directing by Lean, smart script by Bolt and Wilson, and legendary score from Jarre. The 1962 film still visually holds up today because of the stunning cinematography by Young. The movie handles themes and social commentary about ethics and politics during war very well. The themes that most resonated with me were the battle between compassion and retaliation, definition of identity, and the idea of destiny.",8,0,0,26 April 2020
Django Unchained," Amazing moive realy recomend itÂ·
","Django Unchained is a crude yet devilishly entertaining movie that is incredibly entertaining and leaves you wanting more. It is gory but, in my opinion it makes the film more realistic and there are a few disturbing moments but if you can get through them its well worth it.",8,0,1,7 April 2020

The Lives of Others," It is a tragic tale of hope.
","The focus of the film is not the white terror itself, but the submission of some ordinary people to the choice of white terror, and other ordinary people in the process of awakening from the behavior of human nature. It is a tragic tale of hope, a testament both to the tenacity of human nature and to its tendency to go numb.",9,0,0,7 April 2020
Good Will Hunting," It's an incredibly beautiful film.
","The story line and the dynamic between Will and all his relationships are intriguing and emotional. It's a narrative on friendship, purpose, hardships, and moving on. The script is wonderful.

1917," I really enjoyed the 'all one-shot' aspect the film was going for.

The Artist," So charming.
","I like how this movie utuilizes silent vs. 'talkie' film stars in order to create a subtext surrounding the enigmatic 'artist'. Who is the artist? How is the artist created? These are the questions the movie answers, and in such a fun way that you can't dislike it.",8,0,0,2 July 2020

","Benigni's 1000 points worthy auteurship lands with Life is Beautiful, handling delicate themes with a deft, empathetic touch, maintaining an engaging pace with both goofy and witty humour, all the while delivering an infectiously charming central performance that will tear you to pieces in more ways than one.

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Not a bad impression for this director.
","It's admittedly hard to keep track of all the characters, I wasn't a big fan of the grimy visual style and it's obvious that this movie's budget was tiny primarily when we only hear an elaborate action scene with only the aftermath shown visually. But for his directorial debut, Guy Ritchie directs Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in a confidently stylish manner coupled with entertaining dialogue, an amusing sense of humour, a decent plot and a hilarious, yet mildly ambiguous ending.",8,0,0,13 May 2020

A Beautiful Mind," a wondrous drama that poetically depicts one man's ups and downs.
","This movie is one of my favorite movies for many reasons but mainly because they represent a real story in such a cinematic manner. That is this such a good movie that if you were to watch this without context, you would not guess that it's a true story. That is not to say that the best movies are the most unrealistic ones but that the cinematic technique was so smooth that it's hard to think this actually happened. The cinematic techniques, the message, and the performance delivered by Russell Crowe help make this movie what it is.",10,0,0,10 May 2020
The Departed," This is an American style remake
","The movie is perfect for a tight suspense scene while adding a lot of humor. It works very well. The script is first-rate, a powerful dialogue that moves from scene to scene.

To Kill a Mockingbird," To Kill A Mockingbird is a masterpiece.

Downfall," A masterpiece to say the least.
",Film making at its very best. It's also rare to have a movie attempt such a high level of accuracy.,8,1,1,6 May 2020
Whiplash," It's not the inspirational movie you think it is.
","Much of the film's success came from its tight editing, excellent acting and unconventional portrayal of mentoring relationships. Admittedly, the film editing is sharp and accurate, except for a little slack at the end, the whole film is more like an action suspense film, the rhythm is accelerated again and again, the conflict is escalated again and again, the film ends, 107 minutes imperceptibly in the past. The film's treatment of the music is also quite careless, showing the attention to detail and professional spirit.",8,0,0,3 April 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," The movie is awesome, as long as I had watched ever.
","I would like to give more higher score for Leonardo Dicaprio's acting, If I could. I was drawn into the story from beginning to ending.

",It's amazing how they created loveable characters and an interesting storyline with hardly any dialogue.,9,0,0,8 April 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," A film of profound significance.
","I think the director did a good job and the writer wrote a good script. Through the description of Andy's prison life, this film reflects the society's discrimination against prisoners at that time. As long as once in prison, the prisoners are bad in their eyes, they can't turn over a new leaf. And the irony is that a lot of the people in Andy's prison were not guilty, they were just locked up as prisoners because of the immaturity of the legal system at the time and for a variety of reasons. They were tortured in prison and treated unequally. Sadly, many prisoners in prison become numb, lose their humanity and become sad because they stay in the same place for a long time. And Andy's presence changes everything in this prison. It also tells us that, like Andy, we should learn to change our perspective and learn to survive adversity. Besides, the film implies that our legal system should be improved. If a system or a system is not mature and perfect, there will be a lot of people to take advantage of the loopholes, and eventually may cause the chaos of the whole society.",10,0,0,15 March 2020
Paths of Glory," Paths Of Glory is a one of a kind war film.
","Paths Of Glory is a one of a kind war film. I love the anti-war theme, Kirk Douglas' performance, long shot takes, cinematography, and story.

Overall, Paths of Glory is a WW1 masterpiece filled with horror and guilt.",8,0,0,8 April 2020

The Silence of the Lambs," An absolute beautiful movie.
",I loved this movie.It kept me on the edge of my chair from start to finish. I love the use of cinematography it is almost like the characters are telling you something personally.

Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3 is a beautifully and heartfelt adventure with all the characters we fell in love all those wonderful years ago!
","Woody has a nice character arc throughout the film, realising that sometimes change is good. The escape plan near the end of the film is amazingly planned out and is incredibly entertaining and Lotso turns out to be an incredible Pixar villain.

Trainspotting," A brilliant movie which shows us the effects which drugs can have on us.

Rear Window," It's Hitchcock!
","The story is so detailed and meticulously recreated on the screen, that it holds you from the beginning till the end. Though it seems a bit naive from time to time from the modern viewer's point of view, it was a genuine novelty at the time, providing so much detail and bringing such a subtle psychological narrative to the screen.",8,1,1,25 April 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," My favorite Lord of the Rings movie. A great conclusion and one of my favorite movies.
","The Return of the King after the two towers to me felt like a fantastic comeback, instead of lurking around certain scenes like the previous installment did at times, the return of the king dives right into the main focus of what is to come. Leading up to possibly one of the grandest wars in film history, its epic, its beautiful and poetic and certainly emotional.",10,2,2,17 March 2020
The Matrix," One of the most original and creative movie plots ever conscripted.
","Even if you don't like science finction films you might enjoy this one, beacuse the topics in it are very interesting, if you are too young maybe you don't catch them (that happened to me). Although the actors performance seem too exaggerated you could like Agent Smith. Even if this movie is too old, it's a clasic, and i'm looking forward the sequel fourth.",9,0,0,21 March 2020
Casino," Enjoyable from start to finish.
","This is Robert De Niro's shining moment. Casino is more than a character study of someone running a Las Vegas casino. Casino captures the rise and fall of mob-controlled Vegas. It captures how lack of control, and later, overcontrol led the mob to destroy their golden goose. Casino, in short, is the story of Las Vegas becoming what we know it as today. The based-on-a-true-story format works well here. The action is believable and the times-of-the-era feel is well done.",8,0,0,10 May 2020

Ran," Ran is a one of a kind film that really shows the realism of family tragedy.
","I really love this work from Akira Kurosawa from this directing to his imagery of violence, love, betrayal, and revenge.

The Great Escape," A great watch.
","While The Great Escape may receive completely justified criticism for its rather loose interpretation of WWII and the roles of its combatants, viewing the film as a well-composed adventure narrative places it firmly among the best of its genre.",8,0,0,9 May 2020

Braveheart," Always awesome.
",Great action scenes and amazing special effects. The time and effort that went into the making of this movie to make it look so real and authentic was admirable.

The Godfather," 'The Godfather' needless to say defines what is a classic movie.
","'The Godfather' needless to say defines what is a classic movie, not too intense scenes, but the lines the actors' action manner each stamp heart, think of the movie is an excellent work, but to savor found him to be a god, the last time have this feeling of watching the shawshank redemption, 'the shawshank redemption' is more reflected in terms of plot found, character is also very successful, I am most impressed with is to depict the warden, perfectly. 'The godfather' is also very successful, but 'the godfather' mainly depicts a few characters, the old generation of godfather calm, calm, deep eyes, with a vague tone about the dignity of men, 'I will make him an offer he can't refuse' let me have a deep respect for this role. Another mission portrays sonny, the older godfather's eldest son, who is hot-tempered and bent on revenge after his father is shot. In one role is the godfather's youngest son, the second generation godfather mike Stoic, profound. Compared to his father, the old godfather was a majestic lion, and mike was a lonesome Wolf. Not much was said about the other two because of his admiration for the old godfather. But there is no doubt that their portrayal is extremely successful.",10,0,0,14 March 2020
