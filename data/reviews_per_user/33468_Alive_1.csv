Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An excellent Episode I for the saga :)
","I believe George Lucas met the expectations with this one. I am definitely looking forward for Episode 2 and 3 :) What disappointed me (without giving away any plot details) was the light-saber duel scenes.. They were short... After seeing the pod race scenes, I expected a lengthy duel scene, but it was cut short and ended in an unexpectedly quick way. Oh well.. Better luck next time I hope :) In either case, though, the movie is very well made. Every single detail on the screen is well worked on, and the sound effects are beautiful as well as the sceneries. Go see it. Even if you haven't seen a Star Wars movie before. It's worth it.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
