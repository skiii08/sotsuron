The Blair Witch Project," Creepiest Movie I've ever seen
","The Blair Witch Project did not rely on what I call 'surprise only' scares. 'Surprise only' scares are cheap and last one instant and then go away for ever.  The Blair Witch project actually still had me frightened when I went to sleep two days after I saw it for the first time.  It doesn't make you jump when you see it, it actually scares you for some time after seeing it. Which no slasher film has ever done for me.  This movie rules, and all horror fans should see it at least once.",10,1,2,26 March 2000
Sleepy Hollow," This Movie is HORRIBLE
","I didn't find this movie creepy, funny, exciting, or really that entertaining.  The acting in my opinion wasn't that good, the story was boring at times, and the movie wasn't creepy or scary at all.  I simply did not find this movie very entertaining.  And was I the only person who was under the impression that this was supposed to be a scary movie?  One of the only saving graces of this movie was its cinematography, which I thought was done extremely well.  But it wasn't enough to raise my vote too much, 5/10.",5,1,2,11 July 2000
Full Metal Jacket," I enjoyed this movie a great deal
","Full Metal Jacket is one my favorite Stanley Kubrick movies.  I can't get enough of the intense boot camp for the first half of the movie.  From beginning to end this part is just an excellent piece of film.  However, because the first half was so intense and entertaining the second half just didn't follow it very well.  I still enjoy the second half, just not nearly as much as the first half.  Thus leaving me with a somewhat disappointed feeling after watching it.  Even so, this movie is still a classic.  This movie gets a 9/10 from me.",9,0,0,11 July 2000
Face_Off," Greatest action movie ever made, period.
","This is simply the best action movie I have ever seen.  Very few movies come close, but don't overtake, this masterpiece.  John Woo has unleashed an action movie that all should see at least once.  And all action fans should own.  The action scenes are fast and furious, the script is great, and the story is pretty good, and John Travolta and Nicholas Cage give excellent performances.  See this movie now if you haven't already, or if you just haven't seen it  recently you will not be disappointed.  This movie would get 10 out of 10 from me.",10,153,282,23 March 2000
The Usual Suspects," One of my all time favorites.
","This movie is one of the best I've ever seen.  It's just a great movie. The acting, by everybody, is great.  It reaches out with an intriguing story and pulls you in.  From there the movie keeps up by setting up more and more suspense.  The movie builds and builds, until the great ending.  When I saw this movie for the first time I was left speechless by the ending.  I think this movie is a classic.  I give it an easy 10/10.",10,0,1,11 July 2000
Pulp Fiction," One of my all time favorites
","Although I am a big fan of this movie, I can understand why some  people don't like this movie.  It is violent, and has a lot of cussing.  But to me, this is just a great dark comedy.  In most parts  it is funny, and at other times it is just immensely entertaining.  The acting is great, and the writing is just wonderful.  I can never get enough of the Tarantino dialogue.  This movie is just great, It is definitely one of my favorites. Pulp Fiction gets an easy 10/10 from me.",10,1,2,16 July 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Funniest movie I have ever seen
","Where to begin.  I think this movie is by far funnier than anything ever made.  From the black knight scene, to the part with Dennis the peasant, to the enchanter named Tim.  I could recite almost the entire movie to you I've seen it so many times.  And it keeps get funnier every time I see it. There is only one part that I don't like that much and it's the ending.  But I still find that part somewhat humorous, so it doesn't really matter.  If I could give this a rating of 12 it still wouldn't do it justice.  FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER PERIOD.",10,0,0,11 July 2000
