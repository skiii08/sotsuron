Casablanca," One of the best ever
","Full of heroes, believers in freedom, brave and entertaining characters. A true classic, they don't make movies like this anymore. A clean, heart-warming movie with no wasted dialog or scene. Crisp smart definitions of right and wrong, morally purposeful, this movie tells a great story in trying times. Simple and elegant, it makes me believe there was a time when moral ambiguity was fiction and strong people stood for principle. If you want to see a thoroughly enjoyable movie that makes you feel good, this is the one. You will enjoy all of the characters and the straight forward plot. It is a must see for all movie buffs and a true repeat movie for those who enjoy the movies and stars of that era.",10,0,1,1 September 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Very Good
","This is a great movie with a great storyline and tremendous performances. The movie is best viewed in the television edited version because it is a story for the whole family if the language and unnecessary sexual scenes are omitted. I have spent many Sunday mornings watching this movie on TNT. I was totally shocked when we rented the movie for a trip and watched the unedited version. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as usual. Tim Robbins plays his part perfectly although he does not appear to possess the physical attributes necessary in some parts of the film. The plot develops with perfect timing and the music works well with the time, location and story. It is a movie that can be seen over and over again due to its timeless plot.",Null,0,0,20 August 2011
