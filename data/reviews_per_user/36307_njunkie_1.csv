The Blair Witch Project," Just Pretend It's The Cast of 'Road Rules.'
","I thought this movie was good, but very, very, VERY overrated.  It has a genuine sense of creepiness, but it's very hard to overlook the flaws.  What I'd like to know is: a) who synched up the sound to the 16mm footage?  and b) how lost can you really get in Maryland anyway?A friend of mine put it in perspective when he told me he got more enjoyment out of the movie when he just pretended it was the cast of 'Road Rules' being stalked and killed.  Well said, I might say.",Null,0,0,18 September 1999
