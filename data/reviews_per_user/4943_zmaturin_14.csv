"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," The Best Australian Drag Queen Movie I've Ever Seen
","I rented this out of curiosity: Three actors I knew for 'tough guy' roles (Agent Smith from 'The Matrix', Ed Exley from 'L.A. Confidential', and General Zod from 'Superman II') gallivanting around in drag. The film did not disappoint.I did find parts of the movie lacking: There is very little conflict in the overall plot, and of the three main characters, only Terrance Stamp has any kind of dimension (more time should have been spent with Mitzie, by default the movie's main character). Also, I find fault with the scene where a certain part of a guy's anatomy is stuck in a bathtub's drain- although humorous, I doubt the mechanics of the whole thing (Trust me, I went through a series of scientific experiments at home to prove this).But over all, I really enjoyed it. The acting is grand, the soundtrack is superb (and I, for one, like ABBA) and the dialog is fantastic. The insults come fast and are all crackling with wit. So I do recommend this movie. But come on- there's no way those things would find their way down the drain!",Null,1,2,28 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A huge disappointment
","This was very awful. Where to start? Well, of course Jar Jar was horrible (he looked too computery & sounded awful, but worst of all he didn't do anything worthwhile, let alone 'funny'). The character of Anakin was horrible, both in the writing and the acting. The movie moves way too fast, the characters are never developed, and anything that's interested is soon passed over. The characters are blah, with only a few (Watto, Sebulba, Darth Maul) becoming entertaining & endearing.There are several lame scenes. There's the underwater scene where the same exact thing HAPPENS TWICE! The pod race could've been great if not for the horrible announcer (more suited for a juice box commercial than a Star Wars movie. We don't need Bob Costas references in our sweeping Sci-Fi epics). The best scene in the film, the fight with Darth Maul, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Qui-Gon Jinn, could be cool, but it's intercut with awful scenes, like Jar Jar fighting the battle droids (that was either a really good cartoon or a really awful live action film).There's the awful scene where Anakin hides in the cockpit of the fighter plane ('Don't move from that cockpit!' Boy, that gag was predictable) where Anakin can't kind the trigger & hits every button & switch except for the one that looks like a trigger, despite the fact that he sat in Ric Olie's ship a few scenes earlier and was able to identify every instrument in the cockpit. > In short, this was a terrible movie-going experience- not just disappointing in relation to the other films in the series, but an awful movie in it's own right. Perhaps for the next two installments Lucas will get other directors to helm the movies like he did for 'Empire' and 'Jedi', and get someone that's a talented screenwriter to polish up on the dialog (Star Wars fanatic Kevin Smith, perhaps?)",Null,1,2,29 May 1999
Minority Report," Minority Retort
","I've never been a huge fan of Speilburg, I find his movies have great moments or sequences I enjoy but overall leave me feeling kind of cold. This feels like Speilburg was trying to make a movie just for me- he loaded it with actors I like (Max Von Sydow, Jessica Harper, Peter Stormare, Tim Blake Nelson, Samantha Morton), put in a little gore (the whole groovy 'eyeball' sequence), even served up a scene where one person vomits on another (always a favorite). But no matter how Sir Stevie panders to me, I cannot like this movie.There is a festering pile of boogers in this movie, and it's named 'Colin Ferrell's Acting'. Hasn't anyone noticed how terrible this guy is? Why do they keep putting him in movies? He's awful! One needs only to look at the chase through the car factory: After performing a perilous climb onto a piece of machinery, Farrell pulls out a cross and kisses it. Later, when Tom Cruise is escaping, Farrell slams his fist into his palm ala a bully in a Nickelodian series. And it doesn't help matters that most of the dialog in this movie is god-awful.And why does this movie end and then go on for another twenty minutes? There's a point where the conspiracy is reveiled via a character giving a big long monologue (like Velma on the Scooby Doo show), then there's a nice, grim, downbeat ending that satisfied me. But no, it keeps going, and going, and has another character give a long monologue explaining stuff that's ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED. Did the writers think the audience was so stupid they couldn't get it? Or couldn't handle a downbeat ending? There's a point where this movie becomes excrutiating. I did like how criminals are punished in the future by being dressed like Slim Goodbody, though.",1,5,10,22 December 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Yes.
","It was fantastic. See, I'm not a big Shakespeare fan. I went to the movie with my mom & sister. But I was entertained to the utmost by this enchanting film. Geoffrey Rush is especially fine as the comical theater owner, but Paltrow, Fiennes, and Affleck are all fantastic. I would recommend this film to anyone, as it is funny, touching, and exciting, even if they don't like costume dramas.",Null,0,0,16 February 1999
Sleepy Hollow," 'Sleepy Hollow' had me wide awake
","Has Tim Burton ever made a bad film? Some are better than others, but none of his movies are boring, bland, or cheap. 'Sleepy Hollow' continues his trail of excellence, and although it's slightly flawed, it's attributes far exceed it's draw backs. It's scary, funny, and beautifully shot.Johnny Depp is brilliant as Ichabod. It's been a while since such a flawed, unique character was the hero in a movie. Ichabod is scared, nervous, and confused, and stays that way. Depp is hilarious and touching. The rest of the cast is superb, and there are cameos by such luminaries as Martin Landau, Christopher Lee, and Christopher Walken. The film's main flaw is that there are simply too many great characters crammed into it to do any of the actors justice. Jeffrey Jones and Ian McDiarmid are never given scenes that cement their eccentricities, and Christina Ricci is underused. The convoluted plot line also gets out of hand, and the movie must resort to having a character have a long monologue explaining the whole plot (and even then things aren't clear).
One other complaint: Can we please stop having characters receiving a treasured object from another character and being told to 'keep it close to their heart', only later to be shot at, letting the object stop the bullet? That gag's got whiskers on it!But these are only minor design flaws in an involving and visually stimulating film. And, as an added bonus, you get to see the super-annoying Casper Van Dien from the super-horrible movie 'The Omega Code' is dismembered. That's entertainment!",9,0,0,20 November 1999
The Thing," Thank You, Thing
","I think that 'The Thing' is one of the greatest horror films of all time. There, I said it, and I'd say it again if I had to. This movie is almost perfect. The outstanding effects are worth the price of admission alone, but the whole movie is just put together so well: the plot gives you the amount of information you need to understand what's happening but not too much as to get in the way of the thrills. The cast is flawless, with each of the dozen characters fleshed out in an amazingly short period of time. Even the dog is a fantastic actor. I rarely gush unabashedly about a movie, but really, it's a masterpiece. Just the 'heart attack' sequence alone puts this in the pantheon of great horror flicks. My complaints are few- parts of the story are a little hard to get upon one viewing, but rather than there being plot holes there is room for discussion for what's going on. What we see is not all that is going on- the people in this movie are always doing something, even if it's not on screen. The ambiguous ending also allows for tons of post-viewing conversation. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, 'The Thing' is one of my all time favorite horror movies, and definitely John Carpenter's best work. If you haven't seen it, you should, and if you have seen it you should see it again.",Null,0,1,5 April 2000
American Psycho," Psych-o-liscious!
","[This review has a few minor spoilers]I'll admit it: I'm a sucker for any movie with chainsaw. Be it Ash or Leatherface, give the lead a buzz saw to chase down their adversaries, and I'm happy. That's why it was so great to see Patrick Bateman, this movie's titular psycho, running down a hallway, naked, chasing a screaming woman and clutching a roaring chainsaw.Patrick also watches 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' while working out, executes people while discussing the finer points of Phil Collins, and will kill anyone with a nicer business card than his. In short, he's the best horror character in years, which is why it's sad that this movie shies away from true horror, because I thought it was near perfect.Well, that's not true- I didn't like the ending (although it leaves the door open for a sequel, which I would be in favor of) and some parts are a little slow, but overall this movie is an excellent look at what it's like to loose one's mind. The whole 1980s setting attempts to make this movie into a parody of the greedy 'me'-decade, but what really shined through for me is Bateman's ever-growing fear and hatred of people, a feeling I'm sure more than one viewer will associate with, which will make it all the more disturbing when Bateman turns murderer.Christian Bale is beyond perfect as the homicidal maniac who fits in with his upper crust friends and coworkers so well that he becomes invisible. The supporting cast is adequate, but all seem subdued and 'turned down' compared to Bale's tour-de-force performance.",10,0,0,3 May 2000
Moulin Rouge!," What? The '!' is part of the title? How pretentious! Not since the '/' in 'Face/Off'!
","I must say I enjoyed the feature length Mtv video 'Moulin Rouge!', or at least the first twenty or thirty minutes, before if devolved into a hokey amalgam of trite cliches and almost unbearable music interludes embellished by John Leguizamo's mind numbing performance.Anyway, lets say you're a 'patron' at the Moulin Rouge dancehall/brothel, and you frequent it quite regularly. Eventually you would have 'had' all the women there, right? And eventually you'd sleep with the dwarf. Right? I mean, you'd have to, at least once, right? Right? Come on, the men in the audience know what I'm talking about, right?",4,0,2,8 April 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Not nearly as funny as Booty Call
","SPOILERS.It's a loose and spotty movie about Nobel Prize winner John Nash, but at times it could be another zany comedy from director Ron Howard (Night Shift, Gung Ho, The Grinch) starring the killer from 'Virtuosity' and Jennifer Corvino. It starts out like a bad college-bound biopic with middle-aged college students(like 'Patch Adams'), then veers into an unengaging intrigue movie/silly romance. But halfway through they pull an 'The Others'/'Fight Club'/'Sixth Sense' kind of deal and reveal Nash's movie-perfect psychosis in a neat little package (It's okay that he hit his wife- he was just swatting away a phantom Ed Harris!) that glosses over Nash's complicated life, then ends with a 'cute' ending where Nash regains his respect or something at his college. I found it mildly engaging but easilty forgettable.Wait, it was nominated for an Oscar? Uh, it's a beautifully executed thriller that kept me on the edge of excitement through it's roller coaster thrill-ride of emotional thrills that's not overlong or fakey!Watch for crowd-pleaser Austin Pendleton (Skidoo!) near the end, plus appearances from Roy Thinnes (Code Name: Diamond Head), Rance Howard (Ed Wood), Taxi's Judd Hirsch, Christopher Plummer (Dracula 2000), and 'Green Eggs and Ham'.",Null,0,2,24 February 2002
Rosemary's Baby," Nightmarish, scary, and disgusting- and that's just the leading lady!
","ROSEMARY'S BABY is an interesting, well shot, and occasionally scary movie dominated by the icky, talent less actress Mia Farrow. Her presence taints this movie in my mind, as it does any Woody Allen movie she appears in. After her character becomes pregnant others comment on how terrible she looks and how much weight she has lost, but she look exactly the same! If she did loose any weight she'd be about the diameter of a pipe cleaner. Was there a fashion trend in the 60s where emaciated corpses with bad haircuts were all the rage? There are good things in this movie, though. It's definitely the best collaboration between the producer of STRAIGHT JACKET and the director of CHINATOWN. The scene where Mia gets knocked up is nightmarish and beautiful, and the surreal ending is okay, if a little anti-climactic. Ruth Gordon puts in another great performance, joining her stellar roles in HAROLD AND MAUDE, EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE, and ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN. The woman is hilarious, and sexier than Mia Farrow. There's also able support from John Cassavetes as the jerk husband, Ralph Bellamy (best known for the Fat Boys' magnum opus DISORDERLIES) as the doctor that gives illogical advice, Maurice Evans (Dr. Zaius), the great Elisha Cook, Jr (THE KILLING), and a pre-BEETHOVEN Charles Grodin as another, more competent doctor.  Anton LaVey reportedly plays the devil! As far as slow-moving devil posseson movies go, this is better than BEYOND THE DOOR but not as good as THE EXORCIST or EXORCIST III. And did I mention that I don't like Mia Farrow?",5,4,16,27 March 2002
Army of Darkness," Groovy!
","Bruce Campbell is ultra-cool in this follow up to the wonderful 'Evil Dead 2'. This movie is a lot different in tone than that classic flick- this is more of a slap stick comedy/adventure about a normal guy sent back in time to Medieval Times to fight the forces of evil. Sure, thought of as a sequel to 'Evil Dead 2' it's a little disappointing, but I guess that's why it's not called 'Evil Dead 3', they didn't want people to think it was another haunted cabin movie. And I'm glad they did something different instead of getting repetitive and doing the same thing over and over like other horror series. 'Army of Darkness' stands on it's own as a great movie (despite annoying parts, like when Ash illogically builds a mechanical hand instead of keeping the awesome chainsaw hand he starts the movie out with). Ash is a great hero, a wise-cracking guy who's always in over his head. I think this movie should have been rated 'PG-13', not 'R', as there is no gore or anything, just a guy fighting cartoonish skeletons. It's in the same spirit as the Brendon Fraiser 'Mummy' movie, although much more witty.I guess that's all I have to say about this movie. It's good. Thank you.",8,1,1,6 April 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Johnny Depp's most amazing performance
","Warning: there are spoilers in this review.Most horror film connoisseurs tend to thumb their noses at the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels, contending that they are too silly, too goofy, too pun-filled to be counted as true horror, and that they all besmirch the dark, brooding, and genuinely scary original. Well, I took some time to revisit the original 'Nightmare on Elm Street' and found that not only is it not a classic of modern horror, it itself is one goofy movie.Don't get me wrong, I like it. Freddy is a great character, and there are some great kills- the girl on the ceiling and the bed-turned-blood fountain. But there are tons of goofy scenes in the movie: Freddy's face falling off to reveal a silly skull with bug eyes, Freddy appearing as an ugly girl with two big pony tails, and the whole absurd sequence where our protagonist rigs her house with traps to catch Freddy (I never knew  'A Nightmare on Elm Street' was the inspiration for 'Home Alone').  Even the final 'zinger' scene is hilarious- with the obvious dummy of the mother being pulled through the window. So, while I would recommend this movie, I don't think it's a genuinely 'good' movie. I think parts 3-5 are where the series really hit its stride, taking full advantage of the dream settings and Freddy's powers.",Null,0,0,6 April 2000
Cube," S'wonderful, S'marvelous
","This movie is an example of a GOOD low budget movie- they make a wonderful, cheap set that looks fantastic & is versatile. The actors are marvelous, and the writing isn't stupid or padded. I wish I was a movie executive so I could give these film-makers tons of money.Also, Maurice Dean Wint deserves an award- his portrayal of Quentin. He starts off as a hero in the vein of Ken Foree in 'Dawn of the Dead', but his character changes and evolves amazingly, while being believable and convincing.Nicole deBoer is also stunning as Leaven, the beautiful math wiz.All in all, a wonderful experiment, although I would've liked  a more, uh, sensical ending.",Null,0,0,24 June 1999
Evil Dead II," Pleasant Valley
","People are always groaning about Hollywood's tired practice of churning out weak sequels to popular movie to make a few bucks. Well, I contend that not all sequels suck- in fact, a few even improve upon the originals, like the classic 'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn'. Technically, I suppose 'Evil Dead 2' is more of a remake of 'The Evil Dead' than a real sequel, as it starts out from a fresh beginning with one returning character, the amazing Ash (as played by the amazing Bruce Campbell). Ash ends up trapped in the woods by an unseen demonic force that turns his traveling companions into laughing, maniacal ghouls. For most of the movie Campbell pulls off a one man show, fighting the possessed house, his girlfriend's severed head, even his own hand in an amazing performance full of slapstick and character. Eventually more characters show up, including a love interest for Ash who sports some of the ugliest socks I've ever seen. This is an amazing, one of a kind movie. It is relentlessly clever, throwing one great idea after another on screen (the only disappointment is the final, climactic appearance of the demon, which isn't very scary). It's got way more personality than the first one, as well as better make-up and a great sense of humor. The Ash character appeared in another movie after this, 'Army of Darkness' which is a totally different kind of movie than this  (a comedy/adventure set in medieval times), but still recommended.",10,1,2,6 April 2000
