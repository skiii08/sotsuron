Hereditary," WTF did I just watch!!!!
",Would've rated an absolute ZERO if there was an option. Can I get my 2 hrs and 7 minutes of my life back please? Coworker told me about this movie so I figured give it a go. What a mistake. By far the absolute dumbest excuse for a horror movie. It did make for a decent comedy though. Horror writers of today need to take lessons from the classics. For crying out loud how can any of you people rate this train wreck higher than a 1?!?!?! Hope you got paid well. Where do I sign up to earn money giving trash films a good review? Seriously pathetic. Do not waste your time on this sludge. 2 hours is enough time to take the kids to the park or take the wife out for a nice dinner or go get your teeth pulled......,1,2,7,25 September 2018
