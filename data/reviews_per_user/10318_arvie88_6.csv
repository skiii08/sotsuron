3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 To Yuma, The Western Movies Are Alive Again!
","This movie has an unlikely cast, Russel Crowe as the 'bad guy' and Christian Bale as the 'good guy'. In this movie the story is basically about the respect that Ben Wade (the bad guy) initially doesn't have for Dan Evans (the good guy), but later he realises that Dan deserves respect for the things he do.The movie is overall very well made, the action scenes are believable, there is no flaw, only the accents of the Australian Crowe and the Welshman Bale are reason to believe they aren't real men from the wild wild west.The conversations in this movie display perfectly the mood of everyone throughout the movie. The movie is currently rated 8.1 and it is in the top 250 and that's thoroughly deserved! Movies like this keep the Western Genre alive.",8,2,4,5 February 2008
The Ring," The beginning and the ending of the film is good ,but the rest very boring...
","I think this film is really strange. The first 30 minutes of the film i was laughing because it was so funny, especially those pictures, really hilarious.I have watched the Chinese version and the first 30 minutes of the film i really thought it was a comedy, the stupid language, the pictures and so on...The following 30 minutes were very boring and i almost fell asleep. The end however was good and it finally looked like a horror movie, the girl that came out of the well and walked in to the chamber trough the telly, really good.I must give it a 5 out of 10 star rating, the beginning and the end of the movie is good, the middle rubbish and it is only at the end a bit of a horror movie and the first 30 minutes comedy.",5,0,2,26 January 2006
Batman Begins," Refreshing!
","This film is a whole lot different than the other Batman films.I was never a fan of Batman films, but my friends told me that this film is really good, so i decided to go to the cinema and watch it myself.I was surprised by the difference between this film and the previous Batman films i watched.The film has a really good story, The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets are all there, the car (tank) is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting and there is some nice humor throughout the film that make it that i have enjoyed the film very much.I am really looking forward to see the new Batman film in the future.",9,5,6,2 August 2005
Man on the Moon," Jim Carrey Oscarwinning Good!
","The Reason that i Give this film a 10 Star Rating is that i have seen the original Andy Kaufman and if you compare it to Jim Carrey in 'Man On The Moon' you can see actually no difference.I Must say that Jim Carrey really fit in this character, he is a exceptional comedian and for this role he was the perfect one.You can see that it takes him little effort to act as Andy Kaufman, and what's also great to see is that Jim Carrey looks a bit Like Andy, so when you think about all that the film is already great because Jim Carrey plays the roll of Andy Kaufman! The next thing that i think is so good about this film is that the film shows all the important shows of Andy.The end of the film is also well chosen, because nobody really knows if he faked his death.Like the other reviewer mentioned it is sad that it must take fifteen years after Andy's death before a film about his live is made.Jim Carrey play's excellent in this film and maybe they wanted to wait until Carrey was available to play in this film.",9,1,2,30 July 2005
National Treasure," Very Good Film
","This Film is really breathtakingly good, it is a very creative film with a lot of stunts and surprising plots.It has a very good story and Nicholas Cage really plays his character very good.The things that they have to do to resolve the puzzle, and the inventive it looks, i can only admire it.The film contains all the ingredients that a good film needs. The Story is based on a example of the conspiracy theories.The part i liked the most is the part in a museum when a little boy works for them to contain important information under the noses of the enemy.A very good film, i give it a 8 out of 10 rating.",8,1,1,25 July 2005
Platoon," Really Good
","This film is made by someone who saw the misery in Vietnam with his own eyes.With Oliver Stone own experience he showed many people around the world with this film how life as a US soldier was like in these days.I think this film is a good example about the behaviour of the US in the Vietnam War.The film showed how some ordinary people can turn into monsters, this is especially the case with Bunny, but also other soldiers are losing themselves. The film gives a small version of the scandal at My Lai.The scene where Elias gets killed is heartbreaking.The cast is really well chosen and Charlie Cheen and the rest play all very convincing.",9,2,4,2 August 2005
