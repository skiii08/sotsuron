Requiem for a Dream," The most effective movie I've ever seen
","Everyone alive should see this movie.   It makes every other movie I've ever seen seem like a joke.  I am a more disturbed individual now that I have watched it, but I'm glad I did.  It was incredible.",10,0,0,19 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Profoundly disappointing
","Certainly one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen.  By releasing the new installments of Star Wars, George Lucas somehow transformed himself into a complete hack.  This film relies on cheesy gimmicks and special effects rather than plot or character development and it's a shame that it bears the same name as the three episodes of Star Wars released decades ago.",1,1,3,27 August 2003
