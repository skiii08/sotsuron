Ford v Ferrari," I Love A True Story
","This movie is great the actors are some of the best in the business imo and they have great chemistry together on screen. I don't know how much of this movie is really true as far as the banter between Henry Ford jr and Carol Shelby but I know the achievements are all true which are great for American history. It couldn't have been any other driver other than Ken Miles, and Christian Bale did a great job of playing the part it was so sad how he passed because of what he accomplished he will live forever proving that Americans can make a super car aka (race car) just as good as the rest of them",9,1,1,8 February 2020

Ready Player One," MUST SEE
",This movie is absolutely my favorite movie of the year and top10 movies of all time the plot is good the acting is sub-par but the cgi is awesome and what I think technology is aspiring to be like with vr in video games right now just imagine what it'll be like in 10 years from now this isn't to far off but in the end reality is always better and I think that's the message they were trying to get across so much fiction but any good fiction novel has a shred of truth and I think this story doesn't get the praise it should had me hooked beginning to end with a somewhat predictable ending to Charlie and the chocolate factory type ending with it all given away to the best of the best of those who deserved it,10,1,2,29 February 2020
Back to the Future Part III," Good not Great
",I kinda hated the way this franchise ended because I do love westerns and this is not like any good western that I've seen what i mean it's comical but the outfit he wears because that's all he had to choose from it was funny and all just not cool for the main protagonists all I wanted to see was Marty sticking to another Biff Tannen relative which is so damn ironic how his family somehow always ends up messing with Marty no matter what time period he travels to but in this one I think Doc Brown steals the show this one I was glad to see him settle down with Clara Clayton and start a family. I always wished they would have made a spin off about him and his family he started and what kinda adventures they got into traveling through time. But this is good just not great like the first and awesome like the second imo,9,1,3,8 February 2020
Back to the Future Part II," Classic
",This is my favorite of the back to the future movies because they go to the future in which I've actually lived till and I always thought it was funny how they thought we'd have flying cars and tiny pizza's we turn into full large pizza's and also had self lacing shoes (which Nike actually created) that are real and cost thousands of dollars. The trilogy of movies are all great just like Star Wars and Indiana Jones all from the great George Lucas but the first is usually always the best of the three and I believe most would say that with bttf as well but when I saw that Delorean flying it was so awesome and now is nostalgic for me as I rewatch these movies on occasion what a great franchise,10,0,0,8 February 2020
Back to the Future," This is the beginning of a great franchise
",I love this movie everything about it is great I mean except the almost incest with Marty and his mom which I always wondered in the present wouldn't the mom wonder why her son looked so much like the boy she almost hooked up with instead of George Mcfly wouldn't you be somewhat suspicious that your child looked identical to a high school crush I know if I was George I'd be questioning if my wife was unfaithful or not because he looks a lot like that kid that play electric guitar at prom and not like me anyways it was the 80's. None of this changes the way I feel about these movies if you haven't watched them you should if you haven't showed them to your kids you should once their old enough hopefully they won't understand the whole incest part of it I know it's not reallly incest because they didn't do anything but they thought it at least Lorraine did even if Marty didn't because he knew but it all is weird,10,0,0,8 February 2020
