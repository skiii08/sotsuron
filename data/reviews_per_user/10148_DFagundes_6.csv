First Man," A very realistic approach to a biopic drama
","Damien Chazelle departs from the music-driven narratives of his previous films to a more sober, cold and contemplative work in First Man. In his storytelling, however, he keeps the focus on his characters and tries his best to convey their feelings through the performances of his actors. Claire Foy and Ryan Gosling really give their upmost performances to enhance the drama and convey their characters' feelings, anguishes and internal struggles. The final product is beautiful and well crafted, but somehow cold and disappointing. You feel like you should have been given more by the script, and even though you are invested in the characters (thanks to amazing direction and performances), the emotional peaks are not that high for the character arcs. To a certain extent, that was the best they could make out of a sad story involving a very introspective and cold lead man who doesn't have too many conflicting decisions to make. From that perspective, Gosling is perfect as Neil Armstrong. He really incorporates this introspective man who is in deep pain due to all the losses in his life, and through these moments has a difficult time dealing with his family, who supports him all the way through. These conflicts are as realistic as it gets, without glossing over and dramatizing too much, and you have to respect the film for that.
The editing and the camera work are also factors that help to create that atmosphere of loss and grief that filled his personal life, and are big technical achievements in this film. The way it was filmed give us the impression that we are there with those people, with all the documentary-like camera work, the close-ups, and the organic acting.
What the film lacks on dramatic and emotional impact relating to his personal struggles, it has enough to spare on the grandiosity of the moon landing experience. The film keeps its realistic approach when Armstrong goes to work, and what we see is the best picture of what NASA, the Gemini and Apollo missions should have been like back then. Its realism surpasses any other major film about space travel or science fiction, and for being so true to the facts and so aware of itself, it provides for a much deeper and meaningful impact when compared to those other films. The feeling we get whenever he's inside a spacecraft, everything shaking and loud, the claustrophobic sensations, are all very immersive, scary and deliver a great deal of adrenaline and suspense. The feeling of the moon landing is at the same time contemplative and sublime. The sound and the images during that scene put us in the head of Armstrong, and we get to experience what he went through in a very realistic way, and all that provides for a huge emotional climax.
During the plot development, we really get the perspective that anything could go wrong in any moment. All the events the story told before the moon landing were events of failure that gave us the impression that what they were doing was really dangerous and could really go wrong. This perspective on the risks and the amateurishness of all these programs was something new added by this film when compared to all others, that usually romanticize this part, adding difficulties just for plot development, and not really exploring the reality of it. That actually contributed to the overall experience, as we get to feel the horror of a loss, and the fear of something that is being achieved for the first time in history.
The film stands as a masterpiece of realistic depiction of an event, but not so much an emotional depiction of the character and his struggles, as the story wasn't able to feed us as much as necessary for us to care deeply about him.",8,1,3,19 October 2018
Hereditary," Amazing technical achievement by Ari Aster
","This is a first feature film from director Ari Aster. The technique was amazingly well done, setting new boundaries for the genre, while using the best aspects of the classics. The director showed that he really knows his craft. 
The film is very atmospheric, with a quiet pace and psychological tension that held my attention from the beginning. The technique and precision of image and sound are astonishing, and separates it from the other horror movies that we're used to watching. It settle the family drama really well, and it knew when to reveal and withhold information.
The supernatural aspects of the story contributed to the scary moments in the film, and although they were too over the top, the unpredictability of every scene and the technique used to build up the sensations that made us feel fear during those scenes actually overshadowed the story. 
By the end, I was taken a little off the characters due to the over-exposition of the story background, but throughout the whole movie I could connect with them emotionally. They were really well acted, and had dramatic nuances that made them human and multi-dimensional.
A very good film overall, that made me feel fear through my spine in several scenes, a psychological kind of fear the doesn't make me feel manipulated. I can't say it is exactly original, because it takes so many things from other films of the genre, specially the Shining and the Exorcist, but it is really well made, and the way it mixes art-house cinema with mainstream is what makes it emotional and entertaining both as a drama and a horror film.",7,1,2,25 June 2018
The Favourite," Deep, funny and haunting. Not for everyone, though
","The last film by director Yorgos Lanthimos is a unique period comedy that is perhaps the most different film of the year in the Hollywood scene. Lanthimos is not worried about portraying 18th century England with realism.
Instead, he takes a more eccentric and sometimes even absurdist approach on his characters, which reminded me a lot of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, but far less subtle, getting closer to the Coens' darker comedies such as Fargo or a Serious Man.
Lanthimos explores several layers of the human condition, and by dehumanizing his characters in certain ways, and showing us absurd situations as if they are normal, he somehow manages to focus on other human traits with a bit more freedom and depth than he would otherwise be able to.
I think there are several themes explored in this film, the biggest of them being power relations and human desire. The characters are written with such expression and freedom that their desires and ambitions feel so much more alive than usual, as if they are animals who only care about that one thing, and want that so badly that they can't hide it. The plot plays with their desires and how far they are able to go in order to get what they want. We are almost manipulated to connect with the three characters for several reasons, only to be trapped in the moral ambiguity of all the characters we were caring about. This makes the film harder to watch, but a lot more interesting and unpredictable.
The other theme that is dealt with so masterfully throughout the film is power. The way Lanthimos displays the power relations within the characters' relationships is fascinating. He is able to question the very nature of power, and its relationship with the actual utility of it, and the desires that lie underneath. We are always reminded of who is in power at any time, but this always seems to blur into the complexities of the situations, so much that we end up getting confused about what power really means.
The ending says a lot about this power-desire relationship. We are tricked into thinking that the game they are playing is only related to their position in court, and their proximity and influence with the queen. But the ending proves us wrong, and once again displays the ambiguity that lies under all these power games. One more factor suddenly at play: truth. It makes it all most complex, and unexpected since we'd lost all expectations of humanity by these characters. The result is a haunting and intense ending, not easy to grasp at first, but once you let it sink in, it starts making a lot of sense.
I also liked how Lanthimos laughed hard at the face of the place and period he portrayed in this film. All these themes of power and human desire fit like a glove to a political and social satire of the period, and it could't have been more pleasant to watch him make not so subtle jokes and deliver punch lines that cut right through the heart of that particular society.
About the technical achievements of this film, they are all close to perfection. All three actresses do an amazing job, it's hard to say which is best. They share almost the same screen time, and any of them is easily a main character in the film. The cinematography together with art design and costumes show us a haunting 18th century English court, with some detached elements, but some extremely realistic ones. The lighting is superb, and again reminded me a lot of Barry Lyndon, with all the natural light and candles being such an important part of the aesthetics of the film. The music is also haunting and disturbing, and it fits the themes with perfection. It brings intensity to each scene, and is really present in the most pivotal moments. Finally, the editing is also very good, creating some sort of nightmarish pace that enhances the absurdist tone of the film, mixing sounds of different scenes, cutting between thematically converging scenes at times, and keeping the focus on closeups so we can savor the real emotions behind some other scenes.
This film has a comedy style that is hard to grasp at first. We are used to some level of realism and humanity displayed by the characters, and when some absurdist comedy starts wiping the floor before we get to know these characters and before we get used to the tone, it is a lot harder to see where the humor is, or even understand the jokes. Once we get used to it and we buy the idea of this idiosyncratic comedy, we start to really enjoy the dark humor and the tone. Nevertheless, this film is certainly not for everyone, and most audiences will think the it's flat, dull and will not see a single funny moment.
Last thing to say about this film is that it probably demands to be watched more than once, and surely demands to be thought about a lot after each time. This first time left me a bit confused at the ending, with mixed feelings of awe and disappointment. The themes are not on the surface, and the ending is so ambiguous that I could not make sense of it until a thought about it for some hours. This is, in my opinion, what makes this kind of film great.",8,5,10,31 January 2019
A Quiet Place," Extremely well crafted, but lacking rigor in the writing
","The first film by John Krasinski, A Quiet Place is above all a highly immersive thriller. It is crafted with both artistic talent and technique, being able to adapt your senses to the world created in the film, without being too manipulative and artificial, but rather being highly sensitive and organic. It all starts with sound design, which is one of the most important technical aspects of the film. You get used to the silence from the beginning, and every sound that you hear matters. You feel the danger, and feel a bit anxious every time you hear something, creating a connection to the characters. The other great thing about this movie is the body language of the acting. Not only the use of sign language, but all the movements the actors make contribute to create tension, and give realism to the film. 
All actors here are superb, specially Emily Blunt, who gives a terrific performance. The characters themselves are not complex, and do not offer too much of an arc. Their relationship is filled by good nuances provided by the actors, and very little dialogue. An specific relationship between father and daughter felt a bit artificial, and I didn't really by into their issues, and the way they behaved.
The premise the film is really interesting, and the lack of information about how it came to be only enhances the feeling of isolation by the family. The fact that the film was not at all about the aliens, and didn't explain much about them was also good. The internal logic of the film, however, is a bit problematic. They were not very consistent about the rules established so well during the first half, and screwed up a bit in some of the last scenes. This could have very well been overlooked, but it was such a big deal that it took away all the realism build throughout the film. The last scene, the concept of finding a way to deal with the threat by using the girl's device, and the lack of closure weren't an issue, and were all well made and written, but the scene that preceded that (the one starting with a flood), and the way Krasinski's character meets his end were so foolish and undeserving that all that immersive feeling was gone by the end of the film.
This is a movie that could have been great, but was not rigorous enough in its writing and abandoned internal logic for dramatic purposes, although the immersion, acting and pacing of the film were all superb, and made it entertaining as well as thrilling to watch.",7,0,1,16 July 2018
1917," Where realism and poetry intertwine
","1917 starts with two soldier boys sitting by a tree, passing the little time they have before their division is once again called into action. From that moment, we follow them through a relatively short mission, but a very intense one. Mendes is a master here. He has a way to show the horrors of war that is different from other war films. Instead of relying on visually strong moments of death, instead of showing how evil human beings can be, and instead of requiring from his actors emotions of extreme fear, sadness and horror, he approaches all of it in a more realistic way. He relies on the small and more introspective feelings that our two protagonists feel during their journey, and requires from his actors only a portrayal of two innocent boys who have to go through hell in order to achieve something. By doing this, we see the horrors of war as being how that affects people in a deeper emotional level. We see all the apathy, regret, disappointment and frustration that they have to endure due to the realities of war. Death, however horrific it might be, is only one part of it, and what stays with those who survived is a set of feelings and memories that is much more frightening, and which we as viewers are invited to feel alongside our main characters. Mendes also has the sensibility to show every single character in the film as a human being, and by doing so, he expands the whole narrative of good vs evil that is usually portrayed in war films, to a more complex and realistic one, one of empathy vs apathy, power vs powerlessness, humanity vs humanity itself.
About the cinematography, one of the most broadly discussed aspects of this film is how Deakins films everything as if it was one shot. And it is indeed an amazing technical achievement, one which certainly adds to the feeling of absolute immersion. But Deakins does a lot more than that in this film. He is able to use these immersion techniques combined with beautifully lighted shots, sensible camera movement and, in a few key moments, an almost ethereal atmosphere (which is significantly brought up to another level by an amazing soundtrack). What he achieves with this is a mix of realism and poetry that adds an extra layer to the film, which would otherwise be remembered simply by its technical accomplishments.",9,0,2,20 January 2020
Moonrise Kingdom," An exploration and chilhood dreaming
","Moonrise Kingdom has the spirit of a free child, dreaming of running away from all the bad things in their lives, and looking to connect with his/her childhood sweetheart. And you really feel like you are this child. The film has the power to transport you to your early ages, where dreams were more common, more romanticized and captured your deeper desires without all the strains that come with adulthood. But funny enough, this is a film for adults, with no appeal to children, I suppose. The nostalgia feeling is a trademark from writer director Wes Anderson, and although some may say that his style overshadows the meaningfulness of his stories, this does not happen in this film.
There is enough realism for us to connect as adults, and enough romanticism and surrealism to create unique feelings of childhood romance, and desires for escapism. It has an even bigger appeal to introverts, who will more easily connect with the main characters, who are tired of social constraints.
The film has a world of itself, a tiny island where everyone knows evereyone, and a lifestyle dictated by traditionalism and a superficial kindness that makes every adult hurt on the inside. For me, this is the strongest message of the film. It is not just nostalgic and romantic for the sake of it, but it carries a deeper meaning that we all must be more true to ourselves, and kinder to the people that really matter to us. This desire is expressed by two children that had enough, and ended up teaching the adults a valuable lesson of letting love take control of their actions, and being more sensitive to the world around them, and mainly the people around them.
It is indeed a very sensible film, that has very interesting artistic choices such as the depiction of the adults personalities, and the surrealism of extraordinary natural events (rain, fire, storm, thunder, explosions, etc).
The romance of the two children is lovely to watch. It forces us to question all the prejudices and restriction we have regarding children romantic and sexual maturity in our culture. As it approaches these subjects, it does so with such honesty and tenderness that it might sensibilize adults to look at these constrains from another perspective, a more natural and naive perspective something that only children can offer.",9,1,1,25 July 2018
