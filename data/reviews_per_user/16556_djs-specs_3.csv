Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A lot of fun!
","If you have a problem with movies that are played totally straight yet the premise is completely ridiculous, this move is so not for you. I mean, seriously, the title says it all - the 16th president of the USA hunts down the ravaging undead with his trusty axe. A historical-horror-action film, its meant to be silly as all get-out and that's what makes it fun.The cast performed solidly, the make-up and costuming were great and the effects were sublime. Seriously, the action scenes were worth the price of admission alone for me. The script could've done with a bit of work, but you can't win them all I suppose.If your like your movie premises silly and your action kickass, you will probably like this film. Don't go in expecting art or Oscar-worthy material because you will be disappointed.",8,2,5,3 August 2012
Thor: Ragnarok," A great romp!
","I've been rather tepid towards the MCU since the get-go. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed individual films but I've never really been hanging out for the next installment. However, the previews for this one did pique my interest so when I was invited to go see it by some friends I decided to make the effort (rather than waiting for it on Foxtel like I have for the last few).I'm glad I went.The best word for this film really is 'romp'. Its fun, its energetic and its often hilarious to watch. Its a complete tone change from the previous two Thor movies - the second in particular - and its all the better for it. While its a shame that some familiar characters couldn't make an appearance, and some did only briefly, I don't think the movie suffers horribly for their absence. The story holds together pretty well, in my opinion, and I didn't notice any glaring plot holes.Kudos to everyone involved in this film, especially director Taika Waititi. I had a lot of fun watching it and I hope that other people will too.",9,35,60,27 October 2017
Van Helsing," Big, Dumb Fun
","If you're after high art, or even much of a plot, this isn't the movie for you. Its silly to the point of being utterly ridiculous at points, and the CGI does NOT stand the test of time. But it really is worth watching just to see Richard Roxburgh - a truly talented actor - almost literally chew on the scenery playing Dracula.",7,1,2,28 June 2018
