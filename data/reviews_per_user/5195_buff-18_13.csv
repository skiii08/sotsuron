The Blair Witch Project," AWESOME...SCARY...REFRESHING!
","I loved this movie. I guess there's no way that i couldn't! I'm a big movie buff and i like new things plus i love horror movies! This movie was a breath of fresh air. Enough with the Wild Wild West movies that cost $200 million to make and are total fluff. Blair Witch cost $300,000 to make and the actors used their real names but it was real! It wasn't flaky! Plus it scared the hell out of me! Watch it!",8,0,0,9 August 1999
Se7en," One of the best ever!
",This movie is awesome! For once...a movie that doesn't have a happy ending. I loved this movie! It gave me chills and my heart was pouding so hard at the amazing finale! I can't say enough about this movie. Morgan Freeman is always good but i actually liked Brad Pitt in this movie too...and with Gwyneth Paltrow you can't go wrong! Rent this great movie tonite!,10,0,1,31 July 1999
Unbreakable," Better than the 6th Sense
","I may offend thousands of thriller fans who completely loved the 6th Sense, but I feel that Unbreakable topped it. With the 6th Sense, other than the twist at the end (which everyone seemed to eat up) there wasn't really much there. I saw everything in the previews for that Oscar nominee that I cared to or needed to see save the big surprise ending. I give the creators of that film kudos for the twist but feel that it takes more than a big surprise ending to make a film. Unbreakable had what it takes...a developing story along with a twist at the end.Granted the ending of this film wasn't as great a shocker but still gave me a great deal to think about. The camera work in this film was outstanding. We watched scenes take place through the chairs on a train, in the reflection of a TV screen, and through curtains blowing in the wind. The lighting in the film was also beautifully done. I loved the dark, sinister feel the movie had which coincided with Willis' inner turmoil. And the acting was very well done. I became very attached to each character...and Willis' son was a much more convincing and less pitiful character than Haley Joel Osmont's 'I see dead people...' motif.I liked this movie...I liked almost everything about this movie. I even appreciated the bit of romance that it contained near the end. It was so precise and completely 'un-sappy.'See this movie...it's worth it.",9,1,1,5 December 2000
Notting Hill," Hip, funny, romantic, refreshing!
","I love Notting Hill. Hugh Grant is by far one of my least favorite actors but I love him in this romantic comedy. It was a refreshing movie to see and I enjoyed every minute of it. Dynamic dialogue, interesting situations, lots a laughs, and lots of love. Julia Roberts is awesome and i can tolerate and even enjoy hugh grant in this flick. Go see this with your girlfriend, guys. It's romantic like they want and hilarious too! You'll enjoy it!",9,0,0,27 July 1999
American Pie," Surprisingly fruity and filling under a flaky crust!
","A movie about teenagers and sex. This is nothing new. It would be no surprise that this movie would spend it's opening week at #1. But would there be substance to PIE or just flakes. As it began there were a few laughs. I enjoyed the opening tube sock scene and the ordeal with the beer at Stifler's party but it didn't impress me. Funny yes,...substance no! There more I watched the more I was impressed. It defined the teenage male so accurately and comically while at the same time creating some substance. Oz, a jock, explores his sensitive side in chorus and falls in love rather than just lusting. Ofcourse there is lots of shallow humor but that can be lots of fun too. I was especially impressed by 'Sh*t break's' scene with Mrs. Stifler...the 'Mrs. Robinson' song playing (in reference to Dusitn Hoffman's 1967 movie 'The Graduate' about his experience with an older woman ) blew me away! I loved that a movie like this would pay tribute to such a classic! All in all, great flick for the younger generation to enjoy mostly. I was surprise by the depth in this movie. AMERICAN PIE is more than just flaky crust!!!",6,0,0,26 July 1999
Armageddon," Nothing too special!
",This movie was released about 2 months after DEEP IMPACT  similar movie with the same storyline. Big falling rock gonna wipe out earth! I liked DEEP IMPACT better. It showed the psycological and cultural reactions to the impending doom and made the disaster seem a lot more realistic and scary compared to bruce willis saving the day in a movie where there was no acting present only special effects. Sorry but special effects are okay but they don't make the movie. Armageddon is okay but if you really want to be scared by the idea of an asteroid hitting earth rent DEEP IMPACT!!!,5,1,2,30 July 1999
American Beauty," I was in awe!
","I'm so glad that they re-released American Beauty in the theaters. I missed it the first time around and since all my friends loved it, felt I needed to go see it on the big screen. I knew about the Oscar nominations and felt that it would really have to deliver to impress me and live up to the hype. When it was over...I was in such a state of awe that I could barely move!   This movie is possibly one of the greatest of all time. I've seen great movies (Citizen Kane, the Graduate, Taxi Driver, Clockwork Orange, Silence of the Lambs, etc.) and this movie definitely ranks up with the big boys. First of all, the acting was superb. Kevin Spacey is brilliant and we see some of the insanity in his character that we saw in SEVEN. Annette Benning is easy to hate but at the same time you feel so sorry for her. Every actor in this movie delivered. The cinematography was wonderful as well. It had a 'film-noir' look at times. I loved the rose petals and the other symbolism.   With that said, this was an unbelievably well written movie. There were so many twists and turns. You were on the edge of you seat even though we all knew the main character was going to die because he told us so in the first minute of the film. Having a dead character as the narrator is quite original as well. I loved this movie more and more as it went on. Almost every character is despicable but yet it is easy to sympathize with each. Even the horrible marine officer neighbor is a truly woeful character.   This movie is so great because it is not the typical movie. It does not have a happy ending nor any truly happy moments. It carries a resounding message that things are not as they seem and people suffer. Yet at the same time it shows that beauty can shine through ugliness. I was speechless after this movie! Go see it on the big screen while you have the chance! It deserves all the numerous Oscars that it's nominated for!!! A masterpiece!",10,0,0,13 March 2000
The Graduate," Greatest movie of all time!
",<p> I'm not the biggest Dustin Hoffman fan in the world but I loved him in THE GRADUATE! This movie is possible my favorite movie of all time. This movie has the greatest dialogue ever and Hoffman is brilliant in his portrayal of Benjamin Braddock! The twist in this movie is ofcourse Benjamin's affair with Mrs. Robinson and then falling in love with her daughter later. <p> Simon and Garfunkl give this film its identity and no one will ever forget the 'Mrs. Robinson anthem'. I'm not a big Simon and Garfunkl fan either but for this movie...it works. <p> I love this movie because they don't try to wow the audience with anything...its all just straightforward and though it's not action packed...it's addicting. You can totally fell what Benjamin feels and the symbolism in this movie is amazing and fun to figure out. This movie does require the viewer to have a few brains but it is easy for anyone to understand if not completely comprehend. I love this movie. Rent it tonight!,10,1,2,27 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," An overzealous attempt at an intellectually stimulating movie!
","For the first time in a long time I was actually excited to see a movie. The hype surrounding EYES WIDE SHUT and the irony of Kubrick's death before the movie even came close to opening brought out the butterflies in my stomach as I walked to the box office and purchased my ticket. I even had to wait a week after it came out to go so that I could see it with my girlfriend who couldn't go see it with me the week before. We wanted to tickle our imaginations by seeing Kubrick's 'final masterpiece'. I walked out of the theater utterly disappointed. I like movies with intellectual stimulation. Movies that don't impress the viewer with computerized special effects (the Mummy) or gross-out comedy (There's something about mary) though those movies can be really great to see once...I like movies that become better and better every time you see them and leave you walking out of the theater thinking about the story.EYES WIDE SHUT left me walking out of the theater saying...what just happened. I've concluded...nothing. Nothing happened. This movie tried to create a complex web of internal angst but it was only confusion. Tom Cruise gets mad at his wife for having fantasies so he walks the streets for 2 days, shell out about $1000 loosely, doesn't take advantage of the two opportunities to get back at his wife which is his mission in the first place. He stumbles across a nightmarish orgy which is totally unrealistic and a complete a completely opposite turn from the way this movie was going. The orgy seemed to pose a threat to him and his family but near the end we find out that it was only to scare him into staying quiet.When all is said in done, nothing had happened. This movie fired blanks! I waited the entire movie for a plot and it just wasn't there. The sexual content of this movie was used in excess. Sex was everywhere and in such unusual and degrading forms that it made 'making love' look like a thing of the past. The closing line by nicole kidman 'we have to do something we haven't done in a while...f**k' left me totally hating this movie. Even sex with his own wife is considered animalistic and degrading.EYES WIDE SHUT did not deliver at all. In the end, everything was the same as it was at the beginning except that tom and nicole (bill and alice) had a marriage that was even rockier than in the beginning. This movie had a chance to be great but failed dismally...a little bit of it was enjoyable but for the most part, if I wanted to spend 2 1/2 hours watching nothing happen, I'd watch paint dry!",6,0,0,26 July 1999
Scream," Brought the slasher film to new heights!
",Just as movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween were getting tiresome as they finished their 7th and 8th sequels...Scream comes along and brings the slasher film to new heights! It created comedic killing. There were many very funny parts in Scream but it was still scary. It made slasher films cool!I loved this movie and was disappointed it was so copied by movies that sucked like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. URBAN LEGENDS is near SCREAM caliber but not quite. Rent Scream...it'll make you laugh...and it will make you scream!,10,0,0,29 July 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Unbelievable! One of the best movies ever!
","Anthony Hopkins is the greatest in this movie. His character, Hannibal Lecter if frightening with his unbelievable intelligence yet his savage brutality that has caused him to be locked away as a viscious serial killer.   Jody Foster does a great job in this film to as a wet behind the years but smart FBI agent who is trying to catch a serial killer and befriends the crazed Lecter to receive any psychological information (he used to be a psychologist). This movie is very scary but is not a horror movie. It is your classic thriller and you might not have nightmares but it will scare you. Watch this movie! It's oustanding!",10,1,1,29 July 1999
Vanilla Sky," Makes you think in some parts, refuses to let you think in others.
","My initial reaction to my viewing of Vanilla Sky was that I liked it. Though it was not a completely original storyline (it was both a remake of the 1997 Spanish movie 'Abre Los Ojos' and had Matrix and Sixth Sense elements to it) it was a very intriguing movie. As I left the theater, I turned the events of the movie over and over in my mind. I haven't seen a movie that made me think that much in a long time.However, there are aspects of the movie that really insulted the viewer. At the end of the movie, the 'tech support' guy explains the entire movie so completely that it leaves little room for interpretation by the viewer. It insults our intelligence and is reminiscent of the lame ending to another Cruise film 'Eyes Wide Shut.'Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz are all impressive in this movie although their characters (other than Lee) have many holes in them making them hard to understand in some parts of the movie.
Overall it's a fun movie but not a very good movie. I hope to see Abre Los Ojos to compare and contrast between the two and see which aspects of the Spanish original Cameron Crowe fudged up!6 1/2 out of 10",Null,0,0,22 December 2001
The Sixth Sense," Good...not Great!
",I was surprised to see the Sixth Sense nominated for best picture. It was a very very good movie but no where near good enough for this award. The ending was very well done. Bruce Willis was nothing special but the little boy (I forgot his name) was convincing!This movie had it's moments but was not as much of a thriller as I thought it would be. It was not scary of even that exciting. However I really did like this movie. It was a nice change of pace for other horror/thriller type movies. Good but not great...8 out of 10!,8,0,0,13 March 2000
