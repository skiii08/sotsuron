Moneyball," Numbers, numbers all the time
","With a zero baseball knowledge, i really enjoyed the movie, simply for: 
1- Pitt's greatest performance. I thought Benjamin Button was his best, but i was wrong. he is the calm GM who thinks of numbers all the time, yet frustrated when he's alone. 2- Jonah Hill. he really impressed me, although i wasn't expecting much from him. 3- The whole supporting cast is fine without any exceptions. 4- The movie has its dramatic moments without excessive needless emotions, just to appeal for more audience and give a break of the material dominating spirit. 5- The script is at least great. 6- The background score- which is important for me- is liked by me too. it's sweet, emotional, and suitable for the movie's atmosphere.",8,1,1,2 August 2018
Once," A Low-Budget Movie that Captures Hearts
","I am writing this review now while listening to the award winning song 'Falling Slowly'. ONCE is the best musical-in my opinion. It is the simplest story I've ever seen on screen. Its simplicity is shown through everything surrounds it from the camera to the budget to the 17 days in which it was wholly made. Sometimes you needn't a high budget to be captured your audience.About the performances. you will never feel the actors are acting. They are very real. Actually everything is very real, I think due to the camera work. I doubt it is a home camera or something ;) I don't have much words to describe it. Simply, it is a feel-good movie with a straightforward story about immigrants in Ireland, and sweet melodies that after watching it you'll feel loving everyone and want to hug everyone. You know, am so sensitive towards music :)",9,2,3,2 August 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Plastic Linings
","To start, I want to know first if this movie is a rom-com, comedy, romance, drama or what!! 'cause I didn't find neither romance nor comedy,actually. I read a lot of positive reviews and heard very good things about it; unconventional romcom, funny, honest,...etc. So, I went with high hopes and expectations to explore this so-called masterpiece.But what I actually found is it is not only a mere average movie, but also a shallow one with predictable incidents and a dragged clichéd plot. It is too busy; mental illness, sports, book making, dancing, positivity,...etc. Every thing you can imagine is found here, but you will come out with nothing. BY the way, I did not even smile except at a scene or two at most. It is not funny at all. At each scene I waited for the next hopping to enjoy the fun, but I was hugely disappointed.Even for the soundtracks, I think Danny Elfman has done better before. I am always moved by movies about dysfunctionality-mentally or physically- but this time I really disliked the characters; a man who hit his parents, a sex addict, a gambler father. What is more laughable is that these characters are supposed to be inspirational!I can't explain till now why all that hype around it, perhaps for Bradely Cooper who was the only savior out of all that mess, and Jennifer Lawrence who's already loved by the audience. Even those two I felt the chemistry between them is lacking. Every one of them did well but each on his own, away from each other. Or perhaps people were tricked by the the hype and media to the extent that they laugh at nothing.Truly speaking, it is unfair to rate it 1/10, but I did so just to lower its general rating on IMDb as it's much more unfair to rate this awful movie 8.1/10 Hope I watched LIFE OF PI once again instead of wasting my time and money on this thing",1,22,42,12 February 2013
The Intouchables," An inspirational friendship between two deprived men
","A masterpiece. INTOUCHABLES portrays an ever lasting friendship between two men, deprived from the most precious things in life; health and family. It is outstanding on all levels. The script is written beautifully, and it flows very well. It's funny, touching and inspirational. Despite its hard subject, it succeeded in making a good balance between emotional and comic timing. The two leads' performance is spontaneous especially Omar Sy who is really humorous depending not on grabing jokes, but casual comic situations to draw a smile on your face. The only reason I didn't give it 10/10 because there are some jokes, or say scenes that dragged a little bit. I find that it would have been better if those scenes were shorter as comedy needs to be impulsive. Far from this point, I highly recommend this true-story based movie for its beautiful direction, cast and sweet piano background score.",9,0,2,2 August 2018
The Illusionist," 'Everything you have seen here has been an illusion'
","'Everything you have seen here has been an illusion'. it's the best quote I've ever heard in a movie especially now in a fake world with fake leaders, incidents, people and almost everything around us.actually it's not a call for skepticism, but for expecting everything could happen, reading between lines and how you can control others. 
For the movie, the direction is at its best. it's a joyful journey in the world of magic with great cinematography and wise performances. background score is suitable for the mood of the movie making you wait for what is gonna happen. 
What really impressed me is the climax, and what a climax! if you haven't watched it yet, go and give it a watch now at least for once :)",8,0,1,1 August 2018
Departures," A contradictory feeling
","Truly speaking, I felt bizarre after watching DEPARTURES (OKURIBITO), not because I didn't like it while winning the almost most credible award; the Academy award, but because I really liked it. For me, the movie to some extent is mediocre; mediocre actors especially Ryôko Hirosue (the wife) and a predictable plot. Yes it's simple, yet predictable in many places. This contradictory feeling may come out of its witty execution dealing with an intense issue (death and probably life) that could have been handled through an overly dramatic way, but what really fascinating is being crafted in such light heartedly way. The first part has its reasonable share of humor but not slapstick comedy, then it deepens gradually to have its moving and emotional scenes supported by such a great sentimental score. Cinematography is also great and has its impact on delivering the scenes. What seems to be great fun is discovering more about the Japanese culture and traditions in a more rural but honest way, rather than the usual image of modern Japan, the matter that is reflected even in using a classical orchestral score. At last, a resonant line saying 'What I believed to be my dream, was probably not my real dream' makes one think and may it be a turning point in someone's life as it was for Daigo.",8,0,0,15 April 2013
Hitch," Funny Equation
","Funny+romantic+slapstick but without platitude+Will Smith=2 hours of laughing=Hitch Will Smith used all his charismatic abilities and shined in the role of a date doctor/expert who knows what works with women but fails with his woman. It's lighthearted and there are scenes you will laugh out loud at especially those with Kevin James. It gives you, Guys advices about how to deal with your love, and the most important one is to be yourself, she will love you for who you are.",7,0,0,2 August 2018
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Not your typical war movie
","I am a big fan of war movies, and I was thinking that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was the best, but i was wrong. In my opinion THE BROTHERHOOD OF WAR surpasses them all. Am I exaggerating?! no.. What makes this movie special-at least for me- is: -so realistic battle scenes and emotions showing horrors of war and not glorifying it like other movies. -dealing not only with war crimes, but also with the government crimes towards its own people. -asking what is patriotism and which bond is stronger;to one's family or to his country? -great cast and smooth, yet powerful background score-reminded me of the same effect of that of BRAVE HEART had on upon me. Some Westerns may think of it as being kinda over-dramatic, but I see it's a part of the Eastern tradition in general, and actually it is justifiable here;the movie is more than some graphics which are very realistic. NOTE: 'The Korean War is an obvious example that there is no winner and loser in wars, only losers. There was no peace treaty, only a cease fire'",10,0,0,6 September 2015
La Vie En Rose," A Biopic of A Woman Who Slept in The Streets
","La Vie En Rose, the movie, is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, being a biopic of a woman who slept in the streets passing through tragedies all through her life and stood on stage at her latest days to sing Je Ne Regrette Rien. 
The movie belongs to Martion Cotillard. Actually she is the strongest point in the movie, and it's her best role till date. No wonder she got an Oscar award and became the second non-English-speaking actress to have such award. 
Everything is suitable for the movie's dark theme,character and era, being it the makeup, the lights and the background score, which I liked how it is used during certain scenes near the end. 
In short..it's excellent and recommended for everyone",9,0,0,1 August 2018
