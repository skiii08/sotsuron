Black Swan," Pornographic
","This is lesbian hardcore porn wrapped up in a little girl's pink and white dream life (and bedroom). It doesn't get much more perverse than that. There is the message that pursuit of perfection leads to ruin, but it is lost in the blood, violence, and--again--the pornography that the director decides to use. This movie was hyped, but it fails to deliver. Too bad. It could have been great. As it stands, I give it a 1 because I can't give it anything lower. I expect so much more from Keira Knightley. Not so much from the high-school faced 'star' of That 70's Show (which had nothing to do with the 70s. I know. I was there.)",1,2,9,7 December 2017
Green Street Hooligans," Touching, Violent, Informative
","I reckon this film shows the world of the football hooligan. Football fans were a bit different in Ireland where hurling is the national sport and so garners most of the excitement. I like this film for the humanity, not being at all a sports fan myself.",8,0,1,28 June 2018
Once Upon a Time in America," What's All the Hoopla About?
","Another glorification of the criminal lowlife aspect of society, and nothing more. Maybe the director wanted to glorify, or maybe he wanted to show the barbaric brutality of mobsters, or maybe he wanted to do both. That's the way this viewer felt, anyway, while watching. There are glorification scenes a'plenty, and then there's the rape scene in the back of the hired car where all beauty and piety and loveliness and pure love and righteousness are maligned in such a way that you really wish the driver of the vehicle puts an end to the perpetrator then and there, let the cards fall where they may with the criminal's syndicate lifelong friends. There are far better mobster films out there, most of them produced during the Noir era of Hollywood because the director's of that era hated crime and what these monkeys were doing to Hollywood and the rest of the world. Bugsy Siegel, who has a small role in this film, in real life tried to be a movie star but was rejected not because of his looks but because of his egregious lifestyle. I mean, 'Murder, Inc.' Really? What a loser. And on top of all that, this alleged 'masterpiece' is filled with rape, under-aged sexual activity (how did Leone get permissions for these child actors to play such horrid parts?), and elongated scenes that would make a prostitute blush.",1,5,16,27 August 2018
The Legend of 1900," I'll Never Watch Another Movie Again!
","'I'll never watch another movie again!' cried my sweet-hearted wife as she wept uncontrollably as the final scene ended. Touched, I wept with her, but made no such vow. She may not keep the vow either, but I can see why she said what she did. This was my second viewing, her first. This time, though, I was deeply touched by everything in the film. 12 years ago, when I first saw it, it was fun, interesting, and for me a real salvation for an actor--Tim Roth--who normally plays the bad guy. Today I can easily say that of the thousands of films I have seen, this one out-ranks all of them--definitely is #1 in my book. I honestly can think of no other great film that is as good. Mary Poppins comes to mind, but still doesn't make the grade like this one. Oh, and we love, love, love Jazz. There's Ragtime here, and Dixieland, and Roaring 20s Jazz, and other Jazz styles--and even quite a bit of Classical. Roger Waters even steps in for one of his classic solos written for this film--and I'm a big Pink Floyd fan because of, you guessed it, their Jazz influence. I've gushed enough, I guess, but see this one, then get a copy for yourself, and watch it once a year--to remind yourself that the inner world, the inner kingdom, is far and away better than anything that world out there has to offer. Anything.",10,9,10,21 February 2018
Straight Outta Compton," Dee Barnes
","I would have given this film a better rating if the Dre/Dee Barnes incident had been included. Maybe a 6 for authenticity or something. I've been in South Central at midnight--and places in L.A. just as dangerous. So I've brushed shoulders with those who have been marginalized and have not looked to Jesus for their salvation but to drugs, sex, and money/power--all of which fail every one of us in the end. Anyway, this film should be Rated X even if for the one scene alone that shows actual cunnilingus and very possibly coitus, though the latter could have been simulated. But the Dee Barnes attack by Dr. Dre was never mentioned, and this is wrong. It should have been. It's an important part of the picture. Without it, the NWA crew are mostly made out to be good guys battling White America. But as rapper Sevin of HOGMOB so adroitly puts it, 'It's not a skin issue, it's a sin issue.'",1,2,10,12 March 2018
