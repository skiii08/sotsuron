The Lobster," What???
","Okay. Maybe it's me but I don't get it.
You have 45 days to find a mate or be turned into an animal.
But, the people don't seem to be doing much to find a mate.
Obviously, David enjoyed sex because it's one of the first 
things he and the 'heartless woman' did when they got together.
Yet, he turned down the biscuit girl for sex. 45 DAYS and his
time was clearly running out. They at LEAST had sex in
common which was SOMETHING. He had virtually
NOTHING in common with the heartless woman.
If you are going to fake a relationship, fake being
a sexaholic instead of being emotionless. Yes???
A lot more fun. And, what was up with the Lonelys. Why the
rule of no hook-ups?? It seems not a very good way
to live being hunted all the time and if you got hooked 
up you wouldn't be in violation of the law anymore. 
Or did I miss something?? It seems they would WANT to be
hooked up to live in the city. And what as up with the donkey? I know, I know..
probably some ex-husband or something But
why leave it unexplained?They left TOO much unexplained. Seemed to me
they were trying to leave as much as they could
unexplained as possible. A good story needs to be explained well enough
to understand what you just watched.",1,5,6,21 January 2018
