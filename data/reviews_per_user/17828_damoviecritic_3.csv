Alien 3," A lot like the first one
","I am one of the people who doesn't dislike this film because it is different, but because it wasn't different enough. Oh no, there is an alien behind you. Look out, it is picking you off one by one. I really didn't think it even tried to do something else. I would've preferred Alien 4 to this one if that one wasn't campy. However, if you liked the first Alien the best out of all the movies, you will probably enjoy this film more than I did. I just kinda enjoyed the combat of Aliens more than the thriller movies. However, Alien was one of the first to do this, so it is a testament to the timelessness of it's concept which we younger viewers take for granted.",8,347,362,9 January 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," I liked a lot of it at least...
","Wow, talk about a movie screwing itself up by going too far. To start off, I have seen Cannibal Halocaust, the Saw movies, Hostel, and all of the other graphic horror staples. However, this one is definitely gunning for first place in terms of realistic violence.The movie starts off very well. There is an opening scene with pickaxe slaughter. An idyllic American family is introduced. The creep factor and tension builds. It was all going pretty well, until the mutants set the father on fire. This was shown in gruesome, graphic detail, complete with screaming and skin melting. Then, a pair of mutants breaks into the family's trailer. The start off by raping the 15-16 year old daughter. This is shown in fairly gruesome, repulsive detail. Then, one of the mutants finds the family parrots. He then bites one's head off gruesomely on screen, and then tips the body allowing the blood to flow into his mouth. The older daughter of about 20 walks in. The mutant holds a gun to this daughter's baby and threatens to shoot him. He then pulls up her shirt and fondle's her breast. Believe me, it is not arousing in the least. The girl's mother is then shot, and the older girl who was previously molested was shot in the head. The baby is then stolen by the mutants.After that, the remaining family members attempt to recover their stolen baby. Much carnage by the way of pickaxe ensues. The movie ends with the oldest family member returning triumphantly with the baby. The end of their ordeal has come. All has well. or is it? If the description of the family invasion scene does not sound like something that will bother you, then go ahead and check out the flick. It is pretty good. However, I did not realize the amount of violence I was getting into. Therefore, these horrific acts of violence detracted from the film immensely. It crossed a boundary with me. If you can easily stomach graphic violence, then go ahead. It's not a bad film. But if you are revolted by the descriptions, you might want to pass this one up.",5,0,0,18 August 2007
Gangs of New York," just as horrific as anything Orwell ever created
","When I first Say Gangs of New York, the film caused me to be sickened at so many levels. The treatment of women was disturbing. The treatment of the immigrants was disturbing. The horror and the poverty of that time and place was conveyed on such a visceral level. The battle scene in particul needs a mention.The battle in its self is one that is quite different than the LOTR battles often depicted. Rather, we see a chaotic battlefield in which all one can do is slash at anything nearby that moves. The fact that Martian decided to use the techno music, while it might not've added much, it was made very well to fit the mood. Must of all, the sight of the kids watching the battle was something that made me realize how such kids might carry on the cycle of violence.So much praise has been reaped on Daniel Lewis, so I don't think I can add much. However, I will dutifully acknowledge that watching him chew up the scenery was the high point of the movie.The movie's length served the movie well, I thought. Even subplots like the election that might not've added much to the movie did help create the mood.the movie did have a few things the I didn't care for. The whole thing with Bill having a crystal eye was confusing and slightly unrealistic. Diaz's character really only served as a love interest. Worst of all, the ending was not nearly as climactic as the rest of the movie had led up to. All and all though, trulely a masterpiece of modern cinema.",8,0,2,5 February 2007
