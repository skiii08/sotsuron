Deepwater Horizon," Crude disaster that cost BP $54 Billion
","Peter Berg's explosive and dramatic true life disaster movie about Deepwater Horizon's crude blowout on 20th April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. The director explores the tragic story of corporate greed, faulty equipment, power failures, computer crashes,leaks, human error and the failure to heed prior safety warnings from March 10ths and 21st incidents. Clear cast with Mark Wahlberg, Kate Hudson and Kurt Russell but the script over focuses on Walhberg's story at the expense of his 125 coworkers. Berg concentrates on six characters making it difficult to follow the real story of those who lost their lives. Although the film makes no claim to be accurate, the fact it is a true story hints it is documentary. Respect is paid in the final film credits to those who lost their lives.The film is dramatic and captivating with indiscreet digs at BP Directors J.Brown and T.Hayward but fails to explain Deepwater Horizon's aftermath and the resulting litigation against BP, guilty of 11 cases of manslaughter. As BP blamed Transocean (Hyundai) Halliburton & Cameron and action $40 billion in lawsuits. The US Government received a $18.7 billion settlement from BP. BP estimate it will cost a total of $54 billion in fines, settlement and clean up costs as over 700,000 gallons of crude oil went into the sea over 87 days, damaging wildlife and the environment.Expensive production, pyrotechnics, cast script conflicts, survival story line should guarantee return on the director's investment and send out a powerful reminder of BPs unforgivable record of 11 cases of corporate manslaughter, neglect, safety failures and corporate greed.",1,13,29,1 October 2016
