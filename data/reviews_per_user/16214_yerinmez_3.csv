Ford v Ferrari," Still shaking from the engines
",2.5 hours and not a single second boring. Good actors and story. Very good directing by Mangold. Racing movies should be like this one because you think your the driver of the cars. This movie is made for theaters and not for TV. A must see.,10,13,33,14 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Why George
",Did you sell your SW world to Disney. It's not SW i watched 43 years ago. But if you watched all the SW movies you have to watch this one also. It's not bad but it has too much Disney in it. I hope this one was the last one and JJ will create his own SW world. That would make sense to me.,7,1,11,19 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Not the best Marvel movie
",This movie is only made for Marvel fans. Not like the other 21 Marvel movies. They were entertaining every moviegoer.But Endgame will entertain especially Marvel fans.,3,55,117,25 April 2019
