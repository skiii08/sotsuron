Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Light-saber fighting at its best!
","Episode I, like episodes IV, V, and VI, contains many elements that stick with the viewer and are not soon forgotten.  I watched the movie five different times and each subsequent viewing revealed extra details that were not picked up on previous viewings.In my opinion, Episode I is one of the best movies ever made.  The light-saber fight scenes are unequaled.  All good action movies must have a powerful force on the side of good and a seemingly more powerful force on the dark side.  Darth Maul is this more powerful force.  I was impressed with the design of characters in Episode I; however, Darth Maul was the character that drew me back to the cinema to watch this film again and again.Episode I is a great movie from all viewpoints.  Any faults that may be pointed out are justified by other features in the movie in my opinion. This movie is a must on my DVD wishlist!",10,5,7,2 December 2000
