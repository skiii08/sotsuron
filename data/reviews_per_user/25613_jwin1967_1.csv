Vertigo," Truly, a masterpiece!
","I agree with whomever said that this picture is worth watching over and over again. The story was, by and large, a departure from most love stories and other mysteries. Records show that it was not well received at the time of its release, but time changes everything, it seems. Today, Vertigo is highly acclaimed, and worth viewing repeatedly. Jimmy Stewart is at his very best in the starring role, and Kim Novak was perfect as his leading lady. Incidentally, this was the first time I'd seen her in films, when I saw this for the first time in 1988. That was the first of countless times I have seen it. I have the VHS and DVD versions of Vertigo. I agree with the statement that Vertigo has a quality of a filmed dream. Great movie!",10,3,7,7 July 2012
