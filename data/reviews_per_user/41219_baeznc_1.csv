The Lobster," A contemporary must see
","The purpose of this film is not to tell a straight forward story or an well know or mediumly talked subject, or even to teach a social message.This film is a description of a world that can be called extreme or fantasious by our actual standards (and im being soft because our actual world can be worst) but i think is not supposed to convince us that our world is like that, or should be like that. Of course, filmed in common scenario, including well know actors performing in real locations, can lead us to think that it telling us a story of today, but it isn't, and i think thats were some people didn't like it.The best way to look at this movie is like seeing a duck decoy, of course, it doesn't cuack, it doesn't fly, it doesn't swim, because it is not supposed to be a real duck even if it looks like one; however, in the job of atraccting ducks by using a well crafted piece of wood and high skill painting, its wonderful and works great.Finally and talking about the actors and goriness or if, i think that particular ingredients are the directors view of how to tell this particularly story, and in my opinion their impact is well fitted to the kind of story hes tryng to tell.",9,0,1,9 February 2017
