Saturday Night Fever," You're a Cliché...
","...you're nowhere, on your way to no place...My appreciation of this movie just intensifies as time passes and I get older.
It is a perfect snapshot of an era (albeit the much maligned 'disco era'), a time, a place.
Exactly what cinema exists for.Having relocated to nyc in the '90's, i feel blessed to have made a point of visiting the very real 2001 Odyssey club, in the year 2001, just for fun. And before it was demolished as part of Brooklyn's then booming gentrification.And it is simply a brilliant coming of age piece. Travolta was electrifying in it. The perfect second act to Vinny Barbarino.

Crash," The More Things Change...
","(dot) (dot) (dot) the more they stay the same.
'Prescient' would be the word for this movie today in the era of Trump. I loved it when it was released 15 years ago; but watching it today it takes on such an urgent meaningfulness. Could anyone in 2004 have imagined that in 2019 we would seriously be debating whether or not our president is an actual white supremacist who has clear and definite white supremacist/nationalist backers??? And an embarrassing, undignified, Twitter clown?
Message: we need serious change NOW.",10,2,3,18 August 2019
Get Out," Hugely Disappointed
","Didn't have a chance to see it in theater, so was psyched that FX was showing it tonight. The hype when it was released was inescapable.Zero suspense, completely predictable, yes I get it. In the first five minutes. Watch 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' instead. Not a horror movie
(which 'Get Out' claimed to be, though nothing really horrifying about it), but a much more sensitive, intelligent, and interesting study of racial issues.",4,14,21,20 May 2019
Moulin Rouge!," Best 2001 Picture
","The fact that it didn't win still mystifies me.
'Chicago' became the consolation winner for 2002.
In 2001 Moulin Rouge became the only film when a sold-out audience in NYC's huge, legendary, Ziegfeld theater applauded frequently during the movie and gave a unanimous, deafening, standing ovation at the end that I have ever witnessed. It was very much like experiencing a brilliant Bway musical, which hopefully will be a much anticipated actuality when a stage version opens on Broadway this summer!!...
God I hope it translates.

Elysium," Extreme Trump 2154
","This film is, um, interesting?, viewed through that particularly warped lens. Undocumented aliens, class warfare, power v. powerless, etc...(dot, dot, dot,) Kinda nuts given the current political climate.That being said, this film is just awful. It should be considered an embarrassment for Mr. Damon and Ms. Foster. Her performance in particular was indescribably and unexpectedly awful. Makes one wonder if she was ill or somehow personally distressed at the time. Worth a watch just to witness it.The CGI is very well done, otherwise this offering would be zero stars.",2,0,6,1 August 2019
Pretty Woman," Coal in your Soul
","...if you hated this movie. And a hypocrite no doubt. This is indeed Pygmalion for 1990. A pure delight; Julia shines; and probably one of Geer's last truly sexy bits. Julia's revenge on Rodeo Drive is one for the ages. A bit saccharine at times, but still worth the watch. Get over it haters!",7,0,1,6 May 2018
Les Misérables," Would Have Been a 10+
","If not for the inexcusable choice of Russell Crowe for such a major character requiring a stellar voice. Of course he is a proven, sometimes magnificent actor. But the minute he lets those sung notes go, cringeworthy sadness ensues. How could he have been chosen for such an iconic role?Anne Hathaway soars (cue the tears) and Hugh Jackman shines.
Crowe...stick to acting. Your singing voice is embarrassingly laughable.",9,1,1,16 June 2019
Jaws," 'We're gonna need a bigger boat'...
","It is remarkable that this iconic line was ad-lobbed by Roy Scheider!!As a very young boy I was obsessed with Benchley's novel. And waited with bated breath for this film's release that summer. There aren't enough adjectives to describe my, and all those 1975 audiences', rapturous response.A rare case where a film adaptation of a fascinating novel is equal to, if not better than, the book.And that score!!! So Hitchcockian. The 4th character in the movie! I actually went out and bought the soundtrack ALBUM :)Seeing it countless times, it's brilliance never pales. Perfect viewing on a warm August afternoon...",10,0,2,6 August 2019
Arrival," If '2001' is the platinum standard...
","For science fiction movies (it is), then 'Arrival' is truly golden. '2001' is only on a slightly higher level because it was such a groundbreaking sci-fi film in 1968. Nothing like it ever before.
It will forever stand alone.
A true Kubrick artistic masterpiece.It is sci-fi, but truly makes you think...
think about all of the universals.
Why are we here?; life, death, trust, time, god.
What does, or could, it all mean.To those so many reviewers who found 'Arrival' 'boring', just sad.
Please stick to your CGI extravaganzas.",10,3,5,21 May 2019
The Producers," There should be another word for FUNNY!!
","There are very few movies that make me laugh out loud regularly, even after multiple viewings...this is one of them. Another is 'Young Frankenstein'. The elevator scene in 'Producers' is pure genius, but only one example of so many. Just brilliant comedy, sadly before Mr. Brooks seemingly sort of lost his touch. (i.e. 'History of the World', 'Spaceballs')
But 'Springtime for Hitler' forever!!!
This is simply one of the greats.",10,0,1,17 August 2019
