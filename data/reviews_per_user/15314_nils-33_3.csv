Minority Report," Not as good as you might have heard
","OK, it has some interesting ideas about a future society. The story is actually quite good, although there is something odd about the way it's very predictable, then there's a twist, after which you immediately know what the next surprise will be. Until the next twist that is.There are a few problems though. Both the action sequences and the (somewhat slapstick) comedy seem out of place in a movie like this. It's like a putting a Blues Brothers style car chase in Blade Runner. The ending too doesn't really fit with the rest of the film.And of course there's Tom Cruise, who, as usual, comes across as so unsympathetic it's hard to care what happens to him. And this has nothing to do with recent real life events, mind you. I didn't see Cradle Robbing Religious Lunatic Cruise on the screen, just Unpleasant Police Junkie Anderton. He can act, sure, but whether he plays a macho fighter pilot, a whining doctor or a Great White Hope Samurai, I just can't seem to root for the guy. Luckily there are some people around him to care about, unlike Tom's awful children in this years War of the Worlds.",Null,3,5,13 September 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," nice looking landscapes and girl...
","... and that's about it really. The rest is an agonisingly slow two hours of boring lovestories and swinging about on invisible ropes. Four oscars? At least a lot of people seem to hate it. Why can't they hate that other pinnacle of overratedness (is that a word?), The Matrix, a bit more?",Null,3,5,30 October 2003
The Matrix," 'overrated' is a one word summary
","Great concept of course. I had high hopes going to the cinema a few years ago, although I was slightly worried by the fact that the world's worst actor was to play the lead. The idea behind the movie sounded so promising that I was ready to set aside my prejudices and enjoy it.Well... I left the theater depressed, bored and enormously annoyed with my friends who were raving about how great this movie was. Then, I thought it was a crappy, overrated but average film, but my dislike has grown over the years because of the constant praise of people who really should know better. Now I really hate The Matrix and I do hope there are some of you out there that agree with me, although I haven't found many yet.",Null,0,1,4 April 2003
