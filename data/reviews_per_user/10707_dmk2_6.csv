Spartacus," A classic historical movie, restored
",I recently saw this again in the cinema (previously only on TV) in a restored 70mm format.  I really enjoyed seeing it in this format.At slightly over three hours in length it is not a long film to tell the story.  By modern standards some scenes may be slow but overall the pace was appropriate for the sombre story of downtrodden slaves seeking freedom from manipulating Roman overlords.The colours and cinematography are excellent.  Alas I can only imagine how it looked when first released in 1960.   The restorers have worked well but the clarity of the picture has been lost in parts of some frames.  The casting is good with all turning in good performances in their roles.Leaves the modern efforts like Gladiator looking flashy but lacking depth and scope.Given the number of times this has been shown on TV it is obviously still popular with many of the viewing public.  However if you do get the chance to see it on the big screen in 70mm it is still worth the entrance fee.,9,1,2,14 August 2001
12 Monkeys," A rare re-make - added something to the original
","Is it a re-make?  The plot is clearly based on Chris Marker's 'La Jetee' (and acknowledged in the opening credits). Terry Gilliam has taken the plot and really fleshed it out.  I saw the film at a small independent cinema in Amsterdam which was showing La Jetee and then 12 Monkeys.  Terry Gilliam has managed to make the film Chris Marker didn't have the money for. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt add the depth needed to the characters.  La Jetee is a great French film.  Generally I hate the American re-makes of successful French films. 12 Monkeys is a rare re-make, it really adds something to the original.",9,0,0,2 June 1999
Pearl Harbor," Two films in one and neither live up to expectations
","The film, while named Peal Harbor, covers two war time events.  The Japanese attack on Peal Harbour and the 'Dolittle' raids in April 42 on Japan by US bombers flown from carriers.Really the film is just a triangular romance set during the war incorporating the above events.Hollywood thoughtfully presumes, though not accurately, that pilots trained to fly fighter planes will obviously make expert bomber pilots.The effects were good and the film does address the affects on the ground during the Pearl Harbour raid more than previous depictions.Where the film really falls down is in over setting expectations.  By calling the film Peal Harbor people will judge it as such.  However the film is a romance set in a war.If you want a film on Peal Harbour you still should watch Tora! Tora! Tora! There has been nothing beter since.",5,0,0,13 August 2001
Zulu," Still awesome
","I first saw this movie in 1971 when I was 9. I thought it was just awesome. I recently saw it again. It's still awesome. There is little amongst the latest crop of great movies which are it's equal, including Schindlers list. The sheer scale of the movie, the size of the cast means that modern movie makers are unlikely ever to equal it. Excellent film making and acting. As a period film it is of course timeless. In 1999 it is just as watchable as I found it in 1971.",10,1,2,2 June 1999
Shall We Dance," Good adaption of the original Japanese version
","Since this is a remake it is difficult to comment without reference to the original. Japanese and American cultures are somewhat different, this is a good adaptation of the original Japanese film (which I enjoyed very much - I do ballroom dance too). This too was very enjoyable. The dialogue has been updated to suite the American audience and the different cultural back ground. This makes it a more accessible version to the western audience than the Japanese version; otherwise it's a reasonable remake of a lovely film. Richard Gere, Lisa Ann Walter and Jennifer Lopez turned in good performances on the dance floor, though I must admit I liked the dance scenes in the original better.",6,0,0,22 April 2005
The Breakfast Club," Has passed the test of time....
","If I had voted for this the first time I saw it I may not have given it such a high score. But I have seen it a number of times now and it continues to entertain. There is nothing exceptional about the performances by the players, or the setting. But the concept, however, it just simply appeals. Perhaps it appeals to its own generation most and so continues to appeal to them as the get older. It's about a group of white teenagers in Middle America but it still reaches to the viewer wherever they are as it addresses some of the issues all teenagers face to a greater or lesser degree. Perhaps that is why it passes the test of time. It is the sort of film which could be remade every 40 years for a new generation.",9,2,4,22 April 2005
