Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better the second time
",I saw 'The Phantom menace' twice in the same day. The first time  I expected a movie equal if not better than the original trilogy. I was disappointed.The second time around I viewed the movie as a separate entity from the original trilogy. If you view it that way then it is a great movie. Remove the 'Star Wars' tag and think of it as another sci-fi movie and 'The Phantom Menace' will live in your memory. My advice to anyone seeing the movie is to view it this way and not compare it with the other 'Star Wars' tagged movies.,8,0,0,4 June 1999
Unbreakable," Beautifully crafted and directed!
","Unfortunately, comparisons have to be made with the debut film from Shyamalan. This is a great follow up but... Plot-wise this isn't quite as intriguing as SENSE. Character-wise the way in which Willis has to come to terms with being who he is, does not compare with the horrors young Haley Joel had to face. In fact the best character in this film is Robin Wright's loyal, enduring wife. Did it need the 'twist' at the end, or was it merely expected? Both films were beautifully crafted and directed. Mixing first person perspective camera work (eg the fall into the pool) with vouyeur camera work (eg on the train). My Rating: 10/10 for direction, 6/10 for plot",8,1,1,1 December 2000
Memento," 'Don't believe his lies'
","Well, where do you begin to describe Memento. I loved the way the scenes were shown 'backwards' and forwards till they met in the middle to reveal the climax. But, even the end may not be what it seems to be. This is a true classic a masterpiece which may go unnoticed and not truly acclaimed for it's brilliance. But, I think twenty years from now 'Memento' will be a landmark film. A cult classic. (10/10)",9,0,0,6 April 2001
X-Men," X-men or the day Wolverine stole the show
","X-men would not be half as good a movie as it is without Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He portrays the character with brute anger at times, along with a little sensitivity as well. Also, Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor X, no-one in the world is perfectly suited for the role.I wished the movie wouldn't end that's how enthralling the experience was for me.",9,0,0,13 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Finale worth the wait!
","It takes it's time to warm up - Attack of the clones - but the last 30 minutes of so is worth the wait, the 3 year wait, that is.The only other worthy mention which many people have ignored is Hayden Christiansen's brooding Anakin - watch the way he mimmicks Darth Vader's gait and mannerisms. Unfortunately, the plot is confusing, the acting is amateur, and the digital monsters disappointing, but... The Clonetroopers were cool!! My rating: 9/10 for the final 30 minutes and forget the rest...",5,0,0,16 May 2002
Notting Hill," It's Good, not your typical romantic comedy!
","Notting Hill packs some surprises. The lead (Hugh Grant) goes through a lot of turmoil to finally, get the girl (Julia Roberts). On one hand, I liked the way his character, William, acted toward, Anna Scott. He didn't go all gooey over her star status. I thought is was good at first. But, when he finally realises that she likes to be with him, he doesn't go out of his way to keep her.There isn't a whole lot of chemistry going on between the two of them either. It's like 'Okay, let's have dinner. Or Okay let's jump this fence.' Not much passion there.The supporting cast is great, I especially like Bella, William's wheelchair bound ex-lover. His welsh flatmate was at times too far-fetched. (Jar Jar-esque)Overall it was a good movie, with character and plot something that's missing in most films these days!",7,0,0,23 June 1999
Pearl Harbor," Bang, Bang, kiss, kiss
","Do You want to hear the worst, cliched dialogue ever in the history of film? go and see Pearl Harbor for 3+ hours of dribble. Do you want to see a 35 minute commercial for the integration of CGI and real life action? go and see the second hour of Pearl Harbor. Do you have a spare three hours to WASTE? go and see Pearl Harbor. Do you want to see a beautiful woman? go and see Kate Beckinsale in Pearl Harbor. Have you got a life? Then you wouldn't even consider seeing Pearl Harbor. Final verdict: 2/10",2,0,0,21 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Chemistry NOT action
","This movie would have been a complete failure without one thing- that is, the chemistry between Ethan (Cruise) and Nyah (Newton).the rest of the movie is just unrealistic fill without their unique interaction.",Null,0,0,13 July 2000
A Clockwork Orange," True Horrorshow!
","I've been waiting for this movie to come out on video for years. I was banned on video in my state. I'd heard a lot about this film. I wasn't disappointed. I am in awe of Malcolm McDowell's performance as Alex De Lage. His performance deserved more than an oscar, if there's such a thing.    Almost thirty years on, 'A clockwork orange' looks far from dated. You could be tricked into thinking it was made this year. The soundtrack is outstanding, Beethoven never sounded so good. Kubrick's applies his trademark direction using first-person perspective and wide/varied angles to perfection. Anyway, I could go on and on about this film. Just see it if you haven't and viddy it again and again. RATING: 10/10",9,1,2,11 November 2000
Titanic," Why did it succeed?
","Four years and many notable awards (including Best Picture Oscar) after, and the all-time box office number one position, why did Titanic succeed?Personally, it was magical. The recreated ship, the sinking, the digital effects, were all a beautiful backdrop to one thing - the love story. The love story was the fantastic notion that love has no limits, love crossed class barriers and it won our hearts in the end.Even if 'true' love like this doesn't really exist, it's nice to think that for three hours, here, at least it does.",9,2,3,11 August 2001
Before Sunrise," Who needs Special Effects, when a movie like this exists?
","Simple, Original, and Romantic. 'Before Sunrise' is about Chemistry. The casting of the two lead actors: Hawke, and Delpy was a master stroke. Sure, at times it looks like they are just saying their lines, but most times their reactions to each other are spontaneous. The scene in the listening booth, conveys so much while saying so little. The magical first meeting was also majestic, as two strangers meet as if they'd known each other for their whole lives. The scene in which they pretend to talk to their friend over the phone describing their meeting of each other, is a fascinating way of telling one another, how they feel.It'd be nice just once in life to have an encounter like the one depicted in this movie. The setting is also very romantic and adds to the genuine 'magic' of the film. The conversation is interesting and not overwhelming. Most of all the pleasantness conveyed by both lead characters makes you wish for more. (Rating: 9.5/10)",9,1,3,13 October 2000
The Sixth Sense," An intriguing movie
","I don't understand the critics reviews for this movie. I thought the plot was constructed well, and the characters were also developed well. I thought the acting was superb too, Cole was portrayed brilliantly, and Bruce Willis's - Dr. Crowe, was also great. The support cast were good too.It has taken a couple of months for this film to reach Australia. So, I've watched its progress at the US Box Office over the net, and I've read the poor reviews as well. So, I can't explain why it did so well ($220+ million) at the Box Office because it isn't really a mainstream cinema-goers movie. On the other hand, I thought the critics would love it, but they definitely did not embrace it. So, the IMDB voters poll is, in my opinion the only true poll for this movie at 8.8 avg. I thought it was great!!",Null,0,0,7 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best of The Trilogy
","The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes 4-6).  The characterization is exceptional, we've all come to love and hate, Luke and Vader. The twist at the end was widely talked about during its release.",9,0,1,6 April 1999
Gladiator," When in Rome...
","This film reaches some fantastic heights here are my personal highlights:1. When Maximus(Russell Crowe) reveals himself to Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix) after his first victory in the colosseum. 2. The battle in the colosseum: Maximus versus the undefeated gladiator and the lions.3. The final duel in the colosseum. This was not a long duel, and was represented realistically. An untrained Emperor versus a highly experienced wounded Maximus.4. ...and any other battle scene in between.Gladiator looks good, sounds good, and really lifts you, that is you want to be Maximus and avenge the wrongs which have been dealt upon you. A classic good versus evil story.",9,0,0,8 May 2000
