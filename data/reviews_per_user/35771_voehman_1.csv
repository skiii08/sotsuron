Men in Black 3," I did not see this coming
","I sort of liked the first two movies. I was so young at the time and now I was just starving for some sci-fi and found out that this one had a rather good rating for being a comedy/sci-fi movie. I decided to check it out and I'm glad I did. This movie is really funny, has an interesting plot and just doesn't really fall too far into clichés. It's Hollywood all right but this one has a way of staying interesting without having to resort to stupid cliché moments or stretched out fight scenes. I loved fight scenes when I was a kid but maaan have I had enough... This one does it the perfect amount of time. To summarize: This movie has the things you expect, but it does most of it better than you'd expect. I was taken aback and my low expectations really payed off and then some. Well worth a watch if you need to get away from the heavy drama shows we have around us now all the time.",9,1,3,31 July 2014
