The Avengers," Amazing movie!
","I have to give it 10/10 as from start to finish I was engrossed in this film at the cinema and have watch it many times since its release on blu ray. Great super hero movie and all the characters have enough screen time, and no one hero takes over the film. The graphics are exceptional and in 3D was truly brilliant.The one character I though might look a bit ropey was the Hulk as in other films he has never looked right, but here I would have to say he was probably my favorite character, player very well by Mark Ruffalo.If you love this kind of film then you won't be disappointed. Sit back with the popcorn and enjoy.",10,1,5,12 October 2012
Prometheus," Great visual but film doesn't grab you.
","Ridley Scott can definitely provide a film with great visuals. Everything in terms of costumes, sets, cgi etc is exceptional but that doesn't disguise the fact the film just does not get you to care for the story or the characters.His previous Alien film had you on the edge of your seat and cared for every single character in the movie...terrifying film.Prometheus though just has you feeling a bit empty at the end of the film and its just OK. The characters don't engage you, and you're not bothered what happens to them. Plot holes a plenty but I won't spoil it. You will want to watch it if you are a fan but I doubt it be one of those films that you will watch again and again...it will be forgotten quickly.I think the film suffered from all the pre-hype it had before release and expectations were probably too high.",6,0,1,12 October 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Great film that got better after a second viewing
","When I first watched this film I wasn't impressed with it, but after watching a few times more the film has really grown on me. Great action scenes as always and at least in this film you know what robots are who in the fight sequences.Some of the battle scenes are mind blowing especially when viewed on blu ray. Much better story which makes this film stand along the first one very well.Much better than the second film and improved with taking out the comedy aspect of which the second film had too much in. Give it a go, great popcorn movie.",8,10,14,12 October 2012
