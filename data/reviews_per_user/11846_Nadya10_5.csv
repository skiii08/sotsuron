",i thought at first i was not going to like it but then my parents made me see it... i first thought that i was not going to like it because i do not kinda like things like this movie.. then when colin firth came on.. I said to my self why don't i give this a shot and see if i like it you know.

Argo," the best movie of 2012!
",I went in there to see it.. i didn't know what to expect.. But after i saw it i thought it was the best movie i have seen this year. I thought Ben Afleck played a great role. I totally want to see it again. I told my mom and people that i know to see it. I loved Bryan Crangston in this he played the best part. John goodman played a interesting part. I loved seeing how the people looked when it really happened. I want to see it again to understand it better. I totally see it being a best picture nominee and best director if it doesn't i will totally be so shocked. It beserves a lot of notations. I give it 10 stars its the best Ben Afleck movie. I hope everyone goes out and loves it as much as i do.,10,1,4,16 October 2012

Man of Steel," the best superman movie ever.
",If u haven't seen it I highly recommend people to see this. I say its the best one i have seen. Henry Cavil totally is the best superman ever. I cant wait to see the sequel. I thought at first Amy Adams wouldn't find out who he was till the 3rd one but she did. It was totally different then the other ones. I did like the director and how he did it. I can totally see another one. I thought Russell Cr owe did a great job playing superman's father. I loved Lawrence Fish burg in it. I give it 4 stars. I now want to see it one more time to see it in 3D. I loved the whole movie.I loved seeing scenes that looked like NYC. I loved seeing all the planets and the sky what it looked like.,10,2,7,18 June 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," the best harry potter movie ever
",I though to tell you the truth i though i wouldn't like it... But that changed when i saw the first fifteen minutes of it.. I can't wait to see the second part of it... I loved All the characters and who played them.. I loved wherever it was filmed.. Harry is always the best person in it and his family can sometimes be mean.. I think Hermoine is the best person for the characters because she has a good sense of humor.. I loved Ron and his brothers and how they grew up a lot from the other harry potters.. i like Rons parents a lot and how they are smart and nice to their children.. Dobby is one of the best and awesome elf. I like helen Carter and the person she played she played a good part. Daniel Ratcliff is always the best at harry potter and the way he plays harry potter is always good. I want to see it on DVD to see the special effects to see how they made Voldermort.. I am definitely going to see the second part.. Just to see it and see if its as good as the one i just saw.,10,1,2,30 November 2010
