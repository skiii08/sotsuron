Sucker Punch," The suckers were the audience!
","I saw this movie 3 days after 'Battle Los Angeles' as I was in the mood for another one of those big bang action movies to wind down after a hard day at the office.Big mistake.While I was entertained by the former, I felt absolutely drained physically and mentally when the movie ended. The characters in this movie sucked on all levels. The director wanted to replicate the feel of '300' but failed on a epic scale because things moved in such a haphazard manner, nothing connected with me.Save your money.",3,13,27,29 March 2011
Argo," Sometimes the bad ideas do really work.....
","This is by far one of the most impressive movies of 2012. There was a lot of attention to detail, right down to the opening frame, where you'll see the Warners Bros logo circa 1970's, befitting the era which the movie was set.Let's start with the basics. Argo is set in Iran during the tumultuous year 1979, a time when the US embassy in Tehran was stormed and seized by a mob of lunatic Iranian yobs. By sheer fate (of being in a separate part of the embassy), 6 American staff members managed to sneak out and became refugees in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Enter Tony Mendez (played brilliantly by Ben Affleck) of the CIA, whose job description includes 'extracting' Americans out of hazardous environment.The first half of the film devotes to building the premise of this ridiculously far-fetched idea of using a science fiction movie as the narrative of the entire escape plan. With dwindling options available and a rapidly deteriorating situation, the US government had no choice but to go along with this, thus proving once again that sometimes, the bad ideas do really work.The second half quickens the pace when Mendez meets the 6 Americans for the first time and has to do a quick job of trying to convince them of the plan, and getting them to act and play their role as part of a film crew. Although Mendez's plan was stopped by the authorities, he proceeds anyway. The tension really hits the roof at the airport when this desperate group are but steps away from freedom. The editing work was very well done, and you'll feel your stomach going to knots. It's only when the plane announced they were safely on their way to Zurich that you can finally let go. I would imagine that was how the 6 Americans felt at that time.Overall, this was an extremely satisfying movie. The look and feel of the movie felt authentic, right down to the deliberate decision to make the entire movie grainy and 70s. I would be extremely disappointed if Argo did not get a mention in the Academy Awards.",10,3,7,16 November 2012
Aquaman," 'I am....Aquaman'
","Seems like DC and WB has got a winner here. This is by far the best comic book movie DC/WB has come out with, even better than Wonder Woman. The story doesn't meander too much, and everything stays on point. All the flashbacks are done with great effectiveness, especially when Aquaman speaks to the big bad ass Kraken guarding the trident of all tridents. And how could you miss with a unbelievable supporting cast comprising Dolph Lundgren , Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe. Also, I didn't know the Kraken's voice belonged to, of all people, Mary Poppins herself, Julie Andrews. The visuals were amazing, but did not overload the senses, unlike Batman v Superman or Justice League. I hope the people at DC/WB now realise you can't replace good storytelling (and good acting) with outrageous and overwhelming special effects. It doesn't work that way. It was indeed appropriate that our hero announced his arrival in our superhero consciousness with a commanding tone at the end of the show with 'I am....Aquaman'.p/s With all this momentum going for Aquaman, Wonder Woman 1984 has a lot to live up to. Hope it does make it.",10,1,2,22 December 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," A madcap swashbuckling adventure
","First off, I must say what a pleasure it must been for me personally to see this fantastic film ahead of the United States. Usually the traffic is one way from that direction to the rest of the world.But enough of that.What an adventure! As someone who grew up reading the world of Tintin, I must admit I had serious concerns how anyone can pull this off without alienating the fan-base. How wrong I was! In the capable hands of Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, this dynamic duo has managed, against all odds, to bring the spirit, character and that 'X' factor of Tintin from print to screen so seamlessly.And the 3D, my word, the technology is brilliant. Forget the fear of leaving the cinema with a headache because the visuals were crisp and out of this world. At times, you'll really believe you are watching a real person rather than an imaginary one. The script was well written so it does not matter if you do not follow the series or know the characters because as the film progresses, you will slowly learn of them.Finally, the success or failure of any animation depends on the voices behind the various characters. Amongst this talent pool of voices, the absolute standout performance for me must be Daniel Craig. He delivered the correct level of charm and menace in his vocal delivery as the chief villain. It was as if he studied all the villains from the Bond archive and reproduced it here. An excellent performance indeed.So I am awarding this film full marks.",9,0,3,13 November 2011
Bohemian Rhapsody," Touched my heart
","The critics got it all wrong with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' when the song came out, and this time, the critics got it wrong again with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' the movie. Make no mistake, this is a movie made for everyone to enjoy and appreciate, just like how Queen ensured their music touched the nerves of their audience.The tone was set at the movie's very first frame, when a rock guitar version of the 20th Century Fox fanfare came on, aptly tying the subject to the presentation. The last great movie which tied the movie to the fanfare was 'Argo', and look what happened to that movie. A good omen, I hope.This movie touched my heart more than any other that I've seen. The music was mesmerizing, and was adroitly and intricately woven into each sequence, each act and carried each arc of the movie, right up to its climatic conclusion : the band's epic Live Aid performance. It will give you goosebumps, I assure you.
And make you cry, which I did.Credit must be given to the entire production team for making this movie so believable. The cast were so good that after a while, you forget you were watching actors but rather felt like you were the fly-on-wall seeing these events happen right in front of you. I must also congratulate lead actor Rami Malek for taking in every essence of Freddie Mercury, and replicating it on the big screen with total perfection. He was not Rami, he was Freddie. Thank goodness Sacha Baron Cohen was not cast here, and Freddie Mercury would have turned out very differently, given what we know about Cohen's acting credibility (or lack of).Finally, it'll be good for viewers to accept some creative licence undertaken by the filmakers. Gosh, if you want to see a factual depiction, go watch a documentary!",10,6,9,3 November 2018
Kung Fu Panda 2," A visual spectacular far surpassing the original!
","Well, what can I say about KP2? It's a feast for the senses! The team behind the movie has taken great pains on the finer details of every character and every single pixel, ensuring the audience is enthralled for the entire movie. Well done to them! The story this time strikes a much resonant and emotional chord, and my kids sobbed when they saw the scene of Po's forced abandonment by his mother in order to save his life. And in the reunion of adopted father and son in the final scene pulls the heartstrings till no end. There's also a big hint of a KP3 just before the show ends.This is an excellent follow-up to the original, and exceeds every level.",9,5,12,28 May 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," I expected more action.....
","I went into the cinema hall with great expectations with the latest Spiderman. Not really a huge comic book fan, but from time to time, I have been keeping up to date with the various teaser trailers, and know enough to keep me wanting to see it.I did, and, to be honest, I was slightly disappointed by the lack of action. Don't get me wrong. By itself, this movie is great, visually, as well as story-wise. However, with the last Spiderman done just 5 years ago, one can't help but make comparisons between this movie and its predecessors. And this is where the movie falls short. I expected really more bone crunching action from this Spiderman. After all, the villain is another wall crawler with amazing powers of recovery, ie, he can't be hurt! Rather than having an intense action sequence, the director chose to have action interspersed throughout the movie in bits.But, despite my little gripe, this is a spectacular movie. The star of the show is Rhys Ifans, who gave a 101% performance, balancing between the rational and the maniacal. This is great acting, and you can't learn it.",7,0,2,14 July 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Tom Cruise is back, and it's good to be back.......
","If ever there was a film for an actor to resurrect his flagging career, this would be IT. This film has action written all over, and the tension never lets up from the first moment. The viewer will first be transported from cold Eastern Europe, to the magnificent Middle East, and then exotic South Asia, all within the space of just over 2 hours. I would compare this film to be like a roller coaster ride, where you are slowly ascending up the ramp (building the plot) which is then followed by a dramatic breath-taking drop (the supremely spine chilling climb scene outside Dubai's Burj Khalifa...mind blowing), then a couple of twists and turns (the policy wonk who knows more than writing papers), all of which climaxes in a double overhead loop (the end scene at a high tech car park) and finally, the relief at the end of everything. The wonderful thing about rollercoasters is that after the ride, you'll want another round to feel the adrenaline again. This is how it feels like when you finish watching it. You want to see it again. After a summer of fighting robots, talking cars, it is great that 2011 ends the film going year with what I consider a classic thriller.",10,3,7,23 December 2011
Ice Age: Continental Drift," This is how to spend time with your family!
","The latest installment of the 'Ice Age' story is probably one of the best in the series from a visual experience point of view. Even when watching the 2D version, you'll find yourself voluntarily pulled along by the great action sequence. The main story arc is, of course, family. Manny the Mammoth has to deal with issues with his teenage daughter, Deigo, the Sabre Tooth, has to deal with settling down with someone, and Sid the Sloth, has to deal with his cantankerous grandmother, who incidentally, isn't that really cuckoo or loopy as we think! The villains here are an absolute hilarious bunch of societal misfits. The funniest of them all must be the elephant seal. In the final scene where the animals find a new home, look out for a Statue of Liberty at the entrance of the harbour. This conjures up similarities of how the new immigrants must have felt when they sailed to America in the beginning of the last century as their respective homelands were torn apart. It's quite powerful stuff. And of course, if you were wondering how America got its deserts despite having one of most fertile places in the world, its all because of an acorn :)",9,0,1,14 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A great movie experience but....
","Star Wars Episode 3 is certainly well worth the money spent on the tickets. The special effects were out of this world! During the opening scene of the fight in space, a fighter was blown to bits and you can actually SEE the pilot being thrown into orbit together with the rest of the debris. If that effect does not meet expectations, I don't quite know how else anyone can make it better. The light saber duels were excellent. However, the Obiwan-Grievious fight scene was a huge disappointment. I mean, how can someone (or something) known as the ruthless killer of other Jedi warriors, and wielding FOUR light sabers, be so incompetent to lose 2 arms in a space of seconds?Unfortunately, I have to admit that what brought this movie down a few points was the hurried pace during that all important scene where Anakin became Darth Vader. The scene was perfect to extract the maximum dramatic emotion from the audience, but it felt as if Lucas was running out of film and needed to finish the shoot in double quick time. All in all, Episode 3 is the best of the prequels but some way short of the spirit of the original.",7,5,9,23 May 2005
X-Men: First Class," The Cold War according to Marvel
","This is creative movie making at its most extreme. By transplanting the X-men mythology into an actual historical event, ie, the Cuban Missile Crisis, you have to suspend disbelief entirely for the duration of the movie.That being said, on its own, this movie does sufficient justice as a background piece to the X-men series for non-followers. We now realise just how deep and how broad the affection is between the Professor and Magneto. We also we understand the extremist behaviour of Magneto, the misunderstood villain. I mean, it's not easy to forgive when someone pumps hundreds of missiles at you to ensure your demise! Overall, it's an OK movie to spend your money on.",7,0,4,26 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A fitting end to a long saga
","There were a more than a few sighs in the cinema audience when the final scene ended with the fade out of the 3 protagonists (who IMO didn't age 19 years at all) as their children departed for Hogwarts. Most of these sighs came from the slightly younger people in the audience, the Gen Y and Gen Z. I know how it feels. I grew up with Star Wars and I got that same feeling when the saga concluded with 'Revenge of the Sith'. It's that feeling of emptiness that there is nothing else to look forward to now.The final installment of the Harry Potter story is everything the viewer wants, and more. The performances of all actors, even those in supporting roles, were excellent. While it was natural that the younger stars got most of the attention, to me, the outstanding performances came from the older ones, like Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, David Thewlis and Jason Isacs.I was completely fascinated by Alan Rickman's Severus Snape. His back story, done in a flashback, was the fulcrum to which the entire series rests upon. Alan Rickman played the part of a misunderstood hero to absolute perfection. From the flashback, you can see his complete devotion to his childhood friend, Lily, and how he loved her so much that he was willing to sacrifice his good name and reputation to protect her legacy, ie, Harry Potter. Watch out for the scene when he uttered 'you have your mother's eyes' before dying. It would make your viewing of Snape's memories that much more poignant. Unfortunately, that flashback was hastily done, and it does not give justice to Snape's dislike of James Potter. But I suppose for that to happen, the running time would have to be extended by another 30 mins. Alan Rickman owned Snape, and Snape owned Harry Potter.The other standout performance was none other than Ralph Fiennes' Voldermort. He reminded me of that sadistic Nazi camp commander in 'Schinder's List', a role which he excelled. You'll feel a chill in your spine even when all he needs to do is stare at you from the screen. A little girl about 6 who was sitting in the row in front of me grabbed her mother for dear life when he did this. Yes, he was that good.Finally, you will understand the reason for the inter-twining of the destinies of Harry and Voldermort, which happened on the night James and Lily were killed.All in, this is a fitting and well deserved conclusion to a saga which needed a full 10 years to unfold.",Null,1,2,15 July 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," This is what I call entertainment!!
","Just came back from the cinema watching the latest Transformers, and I will say this : This installment of the series is entertainment at its best! Note that I use the word 'entertainment' and not story telling because this film is what it is and makes no apologies about it. Critics and others who savage this film are obviously stuck in their ivory tower and unable to differentiate just what summer film audience wants. You do not go to a cinema in the middle of summer expecting a dose of Chauncer, Shakespeare or Hemingway! Yes, there are holes in the story the size of elephants, but so what? You want to be entertained. End of.So here's my review.As a lay follower of the Transformers story, I am somewhat familiar with the lead characters, and I have to say that although the movie takes creative license to the max, the end result is a satisfying 2 hrs of solid entertainment. You have it all : a revisionist view of the lunar mission, treachery by a senior ranking Autobot in Sentinel Prime, moments of comedy, a gorgeous woman, and eye popping special effects that will leave you breathless to the very last minute. The final hour is a fantastic convergence of the story where Chicago is pulverised to smithereens, and yes, this time unlike the previous two installments, innocent civilians can be seen vapourised on screen. The producers have also obviously realised that the audience wants to see a more detailed, ie, slower, transformation of Autobots and Decepticons from their robot mode to their alternate mode, and the special effects team have done that splendidly! You will be amazed.However, despite this, I could not give this a full score because I am left with a certain level of disappointment. The relatively cheap and undignified deaths of Starscream, Megatron and Shockwave was totally unexpected. You would think that a major character like Starscream deserve a more glorified death than being hit in the eye by Sam's weapon. I could not believe these high tech villains could be undermined by really low tech solutions.That said, this is a fantastic piece of entertainment which will make your summer that much more memorable.",8,1,4,2 July 2011
