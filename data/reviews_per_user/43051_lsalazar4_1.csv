Ali," Don't you get it?
","Many people don't seem to understand, but this movie is not about Ali's achievements as a pugilist, but rather him being thrust into the role of civil rights activist. He was friends with Malcolm X, who's popularity soared at the time...Martin Luther King was also near his peak as an activist. These 3 individuals had an enormous influence on the Afro-American civil rights movement at the time, and the post-segregation, white dominated government were very afraid of what would happen if these 3 personalities would have exercised their influence one way or another to oppressive actions of the times. The scene with Ali in Africa demonstrated to him that he was not just a boxer, he was hope to those that had none.",9,0,1,14 February 2004
