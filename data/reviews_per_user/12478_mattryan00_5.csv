Catch Me If You Can," Captures the Imagination
","This was definitely a fun one. I saw this one Christmas day with the family and was very much impressed. It's fun to see Hanks as a flawed character, and his performance (along with Leo's) was just awesome.There were some laughs to go along with the drama, but most of all, Frank's (Leo) actions served to capture the imagination. His many 'Zach Morris moments' make this film a real treat to watch. I don't say this often, but this film is probably worth your $6-10---depending on how much your local theater gouges you. I gave it a 10 ;o)",10,2,3,25 December 2002
The Girl Next Door," Oh Elisha Cuthbert...your pouty looks make my heart melt
","Elisha Cuthbert. What more can I say? This cute little sex-kitten is the best thing to come out of Canada since Brian Adams. As for this film? It was good enough for me to take the time to comment on, so that is certainly saying something.The Girl Next Door goes against a couple of long standing norms in that it is: A)	A creative, engaging coming-of-age flick B)	A classy film about pornGranted, Elisha Cuthbert could stand in front of a camera making pouty lip-faces and giggle that cute little laugh of hers for 75 minutes and the film could gross 75 million, but this movie just inexplicably `did it' for me, no pun intended...the plot was able to stand on its own.The imagination that this film inspires: the notion that a moment of serendipity can await an unsuspecting, worthy person is what really inspired me. This movie also managed to avoid the majority of the teen romance clichés, which is certainly a good thing. I gave this one an unequivocal 10 rating: Not only did Elisha Cuthbert make this film great, but the plot was quite impressive too, as I certainly wasn't expecting much. 
And the best part about this movie? Freddie Prinze Jr. wasn't in it. Instead, some kid who looks like he belongs in a Harry Potter movie got some actiononly in the movies ;o)",10,0,0,26 July 2004
The Italian Job," Formulaic
","I went in with high expectations on this one, and found myself chortling (not laughing mind you, chortling) a few times; let's just say the dialogue left something to be desired. It just got to the point that I was trying really hard to like this one, given the awesome ensemble cast and what I thought we be a solid plot line.Alas, this one was as predictable as could be. The only things that were more disturbing than the plot line were the SHAMELESS commercial tie-ins. I mean really. It's fine to tie-in products; I'm not against the concept. But the Italian Job really lacked the subtlety required, as the ads just took away from any of this movie's respectability.When this film ended I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. And do you know what could get rid of that bad taste? You guessed it! A cool, refreshing Pepsi Blue. I'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything, but since the Mini Cooper was such a central part of this movie, do you think that BMW had a hand in the script? Duh-Dum-Dah-Da!",6,1,2,23 June 2003
Dirty Dancing," Closed minds come in many forms
","I have seen well over a thousand movies to date, yet I never gave Dirty Dancing a chance. It's a 'click flick,' right? On a quiet Sunday morning I watched this film and I'm really glad I did. It's a really great, inspiring firm that holds up well to time - 20 years later I found everything to be very compelling and pertinent.First of all, Jerry Orbach kicks ass. That just needed to be said. Jennifer Grey does a solid job, but Swayze carries the day. This character-driven plot line is relatable and wholly interesting. All in all, I found myself thoroughly engaged.Finally, it even prompted a bit of introspection - if I'm so reticent to dance, what makes me any different from the obstinate, prudish old man? I'll close with this line, one of the real 80's classics: 'Nobody puts Baby in the corner.' For what this film is: 10/10",10,0,0,29 July 2007
Garden State," The best movie I have seen this year
","I can't get over how much I liked this movie. For one, I'm a total idiot. I swear, if Natalie Portman farted I would probably say that it smelled of roses. What can I say? She has this amazing charm to her that I find absolutely endearing. Every time she laughed that sweet goofy laugh of hers, I couldn't help but form a goofy laugh of my own.I love good, intelligent, dark comedy...and that's what this was all the way. There were some great moments in this one..and the best were the random, off-the-wall ones that caught you out of left field.I really enjoyed this film. Finally, something new instead of the same recycled schlock. Granted, it's still a boy-meets-girl, falls in love, etc film...but it was done creatively and in such a manner that it engrossed you in the plot, and you can't ask for anything else out of a film.I would go see this one again in the theater, and that's REALLY saying something for me. 10/10 Baby.",10,0,1,3 September 2004
