The Rock," One of the best action movies I have ever seen...
","Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor of all time and this is his best action movie he has ever done..great cinemetography and setting as well as great characters. Sean Connery is also brilliant, as well as a strong supporting role for Ed Harris, who is alos another great actor. Highly recommended and if you haven't seen it, run to the video store!!",9,1,1,10 October 1998

Pulp Fiction," You either love this movie or hate it...
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I loved the characters, story and writing. Quentin Tarantino is a brilliant filmmaker. I am only one of three people that I know that actually liked this movie and I love that I have my own opinion about it. People have been so harsh to this movie because they don't like that a filmmaker came out of nowhere to make a film that actually wasn't afraid to say it like it is. I recommend it to everybody but not everybody will like it...Bravo to Tarantino, Thurman, Travolta and Jackson!!!",Null,0,0,29 October 1998
Jackie Brown," Good underrated film...
","I thought that this movie was going to be like Pulp Fiction but I was surprised at how good it was. It moves at a much more stable pace than Pulp but is still entertaining and good to keep up with. Pam Grier was great, as was Robert Forester. Jackson was awesome as usual...I loved the flirtation between Grier and Forester. I thought that she didn't care about him, but she did and the other characters were great. Good film to follow Pulp.",Null,0,0,29 October 1998
The Wedding Singer," NO Happy Gilmore, but still great!
","I have always liked Adam Sandler, and I fell in love with the part he played in this movie! Drew Baryrmore was wonderful as always, and the 80's theme was cute. A cute love story, with great characters. Highly recommended, great nostalgic fun....",Null,0,1,13 September 1998
