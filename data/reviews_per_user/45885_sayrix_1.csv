Black Swan," Not predictable movie
","In general, I rate movie average. Every scenes were unpredictable. Sometimes, it seems there are logical disconnections, but difficult to see it. For example, at the beginning you may think movie is about some kind of sexual acts, but not. I don't know why they added this point into the movie if they are not going show any results about these.Everybody played their roles very well. Sometimes, the film seemed naughty, in result, I thought may be I should stop wasting my time and start watching another movie. Although, the film did not meet my expectations, but still i consider the film average.",4,3,5,24 January 2011
