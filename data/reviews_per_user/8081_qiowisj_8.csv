Come and See," Florya's horrific odyssey
","Soviet cinema is unique for creating some of the most true to life World War II films in the world. Considering the Soviet form of government, this is surprising. Come and See, however, opines to avoid the bombastic battle scenes of most war movies and instead chooses a more ethereal reflection to depict the Second World War as none of us have ever seen before.The film follows Florya, an adolescent and naive partisan trying to do his part in the fight against the German onslaught. But, seen as too young to offer substantial aid, the grizzled veterans decide to leave him to watch the camp. What occurs over the next 146 minutes is not unlike what occurs in Homer's fable. He roams the countryside, meets those of his age and older and tries to endure in this hellish inferno. By the end, Florya is not the same boy he and the audience sees at the beginning. The message is direct; there are seldom any heroes in war, just death and survival.Almost immediately, one will notice the uncommon cinematography utilized throughout the movie. Steadicam shots are in ample supply here and are normally not this well done. A verbal plot is nearly non-existent, the images alone carry most of the film's weight. And while Florya, acted by Aleksei Kravchenko, was in his mid-teens at the time, his realism and emotion are beyond his years.One of the best, if not the best, war movies I've ever seen.",10,4,7,17 November 2006
Oldboy," Artistic violence
","OLDBOY is a movie that comes around perhaps only every several years. The second installment of the 'Vengeance Trilogy' following the well done Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, the result is a supreme advancement over the previous effort. Visually, it will leave you floored. Personally, it will leave you devastated. Based on interviews I've seen of Chanwook Park, this was his intention; to create a film mentally, physically and emotionally exhausting. I can honestly say he achieved this on all levels and then some by making something richly philosophical.Min-sik Choi gives the performance of the year and potentially his career. As Oh Dae-su, he undergoes a transformation of at least three different personas, performed almost all of his own stunts and otherwise poured his heart into the movie.Forget the naysayers, OLDBOY constitutes what original cinema means. Well deserving of its place on the IMDb Top 250.",10,5,59,13 November 2006
Crash," Melodramatic morality play
","The only thing I got out of Crash was about 2 hours of it screaming at me; 'EVERYONE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE RACIST!' Yes? I already knew that. Anything else? Though this is a commendable effort to force us to examine our own views toward others, there should be more to a film than that singular message. Especially when there are so many unrealistic plot twists involving so few people in such a sprawling metropolis. I find it hard to believe the same two policemen would repeatedly run into the same two people and have life altering experiences. It boggles the mind as to why heaps of praise were laid onto this film. Best Picture of 2005? I don't think so.",4,22,37,4 January 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Monstrous humanity
","Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliantly executed parable about how our own sadism projects itself historically, but through a child's eyes. From the outset the audience is left to decide whether the young protagonist is actually seeing what we are seeing. Could she be talking to a magical faun? Is her life in danger from an infanticidal ogre? Possibly; creatures whose vulgarity and wonder appear tame compared to the adult chaos surrounding her. In the end, it is the maturity near the main character which causes the most pain and suffering.Technically, I've rarely witnessed such imaginative scenery and make-up effects in a single film. The film was deservedly awarded its Oscars for art direction and costuming.Watch this movie for what it is; an all too real fairy tale.",10,4,10,24 June 2007
Barry Lyndon," Arguably the best period piece of all time
","Barry Lyndon is a film that covers a wide range of dramatic subjects which near the edge of melodrama, but skillfully never steps over. Ambition, love, tragedy, hatred, courage, power, lust; I could go on and on. True, other films have depicted these topics in 18th century Europe, many obviously done so very well. However, this is a Kubrick picture and he has brought all his talent to the forefront here. Each frame, as usual, is visually arresting, photographed as if it were a painting of that era with actual motion. The story never meanders, despite the fact that the movie relates a large portion of a man's life and career. The acting, though low key in comparison to the lush surroundings, nonetheless achieves the aim of each actor. The final scene with Lyndon's son in particular is heartbreaking. Kubrick's choice of music, both original and borrowed, fits perfectly into key segments and generally heightens the mood.Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's best in my opinion, a work of art that transcends decades.",10,3,6,28 February 2007
Children of Men," Our dystopian present?
","Birth rates have dropped dramatically, terrorism is a constant phenomenon, the government's increasingly totalitarian, immigration laws are non-existent and urban warfare presents itself on a daily basis. I'm not commenting on contemporary issues, I'm discussing the futuristic drama Children of Men, a film that threw all of these topics at my face and forced me to reexamine the world of today.I can't mention this movie without relating director Alphonso Cuaron's technical prowess of the cinematic medium. Children of Men is full of brilliant single tracking shots that left me sometimes dumbfounded as to how it was accomplished. One impressive scene in particular involved a reverse car chase involving two motorcyclists shooting at a car's occupants. The camera stays in the interior of the car at all times, not cutting away, from the casual conversation to the incident of attack to the scene's end. There are at least two other scenes similar to the one I've described.The acting is consistently good all around. Julianne Moore, Michael Cane and the rest of the supporting cast put in believable portrayals in no small part to Cuaron's excellent direction. Special credit must go to Clive Owen, the star of the film. This movie would have sunk if his performance was less than adequate. Owen manages to burden this responsibility and is able to carry the film to its bittersweet conclusion.One of the best movies of the year, Children of Men is an excellent metaphor about humanity's possible slow strangulation of itself.",10,1,4,6 January 2007
The Descent," Horror done right; original and engrossing
","Well versed moviegoers, horror fans especially, nowadays realize that there have been no end to remakes lately. The Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Grudge, et cetera, et cetera. We can look forward to upcoming films like The Hitcher being remade also. The Descent, thank god, is not like any of these.An awful car accident has left the story's protagonist, Sarah, without a daughter. A year later, she travels with a group of her girlfriends to go spelunking in America as part of an annual exercising vacation. Upon entering a vast cavern, their vacation soon becomes about surviving what they've stepped into.Revealing anymore would rid the viewer of the jolts and suspense in store. Once the scares begin, it seldom lets up. I commend director Neil Marshall for taking such a basic environment and amping up the fright factor. We've all been scared of the dark at one point, The Descent takes that primordial fear and stretches it into over an hour and a half.The choice of an all female cast was, in hindsight, fresh and respectable. Too many times have I seen mostly male characters face extreme cinematic conditions. The fact that the actresses are unknowns is further proof to excellent casting. You will worry and fret over misfortune which occurs, I've seldom experienced this in some time. Anyone can die in this film, having a huge star would've simply killed the unpredictability.A few words of advice; watch the movie with its original ending and avoid the American-released conclusion. Without it, The Descent loses some of its visceral impact, which is a shame.",9,2,5,29 December 2006
The Da Vinci Code," No Mona Lisa
","After all the hoopla given the subject matter, calls for censorship by opposing parties and buildup to its release in general, what we are presented with is a poor effort at film-making which is insulting to the audience's intelligence. I'll spare the plot outlines since practically everyone and their mother has read the book. Personally, I did not read Dan Brown's novel, but I was familiar with the theories presented prior to its release.The two lead actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou, do a laughable job of portraying their respecting characters. Stoicism is the best adjective to use here.The story as is shown in the movie lacks any sort of urgent rhythm to it, this despite a script that features a Europe hopping context. Hanks and Tatou go here and there, do this and that, all the while every single detail is said to the viewer as if one were in kindergarten. 'We must find the secret to the Holy Grail because my grandfather died for it.' 'Right, allow me to crack the code verbally and visually so a two year old could understand it. 'Following that we have to go to Scotland in order to use da Vinci's device on stone tablet, which remember, unlocks the secret of Mary Magdalene.' 'I really think this can be done in only a few days with practically no sleep.'Granted, the book's complexity required explanatory prose, yet the end result is so tediously laid on that the film is chock full of uninteresting dialogue. When the theories are presented, the counter-theories are declared at the same instant, apparently concluding the audience is too lazy or stupid make up their own minds. Controversial source material such as this should be said with conviction by the filmmakers, whether the viewer believes it is right or wrong, and not give politically correct garbage as not to offend anyone. A perfect example is Oliver Stone's JFK, where a clear message is conveyed and doesn't hide its viewpoint for the sake of agreeable cinema. The European locations are a tourist's wet dream, historically and visually appealing. However, the cinematography comes off as more like a TV commercial than actual cinema, foregoing any form of stylishness for mundane images.However, Ian McKellen is the only one to get it right in this god awful mess. His dramatics are at their usual best, despite said dialogue and the rest of the movie being so inferior. Bettany too does a reasonable job as Silas, though emotional exaggeration does occur from time to time. Their screen time alone influenced my decision to not give a worse score.The Da Vinci Code perfectly captures what casual entertainment represents, avoiding boldness whatsoever. What a waste.",3,24,48,19 November 2006
