Deja Vu," Deja Vu
","Time travel is a consistently popular plot device, a Hollywood convention for its mass appeal; depending on the ambition of the work, it can be as simple or as complicated as is desired or required. 'Deja Vu' achieves a consistent balance, presenting its hard science fiction concepts to viewers in an easily understandable manner. The result is a complex film that doesn't buckle under the weight of a convoluted screenplay, remaining a thorough action blockbuster throughout despite its intended depth.Denzel Washington carries the film to great effect, his convincing performance and clear enthusiasm for the material an influential factor in how the feature doesn't necessarily demand a great amount of suspended disbelief. Granted, there is an abundance of fallacies and ambiguities throughout that could threaten to detract from its credibility, but the film is ultimately as much for a popcorn audience as it is for the intellectual crowd. The cost of heavy scrutiny and flawless coherence would appear to be an extremely entertaining experience, and in the case of 'Deja Vu', it is most certainly a price worth paying.8/10",8,2,3,16 June 2012
