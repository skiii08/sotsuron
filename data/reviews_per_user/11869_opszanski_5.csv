Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Another Sherlock Holmes film and Another Missed Opportunity
","Yes, it is time for another Holmes film. I'll speak in general terms as to why I still don't like this series so you don't have to worry about spoilers.If there's one thing I hate it's uninspired movie making. While people can say there was large deal of inspiration in this film it was not situated on the topic I consider to be essential when making a Sherlock Holmes movie. When you put a title like Sherlock Holmes on a movie, Your talking about a famed literary character. Someone who solves crimes with a passion. The same way many of us might focus our attention on a common hobby Holmes focuses his attention tenfold on one objective: solving problems. His one goal is to collect every bit of possible evidence from a crime scene and then use his powerful deductive skills to ascertain the particulars in his investigation.The fascination comes from his exactness. His focus and concentration on the precision of his conclusions makes him more of a computer than a man. 'A calculating machine' as Watson put it, donating his whole life to putting pieces of evidence together and see what the finished product shows. An yet, through the cold nature of his personality you see a glimpses of humanity. His friendship with Watson that strikes much deeper than it appears, his love of music that shows how human he is in the presence of genuine art, and his zeal for a dramatic conclusion of triumph that was his form of art. When you look deep enough you realize his work isn't that of a computer, but that of an artist.In the context of this perspective this movie misses on a level not seen in sometime. I understand this is just an opinion and that my opinion is worth as much as the other thousands of reviews on this website, but I truly think this movie fails to capture the spirit of the books. When Holmes and Watson communicate to each other, it resembles that of a bitter couple then that of two people who genuinely respect each other. Needlessly arguing over trivial problems that never existed in the stories and you can only find their style of arguing from a modern day bromance. Holmes is very logical, but it seems superficial and meant to be more of a hero advantage than an authentic skill of an individual. I understand there is a need for action and that Holmes was a fighter in the books, but fighting was only present when necessity called for it. Holmes's physical ability was like any other skill in his repertoire; there for the purpose of furthering progress in an investigation. In this movie, fighting takes place for the sole purpose of the excitement of a fight scene. This seems to be a reoccurring error that is present at every turn in this movie. For example, in the stories Holmes would be careless and say hurtful things because they were required to overcome an obstacle in his investigation whether listening to non-essential facts or the threat of having his plans disarranged. In this movie he was a jerk for the sake of entertainment. In the stories Holmes was cold natured because emotions corrupt his judgement and lead to illogical conclusions, I don't even need to explain how much this wasn't the case in this film.A person I found very disappointing was Moriarty. In the short story 'The Final Problem', Moriarty was supposed to be the great obstacle Holmes would overcome at the cost of his life. Doyle at the time intended this to be the last challenge for his detective and intended to be the ultimate class of intellects. Holmes in the story realizes after a series of cat and mouse mental confrontations that he must make the supreme sacrifice to rid the world of Professor Moriarty and he decides to follow through with it (or so he was meant to). The Movie completely failed at capturing a sense of this. The substance and development in this film was lacking to such a great degree it was depressing. You would think you were watching a video game storyline with the amount of effort they put into the development of the Holmes/Moriarty rivalry. We start out towards the end of their feud, this is not a problem since the story too took place towards the end showing that this isn't a fatal error. The error comes in when you consider that their rivalry is not interesting nor engaging. There is no depth to their personalities and is ultimately as engaging as two opposites confronting one another in a reality TV show. The is no authenticity to their mental struggle.I understand I'm asking a lot for a movie to meet my specific expectations, but I believe my view is the core of many Sherlockian fans. It's not like these have to be specifically exact, but there is a need for a 'ballparkish' attempt at recreating the spirit of the stories. The BBC series 'Sherlock' does a decent job of this. This movie, on the other hand, seems to be a 19th century based spy movie with elements of a Michael Bay film sprinkled on top. Without the crucial character development that made the stories great, this is simply a superficial action movie with 'Sherlock Holmes' as the title.",3,17,33,15 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," I'm Sorry, What?
","The rise of this movie on the top 250 - and the praise it receives - is as baffling to me as anything.While Star Wars (1977) is overrated in my view, it is still nonetheless a good film. This movie, on the other hand, is little more than mediocre. The first 35 minutes is spent on a drawn out rescue mission that is stretched to the point of tedium and has maybe 3 interesting or noteworthy moments. That's an entire third of the movie wasted on something that should've taken half the time. How anyone can call the opening of 'Revenge of the Sith' too long while defending this is anyone's guess.After that, we get some truly cringe dialogue and character interactions that make no sense. The one that hits you in the face like a sledgehammer is the relationship between Lando and Han Solo. Like, okay, I could understand Han forgiving Lando for what happened in episode 5, but for God's sake *actually include the forgiveness scene.* Han doesn't even seem to care that Lando was the reason why HE WAS TORTURED. They become instant best buddies chumming it up out of nowhere. It's like he's saying 'Hey man, I know you screwed us over and almost got us all killed before, but oh well boys will be boys amirite?'As for the climax, the space battle is pretty good, and the scenes between Vader, Luke, and the Emperor are the best parts of the movie by far. The fight against the Empire on Endor, on the other hand, is bloody awful. There are exactly 0 stakes in anything, and we essentially get a pack of teddy bears beating up the empire by throwing rocks. There's no tension, and the 'struggle to win' is played as a joke.How is this the 80th best movie ever made? I bet you there are 10 thousand better films than this one (at least!)
It seems as though only episode 5 actually deserves the praise it gets - that movie is legitimately great. The rest of the original trilogy falls well short of the God-tier quality people attribute to it - and episode 6 is the worst offender by far. It seems like this movie is playing with house money; and not in any positive way where the story takes some risks. Instead, it feels as though not enough effort is put into this, and very poor writing choices are made with far too much confidence. This is a movie that doesn't attempt to hide its flaws, they are all out in the open and blatant - as if the bad writing was intentional.",5,3,4,21 June 2019
Transformers," The best of the worst is still terrible
","Before I begin, yes, it is the best of the trilogy and is actually watchable.Still awful. Just terrible. I'm no fan of Michael Bay and he truly influenced the future of movie making in the worst possible way. These 3 movies will stand out in history as the trilogy that embodies everything wrong with Hollywood movies.Some people will say that's going too far, some people might say that they enjoyed these movies and were good entertainment. The truth is there is nothing wrong with explosions and action packed movies, but this movie marks the all time lowest point of originality and ingenuity.In many ways this film has a worse effect then the sequels because its actually trying to come off as an inspirational and decent movie, which only puts emphasis on it's flaws. Revenge of the Fallen was a complete joke Dark of the Moon can't be taken with the least bit of seriousness.I'll start by addressing how annoying everyone in this film is. There is not ONE character in this film that I would enjoy seeing in another movie. Shia LaBeouff turns his douche bag gauge on high and everyone from the sector seven agent to the parents were intolerable. I've never seen a film before where by the end I despised the sight of the cast like this. Why is everyone acting like an idiot? There is not one person with a shred of dignity and they all act like characters in a cartoon. Is that they aiming for? Make the movie as unrealistic as the cartoon? Why not put the autobots in a clown suit and have them perform parlour tricks?One of the worst parts of this movie is how over dramatic the scenes are. It's almost like Michael Bay has becomes so deranged he actually imagines he's making a masterpiece. The scene where bumblebee is caught by the military is so over dramatized you think Bambi's mother is about to be killed. One of the most awful scenes happens when Meghan Fox's character harnesses bumblebee to the tow truck and then drives into an alley. There, she breaks down with a montage of the heros' struggles. The sheer absurdity of this scene was enough to make me burst out laughing. I suppose it's meant to symbolize their struggle and their courage to overcome it. The sheer stupidity of this scene is baffling to the point of comedy. They spend the whole time making some huge juggernaut explosion sequence and NOW after all that nonsense they intend to inject some sample of reality? It gives off the same appearance as someone crying about the failure of their life while wearing a Barney costume.Terrible film, don't watch it unless you can look past everything but the action.",4,0,2,13 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This movie will surprise you (if you get past the first two)
","I have to admit, looking at episode 1&2, this was the best we could have hoped for. If the storyline doesn't impress you then maybe the scope of the movie will.This is still nowhere near as good as at least episode 4&5, but Revenge of the Sith definitely surpassed expectation (which may mean a lot or nothing to some people). I look at it kind of like Rocky 3; bigger, but nowhere close to the original.Of course, in order to be content with this movie, many star wars fans would need to look past episode 1&2, something many people aren't willing to do. For that reason, I understand their point of view. This film is still filled with many reminders that this is still part of the prequels. For one, the romantic dialogue between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman is still quite painful to watch. The lack of chemistry is quite obvious. George Lucas was never good in this department (at least in the prequels). At least the padme/anakin relationship was pushed to a secondary storyline.There are many other examples of disappointments in this film (inconsistent character development, Padme dies by loosing the power of love, Anakin looses the battle by standing two feet lower than Obi-wan, Darth Vader throws a temper tantrum, to name a few). It's important, however, to look past these and actually see a good movie behind it.For one, Ian McDiarmid was incredible as Palpatine. He stole almost every scene he was in. Ewan McGregor, the only real steady actor throughout the prequels, turns in a good performance. Even Hayden Christensen, who I don't care for at all as an actor, does better in this movie than I expected.The story line was also quite engaging. Where Lucas's writing talent lacks in romance he makes up for in politics. Lucas was able to create a competent storyline involving Jedi politics and the sith takeover of the senate. There were many eemotional scenes throughout. The order to extinguish the jedi was a moving spectacle and Obi-wan heated exchanges with Anakin was also more engaging then I would have anticipated. The concluding scenes were also powerful with the emergence of Darth Vader and the realization that all the pieces were falling into place. The ending took place cleverly on Tatooine featuring music many fans will recognize from episode 4.And talk about battles! Actions buffs will have plenty to rejoice about here. Apart from the clone battles, there were many lightsaber duels including Obi-wan vs Grievous and Anakin vs Dooku. The main battle between Obi-wan and Anakin was slow in some places, but I believe they did a great job and the result is likely the best duel in the saga. And come on, who didn't want to see Yoda and Lord Sidous have an all out, no holds barred, lightsaber and force duel? These fights might seem as gimmicks to inflate the impact of the film, but at least they succeeded if that was the case.Revenge of the Sith is without question the best of the prequels and Star Wars fans would be missing out if they didn't at least give this movie an honest chance. I actually think it tops episode six, a remarkable accomplishment in itself if that is the case (IMDB doesn't agree with me but Rotten Tomatoes does). If you put up with the first two, you should at least give this a try.8/10",8,1,3,15 September 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," A Huge Film That Refuses to Play it Safe
","SPOILERS!!SPOILERS!!So many times the third part of the trilogy is what kills a franchise's momentum. Spiderman, X-Men, even the legendary Godfather movies could not hold consistent over three films. Chistopher Nolan, on the other hand, has demonstrated that he has the ingenuity and talent to achieve such a feat.Not only has he made a conclusion as solid as the rest of the series, in my opinion he has outdone himself and made the best Batman movie yet. Of course, I am sure that there are many who would vehemently disagree and contest that The Dark Knight remains the best of the three. I would certainly not be in the position to prove them otherwise. Just like I wouldn't be in the position for someone who thought Batman Begins was the best. That's my point, all three films are of such high quality that anyone can choose their favourite knowing it's a solid film. It ultimately depends on what you like in a movie that determines which one is your favourite. For me, what makes Rises the best of the three is how different it is. This is, without a doubt, the most ambitious of the three and the stakes are raised to new heights. The city is in anarchy and the Bat is broken. Bruce Wayne must pull himself back together and truly transform himself for the first time in 8 years into the true Batman.One thing I love in movies is watching your hero tested to the point where he actually fails the first time. A rusty Batman is forced to return to save Gotham from a new threat. This leads to the first encounter between Batman and Bane. This is my favourite scene in the whole movie. Not because I hate Batman and want him to fail, but because this scene legitimises Bane and shows what state Batman is in. It was so interesting to see a tired Batman far from his peak using all his tricks and Bane unflinchingly persevering. The speech Bane gives when Batman attempts to conceal himself in the dark is epic and terrifying. It's the first fight between the two and the emerging villain lands the KO to take the first fight, with devastating results. It's this kind of encounter that made the 'Knightfall' comic series great. I honestly couldn't believe they actually put in the backbreaking scene, and boy was I mesmerized with what I saw. The bulky bane picks up a battered Batman and delivers a devastating knee to the back, severing the spine. This was the protagonist's lowest point and God was it a fascinating drop. That's when you know it's a great movie, when it sucks you in and takes you to the depths of disaster so the hero can claw his way back.I'm not going in much further into the movie, I just wanted to give my brief opinion and describe one of my favourite scenes. I will say that the actors were incredible and all brought their 'A' game. Anne Hathaway shocked me by surpassing my expectations as Catwoman, further cementing the wise words 'In Nolan we trust'. Alfred was the heart of the movie, plain and simple. Bane was awesome. I know people will always be more fascinated with Joker from the second film but there are merits that make Bane even more menacing. He's a psychopathic crime boss, who's cold philosophy and intimidating presence is only topped by his cunningness. He was a joy to watch.A great film, one of my personal favourites.",10,1,4,22 July 2012
