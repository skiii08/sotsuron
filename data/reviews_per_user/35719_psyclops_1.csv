Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Every Saga has a Brilliant Beginning!
","Well, my expectations were extremely high and I have been anticipating this film for so long, I was afraid that it may be an anticlimax. But no fear! It was great, exceeding even my hopes - the plot is an excellent start to the Good/Evil, Light/Dark saga, with some very clever twists and origins that will become more important later.  Less epic than the originals, yes, but these are simpler times and the dark forces are just beginning to rise......I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to thank George Lucas personally at the charity Premiere in San Francisco for a lifetime of fun.  And with this film, he steps it up a gear!I thought that the characters were well developed for their positions; I think that a lot of the criticism Lucas has received can be marked down to the fact that the main characters are a staid Queen, two reserved Jedi Knights and a 10 year old boy - all of whom would tend to be less than emotionally available!  I particularly enjoyed little Anakin, who is both written and portrayed brilliantly for the child genius he is.  Yes, Jar Jar Binks is there for the kids, but he did have some hilariously clumsy moments......And of course the effects...... ah!  The rendered droids and creatures are to die for, and I could watch the Pod Race forever.  Lucas has pushed the state of the art so far with this release that we will never again be sure just what is reality...But for me the high point was the light saber fight between the Jedi and Darth Maul - the most amazing sword fight ever.  Ray Parkes (Darth Maul) is a highly skilled, balletic martial artist, and he brought the most dangerous and fun character to life with ease.  Full marks!Now we wait anxiously for Episode II......",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
