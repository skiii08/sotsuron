The Devil's Advocate," Grand, but not quite there.
","This is a film that is almost 'great.' I had a few gripes, primarily the issues with Keanu's inconsistent accent. Very much 'Rosemary's Baby' meets 'The Firm.' A decent, enjoyable film, but not a great one. Al Pacino was very good portraying his character, but Keanu... It's just his voice, man. Something about how forced and 'cool' he's trying to sound while putting on and off a Southern accent is something I can't stand. Story is decent, but not quite as epic and intense as the mood was going for as well. Still worth a watch, but it's not up to the standard it sets itself up to face.",7,2,3,9 October 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," Produced by Al Gore
","For the record, I enjoyed this film. As of writing this review, it is 4/8/20, if a timestamp doesn't already state that. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it's somewhat comforting to see a film where things go fantastically wrong... Zombie films are great for that as well. It helps remind us that things could be worse.Despite that, this is a very flawed yet entertaining movie. I wasn't a fan of some particular bits of CGI (wolves), some side characters seemed a little unnecessary, and quite frankly the primary idea seems to be a Global Warming (ahem sorry, *climate change*) 'what if.' A Leftist fearmonger's dream of a film. In other words, 'stop destroying the planet or we'll have another Ice Age.'Now... No one takes that seriously, nor should they. The world has been supposed to be ending more times than one could count. Do your part as far as you feel necessary. Love people.At the end of the day this was anejoyable film outside of feeling like Leftist Global Warming propoganda cooked up by Hollywood. Enjoy it, but don't think too hard. It's just fantasy.",7,1,4,8 April 2020
Quantum of Solace," Not Quite As Bad As They Say.
","I just finished this film, and I still have no idea what it was about.The plot from what I could make out of it wasn't very good, weak Bond villain, and clich√© character motivation, and average dialogue.However, the film is gritty and intense at times. The action scenes were great, and HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN BOND ON A BOAT.As a standalone it isn't horrid, but you could do much better than this.",4,0,3,5 December 2018
Incredibles 2," The Film We Forgot We Wanted.
","The story is pretty average, and it definitely lacks a lot of the charm that the original film possessed. Some more progressive undertones tended to feel a little preachy to those of us that are in the political zone, which usually ruins some of the 'innocent magic,' movies can have.Kids will have no idea and ultimately this is a children's film, so while it is of course not intellectually stimulating it's still a fun ride.Instead of a sequel, we got a video game. And now that we have fhe sequel I think the world is more complete... But it could have been much, much better.",4,0,1,7 February 2019
