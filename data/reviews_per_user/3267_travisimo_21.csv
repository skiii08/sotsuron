Requiem for a Dream," Very Powerful and Disturbing
","If there ever were an anti-drug movie that would scare the living crap out of you from trying the stuff, this movie would be it.  Darren Aronofsky's camerawork is so dizzying and manic that you feel like you really are viewing what the characters are going through.  To make this even more effective, the score to the film, with those haunting strings, is so damn creepy, they alone would give me nightmares!  My only complaint about the direction and the story is that some scenes do go a little overboard, such as the scene where the room transcends into a game show.  But I guess scenes like that give you an idea of the craziness that goes on from an addict's point of view.As for the performances, they are nothing less than stellar.  Witnessing the descent of these characters is so powerful; you can't turn away for a second.  Ellen Burstyn gives a much-deserved Oscar-nominated performance as an elderly woman who spirals into drug addiction simply because she wants to look her best.  This can happen to anyone.  It's almost chilling to think of one of my loved ones doing this.  Marlon Wayans gives a very surprising and strong performance, while Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly epitomize the carefree, loving couple that gets in way too deep.  To see what happens to all these characters at the end of the movie is just disheartening.After watching this movie, you can't help but be blown away.  You want to talk about it and think about it for quite some time.  Just like drugs, this film will never really leave you.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo!

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just Chill
","First off, I'm definitely a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy.  I'm not as die-hard as some, but I've enjoyed the movies greatly over the years. As for The Phantom Menace, it's definitely not my favorite of the films, but I definitely don't despise it.I still feel transported into the Star Wars world when I watch Phantom Menace.  I get to see what led up to the original trilogy, and truthfully, I didn't pay that much attention to Anakin in this movie.  I get more intrigued about Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and the Jedi Council.  Sure there are moments where there's too much talk, but Episode I displays some great sci-fi action scenes; such as the pod race with its awesome visual and sound effects, and the light saber duel between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon.People also complain about Jar Jar, but he honestly didn't bug me too much. He's a minor character who's just a clumsy oaf.  He may generate a few laughs, but he's not a character that I concentrated on.  I also thought the animation used to create Jar Jar and the other digital characters wasn't too shabby either.  They did stand out a little and may not have been done as well as Gollum in LOTR, but it's still a solid and groundbreaking effort by ILM.What did annoy me the most were the Trade Federation characters.  I thought their costumes just weren't well made, especially when their dialogue didn't match how their mouths were moving.  They also just stood out like sore thumbs.  I wish Mr. Lucas had decided whether or not to keep all his alien characters digital.Nevertheless, I thought the visual effects were top notch.  The story is good Star Wars material.  It may not have been the best, and there were some awkward lines, but it didn't deter me in any way from enjoying this movie. I think moviegoers should take this movie for what it is, sit back, and just enjoy it.  It's good fun!My IMDb Rating: 8/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B+ (Memorable)",8,17,35,24 January 2004
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An Animation Fan's Dream
","For anyone who grew up watching cartoons (I can't imagine anyone who didn't!), this movie is perfect for you!  If anything, it is just amazing to see the unprecedented collaboration between Disney, Warner Brothers, and Tex Avery.  Like the geek I am, I squealed with delight when Donald and Daffy duked it out in a piano duel and when I saw the memorable skydiving scene with Mickey and Bugs.  It was also fantastic to see other animation legends, like Droopy and Betty Boop.I enjoyed this movie a lot when I was a kid (even though the villain, Judge Doom, scared me a little).  As for the adult jokes and innuendoes, they just flew over my head at that time.  I just laughed at the baby because he smoked and talked like an adult.  Only until I watch it now that I'm delightfully shocked at the adult humor involved.  It is a movie that appeals to the older set with its classic characters and modern humor, but kids can still enjoy it by seeing some of their favorite characters.As for the work that went into this movie, I just find it amazing.  Bob Hoskins, in particular, deserved an Oscar just for the degree of difficulty he took in the role of Eddie Valiant.  Not only did he have to disguise his thick British accent, but also he had to act with invisible characters and make it all look realistic.  And what a job he did!  As a viewer, you are immersed in this world where people and toons come together.  You get so caught up in the storyline and the characters that you don't really take a step back and think that this is just impossible.The actors, the puppeteers, the animators, the directors, and countless other staff members just did a phenomenal job with this movie.  It is truly one-of-a-kind, and I don't think we'll see anything quite like this again. Sure, there's been 'Space Jam' and 'Looney Tunes: Back in Action,' but I don't think those movies come close to the innovation and memorable storytelling that 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' achieved.  Kudos to everyone involved in this picture.  Hopefully someday they can all get together again.  I think I speak for many people when I say that we're eager to go back to Toontown!My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",10,5,6,6 March 2004
Se7en," Feel the Suspense!
","Se7en is an odd movie to enjoy so much.  I've seen bits of pieces of it in the past, but it was only recently that I watched the whole thing.  I was gripped to it for every minute.  It's just a smart and intriguing crime thriller, but don't eat anything while watching it!None of the scenes really grossed me out when I watched it recently, but that's only because I knew what I was getting into.  I probably was a little queasy after watching some of those scenes the first time.  Yet we never see the crimes being done, only the aftermath.  Seeing those murders actually take place may have been a bit much.Nevertheless, Se7en rides on some great storytelling, gritty direction, and an all-around great cast.  One of the things I enjoyed most about the movie was the chemistry between the main characters.  This was most evident at the dinner scene as we were introduced to a friendlier, civilian side of the characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, as well as a strong supporting role played by Gwyneth Paltrow.And I should not forget the classic ending to this movie.  You will remember it for a long time as well as the villain, who is played by an un-credited famous actor.  You probably already know whom it is, but in the spirit of limiting any spoilers, I won't go further.All in all, Se7en is just a great flick.  It's fun, it's interesting, it keeps you guessing, and it's memorable.  The only drawback being that it may not be for the faint of heart.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo!

Underworld," What in the World?!
","Many questions arise when watching Underworld.  (1) What are lycans?  (2) Who are deathdealers?  But most confusingly, (3) who in the world is Scott Speedman??!  Underworld answers some of these questions and reveals the plot way too far into the movie.  The first two-thirds of Underworld is devoted to shooting, killing, biting, and some chitchat that makes little sense because none of the plot is revealed.For my father, and I think for many moviegoers, Underworld takes so long to make sense that there's little reason to stick around.  However, I toughed it out, and after about 90 minutes, I saw a glimpse of a story unfolding. The story is fairly interesting as we're told how this whole mess started, but it took way too long to get to that point.  The actors were unrecognizable before and after this movie (except it was fun to see Kate Beckinsale in that leather outfit).  The action sequences were commendable, but may be a little overkill (especially the ending with a very silly death of one of the main characters).Underworld reminds me of the time my friends dragged me to see Blade 2.  I had no real interest in seeing that movie and am really not a fan of vampire/werewolf movies.  After seeing Blade 2, I was not swayed, but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  I think Underworld will do the same for fans of those types of movies.  However, for the average, recreational moviegoer like myself, Underworld is just going to fly over your head.My IMDb Rating: 5/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: C+ (Flawed but Worthy)",5,0,0,21 January 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An E-Ticket Movie
","After working on an internship at Disney World and becoming a devoted Disney fan, I was absolutely psyched for the Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  The only other movies that matched my excitement for Pirates were the new Star Wars movies, and let me tell you, Pirates did not disappoint!  I dragged my parents to see it during the first weekend and was a bit saddened when the experience was over.Fast-forward to Christmas, and my ever-observant parents give me the DVD.  I watch it again, and it's just as good as before, if not better!  My only complaint from the first time I saw it was that the movie was a little long, but watching a second time, I was never bored or was never looking at my watch.Every minute is jam packed full of action, humor, and excitement.  As so many people have noted, Johnny Depp absolutely steals the show.  I was a bit iffy when I first heard he was cast because of movies like From Hell and The Ninth Gate, but he has created one of the most memorable characters of all time.  His performance in this movie will be appreciated and enjoyed by people for years and years to come.Along with Mr. Depp, the acting ensemble in this movie is quite good. Geoffrey Rush uses his Oscar clout in a great role as the evil Captain Barbossa.  His stature in this movie results in a very fun and formidable villain.  Orlando Bloom also does a good job as sort of a naive citizen who becomes a brave hero for the love of his life.  Which brings me to Keira Knightley who is just so H-O-T you can't take your eyes off her.  I think she is definitely going to have a very prestigious movie career as already indicated in the successful Love Actually.So without making this review way too long, you can tell that I love this movie.  It's definitely one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  The special effects are great.  The story is smart and involving.  The acting and direction are phenomenal.  And most importantly, this movie is just fun, a main ingredient that most movies should strive for.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",10,1,3,18 January 2004
Finding Nemo," A Classic for Years to Come
","I may have been one of the last people to see this movie.  I would have loved to see it in the theaters, but my dad just does not like animated films.  So it was kind of a surprise to hear him say that he really enjoyed this one.  And why is that?  Because he can relate to it, and I don't think he's the only parent out there that felt the same way about Finding Nemo.Out of all the Pixar movies, I think this one is the most meaningful.  What parent can't relate to letting go of their child and letting them live their own life?  And what child can't relate to being overprotected by their parents?  This film reaches to people of all ages and backgrounds, that it is purely astonishing.  You can bet that this movie will hold a place in the hearts of millions of people for a long time.Now, what do I think?  Well, honestly, it's not my favorite Pixar flick.  I found Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2 to be funnier and more enjoyable.  That's not to say Finding Nemo doesn't have the comedic chops.  I thought the Bruce the Shark scene was absolutely hysterical, and Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks provided excellent voice-work for their characters.As for the animation, Pixar just keeps getting better and better.  I was quite impressed with Sulley in Monsters Inc, but there were so many beautiful things to look at in Finding Nemo, I can't really narrow down one example.So with all these great things, I still can't say that I absolutely loved this movie.  It seems perfect in many ways, but it's just not one of my favorites.  But hey, I'm just one person.  This movie is going to be a favorite for millions of others out there.  Bravo, Pixar!My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)",9,0,1,7 December 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," More Action, Less Talk
","I must be weird, because I haven't found anyone else that has the same opinion as I do about The Matrix Trilogy. The first one was obviously fantastic, but I hated the second one. Therefore, I expected to hate the third one, only to be pleasantly surprised by what I saw.My chief complaint against The Matrix Reloaded is that it relied too heavily on philosophy mumbo-jumbo that I just couldn't follow it; that is, if I really wanted to. This time around, things were still a little confusing. It started a little slow, and the ending was a bit questionable, but everything in between was action-packed.The Mechwarrior-like weapons the people of Zion used were quite impressive and fun to watch. The whole battle at Zion just had so much going on that you can't help but marvel at the level of special effects this movie achieves. The final battle between Neo and Agent Smith was quite impressive also. After all the battles they've had over the trilogy, I didn't know how this one can be any different or any more special, but the Wachowski brothers definitely raised it up to another level.Like I said, this movie is still pretty confusing. However, if you read other reviews or visit some Matrix sites, things get a little clearer and will give you a different perspective. All in all, though, The Matrix Revolutions is a pretty fun, action-packed sci-fi extravaganza.My IMDb Rating: 8/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B+ (Memorable)",8,8,15,20 February 2004
Cold Mountain," A Gritty Look Back
","If there was anything that really stuck out to me in Cold Mountain, it was the beautiful imagery.  The scenery was just amazing, and you really get a sense that you are looking at a Civil War-era South.  Some may complain that this movie lacked compassion or chemistry, but wasn't life back then a lot more restricted than it is now?I thought the actors did a tremendous job, but it was the side characters that really stole the show.  Natalie Portman gave a very strong performance in a small, but powerful scene.  Philip Seymour Hoffman provided some surprising comic relief as did Renee Zellwegger who really shined as a tomboy who resurrects Nicole Kidman's broken down ranch.  In fact, I'd say Renee deserves an Oscar for this role, but that's not for me to decide.The movie is a little long, but you come to appreciate the struggle Jude Law's character goes through as he treks miles to reunite with Nicole Kidman, all while being hunted down as a traitor.  I imagine this story isn't that far from the truth.  Life was quite different back then, as I noted earlier, and probably more ruthless, so it wouldn't surprise me that some people were hunted down like dogs.So overall, this is a very powerful flick.  It gives you a true sense of what life was like back then, and it's another adaption of the classic Odyssey tale that just never gets old.My IMDb Score: 10/10.  My Yahoo!

The Usual Suspects," A Smart, Sleek Crime Drama
","I was at a bit of a disadvantage watching this movie, because it's one of my sister's favorites, and I already had a hunch of what the ending was. Nevertheless, this movie is still pretty good as it keeps you thinking.  The story can get kind of confusing with its many flashbacks and it did seem a little slow until we're introduced to the diabolical Keyser Soze, a heartless drug lord who killed his own family and strikes fear into any bad guy.From that point, you try to figure out who really is Keyser Soze.  It's very interesting to see how the story is played out and how we finally end up with the truth.  The Usual Suspects is a movie that makes you think long after you've watched it, and it showcases one of the best scheming villains in movie history.  This is definitely a must-see for any movie fan.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)",9,0,1,31 January 2004
Seabiscuit," It's Worth a Shot!
","Seabiscuit is one of those movies where I know it's a good, high-quality film, but I just can't really get into it.  It is a long movie, but I've enjoyed long movies before as long as they remain interesting throughout the whole film.I think my complaint, and somewhat of a compliment, is that the film spends a lot of time on character building.  The first hour seemed to devote itself to slowly introducing the characters and the setting of the Depression. It's a rich introduction and makes you appreciate the characters, but man, it kind of drags.  I kept wondering, 'Is this Tobey Maguire's character,' and 'Where is Seabiscuit?'  The last stage of the movie also seemed to drag. I know they needed to finish the complete story of Seabiscuit, but I was ready to end the movie an hour ago!Nevertheless, those are my only complaints.  The huge strength of the movie lies with the flawless acting.  Everybody committed something to the film and they all did it perfectly.  My particular favorite character was played by Chris Cooper.  His character is very unique, kind of odd, but most importantly, very interesting.  He plays sort of a horse whisperer who sees something in Seabiscuit no one has ever seen.  He did a most excellent job and should probably get another Oscar, even though it seems unlikely that the Academy would want to give consecutive Oscars to anyone nowadays.  Darn those Oscar politics!So all in all, this is a very good film.  Others may appreciate the story more than I did, particularly those interested in horses or American history.  I can see why the actors are so passionate about this movie.  Give this horse a chance and you may feel the same way, or you may end up bored. But hey, this movie is worth that shot!My IMDb Rating: 8/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B+ (Memorable)",8,0,0,30 December 2003
School of Rock," Rocking
","Most Jack Black movies crack me up.  I thought Saving Silverman was hilarious, and Orange County was a funny, upbeat movie.  While Jack Black may not be the best actor out there, or really had to step too far out of his range in The School of Rock, he is an extremely good fit in this movie. While I don't think this movie was as laugh-out-loud hilarious as Saving Silverman, School of Rock definitely had some very funny moments.  Jack Black's mannerisms and comedic timing are fun to watch in about any movie (except Shallow Hal.  I could have avoided that.)The kids in the movie also showed some real talent.  Whoever decided to hire kids that are musically talented rather than `professional actors' deserves a hearty pat on the back.  The kids were tremendous, and the final concert scene was absolutely perfect.  The chemistry between the kids and Jack Black was great too as you can tell this movie must have been a lot of fun for everyone to make.The School of Rock does something kind of rare by being a family film with an edge and even some heart (which I don't think Jack Black will ever readily admit).  Teachers, particularly music teachers, music fans, and just movie fans altogether should enjoy this movie.  I think it will be a comedy classic for many people out there.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.

Mulholland Drive," One Weird Dream
","After watching Mulholland Drive, I just wondered, 'What in the world did I just watch?!' Even though I was confused and perplexed during the movie (particularly the second half), I was still gripped by what I was watching. I especially enjoyed Naomi Watts' performance, especially considering her character(s) goes from one extreme to the next.Unlike most movies I've seen, Mulholland Drive made me think afterwards and made me want to research it out. I found Salon.com's assessment of the movie to be most helpful and interesting. It may not be 100% correct, but it did shed some light on the story.This movie was also the first time I've ever watched anything from the cult director David Lynch. Say whatever you want about Mr. Lynch, but for better or for worse, you definitely know when you're watching one of his movies. Most directors don't really stick out to me. They are talented, yes, but their contribution to a movie doesn't necessarily mean I can obviously notice their personal touch. David Lynch has his own offbeat style that's very recognizable, much like Stanley Kubrick and Quentin Tarantino. You may love David Lynch's style or you may be baffled by it (or both), but you know that a David Lynch movie is not going to be a run-of-the-mill picture.Overall, I'd say that Mulholland Drive is definitely a unique movie, which is probably an understatement. The story, while confusing, has a lot of depth to it if you ever want to research it out. The acting is well done, headed by Naomi Watts' powerful dual performance and Laura Harring's strong, quiet performance. Like the story, the direction is confusing, but it does stick out. As for the visuals, they will stick in your head for quite a while. I think Roger Ebert said it best that after watching Mulholland Drive, you'll tell your friends that you watched the strangest movie, much like you would tell them that you had the strangest dream.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.

Big Fish," A Touching, Imaginative Film
","'Big Fish' is the type of movie that made me think about the good things in life and inspires me to make the most of my life. We all know someone in our lives that would tell some big stories that would let our imaginations run wild, particularly when we were little kids. 'Big Fish' centers on a father that does this frequently and a son that doesn't know whether to believe anything his father has told him.All the stories are fun and intriguing with great directing and imagery from Tim Burton and fine acting by everyone involved in this picture. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor (who I just realized is one of my favorite actors, possibly because of my Star Wars bias) effectively bring the adventurous storyteller, Edward Bloom, to life. Both actors were just fun to watch in this movie as was Danny DeVito, in a perfectly fitted role as a circus owner/ringmaster, and the beautiful Alison Lohman as the object of Ed Bloom's affection.However, there were some moments in the movie that did test my patience a little. The movie was a little long, some of the lighting in the scenes was pretty dark, and I realized I preferred watching Ed Bloom's stories acted out rather than just hearing Ed Bloom talk about them. Whenever I have talked to someone like Ed Bloom, who goes off on stories like he did, I'd probably roll my eyes and tune them out. Maybe I won't do that anymore!!All that aside, though, this is one hell of a movie! It has a lot of heart and imagination, and it actually choked me up a little. It definitely got to me in a very good way. When this comes out on DVD, I will definitely add it to my collection, enjoy it for years to come, and maybe share the magic with others!My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo!

The Last Samurai," Powerful and Insightful
","The Last Samurai displays some of the best sword fighting I have ever seen in a movie.  Ken Watanabe gives an Oscar performance as the Samurai leader, Katsumoto.  Not only did he have some awesome fighting scenes, but also his character was deep and just fun to watch.  Tom Cruise gives a surprising performance as a disgruntled American general turn samurai.  Needless to say, I was skeptical of Tom Cruise pulling this role off, but he did so pretty nicely.The story is a powerful, moving piece, but it can get kind of long and depressing.  This isn't really the feel-good movie of the year.  It also got a little confusing particularly with the blossom scene.  I zoned off for one minute, and I was lost on the significance of the blossom for the rest of the movie.  Oh well, it wasn't too big of a deal, and I enjoyed the movie anyway.  If anything, this movie gives great insight on the mysterious and intriguing life of the samurai.  It's definitely a good experience.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo!

The Matrix Reloaded," For Matrix Fanatics Only
","I think of myself as a standard Matrix fan.  I have the videocassette of the first Matrix movie and have seen it maybe five times or so.  It's an absolutely fantastic movie, but I wouldn't consider myself to be a fanatic of the whole Matrix phenomena.  Therefore, I just couldn't get into this first sequel.  Maybe you have to be a Matrix fanatic or be more familiar with The Matrix than I was to enjoy this movie.  I just felt there were absolutely too much talk and too much philosophy mumbo-jumbo that only die-heard Matrix believers can decipher.Nevertheless, the visuals for this movie were fantastic with the Freeway scene and the Agent Smiths battle.  I believe the movie took a turn for the better when we were introduced to Monica Bellucci.  That was a sight for sore eyes!!  Other than that, there's nothing I really liked about this movie.  The scenes in Zion were absolutely ridiculous and laughable, and I got absolutely lost in the scenes with The Oracle and The Architect.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," A Movie Milestone
","Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",10,88,95,14 January 2004
The Lion King," A Beloved Classic
","This is my second favorite Disney film (next to Dumbo, only because that was my childhood favorite).  I watched the new DVD recently, and it's just amazing as always.  From the wonderful opening sequence to the inspiring finale, this movie is perfect from beginning to end.While computer animation seems to be getting all the attention lately, The Lion King is just as beautiful and amazing as the latest Pixar films.  The soundtrack is just absolutely amazing.  Every song is catchy and very memorable.  Hans Zimmer's score puts you right back in the movie.  Thank goodness I have my Lion King soundtrack!The characters are great too.  Who doesn't remember the classic scene where Mufasa appears to Simba?!  On the other side, Scar makes for a very treacherous and diabolical villain.  And Timon and Pumbaa are lovable and hilarious; which means I'm looking forward to LK 1.5 just for them (which is saying quite a bit for a direct-to-video film!)This movie also transcends generations.  My 2-year old niece was absolutely fixated on this movie for the whole 90 minutes, and that's saying something! I can't think of anything wrong with this movie.

X2: X-Men United," Family Fun!
","I recently watched X2 for the second time recently, this time with my parents.  I enjoyed it so much in the theaters that I bought it the first weekend it was released.  Now, I wanted to share the X-Men phenomena with my parents, but I'm not sure they really got what the big deal was.  Watching it with this new perspective in my mind, I admit the plot can get kind of confusing with the numerous characters and their unique and peculiar mutant abilities.  Nevertheless, I think they still enjoyed the movie especially for its awesome special effects.  Unlike a lot of action movies, the special effects enhanced X2's story rather than dumbing it down.It is probably a better movie if you do understand the characters though.  I never really was ever confused myself as I enjoyed the X-Men cartoons when I was little.  Nearly all the mutants in X2 stood out in one way or another. Wolverine was awesome as always, Nightcrawler was a great addition to the sequel, Jean Grey became much more interesting in this movie, and I think Mystique stood out the most with her great efforts to save Magneto and all of mutantkind.  However, I do think Cyclops definitely took a backseat in this movie.So overall, X2 is just a top-notch action adventure.  It's not necessary to see the first movie or be familiar with the mutants, but I think it does help.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)",9,0,0,17 January 2004
Cinderella," A Symbol of the Disney Magic
","As a young boy, I always sort of hated 'Cinderella,' since I was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy.  I wanted 'Dumbo,' but my sisters won out, and we got 'Cinderella.'  They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures.A lot has changed since then.  My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces.  I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched 'Cinderella' together.  With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched 'Cinderella' with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw.From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament.  Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away?  I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story.  Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like 'Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo' and 'A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes' sort of whisked me back to the theme parks.  I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle.Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney.  That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about.  The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world.While 'Cinderella' may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history.  It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids.  I imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many, many people out there.  It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it does represent all that I love and admire about the Company.My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)",10,40,47,23 April 2004
Aladdin," Another Disney Masterpiece
","I remember seeing Aladdin in the movie theaters when it first came out.  I was a wee one back then and going to the theaters was a big deal.  After seeing this movie, I was just in awe for quite a while.  It was fun, it was exciting, and it was touching.  (I probably didn't think that exactly back then, but something like it!)Now that I've grown up and have become an avid Disney fan, I still greatly enjoy this classic.  The music is absolutely great thanks to Alan Menken, Tim Rice, and Howard Ashman.  Robin Williams provides amazing voice-work for the unforgettable Genie.  And the rest of the characters are great too.Yet something is just missing.  I just don't LOVE this movie.  I can't put my finger on why exactly.  After seeing Lion King again recently, I knew that I LOVED that movie.  Same with Dumbo as that was my childhood favorite. Aladdin is a Disney classic that has some of the best features you'll see in any of their movies.  I guess it's just not my favorite, which is really no big deal, but it prevents me from giving this a perfect score. Sorry!My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo!
