The Blair Witch Project," sooo dumb
",don't think this is a spoiler.. but i checked it just in case i hate that i even had to rate this a 1... this was sooo incredibly boring.. half the movie is arguing.. a quarter is dark and a quarter is crying.. i never paid to see it and i am thankful.. i had the luxury of fast forwarding through every 'day' scene and just watching the dumb 'night' scenes.. do not see this movie.. id rather watch the horror movie 'frogs' than see this again.. if you've ever seen it.. u know how bad this movie really is...seriously.. i wanna cry its soo bad..-1/10,1,3,6,6 December 2007
