Mission: Impossible III," Good action sequences
","Just got back from watching this movie. It was OK. Mindless action for a Saturday night. The action sequences were pretty impressive if you like CGI. I agree with an earlier post that 'True Lies' did the whole 'blow up a bridge thing' a little better. All in all a solid movie with a pretty good cast. Even Tom Cruise wasn't that bad, and I wasn't even Bo Jangled. Hoffman is the man. He is a great actor obviously relishing in the chance to be someone totally devoid of emotion. The only sense of emotion he shows is beating the cosbies out of Cruise. As for Ving and the other two, I think they could have been used better but the scenes they were in were cool, especially the Irish neddy. Well like I said it was OK and completely forgotten. Take care all. Simon",5,0,1,6 May 2006
