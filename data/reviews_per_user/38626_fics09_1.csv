The King's Speech," Phenom Acting!
","I am 26, i don't know much about George the VI so i went in not knowing much or very interested, but i came out impressed! The lead acting by Colin Firth is superb! He made this role seem so effortless thats how realistic it was, you would believe Colin has a stutter in real life, To just see how well Colin portrayed his character was great! He is always a great lead to have in a movie. I still love his performance in Love Actually. Colins Acting by far got 10/10 in my book. The supporting cast of Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter was amazing as well. As Bertie's speech teacher and friend he did an amazing job of holding his own, He had some funny lines, and some very touching serious lines as well that truly touched me. Finally Helena what can i say i love her small roles in ever film shes been in, she just has the awe to her and respect when the camera is put on her, she to me is a very unique actress and can play any role giving to her. Overall Geoffrey Performance 9.1/10 and Helenas 9.4/10. Overall Acting i would give 10/10 The story 7/10 overall enjoyment, considering i feel you have to be in the right mind set to enjoy this film i give it a 7.5 a def must see for 2011!",8,3,6,8 January 2011
