Casablanca," One of the Best...
","There has to be something wrong with this movie... ummm... I can't think of anything so I guess I'll actually have to write about the things I LIKE?It has a phenomenal story that is even more greatly emphasized with the United States joining the war in Europe. Though it was a current even then, the war setting was the perfect back-drop. It provided tension and one of the greatest and most iconic endings in movie history.It was edited and written very well. Small morsel just big enough to tease us at the right times provided us with necessary knowledge. It was light-hearted in just the right places.And the acting! Bogart and Bergman were made for each other. Well, in the movies at least.",9,2,3,11 May 2012
Citizen Kane," Rosebud...
","What brings meaning to our lives? When we die, what strange and unusual things will people remember about us? It's certainly easy to see why this movie has come to be known as 'the greatest movie of all time'. I don't know if I would go that far, but is undeniably one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The visuals are the defining characteristic in this film. The story takes a back seat in this masterpiece. Ever time I watch this film I marvel over the shots. 'How did they do that? How was that even thought of?'The movie is a true American icon. I just wish more people would actually watch it instead of all the parodies you see of it on TV.",8,0,1,11 May 2012
The Exorcist," What Did She Say?
","This is a movie that really strikes a cord with me. I am pretty sure that that same cord is struck in the rest of the world when they watch this movie. The devil is not just something you can hide in the closet from. He is unstoppable. If he wants to possess you, then you are finished.Along with the gruesome subject matter, you had some of the greatest effects of the time. I can see how unnerving it would have been to see a little girl twirl her head around or crab walk down stairs backwards and then vomit blood. (Yes, I realize that is only in a newer releases.)This is by far the best horror movie ever made. It doesn't rely on that old standby of a high body count. It survives because it has a story that people want to experience.",8,1,2,11 May 2012
Annie Hall," Made By Accident...
","Woody Allen certainly gets a lot of flak for his personal life. As sad as it may seem, I think that is why he isn't as popular as he should be. Even if he is weird, he definitely can make a brilliant film.His jokes in the film are humorous. I wouldn't go as far as to say that they are hilarious, but I will give him humorous. What really stands out in the film is they way he turns popular convention in movies on its end. Aside from them being these funny films, they are really and truly brilliantly filmed. It seems strange to put so much time and effort into a comedy, but Allen uses all of his knowledge of film as art to make the best movie possible.",Null,0,0,11 May 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Make 'Em Laugh
","I hate musicals! I absolutely can not stand them! I loathe them!Singin' in the Rain is different though. Most importantly, it has music that I actually want to listen to. Most musicals are bogged down with love songs that I don't care to hear, or songs just written to elongate the running time. I never once said, 'Oh Jeeze, they're singing again?'It's a clever concept that was done very well. It's like the Artist, but better! It was so cheerful and the colors blew my mind.Even the dancing in most musicals is cringe worthy. In 'Singin'', it actually inspired me to learn to dance. (For about a day, but those catchy songs were stuck in my head for at least two weeks after that.)I could really get into musicals if they were all like this one. Please God, help man make more musicals like Singin' in the Rain.",9,0,2,11 May 2012
Psycho," Hitchcock Did It...
","Who kills the 'main character' in the first half hour of the film. (By the way, the answer is Hitchcock.) That is just the kind of film making that he is known for, and Hitchcock does not disappoint on this one. Lighting played a crucial part in this movie. Whether is was Norman staring from his darkened room through two holes cut in the wall or having sandwiches amongst the stuffed birds that adorn the walls, the light really emphasized fear and vulnerability. Even scenes with Norman's 'mother' are so well lit, they keep that air of mystery.I suppose that I should talk about the most famous scene in the movie. Other than it being awesome, it has possible the best montage in a movie ever. It is certainly the best done. You have to force yourself to take in the whole thing. The brilliance of the montage is that you will miss something every time, but if you keep watching it, you have the potential to pick something up every time.",Null,0,0,11 May 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicholson Playing Someone in the Mental Hospital?
","Jack Nicholson plays the best crazy person that I have ever seen. This is the pinnacle of his career! Unfortunately, this is probably the movie that secured in everyones mind that Nicholson plays a crazy person well. He's been type casted ever since.It has a great story that actually very accurately depicts the inner workings of a mental facility like that. Especially for the time. You may think that the barbarism that takes place in the movie no longer existed at that point in time, but actually it still takes place in facilities like that all over the country. You better hope that if you get locked up, you get put with someone like Nicholson!",9,2,3,11 May 2012
