Ford v Ferrari," A treat for eyes and ears
","*Ford vs Ferrari*
Certainly a movie for car racing fans, but more so for vintage cars enthusiasts. Christian Bale excels his acting skills as the protagonist as a car tester/mechanic/racer. Matt Damon gives a great supporting performance. However, Jon Bernthal seems to be a wasted cast since his part where his performance matters gets peaked in the first 40 minutes. He appears to have no potential role after that. Nevertheless, watching the drama between team Ferrari and Ford unfold with sleek shining vintage beauties is a treat for eyes and ears. Cinematography, sound-mixing, screenplay, and editing is on point.

1917," Another war- film to remember
","*1917*
I, actually, am stunned after watching this film. It's hard to decide where to start. I didn't think any film would come close to Joker this year, but 1917 has arrived right next to the DC masterpiece. Huge amount of credits go to cinematography. It's an incredible talent because once the movie starts, you would realize that the director has not shouted CUT! and the cameras are rolling and the movie is moving ahead without any cuts! The actors' expressions, their makeup, the whole war scenario art composition, the story with a fabulous direction serves us a day in life of soldiers making us awe, worry, laugh, cry, and appreciate such a creation.My rating 9.2 ðŸŒŸ",10,2,3,9 February 2020
It Chapter Two," It's Horror and Comedy and Drama
","Never have I ever seen more similarity in characters and their grown-up versions. The looks and their acting is uncanningly similar. Kudos to casting. Bill Skarsgård has delivered an amazing thrilling clown performance as before. The movie is about as frightening as last one with often jump scares and gross gore details. Comedy is a high element in this second part by portraying it in words and actions equal. However, use of zombie make-up or graphics feels a tad bit more than required and backfires couple of times removing horror from serious scenes. There is an unexpected special appearance which fits well. Also, there are a few easter eggs or trivial similarities that remind you of previous works of Stephen King. All together, the creators have delivered a movie with expansive range of imagination and storyline that is worth one time watch.
