The Incredible Hulk," A well made hulk movie that's way better than the first one
","Everybody likes a green mean smashing machine. Sadly when Hulk first came to theatre in 2003, it was a big mess. Well this movie kinda redeemed it. With its amazing action and a way decent story. Its not a great film. But it wasn't bad at all. Its a good- ish movie that anyone could enjoy. First it has Ed Norton as a waay better Bruce Banner. He manage to portrayed a troubled scientist fighting his own inner demon. Second, you gotta respect the movie for starting the MCU. Yeah people maybe forgot but it wasn't Iron Man who started it all. It was this film. Now the best part of the movie itself. Hulk vs Abomination Battle at Harlem. It was one of the best duel in all of Marvel films. I mean what else do you want than The Hulk use his trademark power and catchphrase 'Hulk Smash!' The only flaw of this movie is that probably all the scene without Hulk in it is pure boring (except the parkour chase). Also the kinda bad CGI, but it still do.",6,0,0,13 October 2015
Aliens," Excellent sequel that take the first movie to a whole new level
","If you've seen the first film, this movie is not the same at all. Alien (the first one) is a slasher thriller set on an isolated ship. As for Aliens itself is more of an action thriller. So it's like comparing Dead Space and Dead Space. Aliens deliver us more action, more suspense, and more aliens. It's a story about a rescue mission with a lot of gunfire, people die, and more aliens that you could ever dreamed of. It's also have more intense moments, more character development as you hate or love some of the character along the way. But if you think this is less scarier than Alien, well it's not. Aliens contains the same horror Alien gave us. It never gets old of seeing a baby Xenomorph jump to people face or people's chest bursting Aliens. So if you like Alien, but wish it to be more action packed, more scary, and more intense. Then this is the movie you've been waiting for.",8,1,3,24 June 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Great story, amazing action, beautiful character design, but a bit rushed out
","The story in this movie is great, it has great motives and it made audiences question which side is right. It is darker than previous marvel movies and has a more serious topic since it's about politics, human experimenting, terrorism, and the causes of the destruction caused by The Avengers.The characters are so well written, they all have their motives except a few characters that i will talk about later. Captain having to decide whether he should help his friend Bucky and break the law or to support the government act to control the action of The Avengers. While Tony, trying to do what's right for him after seeing the aftermath of all the battle The Avengers fought before. And of course, the best part of the movie that is, the action. The action in this movie is phenomenal. It has the same style with the one in Winter Soldier, which we all love very much. But now, we had tons of other superheroes involves. And how they introduce and design Black Panther is amazing. But with Spider-Man.. Well i really liked the actor as Peter Parker. He got the witty nerd act going on. But once he jumped to the Spider-Man suit, well he never did actually since Spider-Man is just pure CGI, a bad CGI. And how they put Spider-Man in the movie is so rushed out. The character's involvement in the plot itself aren't even significant. It went the same with Ant-Man. They could honestly left them out from the film and it wouldn't make a difference, well beside that one awesome fight scene will be less epic. But in a serious movie with these deep characters, the two characters felt really out of place with their over the top sense of humor. I really wished they were introduced slower so we get to see the character developed more. The other thing about the movie I didn't like, is that the first half of the movie is very serious, emotional, and political but then BOOM action orgasm comes in. The action scene is awesome though, I loved them. But they shouldn't be very straight forward about it. They really just slapped it in the audience face. And how the plot progressed slow then suddenly every superhero on the earth start hitting each other up and blowing stuff up. But excluding all that, the ending was awesome and very emotional. It's certainly is better than the rest of the superhero movies that has came out this year and I even think it will be better than the rest to come (X-men, Suicide Squad, and Dr Strange). Definitely my top 5 marvel movie.WATCH IT NOW!",7,9,20,30 April 2016
