Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A visually beautiful introduction to the world we know as Star Wars
","The Grand ambience and aura of this film and the majestic world that George Lucas brings to the screen is that of the world of Star Wars, and George Lucas lets us into his imagination as if we could see into his dreams and watch his world unfold onto the screen. The power of the galactic senate, the secrets and mysteries of the jedi and the darkness of the Sith. It's almost as if we believe this world exists. It's almost as if we could hope to become Jedi ourselves and travel to distant worlds to face the Sith and the darkside. There is more power in Episode I then there is the other Star Wars movies and George gives us the mystical dreamworld that will serve as the backdrop for the entire series. We can almost smell the evil in the crumbling senate. We can sense the fear in Anakin and we can also feel the mystery of the Jedi. In episodes 4-6 we are introduced to this world and the story seems more majestic than the world itself. That's where Episode I is different. The ambience of the film itself out does the script and characters and it leaves us some to be desired in the story itself. Which the reverse is true in 4-6. The hope that we have in Episode I is that a lot is left unresolved and it can only mean for a much better story in Episodes II-III, in which when the story will fit perfectly within its world. However, what Episode I did acheive, is a perfect lead-in story. It gives us the opportunity to ask questions and have a reason to see if they will be resolved. All the questions we have about the Sith and the Jedi and the republic will be answered and when that happens we will look back at Episode I and say 'Now I understand.'  Overall I liked the Phantom Menace and it accomplished the one mission that George Lucas wanted to achieve.. and that's to leave us thirsting for Episode II and III. I know that there are alot of questions I would like to see answered, and I'm sure that George Lucas will not disappoint.",8,0,0,24 June 1999
The Usual Suspects," One of the best films of all time
","When I saw the first part of The Usual Suspects, I thought it was just another crime film with good direction. I was waiting for that little extra bite that would separate it from any other film I had seen. Well needless to say, at the end, I was not disappointed. I am the type of person when after I see a movie, I think of things I would have done in the direction and screenplay to make it better. When I saw this film I was in awe. I couldn't think of anything. This was the perfect film. Perfect acting. Perfect screenplay. The perfect plot. An excellent performance by Kevin Spacey. It is a wonder how films can not be made with this originality and ingenious freshness of this film. For anyone who has not seen this film, I will not say anything that would give away any of its plot. But what I will say is that this movie will open your mind and will leave you staring at the credits when the movie is over with your mouth gaping, while you are thinking about what the director just pulled over your eyes and how blind you really were during the whole movie.",10,0,1,2 July 1999
Kingpin," Not Bad
","Not the funniest Farelly brothers movie.. but it did have the best line. Woody says,'I milked your cow this morning and it took her a while to get her started but once she did, she wouldn't stop.' The Amish guy looks at Woody and says 'We don't have a cow.. that's a bull.' I am still laughing from that line. Classic.. purely classic.",6,0,1,14 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best there is and ever will be....
","Every time I watch this movie, I am astounded. George Lucas created such a smart movie with amazing special effects for his time, for anytime. It has everything a film should have. Comedy, drama, action, adventure, romance.. I am so amazed at the way we learn so much about the characters and understand them as human beings. The way that a farm boy grew up and had to save the galaxy from his father was an ingenious plot. Having to chose from good which meant denying his father or evil which meant staying loyal to his blood. Star Wars is more than a movie, it is a cinematic event. When we see the prequels, it will make us enjoy this movie and its sequels so much more. 7 out of 7 stars for this well made motion picture.",10,0,0,13 January 1999
