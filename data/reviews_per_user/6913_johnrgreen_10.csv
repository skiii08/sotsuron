The Sound of Music," Schmaltz with added cheese
","From '16 going on 17' being straight out of The Producers(,Mel Brooks must be been watching),to the 'whiskers on kittens' dross, this is feelgood writ large. By the end I was crying out for those poor little aristos to be captured and the goodness to be tortured out of them.In between ,stern Capt fell in love with the patron saint of wholesomeness over the sexy Baroness ,a most unlikely outcome although we should have guessed.I mean,his righteous position on impending Nazism for instance.The triumph of good over evil.With added tunes.",4,0,6,2 January 2020
The Adjustment Bureau," old hat-trick
","It must have been one of Dick's off days when he dreamt this up.A religious parable and a plot with more holes than Blackburn,Lancashire. The whole thing seemed to be reliant on a hatwearer showing human emotions.He falls asleep;he lends our hero his hat! However the leading couple in the film give strong performances.Blunt is a good actress and has charisma.She's not the usual x-ray lead and can carry a bad film,even the cringy dancing section.Matt Damon too,is solid.Stamp's character should have been more menacing and wasn't and so they bought in the man from Madmen the go-to guy for hat wearing roles.I was intrigued as to how they would resolve this pile of baloney but unfortunately a man in a hat determined that my fate line went directly to the pub instead.",3,1,1,24 June 2014
Cold War," black and white in a grey europe.
","Limited to under 90' the story is pared down to episodic trysts and rather beautiful music and dancing.So although it is great to watch at times it hasn't the haunting quality that remains with the viewer.I sat with my fellow viewers after and spoke of many things but not the film.Which is a shame as the director, I'm sure, wanted to instil the sense of desperation that would drive the two on/off lovers to end it all,together.I don't think he achieved that.",6,22,39,1 October 2018
Friends with Benefits," Come back Cary Grant,we miss you.
","If this film has any merit at all it should really end Hollywood making romcoms.It won't.I'm sure it was a hit with the under 30 pop fans etc who aren't so bothered about vulgarity.
However I thought it was badly directed and acted.It has an incomprehensible script with in-jokes about the music and was full of clichÃ©s and stereotypes.. Lines were spewed out without meaning.If these two leads are actors I am George Cukor,spinning away in his grave.
The scene when they decide to practice on each other was vulgar beyond belief and robotically and mirthlessly 'acted.'
Toe-curling stuff such as when the lead male takes the lead female to meet his family(why?) and they were uniformly kerazy and/or damaged and the sister has the old romcom friend /relation ''but you're so good for each other'' line and.Alzheimer Dad(disease du jour)takes his trousers off in a restaurant and then so does his son.To show solidarity of course and show his pert bum no doubt.So many pointless characters and clichÃ©s that I can't possibly mention them all.An honourable mention though to the lead 's mother who surpassed herself in the obligatory role of the sex-starved relative.She walks in on them at it, a bona fide classic of tastelessness.If 'Bringing Up Baby' is the zenith of romcoms then this film is burrowing its way to the earth's core.",Null,0,1,16 February 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," out of this world.
","I remember stumbling out of the North Cheam Granada in 68/9, my 14 year old mind working overtime trying to comprehend what I had just seen,I didn't feel so emotional about a film apart from Apocalypse Now and everything I saw as a child.Now look, not everybody likes this film and I can't comment about the philosophical meanings.I think I read the novel or novella but to no avail.Last night I saw it again and it didn't seem too long,boring or pretentious.The 2 hours plus flew by.The music and the imagery were just incredible.The drama between the recalcitrant HAL and ''D a y y v e'' beautifully done.The best Leonard Rossiter vehicle I've ever seen.",9,1,3,2 April 2019
La La Land," Charming but slight.
","Starting with a bargain basement Busby Berkeley traffic-jam dance routine and ending with two alternative finishes.A what if and a what really.
The weaknesses are the songs and the singers ,which is a fair part of the film.Its strengths such as they are is the chemistry of the leading pair and for a while the plot trajectory. It putters out over two competing ambitions.His purist jazz obsession,predictably,at odds with her acting and writing.Wouldn't you know it but simultaneous achieving of both signals the end and a five year leap into the future and another coincidental path crossing where our heroine imagines life with him if she had stayed.Big mistake! She'll be back!",7,0,0,7 October 2019
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," I put a spell on you......
","I like the films and if I have one criticism, there's rather too much plot standby like' it's Thingummy all along' as one character morphs into someone else so you have to recalibrate all you've seen to factor in .....Who am I kidding?! Never having read the books apart from a chapter to my nephew years ago at bedtime and scared him,so he said,I dont have prior knowledge and well it's witchcraft innit so all reality is binned and anything can happen despite at its core,a kind of restrained version of St Trinians,with most of its characters middle class and despite an enormous suspension of disbelief, respectful old buffers who just happen to be carrying wands.Add to that some impressive baddies and the sweet friendship between the front three and you have a hit.All done without Judy Dench,
Wizard!",6,1,1,31 October 2019
Prometheus," Alien corn
","I admire Ridley Scott as he is responsible for the brilliant GOOD WIFE and so approached this film with not a little optimism.After all ALIEN is a wonderful,tense film.Like a science fiction version of a ghost story,woman in peril and locked house thriller,it's up there with the greats.By opening up that story I am afraid he has let light in on the magic. I agree with all the knockers of this film.This is a stinker.It has complete lack of tension,improbable characters and plot.I laughed heartily at the kamikaze crew cheerily driving their craft into the alien ship,like medieval knights intent on a pointless but noble end. .The expensive sets notwithstanding perhaps that expense should have gone on a better script and on the old geezer's make up..Bring back John Hurt!",2,2,4,31 May 2015
Spectre," Feel Spectre's Wall of un-sound
","An entertaining film with a leaky plot.I'm no Bond films expert as you will see but I didn't buy all the ,Blofeld is Bond's cuckoo brother business ,and M being pushed out by tech-savvy Moriarty who's in with SPECTRE(M was looking the other way when that happened). Bond had to be reminded who SPECTRE were(well,he is in his nineties) and when he was in the black straight jacket how did he get the gun? I should have had another look but couldn't be bothered.Q is now a rather camp young man who also gets out of awkward situations and travels with ease but looks like he couldn't knock the skin off a rice pudding.
 Bond is in incredible nick for a 90-something year old.He's still able to have sex and run around like 30 year old, beating off,so to speak,huge henchmen and super-villains alike.Then again he doesn't smoke or drink much.",5,0,4,27 August 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Repetetive and boring.
",I don't think those of a gentler disposition would be attracted to the relentless heavy metal/steampunk chase element of this film(this element constitutes about 97%).That I stuck it out to the end had more to do with my fast forward button.It is not a dystopian masterpiece.It is entirely informed by mind-rotting apocalyptic video games.,2,4,10,8 December 2018
