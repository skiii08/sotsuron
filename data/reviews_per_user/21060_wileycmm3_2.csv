Moneyball," Was skeptical about this movie but was pleasantly surprised.
","Wow this movie is unlike anything I expected. When I saw the trailer and read the plot I figured that it would be another one of those boring old sports movies that the world has too many of. The movie had great character development, and plenty of emotional moments. Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt put forward fantastic performances. The directing and editing also were great. The movie was very entertaining and kept me rooted to my seat. I think that it had a familiar vibe to the film hoosiers, and a somewhat similar storyline so I guess that this kind of movie has been done before. But it still felt like a totally different film despite the similarities. Jonah hill had a particullarly great performance before watching this film I had him pegged as the comedy-type actor, but upon seeing this movie my opinion has completely changed I now see that he could probably do any genre. Overall a good movie somewhat predictable but still a standout you should definitely go see.",8,1,2,22 August 2014
Sin City," Fantastic
","This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. The visuals are stunning, the action is adrenaline pumping, its dark, and it is perfectly formatted from graphic novel to film. I am a huge film noir fan and have always been looking for the film that would suit my preferences, and I think that this movie is the one that does it. The actors play their roles from the comic perfectly(especially Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba). For anyone that hasn't seen it be warned, the film is broken up into four different stories, so when the credits start rolling on one of them do not get up and leave the movie is far from over. I'm not going to spoil any of the stories though. Overall this movie is fantastic, it is unique and perfectly adapted from Frank Millers stories. This is not just a movie based on a graphic novel it is a graphic novel made to look similar to a movie thats how good of an adaption it truly is. I suggest to anyone who has not seen it to go rent it or download it immediately because this movie is amazing.",10,1,3,5 January 2015
