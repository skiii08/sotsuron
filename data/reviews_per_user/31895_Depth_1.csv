Requiem for a Dream," Wow!...stunning, amazing, powerful.
","It is by far the best film I'm seen in a long time. I spend the rest of the evening saying little more than, 'Wow' over and over. It's an absolutely amazing film. It's rare that I applaud a particular actor for a stunning performance. Yet, Ellen Burstyn was fantastic. This film makes me think back at the films this year that I've seen and thought they were great. Now, they seem like such lifeless pale shadows. I can't say enough good things about it. See it, but not with your kids...unless they are teenagers, in which case, definitely make sure they watch it. I habitually avoid sad or depressing films. I figure life is sad enough as it so why wallow in it? Oddly, even though this movie is almost nothing happy about it, I recommend it to everyone. It is a powerful film. The music, visual affects, acting, dialogue, and story all come together in a beautiful, stunning, moving, and compelling arrangement that is more than a message, it is ART. 10/10",Null,0,1,20 January 2004
