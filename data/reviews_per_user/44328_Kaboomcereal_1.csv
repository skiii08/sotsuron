Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Revenge is a forest
","At the end of Kill Bill 1, Hattori Hanzo is quoted, telling the Bride that she can get lost on the way to her revenge. This fantastic sequel shows that with its winding pathways. Her encounters with the rest of the Deadly Viper Assination Squad is different from the first movie in the saga. She acts upon different whims. Budd's character is complex for his position in the story. As she comes to face her adversaries, her actions change and the reasons change.By the end of the movie, with possibly the best quote from movies I've seen (those who've watched know what it is), The Bride is turned into somebody else. The last scene after the credits show perfectly the transformation of Quentin and Uma's character, The Bride.",10,2,4,6 August 2005
