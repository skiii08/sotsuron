The Avengers," The ending is spoiled on the trailer!!!
","So, I watched the trailer for 'The Avengers'. It has Loki bragging he has an army, to which Tony Stark/Iron Man replies that they have The Hulk...I supposed that, maybe, if I didn't know absolutely anything about The Hulk from the comics, I wouldn't have predicted the ending of the film with that. I mean, they had The Hulk... So what? Considering the cool and calm way Mr. Stark said that, I could conclude that he thought (or, more likely, had it for granted) that the so-called 'Hulk' was so powerful that anything, even a whole army, thrown on it wouldn't even tickle. It just happens that's the case in the film.Unlike most superheroes, The Hulk has no Achilles Heel (apart from himself). The more things you throw on The Hulk, the stronger he becomes, infinitely and exponentially. That piece of information is not presented on this film, as far as I can remember (and not even in any of The Hulk films, but I don't remember most of them, so I can't be sure), but it wasn't necessary. The morons that cut that trailer should have known better than to put that Robert 'Tony' Downey 'Stark' Jr.'s one-liner on the it. Yes, it spoiled the ending for me, and no, I didn't watch the trailer on purpose, it was shown when I went to the theatre to watch something else (I was so shocked by the spoiling trailer that I can't even remember what I went to watch, then).This film is boring, uninspired, over-hyped, so badly scripted/plotted that it can't even be called 'pretentious' (is that good or bad, for a film of this genre?!) and the visual effects are so exaggerated that everything looks fake. Even so, it has one of the best lines of all superheroes films I've seen. It comes like this, the film starts, there is a lot of boring/annoying bla-bla-blah and, after Mr. Stark tells Loki that they have The Hulk, Bruce Banner reappears, someone says him that it would be good if he could get angry, to which Dr. Banner replies... Sorry, even with 'spoilers on', I can't force myself to tell you this. If you don't want to watch this film (if I hadn't, I wouldn't, believe me, it's really that boring), go to a search engine site and look for 'The Avengers Hulk angry secret' and watch a clip of the scene, because it's THE ONLY piece of all of it that is worth watching. I can't say that that alone would be worth the price of admission, but it surely put a smile on my bored face.10 stars for Dr. Bruce Banner's one line, -7 for all the rest.",1,1,1,23 June 2017
Cloverfield," Eastern Movie Remake mixed with Blair Witch
","This movie is a kind of remake of 'Gwoemul' (a.k.a. 'The Host', 2006 Korean movie), mixed with the 'shaky camera' from 'Blair Witch'. The main difference is the size of the monster. Gwoemul's monster is about the size of a cargo van, so it 'interacts' with humans directly. Cloverfield's monster is Godzilla sized, but don't worry, the plot brings up an excuse to force an interaction with the human victims.The second greatest difference is on camera direction. 'Gwoemul' uses a conventional camera style, while 'Cloverfield' uses the 'field documentary' kind of filming, as seen on movies like 'Blair Witch', '(REC)' and the remake of 'Battlestar Galactica' TV series. The obvious problem on this approach is that the director needs an excuse to keep filming, even when it's very unlikely that the character with the camera would do so (or have the means to keep recording or to get the best angles). On 'Blair Witch', the characters wanted to keep a record for whomever would find their corpses, in case they didn't survive. '(REC)' had probably the best excuse of all, the character was a professional cameraman, working for a news channel, so he had all reasons to keep filming, even when his life was at stake (as seen in actual war documentaries, for example). 'Battlestar Galactica' had no reason at all to use 'shaky camera', they did so to mask the poor acting/action and bad visual effects, mainly on the first seasons. 'Cloverfield' solved that by putting the camera on the hands of the kind of person that make you wonder if he's on drugs or suffered a brain damaging accident. Because of such lame excuse, about half of the scenes on this movie make absolutely no sense. I mean, someone running for its life, don't matter how idiot it is, wouldn't keep a camcorder at eye level to record its friends' escape from death (much less point the camera backward to record the monster coming after them!) Other plot details from 'Gwoemul' were adapted to 'Cloverfield', like the 'problem' that happens when someone is bitten or scratched by a monster (and exactly like on the former, it is completely left undeveloped, such a waste!) The endings are also very similar, although with different technological approaches.Finally, similarly to 'Gwoemul', 'Cloverfield' doesn't bother to explain its title. Of course, there are lots of out-of-the-movie explanations, but no one coming from the movie itself.I managed to watch this once, but never again. Another Western remake of an Eastern movie, with an irritating camera style and underdeveloped plot (not that the former had much of a development, to begin with...)The (few) visual effects are well done, but it is a dark night scenario, I'm not sure it would look so good at daylight (as it does on 'Gwoemul'). It almost makes me want to raise my rating on 'Gwoemul'...",1,2,3,14 February 2010
Silent Hill," Must Have an Extended Version!
","It's hard to write about this movie, because the reaction to it depends somewhat on having or not played the games. This movie is based on Konami's 'Silent Hill' series of games, mainly on the first, with elements of the second. Some people that have played the games seem to have failed to realize that, expecting to see a 'film version' of the first game, what this movie is not! SH is based on the games, not converted from them, fortunately. The only complaint I have about this movie is that it is too short, the plot is too complex for a two-hours movie, some scenes could be expanded and some speeches slowed down (with longer background sequences).The characters are mostly from the first game, the others are originals. Their development is much better than in the game, mostly because the characters wander alone in the first game. In the movie, the characters stay together most of the time (it's not 'Scooby-doo', they do not separate when things get rough...) The actors also play very well their roles, mainly the little girl. Pay attention to her eyes, they tell more about the story than is actually said.One thing that is preserved from the games (and even enhanced) is the background, the 'something-scary-is-coming' atmosphere. If the movie was longer, some elements of the games that appear in the movie could have been better used, but that doesn't make the movie less enjoyable.And after watching the movie, I realized something that is not so obvious in the games: humans are the real monsters (and I don't mean only in the games/movies!) The demons stalking in Silent Hill don't compare in evilness to the humans hiding there! If you can't cope with violence in movies, especially in this one, then don't read the morning newspapers, lock the doors and stay in bed... And once you are at it, play 'Silent Hill', the game, it has not one, but TWO different 'happy endings'! Real life is not so merciful...",10,10,17,20 February 2007
Moana," Bad Message on Parenthood
","Unlike 'Bolt' and 'Zootopia', Disney tried again another musical, i.e., people singing instead of talking. That apart, unlike other Disney musicals, e.g., 'Mulan' and 'Tangled', the songs in this film are very repetitive. I lost count of how many time the main character's song is reprised, with maybe slightly different lyrics every time, but I stopped caring after the second one. The explorer's song, one of the few with Polynesian language thrown-in and that doesn't sound like a cheap Western European cartoon musical, is somewhat 'fine', although also repeated unnecessarily too many times. Maui's and Tamatoa's songs are happily jazzy and unfitting with the film, but helped me to survive till the obvious ending.Yes, the ending is squarely obvious after the first few minutes, just after the story of Maui's deed is told. The producers tried to make it less obvious by hiding the spiral on Te Ka's chest, but it's a Disney cartoon, who couldn't tell that Maui would come back to help (actually, who couldn't tell he would eventually ditch Moana in the worst possible situation, just to raise the 'thrill'?), who couldn't tell that it would be Moana to fix everything (and not Maui, despite all his godly powers), who couldn't tell that it would have a perfectly colossal happy ending...?! Even the only character to die returns Obi-Wan-Kenobilistically to help Moana (what just makes sense, I guess, as Disney now owns the Star Wars franchise). Seriously, spoilers? Disney created a type of film which makes all spoilers simply meaningless (like, who couldn't tell the ending of 'Frozen' just by seen the poster, with the two sisters side by side?) Granted happy ending is not fun, at all (and no, watching 'how' the characters get there is not enough nowadays for enjoyment, this is not opera, this is cinema).Maui is by far the best character, but just like Indiana Jones in 'Raiders of The Lost Ark', absolutely unimportant for the plot (except for stealing the heart of Tahiti, oops, 'Te Fiti', which any other unrelated character could have done, any and everything he did was useless to change the course of the story). Maui's self-conscious line asking Moana not to start singing was funny, but the fun vanished swiftly as the songs restarted filling up the space where actual story should be. I have to regard Heihei, the chicken, funny, although fully useless, too (don't worry, if it wasn't there, the stone would have fallen in the ocean, and it would have returned it to Moana, just like it did before).Why is Moana the main character? There was no need for the character to be female, unlike Mulan or Merida. For the plot, Moana could be a shrimp, it wouldn't make any difference. I guess Disney wants to sell more toys to girls, and that's all. According to psychologists, men have a need to outstand, women have a need to fit in (this is not Wikipedia, you look for the references!) Thus, boys take any crap you throw at them, as long as it has flashy LED's and makes a lot of noise. Girls are usually more picky, they use to choose what appeals to them somehow (even if only because 'everybody at school has one'). Heroines have a better chance to sell them anything, I suppose, so there comes another female leading character. Do you doubt it? Disney went as far as making Maui literally label Moana as a 'princess', what she vehemently denies, just to make it sink even deeper in the brains of the young. That's pure evil!Talking about evil, why are the parents always the evil people that don't let the heroine be, well, heroic (or even have a little fun)?! It had to be the fun-funny-and-cool, sweeter-than-honey, always friendly/compassionate, knowing-better-than-the-parents Grandmother the one to help Moana. Granny inflamed her desire to disobey her father's orders, which almost got herself drowned, what was exactly what he was trying to save her from (what is also completely nonsensical, as the ocean for far too many times saves her and others from drowning, to the point I stopped worrying that any character could die). That was a very evil message, that anyone can be a better friend than the parents. Sure, there are bad parents out there, but that was clearly not the case, as he was trying to protect her. Disney poisoning!The plot has so many holes (some of which I have already exposed) that the ending is almost detached from the rest of the film. For example, why didn't the ocean simply return the stone to Te Fiti, why did it need a human to do the job? Moana wouldn't be able to do it without the help of the ocean, which opened a path to Te Ka.The background message, 'don't mess with Nature', was weak, far below 'Mononoke Hime' or even 'Over The Hedge'. It's absolutely unbelievable that this film got such high scores. Those scores tell much more about the 'status quo' of contemporary society than the film's quality.Why do I bother coming here to blemish this film? Because it's an evil film, by an evil corporation, watched by too many children out there.",1,58,141,31 January 2017
Baby Driver," Never done before, except too many times...
","I really don't know if this is a spoiler, as the way I get it, everybody is going to watch this film because of this 'device': action on screen is synchronised with the soundtrack songs... And nobody have done that before... Oh, except they have, they even call it a name: 'musical' (and not only the ones in which people stop talking to start singing, like 'Singing in The Rain', but also those in which the music is a fundamental part of the story, like 'Saturday Night Fever'...) And before that, there was something called 'dance', but that's not the subject here. Of course, some could argue that it's a non-musical film with synchronised action to music... Once again, it's been done before, like the Diva's on-stage performance matching Leeloo's fight in a hotel room in 'The Fifth Element', or the EVE and WALL-E open-space maneuvers in Pixar's 'WALL-E'...There are no twists (worth it, I mean), there is a granted happy ending (but then again, everybody could tell that from the trailer alone, that's no spoiler, really), and a bad guy (with a stupid name) to whom people should sympathise, except that he's too dumb for that.The car chases are better than those from any of 'The TransFormers' franchise, but I'm not sure it's a fair comparison (choreographed lame chases versus computer generated physical-laws-ignoring graphics...)I have to say, I was really surprised to see such high rating on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Either they developed a much better voting bot, or people are getting way dumber than the films they are watching...",1,63,122,12 September 2017
Frozen," Let It Blow...
","Aside from being able to tell the ending of the film just by seeing the poster (the sisters side-by-side), I knew it was another animated musical from Disney (because the featured 'Let It Go' song just didn't stop playing everywhere), so I had my expectations as low as could be when I watched it... And even so, it managed to be even worse than I was prepared it to be.The main character is Elsa, who should be based on Andersen's Snow Queen, but turns out to be more like one of Marvel's X-Men with godly powers. She can create matter by will out of nowhere, i.e., she produces ice without needing water, so she could pretty much destroy the whole universe by stacking up ice until the gravity would exceed that of the original singularity! Not enough? Of course not, she can also create LIFE, and not just any life, conscious and persistent lifeforms (remember, the snowman is THE SAME snowman every winter, so its consciousness obviously is able to exist throughout eternity, so even if it is not indestructible, as it can be melted down, its mind still stands and, given enough time, it would eventually return, the feat of a demigod, at least). Granted, the creatures are not the brightest LED lamps on the market, but, come on, she's just beginning to test her powers. More over, her powers are unlimited, she can cool down things without spending energy, i.e., she can revert entropy, she could 'reboot' the universe itself! Very few characters in the scope of Marvel, DC or any other comic book publisher has been created so powerful... And despite all that powers, she's unable to handle a bunch of invading soldiers, in her castle, armed with pikes and swords?! Sure...The X-Woman has a sister, 'Easy Anna', who has the superpower of being extra 'easy', unlike her 'no one was getting anywhere with her' sibling (yeah, stated literally like that on film). She can fall in love at first sight with any man crossing her way. Be careful, because she also sings, cheesy and badly, like she's in a cabaret, or worse. 'For The First Time in Forever' is an irking ode to adolescence's boiling hormones. Of course, she eventually manages to fall in love with a misogynous prince and kind of gets herself cursed (it seems the X-Elsa is also able to cast icy curses, even unwillingly, what is maybe the closest to Andersen's original plot that they managed to get).The rest is a wild ride of plot holes. For example, Elsa comes full fledged with Advanced Mathematics knowledge, being able not only to raise up a castle of pure ice (cf. Superman's Solitude Fortress), but to sing about 'frozen fractals', all around. Even so, her people seem to be unable to build a wooden snow sledge that doesn't EXPLODE in the event of falling a few metres down a cliff... I mean, it was made of WOOD and blew up like it was carrying Napalm (what maybe it was, we don't actually know anything about Kristoff, he could be on Interpol's wanted list!)Talking about nonsense, why the ice started growing INSIDE the castle, chasing Easy Anna out, but stopped doing so outside, where it was surely much colder? If it was part of the curse, that was a very specific instalment. I mean, the ice shall grow around to kill her, but only in case she's in a castle...? Maybe it was just coincidence, the whole castle could be freezing, because the whole world was cooling down, but then again, it really looked colder outside than inside and I couldn't see much ice growing where Easy Anna was not, in that castle... Does any of that make any sense, at all...?And what was that about the sisters' childhood? So, one sister hurts the other while playing, so their parents take them apart, and erase one's memories?! Damn, why didn't I think of that when MY daughters hurt each other?! I mean, sure, it was an accident, but I could raise them apart, just to make sure they would never hurt themselves again. It's easier than trying to teach them to be nice and better persons. Makes sense, totally... What doesn't make sense is why Easy Anna didn't refreeze when she found out about her erased memories, if that was part of the treat (or 'treatment') the trolls used on her... I think they just got 'trolled'!All in all, this show is a bad example in parenting and how logic doesn't fit in a Disney film. It's also a moral lesson on the dangers of young women being 'too cold' or 'too easy'... Could it get any more sexist than that? Big hit by Disney, two princesses in one film. The only up side on it is 'Let It Go', because it's likely the most exploitable song, ever! Let it blow, let it blow, like a sledge down the sno-oh-ow...",1,8,16,10 February 2017
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Boredoom unleashed
","I was told this was a classic film. As a classic, I expected it to be either aside from the mainstream or defining of a genre. It manages to be both, actually. It is definitely not mainstream, because of the subject portrayed and the way it is shown. It also defines a genre that is, also definitely, not part of the mainstream (somewhat, luckily).'Salo' is about a group of perverts (male and female) that exploits the Nazi-Fascist war machine to kidnap, torture and kill young people... And that's all. It has no plot, it's just a portrait. There is no character development, there is no story whatsoever and there is no point of anything for any reason.There is a lot of background story (and History) behind the scenes, but not a single drop of it is put on screen. If an alien civilisation picked this film to watch, without knowing anything about WWII, they wouldn't understand anything shown (except, maybe, that the human species is one of the dumbest in the whole universe, eating their faeces and killing their youngsters for nothing, not even for the fun of it).It's amazingly boring, slow paced and pointless in everything. The villains have no motivation other than sexual and murderous drive to act, and they act absolutely randomly along the whole film. Every time one of the victims die, they mock the survivors by counting them, making one believe that there will be some kind of 'whatever' when the count goes down to one, but that never happens, as the film runtime just ends and everybody left is taken outside to be tortured and slaughtered. Considering that on the previous scenes the victims were forced to eat and bathe in faeces, I guess dying was actually a happy ending! It plays like a mockumentary or a stupid video clip. The acting is terrible, both on the villains' and on the victims' side, some of them can't even hide a smile while they are being oppressed (as there is no background story on screen, at first it made me think they were playing some kind of game, before the film's beginning).And when you think it's finally over and that it cannot get any worse, the film cuts to two young Nazi soldiers, who join hands and start dancing... So, the message is, Nazis are are people, too, and can love (each other, at least) like everybody else does...?! 'Salo' is not only boring, it's pretentious, amateurishly scripted and devoid of any enjoyable content, unless you are a hardcore fan of coprophagy (oh no, at least, it's fake).",1,1,9,22 June 2017
Pulp Fiction," Another 'Yucky' Tarantino
","In one word: boring.Get the comments people make about this movie. You have those that say it's 'innovative and controversial', others that it's 'violent and refreshing', others that say it's a 'rebellious masterpiece'. Yes, you can check it out, absolutely all comments fall into such kind of comments. Why? I have a theory: those guys have NEVER watched a good movie. And I mean it! Violence? Gosh, this movie was only less boring than 'Natural Born Killers', the worst movie ever made (don't worry, I have a 'good' comment prepared for that crap, also).There is only one really violent scene in the whole movie, when the pervert binds the boxer Bruce (and the other guy I can't even remember who was) and prepares to torture them. I can't remember if he actually does torture them, but that's absolutely irrelevant, the situation the characters are put into is what really matter. And Bruce choosing the sword when he escapes, oh my, that was really nice (the only good moment in the whole movie). Wanna see lots of fake blood, watch 'Happy Tree Friends'! But do you want true violence, watch 'Spoorloos'. Paraphrasing it, if you think killing is the worst thing somebody can do, you haven't seen anything yet!It's absolutely amazing that crimes like rape and kidnapping are considered less severe than a murder in our 'civilization'. Okay, a murder is terrible, but nothing compares to the suffering of those that survive (not only the victims, but also those around them...)'Pulp Fiction' is about terminating people without a good reason, nothing more. I see no violence in some idiot blowing up a nameless character's head (MTv's Movie Awards parody of the car scene was excellent, they really got the idea!!!) This movie only shows more fake blood than most 'hollywoodian' movies, but what's the point? If it created a revolution in Cinema, it was to make it 'yuckier'... I have seen much more blood in 'Hellraiser', which, by the way, has blood AND violence! All Tarantino's movies are too shallow to show true violence...Too bad IMDb doesn't allow voting zero for a movie...",1,22,50,23 March 2005
Titanic," The Second Worst Movie Ever
","The first time I commented on this movie, I gave it a really harsh review. Since then, nothing has changed, but I'm going easier this time.Two titles come to mind when reviewing it: 'Natural Born Killers' (NBK) and 'Gone with The Wind' (GwTW). Till 'Titanic', the worst and the second worst movies I've ever seen. NBK is by far the worst. It has an excellent director, a good writer, good to very good actors and, even so, it managed to be completely empty, with some spectacular sequences gone completely to waste in meaningless situations (like the wonderful gray-scale prison sequence). GwTW is another meaningless work, but it never had any chance, with terrible speeches, a director that didn't know what he was doing and a story that would have thrown it into oblivion if it was not settle in the American civil war (it has some 'historical value', or so I was told).Back to 'Titanic', the first obvious problem is the plot. At one side, there is this young lady, about to get married to a rich man, an educated pig, but still a pig. On the other side, there is that young man, handsome, good-hearted and a gifted artist. The only problem is that the young artist is poor, but, mind you, the lady is rich already! It was absolutely impossible for her to not fall in love with the artist. The only conflict possible is the jealousy of the rich man against the poor artist. Predictable, to say the least. Then, when everybody have fallen for the new happy couple, the ship sinks. I'm absolutely sure that people wouldn't have cried so much if everybody had died. The whole story is extremely predictable. Worse, it is made predictable.How did 'Titanic' take the second place from GwTW? Well, it took a lot of cash to do that... Cameron wanted a real sized ship to be able to effectively send it to the bottom. Fine, it's not my money. Then we see the result on the big screen, and now it is our money! Since 'Indiana Jones 3', I hadn't seen such a lousy chroma-key. When you see the passengers falling into the sea, it looks like they were filmed against a projection, like in the original 'King Solomon's Mines' movie. That alone, I wouldn't have minded so much. Then you watch Cameron commenting on the box-office success of 'Titanic' and his claim that it was due to his attention to details... Even if that statement was true, there is one more problem: the big things are all wrong, why care about the details?It was not easy to put the about four hours 'Gone with The Wind' on third place, but Cameron made it possible in about three hours. He has a talent for blockbusters, it's too bad he cannot also make them good movies.",1,3,10,7 April 2005
The Matrix," A Movie with Different Layers
","Like 'Blade Runner', the 'Matrix' trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.If you liked this movie more than the sequel, 'Matrix: Reloaded', then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the 'Matrix' trilogy always talk about the 'shallow story' and the 'cheap philosophy'. As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The 'pseudo-philosophic junk' is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, 'The Matrix' is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.The key to realize the greatness of the 'Matrix' trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in 'Reloaded', it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in 'Matrix: Revolutions', don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the 'Matrix' trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of 'cool', but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment.",10,6,13,13 August 2008
Life," Obvious ending
","This film is often compared to Ridley Scott's 'Alien', what to some may be a spoiler, but to all others, it's just like saying that it's a space creature story, what is exactly what people that go watch this kind of show are seeking, anyway. The title is actually spoiler enough, pointing that there is 'Life' out there.The plot has many problems, starting from the creature concept: it begins as a single cell that can multiply and form a multicellular being, in which each cell keeps its individuality, to the point each cell can see, think and act independently, mostly like John Carpenter's 'The Thing', except that it/they doesn't/don't, i.e., the creature never splits (it could have left a single cell behind to consume each person it killed, for example, so there would be half a dozen creatures at the end, instead of just one, increasing its/their chance of survival). That feature of the creature is never used, not even once (although, to be fair, the idea haunts the film, making us think that everybody and/or everything the creature touched could host a new creature).The characters are amazingly dumb, poking the alien with an electric probe, opening doors when the whole section should be shut, using fire (in the space station!) to try to kill the alien, getting alone when a deadly alien is loose and hunting and so on.There are also problems regarding the Science behind the Fiction, like why is the creature intolerant to oxygen at first, then without explanation becomes an oxygen 'vampire'? The creature's driving goal also changes randomly, some times it's after 'food' (anything carbon based, even coolant), other times it's after air, on other times, droplets of blood...There are also Engineering problems, like how did the creature return into the station, to attack the scientist's leg, without breaching air out (and engaging all kinds of alarms)? Also, why did the gauges move when the creature supposedly tried to invade the propulsion exhausts (to eat the fuel), while they were shut? Finally, the ending became too obvious when the two last survivors started plotting two different paths of action for them. I think it would have gone better if the pilot had kept his plan secret until the very last moment, so the twist wouldn't be spoiled so long before the ending.On the plus side, the cast is good, so the acting is convincing (yeah, they manage to convince that they are all very dumb, but they do that really convincingly!), and the music score is nice, adding a lot to what's happening on screen, giving a really menacing 'feel' to the mostly faceless creature.Everything considered, this is more 'space opera' than properly Science Fiction, but then again, that's the case with most films classified as such, including 'Alien' and 'The Thing', what doesn't make them less entertaining. As a thriller, this film delivers a few good moments, just don't think too much about hows and whys (if you do, you will probably hate it).",5,4,9,3 June 2017
