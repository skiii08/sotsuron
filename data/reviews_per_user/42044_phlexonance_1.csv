Skyfall," What's more absurd, that they keep making the same movie or that I keep watching and expect the latest one to be something more?
","Within the first half hour, the movie promised to be something more than the previous Bond movies.Is Bond getting too old for his job? Would he remain hidden in exile or return to a thankless job? Is M too ruthless? Are agents really necessary in a digital world?All of those questions were raised, but not answered.Instead, they spent time on the regular James Bond routine: average dialogue, supposedly witty; action scenes with an immortal protagonist; tropes, lots of tropes.At least this movie made due without the ever increasingly more ridiculous miracle gadgets.Javier Bardem makes for a good villain, even though he appears to be more or less a copy of The Joker.",6,1,5,10 February 2013
