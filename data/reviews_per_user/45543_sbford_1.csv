The Legend of Bagger Vance," Hit or Miss?
","Whether or not this movie was a hit or miss lies entirely on the person. This movie isn't for those who are looking for some kind of mystery, some kind of puzzle, or something to figure out to make them feel more intelligent for understanding what others might not.  Rather, this movie is about inspiring people to deal with their faults and to live a life to the fullest.  Could be a chic flick, but the chicks I saw it with weren't that impressed with it.  So I don't know what type of audience this movie is for... but give it a try.  It's in the top 10 greatest movies of all time for me.  Also, the score for Baggar Vance is one to be noted... orchestral arrangments were awesome.",Null,1,3,23 March 2003
