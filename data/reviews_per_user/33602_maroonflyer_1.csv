Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," I am really impressed with this movie!
",Sherlock Holmes has always interested me. I saw the first Sherlock Holmes movie and I really enjoyed it. When I read that this movie was coming out I was really pleased because I liked the first one. I'm sure you already know the plot so I'm not going to summarize it but this movie has a great plot and a twist at the end. The last few seconds of the movie really made me excited. I can really see how this movie has a potential for another movie. At some points this movie can be kind of hard to understand but you can put the pieces together and understand the plot. I also really like Professor Moriarty's character a lot. You can tell that Watson and Holmes are really good friends by their humor and the hard times they give each other. I would suggest this movie to someone else.,7,1,2,31 December 2011
