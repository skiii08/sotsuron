Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Couldn't recognize it as original star wars
","In short: this movie was made for kids. SMALL kids. Dialogue was bad. Not as bad as in Episode II but still bad. What about the film itself? I compare it to bad modern computer games: it's all FX, nothing else. Except that those computer games are more interesting, because they are interactive. Sure, I liked Darth Maul's character, but about everything else was far from original trilogy. Oh, I did like the scenery too.",5,0,1,16 May 2002
