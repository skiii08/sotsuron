Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An incredible movie
","This movie was incredible!   I'm not gonna say that it's the best movie I have ever seen, but it will not disappoint...  When going to see it, don't expect everything to be solved and every question answered.  It does answer some questions, but it also poses others.  All it is is an introduction and set-up for what's to come.  Don't expect anything more.  This is an awesome movie, and the more I watch it, the more I can't wait for Episodes 2 and 3...  It's definitely worth watching.  The true Star Wars fan will enjoy it.",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
