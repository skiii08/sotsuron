Spartacus," Just good.
",It was a good movie but I think i am to used of the movies and graphics this day that I can not watch this normally. The music and the effect were annoying and it had a abnormally long intro. I believe it was a great movie then!,Null,1,5,28 June 2019

The Lion King," My all time favourite!
","I love this movie! I've grown upcwith this, I watched a 1000 times then and still watch it now!The only thing I don't get is that they cast different singing voice actors. Only Scarvand Zazu have the same voices when they sing and talk.",10,0,0,25 February 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," I do not know what I just watched...
","One thing must be certain, you have to be a very professional actor tobplay Christian or Ana and not burstvout into laughter while playing them.. Jamie is a very good actor and he seems very funny but... in this movie everytime he speaks it makes me cringe, my god. I only watched these movies because I never did before and I was curious but I will never watch those again.",Null,0,2,22 February 2020
