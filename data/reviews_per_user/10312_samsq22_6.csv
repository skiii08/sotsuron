Casablanca," War-time Romance
","Casablanca cannot be fully appreciated until its audiences realize just how much it relates to history. Being one of this movie's audience members of today robs me of exactly what the feelings of society were when this movie came out. During my cinema history class, we discussed the significance of this film which served great importance. Although the movie had a bit of a dark view to it (well, it was in black and white) and it seemed a bit confusing at times, it was overall a great movie. I must admit, I did get a bit lost and I felt that the storyline tended to be a bit clear. However, this tale of a war-based romance is gripping and intriguing. The main character, Rick, faces huge life hurdlesÂ…including facing and finding his long lost love. It is a universal theme of abandoned love, with a historical twist of World War II. Overall, this wartime romance and adventure is worth the watch.",7,2,5,8 March 2012
Annie Hall," first Woody Allen move, but not my last.
","I really loved this movie! It was the first Woody Allen movie I have ever watched, but I'm sure it won't be my last. In the beginning I was skeptical with its slow pace and dry humor but as the movie progress I started to understand Woody Allen and his strange humor and directing. This film proved to me to be truly unique in every way. This romantic comedy can be relatable to basically anyone, with the main character's up and down relationship with women. Woody Allen really does an amazing job, taking a universal theme of a love story and twisting it up into many things. I might even go as far as saying that this movie is a mess, but as it ended, I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it.",8,0,0,10 May 2012
The Graduate," Daring and Hilarious
","The Graduate is a modern, hilarious, seductive movie of the 1960s that captures it's audience. I throughly enjoyed every aspect of this movie and it constantly had me cracking up laughing. It is daring and fun, not to much the amazing photography in it. Although I wasn't born anywhere near the 1960s, this movie gave me a feel for that era. The contemporary music just absolutely makes the movie and just wouldn't be the same without it. And I also cannot go without mentioning how amazing Anne Bancroft was in the film. I don't think anyone could've done a better job. In my opinion, The Graduate is a sexy, hilarious, and, at times, awkward movie that should be seen by all!",9,1,2,10 May 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Modern Musical
","Let me start out by saying that I absolutely loved his upbeat film! From the beginning, it is obvious that the underlying theme to this film is the ever-popular love story. However, Singin' in the Rain is a modern, colorful film with more to it. When their original movie that they are making goes down the drain, characters Dan and Cathy find a way to bring it to the top. Lena is downright dumb and hilarious at the same time. Her voice is anything but ordinary, which fits right in with this original movie. And so the film ends with the perfect demise of the enemy, Lena, and a show of modern dance, song and images. Great musical!",9,0,2,16 April 2012
Psycho," Thriller
","This rated R flick is probably one of the best horror movies I've seen. It is unusual, thrilling and suspenseful all in one. I definitely thought the shower scene was the best part, and I surely won't forget it.However, I think I agree with the rest of Psycho's audience by saying it is one of the most memorable scenes of all time.Hitchcock does an awesome job, in my opinion, with combining crime, sex and suspense, but that's nothing new. He takes an unreal and immortal topic to a realistic level. However, it is definitely not for the young ones! It's filled with blood and surprises but it's a definite must for those adult thrill seekers.",8,0,0,11 May 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicholson makes the movie
","This American Drama is definitely another history maker. It takes an unbelievable topic and turns it into a gripping story. A criminal who is sentenced to time in jail convinces everyone that he is indeed insane and therefore sent to a mental institution. He thinks it will be all comfy and cozy but he sure is in for a 'surprise. What's not interesting about that?! It causes the audience to love it even when it's wrong. It is outrageous but it works, mostly because of Jack Nicholson's wit. Nicholson's part really makes the movie, and although I haven't seen an overload of his movies, I think this is the best part he has played. The movie ends with a 'downer' but it works and life goes on.",8,0,1,11 May 2012
