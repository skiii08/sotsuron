The Blair Witch Project," Most disappointing movie ever, given the great trailers
","I thoroughly enjoyed the anticipation and mental picture of what to expect from this movie.  The actual movie didn't produce, unfortunately.  Great idea for a movie.  I wish I had thought of it.  Some day I hope a well produced and directed remake is done.  The sequels are even a fix to beat the original.",3,0,1,29 July 2000
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Think Jackass in Kazakstani
","Somebody has to say this...for the sake of honesty. If you have any class at all, stay home. This movie is sophomoric, boorish, and vulgar. The worst over-hyped movie since Blair Witch. First, the audience was not in any, much less hysterical, laughter mode like everyone here would have you believe. There was the occasional snicker, but mostly negative mumblings.Second, we don't find penis', naked guys wrestling, or feces funny...at least the way they were used in this movie.Third, the Jewish insults made it uncomfortable. No, we are not Jewish. Racial insults are a simply a thing of the past.But to be totally up front, I have to say that we walked out at about the 1 hour mark, so it is possible that Sasha saved all the humor for the end. Of course, having seen him on British TV, I wouldn't bet on it.",2,7,14,25 November 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An acquired taste
","Difficult to enjoy with others who are wrapped up in the supernatural martial arts combat or subtitles.  If that's you, set aside some time to watch it alone and you'll realize quickly that this movie has it all and belongs among one of the all-time greats.",9,0,0,8 January 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Unnecessarily long, but still excellent.
","Some movies really need more than 2 hours to develop their story. I think 'The Shawshank Redemption' would have been more successful if it was not so long.  The story is truly excellent...moving, intense, and joyous at the same time.  I think it could have been improved by editing out a few scenes which were redundant to the purpose of the mood they were establishing.",7,0,1,4 October 2000
The Matrix," No Sci-fi movie ever deserved a sequel more. Great plot and action.
","Gets better every time I watch it.  A mind boggling concept behind the plot. Sometimes I think about it and get the shivers.   Some of the action scenes are already classics for their originality and are being duplicated in other shows, TV and movies.  My favorite Keanu movie.",10,0,0,4 October 2000
