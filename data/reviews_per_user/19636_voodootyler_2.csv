Requiem for a Dream," Never before has a movie Move me so much
","I first saw Requiem in a small theatre, that is dedicated to showing foreign, and great films. When I walked into Requiem I knew nothing about it, only that it was the same director as 'Pi'.  for the next 90 minutes I was locked in my seat, unable to shut my eyes, or even think about nothing except the movie. This movie turned out to be my favorite of all time. It was so powerful, and the message so clear. Honestly I believe it should be shown in every classroom, as it will scare anyone out of the drug culture. It personally frightened me out of any hard drugs. The characters are so loveable and believable that whenever something happens to them you get more and more depressed. The movie ended on such a powerful note. The artistic integrity of the movie was astounding. Filmatography was excellent, and the director couldn't have done a better job. I was physically unable to move from my seat for 10 minutes after watching it in the theatre, and then again at home... Everyone... EVERYONE should watch this. There has never before been such a real movie in my eyes. It doesn't just entertain",Null,1,1,23 June 2001
The Thin Red Line," film with potential, ruined by sloppiness
","At first glance, I thought this movie was going to be good. Then as I watched for awhile, my brain was twisted into a mush by the nonsensical rantings of the narrators. Sometimes it was deep in thought and helped along the mood, but other times it was completely uneccesary, and didn't make sense. I consider myself as a pretty good movie analyzer, and I couldn't make sense of a lot of things. Sometimes the movie just became slow and dull and didn't keep me captivated. All you beatniks out there can say what you will about it being deep and portraying the human emotions, and how man copes with is environment, but you don't have me suckered. I like a deep movie that takes a lot of thought, but no matter how much you think, insanity does not make sense. I give this 6/10 for effort and because I like war movies. P.S. George Clooney was in the movie for not even 5 minutes. I was pleased",Null,0,0,8 July 2000
