The Blair Witch Project," A clever con job.
","There's hardly a scary moment in the film, or one that's tolerably coherent or insightful.  The actors are making it up as they go, and it shows.  I feel like a sucker for buying into the mania, and my wife feels even worse--the hand-held camcorder scenes gave her motion sickness.  Save your money.  You can see better movies made with your own camcorder.",2,1,3,4 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kidman's superb acting combines with Kubrick's verbally complex screenplay to offer a many-layered analysis of contemporary gender roles.
","Kubrick dares to use long takes, complex dialogue, and subtle motifs to give us a noir 'Scenes from a Marriage' that comments not only on marital role-playing, but our culture's larger obsession with gender roles, sex, and heroism.  Cruise is impotent through most if not all of the movie, and engages the audience in the titillation of seeing but not touching that characterizes American attitudes toward sex.  He tries to play the hero but cannot, and only Kidman's character (and Pollack's, if we trust him) recognizes the warts on the face of the all-American boy.  Risky business, indeed!  Characters develop and grow deeper and more human before our eyes, amply justifying the danse macabre pace.  And the film's self-referentiality to movie  audience's fascination with nudity, orgiastic sex, and the star power of Kidman and Cruise adds an even richer layer to Kubrick's concoction.  Not his best, but worthy of them.",10,0,0,27 July 1999
