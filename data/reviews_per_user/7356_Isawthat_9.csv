Skyfall," A new and better Bond
","James Bond is now Human, His Seemingly Superhuman ways, aided by freeky technology have diminished, he is now shown to be a man that can be broken, and hasn't this brought light to a franchise that could have faded.The rugged and believable Daniel Craig plays this well, though there was the odd moment I felt the scene was a tad cheesy, Judi Dench is the best 'M' ever, showing a chequered past and a need 'In the end' to redeem herself, and what a great choice Javier Bardem was, well played as the head villain, could see more of that level of casting, directing and scripting.Bring on more of this 'Bond'",9,1,4,29 March 2013
Star Trek," As my customary farewell would seem oddly self serving, I will simply say... good luck
","From the opening scene through to the credits, this entry in the 'Star Trek' franchise was worthy and well worth the wait. Rumours abounded and fan sites were a buzz with word that a new movie was on the making, the word was the movie was 'B' grade and may not be worthy. How crazy joyous were we when we sat and watched as young versions of the original crew appeared and we were drawn into the plot.Crazy Australian (Erik Bana) plays Crazed Romulan bent on revenge. (I'm Aussie, .. yes he is crazy .. if only people from around the world could have seen him in such shows as 'Fast Forward or 'Eric'Young Kirk (Chris Pine) is as always unable to accept defeat.Spoke (Zachary Quinto) once again struggles with his human and Logical self.Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is sexier than ever! (Back in the 60's our jaws dropped at those short skirts)And Scotty (Simon Pegg) is busy giving her all she's got.And the rest of the regular bridge crew is there, Bones, Sulu and Chekov amuses once again with his accent.The movie draws from previous movies and the series to produce scenes and quotes to keep any trekkie delirious with delights.If your a trekkie, this entry will not fail you!Bring on the sequels!",10,5,8,22 November 2010
Passengers," A truly satisfying Sci Fi Romance
","Lucky me was able to purchase cheap tickets to see 'Passengers' at an Advanced Screening in Centennial Park's out doors cinema in Sydney Australia on the 30th of Dec 2016, a few days before the official release, had read the critics reviews, was expecting a lackluster movie ... being a Sci Fi nerd I wanted to see the movie regardless, plus I enjoy Fruit Bats making noise, flying over head and pooping on me while watching movies :) Enjoyed this movie so very much, and so did the crowd, a hearty cheer and clapping was heard at the end ... Passengers is a good movie, do yourself a favor and see it while it's still on the big screen.",Null,0,2,4 January 2017
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Another triumph for children's literature
","Once again in life I have been enthralled with what was a brilliant children's book which was so wonderfully brought to life on the big screen, this motion picture sits in my psyche with Danny the champion of the world and The railway children,(both of which are British also) both of those movies I long to see again, so the fact that The lion the witch and the wardrobe has been produced in recent times and will be available on DVD soon is a bonus I am glad of, this movie including the cast is closely created to the series which as far as cinema graphic values go was a long way from this masterpiece, yet still enjoyable and something I would gladly watch again and my children who are now adults have expressed their desire also to view the series again, I so hope the rest of the books in the series are made into films and made with the same skill and production values as this wonderful movie.",10,3,3,17 July 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Closer to the book but not as sweet as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.
","So much to live up to, Johnny normally shines in off beat rolls, but whether direction or personal choices let the Willy W character be far less sweet in this attempt.The use of CGI must have saved quite a lot of time and effort as well as $, and in my opinion brought something to it that the original had no access to, though the original used what was available to a far greater extent and wins hands down regardless.The actors were either better actors or better directed in the original.Found it far easier to get lost in the original.Certain scenes lacked the the brilliance brought to the original by Gene Wilder, especially when gene got spooky and intense.Watch them both, they are both enjoyable, but the 1971 offering still wins easily.",6,1,2,9 July 2016
Avatar," Cowboys and Indians in Space
","Or perhaps Cowboys and Indians on the Moon (Amazon Women on the Moon (1987)though the later was a comedy.Breathtaking visuals, amazing concept and more than enough to cover the age old smaltz of good guys versus greedy bad guys (with one of the bad guys being a cyber double agent) This is truly Cowboys and Indians in Space.Perhaps a Muppet version to come.Seriously ... if you like entertainment ... this movie has liberal doses ..... it's eye candy with latherings of sweets to make Willy Wonka lament the sugar trade .... and a chocaholic die of choco poisoning ...If you are looking for entertainment .. can cope with Sci Fi meets a western ... this is the one movie not to miss!",9,0,3,9 January 2010
Hancock," Finally, a superhero movie that breaks the mold.
","Hancock is the first super hero movie I can think of that breaks the mold of the classic 'Good V Evil' Sadly the user comments of 'this movie lacks a villain' are not only short sighted but incorrect. Villain :- Self loathing, self doubt, self abuse, lack of respect and understanding of what his heavy handedness was causing etc. and the victory over these villains is that someone believes in the super guy. To all those who made negative comments such as 'Lacks a villain', you are stuck in a rut, and thinking like yours hobbles Hollywood from being brave to think outside the tiny plastic mold you create. Well done. Can we seemore of this please!!",8,3,5,28 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force had a big nap
","In 1977 I was 17, I attended a Cinema in Sydney Australia and watched the new release of 'Star Wars (1977)' now with the added words 'A new Hope' ... Already a fan of Sci Fi I found the movie to be excellent fun.On the 17th Of December 2015 I went to the Cinema here in Sydney and watched what I consider to be a revamp of that 1977 movie.This new offering was fun and visually exciting.The thing I found myself thinking during the movie were, couldn't we have a new plot with our new actors?Yes, as I said, good fun, and I did enjoy it a lot, though the fact that I had thoughts that I'm sure many others had and will express here means that for all the $ spent of the movie a completely original plot was not worthy of such spending, and this meant I was noticing those things instead of being absorbed in the movie, so my hope to find 2hrs 15min of total escape from my mundane life did not happen.So, we have a promise of more movies, this plot line can no longer be used again ... I hope, surely the next movie will not be based on 'The Empire Strikes Back'!",8,0,11,17 December 2015
The Pursuit of Happyness," Rages to riches story a winner
","Honestly, I only saw this movie due to being out on a date, really wanted to go see 'Night at the Museum', however, am now glad that I saw this excellent movie, upon investigation I have found why it so clearly states that the movie is 'Based' on a true story, reading up on Chris Gardner I find much of the movie has been designed to make the character much more appealing than possibly Mr Gardner may have been in real life, and thats not a spoiler, the movie has been made well and I would encourage anyone to see it, very glad I did, it was inspiring and I found my eyes moistening up on more than one occasion. Go see this movie if your going on a date. 9 out of 10",9,1,2,31 January 2007
