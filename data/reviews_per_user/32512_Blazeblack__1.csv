Blade Runner 2049," Slow, bland and boring
","Little to no character development, the visuals are okay at best, the fighting scenes that are few and far in between are generic to the point of being borderline cringe. Not sure if the movie has huge plot holes or If I slept through some scenes because of how boring it was as half of the time I had no idea what was going on, how did he know where to go etc... How in the world does this movie have an 8/10 rating?",4,6,11,21 June 2019
