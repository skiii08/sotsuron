Despicable Me 2," Mediocre in every sense
","There is nothing much to say except that this movie which is now the 2nd biggest blockbuster of the year is plain. I guess we are in the Twilight age when mindless, depth lacking films are blockbusters and beloved by the drone masses while great films are never given their just dues and forgotten. As the Twilight saga proved, intelligence and substance is dead.Now for this movie. Animation sucks, poorly done CG and very off looking. It is so obviously poor quality but since that is what the public is used to, of course it is beloved.Story is childish. This film is JUST for kids and a few really really kiddish adults. Heck i watch loads of animated films and consider myself a kid at heart but then again the animations i like actually have depth and emotion and story and most of all SUBSTANCE! This film lacks it all. No story (fit for small kids), no substance which actually was there in the first one, no emotions and no depth. In fact it is so bland, i am in shock at how far public tastes have fallen to make this a hit. Some dumb-ass i saw wrote how very Pixar and adult this film is. Intelligence and substance is falling way too quickly in our society as proved by this person. Apparently substance-less, beyond childish drivel with a few minor references to movies is considered a coup in film making. Wit, intelligence, emotionally driven stories that actually have a message and soul are a taboo in society these days. Character development is near 0. And the minions silliness drives this film. Perfect for people who hate thinking or who are shallow and these people number in the millions as the twilight saga has just proved.",3,18,31,28 July 2013
Brave," Beautiful movie
","What a fantastic film that has gotten such a terrible backlash.Reasons for backlash:1)People hate princess films and according to them it is the same as the others. Well anyone with an iota of intelligence will tell you that each princess film has a different story, a different message and a different but ever so present soul. We live in a society where two characters who have the same hair color and different faces and different personalities are viewed by the masses of people to be identical and the same person because people are superficial and so this film has a princess and that one SINGLE fact makes the film the SAME as all other princess films. Oh how intelligence has plummeted.2) This is story about tradition and myth. That is part of the core of the tale. We live in a society with no tradition or real culture other than pop culture. So obviously the turmoil of the leads will go over the heads of the masses. I have friends who have been in situations where they were forced to marry someone and refusal to do so would have ghastly consequences for their families. It is real and heart breaking. In our society however people sleep with a hundred people before and even after marriage and can marry and divorce as they please without giving a rat's ass for their families who could suffer the brunt of their decisions. We live in a selfish society so obviously putting ourselves in the shoes of or even imagining what Merida and her mother go through and their reasons will not register with millions. No one will understand how breaking tradition could have disastrous consequences. They have no idea how in other countries how tradition and culture is a backbone of societies other than ours. people cannot in our society put themselves into the shoes of others as we are too selfish. And that is the truth.3) This story has legends and stories, myths, tales that guide our heroines. In a society without stories that date thousands of years, cautionary tales and tales of truths to guide us, i doubt the impact of that will reach the minds of the public. Though abroad many and i mean many nations have tales, legends that date back thousands of years before our country received its name. These tales would guide people and be sources of moral and brainy wisdom for the children and adults. So obviously that went over everyone's heads. People in other countries hundreds upon hundreds of years ago used these legends and myths, these tales, to grow as a people.And to this day people in such countries still tell these tales to their kids as a moral message, teaching and preventing history from occurring.4) Apparently it has no humor and people want humor over substance. I mean anyone seen The Hangover trilogy. Well people loved it as it shows what society is all about and that is public mindset.5) It is about a mother-daughter story, it has moral messages and a lot of deep meaning. Apparently that means it is 'cliché'. What an overused word by the pseudo intellectual pretentious idiots who lack profound sense and think substance and sweetness is cliché just because they are sick douches. Half the time they don't even know what it means. I mean these days the word cheesy is used to describe anything with substance, sweetness, kindness, soul and love. And so something with profound wisdom and sheer lovely heart is considered cheesy while on the other hand depraved psycho disgusting buffoonery is considered amazing. Oh how far moral and substance has fallen in this society and how pretentious pseudo-intellect has taken over. Wisdom and profound thought and substance is dead or according to the depraved superficial and supposedly know it all generation 'cheesy'. Our society is so egoistic and full of itself that it cannot be educated or told great messages since according to them, they know everything and no one should dare question that by putting a real message in a movie. Even if these people know nothing they still must be considered to be the greatest and smartest. People hate their families or have been so poorly raised and some in favor of pets or vice versa where pets are considered better family than people so obviously their hate for the real meaning of life and family and love which they look down upon is 'cheesy' and 'cliche'. Well that is society for you and i hope that great movies with substance don't get the boot in favor of what such people want.",10,59,99,28 July 2013
