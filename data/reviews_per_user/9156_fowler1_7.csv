The Blair Witch Project," Stay Out Da Bushes!
","Sorry to quote Jesse, but I couldn't resist. This movie has garnered much divided opinion; both camps are right. It sucks AND it's great. First of all, immediately dismiss every opinion that whines 'where's the blood?'. Simpletons who need monsters and gore to officially enjoy a horror movie should park their cars on road shoulders and read back issues of FANGORIA while waiting for the next highway fatality to rubberneck. This is essentially a ghost story, and ghost stories frighten with mood and suggestion, not with slashed carotid arteries. But most of the naysayers have a point: after the overkill of the media hype, you DO walk away deeply disappointed after the first viewing. The narrative structure, such as it is, is clumsy and tedious. But part of that disappointment is due to the fact that horror movies are marketed to yahoos, and otherwise-rational viewers have become all too willing to think and act like yahoos when watching a horror movie in a theater. And who can blame 'em? This is what you get after 20 years of horror 'comedies' that substitute CGI, 'dream' sequences, brand-name psychos, and idiot movie critics who analogize the horror genre down to the level of a 'rollercoaster ride'. To release a serious, straightfaced, artistic horror movie nowadays is to ask audiences to think unsettling thoughts and FEEL something genuine: far easier to let the latex do the talking over a heavy-metal soundtrack and hope you can con enough kids into believing a 'director's cut' DVD of ELM STREET 12 is a statement for the ages worth owning. Now, while BLAIR WITCH is far from perfect, it does have one 'monster' that no fx wizard could ever approach...those damned woods. Anyone who's ever gotten lost on a camping trip, or even driven through the woods at night, knows exactly what I'm saying here. There's something deeply, frighteningly eldritch and pre-human about wooded areas. Early in the movie, the three students drive past a rotted, primitive shack nestled in the woods. The shack plays no part whatsoever in the later scenes, it's just a two-second visual throwaway, but it called up disturbing memories. I've driven past a dozen shacks like that, and I always wonder: who lives there, COULD live there? I never think 'those people must be desperately poor'; instead, I think 'this is what communing with nature really means'. Nature isn't Bambi and Grizzly Adams, it's harsh, unforgiving, cruel, remorseless; the territory of elder Gods who predate our warm and fuzzy civilized notions of deities and divinities. To live out in those woods and survive, you must bring tribute and make offerings to elemental forces so terrible that our ancestors finally fled, formed socities, created cities....ain't NOTHING scarier than the wild. As the three kids in this movie venture deeper into the woods, I felt a deep intuitive foreboding forming in the most primitive jelly of my brain. They're doomed because they've learned to be afraid of people but they've forgotten to be afraid of Nature, and deeper they go into a place where the very terrain- the rocks, the trees, the dirt beneath their feet - is the predator stalking them. All the faux-hostility they've learned from rap music and schoolyard brawls can't help them now. If you saw this flick and left the theater underwhelmed, see it again, alone, late at night. You might think twice about preserving any rainforest anywhere. The 'movie' part of BLAIR WITCH may be weak tea, but those haunted woods are scarier than any weightlifter in a hockey mask.",Null,0,1,4 October 2000
Inglourious Basterds," A Tainted Triumph
","Look, by now nobody needs one more plot synopsis of INGLOURIOUS - you all know the drill. Ditto on Christoph Waltz, who's very good (though I have a sneaking suspicion the level of hosannas he's receiving from critics are due to their never having heard of the guy before). For Tarantino and the Weinsteins, this represents a desperately-needed critical/b.o. rebound from the debacle that was DEATH PROOF, which is why it got a late-August release after all the other big summer movies have already come & gone. Add in the now-obligatory Tarantino-fanboy choir drowning out the relatively few naysayers and the result is QT's biggest-ever hit. But will you respect INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS in the morning? Pros? Well, let's start with 'hurray for Steadicam!' Finally, a movie that doesn't require taking two Dramamine in the lobby beforehand - hallelujah. Next, I'm happy to report that Waltz isn't the only heretofore-unknown (to Yanks, at least) European find the movie offers: Daniel Bruhl, Melanie Laurent, Michael Fassbender and Denis Menochet all turn in first-rate work. Fassbender's entire performance is a film-geek inside joke (he's Trevor Howard in THE THIRD MAN brought out of retirement, kinda), but it's a satisfying inside joke; Laurent and Bruhl provide the film with both heart and moral complexity; and Menochet - who resembles a younger, handsomer Jean Reno - is the unheralded component in that celebrated first scene, whose superb straight-man work sets up/off Waltz beautifully. The Bowie song works exactly as Tarantino intended it to (though he needs to lay off the Morricone swipes for a while - once is an homage; twice, a ripoff). The pacing, which has drawn criticism, is leisurely throughout, but that's okay: Tarantino is a storyteller who's as much about the asides as the plot - probably more so. He takes his time, sure, but we want him to linger in this world. (If your beef with IB is the glacial rhythm of the setpieces, wait a few weeks/months and watch it again - you'll probably discover you've changed your mind about the 'pacing' issue.) As for his long suit - the dialogue - he's mostly on form. And at least for once we get to listen to 40s hipsters, instead of the more tiresome contemporary kind (and I do mean tiresome: David Carradine's KILL BILL 2 monologue pretty much took the air out of that movie's tires, while DEATH PROOF clattered along, riding on its rims, interminably.) Now for the cons. The marketing campaign for the film is just that, a con, and a huge one, right down to the 'kosher porn' and 'as a Jew, I thank you' quotes attached to the production; primarily designed to separate suckers from their scratch. (Somehow, I doubt Lawrence Bender and Harvey Weinstein would be very enthusiastic at the number of likable and even heroic Nazis in the movie had IB tanked that all-important First Weekend of Release.) This might be the first commando picture with hardly any commandoes in it! Secondly, there are so many logical and historical gaffes in the film they turn, inevitably, into potholes - you're willing to endure the first few w/o complaint, growing more and more ticked off as they just keep coming. (And please, no cries of 'duh! - it's a MOVIE, Einstein!' We're not talking about a few holes here, but a block of Swiss cheese.) Third, the casting of Hitler and Goebbels is disastrous - a little levity is one thing, but this is CARRY ON FUEHRER! And last (though hardly least) is the most troubling of all: at some deeper level, Tarantino movies are always about the cruelly kinetic joy of sadism and murder....and IB proudly continues this odious 'tradition'. The 'feminist' - and now, 'anti-fascist' - subtext of his films are just cynical window dressing, there to provide convenient but utterly bogus moral cover for the atrocities that make QT's wee-wee twitch to attention. Which isn't to say they're not effective: the image of Laurent's face superimposed on smoke in the film's gotterdammerung finale is real nightmare material, with a phantasmagoric eerieness that's hard to shake. But the crux of this sequence is watching screaming people trapped by design in a fiery inferno, and it's presented as popcorn-munching entertainment for the masses (we're meant to applaud in delight); given the hideous parallels to everything from the Triangle Factory to the Station nightclub (and to the poor souls who tossed themselves from the top of the WTC on 9/11 rather than burn to cinders), it's an evil scene. Depicting such a horror is one thing - CELEBRATING it as catharsis is something else entirely...... entirely too much, in my view. (The legion of Tarantino fanboys will no doubt insist that it's meant not to feed an audience's bloodlust, but instead to provoke thought and discussion. Well in that case, I'll be waiting for the Museum of Modern Art to book a HOSTEL II/MAN BEHIND THE SUN double-feature any day now.)So there you have it. A well-made, fairly riveting Tootsie Pop, with a cancerous center lying in wait under the candy coating. I liked it for what it did well, though obviously with some deep misgivings; your own mileage may vary.",Null,0,4,6 September 2009
L.A. Confidential," A Great Novel Becomes A Good Movie
","That's not a knock. Well, not much of one, anyway. Curtis Hanson was handed a near-impossible task: translate the best crime novel in a generation - one that requires a six or seven-hour running time to render faithfully - into a two-hour film. Give him credit for doing a good job of it, but let's not get so dewy-eyed that we ignore what was lost here: not just vital subplots but depth, layering, richness of detail. Gone are not only the Inez Soto/Dieterling-cum-Disney angle (and the piercing social commentary threaded into this sub-narrative) but the entire background/motivating force to the Ed Exley character, now reduced to a by-the-book, son-of-a-dead-patrolman tightass. Further, the concluding half-hour piles the climaxes together, one after another, straining and finally shredding credulity. The decision-making involved (likely forced down Hansen, Ellroy and screenwriter Helgeland's throats by the moneymen holding the pursestrings to the entire project) has also robbed us of any chance of seeing the entire LA Quartet brought to the screen, at least in any recognizable form, now that the Dudley Smith cat's out of the bag & dispensed with.So, then...what's on the PLUS side of the ledger here? Pacing and performances. While the characters of Bud White, Ed Exley & Jack Vincennes have been pre-softened for your viewing convenience, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce & Kevin Spacey pour everything they have into their roles, and...for the duration of the film...you believe in these characters. Crowe may be the current flavor-of-the-month, but DAMN he's good, smoldering like the burning tip of a Chesterfield. Spacey works vocal inflections and raised eyebrows like a virtuoso musician (he patterned his interpretation after Hanson's suggestion of Dean Martin as the ideal Vincennes, were this film actually made in '53) and Pearce, in the most thankless of the three roles, overcomes both the scenario's short-shrifting of the character's motivations and his own too-youthful appearance, managing to turn both to his advantage. The female lead, Ms Basinger, while overpraised, does fine, heartfelt work; and Danny DeVito is dependably Danny DeVito. All the secondary roles are both beautifully-cast and expertly-played as well, which helps the production immeasurably. James Cromwell is physically wrong for Dudley Smith, yet makes the role his own, emanating a bottomless pool of menace; Tomas Arana makes a wonderfully slimy Bruening, and David Straithairn and John Mahan both seem plucked from the 40s - they are uncanny physical matches to both their characters and the era being evoked. And Curtis Hansen keeps the action hurtling forward, a series of snowballs rolling downhill, picking up speed & force as they coalesce into one single storyline. Anyone not familiar with the novel is going to have damned little to complain about, and even Ellroy fans will grudgingly admit that the film being as good as it is constitutes a minor miracle. Still, those viewers who know only the film should make tracks to Ellroy's novel. Their pleasure will only be intensified by that small sting of regret at What Might Have Been.",Null,0,1,19 March 2002
Mulholland Drive," Hilarious
","No, not the movie...the comments! My favorite was the guy who chided naysayers by pointing out that MULHOLLAND requires a modicum of intelligence to figure out - then added it took him 12 viewings to make sense of this! (ONLY twelve?)Lynch made THE ELEPHANT MAN & the spare, lovely STRAIGHT STORY, so it's not as if he's a fraud, without any talent. But these Rorschach puzzle nonsense-films he's known for are the equivalent of monkeys throwing fruit at a canvas, complete with the subsequent onrush of posturing phonies who ooh and ahh over the results. 'Exegesis' my ass. If not for a memorable performance clip of 'Llorando', this mess would be every bit as snoozeworthy as - as - as practically every other Lynch movie!LOST HIGHWAY fans (yes, both of you) will be pleased to note that Lynch continues his questionable tradition of bamboozling an out-of-circulation ex-star into embarrassing themselves with a supporting role (here, it's Ann Miller). Otherwise, the 'mystery' here is the eternal David Lynch mystery: how does he talk people into financing these things?",Null,0,1,28 September 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," A Sidebar Point Or Two
","There's no need to echo the praise this film receives from seemingly everyone, but I've always been fascinated by its continuing, if not growing, appeal to modern audiences. The Bedford Falls of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has never existed and I think we all know that: it's sheer fantasy composed of equal portions of wish-fulfillment and nostalgia, but the type of fantasy that summons the better angels within us and ennobles us by lifting us out of the mundane and towards the ideal. Bedford Falls is childhood and innocence tucked away in the safe harbor of the past. Where this movie's immense power lies is in the Pottersville scenes...let's face it, Pottersville is what contemporary America IS. (Has anyone ever noted that while Bedford Falls is obviously a studio set, the camera pans through nightmarish Pottersville look like stock footage of any postwar American city?) That contrast, that emotional dichotomy, is what strikes such a chord within us: the idealized never-was vs the harsh, unforgiving can't-wish-it-away of grim reality. By the same token, the movie's true message - Bedford Falls is within reach of us all if we love our friends and family, stay the course despite setbacks, and treat others with kindness and respect - is even more seductive and affecting now than in 1946. It's little wonder this movie tanked on first release, as its peculiar magic needs to acquire antique status to reach its full power. I'm sure the first half of the film seemed as unbearably corny to postwar audiences as it now seems impossible to resist to audiences who are unceasingly bludgeoned with entertainment built upon callousness, carnality and levels of brutality once unthinkable. (Which is why the notion of a remake is utterly laughable: even younger audiences who don't 'get' old black & white movies are intuitive enough to grasp that this kind of heartfelt sentiment properly belongs to a different America - the America contemporary Hollywood has taught them to despise.) Though everyone focuses on the well-known plot and a truly stunning performance by Jimmy Stewart, it's worth noting that this might be Capra's most superbly directed project. There's no exotica a la LOST HORIZON or showy MR SMITH filibusters on view; WONDERFUL LIFE is more introspective and mellow a film, Capra in a minor key. But every setpiece is staged and photographed expertly, and all the big payoffs resonate with honest and powerful emotion. The scene with young George Bailey and the drunken, grief-crazed druggist is as beautifully done as any in Capra's long career, and that's just the first of many high points here. Maybe the most satisfying aspect of the film is the inability of film critics to resist taking a shot at it: you keep reading over and over how IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a 'dark' film with a pessimistic view of middle-class aspirations, despite the fact that millions of viewers, year after year, watch it as a reaffirmation of those same values. And Frank Capra made movies for ordinary people, whom he loved, and not critics, whom he tolerated.",Null,1,4,16 December 2000
The Sixth Sense," Transcendent Horror
","No teenagers. No 'dream sequences'. No slashers. No sophomoric comedy relief. No CGI overkill. No NOTHIN' to insult the viewer's intelligence or embarrass the cast and crew. Pure and simple: the best horror film of the 90s, and the most moving and transcendent horror film in many, many years. Hell, maybe ever. Somewhere, Val Lewton, Montague James and Ambrose Bierce are looking down, beaming with pride. If you're not choking back an honestly-earned sob by the film's end, please resign from the human race. And this from someone who, having read 'An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge' as a child, saw the snap ending coming very early on. Doesn't matter: masterpiece.",Null,0,0,7 August 2000
Casino," Scorsese At His Best - And Worst
","Since GOODFELLAS, Scorsese's gone beyond Great Director status; his talent, vision and confidence, combined with his unofficial coronation among serious moviehounds as King of the Medium, have elevated him to Virtuoso. Every one of his 90s projects feature staggering camera movement, audacious violence, tour-de-force visual setpieces. The opening of this film - DeNiro spinning up and out of an exploding Caddy in glittering slo-mo, segueing into credits superimposed over state-of-the-art montage work...your opinion of the film's morality aside, it's the kind of jaw-dropping stunner that has become a Scorsese trademark. Like the Copa sequence in GOODFELLAS, it's the unbridled brio of a director who has not just Arrived, but occupies a plateau where his only remaining competition is with himself. If only he had the ability to pull back now and then and maintain some perspective...but his style of complete immersion into the story he is telling, more and more often these days, leaves him adrift without a moral compass here. And, Lord, could CASINO use one. It's not simply the violence on display, but the soul-dead callousness of every last living, creeping or crawling thing in the film that numbs me even as I'm awed by the compositional fireworks of the filmmaking. Everyone in this film is either vicious and corrupt, or weak and corrupt, and several characters are both at once. The 'love' story between DeNiro and a shrill, hollow Sharon Stone is like a sick parody of romantic love. The gangster/buddy angle is nil, as we see from frame one that De Niro and Pesci's 'friendship' is mutually suspicious and parasitic. The Vegas 'backstory' angle, which dominates the first hour, is visually riveting as you'd expect - Scorsese employs every type of shot in the lexicon of moviemaking here, taking the viewer on the ultimate insider's tour of how a casino operates - all in the service of the most cynical of themes: the fix is in, there are only predators and prey, and the prey deserve their agony - otherwise they'd be in on the feeding frenzy. This is part of the increasingly ugly side of Scorsese: his conscious sacrifice of any moral center, the better to solidify his appeal to the sociopath audience, probably embodied in the gangster types he grew up with in Little Italy. Or am I alone in noticing that the amoral-adolescent audience (of ALL ages) who fetishize unfeeling 'hardness' respond and identify so strongly with his latter-day work, almost as visual aids to help achieve a zen-like serenity in ruthlessness? I've heard audiences laugh in approving hilarity at some of the most appalling brutality in his films, dating back to RAGING BULL but really emerging with GOODFELLAS, which parallels his increasing disregard for protagonists who represent any kind of moral conflict. The Joe Pesci of RAGING BULL was a torn and vulnerable individual; the Pesci of CASINO is a conscienceless thug, period. You feel nothing when he dies, not even revulsion at the blood and viscera of the scene. He's one more fly whose time has come to have his wings pulled off. There are no more Charlies (of MEAN STREETS) in Scorsese's urban films, or even Travis Bickles, to truly disturb an audience by awakening their own dormant conflicting emotions. There are only Max Cadys, Nicky Santoros, Jimmy Conways. Heroes, even nominal ones, are quickly trivialized into hypocrites, cowards, rats and larval psychopaths. One wonders if Scorsese, for all his brilliance, could have ascended so high in the current pop-culture firmament without throwing out any belief in something better than remorseless efficiency and murder-as-commerce like so much sentimental ballast. He could have been, still can be, the Michaelangelo of cinema. Of course, Goya was a great artist too, but how long before he abandons being Goya for Joe Coleman?",Null,0,1,17 February 2000
