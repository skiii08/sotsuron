The Avengers," All in all, one of the best films I've seen in a while.
","Cannot find too much fault in this film, apart from maybe the fact you will need to have seen all previously related films, luckily I had seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor, so I knew the back story from the get-go.I feel all of the characters were given enough screen time, I would have maybe liked to see Thor a bit more, I think he was underused, he could have done a lot more with his massive power, like killing one of those massive lizard things on his own, the character of the Hulk was brilliantly well played by Mark Ruffalo, he portrayed Banner as a very calm and collected man and very laid back which is needed for him, it created a newfound interest in the character for me, as I was never a great fan of the Hulk. As always Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job of Iron Man, with the majority of the film's funny lines coming from him.Chris Hemsworth borough back the mighty Thor and did so tremendously, like I said I think he could have been used a lot more, the Black Widow was also a nice addition, even though she had appeared previously in Iron Man 2, (although the tight leather outfit was a bit distracting lol.) I found it incredibly hard to stop looking at her behind, but luckily I was wearing 3D glasses in the dark so nobody could tell.Hawkeye was really well played, for some reason the actor looks a LOT like Gerard Butler to me, I don't know why. But regardless he is a great character and I found it very funny when he asked Iron Man for a lift up to a roof of a building, and Tony Stark replied 'Ok hang on then Legolas'. Little funny lines like that made the entire cinema laugh a lot.The humour of the film mainly came from Iron Man/Tony Stark, also quite a lot of funny moments came from Bruce Banner/The Hulk. I was a bit confused as to why he can suddenly control the Hulk, when he completely lost control on the ship earlier on. There were deep and meaningful thoughts about Bruce's alter ego, but there was a lot of humour to be had from the Hulk as well, (particularly when he smashes Loki on the ground again and again).One small annoyance I had was the continuity on the level of strength and toughness each character had. In the film Thor, he was made to look like the most powerful being ever, with one whack sending big ice men flying 50 feet in the air, but in this film he only whacks them back about ten feet, which is exactly the same distance Captain America and Iron Man can hit (which it shows in the fight scene involving the three of them). It's just an annoyance of mine but I found it hard to figure out which one of them had the most strength, fair enough Steve Rogers is a super soldier but Thor is a demigod, you would think he would have a lot more more strength in comparison, one second a whack from Thor's Hammer can knock the Hulk ten feet away, but it doesn't even leave a scratch on Captain America's shield? And yes I know the shield is made with some indestructible material mentioned in the Cap film, but the Hulk is quite tough too and he got knocked away completely.I also kinda wished they fought directly next to each other more, you never see all of them at the exact same place, they're always scattered about and you never get the feeling they are a full team, throughout the film I was waiting for some epic bit where all 5 of them pulled off some unique combo that involved all of them, but the most I got was two or three of them in the same place in the final battle.But all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely frightful, you get some empathy for Bruce Banner, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it, I was worrying it might be too many characters for one film but they nailed it.",10,27,51,28 April 2012
Man of Steel," Not as great as I hoped it would be.
","Don't get me wrong, I LONG for a Justice League movie, and lots of other DC movies, but this one took me a long time to get into.The pacing was very bad at the start. One minute we were enjoying a fantastic look at Krypton, he is then sent to Earth where my wife and I were hoping we would see the Kents discover him. Nope, it jumps to him at the age of 33, with a couple of flashback scenes which were done well. First he was on a fishing boat, next a waiter, then he ended up in the Arctic or wherever it was, then BAM, met his father, got his costume which was conveniently left on a random ship, met Lois and saved her life. Then she fell in love with him instantly and became his stalker. Happened too fast, like they were rushing all of that to get to the BIG battles at the end.The character of Lois Lane in this movie did not hold my interest at ALL. In the comics she is supposed to be very pretty but in my opinion Amy Adams was such a bad move, not to mention she is almost 40 years old, while Henry Cavill is only 30, too much of an age gap when they could have had someone better play Lois. Amy just looked like she had the flu for the entirety of filming, pale and wrinkles with a pained expression like she had just broken her hip. Which is weird considering she is only 38. Not old at all. I genuinely didn't care if Lois died or not, she didn't manage to convey she actually loved Clark, she only seemed to get obsessed with him by stalking him down.Henry Cavill did very well in my opinion. One thing that kinda freaked me out is how he was so pale in a lot of shots. Same with Lois, not sure if it was a director's decision to make everybody pale or if it was just the lighting while filming, but oh well. He did do very well but I did miss the natural charisma of Superman. The Golden Boy in Blue attitude that makes him appear like he can do no wrong in the eyes of the public, yes this is only the origin story, but he didn't seem to have the charisma he does in other media variations of him. That is what sets him apart from other Justice League members like Batman, he is naturally charismatic and is seen as the typical idea of what a superhero should be. An all around good person who doesn't have a bad bone in his body. It is hinted at the end with his discussions with the military though so it's not gone entirely. I don't think it would have been a good idea to have a Superman that doesn't talk or smile.Quite a lot of the actors had such a wooden performance. Russell Crowe seemed like he just did it for the cheque, his face moved once during the whole movie and that was when he died.Also, the fight scenes, SO GODDAMN LOUD! Not sure if it was just our movie theatre but my god it was loud, I had to cover my ears for a lot of it and started to get a headache. I did enjoy them and they were done brilliantly, but turn down the damn volume. I'm only 20 but I felt like shouting to the projectionist to quieten it down.Overall, the movie could have been better, you don't see Clark Kent news reporter, you don't see a Fortress of Solitude (a ship isn't the damn Fortress I don't care what you say), you see barely any connection with him and Lois Lane, you really don't care about any of the characters. The good parts? Visually it is absolutely flawless. Up there with the Avengers and Thor.Oh by the way, Jonathan Kent died standing still in a tornado after saving a dog, because Supes wasn't allowed to save him? Yet he doesn't mind saving a bus of kids and letting his dad die. No. Not accepting that. Nonsense.If you are committed to Superman and DC in general, go see it. But don't fully expect to like it. There didn't seem to be real, believable human interaction in this, if at the end, everyone died but Superman, I would just think, 'Ah right OK, oh well.'. I WISH I could have loved this movie, I very rarely dislike a movie, and I absolutely love everything DC, but I have to say, I like the animated DC movies more.",5,0,0,14 June 2013
The Woman in Black," A lot better than I expected.
","This is my first review so be patient with me, I just have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it turned out a lot better than I expected it to. Daniel Radcliffe's acting gets better and better with every film he appears in.The location is absolutely fantastic, how the tide cuts off the house from the rest of the world and all that is left is the house and the surrounding garden. You truly believe it is a real place and the viewer is given a genuine believable excuse for the house being cut off, the tide is out which completely submerges the road away from the house, rather than being a completely unrealistic excuse like there is a massive wall that cuts off everything.Daniel Radcliffe's acting could be better, but it is far from terrible, you really believe he is Arthur Kipps and not Harry Potter anymore. It is a brilliant thing that he is trying new things, I for one did not expect him to feature in a horror film as his first 'post-Potter' film debut.I really like how they never hid the Woman in Black, you see her directly in many occasions, instead of films such as the Blair With Project where you see NOTHING for an hour and a half.The story behind the Woman in Black was a bit confusing for me, so many names were introduced so fast so it was hard to keep up, I got the general gist of the story and was pleased with the film's ending. You sense towards the end that the Woman in Black has not left and you will see her again before those credits roll. It was kind of 50/50 if Arthur's son would actually end up hurt but I don't believe it was done just for the sake of adding shock value.I also liked the way for a small amount of time you believed that Arthur survived, but only a few seconds later it dawns on you that something feels wrong. From the others' reaction you weren't sure if he had survived or not until you saw the ever so slight visual change in the atmosphere, once Arthur was in 'Limbo' it suddenly went darker and that was a nice, gentle realisation of the situation.",8,2,6,17 February 2012
