Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Above & Beyond the First.
","I had really low expectations on this one. Sequels are rarely as good as their predecessor, and I had read a few negative early reviews. Haha. I'm glad I went and saw it for myself. Honestly, I loved this movie.It's a pretty fast-paced film; a nonstop thrill ride filled with mystery and intrigue. Downey and Law are great together, as always. Their 'chemistry' is spot on, and they really feel like friends who have experienced much together. Noomi Rapace is a great addition to the cast as well, and Jared Harris plays an excellent villain in Moriarty.It's a really fun film as well; don't even get me started on the action sequences. They are thrilling and extremely well shot; the cinematography is beautiful. The forest sequence (if you see the film, you'll not what I mean) is one of the most awesome action bits I've seen in a long while. It's crazy.A really good sequel, that really goes above & beyond the first. The ending is killer, too. Perhaps the best bits of the film are the one on one scenes with Holmes and Moriarty. It's poetic.",8,1,2,30 December 2011
Se7en," One of cinema's best crime thrillers, from the great David Fincher.
","David Fincher is a genius. I love this film, and some people might be turned off by its violent nature, but it really is an amazing crime thriller. A murder mystery tale at its finest.The cast is superb. Morgan Freeman portrays Detective William Somerset, an experienced crime-solver who has been on the force for many years. He plans on retiring soon, & grows tired of the city's horrors. Freeman excels as a character burdened by the city's dark and twisted web of crime. He just wants to get out. Brad Pitt is also very good as newly transferred Detective David Mills. He's short-tempered and impatient, almost the complete opposite of the elderly Somerset. People don't give Pitt enough credit, in my opinion. He's a fine actor & often overlooked (though he is getting the attention he deserves nowadays).The supporting cast is also excellent, with Gwyneth Paltrow playing Mill's wife. She is having trouble adjusting to the dark cityscape in which they now inhabit, and fears that something terrible might happen to her in the oppressive place.The plot is fairly simple. A sadistic murderer has been going around killing in a way that relates to the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, & Wrath. It's very nasty business. Together, Somerset and Mills attempt to solve the murders. What follows is a dark & complex tale as the detectives race to find the murderer.The cinematography in this film is excellent, it's dark and mesmerizing. The city is literally crumbling, and the look is achieved perfectly. The directors & writers really did good work on this, and there is some real emotional weight to the film. The villain is excellent as well (& I'm not going to spoil who he is played by, even though most people have seen this movie by now).& then ending! What a shocker. Bottom Line; If you haven't seen this, watch it! I'm surprised I'm so dang late on this.",9,0,2,3 January 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Best film of 2011.
","David Fincher is brilliant. I thought he had maxed his potential at Social Network, but he came & did it again. Having not seen the Swedish film or read the novel, this was a completely new story for me. & I was blown away! Daniel Craig gives a solid performance as Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist tasked with solving a 40 year old murder. The supporting cast is excellent as well, in particular Christopher Plummer & Stellan Skarsgard. But the real star is Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth Salander, an emotionally damaged and unstable woman bordering on insanity. In every scene, she owns the character. She's fierce, wildly sexy, and unbelievably authentic. She better get an Oscar nomination.David Fincher is known for his dark, edgy style & it shows in this film. the cinematography is fine, but its the score that really shines. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross definitely produced a phenomenal score that goes well with the film. Oh, and don't let me forget the opening credits! Amazing, one of the best.This film is R-rated for a reason though. There is quite a bit of nudity and a particularly disturbing rape scene. Just be forewarned. Overall, my favorite film of the year, just beating out Drive.",10,3,8,7 January 2012
Drive," Finest film all year; Gosling gives his all.
","I'll just come out and say it straight up; this is my favorite film of the year (EDIT: After seeing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this is my 2nd favorite). No contest, honestly. I didn't have the highest expectations going into the theater, but I figured it would at least be a decent film. My expectations were exceeded, in the greatest fashion. I absolutely loved the movie, and instead of decent, I got PHENOMENAL.It moves at a slow pace, yes, but it is so damn mesmerizing and alluring, you can't help but continue to watch. As the film goes on though, the pace seems to pick up a bit. The action bits are amazing. They come out of nowhere, with brutal gore. It really enhances the experience, in my opinion.The acting is top-notch. Gosling gives a great performance as the Driver, even though he utters very few lines during this film. The emotion in his face and eyes are what really shows the character. Everyone else is great as well, with some great performances from Albert Brooks and Carey Mulligan.Perhaps my favorite part of the film, is the musical score. It has a retro 80's feel to it, and one particular song I just couldn't get out of my head. It's great stuff. The cinematography is great as well, it is really well shot. Good stuff.You really have to see the film for yourself, honestly. I HIGHLY recommend this movie; it's pure brilliance.",10,2,6,29 December 2011
Prometheus," Visually stunning & well acted, but it fails to answer all of the questions asked.
","Let's all be honest; Ridley Scott has been putting out some disappointing films these last couple of years. I mean, Robin Hood was a waste of everyone involved. The last great film he put out (in my opinion) was American Gangster back in '07. Now, I've been waiting for this film ever since I heard about it. & let me tell you, this is definitely a return to form for Scott. Not that isn't without its flaws, though.First off, the acting is solid. Noomi Rapace is excellent as Elizabeth Shaw, a god-fearing scientist. As the film progresses, Shaw becomes more a warrior & has to go through some intense scenes, which Noomi nails perfectly. Charlize Theron & Idris Elba are solid in their roles as well. The rest of the supporting cast is great as well, I wouldn't say there were any examples of 'bad' acting in this film, though Logan Marshall-Green is definitely the weakest in terms of acting.The strongest actor, though, is definitely Michael Fassbender. As the android David, he owns the entire role. Out of the whole film, he was my favorite character. He's very mysterious as well, you're not really sure what he is going to do next. Excellent.Now, the visuals. This is a beautiful film. From the opening shots to the end, it's a visual feast. The special effects are top-notch, and the art direction is phenomenal. It's on Avatar's level in this regard. Definitely a huge factor of your enjoyment in the film.Now, here is where many critics & moviegoers are divided; the plot. Now, I can't go too much into it without spoiling anything, but let's just say that the movie seems to be heavily edited (in my opinion). There are odd plot gaps that really bother me, and I hope Ridley Scott pushes out a director's cut when it comes to Blu-Ray.The largest problem with the plot is that it bites off a little more than it can chew. It asks tons of questions, and answers many of them, but it does fail to answer some of the larger ones. It also heaps on several new questions as well. At the end of the film, it feels like a prologue to something greater, which is a bit frustrating.Overall, however, I greatly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend seeing it. It's my favorite film of the year, thus far, & yes I HAVE seen Avengers. I'm more of a science fiction guy though.",9,4,10,11 June 2012
