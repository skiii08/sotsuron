Skyfall," Blah Bond, totally overrated.
","Hard to believe it will be eight years since 'Skyfall' was released when the new Bond picture, 'No Time To Die' hits the screen.
I only hope that 'No Time..' will be much better.
No need to deconstruct 'Skyfall' and its many shortcomings since we've all seen it by now.
Suffice it to say that I found it disappointing; I left the theater wanting so much more (surprise cameos by a few of the past Bond actors, for instance). I remember the audience breaking into applause when the Astin Martin appeared (or should I say re-appeared), but even the iconic 'Bondmobile' got short shrift.
I'll compare my 'Skyfall' experience to watching The Academy Awards show in 2012 on the 50th Anniversary of the Bond franchise. We got Shirley Bassey singing 'Goldfinger' (she was astoundingly good), but that was it. Why, after she sang, did the curtain not raise to reveal ALL the past Bond portrayers walking onstage to wild applause? Because the producer of that particular Academy Awards show was still on a high over his production of the musical, 'Chicago', from years past, and it was given star treatment throughout the show instead.
Terrible. Let's pray for a GREAT final Bond picture from Daniel Craig in 'No Time To Die'.",5,4,9,17 December 2019
A Star Is Born," Non-Bradley Cooper fan cheers his performance!
","The girlfriend just 'HAD' to see 'A Star is Born',
so, okay, I bought the tickets thinking, well, I'm not really a Bradley Cooper fan, and Lady Gaga's, well, pretty good, I guess (awesome Super Bowl performance a couple of years ago).
But the movie was excellent. Lots of emotion, great songs, Cooper really looked and sounded like a rocker- his best performance ever. Lady Gaga was Lady Gaga- that is, incredible. Just go see it. Old story told in a brand new way. I'd like to take at least 'one more look' at this wonderful movie.",8,1,4,7 October 2018
The Irishman," More unpleasant trash being labeled a 'masterpiece'.
","If your idea of an engaging night's entertainment is watching a man's hand smashed to a pulp on the sidewalk, then by all means pull up a chair and watch this film.I'm not going to bash your favorite director,
Martin Scorcese; I know he's made some excellent movies. But, damn, is there something wrong with me because I don't enjoy wallowing in stories about sadistic mobsters? I guess so, judging by the amount of positive reviews for movies like 'Goodfellas'
and 'Casino'.I have to be fair and tell you I only made it halfway through this unpleasant movie- but I knew I'd had enough. Thanks for reading.",3,4,9,18 December 2019
The Mummy," After all these years, it still sucks.
","Saw this lame movie with my late wife on the advice of a friend who 'loved' it. I should have known better; his taste in 'good' movies is NOT good. Obvious use of CGI made the mummy look like a cartoon, and how can a cartoon be terrifying? But then I've never been a fan of the whole 'Mummy' genre, Karloff or not (How scary can a monster be if you can just outrun it as it slowly drags its bandaged body behind you?). Brendan Fraser is no Harrison Ford, either. Forget it.",1,0,3,22 April 2020
Face_Off," Yawnfest with bullets.
","Filmed in the heyday of the Nicholas Cage era,
this trite film attempts to compensate for its ridiculous plot with WAY WAY over-the-top gun battles. I just sat in the theater and yawned during the action sequences. Skip it.",1,1,4,23 January 2019
Die Hard 2," Yippee- ki - NO.
","I missed the first 'Die Hard' when it was released to theaters, (watched it later on VHS, and loved it) so I made sure to see part 2 on the big screen. I haven't felt such disappointment since 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes'. What a letdown!
One of the film's early action scenes has our hero trying to save an airliner full of passengers( he doesn't). O---KAY, so the bad guys have already wiped out 200 plus lives
in the first hour. How can anything that follows give us cause to root for the hero
when so mamy people have already died?
Also, one critic raved about a scene where
Maclain ejects from a plane shortly before it explodes : 'His nose almost TOUCHES THE SCREEN as he is blown upwards in an incredibly realistic scene'(I'm paraphrasing).
'REALISTIC'??!!?? Ya right. How about MATTE SHOT CITY?!? Forget this time-waster! I'd rather watch 'Back To the Future-Part 2' (another turkey)!",3,1,1,13 February 2019
The Dirty Dozen," Let's lock 'em in the basement and slaughter 'em.
","Boy, those crazy nazis just can't catch a break
can they? Okay, I know, they don't deserve a break anyhow. But, jeez, we've shot 'em, stabbed 'em, blown 'em up and even melted them- but they just keep comin' back. Well, at least they used to. I don't think we've had a good 'kill the nazis' movie in awhile now.
Anyway, my point is, this movie is pretty lame if you REALLY think about it. I mean, what is the goal of the mission? Lock a group of nazis and their dates in a basement and gas them.
And that's it. THAT'S IT. The real appeal of this movie is the cast-which is great. Oh, and waiting for Telly Savalas' meltdown. That's it.
5 stars for the cast, zero for plot. Thank you.",5,1,5,20 July 2019
1941," Why aren't ZERO STARS available?
","No need to go into detail about this overlong time-waster. Recommended by a friend, I took my girlfriend to see this unfunny film. Long story short, some good ideas were stretched so thin that they just weren't funny. John Belushi smashing open a whiskey bottle and pouring the contents in his face. Funny. Robert Stack sitting in a theater, crying during a cartoon. NOT funny. Not funny at all. Lots of good talent, wasted. Junk, junk, junk.",1,1,3,12 April 2020
Across the Universe," It's all TOO MUCH...
","I love Beatles music; it is (to use a hackneyed
phrase) the soundtrack of my younger years.
I rented 'A.T.U.' from Blocbuster Video in their
waning days and, at first, enjoyed the movie,
and, of course, all that Beatles music! But subsequent viewings made me realize that 33 songs by any artist is simply wayyyy too much to cram into one film; it's wretched excess.
Truly great movies hold up time after time,
viewing after viewing. But this overblown mess didn't even survive a second viewing in my home.",4,1,4,8 November 2018
Chariots of Fire," Maybe if you didn't RUN so much, you wouldn't need a knee replacement!
","Hey, that's just my humble opinion, so why should you care? I just read a 'heartwarming'
human interest story in my paper about a local 'triathlete minister' who bounced back from double knee replacement in one month to compete in triathlons again. Good for you, Padre. Did you ever consider that maybe if you'd just taken a brisk walk now and then you wouldn't have needed a knee job?!? Anyway, enjoy 'Chariots', you Run Nuts. Boring, Boring, Boring, if you don't run. I remember how the audience sat spellbound, silently at the end of the film as the Vangelis song played. The only good part.
Shoulda saved my money and bought the 45.",1,0,1,17 April 2020
Titanic," Five Stars for SPECIAL EFFECTS ONLY.
","While the entire world, it seems, was singing the praises of 'Titanic, I was regretting the time and money I'd wasted to see it on the big screen. I HATED it. Why? The lead actors and their sophomoric story, that's why. I didn't like Leo and Kate's characters. I hated Billy's character. I didn't care about any of them,
and felt numb about their eventual fate. He's dying. Who cares. Let it end so I can leave the theater. I'd like to see a version without Leo, Kate, and Billy. Just the crew and the other passengers trying to survive. Oh, and the ship,
of course. The End.",5,0,3,5 July 2020
A Hard Day's Night," ...and the girls SCREAMED SO LOUD!!!
","I saw 'A Hard Day's Night' when I was nine years old in 1964. My good friend, also a nine year-old boy like me, and I, sat with his father
during the movie. All I can remember is the girls screaming when the Beatles sang. And just when you thought they couldn't get any louder, the camera would do a closeup on one of the Beatles' faces, and the screaming rose
by 100 decibels. At least. Why only 9 stars?
Americans really, really need subtitles to catch all the Beatles' clever lines -and there are many. Also, the scene with George Harrison being interviewed for a job as a ...fashion consultant? Seems out of place and goes on too long. Otherwise, this is a great introduction to The Beatles. My girlfriend,
who is from the 'Elvis' generation, really enjoyed it too when I played the DVD for her.",9,0,0,5 May 2020
Arrival," Worst 'date movie' ever.
","Finally got the chance to take that girl from my place of employment to dinner and a movie. Saw 'Arrival'. It was dark, slow, and
bizarre. It was also our last date. Sometime later I heard her gush about seeing 'La La Land'. Not sure who she saw it with. I simply filed our near-relationship under 'wasn't meant to be'.",3,4,11,19 May 2019
Back to the Future Part II," Well, it's that time again...
","Yes, Bad Cinema fans, it's time to slam another worthless film into the dust.
A film that served no purpose other than to repeat, without success, its predecessor.
'Back To The Future - Part 2' showed us future versions of gimmicks that worked well in the first film, but fell flat in this trite sequel.
Case in point- the gas station in part one with all the uniformed attendants (hilarious) was now a robotic gas pump (not funny, although I did hear ONE PERSON in the theater say, 'Hah!').
What was the name of the bully in part one-
Moose? Bull? Whatever. But all of a sudden the movie focused on him and his story- WHO CARES?
I deliberately waited for a climactic scene to get up and leave this boring mess.
Thankfully, 'BTTF - Part 3' recaptured the old magic again. Thanks for reading.",1,1,7,27 May 2019
Tombstone," Way, way, WAY too long.
","Every time I see a certain movie on my cable guide I feel compelled to write a brief review, based on my recollections of whatever film that might be. 'Tombstone' is my choice for today, since I just saw it scheduled to play tonight on some cable channel.
My wife and I rented this endless western
from Blockbuster in the early '90's. I think we must have looked at the video cassette box more than once to double-check the running time of the film. Why, we wondered, couldn't they have cut this film by 30 minutes?
I totally don't understand all the glowing reviews for this overlong film!
Got nothing better to do for over two hours?
-then watch 'Tombstone'. Maybe you'd like to enjoy it as a double bill with 'The Natural'.
But you'd better pick up a fifty-pound bag of popcorn (unpopped) first!",3,3,12,28 April 2019
Green Book," A TRUE 'Best Picture' picture!
","'Green Book' has all you can ask for in a great film- great acting, great story, and wonderful
characters you really care about. What a terrific, feel-good movie. Just see it! That is all!",10,1,6,25 March 2019
The Great Escape," Steve McQueen leads a daring nighttime escape...in glow-in-the-dark khakis!
","Always got a kick out of McQueen leading the escapees from the tunnel while trying to stay inconspicuous in those khakis! But then, as his character says, the escape hole was opened short of the woods.
Oh, whatever. This is great 'they don't make them like that anymore' film. What a cast!
What a soundtrack! I still get goosebumps watching McQueen on that motorcycle fleeing the Germans- and the music that accompanies
that whole scene.
Still enjoying a true classic in 2018!",8,1,1,10 November 2018
