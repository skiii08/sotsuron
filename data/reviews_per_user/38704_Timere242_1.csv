The New World," Beautifully shot, but painfully boring... and arrogant
","I'm not a fan of Colin Farell, but I was drawn to this by all the hype I've heard. Well, the cinematography is captivating and stunning, and this would have made a great Discovery special on nature. However, the story moves about as fast as grass grows, and believe me there is much grass watching in this movie. It is just atrociously boring. I forced myself to watch it just to see how it ends (an unfortunate fault of mine). Well, that didn't help out much neither. Ultimately, this plays out like some anti-American propaganda of why we shouldn't be here and how we destroy everything we steal or touch. I wish I had never seen this pretentious trash of a movie and had spent my time brushing my teeth instead. Stay away; stay far away.",3,1,4,29 October 2006
