The Blair Witch Project," Still the Best
","When this movie came out, I noticed that it was a litmus test for moviegoers. Some people I know were bored out of their minds and sickened by the camera work. Others, like me, lost sleep. For weeks. And, while I dislike branding an entire species, I still honestly feel that those who despise this film have no idea what imagination really is or are far too weaned on slasher garbage. Because this is the most terrifying thing I've ever seen, and because it accomplishes this by revealing absolutely nothing. You all know it backwards, of course. Let me just add that even the disagreeable elements, like Heather's annoying as hell character, came through as utterly real. Too bad that nothing good followed this because the BWP was as devastating a masterwork as you're ever gonna get for about 30K. Or a lot more. PS What was fun was asking cynical friends who trashed it, Well, what would YOU have done? One guy told me he would've simply started running. Nobody else had any suggestions at all. I've often wondered about fire - it was damp but was there no way to kindle as big a blaze as they could?",10,6,11,26 May 2010
Black Swan," Horse Feathers
","The worst thing about the very bad 'Swan' is that, somehow, people think it's a brilliant film. The best thing is that it makes you wish somebody would really center a great film in the fascinating world of ballet. This...ain't it. I read this script was developed over ten years. Really? Ten years in which to create a cartoon, horny, bombastic company director, spouting clichés about 'passion' and 'letting go'? Ten years, and no one notices that Nina has no character at all? Ten years, and it seemed plausible that a blatantly frightened, whiny dancer should get the lead in 'Swan Lake'? Quite honestly, I kept waiting for this film to actually begin; only when the absurd death-drive ending was tacked on did I realize it was over. Utterly bad, all the way, and mostly because we get no sense of Portman's identity WHATSOEVER. More exactly, there is no foundation upon which to build either the dark side's emergence from her, OR her horror of it. Other reviews here rightly point out the idiocies, as in a star ballerina being 'fired' and in drunken shock over it, or an alternate lead selected so late in the game, or a director engaging in conduct that would get any artistic director out on his ass in a heartbeat, no matter the artsy milieu. All of that would have been bearable, had there been any notion even hinted at of what and who Nina is. Nothing. So weird stuff happens to this non-character, there's a ridiculously gratuitous lesbian fantasy, you early on don't freak over the blood because, after five minutes, you know it's in her head, and then she achieves perfection in death. And you don't care at all. PS How bad? I kept longing to see Barbra Streisand take the stage in a tutu, saying, 'You vanna kill a swvan? Dese lovelies?'",1,45,76,9 February 2012
Requiem for a Dream," Sadism as Film Genre
","You don't need to pine for nothing but old MGM musicals to be disgusted by the blatant sadism fueling movies like this. That is to say, I fully accept the tragic decline of characters in keeping with a story, nor do I object to miserable endings when the course dictates that. I'm a grown-up. But. There is something nasty going on with films like this, wherein increasingly grotesque displays of characters undergoing horror are presented as 'reality', or, God help us, art. No good storyteller in any medium actually needs to show us, inch by inch, how low his characters are going. As in this dreadful, pretentious movie. Reviews here sensibly bring out the absurd mistakes, like Burstyn's Etc without anaesthesia or the drug dealer's ridiculous giving away of heroin for a little sex, yet seem to miss that these absurdities are there to serve the director's sadistic purpose: to make everyone suffer really badly, and right in front of us. That is not film-making. That is an adolescent's idea of being shocking and gritty, and it's insulting all around. Give me a story that realistically portrays these very dreams falling apart, with some humanity and not as an exercise in visual cruelty, and I'm on board. This? It's prurient garbage under the guise of serious movie-making.",2,4,7,16 June 2010
Skyfall," Ah, Yes. Old School
","Here's the drill - if you're like me, you gave up on Bond when Sean left, because his two prominent replacements were far too sleek, feminine, etc. Bond needs to be played by a man's man and Craig (who is far less handsome than Connery) is perfect. He understands the dimension in this seemingly one-dimensional character. But what makes this film just wonderful is old- fashioned momentum, with just enough action. This is new Bond that nearly outshines the classics. Are there issues? A few. Never mind. There is a fabulous villain, perhaps more understandable in his evil than those of the past, and intriguingly as suicidal as he is murderous. Most astounding of all is the spin on the Bond girl. She is perfection in fear and beauty, and I found it remarkable that this 'classic' had the guts to deviate from the form in making her appearance so brief.",9,1,8,25 February 2013
Marie Antoinette," Let 'Em Eat Really Bad Cake
","There are absolutely stunning sets here, truly amazing recreations of Versailles. There are costumes - and shoes, oh, yes, shoes! - so sumptuous you may pass out. There are some very fine actors involved, and there is excellent art direction. But there is, sadly, no movie. No movie at all. What there is, is a solid 90 minutes of waiting to see if MA's marriage gets consummated, and even this is a tiresome, completely not erotic affair. That's about it. Oh - Dunst really does play the role like a Valley girl, all the way, which I hear was meant to 'modernize' the subject for young audiences. It's an adolescent contrivance in a pointless film, and what burns me up the most is this kind of budget spent on a laughably inept script, in the hands of a director better suited to MTV. This is the hopelessly juvenile 'Moulin Rouge' school of filmmaking and, if you can sit through this insulting garbage easily, you are far more patient than I.",1,3,4,20 July 2010
The Ring," This Ring is Solid
","What you get here is a stylish horror film that is, stunningly, better than the Japanese original. Are there plot holes here and there? Sure. Is the kid annoying? Absolutely. Do we need a little old lovers' conflict brought up, or young dad anxiety? Nope. None of that hurts the movie, really, chiefly because of Watts' wonderful performance and, again, the style. It is easy, in fact, to make light of 'The Ring' because of association with all the rip-offs afterward. But - it's just damn good. It moves in a fine arc, presents truly creepy visuals, and goes where it needs to go. As a plus, Noah, the ex, is hot. You even get the marvelous Jane Alexander. 'The Ring' isn't absolutely brilliant, but it's the best American horror film to come along in a long, long, long time.",Null,1,1,3 November 2011
Alien: Resurrection," Joss, Yes - Resurrection, NO
","This gets a whopping 4 from me only because Whedon's script has Whedon moments. Otherwise, it is a dismal end to what began as innovative, captivating sci/fi horror. Everything about this film screams exploitation, and I am deeply amused at the recurring statement that Weaver only agreed to do the film because of the emotional medical unit scene; I kind of thought the $11 million persuaded her. Clearly, budget problems interfered, and it shows. There is a Disney-esque look to the aliens, especially in the underwater sequences. Worst of all, though, is the dreadful, knowing, irritating clone played by Ripley. I remember thinking that A3, while flawed, was at least a legitimate end to sequels. Too bad. 1 was inspired and stunning. 2 delivered, albeit in schlockmeister Cameron's hands. 3 had a morbidity that gave it integrity. This...the whole damn team wanted to make a buck, and it annoys the hell out of me that they mask this greed as a new 'vision'.",4,1,2,4 June 2011
Cloverfield," Go, Monster, Go!
","Oh, my. My, my. Here I was, expecting an interestingly modern monster movie. What I got was...I don't quite know. I only know I kept leaving the sofa to do something else, saying out loud, 'Oh, come ON, already.' And I have to say, after the first 5 minutes of the opening party scene, I was already cheering for whatever monster was coming. I was rather hoping he'd hurry, too. To be fair, people truly are that tiresome and annoying. They do act like their romances are life-and-death. But this does not especially make me want to see if they can survive hell. What else? Little things. Like, the band of 'heroes' apparently walks from Spring St. to 59th Street through the tunnels? Three miles, one subway tunnel, and the critters, too? Hot damn. Or that no one is insistent that the girl literally ripped apart by the bug get medical attention when they astoundingly walk into a makeshift hospital, because the hero has to explain about his trapped GF first? Or that, traumatized or not, the surviving hero and GF seem to forget that the city's about to be nuked? Or that Hud, the cameraman, is the most severely irritating idiot ever? Or that, as noted elsewhere, the U.S, military is on the scene in full force minutes after the first attack, which ties into why lots of people would think it smart to traverse a bridge when buildings are flying? Ultimately, though, it all comes down to: you just care nothing at all for these people, and the pitiful rescue-the-beloved angle only makes it worse. PS Manhattan, nuked? I'm OK with that.",1,0,1,13 December 2011
Shutter Island," Old-fashioned, Satisfying Quality
","These days it's unusual to leave a movie feeling perfectly satisfied and glad you came. Thank you, 'Shutter Island'. I won't relate story here; no need. Nor will I say much about Scorcese except that, thank God, he had a fine story to work with, and that's all he needs to be masterful. The performances are uniformly excellent, too. What I want to address are the critics - some respected and erudite - who seem to feel that any shifting of a necessarily complex tale at the end is a 'cheat'. Trust me - SI brings it all home and almost exactly right. So too do these same critics love to have fun with Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow playing, it seems, any roles at all. Reviews have had much fun with Kingsley's mysterious persona, and Von Sydow's austere presence. This is garbage. Both men never overplay, certainly not here, and deliver top work. I suppose they're guilty of looking and sounding like...well, who they are. Never mind, though. This is a marvelous, enjoyable, at times gripping movie. Bravo.",9,1,3,19 June 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," Tame, Tame, Tame. Some Fun.
","What makes DWP work as a bland, comfort film is what makes it not work as anything close to a good movie: namely, the paint-by-numbers script. Everything is rote, from the obligatory crew of friends (Black, gay, boyfriend) to the really awful story transitions that actually come from nowhere; you're just expecting them because that's how these tales go, and not because the script properly sets them up. That is, based on friend and boyfriend reactions, Hathaway has become a work-obsessed, different person. It's supposedly what's driving the story, this alteration of her nature. But we don't get this. Yeah, she looks good and performs an impossible job at ridiculous hours, but she remains her sweet self. Yet, to hammer home this drastic 'character change', the lame device of having her repeat that she 'had no choice' is employed. A lot. The contrivance is embarrassing and pointless because she has not changed as a character. Oh, well. La Streep is La Streep. Always amazing (except for that mess, 'Mamma Mia!', which God Himself couldn't save). PS More points off for the two truly absurd jobs Hathaway is supposed to perform (hurricane flight and Potter books). It would've been far more real had the challenges been more earthbound.",4,0,1,10 March 2010
Oblivion," Old-Fashioned, Solid Sci-Fi
","Yes, it borrows lots from 'Total Recall', 'Matrix', etc. Yes, there are plot holes. Yes, there's the obligatory futuristic dwelling with impossibly gleaming floors and Danish Modern furniture. But this is simply a well-made sci-fi epic, and that's a rare beast these days (see my review of the ghastly 'Prometheus'). It could use a little editing to tighten and better set up the big plot surprise, which I confess threw me; I thought it was a temporal issue. Still, Cruise does his Cruise thing very well, Sally is wonderfully menacing, the concepts were fresh or freshened, the last 30 minutes keeps you nicely fixated, and, most amazing of all, Morgan Freeman isn't annoying in his Mystical Black Man turn.",8,2,5,30 April 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Better Than Fair(y)
","Let me say right here that the damning reviews for this are solid evidence for why I gave up on critics years ago. This is NOTHING MORE than campy, surreal, visually-entertaining fun, and it offends me how big-name reviewers both attack its lack of dimension (?) and get things wrong, to boot. Time's Corliss, for example, notes that Edward the Troll saves Gretel because he is impelled to pity humans. Uh..no. Listen to his line, for God's sake. That arch-hack Rex Reed refers several times to multiple gang rapes. As someone who won't go near a film with a rape in it, I can safely assert that he is very off-base. Nothing new there. I will concede one point: wittier dialogue would have been very welcome. Nonetheless. This is precisely as fun in a moderate way as you have the right to expect it to be. And please ignore critics who seem to think pointing out the incongruity of high-tech weapons in Feudal settings indicates how clever they are.",8,0,1,8 July 2013
Mamma Mia!," Meryl, Meryl - WHY?
","In a word - friends told me to see this. They said it was great fun, a truly enjoyable, giddy musical. They are no longer friends of mine.From the first few minutes, this is just plain awful. Having made it through most of this mess, I can only speculate that people believe that a screen full of girls and boys and men and women jumping about with crazed smiles for a couple of hours is what constitutes energy and fun in a movie. To me, it constitutes a desperate frenzy of fakery. EVERYTHING is forced, EVERY laugh - and there are two million - is over-the-top, and EVERYTHING is rammed down your throat, a marked contrast to the breezy confidence of the great MGM musicals. Not even the enormously watchable Christine Baranski can save herself in this sloppy mess of ceaseless, frenetic bilge.PS The setting did bring to mind Cassavetes' 'Tempest', a clinker of another genre. Somebody, please - the Greek islands deserve a break.",2,2,2,26 October 2009
Bridesmaids," Too Bad
","This might have been a decent film, had the people behind it had ANY sense of pacing and character development. Or a firm idea of what movie they were out to make: heartfelt chick flick or gross-out farce. That's all there is to it, really - a little talent not compensating for big talent missing. For instance: Annie is just too dense to be sympathetic. From the start, we see her screwing a loser because -hang on - she has esteem issues. But it's too, too contrived because the guy is so repulsive. Then, we're given no reason why she abandoned her love of baking, except that the trauma of losing her store (maybe) killed her passion. Too, too textbook. Worst of all, the adorable, caring cop is dismissed BECAUSE the writer and director expect you to accept that this is what self-destructive gals do. Not because of some interesting revelation of her character, or anything. I did enjoy the gross farce, and the jewelry store humor. Over-the-top, but fun. Again, though, it comes down to creative staff actually not knowing HOW TO CONSTRUCT a solid, well-made film. I call it the Tim Burton curse; all they can do is throw together interesting scenes and uninteresting scenes.",4,7,12,18 January 2012
Django Unchained," Blazing Saddles Unchained
","This is teenage garbage, plain and simple, and teenage in terms of the director/writer. Let's set aside that Tarantino's movies never have any substance and are exercises in retro, gory, fetishist camp. Let's ignore that the story arc is off and the film is way too long. Also, that there are massive issues regarding all kinds of credibility. Which leaves the two main problems with this adolescent mess. The first is: what would you say about any film centered on two races of people, in which one race is, with a single exception, shown to be nothing but a vast collection of savage, cruel, stupid buffoons? That's what QT happily does to the white race in this, his attack on racism. Then, there's the blatant theft of Mel Brooks's 'Blazing Saddles' in the many n-word remarks geared for laughs and the idiot pre- Klansmen. Never was a big Brooks fan, but at least he never had the gall to pretend he was making a statement.",1,68,122,25 April 2013
Insidious," Close to Excellent....
","It's too bad when Wan goes along beautifully and then loses his grip. That's the only real problem here, and kindly ignore reviews trashing the acting, etc. It's uniformly solid, with believable leads, and Wilson nicely avoids what could be a 'pretty boy' trap. The scares begin and build creatively, and the direction keeps you in pace with the victims. Yes, the whole idea is 'Poltergeist', but absolutely everything's been done before anyway, and what matters is the novelty of approach. This film brings it. Sadly, the rescue of the boy in the Further is just too, too protracted, and relies too much on stock horror nightmare props. I'd have preferred plain murky, for why would these lost souls be so fetishistic over scary dolls and creepy music? This is a dimension, after all, and not a realm within a person's mind, which might explain those elements. And...I wanted a happy ending. Sorry. But I did. All that said, however, it's highly watchable and light years better than all the slasher/sadism porn calling itself horror.",8,0,1,24 September 2013
2012," End of the World? Fine, If It Means No More '2012's
","It is no small accomplishment to film a movie about the end of the world and make absolutely all of it very, very boring. Hats off to '2012'. Like some others, I rented this for sheer kicks. I got kicked, all right. From John Cusack - apparently Hollywood's poster boy for divorced, cynical writers who come through at the end - desperately trying to stay afloat in absolutely horrific dialogue (yes, his ex takes a moment as the world is ripping apart to remind him that he had 'blocked' his family), to Woody Harrelson's awful acting as the crackpot who knows the truth - and you just know he's howling with glee at having been paid a lot of money to do this junk - to pseudo-scientific rationales that choose to utterly ignore how the erupting of Yellowstone alone would plunge the Earth into years of darkness, to insulting racial stereotypes like you would not believe, to the ultimate infuriation of the leads embracing in meaningful relationship babble as seconds remain to fix the ark before everybody's doomed...it's all one extravagant and unwatchable mess. And what's really astounding is how steadfastly boring the movie is. The world is shattering and you are begging for, maybe, one decent scene to come along. Or a quake to knock out your TV.",1,27,43,28 June 2010
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-cruciating
","I made the mistake of getting this on DVD, which haunts me. That said - reader, I beg you: trust me. This is soulless hack work, as only a talentless twit like Brett Ratner could produce. That I knew and loved the books is beside the point; I can appreciate that a film must take liberties. I can appreciate as well that Bryan Singer, a few flaws notwithstanding, knew how to find the heart in these tales. It is ironic that a horror from the first two movies - Berry's utterly absurd portrayal of storm - is here nearly a nostalgic comfort. Because all of this is a mess. We are expected to believe lots of things far more unreal than mutant abilities, such as Magneto turning his back on Mystique because the 'cure' reverts her to human form. OUT OF CHARACTER, and rather stupid for the brilliant Erik, who knew the lady's resourcefulness. Or Magneto idiotically egging on the deranged Phoenix as though he had no idea of what she could do, as he and Charles visit Jean. Or Jean's mad impulse to turn Scott to dust, when, in movie and books, her love for Scott saves her from Phoenix insanity. Or that Wolverine's healing power is just so bad-ass, it enables him to near the galactic killing force Jean becomes (and no nonsense about her 'letting' this happen, please- the character is a zombie). Or - oh, hell, it's everywhere and everything. Worst of all, though, is the lifelessness of it. A few actors try, but can't get past the dead atmosphere. On the plus side, the girl playing Kitty looks right, and you have to love Multiple Man who has, I think, one line, when Magneto (whom he does not know) recruits him: 'Sounds good to me!' That's it for the plus side.",1,0,2,4 June 2011
The Mist," the missed
","(Sorry for the title - I'm sure it's elsewhere here.) Maybe the saddest thing about this mess is that King supposedly loved it. There goes any hope of his being a victim of awful Hollywood. Anyway. The deal is, King is a talented hack. Which is fine; he has great moments and a lot of repetitive junk. But 'The Mist' was simply a fun, really good, scary story. The movie begins with potential, then screws up. BADLY. As noted here a lot, the religious frenzy was just too, too much. Even people that terrified would not so readily become mindless zombies, and this plot device drives, God help us, the second half of this too long film. Now, the ending - again, loved by SK. The problem isn't its darkness. The problem with it is its hopeless absence of any sense. OK, they're all in rough shape, but these are four smart people in the car. They know the area very well. They know that cars run out of gas. So, no one suggests heading to a shelter more secure than the supermarket? Or to a gun store (it's Maine, after all), or counting on the gun they have to buy the time needed to get gas? Tension and dread aside, it's insane to think that all of them would sit silently, banking only on enough fuel to get them out of the danger.",3,0,2,28 July 2012
Million Dollar Baby," Oh, Baby!
","Crap. Plain and simple, and it doesn't matter how many morons think this is the finest film ever. I will give Eastwood a little credit - just a little - for knowing how to shoot a scene. He really ought to, given his career. But I do not at all understand how he's been elevated to the status of 'brilliant director', especially since his films are plagued by dreadful clichés and just plain idiot story points. You know what this is about. No need to dredge that up again. However, nothing screams more about how inept Eastwood is than the fact that it feels like half this movie is devoted to Swank's bedridden misery. It is so, so overdone that it undercuts the power that might have been there, settling instead to force tears from a sheer and relentless pounding in of the nightmare scenario. On the plus side, Swank is OK. Eastwood does what he always did, which is play nothing. And I believe this movie comes midpoint in Morgan Freeman's career as the weary, wise Black man. Would somebody give this guy a job in a comedy? Please?",2,0,4,16 June 2010
Evil Dead," The Evil Robbery
","This gets 2 only because the premise had promise; interesting, that no one would believe the girl who encounters a demon because she's withdrawing. Not great, not original, but OK. However. That's it, and the reviews here praising this idiot slasher crap seem to feel it's worthy of being a genre itself - that is, moronic scenes setting up mutilation. I don't get it. I don't get why the dude feels the urgent need to read aloud the words in the forbidden book, especially as he reveals having some respect for this sort of thing. Don't get how a Wal- Mart carving blade can slice through bone or how a girl does not immediately bleed to death after. Then again, nobody bleeds realistically here. Back to the lovers of this: are you seriously claiming that inane reactions make a movie work, as in the ABSURD (and tired) moments of emotional pause when the demon takes the brother down memory lane, or the idiot blonde goes into the cellar cause Mia sounds kinda scared? Worst of all is the math. The book makes it clear: five souls taken, then the real abomination comes with the blood rain. Four, demon. You only got four. Nurse, brother, idiot blonde, and book dude. But I'm wasting everyone's time. Slasher porn, and really bad even for that adolescent 'genre'.",2,2,5,12 October 2013
Clash of the Titans," Clash of the Mythologies
","The thing is, the first one was completely cheesy, and that was fine. It was enjoyable junk. In this...well, everyone's determined to play this seriously, and that is a very large mistake. To begin with: given the rich action in all Greek myth, it seems kind of unnecessary and stupid to rewrite it. The Kraken was a Norse creature, and Zeus never ordered such a beast from his brother. OK, you know that. Still - why? There are tons of monsters and titans to pull from. Then, Worthington. He tries (a little), but I can't get past the marine hair. It's like he slipped into the skirt on a break from 'Avatar'. But at least he's got the legs for it. Ultimately, this just isn't much fun. The CGI is all right, but both the Potter franchises and peter Jackson could sue; in fact, I truly thought Hades was Lord V all over again. Note to producers: next time, make Sam play it naked, or don't bother filming the rubbish. PS Last time I checked, Io was a cow, transformed from a maiden for her own protection. Oh, well. PPS As annoying as Brit accents are in sword fantasies, Worthington's Aussie accent is just silly.",Null,1,2,6 November 2011
Paranormal Activity," One Trick Pony
","Ah, 'Blair Witch'. Nothing will touch you. This film, though, tries. Succeeds...a little. Essentially, one thing, and one thing only, works here, and it's a spin on the hand-held footage genre: the bedroom filming. This truly is suspense, for the seconds count away and you look from the door to the bed, back to the door and the hallway, waiting. It's wonderful. It's just too bad that a better film weren't wrapped around it. Micah and Kate are OK, and do the 'real' thing adequately. Yes, you wonder: mid-twenties, she's a student, he's a day trader, and they have this really nice three-bedroom house? And why would even young people with some money rent/own a three-bedroom? How is it always beautifully clean? It's like porn, when you realize the set is the producer's actual house; no couple that young would have the spare bedrooms so nicely furnished, or the collection of outdoor furniture clearly gathered over years. Then - after a certain point, there's no way they're not getting some help there. Surely there's more than one demonologist in CA? Or: maybe, after the thing drags her out of the bed by the ankles, it might be smart to sleep in turns. Or arrange to have friends over at various times, in shifts. Or put a tent in the yard, see what the beastie can do outdoors. Or, if you must sleep together, MAYBE HAVE KATIE SWITCH SIDES SO SHE'S NOT EXPOSED TO THE DOOR. All this is what drove me crazy, because the potential was there. I just can't accept that the returning ghost hunter, terrified of being inside that house, would tell Katie that his demonologist friend will be 'back in a few days', or that Micah, after the night of the footprints and photograph, tells K that there's no need to call in expert help. All in all, the real scare is how your own imagination wishes you were making this, because so much could've been done to bring on subtle, realistic terror. Last word: skip the alternate ending. The theatrical one is far, far better.",Null,1,2,15 October 2011
Elysium," Elysium: Foster Gains Paycheck
","Stock. Plain and simple, mindless, 'futuristic', action stock. All through this archly predictable nonsense, I was keenly aware that Damon and Foster were cast because Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver are too old. Now, let's see - issues? There's a big difference between a wealthy subculture protecting its privilege and one denying untold numbers of dying people miraculous medical technology. When the lower half of a head is blown off, it's likely that the brain will be hurt too, and, again, that is some FANCY medical machinery. It seems silly to have an isolated enclave for the rich in space when anyone can fly in from ugly Earth AND there're about no more than 2 droid/cops on hand to deal with intruders. Add to this list characters with no dimension, and you get...well, at least Jodie Foster got paid. She earned it for the most bizarre accent to hit the screen since Martin Short's wedding planner.",2,3,8,28 December 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Notes to Mr. Burton
","<ul><li>Your wife makes the movie come alive, although you unwisely move her away from caricature as the movie goes on. - What is the point of 'Underland'? Is this your coy way of saying you don't have to be faithful to the book? - We know you do whacky, fun visuals. Really, we do. They still don't actually make a movie where there is no movie. - As wild as you are about Depp, was it necessary to give the Hatter a bizarre, and occasional, Scots presence? - Setting up your Alice as a clunky, whiny heroine is not smart. - Do you sort of hate women, in that Alice and Hathaway's White Queen must look like they've been dead for a few weeks? Is Kate Moss your idea of an attractive young lady? - A cat that grins and speaks should be intriguing enough. You don't need to have him pop in and out like Nightcrawler in the X-Men, or spin through the air every minute. In fact, the cat is always more ominous just reclining on a branch. - Last thought: WHY reinvent the story, anyway? Why not just give us a definitive, beautiful, haunting 'Alice' and leave Narnia battles to Narnia?</li></ul>",4,2,5,21 November 2010
Avatar," King of the World?...Uh, Sure.
","I tried. I really tried. I started watching. Then I was kind of lost, as the dialogue was as trite as every other marine-going-into-conflict garbage I've ever heard. I assumed it was a joke, then understood it was not. Then I thought, it'll get better. Then Sigourney Weaver came on and proved yet again that she's a really dismal actor. She is so awfully artificial, it's painful. Then the blue things came on, and I tried, but I soon realized that these effects were the film's big attractions. No, I couldn't watch much more. Cameron is utterly tired and wearily predictable, and the only, and I mean, ONLY thing that could've made this macho/sci fi mess bearable would have been Sam Worthington playing naked.",Null,2,4,15 October 2011
Mama," Truly Good - Could've Been Great
","It's so frustrating to finally see a horror film that could be something rare and wonderful - a lovely horror film - and then watch it fall short because of a few key mistakes. First off, this is good. Really good. Bored beyond measure by today's emphasis on visuals, I feel the art and graphics here are stunning and different. The acting is high, high quality straight through, with the possible exception of the thankless role of the sister-in-law. The story itself is mythic and haunting. Best of all is Chastain's arc from (believable) rock chick to mom. How great it would have been, had the trajectory simply built on the growing rivalry between the two female forces. It does to a degree, but it goes off in sad places. As in silly, easily avoidable plot and character lapses: why would the doctor not warn Annabel (it couldn't hurt his agenda), and no hubris brings a lone man to that cabin at night, knowing what he knows. Or: the dumb, late night appearance of the sister-in-law. Aaaaargh. Then - why introduce the father's spirit only once? Is he not as strong a ghost as Mama? Lastly, utterly unforgivable is Luke's rising at the end, after Mama hand-spears him. I didn't want him dead, but dead is better than an actor having to play that, 'huh, what happened?' moment. Still. The ending is nicely set up (and borrows beautifully from 'The Uninvited'), and actually affecting emotionally. How many horror movies can make that claim? As said, this is so close to greatness, it makes you angry.",7,1,2,26 May 2013
Super 8," New Horror Feature! Spielberg Feeds on Himself! Again!
","This gets a 3 only because of Elle Fanning's performance. The rest...please. Having now seen 'Cloverfield' and this, I feel very justified in having disliked Abrams' pretentious, awful skyrocket to fame, 'Lost'. This film is nothing more than an expensive link in the chain of Spielbergian schlock, and I am way, way weary of his endlessly repetitive tricks. Yes, I know he didn't direct, but it doesn't matter; he's been an industry forever, and his plant spews out the same, button- pushing garbage all the time. We have young kids being 'real'. We have parental angst. We have last-minute, soulful bonding. We have a misunderstood alien. We have comic relief stoner dude, and we have arch villain from the military. Etc., etc. If this isn't insulting enough, there's the really, really absurd situation of a man surviving driving into a massive freight train going full speed, AND a supposedly intelligent deputy hinting to Evil Military Dude that he's onto their secrets, and he wants answers, damn it. Ultimately: enough, Amblin. You have been making the same movie for 30 years now, and it's not getting any better.",3,1,2,29 December 2011
Sinister," Nicely Creepy
","Why all the disparagement here? Why the fierce objections to found footage once again used as a plot device? Virtually every device in all genres has been endlessly employed - what matters is if the film works, and this film works. Ethan Hawke is believable as the tortured author, and he thankfully does not overplay the angst card. The wife is a thankless role, but such wives in such movies usually are. The point is, the story unfolds at a nice pace, and the use of the footage is just downright chilling. I take 2 points off for the hero's failure to connect some fairly obvious dots, regarding his own children and the kids of the murdered families; seriously, the daughter's knowledge and painting of the missing Stephanie was a massive alert. Nonetheless, and while no work of art, 'Sinister' is an engaging and well-crafted horror flick. PS No happy ending here.",8,1,1,12 October 2015
The Descent," Bats
","What bothered me the most here - aside from the darkness which, if 'realistic', annoyingly confuses the action - is that there's no momentum beyond the body count thing. This is due to the regrettable fact that, the lead woman excepted a little, the women are interchangeable and have no defining characters at all. So - when 3 gets in trouble, it may as well be 2. Back to the darkness, now: please. We get the idea, really, but we would still like to have some sense of what the hell is going on in which tunnel, and to whom. If only to also identify characters. I realize that a film like this certainly shouldn't hand us cliché characters for the sake of stamping them as individuals, but a little good writing early on would've done the job, and we would then care. As for the tech elements, no go. The creatures were strangely toothless and nailless for hunting beasts that take down large prey all the time. It's also hard to believe a spelunking expert would lead 5 (6?) others into an unknown cave for the thrill of it. Lastly, I truly don't get the Carrie ending at all. Seems like they felt that a shock was essential, set the girl in the front seat, and figured the audience can supply the...meaning.",4,1,4,12 December 2012
"Hail, Caesar!"," Why, Caesar?
","If you're like me at all, you'll still be waiting for the film to begin when the closing credits role. On the plus side, you have an awful lot of stars who seem to be having fun. You have a glossy production and some elegantly slangy, period dialogue. What you don't have is pace of any kind, nor momentum, nor any honest idea of what the point is beyond lampooning/paying homage to old Hollywood. The themes, apart from Brolin's character as conflicted by a job offer, are hopelessly obtuse. Is it about communist writers seeking a new society? Swell, but this ignores the reality that many communist-affiliated screenwriters both earned high salaries and had no intention of destroying the system. OK, set that aside. There still remains muddle in a big way, as in lengthy recreations of period movie scenes that do not move the story whatsoever, nor go anywhere else, and defy era. What year is this? The adverts claim it's the 1950s but this is wholly irrational. In what year were Esther Williams-style swimming movies made along with singing cowboy films? MOST egregiously: in no Hollywood musical in which sailors sing and dance about a lack of women does the choreography involve them dry-humping one another. Not that I've seen, anyway. I also wonder in what universe Tatum deserves stardom, just as it is highly bizarre that a communist movie star would, in the midst of his career, leave for Moscow in a submarine. Ehrenbeich is, I admit, truly wonderful as the singing cowboy, but this alone cannot save a self-indulgent mess of a film. Coens, really, now.",1,17,28,11 February 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail, Garbage
","Before I die, I'd like someone to explain to me why the Coens are so revered. This offering, I grant you, lacks the usual scenes of sadism they like toss in. But that's pretty much all it's got going for it. First off, there's no story. None, and Clooney's being seduced by commie screenwriters is not a story. Then...what decade is this? Brolin uses a 1930s phone, the musical numbers are MGM late 1940s, and there's a singing cowboy star who would not be a star in the 1940s. THEN - the pastiche numbers. I've seen lots of Gene Kelly/sailor dancing films. Basically, I kept waiting for a movie to start. One never did.",1,1,5,27 January 2018
The Conjuring," Solid, All the Way (Except for the Ghosts)
","What makes this film great is that it builds on old-fashioned cinema values usually tossed out in horror movies. No stupid behavior from the characters. No gratuitous scenes. Believable reactions, as in the marvelous moment when the mom, scared but searching the home, yells at whatever is rattling around. Add stylish filmmaking and Bathsheba, and you're good to go. Beyond this, Wan is beginning to expand what horror can be - basically, and I've always felt this, it's a genre in which all other genres can exist. Put another way, it's simply drama when it's done well, as solid story and characters evolve and confront shifting realities. Lecture done. Let me just end by saying how much I loved and appreciated - at last! - an ending not ambiguous.",9,0,2,27 October 2013
Prometheus," Trash of the Titan
","For over 30 years, I've believed that no worse movie could be made than 'Can't Stop the Music'. I was wrong. And it breaks my 'Alien'-loving heart. WHO WROTE THIS GARBAGE, and what were they smoking? Listen up: I'm perfectly ready to suspend disbelief, esp. when it comes to sci-fi. I was also not wanting or expecting another 'Alien', as superb as it was. But this thing is, to quote Dorothy Parker, not just bad. This is fancy. A huge, huge problem is borrowing 'Alien' motifs when they do not at all apply. For instance, the crew of motley, disgruntled folks of Prometheus. Such a crew was perfect for a mining ship coming back from a dull and long job; when it's mankind's first, trillion-dollar search for life in the universe, a team seemingly pulled out of a Hooter's Happy Hour seems inappropriate. Similarly, we get the 'Alien' captain, here bad-ass but still just out to earn a paycheck. On THIS mission? It's as though Scott so valued these elements, he had to re-use them even when they utterly do not belong. Then. There's the helmets-off idiocy on the alien moon, prompted by a computer reading that the air is OK, nicely ignoring that maybe scientists would nonetheless by wary in so unknown an environment/atmosphere. There's the wretched cliché of the ancient trillionaire. There's about an hour of exposition featuring the evil gay robot who, after plainly sabotaging the womb of Dr. Shaw, is buddied up to by her not long after. Best of all are the oddly redneck two scientists, stranded, and a coaxing of an alien cobra-like creature as though it were a kitten. This is so ghastly, I felt sorry for the actor, as I did for the geologist, setting foot on a new moon and angry that he's expected to take any interest in the proceedings. This goes to an even larger flaw, in that, aside from a few, requisite gasps, everyone is reacting to this extraordinary find as though they stumbled into a funky part of town. To that end, and more horrifying than the scientist-kitten, is Holloway's pouty, drunken angst because, gee, there weren't no daddy aliens to explain why man exists. He has found an incredible alien civilization and proof of humanoid life but, like a true scientist, he can't get past not getting his boyish dream fulfilled. Also; he awakes to discover a creeping worm in his freaking eye, tells no one, and simply goes off on the day's mission? Who wrote this garbage? Last issue: there is NO momentum. There is no tension or suspense. There isn't even a second- rate 'Alien' prequel, because this thing would have to work real hard to be second-rate.",1,119,196,27 June 2012
1408," Maybe Not a GREAT Room, But...
","The big - and it's BIG - problem with this film as a horror/suspense flick is simple, and it's all a spoiler: the set-up is far too overdone and the hotel room doesn't begin to live up to it. We're told of horrors so consistently unspeakable that guest after guest mutilates, blinds, castrates himself or herself. A lot. One maid gouged out her eyes after merely moments in the bathroom. And the bulk of the movie simply can't deliver anything that would remotely bring such extremes on. OK, Cusack sees painful ghosts from his past. He also has (harmless)phantoms swinging axes at him and others walking past him to defenestrate themselves yet again. Everything else - chiefly the rooms altered dimensions and implosion - are pretty much triggered by his own actions. As absurd as it sounds, I finished watching, thinking: it ain't all that bad a suite, really. Moreover, again, the filmmakers went way, way too far in promising unheard of nightmare experience. PS Oh, Mr. King. Please. Enough with the cynical writer/hero who wants to write Real Literature but settles for hack work. PPS IF this room has claimed that many lives, why didn't the manager insist on checking in with Cusack every hour or so? Oh - and all anyone had to do was set a fire in the room?",5,0,0,8 March 2010
X2: X-Men United," Ah, Bryan
","A lifelong X fan (until the '90s, when glossy soap opera took over the books), I give enormous credit to Singer, and for one reason: he treats his mutants with respect. He also knows how to pace action sequences beautifully, and not exploit crashes and burns. Finally, he did something stunning, in that he presents a mutant sacrifice in a way that is truly heart-wrenching, as Jean makes her choice. Are there problems? You bet. Chiefly, 'stormy' ones. I understand that a character need not absolutely reflect the book version. Play with some personalities. But - make Berry read one damn book, please. Ororo is not a hip young woman. She is an aristocrat, and this portrayal would have given needed style to the film. Along those lines, and with no disrespect to Gandalf, Magneto is supposed to be a HOT older man; a great part of his power to draw an army to him lies in his physical attractiveness. Then: why, if Jean could manifest Phoenix-like abilities one minute outside of the downed jet, was she unable to do so one minute earlier, inside the jet? And the shock/tears fest with Scott and Wolvie afterward was overkill, and embarrassing. But - heck with it. It's a fine X movie, all told.",8,0,1,4 June 2011
Lucy," 'If Lucy be lousy...'
","(Title is Shakespeare, FYI.) And, yes, Lucy is lousy. I'm sure a million reviews here have had a blast with the ridiculous '10% of the brain' premise. Personally, my objections (also likely share by many) go to: Morgan Freeman. ENOUGH. We know you're the go-to God figure and it's extremely tired. Then, and worse, is the irritating shift in style. The audience putting up with the pseudo-science-spirituality garbage has the right to expect that Lucy will spectacularly kick the bad guy asses at the end. But, noooo. Instead, Lucy, who could in a heartbeat save a bunch of lives, goes time travelin'. Most annoying of all is the 'Contact' nonsense about how humanity may not be ready for so much knowledge. Ya think? Ultimately, this is way pretentious bilge.",2,1,5,27 January 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Close. Cigar Withheld.
","(Read PS first, if you please.) This final HP halfway makes it. Yes, we all love HP. Yes, all the films have been done with great style. Still, there was an onus on DH2, and Yates (and screenplay) miss here and there. - On the plus side, Radcliffe finally becomes a real actor. - On the plusser side, Rickman is BRILLIANT and he was robbed of a supporting Oscar. - Bad news (and, as with other quibbles, the movies should stand independently from the books): Bellatrix. She is equal to Vol in sheer evil, and she is grossly responsible for many gleeful murders and tortures. It's fine to have Molly kill her, but the moment was far, far too brief. This needed to be real revenge, to satisfy fans so hating of LeStrange. - The Kings Cross limbo. Egad. I know it's in the book, I know Albus needs to redeem himself to Harry, but the device was annoying and trite. - The Ravenclaw ghost scene was far too protracted. Yes, there had to be suspense about getting this horcrux, but it felt overdone. - Dumbledore's mysterious past and hunger for power: why allude to it strongly, then leave nothing answered? It was like the Bagstock presence in DH1. We movie watchers knew it was important, but the film did not clarify how. - Finally, the end. In LOTR, Jackson understood the audience needed to hear Frodo stop in wonderment, that the ring was gone. Same thing. When the 3 friends are kicking stones around, there had to be SOME expression relating that a vast doom that's haunted them all (and the world) was gone. Not too much, mind you, but some astonishment from Harry, certainly. - Epilogue. So, it was all about the kids? Generation Next? How dull. Better to have only referred to Harry's naming his son after Severus, which was right and touching. PS More bad: how, if you don't read the book, can you rationalize Harry being alive after the forest? All we know is The Vol throws the killing spell, not the kill-unintentional-horcrux spell. Also - far too much of gratuitous, aimless running around of students during and before the battle. Seriously. These kids all acted like they had no idea of what was going on, and were utterly defenseless. Oh, yes: the script itself. It's pretty weak. Maybe Neville's awful speech is how teens talk, but this needed to be stunning, not trite. PS Read the books. Egad. Makes Helena Ravenclaw's ghost worse here, and why on earth is she referring to a 'boy' who wanted to destroy the diadem in the past, when there was no need to destroy it before Riddle, the boy, got it to begin with? Lots of mistakes now really glaring, and the lamest part of the film is that it fails to explain Harry's sacrifice properly, as it echoed his mother's. WHY, oh, why, did they not want the tension of the final duel in the film, and that wonderful bit with Harry calling V by his real name, and schooling him? This humiliation of V then makes his quick death all right. I know a film must make changes, but to ignore the very best of the book is just plain criminal.",6,2,3,11 June 2012
300," Could Turn You Straight, It's So Bad
","I watched this only because a friend told me it was stunning. I had seen previews and thought, Well, this looks like gay crap presented as high- tech warrior crap. I was right. Friend, wrong. I don't mind a mindless, fun movie, honestly. What I object to is pretension on this level. The Spartans appeared to be a nation of psychopaths with subscriptions to International Male. The writing is beyond cliché. The slo-mo is o....ver....done. It frightens me that a few glossy visuals lead people to think they are watching a good film, because this is anything but good. Also - and I'm no expert on ancient battle techniques - I can't help but wonder if true warriors actually make sure their toes are pointed properly, like an Olympic diver, when they fly at the enemy. Similarly, I wonder about the sense in going into battle in nothing but a jockstrap. OK, maybe they did. I don't know. However, if the real Spartans were anything like this crew, Sparta's problem wasn't conquest. It was repopulating. If you get my drift.",Null,3,4,29 October 2011
Cube," squared
","I wanted to like this. I thought this would be a feature length version of the 'Twilight Zone' greats dealing with paranoia and an unseen, trapping presence. Give me Kafka tension any day. But what destroys this are several inexcusable elements. The first is really, really bad acting, particularly that of the cop and the doctor. The second is writing that begins realistically, and then veers headlong into pseudo-meaningful rubbish. Most unforgivable,though, is the famous ending of nothingness. It is not interesting to leave your audience with not even a suggestion of an answer. It is lame. 'Cube' is plain adolescent, and its too bad.",3,4,7,25 February 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Go, Joss, Go
","I detract points from this only because Bradley Whitford's death is too quick, and comes too late (has there ever been a more smarmy, pompous type?). But, seriously - thanks to the Whedon wit, this is a really fine and surprising horror film. It is well-paced, well-directed, and well- acted. More importantly, the story holds up, as unreal as it is. The genius of the film, in fact, is how it presents exactly how realistically such an other-worldly scenario would play out, with arrogant humans at the controls and partying a wee bit too early. There is slasher gore, which I detest, but it's strangely just fine, as the sheer creativity of the array of beasts at the end overrides gore. A personal satisfaction: Sigourney Weaver getting axed by Zombie Patience. As much as I adore 'Alien', she is a crummy actress who has somehow been perceived as a good one, and choosing her for that dominatrix role was brilliant. It's been a long, long time since I feel like I can heartily recommend a horror movie. Thanks, Joss.",8,1,5,26 September 2012
The Birds," The Real 'Why'
","I've seen this movie many times and I think I finally got it (with apologies to any posts already saying this, that I have not read). Incidentally, it's a nearly perfect film, I'm not a Hitchcock fanatic by any means, and the only real flaw is the sequence of three stills of Melanie in the diner window. Never mind. It's Mom behind the 'bird war'. It's Jessica Tandy. We know of only one attack prior to Melanie's arrival - the gulls and the fishing boat - and it may be that was a little bit of Lydia Brenner premonition. Just watch all the scenes in the Brenner house; every time Cathy expresses affection for Melanie, Tandy is stressed. Same with Mitch. Then come the birds. Most telling is the climactic attack later on, when they're all sitting and waiting in the boarded home. Cathy feels sick and turns to Melanie, not her mother. Two minutes later...Then, before the schoolhouse attack, Lydia asks Melanie three times if Cathy will be safe there. She knows, somehow. And don't forget that, the birds aside, the pivotal tension in the storyline is Lydia's neurotic dread of being abandoned.What is very cool is that Lydia is unaware of what she is creating through her distress.",10,2,4,13 July 2009
Up in the Air," Flying WAY Over Cohesion and Continuity
","What this has going for it: a solid performance by the girl who plays Natalie, a few droll lines, and a twist. But this twist is actually the worst thing about this film. It's worse than the 'Requiem for a Dream' quick-cut repetitive sequences. It's worse than Clooney's relentless crinkly-eyed smile, which I could not take any more, ever, after twenty minutes. It's worse than the cliché parades of fired people and their contrasting reactions, and it's worse than the blatant, blatant, blatant metaphors of travel/solitude/loneliness/baggage. What is it? The twist is when Clooney's character runs from his isolationist preaching gig to find his lady love, only to knock at her door and discover her married and with kids. And this 'twist' took me by surprise simply because the screenplay had made it unthinkable. Had Clooney remained devoted to flying around and the woman an occasional liaison, fine. But LONG BEFORE his dream is shattered by her, he reveals himself changing. He takes her to his old school. He takes her to his sister's wedding. He opens up very, very much. So - her speech to him afterward about his being just a 'good time guy', as well as her anger and confusion, are utterly ridiculous. This made me really angry, that poor writing gets to jump chasms over continuity. All in all, this is Hollywood-as-meaningful tripe. You're better off with the Vampire garbage.",2,28,43,20 August 2010
