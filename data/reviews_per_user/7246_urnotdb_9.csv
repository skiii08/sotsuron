Minority Report," Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Future
","Very good acting (esp Morton), outrageously complicated but internally consistent (I think) story, subtle but brilliant special effects, user-friendly direction. Spielberg is one of the few 'big' directors from the 'Golden Age' of the 70s who is still improving (the only one?). Maybe because, since he owns the studio, I assume he has absolute control. It seems pretty clear that commercial success is not good for many artists. Maybe that's why Welles' creativity didn't diminish. Maybe it's not success but getting old. But even Welles and Spielberg got old. Some of Spielberg's stamina may be attributable to technical advances, since special effects have played such a big part in filling his film art gallery.",8,0,0,27 April 2005
The Hustler," Sympathy for the Devil: What a Character
","In this and Rossen's 'All the King's Men,' professional success was depicted as a dubious benefit of a devil's bargain, with many unintended consequences. 'The Hustler' may have also been intended as a depiction of labor/management relations, so 'character' may be synonymous with swallowing your pride and submitting to 'the man.' Of course, at the time this was made, some still thought Communism was a viable alternative. For those of us who aren't political scientists, these films also offer great stories (from great novels), scripts, acting, and direction. You may have to go along to get along, or you can try to go your own way. It doesn't pay as well, but there may be fewer costs.",9,4,6,20 September 2005
Hotel Rwanda," Rising from the Ashes
","Thinking this would be essentially a documentary, I was reluctant to go; it seemed inappropriate to sit comfortably in a cineplex watching the re-enactment of an outrage. But I did go and it turned out to be a compelling political thriller, on a par with famous ones like 'The Quiet American' or 'The Comedians.' The twisting story helped elucidate the political complexity. To the extent that the story is true, it showed the remarkable courage and ingenuity of Paul, his wife, and a UN peace-keeper, all operating under unimaginable pressure. A compassionate corporate CEO provided critical support. We see how these societies are controlled by corrupt officials until power struggles erupt among the corrupt. Ironically, Paul was only successful because he knew how to play the bribery game. As has been pointed out Cheadle and Okonedo, and most of the cast, were perfect. One can expect that people capable of escape from scourges like this could be destined for additional acts of greatness in the future.",Null,2,3,6 April 2005
The Bourne Identity," Who are Those Guys?
","I realized I liked this when I was willing to watch it on commercial TV (and I had already seen it in the theater!). Interesting, exciting thriller with international setting; the Damon/Potente pairing made it special, like Redford/Dunaway in 3 Days of the Condor (a similar story). The action scenes are just a little different from the usual. How did they get so many good actors for a relatively routine story? Free trip to Europe? Like Redford, Damon isn't usually labeled a 'great' actor, although both have consistently been convincing in entertaining movies. I'm glad they made this movie; the book is too long. Maybe that's why so many books are so long; encourage people to see the inevitable movie instead.",7,0,1,21 April 2005
The Color of Money," Redemption Songs
","In 'The Hustler' talent didn't guarantee big money since 'the house' not only took a cut but also decided who played and on what terms. Eddie walked away from 'the business,' the best in the world, with little to show for it, because he didn't want to become, like Fats, a robot who could drink but not get drunk, skip sleep and not feel tired. In this sequel he is depicted as having learned to hustle money on his own terms, within the rules, but without playing pool. He hopes to get back into it vicariously, as a 'manager', but realizes what he really needs is to play. But he has to face the harshest reality: getting old. Now, matched against the best young players, he really is 'a loser.' But this time, he has money. This was maybe even more interesting than 'Rounders' and 'The Gambler,' other good movies about unorthodox ways of 'finding yourself.'",9,1,2,26 March 2006
Mulholland Drive," All the World's a Screen Test
","Assuming 'intelligent design' was intended here, Mulholland Dr. may be a Shakespearean tragedy about role-playing. The shifting identities may represent a dream, other parallel universes, or just stereotypes. Like The Matrix, the 'plot' involves events occurring in various loosely connected 'universes.' For me, this 'sound and fury' would have amounted to little more than 'a tale told by an idiot' except for the casting of Naomi Watts, whose brilliance makes it worthwhile, although still to a limited (probably younger) audience. So, consistent with the apparent theme, it's not what you know, it's who you know. (To be fair, Faulkner's Sound and Fury is also unintelligible to most).",6,1,2,14 March 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Inward bound: It's a Mystery to Me
","In mysteries like Eternal Sunshine, The Matrix, Mulholland Dr., the mystery isn't only who-really-dunit, but also who's real; the mystery isn't the 'story' but how the story was portrayed (is all or part a dream, a vision, a memory, a program). Some of these stories move dangerously close to the childish 'it was all a dream' resolution. Eternal Sunshine doesn't do that, but we have to deal with (I think): what he's really seeing, what he's imagining, what he's forgetting, what he's thinking while forgetting, what's happening to him while he's forgetting, what's happening to others, what happens after the forgetting. And it's not obvious which is which, or when. Maybe the point is that thinking something can make it so. I guess anything is OK, as long as it's entertaining.",6,0,1,17 April 2005
Mystic River," Near the Waterfront
","Four good actors portray two couples trapped in a modern Shakespearean tragedy about 'justice' and cycles of violence. Eastwood undoubtedly saw the first run of 'On the Waterfront.' Some scenes here are reminiscent of the style of that classic. Good mystery plot heavy on coincidence as usual in this genre. But that helps dramatize the point that without the justice system, circumstantial (i.e. coincidental) evidence would often convict the innocent. The ending is a reasonable commentary on the evolution of a criminal gang leader. That he would get a pass from his wife or friend couldn't be uncommon. Much of the violence in the world is deemed 'justified.'",8,1,2,23 April 2005
Cinderella Man," One Way Ticket From Palookaville, and Dogville
","Braddock lost everything because of injuries and 1929. He didn't take it out on his family, or society or look for scapegoats. He got a second chance, culminating in a title shot in 1935, as a long shot (apparently 10-1). At about the same time, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote 'There are no second acts in American lives' (ironically, Fitzgerald was only considered 'great' posthumously). The film 'Dogville' proposed an America whose 'true' ugliness would be exposed by poverty. www.nydailynews.com has reprinted some of its 1935 articles about the fight, including one that depicted a different America: 'Braddock has been kicked around. He has been down and out on relief, and all but counted out in the game of life. He's an underdog of underdogs, a fellow who has taken his tough breaks without a squawk and has kept on punching - and Joe Public and his pals love this type of guy.'",7,0,0,21 June 2005
