Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode 1 in comparison to the trilogy.
","Fear not the reviews my friends. Let the force be your guide.This movie is truly worthy of the name STAR WARS.  Further more, I think it may even have gone beyond that of which the original trilogy has accomplished.I think a lot of people worried about the fact of famous actors being in the film, as well as the fact that this movie is being released in the year of 1999, an age in which most of us think that movies have lost their magic, and one of which is dominated by commercialism*.  However, George Lucas is not dead, and the outcome of my latest STAR WARS experience brings with it the conclusion that the legend lives on.The storyline is fantastic.  The costumes are exquisite and beautiful, especially Queen Amidala's array of costumes, including head dresses and make up.  I think there are no two scenes in which Amidala wears the same costume or headdress twice;  The attention to detail is truely breathtaking, and the special effects are top notch, but not over the top.I am a huge fan of Star Wars, and of fantasy in general. Not since Francis Ford Coppola's 'White Dwarf' have I seen a fantasy film this good.Go see the movie today! ..and may the force be with you :-)* This is not to say that Star Wars is not commercial, but I meant commercialism for the sake of making money, not as a result of a great film.",10,0,0,11 June 1999
