Black Swan," Dramatically Thrilling and Brilliant
","Black Swan is as much as an experience as the play that was interpreted within the film. From the very beginning, the lighting was one of the strongest I've seen from a film, it being a large supporter of the film's overall tone. In fact, each element of the movie seems be reincorporated to support the tone; as it's soundtrack drives the scenes, and it's use of dance is used in contrast of the very character's mental standing.The viewing of the mental standing of the main character, Nina, is shown in moderation. Giving and showing more and more throughout the film, within it's symbolism and character contrast. All until the final act of the movie, where all is revealed. This being a masterful display and character study of one's own madness. In only one instance, I do feel as if practicality was sparred for the sake of tone, but it didn't take away from the film's overall quality (the subway scene). In some instances, the movie is brilliant and thrilling by balancing emotional scenes in the surreal, while the directing and acting are constantly great throughout. Notably taking inspiration of the original play itself, the film has one of the greatest final acts I've ever seen. 9/10",9,0,2,5 January 2016
Suicide Squad," Garbage
","Sloppy scene structure doesn't make good movies. Unconventional characters alone don't make good movies. Bad directing, bad editing, bad CGI, bad acting. If a film fails on every aspect but still is by all means successful, what does that say about it's audience. Lets stop making terrible movies. One-liner, one-dimensional characters with no depth beyond the label of 'bad', 'evil', 'crazy' fill this movie, as a surprisingly congested script attempts to give them backstory. Although comedy is very subjective, jokes in addition to the majority of the dialogue in general is very cringe-worthy. I felt embarrassed whenever anyone spoke. It all make me want to commit suicide squad.",1,37,63,6 August 2016
