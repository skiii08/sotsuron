The King's Speech," Watch it for Colin Firth and Geoffery Rush
",The King's Speech: I dreaded that this movie would be really serious boring and predictable. But I was surprised to find that it had its comedic moments and little surprises thrown with the beautiful background and architecture of the British Empire. Colin Firth gives an Oscar winning performance .It was good to see Helena Bonham Carter playing a normal person and not one of the weirdos for a change who cares about her husband and has a quiet self-assurance that in the end he would come out triumphs. The life of the movie is actually Geoffrey Rush who is given the tough job of a guy who confidently steers stammers/people with speech problems to confident speakers and pulls it off with dignified grace given the surprising background lurking in his past sprung suddenly on the audience. It's so nice to know that there are people who go back to history and dig out stories of strength and vulnerabilities of historical or royal figures. Watching 4-5 movies a week feels like reading 5 books of entirely different topics and is a really fulfilling experience for me.,Null,0,0,9 March 2011
The Way Back," an impossible journey to survive
","The Way Back: A story about a bunch of people falsely declared traitors by Stalin's regime taken as prisoners. Some of them decide to runaway and break free. There is a dialogue by Ed Harris to Jim Sturgess(Neil Nitin Mukesh's doppelganger) that he is ready to run from the prison because he can take advantage of one of his weakness and that is kindness. And Jim asks how. and he says that if at any point he falls he knows Jim won't leave him behind and he never does throughout the movie. This group was really a bunch of really decent people ,an artiste , a forgiving husband, a heartbroken father , a comedienne by nature and finally the young toughie-vulnerable-survivor girl who comes later and wins everyone over. The Journey itself is soo sooo tough that I can't believe that someone wouldn't just give up and rather die but that is the strength of our survival instincts. These people born in Russia dealing with the snowstorms dressed in layers of clothing travel through mountains & Lakes, sun stroked- sand stormed -mirage filled deserts in those snow boots with feet swollen to elephantic proportions and skin burned to red-flesh eating anything they could lay hands on and sucking water from drenched piece of clothing staring death in the face. That kind of determination is not only tough to portray but I am sure must have been tough to shoot as well. When the girl dies it really is one of the most horrible deaths I have seen on screen. Finally only 4 of them make it through and reach India where they are welcomed with open arms and hearts..no passports no papers notwithstanding. Thank God for a positive end to this real life story. The end where finally Jim goes back to Polanf to his wife when U.S.S.R was dissolved and meets his wife was icing on top of everything. Again a great triumphant story from history so kudos to the person who went back digging to bring it out on screen. Very fulfilling experience again.",Null,1,5,6 March 2011
The Artist," The Artist transition from Silent to Talkies.
","The Artist: I hear of people who see Charlie Chaplin movies and Laurel Hardy movies but i don't recollect watching full movies of them , a little glimpse here and there when i was a kid. The artist is really an exemplary experiment. A charming dashing silent hero whose smile warms the cockles of ones heart is slowly rendered obsolete by the talking movies. Who knew so much can be conveyed with not ...one word being said.The charm of silent movies where a live orchestra was played while the film rolled and theaters had these charming glamorous round balconies with people dressed to the nines is brought out really well. Will the pride of the dwindling star send him to oblivion or will he reinvent himself and change with the times with the helping hand of a guardian angel Peppy Miller the new star of talking movies. Watch to find out. I thought that 'The Artist' was an original thought but it seems to by super-heavily inspired from the movie 'Singin' in the Rain' a 1952 musical.It has the cheerfull-ness of the 1920's in Gene Kelly's smile and easy nature and in the high pitch of the actress's voice. SITR also talks about the transformation of movies from silent to talkies but in comparison unlike Jean Dujardin in Artist which is self destructive and gloomy, the transition for the actor Gene Kelly is much at ease probably due to his constant companion Cosmos who provides comedy and support to Gene's character and the actress Kathy his love interest. In 'the artist' tap dancing is shown to come to their rescue at the end of the movie. In 'singin in the rain ' it is a part of the narrative in the middle of the movie which helps them transition from silent to talkies.It's an enjoyable watch.",7,0,2,5 March 2012
The Fighter," The Fighter
","The Fighter: It's a true story about the early years of boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him and Christian Bale physically transforms himself to resemble the real guy to the T.An Oscar very well deserved. Apart from the interesting boxing matches ( I don't enjoy the sport) it also talks a lot about relationships and how mothers build a world around themselves not ready to believe the truth about their children, about people on addiction not able to grasp the mess their lives are in and the gravity of the situation, A person(Mark Walberg) who is capable of achieving much more but is limited due to family obligations or what his family thinks is best for him , a family who wants to do good by one son while still living in an unreal world of hope for another and thus also unknowingly pulling down Mark. Also Amy Adams plays a Girl friend who is not miss goody two shoes and gives it back as good as she gets it, says sorry when she is wrong and accepts that she might have not achieved much in life herself but wants what is best for her BF Mark.Melissa Leo who plays the mom gives great facial expressions of disappointments and when she is happy for her sons and sorry for her behavior and scared when mark gets thrashed in the boxing ring. With 2 Oscar wins you gotta watch this one for sure.",Null,0,0,8 March 2011
