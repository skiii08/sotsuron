Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as Good As Part 1
","I was so let down. Part 1 was pretty good, and I thought that this would follow suit. Too bad it drags on, and on, and on....So much that you begin to get bored with the scenes.Tarantino tries way to hard to make this an epic movie, but if it falls flat on its face. There is way too much discourse. The dialogue has none of the magic from his earlier works. All of the characters begin to sound like people who are trying to prove how smart they can sound.Plus, he again tries to resurrect an actor's career (see Travolta, Grier) but Daryl Hannah who is just brutal.Honestly, Vols 1 & 2 could have been compressed into one film.",1,7,14,25 July 2005
Closer," Worst Movie of the Year.
","After hearing some good reviews of this film, my wife and I picked it up at the video store. What we found is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen.First off, the film drags on. This is a trap that many filmmakers fall into when they make a picture that relies on discourse.In addition, the dialogue in the film was very raunchy. Some of the lines seam to have been lifted out of Penthouse. I'm sure that the 'this is Art, not Profanity' battle cry will be sounded. But please.All of the characters were so appalling, that I found my self hoping that some sort of disaster killed them all. In addition they were all flat. None of the character evolve. None of them learn from there mistakes. They just keep on making them.Portman is horrible. She was like watching a high school drama club production of Our Town. I think that Julia Roberts probably owed some one a favor.",1,3,5,29 November 2005
Spider-Man," Highly Recommended
","This movie was much better than I expected.  True to the original story of Spider Man.  Dafoe is excellent.  There are parts where it may be a little cheesy, but remember, this is a movie based on a comic book.
Better than any of the Batman movies.  And in my opinion, better than X-men.",8,0,0,2 May 2002
28 Days Later...," It's okay
","It is okay.  Zombie's (but they are not really dead) take over England/the world.  (How did they get off the Island? Anyway it is a decent movie with some suspenseful parts.  However it is a combination of the Stand, Lord of the Flies & Dawn/Day of the Dead.  If you have seen these movies (or read the books), you pretty much know what is going to happen.  There are several scenes that are taken directly from these sources.Not that I have a really problem with that, it just felt like I have seen this movie before.If you have not seen it, wait until it's on HBO.",8,0,1,22 March 2004
I Am Legend," Not Happy.
","I was not happy with the movie. The first half was good. You could see almost see that it was trying to be faithful to the book and the first two films.There were hints of the infected showing intelligence, and could have been starting a new society. The one infected is ticked off his girlfriend was kidnapped, he set a trap for Nevill and had guard dogs attack Nevill.But then it was like a Hollywood decided to do a rewrite of the second half. It was turned into another end of the world Alliens/28 days later/Dawn of the Dead movie.The Eathan character made no sense. Why was this kid in the film? There was also no twist ending. That is the whole point of the title.Smith is good, but he always is.If you are looking for a action movie. Its okay. If you are looking for a true adaptation to I Am Legend, go rent Last Man On Earth 1961",2,19,38,19 December 2007
