Walk the Line," Definitely a Must See
","What do you think of when you hear the name Johnny Cash? Well, I think I speak for just about everyone when I say, Isn't he the Man in Black?? Doesn't he sing: I Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, and the Nine Inch Nails cover; Hurt? Ya, before this movie, I did not know too much about this rebellious country singer. I knew he had a certain dark style of his own, and over the years I have learned to appreciate his music more and more. This particular day I wanted to hear some of those old rockin country songs and hear more of the story behind Mr. Johnny Cash. I was not prepared for what I was about to see... Although I knew Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were great actors, I did not know the depth and the range they were capable of. I was blown away by their ability to empty their hearts and souls in front of the camera. Not only did they help to tell the story for us, their work went above and beyond what is normally considered the responsibility of an actor or actress. They transcended any work I have seen on the big screen in a very long time. I can say this because most movies are just not moving anymore, it is pretty rare. But seriously, I was so moved physically and emotionally while watching this movie, I found myself crying, getting chills, and my soul being tugged from deep within. I was enwrapped with these characters from the beginning of this flick all the way to the end. Even the young Johnny Cash and his brother were impressive- to say the least. I was not aware until the end credits that Reese Witherspoon and Phoenix did all the vocals for the songs in this movie. I thought Cash's voice was in there somewhere... nope! We are also given a super performance by Ginnifer Goodwin who plays Vivian Cash (Johnny's first wife). The tension is felt as both women become entangled in Cash's drugged and drunken episodes. You can see the twisting and turning inside of Joaquin Phoenix, and as you look at his eyes and how the color of his skin changes you are convinced that he truly DID live the agony of Johnny Cash. The director James Mangold does a stellar job bringing together all the pieces necessary for an award winning movie, and this one WILL go down as one of the great ones. I think people will try to figure out exactly just how this display of raw emotion was translated into the frames of this film. This one will win awards and praises (and they will deserve each and every one of them)...You'll see. Definitely a MUST SEE Film!!~ Sir Ryan",8,0,2,27 November 2005
