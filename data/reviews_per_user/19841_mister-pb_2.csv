Blade Runner 2049," A journey into a visually stunning future with a beautifully created atmosphere
","I'm writing this review since I believe this movie deserves a higher number! This movie is like a delicate recipe: get one component wrong and you ruin the dish. But this was not that, they executed it perfectly!visually a 10; acting a 10; soundtrack a 10 (Hans Zimmer duh!); story a 10 since they followed up to first movie and kept it mysterious.Many people expected a high action sci-fi, but this is not that: it is an experience! So, if you want to leave this world and enter a possible future which is mysteriously stunning, then this is your movie! Enter and experience sci-fi in its rawest form.",10,3,12,24 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disney destroyed StarWars
","Lore? Characters? Saber-fights? Nah, we don't need that.
We need more women, more emotions, more useless conversations and we need to kill off the old characters ASAP. BTW: don't forget the plot holes and depict the First Order as an white patriarchy.Never paying for StarWars movies again. You guys should LISTEN to Mark Hamill for heavens sake...",3,2,3,28 December 2017
