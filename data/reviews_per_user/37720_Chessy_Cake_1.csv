Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The good is back..
","After the sequel duds, I can safely say Pirates of the Caribbean is back to its fun roots with On Stranger Tides. I have to admit, I am not a PoTC geek. In fact, I have only managed to see the first one completely; the second and third one were too long, too boring, and too confusing to be worth my time.Stranger Tides boasts of a tight script, stellar visuals, fantastic adventure and, of course, great performance from the entire cast, especially Captain Sparrow, Johnny Depp. The movie does get a bit stretched, consequently drowning the tempo before relieving it with another fun sequence. I would say a trim of about 15-20mins would had made the movie even better.Overall, Stranger Tides is an excellent movie. Even if you have not followed the previous story lines, and as long as you are aware of the characters, you will have no trouble following the story in this one.",8,10,16,17 May 2011
