Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too childish
","No one can argue that the special effects in this movie are outstanding. The plot, however, is arguable.  Written for a ten to fifteen year-old crowd, lots of 'cute' things were written into it that only take away from the original trilogy.  It is only fair to tell you that I loved Star Wars and the Empire Strikes back, while I thought Return of the Jedi was only good, because of the 'cute' Ewoks.  Little Ewoks could not take down some of the mammoth Empires war machines with ropes, but I digress.If you have a teenager, take them to see the movie.  If you are like me and the EWOKS were too cute, this movie will be too cute as well.  One great use of this movie is to test out a home theatre system.",5,0,1,18 July 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," I Must Disagree
","Dorian said on February 14, 2002 that 'Some people have bashed this film because of the plot's impossibilities, and the impossibility of people flying, and jumping as high and as graceful as the characters in this film can. GROW UP!!! Yeah, that's right - GROW. UP. For the two simple reasons1) It's a bloody film!! 2) Ever heard of the expression 'suspension of disbelief'?!' ------------------------------------I expected a better argument from an English person.  #1 - you want us to like the film because it's a film.  That isn't a very persuasive argument.#2 - you expect us to 'suspend our disbelief' without a reason.  Walking into a movie theater is not enough to suspend disbelief.  If I'm watching an animated Disney cartoon, I can suspend my belief when a mouse talks.  The movie Babe was about animals talking to each other - fine I can accept that and move on.  Star Wars starts off the whole movie by saying 'In a galaxy far, far away..' Great, laser swords and Jedi Knights exist their.  In all of these areas I can easily suspend disbelief.But I can't suspend disbelief when watching Arnold Schwarzenneger in Commando, somehow dodging 50 submachine guns firing on him from forty feet away.  Why you ask?  Because the movie based itself in reality, the other movies clearly tell you up front that this is fantasy.  Crouching Tiger tried to be a martial arts/romance movie and as a serious movie never explained how people fly through the air.  This movie would have been better if they started it off with some old monks reading some ancient book that explained how the great ancestors could tap into some hidden powers.Why didn't they do that?  Because then it becomes a fantasy movie which stuffy critics choose to hate.  Critics like yourself who probably have never seen Conan the Barbarian or Lord of the Rings.  Mark my words, here in writing, Lord of the Rings does NOT win best picture, even though 37,000+ people have given it the highest rating of any movie ever made in the history of mankind.  Oh, and by the way, Lord of the Rings takes place in an ancient pre-civilization world where elves and hobbits exist.  So I had no problem suspending disbelief when I saw the hairy footed 4 foot tall creatures.",1,7,18,15 February 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Not as good as I hoped
","I grew up on B grade Chinese kung-fu movies and looked forward to one that actually got great reviews.The photography is stunning.  The fight scenes were beautiful.  The acting was great. The movie SUCKED!  Sorry to be so mundane, but I couldn't like this movie.  As a previous person stated a movie must 'Suspend Disbelief' and Crouching Tiger never explained how these people could literally fly. And as many people have mentioned, in the Matrix they explain it.The first time I saw someone flying around I was in shock and I waited for a reason.  They never explain it.  Then the movie turns into a poor love story.  Then, the worst part of the movie, was when the witch lady (I don't remember her name) kills your hero.  WAIT A MINUTE!  In a previous scene our hero tells the governors daughter that this witch lady could not have taught her everything because she just isn't that good.  Yet she kills him!  That's like me walking into the ring with Mike Tyson and kicking his butt.Save yourself some time and skip this movie.  The only people who I've met that like this movie never saw a Bruce Lee movie before.  Go rent 'Enter the Dragon' and have a much more enjoyable time.",1,0,2,15 January 2002
