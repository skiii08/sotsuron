Child 44," Lose Yourself
","Excellent opportunity to lose yourself in a brilliantly multifaceted, deftly crafted story about love, war, politics, serial-killers, violence, loyalty, betrayal, tenderness, and back again. And again. New every time. Fresh, like running water, the story keeps you guessing throughout, and yet at the same time it feels oddly familiar, a bit like seeing your own reflection in the mirror for the very first time. Acting? Seamless. The entire cast, not just the ever so captivating leads. Not one false note amongst the lot. I vote Child 44 should receive the much coveted Collective Oscar Award 2016. Direction? What direction? Surely, the story just went and told its spellbinding self. By itself. Daniel who? And as for the cinematography, the look and feel of this film was authentic and distinctive enough for me to actually look up the DP's name: Oliver Wood. Who's probably just another genius on board of Child 44. Could go on, but think this more than covers the IMDb's suspiciously lofty demand for a mini-essay. Hope you enjoy watching Child 44 as much as I did.",10,159,246,12 May 2015
Green Room," One star goes to the dog, the other to Patrick Stewart...
","... not for his acting, mind you, but for the 'this is a movement, not a party' line he spits out almost against his own dollar-shaped will. I had pretty high expectations of this movie, 7.3 on IMDb (yeah, I still fall for that), and the whole premise of a potentially highly entertaining shenanigans between a punk band and a bunch white supremacists, hurrah. But oh mien Gott, what a sorry mess this film turned out to be. The acting for starters, deader than Jesus on the cross, except the bearded guy managed to resurrect himself off in the end... the Green Room actors? Not so much. It appeared they only ever delivered their lines when prompted into action by a way offside prompter (fluffer?), or maybe the filming coincided with the Union strike, so they had to act as if under duress...In which case, the Oscar goes to......... er, it's got to be the dog again. As for the dialogue, well let's say there was 2000 lines in the script (I don't know this, I'm just making up the numbers here okay), then imagine that each of those lines was written by 2000 different people from 2000 different places in the world, no connection whatsoever. Yet somehow they get the story to move in a semblance of a direction. Which, as every quantum physicist knows, is totally possible, maybe even inevitable, but still incapable of delivering a story, let alone a good one. Like, wtf, doh, yeah, double wtf, the end. Nice photography though, cool filters dude.",2,10,25,11 July 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Parody of Errors
","Tom Hardy as Mad Max, in for a treat I thought. Charlize Theron, well if anyone can match Tom Hardy playing Mad Max - I thought - then Charlize can. As for the storyline, with such a legacy, and a bit of dosh, how can you go wrong (I thought). Opening scene, Tom Max munches up a two-headed lizard, alive. Hehe, funnnneeeyyy, good start I thought. After that, the whole thing goes tits up. You hardly notice it at first, because you're just sitting there, sucking on your smuggled popcorn, waiting to see some serious action wrapped up in great acting wrapped up in a riveting narrative. And there certainly is plenty of action in Mad Max: Fury Zzzz, but it's of the wrong, grossly overdone, silly kind. The acting is stilted, like everyone's been dubbed over, in body as well as voice. The storyline's cheap and nasty, with a dialogue to match. Good points? Music score, definitely. Can't think of anything else.Have considered giving it 1 star, as a punishment for wasting such huge resources - and 2 hours of my vida - on this surreal parody of errors wannabe, but settled on 5 because of the soft spot I have for Hardy, on account of just having watched-loved him in Child 44, and because Theron's buffness has fresh inspired me to drop yoga and take on some army training.In other words: move along, folks, nothing to see here.",5,8,20,18 May 2015
