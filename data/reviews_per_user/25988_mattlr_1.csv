Blade Runner 2049," Wow!
","Wow this movie is simply amazing, and surpasses the original something I did not think would be possible. Some general comments about the movieLength: I almost did not even go see this moving because of its 3 hour length with trailers. However, I could have watched another hour of this movie. Even the slow scenes are simply breathtaking to watch. If you are concerned about the length, do not worry, it will not disappoint.How I felt after the movie: What made blade runner so impressive is how it made you really feel for the main character, even though he does not talk much. It also made you really think about what is humanity and what defines if something or someone is real. The movie does this without being in your face about it. A good science fiction should make you think after its over.Ignore all the 1 star reviews, this is an amazing movie.",10,1,7,10 October 2017
