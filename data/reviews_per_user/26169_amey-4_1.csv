Angels & Demons," Absolutely Pathetic
","I went to this movie with great expectation from earlier film Da Vinci Code, Ron Howard and Tom Hanks...but Surely disappointed in first 10 min itself to sit through 2 hrs. On top of this I forced two of my friends into this with me. Book is so exciting and full of thrill that you don't want to leave it until you finish, first 20-30 pages will set the tempo so that u don't want to leave the book, but, movie on other hand is totally boring and slow. There are so many things missing...... Movie is worst, slow, dragging. Book is thrilling and far more enjoyable than this movie. Ron Howard did a very poor job, shouldn't have made this movie at all and wasted his and my time, first with watching movie and secondly forcing me to write this, so that others should not suffer from what I am suffering now.",1,6,20,25 May 2009
