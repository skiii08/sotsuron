The Hangover," A really funny movie
","I can not remind myself that I've laughed this much for a long time. Everything from start to finish offers a wonderful blend of humor, so I think everyone will find something they like in this movie. It's hard not to find a favorite character because all the characters have so many things to offer.After seeing this movie for the third time, I think it has exactly the same charm as the first time. I will probably look at it many more times in the future and that says a lot about the movie. I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it and if it's been a long time since you saw it, watch it again! It's worth it.",8,3,4,11 January 2012
Midnight in Paris," A magical adventure which I think most people will appreciate.
",Midnight in Paris is a very imaginative and entertaining film about that you should appreciate what you have in the present. The film is very nicely filmed and it shows much of the city's beautiful surroundings. It's a really fun film filled with wonderful music and the actors were really good. During the film there was a lot of funny situations that Gil (Owen Wilson) ended up in and I could identify myself with the character many times throughout the movie. Although I thought the movie was predictable I didn't think it was any less boring. I recommend the movie to anyone who just wants to watch a nice and fun movie.,6,1,1,6 January 2012
