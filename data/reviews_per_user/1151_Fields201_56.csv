The Avengers," Avengers Assemble!
","So much build up and it all leads to this: And it's awesome! I know I'm late in reviewing this and everything has been said in all kinds of praise and this movie deserves it. Just see it. Even if you don't like comic book movies: See it. What I find amusing is that Ironman was never really the top billing of The Avengers. It was always Captain America... until now. Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene that his name is first on the credits. Seriously, he's that awesome. I was also surprised with Mark Ruffalo's performance as The Hulk. He was great! His scenes with Robert Downey Jr. are some of the most memorable. I also haven't seen the Thor flick but the guy who played them was really good and really seemed into character. Hawkeye was cool and Scarlett Johanssen is hot. Okay, the plot? Bad guy named Loki wants to take over the world and does a really good General Zod impression (Kneel before me!) and Avengers try to stop him. What's funny is that he looks tough in the beginning but then turns into a rag doll at the end. Just ask The Hulk. And whatever injustice the previous movies had done to The Hulk certainly makes up for it here.Just see it! It's a lot of fun and it's what summer movies are supposed to be. It's a great beginning to summer movies. I'm glad I went!",9,6,11,7 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," And Really Bad Eggs....
","Upon hearing the announcement for Pirates of the Caribbean, I had to ask myself: 'Is this a way to milk the franchise some more or was it to redeem themselves for the horrid At World's End?' After much pondering, I'm going to say both. Does the fourth one make up for their last abomination or has the cow's udder had finally fallen off?First and foremost, the Pirates is about fun and what imagination is brought to the screen. This time, the imagination is bent on finding the Fountain of Youth. It's apparent right from the very first frame, and we are constantly reminded about the Fountain Youth from Scene 1 to Scene End. It's said in every sentence of dialogue between characters. I have expected a narrator to say in every scene, 'And so our heroes search for the Fountain of Youth...' in case we the stupid audience has forgotten about what they were after. The film pits Captain Jack Sparrow pretty much forced to find the Fountain of Youth against his will by his ex-girlfriend Angelica and her father Captain Blackbeard (played by Ian McShane, and I enjoyed every scene he was in), and meanwhile, Captain Barbosa (once again played by Geoffrey Rush in his memorable performance) and his crew. I'm not really sure what their motivations are for finding the Fountain of Youth. Captain Jack just wants his Black Pearl back, and the rest, well, I guess they just want eternal youth. Along the way there is swashbuckling, mermaids who kill people, zombies, bad people, and banters between Captain Jack and Captain Blackbeard. I must say the actions sequences this time around are creative, and I would be lying if I said that they weren't thrilling. The first half of the film kinda dragged, but it picks up once they find the mermaids. However, it's like a trek through the jungle, and nobody really gets lost and they just happen to stumble onto the Fountain of Youth later on. As a friend of mine pointed out, that at least in At World's End, their journey seemed to be more deadly. They nearly froze to death and almost doomed. The stakes didn't seem to high on this one, other than being attacked by fish and Spaniards. Another problem I had with this one is the direction. For a summer blockbuster, the scenes just felt a little slow moving, and the establishing of each scene almost made me not care of what the scene was going to be. The writing was good, and I think that's what saved it. So why did I like this one? I just enjoy Johnny Depp's performance of Captain Jack Sparrow this time, and Rush's performance as Barbosa. I also really enjoyed Captain Blackbeard. The action scenes (though sometimes just come out of nowhere) kept me from falling asleep at the slow parts, and at least the film didn't feel like it was all over the place like its two predecessors. It has a clear focus, at least, and I liked how it doesn't stray far from that other than the needless romantic subplot between the clergyman and the mermaid.If you are a fan of the franchise, then you are going to see this anyway. I'm not sure if the film will make more fans or not, but it's enough excitement to warrant my butt in the multiplex in the next installment whenever that comes out, savvy.",7,1,2,20 May 2011
Men in Black 3," MFields Review: Men in Black 3
","This is definitely an improvement over the last installment. I think what's great about this particular one is seeing Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones back together and the inclusion of Josh Brolin playing Tommy Lee Jones. That pretty much made the movie for me.Okay, there are some things that bothered me about this movie, though. So the whole movie centers around time travel, right? Well how come when Tommy Lee Jones is ripped through time and everyone says he's been dead for forty years, wouldn't Will Smith be thinking the same thing? What makes him different from anyone else? Also, if Tommy Lee Jones' character was the one who recruited him, wouldn't Will Smith still just be a cop rather than being a part of MIB? Why is he working there if he never met K? It doesn't make sense! And how is it that very quickly people start believing in his time theory? It's like saying that someone went through time to steal my Rice Krispies because it magically disappeared right in front of me and the cop automatically believes me and tells me to go find a time machine.But hey, I enjoyed the Josh Brolin scenes, though.While I'm complaining, though, I have to admit that this is one annoying villain. I don't know, he just comes off as a bad guy that the main bad guy of the film would send to you when he doesn't feel like getting out of his chair. This Boris the Animal character just comes off as a mentally challenged bad guy.But the action scenes (albeit short) were good and I enjoyed the chemistry between Will and Josh. Oh yeah, and there's this Griffin character too that knows everything about life and he's pretty annoying too. I know I complained a lot but I did enjoy the film. I wouldn't call it the best of the summer or anything but I'm glad I saw it. Oh and I can't stand 3D so I didn't see it in that.",8,3,9,26 May 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Forced To See This
","I know I'm late in reviewing this and probably no one is reading this review, but I had a hot date for this one and I couldn't say no. She really wanted to see this, and she had a thrill in dragging me along despite me not wanting to see this at all. I was never going to see this or any Twilight movie for that matter. She loved this one. I did not.The problem, the biggest problem to me, is that it's very, very, very boring. NOTHING HAPPENS! Let's see, we see Jacob take off his shirt in the first two seconds of the movie and then Bella and Edward awkwardly have a wedding with fake smiles on their face. Then she has nightmares, possibly to show some form of entertainment throughout this boredom of a movie, and then there's the reception. That was the only scene I liked in the movie. At least it provided some humor. Then they go off to Rio... and nothing really happens. Yeah, they keep having sex and Bella just keeps wanting more. She calls her dad who is the only likable character, at least to me, in the whole series and then she finds out she's pregnant with some hell spawn, I guess. And vampires and werewolves get ticked off.Then the dumbest moment happens. The wolves talking to each other. I swear it looked like a Saturday morning cartoon because they were so faked CGI and their voices was so Saturday morning cartoonish that Twi- hards should be offended! Anyway, the movie just drags and drags and I caught myself falling asleep. I held my date's hand and practically made out with it just to keep from falling asleep. I made it through the film. Thank God for that.After the film, she really looked at me in hopes that I would love it like she did. I really couldn't lie to her and I hate telling her how much I couldn't stand the film. She explained the whole lore of the Twilight series and I still don't get it. I hate these movies. Unfortunately she is dragging me to part 2. At least I can spend more quality time with her.",2,137,174,3 December 2011
The Expendables 2," Expendables 2: Fun For the Whole Family
","When a member of your family who never goes out let alone go to the movies, you know you have some kind of hit on your hands. My sister and my mom and I all went out to see this exciting movie and it will mark as one of the rarest events of my life.First off, the movie starts with some really good action. It cuts everything else and gets right into it. The movie knows what you came for (seeing your favorite action heroes blow stuff up) and it delivers. Then we see them celebrate for a little bit, get to know them, but no too long as its time to get to the story. The movie moves quick too. It caters to those with ADD and wants to get to the next action scene quickly. There's also no romance subplot here. It hints at one, but smartly strays from it.The most pivotal scene of the film is when we are introduced to Jean Claude Van Dam as the villain. He plays one jerk of a villain which isn't a stretch for him since he's a jerk in real life too. He basically belittles Sly and his crew while holding a hostage. This scene set the stage for the rest of the film quite nicely and you really want to see that payback they are demanding.Sly, Bruce, Arnie, Norris, Statham, they are are all great. My only gripe about this movie is that Jet-Li is hardly in this movie. He leaves them at the beginning of the film and never comes back. I was really hoping for a dramatic return but was bummed out. But hey, my mom and my sister both enjoyed it and I think any action movie buff would. If you grew up in the eighties loving these guys, you should definitely check out Expendables 2!",9,5,13,18 August 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," My Book Report: Abraham Lincoln
","Abraham LincolnA book report by Fields201When Abraham Lincoln was a small boy, he had a black friend named Will who was beaten by his owner. Abe was too small to stop him so he got whipped himself which angered his father. His father stopped him but what he didn't know was that he was messing with vampires and they killed his mother and eventually his father died too. Honest Abe vowed vengeance against the vampire who killed his mother, and some vampire hunter named Henry taught Abe Batman-style the ways of killing a vampire. He then sends Abe Lincoln out to this town to kill vampires and is not allowed to fall for anyone or make friends.WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT VAMPIRES: Vampires are really good at being out in the day. They also aren't allowed to kill each other. If they attempt to kill each other, they are like magnets and repel backwards as if the forces of God won't allow them to kill.Soon Honest Abe becomes President and sports that weird beard that we all know. The Battle of Gettysburg was very hard because we were up against vampires and they know how to disappear and sneak attack us. Luckily, Honest Abe had a fork and he figured out how to kill vampires with steel. The end.F-Teacher's Note:Did you watch that stupid movie? That is not how the President lived his life. And for the record, even though Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is better than Twilight, it is plagued by a way-too-serious-of-a- tone-for-a-script for the title. Abraham Lincoln (though looks like a young Liam Neeson) is very uninteresting and almost sleep inducing, but luckily the action scenes keep you awake. Next time, read an actual book of Abraham Lincoln instead of a movie you will forget about in a year from now on!",6,1,5,24 June 2012
Rocketman," It's A Musical
","I was really hoping Rocketman was a biopic of Elton John much like how Bohemian Rhapsody was. It's nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody. It's a musical about him dealing with homosexuality. It felt like everything was given to him as he went along. And yes, it's a musical.I don't normally bash on musicals because I actually like them but this one wasn't advertised as one. I guess the performances were fine but I doubt I'll ever see the Elton John movie again.",3,1,1,22 September 2019
Captain Marvel," My Last Movie In America
","I leave for Spain in a couple days and as I prepare to live in a different country, it would be appropriate to see a Marvel movie before I go.Here I thought this movie would be painfully average but I actually really enjoyed Captain Marvel. I was prepared to fall asleep but halfway through the movie I realized I was being entertained. It's not the best Marvel movie, but far from the worst.The only downside to this movie is that I fear Avengers:Endgame will be Captain Marvel 2 with Avengers in the background. All and all, it was fun and glad this was my last movie in America.",7,0,2,9 March 2019
The Hunger Games," Running Man With Metaphors
","I'm a little late in seeing Hunger Games due to having somewhat of a life lately and not being able to catch up with the latest flicks. Hype got me in that seat and the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is pretty hot. I feared that this would be another Twilight but thankfully it's much better than that piece of garbage.Hunger Games follows a Running Man competition when two people from each district must hunt and kill each other for food for the districts. This is entertainment for the rich people, see, and us po' people must earn our way if we want to survive. Two things about this scenario strikes me: 1) This could happen because the Government and rich people are getting worse and 2) Someone during the development (possibly the author of the book) must have played too many online games because that's what this reminded me of. Not that I really invest much time in those but I'm just saying.Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job carrying this movie and the characters and plot devices keeps you from getting bored. However, there really wasn't much character development to get you fully invested to characters who contribute to important scenes. There's a scene where Jennifer Lawrence was crying over a character and I really didn't feel much emotion, mainly because this character she was crying for never had the time to develop. Another thing that bugs me and I hear it's in the book is the costumes. They were just so outlandish and weird for my tastes. I was never really big on future movies anyway so I digress. I love the sets, though.But Hunger Games was a really good movie and I'll catch the sequel earlier when it comes out. Hopefully I'm not busy then.",8,3,9,18 April 2012
Ted," FINALLY a GOOD Summer movie!
","If it wasn't for The Avengers, I would say that so far, this summer is full of duds. Thankfully, Ted came out and I have to say it was really good. Thank you, Jesus, I can honest say a movie was good after walking out of the theater! First and foremost, and this was already in the trailers, but I really like the setup to the story. It's narrated like some fairy tale and this unpopular kid gets a magical teddy bear for Christmas who can interact with him and everyone else. The true story, however, is when they grow up and how their lives are.When I first saw the trailers, I thought I was high watching it. After seeing the movie, they must have been high making it. In fact, Teddy and Marky Mark are getting high an awful lot in the movie! But their a few things along the way that surprised me. Like the chemistry between Marky Mark Mila Kunis. It was very good! Not only that, Mila acted her butt off in a movie about a Teddy bear. Don't believe me, there is this scene where she gets really mad at him outside Ted's place, and it was a very solid performance. I was actually convinced that she was irate with him! What's odd is that a movie about a talking Teddy bear actually worked on an emotional level. That's no small feat! And the fact that the Teddy Bear sounds just like Peter Griffin and it made me feel something is also amazing!If there are a few things to gripe about, I would have to say that the Marky Mark character is almost too much of an idiot throughout the movie. I also have a hard time understanding why someone as hot as Mila would even stay with some a weirdo too.The movie is pretty funny and it is very entertaining. It's not the funniest movie I've ever seen but it does get the job done. After seeing Black Dynamite for the first time last night, the bar was set a little too high for this film anyway. Highly recommended though.",8,1,7,29 June 2012
Deadpool 2," Untitled Deadpool Sequel
","If only Untitled Deadpool Sequel was the title. If only. I just got back from seeing Ryan Reynolds' return as Deadpool and I didn't expect much, but found it to supply a lot of laughs and more breakage of the fourth wall. I didn't catch much of the trailers so everything in this movie was new. I liked the first one, but I was never much of a fan like most other people. Deadpool's woman dies by some criminal and Deadpool kills him. I thought this was going to be a revenge story (might have explained the plot in the previews but I missed that) but instead he joins the X-Men and saves some kid with fire hands. Then we are introduced to Cable (Josh Brolin) who wants to kill this kid while Deadpool in the kid are stuck in the prison from Escape Plan. The action scenes are spectacular. Honestly, what's even better is the ending to this movie. Let me just say it is good to stick around to the end (nothing after the credits so don't bother) and you are in for a treat. I was taken by surprise by it and it was very clever. I love it.I am certainly positive they will make a third installment. If you are a fan of comic book movies or Deadpool is your thing, you should really see this. I'll be honest, I thought this was going to be an average sequel that doesn't live up to the first. I don't remember much of the first but this one might be better. Just remember, it's a family movie.",7,1,3,19 May 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Surprisingly Fun
","I haven't seen a movie for a while because Twilight: Breaking Dawn had sucked the life out of me. Since then, I missed out on what probably were some entertaining films but I was drained and needed a break. Now I'm back in seeing Adventures of Tintin and I was very much entertained.The story in a nutshell is that Tintin (which me and some other people thought that was the name of the dog but surprisingly it was the guy) happens to buy some ship from some dealer. Then for some reason, buying that ship meant he had some people who want to kill him. Interesting, because the dealer didn't seem like he had too many problems. Anyway, so the ship gets stolen and Tintin and his dog Snowy embark on some quest to retrieve the ship and some missing notes. It's all for this treasure, which, to my knowledge, doesn't go further than that. No one is trying to take over the world or anything, just some rich guy who looks suspiciously like Spielberg wanting to get richer.I really liked the look and atmosphere of the film. The color and the lighting that they use is fantastic. The animation is top notch, too. I could even go as far as saying this is the best CG animation I have ever seen. Sometimes I literally thought it was live action. The action scenes are thrilling and they are easily some of the best action scenes I've seen in a while. I also loved the dog, Snowy.A good film always has its shortcomings and I would have to say that the Haddock character who comes midway through the movie really bogs the film down, especially for the last half. He's annoying and just plain odd. The film had a really good tone going but some of his scenes make it feel like a totally different film than what it should be (like him belching into the fuel tank of a plane). Also, he has this weird back story which really doesn't make sense. I don't want to give anything away, but the payoff just didn't seem realistic to me. If you liked Indiana Jones, the Uncharted games, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Goonies, then this film puts them in a blender and spits them out. It really is a great adventure film. I'm looking forward to part 2!",9,0,1,30 December 2011
Horrible Bosses," Almost Like The Hangover Without The Hangover
","I only found out about Horrible Bosses just recently and decided to give it a watch this weekend. I needed a good laugh after the week I had. I must say that I laughed, but not hysterically or anything.The film centers around three guys: Nick, Dale and Kurt; who hate their bosses and wants them dead. This sounds like a premise for a psychological thriller but it's actually a comedy... an adolescent comedy but a comedy. One boss played by Kevin Spacey (the best part of the movie) is such a jerk, that he's more of a bully than a boss. He also suspects his young hot wife of cheating on him, and this could be part of why he's so angry all the time. The other boss, played by Jennifer Aniston, wants to seduce Dale who is trying to be faithful to his fiancé. Then there's Donald Sutherland.... who isn't a jerk but he dies and the company is left to his cokehead son (Colin Farrell) who just wants to sabotage the company for his own personal gain.Part of the comedy is how they try to kill their bosses which is all part of the comedy. It has a nice few twist and turns in the story, and honestly I wasn't sure how it would all end. Another great addition to the film is Jamie Foxx who acts as their murder consultant. He looked like he was having a lot of fun with the role, and it was fun to watch him.Horrible Bosses is a funny film, but I didn't think it was a hilarious film. It's enough to go see it, but I doubt it would reach The Hangover standards with people so don't expect a sequel. The best part of this movie is that they refrained from using Ken Jeong, who is getting typecast lately. Kevin Spacey is worth seeing this film alone. For that I recommend it.",7,1,2,10 July 2011
Life of Pi," Life of Pi is Fun
","Life of Pi is one of those films that you would think about leaving the theater and would stick with you for a long while. It has a lasting appeal, and a great ending that is not often seen in films these days as most film endings suck.It didn't start out strong though as we follow an older Pi telling his story to a journalist. He covers the younger years of his life, and if anyone has ever seen The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, you will know that his earlier years is fairly boring. We discover why his name is Pi, and its from a swimming pool. Okay. It isn't until he gets older where we finally see him on that boat and that big tidal wave hits, and the imagery is astounding. Pi is thrust into a lifeboat and this is really where our movie begins. Pi is trapped on a boat with animals: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a fierce tiger. In fact, most of the movie is spent with Pi surviving hunger and not being eaten by this tiger in the middle of the ocean. What a great concept! It's also narrated by Pi, and its fantastic!If there is one complaint that I think most people would agree on is the use of very heavy CG. You can almost say there is too much CG and what is some beautiful cinematography. The tiger especially as it looks very good, but at times you can tell it was CG. You would notice this on a scene on a beach where the tiger is walking. The movement seems a little off and it ruins some of the realism on what could have been a very emotional scene.I can't recommend Life of Pi enough though. There's so many things I could say about it and it is a fantastic journey that if I saw it as a kid, it would be one of those movies I look back on and love even just for nostalgia sake. I'm seeing it again with my mom. This is one journey I think everyone should experience!",9,5,10,23 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," This Trilogy Doesn't Deserve The Emperor
","So I saw the final chapter in the Disney Star Wars trilogy and I didn't think it was garbage. I thought Force Awakens was ok, Last Jedi was garbage, and I thought this one was the Revenge of the Sith. I was shocked.It's not perfect by any means. There was a few points of lame especially near the end and some moments where Disney dropped the ball. But I felt the good outweighs the bad.There's one moment in the film that harkens back to Empire Strikes Back that involved a character we all know and love with the same music from that film. It put a smile on my face. There was a few other emotional moments as well.Look, my standards were low and all I asked for is to entertain me and be better than The Last Jedi. It delivered. I'm thankful we get to see these characters one last time. Oh, and Billy Dee Williams still got it as Lando.As far as The Emperor is concerned.... well I don't care how he's back, I'm just glad he's back.",8,4,17,19 December 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," America Still Needs Your Help!
","I must admit, I started liking Captain America after the arcade back in 1992 entitled 'Captain America and The Avengers.' Then after that, I got a copy of that horrid straight to video port simply titled 'Captain America'. I could tell the movie was trying, and it had potential, but it really fell apart as the movie dragged on. But flash forward to present day and Hollywood revives Captain America again with 'First Avenger: Captain America'. I can say one thing, it was better than that straight to video version.The film opens when a crew in the middle of a snowy field. They find what appears to be a ship or a vessel and they go inside. It looks very alien-like, and I was expecting something to attack them but instead they find Captain America's shield frozen in ice. Then we are quickly introduced to our main villain, Red Skull (played by the awesome Hugo Weaving)and he finds some blue cube thing that's called hydra or something. Then he kill someone to prove he's a bad guy.Then we are introduced to Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and he's the little guy trying to join the Army. He gets bullied, but a doctor who looks suspiciously like the doctor from Pan's Labyrinth takes an interest in him and puts him through an experiment to make him a super soldier. That's when he becomes Captain America. After he avenges the doctor's death from some random goon, his superior officer (Tommy Lee Jones) puts him through some gigs across the nation, even some films, until he learns his true potential thanks to his love interest, Peggy (the smoking hot Hayley Atwell). Then Captain America fights the war against Red Skull.I must say that build up to Captain America is great. In fact, this film was a joy to watch. My only problems with the film centers around the main villain. He was way too uninteresting. Even the final fight at the end was weak. The writing of this villain was a major setback to me as everyone else on the film carried it quite well. Hugo Weaving is an awesome actor and he did the best he could with the material he got. It's just a shame that his character was written rather flat and dull.It's not to say that the film was boring, as I mentioned it was a joy to watch. I still think X-Men: Origins was probably the best comic book movie of the summer with Captain America being second. A friend of mine once denied that there ever was a Captain America movie. Now I think he can finally admit that there is one now.",Null,7,17,22 July 2011
Bohemian Rhapsody," My Family and I Loved This Movie And That's Very Rare
","The only one missing in my family to see this was the true Queen fan but she had to work. Instead my other sister, nephew and my mom went to go see this and for the first time in what I think is ever we are unanimously loved this movie. I thought it was outstanding.The film starts out with Rami Malek (brilliant performance) as Freddie Mercury going from his mansion to the Live Aid concert until we go back to see just how the band got there. This was what I had been wanting to see from the film and how closely it recreates it because it was an amazing event and I never seen so many people until I saw that video.There is not a dull moment in this film. I can't say it accurately portrays the band, but I remembered a lot of stuff like Freddie playing the piano from his bed, the fact that he was gay. and that the band didn't always get along. The climax of the film, by the way, doesn't disappoint and it's amazing how accurate it was with the real event.Before I close this review, I must talk about the performances. Everyone did a wonderful job in the film but I think everyone will remember Rami Malek's portrayal as Freddie Mercury the most. I swear every single time he was on screen it was like seeing Freddie Mercury come to life. The way he is on stage is exactly how Freddie Mercury was. I'm not sure if he was really singing or not, but either way, he deserves to be nominated and I would lose faith in the Academy completely if he isn't.Queen fan or not, everyone should check out this movie. It is very inspirational, and a good representation of what it's like in the business. Mike Myers also does a cameo (an obvious thank you note for having his film Wayne's World putting them back on the map) and I didn't even recognize him until later in the film. I really need to see this film again now.",10,5,6,12 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter and the Series That Just Shouldn't End
","Seriously, I'm glad that the second part to this is a few months away because I'd hate to see this series end. As the film reflects back to previous events in the earlier installments, I myself reflected back at where I was in my life during each movie. The very first installment, I was practically fresh out of high school. And now here I am, witnessing the first part of the final installment. I've come a long way.Those who have read the book would know that Deathly Hallows follows it quite well. There are subtle differences, but none that would distract from the overall enjoyment of the film. Therefore, if you are one of those people who were disappointed at how butchered the previous movies were to the books, then you shouldn't have a problem with this one. To those who don't know, this film is about Harry, Ron, and Hermoine setting out to find the horcruxes that must be destroyed in order to defeat Voldemort. They don't really know where the horcruxes are, or how to destroy them. Meanwhile, Voldemort's minions are searching for them and the people that they care about are in mortal danger.The reason why I consider this one being the best one so far (although I really loved the first Harry Potter) is its brisk pace. In previous installments, there always seem to be this lag time. These lag times usually entail something being introduced to the characters that is vital to later in the film. This resulted in slowing the films' pace. It didn't really happen here. There were some slow parts, but something would pick up the speed and usually kept the audience laughing. There's a scene where Harry and Hermoine were distraught, and Harry danced with her like an idiot. It helped lighten the mood and also brought interest to the scene.There's a lot of action in this one, and the performances were unbelievable. I heard a lot of praise for Helena Bonham Carter as Belatrix. She did a wonderful job and a lot creepier this time around. The three leads: Harry, Ron and Hermoine all did a superb acting job this time around because their chemistry was on the mark. Also, there's an animation sequence in the film, which, at first, I thought was out of place because never had there been an animation sequence in a Harry Potter film before. It was awesome. I also welcome back Doby. What took him so long to come back?The only negative thing I could say about it and it's very minor is how the film ended. It just left you wanting more. But it is the first part and we would just have to wait on what will happen in the conclusion on the second part.J.K. Rowling is probably writing a new Harry Potter as we speak.",10,1,3,19 November 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," It's Amazing!
","When I first heard that Spiderman was being rebooted, I was like, 'Why?' But I'm happy to report that this turned out to be an INCREDIBLE film! I just don't know where to begin.Let's start with the performances. WOW! The story had a lot with this one, but I hadn't been this emotionally invested into characters since.... well, I don't know when. For a comic book movie, the performances were powerful this time around. For once, we have a Peter Parker that really felt like a Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire was okay, but Andrew Garfield just nailed it. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey, well, I just don't know who could play that part better. The real show stealer is Denis Leary as Gwen's dad. But then again, I love Denis Leary anyway.The story is almost essentially the same as the first Sam Raimi Spiderman movie but just replace Hob Goblin with The Lizard and, well, okay, there are a few differences here and there but the way the story was handled, it felt fresh. It felt more human this time around, almost darker. The film even took some chances like how Spiderman goes into the sewer and makes this web concoction thing and just waits. While I'm at it, I really like the touches with the lizards foreshadowing that Lizard is around and the spider that follows Peter.If there are some things I didn't like about The Amazing Spiderman that would be the fact that whenever Lizard talks, he's less menacing. He also looks like one of the Goomba characters from that Super Mario Bros movie. Also, why would Peter Parker plant stuff around with his name on it? For a genius, that's pretty stupid.But besides that, this is a great movie! It's a comic book movie with emotion and solid performances. It may even beat out The Avengers. That's a tough call since Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. Dark Knight Rises better be good, because the competition is fierce this year!",9,4,10,3 July 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A Flop To Remember
","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World flopped at the theaters and some people don't know why. It took me a while, but I managed to see this movie late in its lifespan at the theaters. I, for one, didn't really want to see this movie but the word of mouth guided me there.The big question on my mind was: How can a film flop at the box office with such glowing reviews? I can tell you that it's not Michael Cera, who did a wonderful job in this movie, or the story itself which revolves around Scott Pilgrim fighting the league of evil exes to win the heart of Ramona Flowers. The cast did an extraordinary job with this film and the director put a lot of his heart and soul into this film, even using old school video game references to accompany the film. That I liked.The reason why this film flopped was because it's not for everybody. My parents would not like this movie. My siblings would not like this movie. It only reaches out to a specific audience. It caters more to the hard rock groups (which I'm not a part of), new and old video game junkies like myself, and the comic book crowd. The whole film is like comic books, movies and video games all thrown into a blender and somehow brought to the general public hoping it will work. It succeeds on a certain level but to fully enjoy this movie, you have to ask yourself: 'How far am I willing to suspend disbelief?'And that's where Scott Pilgrim falters. It has to be accepted by a wide general audience for it to succeed. It's one of those movies you might turn to on the TV and you might be like, 'This looks stupid!' And then change the channel. That could be Scott Pilgrim vs. The World to the public.But if you're willing to suspend disbelief, then you are for one heck of a ride. The core of the film is Scott defeating the exes and a lot of imagination went into the fight scenes. To me, the best part is watching the actors, because they look like they are having fun. The fight scenes, as over the top as they are, are fun to look at. I did have to ask myself, 'How did Scott Pilgrim learn how to fight like that?' There was no indication of him knowing how to fight. It just happens. Maybe I was supposed to turn my brain off at that point.All and all, this isn't my favorite movie of the year or anything but I did enjoy it and that's what I was asking for. One last question I asked myself after leaving the theater, 'Why was it called Scott Pilgrim vs. The World?' He never left Canada! I'll shut my brain off on that one too.",8,1,10,28 August 2010
Avengers: Endgame," An Emotional Finale
","I had to see this one in Spanish since I'm an American living in Spain. After the near flawless Infinity War, it would be hard for this one to live up to its predecessor, and the expectations are high. I would hate to be the one responsible for this movie.The first hour is really slow. In fact, I didn't even know where this movie was even going after the first twenty minutes. But then in the second hour, it's almost an homage to all the Marvel movies that came before it with a lot of fan service thrown in. A lot goes on, and it may even require someone with knowledge of all the Marvel movies to get it. The third hour is the final battle and its really good and emotional. I even teared up in a couple parts and I couldn't even make out what they were saying.However, there are some questionable things that happen in the movie like what happens to Hulk and Thor. I would like to say that they didn't screw up on Captain Marvel. They handled her well. I guess we are going into Phase four, but the only one I'm interested in is the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm not sure if I'm sticking around after this one. Then again, Marvel has been genius when it comes to these films.",9,0,5,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," There's A Snake In My Boots
","I think like everyone who loved the first three Toy Story movies, I was nervous about this one. I really don't want these movies to ever suck. Luckily this one didn't suck, but it felt unnecessary..Woody is concerned about a stupid Forky character that Bonnie, their kid, is so attached to. I remember making characters like this and losing them all the time. I wouldn't be surprised if they ran away like Forky.Then Forky gets kidnapped and Woody and Bo Beep has to go save him from Gabby Gabby and those scary dolls.The problem is so many characters get sidelined in this one. I get it, it's about Woody and Bo Peep, but not even Buzz Lightyear gets much screen time.However, I did like the development of these movies. This movie is essentially about growing up. It uses a dark tone because growing up is a dark world. I like that, but all and all, I think Toy Story should be done now. Something tells me it isn't, and the series will start to go downhill. Watch.",7,0,1,28 June 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 'A hobbit? I never heard of a hobbit before? Sounds like orc mischief to me!'
","I couldn't wait for this movie. I took my beautiful date Terra and my beautiful friend Gina and it would be a glorious night. But dang, is this movie long! I think it covered more than half the book!In case you don't know, the movie starts with an old Bilbo narrating as that dragon Smaug attacks the dwarfs and steals their gold. Gandalf enlists young Bilbo (played brilliantly by Martin Freeman) invades his home with the dwarfs and the adventure begins. A lot of amazing things happen along the way (I especially like the scene with the trolls and the fight in the Ewok village later in the movie) but I hate to say it, but man I sure miss Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli from Lord of the Rings. I really didn't care for either of the dwarfs. I loved Bilbo and Gandalf, but these dwarfs. Ugh. Especially, Troin, or whatever his name was, he just seems so bitter and one-dimensional. He hates the elves and finds an awful place to sleep. I swear, every time he finds a place to sleep, trouble happens. He always seem to endanger them when he finds shelter. I also don't know much about the other dwarfs other than they act like children and get mad when someone is trying to help them, especially the elves. Then every single time they are in danger, you know Gandalf will be there to save them. It happens every time. Gandalf should be on this quest by himself! Just to get one more negative out of the way, some scenes drag on a little longer than they should and I almost think this could have been made into one movie.With that being said, I absolutely loved Bilbo. I enjoyed every scene he was in. Martin Freeman's performance really captured what I think of when I think of a hobbit. Also his scenes with Gollum are simply fantastic. The game of riddles was handled so wonderfully, that I almost wished that was the entire film. Ian McKelland's Gandalf was also excellent, as always, and really the two characters of Bilbo and Gandalf are the core of this film.If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, definitely see this movie. Despite some of my criticisms, I still think it was a really good movie. I'm looking forward to the next one in 2013.",8,4,12,14 December 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Project X..... On Steroids!
","When I was a kid, I was at the zoo in the gorilla exhibit. There was this big gorilla pressed against the glass just staring at me. It was the first experience I had becoming face to face with a gorilla and it was between glass. The zookeeper told me that they can be very aggressive, and I just imagined what it could be like if there wasn't that glass separating us.This movie made me remember that experience.This is the kind of film that I go to films for. Masterful storytelling and awesome direction. It puts you right there without the needless 3D gimmick. I was engrossed into it from beginning to end. I saw it with someone who had no intentions of seeing this movie at all, and by the end even she had to admit that she enjoyed it.The film follows former Oscar host James Franco running a science lab filled with chimps, and he's conducting an experiment to end Alzeheimers disease. When one of the chimps run amok and get shot down, he discovers that she was carrying a baby chimp and he is forced to take the baby home to nurture him. There we discover that his dad (John Lithgow) has Alzeheimers and that is his motivation for discovering the cure.As the film goes on, we see the chimp grow into an adult, become smarter, and is being introduced to the world where he is regarded as an animal when he wants to be treated as a human. A turning point in the story where he is taken back to the lab with the other chimps, and how he struggles with mistreatment. Eventually they break out, and wages a war against the humans.That's telling the movie in a nutshell, but it's something to be experienced because there is a lot more detail to discover in the story. It's rich in storytelling, and there's a lot of emotion to be had. This is just something to be experienced at the cinema.My only gripes about this film is that I wish they would use actual chimps than CGI. At some points it almost took me out of the film because I keep wishing Hollywood would stop with the computers and use the real thing. Also the movie ended beautifully, but then they stick another scene in there a minute after the credits that I felt wasn't necessary other than to set up a sequel but they didn't need to put it in there.I can't recommend this film enough. This is the best summer movie of 2011 to me, by far. With summer almost ending, I doubt the rest of the lineup could live up to it. Long live the apes!",Null,0,1,7 August 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," What A Summer Blockbuster Comic Book Movie Should Be!
","Avengers 3 reminds me why these Marvel Universes is so popular. They are stories involving a well-cast group of superheroes from the Marvel comic books. The first Avengers was a lot of fun, but disappointing because there were only a handful of the comic book characters fighting. Age of Ultron sucked and it was boring but this one, well, I admit that Guardians of the Galaxy got me excited for it, but it's great to see a bigger cast of superheroes.Thanos, in pure Voldemort scheme, is out looking for the Infinity Stones to give him the ultimate power, and the heroes must stop him before he finds them all. That is pretty much the movie. However, everyone has a story, including Thanos this time, and I realized halfway through the film, that he is a good villain. It took several movies but they finally have a good supervillain to face! YES!What makes this film great is that it has a perfect mix of action, comedy, and even backstory. The movie even takes time out to flesh out characters, and it does it in a way where it isn't boring. There is always something to look at, there are a ton of characters to cover, and the movie actually handles them quite well. I honestly don't have too much to gripe other than, if this is your first time seeing one of these Marvel movies, you might get lost.What a way to kick off the summer! I was excited for this and even had goosebumps with the trailer, but this film definitely delivered. It saddens me because I really hope DC gets this kind of following. As it stands, Marvel is dominating and Disney is banking. The steam isn't running out yet with this franchise.",9,7,21,29 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Duo of Awesome
","If I didn't walk out of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and not loving it, I would be disappointed. It has Leo and Brad Pitt sharing the screen together. The amazing Margot Robbie and even Al Pacino! Well, the movie was very good but it was a little underwhelming.The film is about the friendship of Rick Dalton, a struggling actor on TV, and his stuntman Cliff Booth. There's a sub plot about Charles Manson too. Now there's some great scenes in this like Pitt against hillbillies and Leo struggling on the set of a film. It just that the film feels slower paced and halfway through the movie you would be screwed if you had to write an essay on what you just saw. Quentin Tarantino is known for that. He doesn't follow the rules. However, the ending is great.Pulp Fiction is my favorite Tarantino film but Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds are close. This is better than Hateful Eight but not sure where I place this on the Tarantino list. Definitely not top 5 and it should have been with this star power.",8,15,23,29 July 2019
Django Unchained," Hands down! Best of 2012!
","Prior to seeing this movie, I did hear some good buzz. I was tired and really wasn't in the mood to see it but I didn't want to let down my lady friend so I went. I am so glad I did! When a movie draws you in from frame 1 to the very end, that's great storytelling. This film proves that you don't need any gimmicks Hollywood shovels at you to immerse you into a film when good storytelling fares better than any gimmick you can throw out there.I don't even know where to start. I guess I can start with the performances. Let's just say the performances were so good, that I got lost in the characters. Jamie Fox, who is a very talented actor, actually got me worried because at first I thought that any actor could play that role. But as time went on, I can't imagine any other actor who can pull that performance off as well as he can. Christoph Waltz proves that you can never say that actors these days are bad. He is incredible, as always! The biggest surprise to me, however, is with Leonard Dicaprio who plays a very mean businessman, and he played it so well that I even forgot that he was Leonardo Dicaprio. I believed his character. And wait until you see Samuel L. Jackson. He was hilarious!The story was riveting. It follows two bounty hunters (Waltz and Fox) on a mission to rescue Fox's wife from a corrupt businessman. The journey there is pure filmmaking genius as this is what a film is supposed to be. It conveys all kinds of emotions and when its funny, its laugh-out-loud funny, and when its suspenseful, you are at the edge of your seat. Honestly, this is what films should be and definitely a testament to what a great film-going experience is supposed to be.I honestly can't believe it took me this long to see this movie and glad I got to experience it at the theater. Next time, when I hear good buzz like that, I should listen. I was actually thinking this film was going to be boring. I was so wrong this time and I'm the type of guy who would never admit it. Best film of 2012 and most likely at the top 10 of all time for me!",10,5,14,2 January 2013
Insidious," Insidious Activity
","Just before paying for my ticket to see Insidious, I heard a scream come from the woman at the ticket booth. She screamed pretty loud. Looking up to see what happened, I noticed someone scared her from behind. As I paid for my ticket, I told the woman, 'I hope I scream like that when I see this movie.' Of course, she laughed.I can't say that I screamed during Insidious, but some people in the audience did. I must admit I jumped a few times, with help from a rather loud audio when the jump scare happens. There are even suspenseful moments to get your heart racing. For the first half of the movie, I knew I was in for something great.Notice I said the 'first half of the movie.'When the movie begins, it reminded me of one of those old, 1970's horror films with a scary sight, large words of the title appearing on screen, and the classic shrills from the violin as if to say 'BOO!' At this point, I felt the film was trying too hard but I was giving it a chance since it just started.Then we are introduced to the family moving in, enter Josh and Renai (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrnes) who have two boys and a baby girl. They just moved into a creepy looking house that looks right at home in Amityville, and like Paranormal Activity: strange things happen at night. Things take a turn for the worse when their son Dalton falls into a coma and the doctors have no idea why. For three months they keep him on oxygen, and the other boy claims he walks at night. This is where they get strange visits from ghosts and the situation gets so bad, they did something the couple in the first Paranormal Activity should have done.... move. But then, things get worse, to the point where they call in a paranormal investigation team. It is there they discover what's really going on, and why Darth Maul is running around in their house.As I said before, the first half was great. The second half gets so outlandish and weird (though still implementing some good ideas) that it took me out of the movie. Even still, it was like the film lost sight of their main characters. In the first half of the film, we see Renai is struggling to become a musician, while Josh is teaching in school. But as the film goes on, it just seems like the two of them are just going through the motions, losing track of those plot points and just focusing on the entities and that stupid story they are trying to tell. Also, besides the use of the baby monitor, I didn't get why the baby was needed in the film. It didn't help with the plot device, only to serve for a couple of scares. This may be a result of some lazy writing, and the film itself could just be going through the motions.One last criticism that needs to be addressed and I know I am not the first one to point this out: Darth Maul. I can't help but to think that the main ghost that's causing all of this looks suspiciously like Darth Maul. I was waiting for the double lightsaber to come out. This isn't something I should be thinking about when I'm watching a horror film!Insidious is a hit and miss. It's an enjoyable experience, but it will only be enjoyable one time. It won't have the lasting appeal as some of the better horror films out there. If anyone is thinking of going to see this one, by all means go see it. It definitely has its moments. Unfortunately those moments are a one scare wonder.",7,8,15,1 April 2011
Unknown," Unknown Where The Movie Was Going
","Liam Neeson strikes again in a movie that I swear was going to be Taken 2 in the trailers, only to be a completely different movie. However, by the end of the movie, they might as well call it Taken 2.The movie follows Dr. John Martin (Liam Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones, who's just phoning it in for a paycheck this time around)on a plane to Berlin. Once they arrive to their hotel, Liz has a problem with the hotel reservations and Neeson forgot his luggage. So instead of telling his wife, 'Hey honey, I forgot my luggage. I'll be right back.' He just leaves. What a jerk.But on his way back to the airport, a mishap happens on the road and they spin off course, over a bridge and into a river. The taxi driver, Gina (Diane Kruger)rescues the unconscious Neeson and he wakes up in a hospital after being in a coma for four days. During those four days, his wife never visited him once. Maybe if he told her that he was leaving, ah never mind.So Neeson ignores doctor's orders and goes back to the hotel only to find that his wife doesn't remember him and she's with some guy who claims to be him. Soon Neeson goes nuts and is escorted out of the hotel and back to the hospital. Neeson thinks he might just be going crazy from the coma, but then the bad guys spoil that thought by trying to kill him. Why are the bad guys trying to kill him? I was wondering that too. Why did the wife not remember him or, maybe, PRETENDING to not remember him? I didn't know and I waited for the movie's explanation. When it is revealed (and yes it is revealed), it was so contrived that I sat livid in my seat. The third act to this movie was such a mess and the explanations given to what was really going on made this almost a completely different movie. Why did they go this route? Were the writers stuck on where to go with this concept? It sure seemed like it. Writer's Block can sometimes be a hindrance to the overall writing process that it would effect the total outcome to your film. I'm surprised the actors went with it as there are some good performances to be had in this. I'd rather see Taken again before seeing this one. It wasn't a horrible film as the action scenes were top notch. I didn't care for some of the jump cuts in the fighting scenes as I couldn't tell what was going on. But with some truly nasty villains and heart pumping chase scenes, it was at least entertaining. Now Liam, go make Taken 2!",6,3,9,19 February 2011
Lincoln," A Historic Achievement
","I finally saw this with my mom and my sister and I'm glad I did. To me, it's a real treat to see a new Steven Spielberg film. It's like a theatrical Christmas present. With that being said, I enjoyed Lincoln: a movie that could have been very boring but carried by strong, outstanding performances.Daniel Day Lewis obviously invoked the character of Abraham Lincoln, and brings so much warmth and personality to his role that you really feel like you are watching the real Abe Lincoln. It's his story about freeing the slaves, probably the event he's most known for, and every scene is handled beautifully. You can see the passion Spielberg had in this film, and everyone in the cast, including the writers, brought in their A-game.I can honestly see this film viewed in classrooms in the future. It's a great historic piece. If this film doesn't win a lot of awards come Oscar time, it's been robbed!",8,2,7,24 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: The Last Movie
","I am amazed at how many reviews bashes this movie and the comments I read with nothing but disdain. I had the same reaction and I even defended the prequels somewhat. I didn't care too much for Episode 2 mainly because of how boring Anakin and Padme was.So what went wrong with this movie? Let's break this down:DUMB MOMENTSStar Wars movies had its fair share of dumb moments. Episode 1 had about anything with Jar Jar (though his character never bothered me other than he was too Roger Rabbit). Episode 2 had the speech about sand, the scene where C3PO fell off and tossed around and then swapped with a droid army dude. Episode 3 had that awkward scene with Anakin and Padme about how beautiful she is, A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back really doesn't have any but Return of the Jedi had the Ewoks beating on the Empire. Point is, there's usually a dumb moment in these films. So why are people harping more on this film? I think because the previews showed this to be a serious film and left out all the stupid parts. They aren't the main reason why I don't like this film but every single time I reflect back I can't help but think Leia Poppins (the dumbest scene in the movie) or Luke drinking that milk. I can go on about these dumb scenes but for a company trying so hard to be better than the prequels, it's baffling why these are in the film at all.LUKE SKYWALKERThe main reason I was excited about this film was Luke Skywalker. Now the company changed hands, and me and everyone else hold this character so dear, we want him to be handled appropriately. However, I can't help but think that Disney's slogan is, 'Out with the old, in with the new' as they want to kick the old characters to the curb and make way for the new characters for everyone. Now I can't but think this might be a way for them to make money off of their own toys. Whatever the case may be, they didn't handle Luke well.I don't mind Luke being a grumpy old hermit. I think that idea is pretty cool. The problem is that the writing of it sucks. Why is he a hermit? Because he tried to kill his nephew, Kylo Ben, and he doesn't want to have to face him because he would upset Han and Leia by having to face him. If you really think about that, it doesn't make any sense. Luke said he saw the darkness in him and he almost killed him. Well, he was right. Snoke took control of him and now his nephew and going around killing everybody. He's a demon seed, Luke. Kill him.Then he gets the most upsetting death scene since Captain Kirk. So get this: Kylo is about to blow the main heroes up in this mine so Luke comes in as a force projection to face him and this kills Luke in the process. So much potential for an awesome finish just wasted. Wouldn't it be cool if Luke took down all those walkers with his powers? But no, that can't happen because we have another movie to make and Rey has to finish him off.THE STORYThis right here is the main reason this film sucks. Not only does it suck but it already reflects the whole series. Everything that was set up by Force Awakens doesn't even matter because the director flushed it down the toilet. When you have different directors and writers for each one, each ego bigger than the other, they tend to throw things out and change things to suit their needs. Rian Johnson didn't know where to go with Snoke and apparently nobody else did either and he kills him. Wait, let me talk about Snoke for a second here....SNOKEThere was a lot of mystery surrounding this character and I was enjoying the theories. Fans have speculated about this character and of course, it turns out this character is nothing but a generic villain. He came off that way in the last film. He was basically a hologram generic Voldemort. In this film, he had potential. For once, Rey was getting bested by someone for once. FINALLY! Someone who is actually a threat but nope, he dies. Then that wimp Kylo takes his place. Yawn.BACK TO THE STORYSorry about that. So what is the story? A big evil ship is chasing down a little ship running out of gas. Meanwhile, the all-knowing, already all powerful Rey seeks the help of Luke Skywalker. He offers training in which he never gives her so she just learns on her own. There is also a pointless subplot about finding a codebreaker that serves no real purpose to the story other than using the sets that was already established for the film. THE ENDINGWhen the film ended, I asked myself, 'What did I just watch?' When those closing credits appeared on film, I honestly didn't know what we are looking forward to in the next installment. This kid with a broom? Watch Rey beat Kylo Ren for a third time? I don't understand his character either. Why is it that he could stopped lasers in mid-air and was actually a scary presence until he took the mask off. Then he was a joke just like his very own crew. Hux was just a comic relief and honestly the heroes should have beaten them in the last movie. I feel like there is nothing to look forward to in the last installment of this new trilogy. They better resurrect Vader, Darth Maul, Boba Fett or whoever if they want people to return to this disaster of a trilogy. Unfortunately, I might as well finish this trilogy off anyway. I don't wan to see Solo but I'm going to that too. I'm a sucker.",4,14,19,2 April 2018
The Hangover Part II," I Felt Like I Had A Hangover After This Movie
","The Hangover Part 2 begins when Phil (Bradley Cooper) is on the phone with Stu's (Ed Helms) soon to be wife that someone has gone missing and the wedding may have to be cut off. Cut back to a week earlier, and Stu is getting married to his fiancée in Thailand. They bring along her little brother Teddy who Alan (Zach Galifianakis)despises. But suddenly the boys are drinking and wakes up with a hangover only to find Teddy missing and they must go through a series of events to find him.Hold on a sec, I seem to be referring to the first movie. Wait, this is the second movie. It's the same scenario all over again. Stu's now got a tattoo on his face that looks suspiciously like Mike Tyson's (replacing his missing tooth from the first one) and Alan now has a bald head. It's the same exact formula!To be fair, there are a few funny scenes in the movie that made me laugh out loud. I actually thought that the whole movie would be a rush job devoid of any laughs. The audience I saw it with was laughing throughout the movie, with a few down times here and there. Chow even makes an appearance but his return is mostly forgettable. The first scene that made me laugh was at the toast in the beginning when Stu's soon to be father-in-law compares Stu to rice. It was actually quite funny. Then Alan makes a speech and I really thought the film would really nail it if he struck back at the father-in-law who was obviously badgering Stu in front of an audience of people. However, that did not happen. So close. There were a few other funny moments in the film, but it never seemed to quite live up to the first one. Well, maybe one part involving a monkey, a monk and a bus. The audience was rolling on that one. In fact, the monkey was the real show stealer. I'm betting he will return for the third installment.The last third of the movie, however, felt very rushed. It was like the writers struggled to really find that ending that was just phoned in for the sake of finally ending this picture. Granted, the end credits helped salvage the rush job that they did, but it wasn't enough to warrant this a worthy sequel to the highly successful Hangover film. With the third installment greenlit, let me spoil the third one for you. Bradley Cooper will be on the phone with Alan's fiancée, and the wedding will have to be called off. Flashback to sometime earlier, and we lead up to the events where they wake up with a hangover, and a series of events will follow which will probably feel just like the previous two installments. The End.",6,1,2,4 June 2011
Super 8," J. J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg Collaborated For This?
","I wanted to give this film an 8. As the film went on, I was giving it a 7, then a five, and finally I settled with a 4. It's sad because this is one of those movies that I anticipated for a year now and I can't believe this was the result.If this is what to expect in the celluloid graveyard of summer movies, then we're in trouble. The concept had potential, and it's enough for me to give them my ten dollars. The first act also sets up potential, but unfortunately the actual story tears this film down. The actual story was also a kept secret by the filmmakers. It's not because it's going to shock you, it's because they were embarrassed of the end result.It's about a bunch of kids with a Super 8 camera trying to make a movie for a film festival (which is forgotten about in the third act), when suddenly a train derails and explosions happen all around them. The explosion is caused by their science teacher named Old Man Woodward. But then the military gets involved, and the kids take off with this rubix cube.Yeah, there's a bunch of rubix cubes that the military confiscates and the main kid has it in his room. It, like the Super 8 camera itself, never feels like the focus of the film as it is busy establishing that the town is in fear and the kid's deputy dad is trying to fix things, and the relationship with the main kid and this girl Alice. Apparently, their dads don't want them to see each other and it becomes a child love story. As the film drones on, it becomes worse and worse. Be prepared to hear the kids constantly yelling, 'What's going on?' and 'What's happening?' over and over. In the third act, the film derails like the train in the beginning as if the writer's experience writer's block but they just kept writing stuff just to get the script done. Everything starts to feel scripted and formulaic. There's also a moment between kid and alien that felt so out of place, and utterly ridiculous that it gets even worse right to the closing credits.As of this writing, I regretfully hail Super 8 as the worst movie of the summer. It saddens me because I was so eager to see this, and so sure that it was going to be great, that I hate to end the summer movie season by listing this as the worst. It's still early, and a crop full of movies to go. Super 8, unfortunately, is far from being super.",4,55,98,12 June 2011
Sinister," Better than Insidious
","Saw this with my mother. We both enjoyed it. I thought the performances were really good in the movie. Take the scene where Ethan and his wife are yelling at each other. Great deliveries! There's also a scene where Ethan is talking to the deputy and he keeps fidgeting while he's talking. Most performers would overact and it wouldn't come off as natural, but Ethan pulled it off like a pro!I never felt like the movie was scary, just having a creepy atmosphere. The film stock he watches are pretty messed up. Even the titles given to each of the film like BBQ and Pool Party only to see how that is depicted on how these people die is really messed up. Then it leads into this ghost which I honestly felt the movie would be more creepy without it. It's a scary looking thing, don't get me wrong. I would be creeped out by it too. It just wasn't needed. However, once you find out that it manipulates children, you will see where the film is going.There are two things that did bother me about this movie. I thought the creepy demon children were almost laughable. They just looked like make up on Halloween to me. I'm sure the kids enjoyed their transformation but it looked silly to me, especially the scene where they are dancing around Ethan during one part. The second thing was the ending. I predicted it but didn't think it would be so abrupt. It was just there and it was like the filmmakers had to get this film done quickly because they were running out of money. That's what I got.Sinister was good. I enjoyed it better than Insidious. Looking forward to what these guys bring out next year.",7,2,4,16 October 2012
Limitless," Unlimited Awesomeness
","I was expecting to see some boring movie, but boy was I wrong. A lot of my friends wanted to see this, and I had no idea this movie even existed (I don't watch TV).Right off the bat, the film opens much in the same vein as Kick-Ass, where we see a skyscraper and someone standing up on top of it: this time being our main protagonist Edward Mora. He's contemplating on jumping during an inner monologue as a bunch of thugs are trying to break into his apartment. Of course, we go into a flashback, seeing a down-on-our-luck Bradley Cooper being a loser and drinking and throwing up on his boss. His hot girlfriend breaks up with him, giving us some exposition on how she got the job as an editor. Edward himself is trying to write a book, but he's suffering from writer's block.Immediately he runs into the brother of his previous marriage, Verne. He claims to quit drug dealing, but it turns out he has a new kind of drug that accesses a hundred percent of your brain. Edward resists, but Verne passes him the drug anyway. With nothing going for him, Edward downs the pill and tests out the ability with his landlord's wife who constantly nags at him for not paying his rent. When the drug takes effect, Edward access points where he absorbed knowledge, mentions her law school studies, and sleeps with her. Soon he's cleaning his apartment, finishes his book, and the next day the effects wear off.Without giving the rest of the movie away, Edward gets a huge supply of the drug and people are after him. Normally I don't like this kind of story, where someone possesses something no one else has and there's these bad guys chasing them for some reason, but here it works. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, and halfway through I realized it was telling a STORY and a good one at that. Bradley Cooper does an excellent job here. I hear that originally Shia Labitch was supposed to play this part originally, but he had to bow out due to a motorcycle accident. Thank God. I think Bradley Cooper was the perfect choice for the film, because he's believable. I also have to mention Robert De Niro, who's... well, Robert De Niro but it's great to see him in this movie anyway. He plays this big tycoon that Edward has to schmooze and every one of those scenes were riveting. Excellent writing there.With a fantastic script, a capable director, and wonderful acting, I could only sum up this movie as brilliant. So far, this one is in my top 10 for 2011. The year is early, but the bar has been set this year. I sure hope the rest of the films live up to it.",9,18,36,20 March 2011
Jack Reacher," Reacher Rules
","I came into this movie for one thing and one thing only: entertain me. The movie did just that and I'm happy. Tom Cruise has an impressive resume. I'm not the biggest fan of his or anything but I cannot deny his incredible list of movies. Jack Reacher is one of those movies.First, let me start out by saying that, in the near future when this movie reaches cable or TV and someone hasn't heard of Jack Reacher. Well, they will think this movie has no title because the title 'Jack Reacher' is in the same lettering and font as the cast. With that being said, the movie starts off well. In fact, it was riveting because we see future son of John McClane (Jai Courtney) shooting down people with a sniper rifle. What makes it riveting is that we are seeing from the eye of a sniper and what exactly we are seeing from their eyes. Its really well done. Of course he shoots people and the police catch the wrong guy.Enter Jack Reacher. We are given exposition that he is ghost and that you only find him when he finds you, that type of thing. Pretty soon Jack is investigating the framed sniper, and all sorts of people come out to get a piece of him but luckily Jack is one of those people with a 'particular set of skills' and goes all Jason Bourne on them. The action scenes are awesome! I particularly love the car chase scene, you know, the one you saw in the commercial all the time when he's just blending in with the onlookers and the cops never think to check the people in the crowd. What disturbs me on that scene was the cops automatically finger point him for a crime. I just didn't get why they were chasing him in the first place. Did I miss something here or was this just an excuse for a cool action sequence? While I'm on the negatives here, I just felt like Tom Cruise and that other lead girl he was with (the name escapes me) just felt like characters written on a page. True, I like some of the dialogue Cruise gives out, but I just can't help but seeing them as Hollywood stereotypes.With that being said, the movie was awesome and I was never bored. It's the last movie I'm seeing this year. So looking forward to what they have in store for 2013!",9,61,121,21 December 2012
In Time," A Really Good Drinking Game
","The only way In Time could be fully enjoyed is make a drinking game whenever someone says 'time' in the movie. You will be drunk halfway through the movie and most likely dead at the end of it. There were two things that made me want to see this movie: 1) The premise sounded interesting. The fact that it's about people living off time, with the rich living forever and the poor living off borrowed time is a rather thought-provoking one. And 2) I like Justin Timberlake. What saddens me is that he just wasn't very good in this movie, as he and the dowey-eyed Amanda Siegfried both just seem so bored throughout the entire movie. They have zero chemistry and I'm even going to say that they are just as bad as Anakin and Padme in Star Wars. That's the lowest bar you can go in the chemistry lab. Not only did Justin Timberlake seem bored, but he also has a hard time conveying certain emotions. Take the scene where his mother dies in his arms, for instance. Wasn't convinced, Justin. His crying felt forced and it was. After that he vows revenge against all the time people, and risks being chased by the Timekeeper (the always awesome Cillian Murphy), and after he is given a decade worth of time from someone who is tired of living, he meets up with some rich people and kidnaps a rather high Amanda Siegfried and then starts taking time, and giving it to people, you know, like Robin Hood.... except with time. They work together, bored the whole way through, and they try to convey emotions like love.... because if you have a guy and a girl on screen together, you have to make them full in love. That's Hollywood 101 right there!This is really disappointing to me because I expected better out of In Time. What I got is pretty much a boring movie, with a premise that sounded interesting but then it turns the movie into a one-note-wonder. If I could turn back time, I would have seen Puss In Boots instead.",4,203,323,30 October 2011
Joker," My First Movie With The Wife
","I saw Joker with the wife in Spain. It's really difficult to get her to the movies since she's more of a horror movie (they call it terror films in Spain) buff but she was excited for Joker.We both loved it. I felt really bad for Arthur Fleck during the movie and the wife and I cringed at the comedy scene. One thing I found interesting is that when you see his card and his notebook, they filmed it in Spanish for its Spanish audience.Throughout the movie, it was hard to figure out if he's imagining certain scenes or not. Early on he imagines himself on the Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) Show and this establishes that he develops things in his mind.By the time of his transformation, you pretty much feel for the guy despite the criminal acts he has done. The film does a 180 at the end and changes your perspective of the whole film. This movie is brilliant.",9,4,9,9 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Popped Balloons
","This movie represents me getting through an awful experience. I watched it with some of my family knowing this horrible past is behind me.... wish the film was better.I loved the first one. This one just felt underwhelming. Starts off with Pennywise killing a gay guy and then we have to watch all the members of the Loser's Club getting an invite back to Derry. All Pennywise does is scare him. I think the only real threat is the bully escaping a mental asylum (who has a zombie driver, for some reason). Also the film tends to borrow from other films like The Thing.The movie is really long and you will feel it. The ending, like the original, sucks I'm convinced nobody knows how to end this thing. I also felt that they really didn't have to go through all that trouble to bring the kids back. It almost makes the first film a little pointless. I'm glad I saw it but it's not very scary and I'd stick with the first one.",6,1,2,9 September 2019
Inception," Insufferable
","Inception was not that great of a movie. There. I said it. I can't believe so many people from the reviews of IMDb.com to my closest friends walking out of this saying this was a great film. Maybe that was my problem. I went into this film thinking this was going to be great but that just wasn't the case. I wasn't involved with the story.And story was the film's main selling point. Yeah, there's the visuals, yeah. They are spectacular, I won't lie. I love how the world moves with their minds and how they were able to get the actors to interact to an otherwise unusual world. And normally the effects is Hollywood's only strength, to draw their audience in with spectacular CGI. No, Inception wants to engross you into it's story.Many were lost. I just did not care.The story mostly revolves around dreams. It's like plugging into the Matrix and the Avatar. Now that I think of it, maybe that's what audiences like. Maybe the average moviegoer likes characters who become something that isn't themselves. Maybe they like characters who are strapped in to a bed or some sort, plugged into something, and then they are subjected into a different world where they have to fight to survive.But if this idea is what Hollywood is catching onto then believe me, it will get old fast. People would look back on this and wonder why audiences liked this in the first place. Inception is not one of those films that will be remembered with some of the greats, especially Nolan's own Batman films. It just doesn't have that kind of impact. Visually, it's stunning, but storywise, no.But hey, if it's everyone's cup of tea.",6,9,16,5 August 2010
Prometheus," Ridley Scott is a PROmestheus
","First and foremost, I liked the first two Alien movies, Alien 3 was okay, and the everything after that might as well not existed. With that being said, it's good that Ridley Scott is at the helm of sci-fi yet again, and returning to the Alien universe. With that being said, I overall liked the movie. It started out very slow, as it was establishing characters. I really liked that android named David. He's a complex character, but played very well by the guy who played the young Magneto. I liked him and the black guy. Everyone else is alien fodder to me. The turning point of the movie is when these two guys are stuck in this cave while everyone else is chillin' in the ship. Suddenly they see this puddle that moves on its own and some tentacle thing pops out of it. If I was there, I wouldn't even go near it. However, one of them is an idiot and thinks its the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.... and it kills him. His poor buddy, who didn't even want to be there, well it kills him too. From here on out, its all action. The scene where that chick was giving herself a c-section while an alien is going nuts above her was an awesome scene. Seriously, I was falling asleep in the first half but wide awake in the second.For all that fast paced action going on, I did feel the ending was a little underwhelming. It felt anti-climatic to me. Sure, some cool things happen but I didn't really feel that the main person really did that much at that point. Heck, she was no Ripley but then again, who is? Also, who casted Guy Pearce as an old guy? Why didn't they find an actually old guy like Richard Attenborough? He did well, but he looked more like an alien than human. Anyway, for all its worth, it's a good movie. I was insanely tired but it kept me wide awake. That should tell you something right there. Oh, and the 3D is worthless. Don't waste that extra money!",7,0,4,8 June 2012
Back to the Future Part II," McFly!
","Sometimes sequels don't always work out. In the case of Back to the Future 2, it works in some levels, but the recycled ideas of the original is an obvious case of either fan service, or The Bobs didn't know exactly where to go with this one. I can tell you one thing, though, that as a kid I was anxiously awaiting this film, and I remember being so excited at the theater with my dad. I remember rushing home excitedly to tell my mom about how great it was. Oh, the simple minds of youth.The film takes place exactly where the first one left off, but reenacted so it doesn't quite play exactly like the end of the first film but it worked enough. The destination is immediately in the year 2015, with Marty, Doc and Jennifer flying in the Delorean in a traffic of speeding, flying cars. Jennifer starts to ask questions and Doc immediately knocks her out with some spray. In all actuality, this is a way to get Jennifer out of the film for time being as The Bobs couldn't come up with a good storyline for her. However, I give them credit, because what happens later was a very good scene.Basically Marty has to take the role of one of kids' in the future to not participate in Griff's gang (Griff is the son of Biff, but who he conceived him with is never explained). I guess Marty Jr. winds up in jail, his sister bails him out and they both spend like twenty years in the slammer. Now how this effects Marty, I don't know. Wouldn't it be easier for Doc to say, I don't know, look Marty up like Marty asked him to and warn him about his son's participation? Wouldn't that be easier than to nab Marty in the present just to wind up being chased by Griff and his gang?Remember how I said it used recycled ideas from the first one? Yeah, that's the hoverboard sequence. I mean, almost scene by scene is nearly an exact replica of the first film. I like the fact that the hoverboards can't go over water, but wouldn't that make Marty sink into the pool? Anyway, the bullies fly in the air and through the building and somehow this gets them arrested. I don't see how. People get arrested for accidents in 2015? While I'm at it, when did Marty get so upset from being called chicken? I know it's a plot device but that really came out of nowhere. Oh well.My biggest problem with 2015 is even though I like the ideas that was put into it, I certainly didn't like the how it was written. Besides the obvious strange plot devices, it just seemed to me that the performances felt forced, as if they were trying harder to be funny. I'm not going to lie, though, that one of the better scenes in the film was when Jennifer was sneaking through her future home. My favorite scene here is when Marty's Asian boss yells out, 'MCFLY!' Definitely the best scene in the movie, and perhaps my favorite of the whole series. Too funny.The filmmakers must acknowledged that the whole 'something's gotta be done about your kids' plot was a little too out there, so it focused on older Biff giving a sports almanac to younger Biff. This is what altered 1985, because somehow older Biff knew how to operate a time machine and go back to any year he wanted as if everyone knew how to operate a time machine. Anyway, the alternate 1985 was a little too over the top, but I really did enjoy the scenes in Biff's home and how he tries to murder Marty. It separated itself from the rest of the series and really showed the filmmakers were going for something different.The 1955 stuff, well.... it's basically a total rehash of the first Back to the Future. I did enjoy these scenes, especially watching Marty trying to get back the almanac from Biff which created a pretty tense scene between Biff in his car and Marty on his hoverboard. However, Doc's car being struck by lightning without going 88 miles per hour was something of an orthodox. If that was the case, then in the first film why didn't Marty just wait at the street light where the lightning struck rather then going 88 miles per hour if the lightning could send him home anyway? I know The Bobs explained, but it's still a plot hole.Back to the Future 2 is still a worthy sequel but it doesn't pack the same punch of the first film. I can watch the first film over and over again, as it has the right pace and the story was told wonderfully. I wish the same could be said about the sequel, but it's better than most sequels out there.",8,0,0,27 October 2010
Taken 2," MFields Review: Taken 2
","I was really excited about just the idea of making Taken 2 that I couldn't wait for some kind of info about the movie. I remember getting a plot synopsis that went like this: 'Bryan Mills and his wife are taken this time and held hostage against a group of guys seeking revenge of the people Bryan killed in the first movie.' I thought this was a joke. Then the trailer came out and it confirmed it. Not only that, I was led to believe Bryan was stupid or something because it was almost like he was trying to get themselves caught. That's what it led to believe.Finally I saw the movie with my mom and apparently that wasn't the case. He was smart in this movie, thank God, and even his daughter had some action scenes. The whole revenge plot didn't bother me. I thought it was a pretty decent plot line and as long as I see Liam Neeson kick butt, I'm happy.The set up for the movie was really good. It reminded me of the first film. Bryan Mills is a car washer. I thought that was pretty funny. It establishes his relationship with his ex-wife (who is now separated) and his daughter (who has a boyfriend and trying to get a driver's license). The set up was really good all the way to Istanbul. What's strange, though, and maybe this is just me but the set up felt longer than the action sequences. Also, it felt a little anti-climatic. It came so sudden to me and I really didn't think the film was going to end at that point.Speaking of the ending, and I will try to be spoiler-free here but there's a touching moment at the end that I was hoping the film producers stuck with... but it didn't happen. An action happened (when I thought it would) and man, it was so touching up to that point. Man!Taken 2 is a worthy sequel. I loved the first one. I hear they aren't making a third. Even though it's too bad it won't be a trilogy (I mean, they could end it with his daughter's marriage or something) this one is a good conclusion. I just hope this doesn't end Liam Neeson in action flicks. He's awesome at it!",8,1,4,5 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Harry Potter and the Woman In Black
","Let's face it: The main reason for this movie's success is people want to see Daniel Radcliffe stretch his acting muscles beyond Harry Potter. I happen to be one of those people. I also like a good haunted house story so there were two good things going for this movie. A lot of people told me to go see Chronicle instead but nope, I was determined to see this.The film stars Daniel Please-Don't-Typecast-Me-As-Harry-Potter Radcliffe who must leave his son to go battle a haunted house with a witch and zombie children. It is here where his son draws pictures of his dad never smiling and his dad is like, 'Hey, you're right. I don't smile!' And keeps not smiling.The townspeople hate him because he doesn't want to be in anymore Harry Potter movies and they even block his path to continue his plot in the haunted house. Once there, a lot of creepy things happen like strange loud noises up the stairs that he must go and investigate.... with a candle and an ax. I mean, this is some loud noises he has to go investigate and what he sees would make me run out of the house like a screaming girl. Somehow, he finds time to sleep which after being terrorized by the zombie children and have scary faces appear at you in an otherwise creepy looking house would probably make me want to catch a few Zs too. Of course it doesn't go very well but luckily he had a dog to bark to wake him up.Woman In Black has plenty of jump scares and tension filled moments. I had to mark the review down because of the ending. It really isn't a bad ending or anything but some of the things that happen seemed either pointless or stupid. Like why lock Harry's friend in a room when nothing was going to happen to either one of them? And to not to give the ending away, but the scene between mother and son: I doubt the mother would be that happy.But one thing I'm thankful for is that Woman In Black was a pretty good movie. I was scared going on, not because I thought the film was going to be scary, but I thought it was going to disappoint me like that godawful Don't Be Afraid of the Dark movie. It wasn't anything like that. If you excuse me, I'm late for Hogwarts.",7,1,4,6 February 2012
X-Men: First Class," X-Men Unite!
","After the abomination of X-Men Origins: Wolverine (and I love Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine character), I must say I wasn't excited for another X-Men movie. However, the trailers were pretty decent and it was enough to spark my interest in seeing it. Did they make up for the awful Origins movie?Yes. Yes they did. With the absence of Wolverine (with a small cameo, at least) I wasn't sure what to expect. But man, there is so much to like! The film begins with Xavier and Magneto as kids. It only lasts for a good ten minutes, but I would be happy if the whole film centered around these two kids. Magneto was separated from his mother from Nazis, and is confronted by an evil Kevin Bacon with a German accent. Kevin Bacon wants Magneto to move a coin, much like he did with the gate to get to his mother. However, Magneto couldn't so Kevin Bacon shoots his mother. Magneto goes crazy and suddenly the whole room starts moving and crushing and Kevin Bacon just laughs. Meanwhile, Xavier befriends a shape shifting girl in his home named Raven (later changing her name to Mystique), and thus we see the opening title.Then it flash forward to when they are adults. At first, I wanted to film to center around those kids but the adults did their parts well. I think I speak for most people when I say that Xavier and Magneto's relationship is the heart of the story. However, it never really felt as strong to me as I liked it to be. Call me cynical. But I was very impressed with James McAvoy's performance as Xavier. He could hold a candle to Patrick Stewart any day. Seriously, he carried the film well and I grew to like him more and more as the film went on. I particularly liked the relationship between him and Mystique. She's so gorgeous, that I was hoping he would at least kiss her at some point.There are, of course, other mutants in the group, but the only one with meaningful powers belongs to Havok (Lucas Till) who seems to be the only one who has powers that could actually help them. The others can either cling to things, run fast, adapt to environments, or fly and make sonar noises. They just didn't seem like they could be a match for the evil Kevin Bacon and his group of goons. These guys just look like they could rip through this team like tin foil and hardly believable that they could stand a chance. But hey, at least it helps with the suspense factor.I did wish that they chose a different ending and just save that one for a sequel or something. I don't want to give too much away but like Origins, they keep ruining the continuity of the series. If you watch these films in order, it just doesn't link up. However, as a stand alone movie to the franchise, it was done exceptionally well. I have renewed faith in the X-Men franchise, and I can't wait to see what happens in the Second Class.",7,0,3,5 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," My butt hurt!
","With a running time of two hours and forty-five minutes, my butt really hurt. I remember the same situation happened to me with The Dark Knight and Inception. This seems to be common law with Nolan movies with me. Man, his movies sure are long!With that being said, I really did enjoy The Dark Knight Rises. Bane was a great villain and definitely earn his place in a league of Batman villains. It's good that they did that because they sure destroyed him in Batman and Robin. Another thing that I liked was the performances. This isn't anything new with these movies. All three of these movies had great performances (Heath Ledger, anyone?) but here it really shines because the actors even had to convey emotion. That's no small feat. There's a scene between Michael Caine and Christian Bale where I almost felt the tears. It was that powerful.A few minor nitpicks though. As much as I liked Anne Hathaway's performance as Catwoman, they never really say that she is Catwoman. I was hoping they would refer to her as Catwoman once but it never materialized. But then, they never told her origin either. She just BECAME Catwoman and that was the end of it. Maybe it's because she's a cat burglar. Who knows. Also, I never really got how Batman always knew where there was danger. There's a scene where two people were in trouble at the same time and somehow Batman just manages to save them both. What did he have the script handy or something? Also, for those of you who didn't like his voice in the first two; get used to it. It's back.But hey, this is an incredible movie. The action scenes are top notch and the fight scenes between Batman and Bane are nail-biting. Bane is a powerful foe and very intellectual. Seriously, this film is a very good send off to the trilogy and fans should be flocking to see it. The only sad part besides it being over is that Warner Bros. is just going to reboot the franchise yet again. I feel sorry for whoever is going to fill Christopher Nolan's shoes. Those are some big shoes to fill.",9,2,7,20 July 2012
Creed II," Underwhelming Sequel to Rocky 4
","This was like my dream movie and I was so pumped to see it, and as the movie went on my excitement started to dwindle, and then by the end of the movie I was like, 'That was it?'For a movie that felt like a direct sequel to Rocky 4, it just didn't leave much of an impression. Right from the get-go, the son of Creed is challenged, and after Rocky bows out, Creed goes at it with the son of Duke... and since this is early in the movie, we know how this goes down.So Creed is hurt, has a kid, and of course Rocky comes around and then the final match happens. If anything, it was a good final match even if it did feel more cinematic than real this time.Of course, I can't end this review without talking about Ivan Drago. Honestly, there really isn't much. If I didn't know anything about Rocky 4, I would have forgotten all about him. I really didn't understand his motivations at all. He's mad because Rocky beat him and humiliated him? I highly doubt that was the case. Adonis Creed at least had a more believable motivation in the mix, however Viktor Drago didn't really have much personality for me to leave much of an impression. There's also a subplot with his mother that doesn't make too much sense.Also the last time we left Rocky, he had cancer and it's briefly mentioned in this movie but really the whole movie is about him trying to reunite with his son. That's pretty much the arc of Rocky in this one besides him training Creed.Unfortunately this one just didn't have the same impact as the first Creed did. I was really looking forward to this one, but it just felt there. The matches just felt like they were there, but it didn't leave much of an impression for me. Hopefully the inevitable Creed 3 will be better.",6,2,5,26 November 2018
Toy Story 3," The Box Office is Dominated by Toys
","Let me first start off by saying that this was my most anticipated movie of the summer. Not Ironman 2, not A-Team or Karate Kid, no it was Toy Story 3. Many of my friends laughed at me because I was going to see this movie with anticipation. I still maintained my dignity because, well, Toy Story was my favorite Pixar film and it was a good part of my childhood.So, in honor of that, I went to go see Toy Story 3. First there's this short, called DAY AND NIGHT, which actually fascinated me. It was a mixture of hand-drawn animation and the 3D we are accustomed to today. I don't want to say too much about it, but if you really put some thought into it, it's pretty deep.Then it was Toy Story 3 itself. I must admit, I wasn't sure if the film was showing promise in the beginning. I got what was going on but, well, there was a storm outside and my mind was lingering on that. I was thinking, 'Man, if this film isn't any good really soon, I'm going to go check out this storm!' I love storms, as you can probably tell. And I was soon regretting paying for my ticket that night and waiting for the matinée the next day.Then something happened. I forgot about the storm. I was sucked into this film. I was engrossed into the characters once more, the story, the environments, and I soon came to realize that nothing was really lost between Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2. Pixar, yet again, makes a satisfying film.After watching this film, I went home and I read a lot of other reviews, mainly those on IMDb.com. A lot of people talk about the climax of the film and how epic it is. It is. There's a lot going on and there's a lot of excitement in every turn. What makes this climax work, is something called EMOTION, which a lot of films seem to lack. You see, when you care about the characters that are put on screen, it generates reaction from the audience. It's an art form that is not easily mastered but somehow Pixar is able to wave that magic wand.However, the ending does lead to a flaw for me. It's how they written in how the bad guy of the movie gets what's coming to him. To me, it felt shoehorned into the script. It's like saying, 'Hey, how are we going to get rid of this guy now?' And then someone is like, 'Well, let's just throw this scene here and DONE!' Really, it was a little unsatisfying for me but that's about the only flaw I could really think of in the whole film.And last but not least, I cannot forget to mention Ken, voiced by Michael Keaton. Let's just say he made the movie. It was like that extra ingredient to make an already great film even better. In fact, I could hardly tell it was Michael Keaton. I had to really hone in on certain mannerisms of his voice to catch that it's him. Seriously, he was a riot and it almost seemed like he was having a lot of fun in that sound booth.All and all, check out Toy Story 3. Hopefully your friends won't laugh at you like they did to me!",10,9,12,22 June 2010
Flight," A Good Flight
","My mom really wanted to see this and I'm a big fan of Robert Zemeckis so it was a win-win situation here. By the end of the film, my mom was in tears so I know we seen a good movie.The film follows Whip (Denzel Washington), a pilot who we first see in bed with a hot chick, drinking beer, and snorting cocaine. That's our lead, ladies and gentlemen. What's scarier is that he's about to fly a plane full of passengers. However, he just passes out and the plane malfunctions all on its own. His co-pilot just freaks out but Whip keeps it cool, leveling the plane... and then inverts it. Weird. But what's cool is that we get to see from a cockpit perspective. Honestly, never before have I seen a film that really captures the whole flying thing. I never flown before so this was a close experience.Sure enough, he lands the plane but it crashes. Luckily, most everyone survived except six people. Still, people want blood and because Whip has an alcohol and drug problem, they want to put him away. So instead of, oh I don't know, staying off the booze, he keeps drinking. Everyone who is trying to help him tells him to stop, but he keeps drinking. So throughout the film, he copes with that but he just can't stop and pushing away everyone around him. The performances were excellent in this movie. Some of the conversations felt very real, and I sense Oscar nods coming their way. It helps when the writing is superb. The only thing about this movie that it doesn't really have the charm as some of the other Zemeckis films. I don't see repeat viewings or anything. Also, product placement galore!",7,3,6,5 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," All's Well, Ends Well
","Harry Potter is just one of those series that you reflect back and fondly remember. You grow to love the great cast of characters and rooting for them the entire time. This film is no exception.This final installment follows Harry, Ron, and Hermoine as they continue their search to destroy the horcruxes. Voldemort is growing more stronger, and is at war with Hogwarts (much of the film's setting once again) and Harry's friends must band together to put an end to Voldemort once and for all.Part of the fun and charm is hoping none of these cast of characters die, and how they will end the villains that had preceded these films. Seeing it with the fans on the big screen is something that can never be duplicated watching home. It must be experienced with the fans. There were a lot of complains with the last one being too boring, and I don't see that complaint for this film.I don't have much to complain about this film, other than the final battle. It plays a lot differently in the book, and even though it's more exciting on the film version, the end result was a tad disappointing. Although I did cheer for Neville. I can't see how anyone would hate Neville.This is a perfect end to a brilliant series. It's sad to see it end but we all know it had to happen eventually. It's difficult not having another Harry Potter movie to look forward to, but all I can say is: Thanks for the memories, Harry!",Null,0,2,15 July 2011
Looper," Bruce Willis Is The Terminator
","I didn't have high expectations for Looper. I hated the title, for one. The trailer didn't impress me either. But I really like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis and didn't know Jeff Daniels was in it too (and he was fantastic in this even though he wasn't in it much)and considering my mom was let down today because the rest of the family bailed out on going to the Titanic museum, why not take her to a movie? The movie centers on Joe (Levitt) who is a Looper who works for a crime organization where hit men brings their victims to a time machine, send them back in time, and then he would shoot them, incinerate the bodies so there are no traces of them, and then they are wiped clean of anyone ever finding out. That's a pretty cool concept. If one happens to get away, their in big trouble. Well his future self (Willis) gets away and Joe is being hunted down by Daniels and his men.The sequence of events are fascinating. Apparently Willis has a backstory involving his dead wife and feels that if he finds the Rainmaker (who is creating loop holes) and kills him, he can save his wife from dying. So he has to go around and kill these kids that are linked to a number that supposedly means they were born on the same day and in the same hospital. Joe is trying to stop him, or himself, or whatever, and it becomes a pretty deep, involving film.It is a little weird. I'm not a big future movie fanatic as very seldom am I ever won over by futuristic films (see In Time). The stuff involving this kid with super powers was very weird, and some romance scene out of nowhere was pretty weird too.Despite that, the action was good and I enjoyed watching Gordon and Willis play off each other. I don't regret seeing this film but don't find myself rushing to buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray. If you like these actors, see it. It wasn't a boring movie, that's for sure.",7,4,14,29 September 2012
Fast Five," Fast Money
","I only seen the first Fast and the Furious and I own it on DVD. I skipped out on the sequels, mostly because of the bad word of mouth. When Fast Five was released, I didn't have intentions on seeing it until I learned that The Rock was in it. However, I wasn't sure if the film would deliver. After some positive word of mouth from several people, I was convinced on seeing it. So on a cold, rainy day and an awful week that had passed me by, I decided to give this movie a spin.And boy was I surprised!Fast Five is one exhilarating movie! It didn't start out well. Without seeing the previous installments, and barely remembering the first, I was a little lost in the beginning. Where things picked up was in the train robbery scene where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker (who's best performance is in Running Scared) are having that fight scene. It was pretty awesome, up until the end but I guess that's where the suspension of disbelief comes into play.The movie doesn't linger onto any dramatic scenes for too long. The filmmakers know that their target audience came for the fast cars and action. Who cares about any subplots and talking? The Rock makes a grand entrance and is provided with enough screen time to make The Rock fans happy. I also like the turn of events with his character near the end. It was handled brilliantly.Speaking of the end, the climax is probably one of the best climaxes I've seen in a very long time. I think it probably nailed the whole summer movie feel. By the end of the movie, I felt that this is what summer movies are meant to be. I don't know if the director Justin Lin saved the franchise, as I don't even know if the franchise was in trouble in the first place. However, this movie might have introduced more fans. With the series being stagnant for so long, I can honestly say that I'll be looking forward to the sixth installment.",8,2,3,15 May 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," 'Kill Them All!' - Optimus Prime
","After the horrible Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, I didn't have high expectations going into the third installment. I was expecting to go home and write a review listing every horrible thing I could think of in this movie, and there are a few, but the last half of the movie really made up for it and made this one awesome summer movie.The movie opens to what I think is pretty brilliant with the whole Apollo landing and the astronauts come across a strange spaceship and some autobot. Then it shifts gears to Shia Labitch's girlfriend's butt, and she wakes whineyboy Shia out of bed. Yeah he spends most of the movie whining and being a jerk to people. He also won a Congressional Medal of Honor from Obama, but yet he can't find any jobs (in a very funny montage) until John Malkovich gives him one. However, he is soon discovered by the Decepticons, and Whineyjerk breaks into a facility to call upon Optimus Prime once again. I don't know why the Decepticons keep going after him, but I guess we need to find some way to fit him into the movie.Whineyjerk calls on the team from the previous installments as the Decepticons take over the earth. They are bringing their home, Cybertron, to our planet and it's really up to the autobots to save them. Seriously, the humans are like ants and it really shows. Like just when you think the humans are about to take out a Decepticon, here comes an autobot to save them. This happens more than once. The action is exciting this time around and they really hit home with some fresh ideas for some of the action sequence. In fact, if you love action, you will love this movie because the last half of the movie is nothing but action. It's a huge war in Chicago. Just be prepared for some moments where you can't tell if they are autobots or Decepticons. You just have to go with what's going on. Heck, I can only name two autobots: Bumblebee and the legendary Optimus Prime. I don't know the rest.The villain in this movie.... is not Megatron again. This makes me a little mad since Megatron is always made to be a big wuss in all three movies. I thought for a moment that Megatron will finally grow some gonads and give Optimus a run for his money. It doesn't happen. I feel bad for you, Megatron.With all said and done, this is a well done summer movie flick. It's another prime (no puns intended) example of a summer movie done right, unlike that last Transformers movie. I even like some of the twist and turns the movie throws out you. It keeps you entertained. Now... let's see a Go-Bots movie!",8,0,3,30 June 2011
The Social Network," Facebook Rules
","As an avid Facebook user, I took the liberties in going to see this film. I really didn't know what to expect with this one. I actually thought since this was directed by David Fincher that it would be some kind of thriller. It's not. It's more of a history lesson of how Facebook came to be.Really, it's about the youngest billionaire in the world, how he got there, and the people he screwed over to get there. They want blood. Or at least his money. So the film takes you through a series of events that starts out with our protagonist, Mark Zuckerberg having a conversation with this attractive girl. He screws it up with his mouth and the girl doesn't want anything with him anymore. So Mark gets mad, literally runs home to write a blog about her and creates a forum that has people rating girls in his school, which is Harvard.At this point, it feels like his motivations are over this girl. It's like he wants to succeed just to show her up or something. He gets a little help from the Moskovitz brothers (one played by Joseph Mazzello, the little boy in Jurassic Park) who want him to create a Harvard Facebook. Mark agrees but doesn't include them in this idea and chooses his own people to help him through this endeavor. The Moskovitz boys get angry as Mark gets big with the a new website simply called The Facebook.The best part of this movie has got to be Justin Timberlake as Napster genius Sean Parker. He steals every scene and he's chalk full of great performances. In fact, most of the performances in this movie is well done with some slick writing to boot. I especially love the scene with the Moskovitz brothers in the board room with the Dean. The dialogue exchange there is masterful and it felt like a real conversation between people. There's a lot of this in this movie and special care is given to every scene. This is a pure Oscar contender if I ever saw one.The only true flaw that I've seen might has to be the ending. The film just had to wrap itself up, and it just wasn't as satisfying as I hoped. Almost sort of anti-climatic. It's not distracting and won't ruin the overall enjoyment of the film.If you are a Facebook person, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. You might feel dumb afterwords like I had. Now if you excuse me, I have to go invent something.",9,3,7,2 October 2010
Back to the Future," 1985 was a very good year
","'Tell me, future boy! Who was President of the United States in 1985?' And Marty quipped, 'Ronald Reagon.' 'Ronald Reagon? The actor? Who was vice president? Jerry Lewis?'Honestly, who doesn't love Back to the Future? I mean, seriously, who doesn't love Back to the Future? It's one of those rare movies that after you watch it, it just isn't enough, you have to watch it again. It's been 25 years later, generations had come and go, and even the new generation has fond memories of this remarkable movie.I think a lot of it is in its plot device and imagination. The imagination is so deep that it's almost plausible that you can travel through time with a little plutonium and a flux capacitor at a speed of 88 miles per hour. It could work! But part of the fun is its whimsical charm, and the humor laced into a sort of innocence and lightheartedness felt throughout the movie. The plot alone required some tongue and cheek humor as we find Marty mistakingly going back in time to 1955 - accidentally running into his parents in the process - and discovers that he made a crucial error of taking his dad's place and subjecting himself to his mom falling head over heels for him. Because of this, he created a time paradox that if he doesn't bring his parents together, he will cease to exist. Not only that, but he has only one chance to get back to the future, or be stuck in the past forever.As great as the plot (and especially the script) is, there is one vital importance to carry this film, and that is the performances. The Bobs made a wise decision casting Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in just the way his mannerisms are, and how animated he is in his expressions. Just watch the scene in the beginning when Marty and Jennifer are outside Hill Valley, and Marty gets a hard on for that new truck. It's a scene that could bore you to tears but it was the writing and the performances that really put those finishing touches. To further demonstrate, just check out the scenes between Marty and Doc Brown (played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd). Their chemistry together is like pancakes and syrup. Neither one of them steals a scene from each other, because they play off each other so well that they almost need each other to sell the scene.As a kid I was inspired to go skateboarding after that scene where Marty outsmarted Biff and his gang on the streets of Hill Valley. To this day, it is a classic scene. But as an adult, I appreciated the action in the ending because of the cinematography. It felt like a terrible night from hell, even if the sound effects are a little outdated. The way everything went wrong and Doc managing to fix the situation in the nick of time that zapped Marty back to 1985. It was all breathtaking stuff, and accompanied by a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and the wonderful direction of Bob Zemeckis.I really can't give a high enough praise for this timeless film. Since 1985, a lot of the dialogue became catch phrases. 'Hello, McFly!' was a common use of explaining someone was an idiot in my family. I think the world used that too. That might have explained Crispin Glover's lack of involvement for the sequels. I guess he wasn't fond of George McFly. Now that's heavy!",10,1,1,26 October 2010
The Fighter," MFields Review: The Fighter
","I was a little late seeing this one, but I really wanted to catch in the theater. Something told me that this is one that I should see at the theater and boy was I right. I enjoyed the heck out of this film, which begs the question, has there ever been a bad boxing movie? I'm sure there is, but most of the ones I've seen were decent to great.The Fighter follows Marky Mark playing Mickey, and his crackhead, former boxer brother Dickey (played wonderfully by Christian Bale) in the poor side of town with a family investing in Marky Mickey to compete in these boxing matches. The mother especially (played wonderfully by Melissa Leo), as she acts like Marky Mickey's manager. Dickey, being that he was a former boxer and took down Sugar Ray Leonard, is Marky Mickey's trainer. The problem is that Dickey smokes too much crack, and is often late showing up for training. Not only that, but he's destructive, and often finds himself getting into trouble with the police, and because of this people don't take kindly to Dickey and are trying to sway Marky Mickey away from him.Along the way, Marky Mickey meets a beautiful bartender named Charlene (Amy Adams, delivering a great performance and made herself into a very interesting character)and after a brawl with Marky Mickey's family, she supports Marky Mickey's choice into breaking away from that family, especially after a boxing match gone bad, and it really becomes a struggle. This becomes the center of the movie as Marky Mickey tries to cope with the struggles with his family, his relationship, and his determination to make it to the top.This is a wonderful movie. It's well written, well acted, well told, well directed, and just an all around great movie. It's one of those movies where I sat enjoying it from beginning to the end. Some movies I just sit there and wonder if this movie is going to get better. I never got that. It was great right from the beginning. There were a lot of scenes where I felt like I was watching real people. I felt like I met these people before, especially the mother. I've seen mothers like that before. Then there's Christian Bale, who like Heath Ledger, I got lost into his performance and even forgot that this guy played Batman!The only gripe about this movie is the ending. For some reason I just wasn't satisfied enough with the outcome. It felt like it came out of nowhere. I don't know if that happened in real life or not, but it felt a tad abrupt. Also I wanted to see more of the ending than just texts telling us about where they are now. I would be satisfied with one more epilogue scene just to see what happened after the big fight.The Fighter is a movie not to be missed. I highly recommend seeing this movie. However, even though David O. Russell is responsible for this wonderful movie, it doesn't give him a free pass. He can still screw up his upcoming project, Uncharted. I just hope he doesn't.",9,2,3,18 January 2011
