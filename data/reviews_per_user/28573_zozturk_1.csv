Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worse than Awful
","This has been the worse movie I have ever seen in my life. It was not fun, it was just a simple minded, unsuccessful and disturbing. The way they make fun of Kazakh people was also cruel. I literally hate it. I will not recommend to anyone spend even 1 minute of their time to this thing! I even did not understand, why would someone do such thing and name it as if it is a movie. It is a complete waste of time and money. There were no sense of humour, it was just the 4th-5th class, lower level jokes. I hate the way they show those poor Kazakh villagers and their comments about these people. Nobody has any right of making such blind judgements about a whole country. Even if it was about another country like UK, France, Spain, etc. I would hate, as I said the jokes does not show a single item about sense of humour. I would be ashamed of showing such thing, if I was an owner of a theatre.",1,17,39,4 November 2006
