"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A great comedy for most of the family!
","+ For this being the 1st big movie David Schwimmer (Ross from Friends) has directed, it's very well done. Simon Pegg is his usual grade A comedy acting self along side Dylan Moran. This film being well scripted and performed by all the cast, I would recommend this as a must watch for anyone with a sense of humour (and some who don't).<ul><li>The plot was somewhat predictable (not the worst thing in the world, at least it had a plot) that it almost smelled like Disney towards the end.</li></ul>My opinion might be slightly negated by the fact that I'm a fan of Pegg and Dylan, however, I'm not normally a fan of Schwimmer so I hope that he keeps this grade of directing up in the future (if he chooses to direct again that is).",8,7,11,28 September 2007
