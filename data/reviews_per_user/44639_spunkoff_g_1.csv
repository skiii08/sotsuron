The Monuments Men," Dead Boring
","This film is the worst thing I have seen since my eyes were forced to endure John Travolta's Be Cool. To start with, there was no start. A rambling speech about the importance of Art. The film does not suppose intelligence on the part of its audience; instead it forces its point on viewers with bland seemingly poignant philosophical statements such as: 'Is art worth a human life?' If this film was art, it wouldn't be worth the life of a dormouse. As other reviewers have noted, there is a distinct lack of script: couldn't Clooney have paid someone to write something more coherent? As it is, the film rambles without direction, with the audience neither knowing nor caring what happens to its protagonists. Also, whilst one shouldn't be surprised by the blatant pro-American bent, what really gives them the right to believe they won the war single handedly? I don't mean to be biased, but the British fought more than the Americans and made a far bigger sacrifice. Ditto the Russians, who are portrayed as nothing but barbarous thugs unlike the altruistic Americans. So why are the British always portrayed as being loathe to fight (they don't capture Bruge)? Its like that bit in a Bridge too Far when the British tanks pull up so they can brew some tea. Nonsense. The one British character in this film gets shot by his own stupidity. If it was an American, he would have shot all six Germans in the blink of an eye. The film was too broad in its reach. It should have been narrowed down further to make a better story. All we get is plodding from one scene to another, with all the characters being instantly forgettable. If you want to see good war films on Art and War then watch The Train with Burt Lancaster, which makes the same point more subtly. Or even Kelly's Heroes. Don't bother with this film- buy yourself a haircut instead.",Null,2,3,27 February 2014
