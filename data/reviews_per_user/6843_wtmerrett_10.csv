The Lobster," Quirky and Dark
","I imagine the only reason this was made was due to the very quirky script that attracted Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz. Two names that can carry enough weight to get a script made into a movie. The premise is well known so I won't get into it here. Suffice to say that this was billed as a dark comedy and although I can agree with the dark part, it was not really comedy. I laughed out loud only once but did chuckle a few times here and there. Mostly I wondered why this was made as much more deserving scripts are out there looking for producers and funding so why waste money on this crap. It is nominated for an Academy Award for screenplay due to it being completely outside the box. The producers thought they could find an audience as it is different. I really hope this one doesn't win anything. It does not deserve to be rewarded.",2,1,1,26 February 2017
Deepwater Horizon," Peter Berg Pulls It Off
",I really enjoyed this picture and will recommend it. Peter Berg had a factual event to bring to the screen and he did so without lots of Hollywood dramatization and kept to the facts. There is enough drama in the real disaster that it does not require embellishment. Mark Wahlberg once again works with Berg and the two seem to work well together. Kate Hudson got to work with Kurt Russell who she calls her dad as he raised her and it was good to finally see them in a scene together near the end. The event is well documented so I will not get into that but the movie gives you an inside view of what happened but not exactly why it happened. Suffice to say that BP Petroleum is responsible for the 11 mens deaths.,7,0,0,12 May 2017
Public Enemies," What? What did he say?
","I couldn't hear a damn word they actors said in this movie. This film had the worst sound I have yet to experience. The dialogue was very muddy as if the boom mike was wrapped in cotton wool. The background ambiance was overpowering to the point of annoying and the gun shots were deafening. Micheal Mann is not my style of director and I dislike his writing. So why do you ask , did I set through this movie? Johnny Depp is why. I find him fascinating to watch and love his acting and delivery. But even Johnny couldn't bring life to this script. A decided lack of character development and to many characters overwhelmed the screen many times so it was difficult to determine who was who in some cases. I will not recommend this film.",3,3,5,9 February 2017
Concussion," Will Smith Scores a Touchdown
","As soon as I saw that Scott Free was involved with this picture I was intrigued. Ridley Scott is a Producer on this picture and he has a very high track record of hits behind him as producer and director. He did not direct this one. This film follows the true story of Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian forensic neuropathologist working as as coroner in Pittsburgh who discovers brain damage from head injuries due to professional football. The story tracks Omalu's issues when this all comes to light and his battle with the NFL. Will Smith is once again fantastic in the role of Omalu and his Nigerian accent is bang on and never falters as many actors do when using an accent that is different from their own. Albert Brooks did a great job as Omalu's boss and brings his unique comic wit to the role. Alex Baldwin is another standout as Dr. Julian Bailes who helps Omalu fight the NFL and get the word out about this injury. I highly recommend this film.",9,2,3,20 May 2017
Oblivion," Could Be Much Better
",If you have ever watched a sci-fi picture in the past 30 years you will recognize most the the clichÃ©s in this nag. The canyon chase scene was directly from the Death Star in Star Wars. When was that made???? 70's? The red lights on the drones were from Hal 2001 a Space Odyssey as was the name of the craft they were in. There were enough holes in the script that you could pilot a craft through them. And lets not talk about how terribly slow this picture moved. If we had to watch another New York flashback to hit us over the head with the relationship between Jack and Julia I was going to scream. Tom Cruise is a big enough name to be able to choose his vehicles but he did not choose wisely this time. Give this a miss.,3,0,1,9 February 2017
Inside Out," Pixar Has Another Home Run
","I loved this movie and it is definitely not a kids movie. This one is aimed at Mom & Dad. Yes it is an animated film but that is what Pixar does best, or only. The peak into the human mind and seeing each emotion and watching as memories are created and stored is stellar screen writing. The emotions of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear are given life as real characters who steer the young girl Riley, who's life we follow from birth to age 13. It takes great imagination to write a story like this and I applaud Pixar for this one. The scene where the parents are trying to deal with a very sad, angry Riley and the look at what is going on the their heads is downright hilarious. The fathers emotions should dealing with the situation at hand but instead they are all watching imaginary hockey.",9,4,20,9 February 2017
Django Unchained," True Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is a long movie so be prepared. It is set during the slave period of the US south and there are very graphic depictions of the physical violence used during that time. Jamie Foxx does a fine job as Django, a slave required by a bounty hunter Dr King Shultz, played by Christoph Waltz, to identify brothers that are wanted for crimes. As Django and Shultz team up the movie unfolds with much violence and use of the 'N' word. It reaches a point where Dr Shultz is killed and that is where the movie ends in my mind. Shultz was by far the most interesting character in the movie and after his death, I did not care anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio overplayed his role as he can easily do as a villainous slave and plantation owner. Actors Samuel Jackson and Don Johnson both were excellent in their respective roles but Christoph Waltz was the standout in this film and as mentioned, after his death, there is no movie anymore.",6,1,4,9 February 2017
Drive," Don't You Mean Drivel
","I get it that Ryan Gosling is trying to shed his past acting jobs and move into meatier roles. Anything is better then the start as a member of the Mickey Mouse Club. He was outstanding in The Notebook but once again, not a film guys admit to watching, or heaven forbid, liking. So it makes sense he see him in a film like Drive where he gets to play a brooding intense character. Unfortunately what he was playing appeared to be more of a character that was not sure when to speak or what to say. The long non-dialogue scenes where a waste of time and did nothing to enhance this film other then make you wonder when it was going to end. The violence when it occurred was ala Sam Peckinpah but not anywhere as well done. This story could have moved along much faster. The title Drive mistakenly led me to believe it was about driving, or vehicles, race cars or anything like that. It was not about any of those things. It was about 1 hour and 50 minutes of drivel. To bad Ryan...try again.",3,1,2,9 February 2017
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not Much
",I have been a fan of the Coen brothers' work for a long time but will have to include this picture as a miss along with Inside Llewyn Davis and The Hudsucker Proxy.Hail Caesar is supposed to be a comedy but I literally laughed at only one small part. The rest of the comedy must have been aimed at someone else as I did not find it amusing.The Scarlett Johansson swimming pool scenes that were supposed to be a throw back to Busby Berkley stuff was way too long and could have ended much sooner. Don't beat us over the head with it....we get it.George Clooney and the rest of the cast all can be applauded for fine performances. It is just that the script sucked and was not funny to anyone except the Coen's and their followers.I was very disappointed with this picture.,Null,0,1,4 July 2016
Inside Llewyn Davis," Nowhere Near Coen's Best
","I was very disappointed in this movie and I really wanted to like it as I am a fan of the Coen Brother's work. The character arc never occurred and I patiently waited for it to happen, but alas, nothing. There was no real character development and the film didn't go anywhere. Davis was in the same sad, loser position at the end as in the beginning. The usual cast of offbeat characters were here with John Goodman once again in a role that lets him bring out his weird side. Oscar Issac did a fine job and can sing but the music was not too my taste. Carey Mulligan got to play an angry women and pretty well stayed that way throughout the film. I don't see a great deal of growth in what the Coen's are doing now from their start and like the older stuff better as if was more offbeat and unusual. This was just boring. The cat was the best thing about this picture and I'm a dog person.",Null,1,2,9 February 2017
