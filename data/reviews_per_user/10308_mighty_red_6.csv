Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat make audience go wa-wee-wee-wa!
","I saw this movie last night at a preview session at the Capri, Goodwood (SA, Australia). It's not due for a release here until 23rd Nov. I must say initially I was extremely skeptical of the film, having seen the the Ali G movie years ago and getting sick of all the 'punani' jokes. This film however gave me a headache from laughing so much, I was exhausted after viewing the film! There shouldn't be a problem for religious and racial groups(as this film sets out to offend everyone!), but Kazakhstan I can understand having a problem (maybe). I actually feel it is the American people who may come off worst after this film is released (see Pentecostal church scene, frat boys in Winnebago, the people at the Rodeo and the couples in Birmingham, bystanders in NY etc etc.) There is a loose plot and while funny, is not the central focus of the film (quite paradoxically). Watch out for the Kazakh wedding sack! PS Pamela Anderson's credibility with me has sky rocketed! I believe a film like this says what we all have been wanting to say but were too afraid to, or even laugh at. In a ultra-Politically Correct world, we are losing the ability to laugh at ourselves. This corrects that! This film will get edited (Guaranteed), so if you get tickets to a preview, go see it. This is the comedy version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Last Temptation of Christ, the edited version will always be an injustice (or banned for that matter).I consider myself one of the lucky few!",10,15,38,26 September 2006
Superbad," American Pie for the Facebook generation...
","Myspace, Facebook whatever... Superbad is actually quite authentic! Yes a teen comedy that is authentic in terms of its dialogue anyway. Many males will cringe when realising 'yes, I actually would've talked like Seth!' For that alone the film is worth its hype. The scenes are hilarious and we all at some stage can identify with the awkwardness of 'chatting up', trying to buy alcohol underage, going to parties we were not invited to (let alone welcome at...) and many other situations.Seth is a lovable character for all his foibles and awkwardness, let alone his irreverent sense of humour. Evan is the nice guy who no one appreciates, and Fogel is the guy who is our friend, but we have no idea why because he is so annoying.I felt after watching this that it was realistic, yet funny and miles ahead of much of the teenage comedies out there, a much maligned 'genre'. It's more Fast Times at Ridgemont High than American Pie ever was...",9,1,5,14 February 2008
The Godfather: Part II," The Greatest
","It has become rather clichÃ©d to say the Godfather II is a person's favourite film. It's not my absolute favourite but certainly up there. It has everything and nothing is overdone. There is no 'bad acting' and the dialogue is intriguingly calm for the often very fiery situations.There is an episode of the Soprano's where the lads are discussing their favourite scene in the film. Tony claims his is the scenery in Sicily when Vito goes back to visit. I would have to agree to an extent, but when Vito scales the roofs in Little Italy, stalking Don Fanucci is simply magnificent.The Godfather II is not so much a sequel. It can stand alone as a story. I actually teach the film in high school and connect it with Steinbeck's text, Of Mice and Men.This film is simply a masterstroke and gets better with age and repeated viewing.",10,0,2,27 September 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Not quite Dr, Strangelove
","I teach this film to my final year English Studies students in Australia. I prep them with Dr. Strangelove the year before and still feel that there was so much to laugh about regarding 'the Red Scare' that a comedic representation of the era best summarises it.Good Night and Good Luck looks at the CBS news team's crusade against sleazeball Senator at the time, Joseph McCarthy. The film is factual with real footage spliced through from the farcical hearings in late 1963-1964.The smooth jazz interludes coupled with the symbols of old school relaxation techniques (whisky and cigarettes) make for a great atmosphere. You come out of the film feeling that smoking is cool! While it lacks the necessary amounts of humour at times, this film is a great example of good speech writing and delivery, courtesy of David Strathairn's character, Ed Murrow.",9,0,1,15 February 2007
Pulp Fiction," All Time Great of the Modern Era
","I loved this film as a kid and not for the violence (implied as it is...) but for the pop culture riddled throughout it. The scene in Jack Rabbit Slim's reminds me of Johnny Rocket's (tacky chain of Americana restaurants in Australia) - the film is just one giant homage to America and Tarantino's film influences.The complicated time line is a masterstroke by Tarantino, to the point where you feel it is pulp fiction (and not a traditional screenplay, which it actually is).Travolta is 'dumb cool'/uber chic, Samuel L is menacing, imposing and full of great quotes and Uma Thurman has some Lady MacBeth type qualities, and is incredibly sexy in an odd way.This film, I felt defined 90's pop culture and rounded off the work done by films like Clerks, Swingers (despite being after Pulp Fiction)etc. Rent it, burn it, buy it, whatever (just don't watch the TV version!)",10,1,4,26 September 2006
Goodfellas," Sopranos before it was 'cool'
","What this film did was bring into the mainstream a life that was always rumoured about. The Godfather probably accurately depicted 'the old firm', while Goodfellas showed us the life in a more contemporary light.It is a great film. A life's tale of not only one man, but the Mafia as we may or may not know it today. It was Sopranos before that show ever got conceived. Plus the Sopranos just borrowed all their actors! This film has everything, depicting a time that our grandparents discuss with a tear of happiness. It is a great example of what makes us love the anti-hero, something mafia films always make us do. The characters are funny, ruthless, intimidating and I feel non-stereotypical...",10,0,0,16 October 2006
