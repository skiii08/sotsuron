First Man," The killing of a legend
","This movie depicts one of the most formative events in modern history, when man entered the space age and turned it into a long slow process and dismissing the man with the epic quote for the first landing on another terrestrial body as slow and dysfunctional individual.
It leaves me wondering how this film came about; was there a long list of events and details that had to be ticked off? No drama, just get it in there and get on with it?
Was this based on a autobiography that was concocted as a quick fix by a ghost writer with no empathy?
Is it proof that some types of books is not the right source for movie scripts?
Was Neil Armstrong so dysfunctional in his private life and just a stick jockey with no feelings and emotions?
Could this have been his attempt to explain why he had to make sacrifices to cope with the dangerous and difficult task at hand?
The presentation was not the normal 'out of this world' glitz and glamour that is normal for Hollywood productions, but it was also devoid of anything meaningful and something except a timeline accurate to a T.
I know this is a part of the American history and a most celebrated moments and a group of men unique and achieving the seemingly impossible, but for me this was just a waste of time.",3,10,17,20 December 2018
The Ottoman Lieutenant," Politically correct but factual and historically wrong
",This film goes to great length to portrait the young Turkish state as Honorable and just and were the criminals are Christians and genocide of the Armenians are justified as a protection against Armenian insurrection. The successor to the Ottoman empire seems overwhelmed by the intrigues of the neighboring nations and nations far away trying to build an empire. This film is beautifully made and good acting but weaving in a love story and at the same time giving alternate facts about one of the worst atrocities committed during 20th century is just not good entertainment. That is shameful and very dishonest! You cannot ever justify genocide!,1,15,36,21 September 2017
Dunkirk," How to ruin a pivotal moment of WW2
","This film was underwhelming, tedious and not making the importance and the struggle of the men on the beaches of Dunkirk justice. 
The film has a narrative which retakes the same moment in time from different perspectives over and over again. It does not bring the story further and just becomes unnerving and tedious. The director focuses on a handful of men, mostly scared out of their wits, trying to show that men are animals (?) who's main concern is their own survival. Where are all the brave men that escaped the captivity of the German Wehrmacht, who strode on gallantly against overwhelming opposition and the horrible sights they have witnessed?
This was the saving of an army of some 340.000 men and there was just a handful in the film? 
Did RAF and Luftwaffe possess five fighters and two bombers put together? 
Was the movie so hamstrung by its budget it couldn't afford more than a couple extras and no CGI?
And what about that awful music; was it even music or did the director just buy a kids synthesizer at Toys'R'us?
According to this film all the British soldiers were cowards; really? 
No, this is not a war movie, this is not a documentary; it is a mockery of the brave fighting men who was saved to fight on to save Europe from the evil of Adolf Hitler.",1,1,1,13 December 2017
