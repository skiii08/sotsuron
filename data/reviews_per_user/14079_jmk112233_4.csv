The Hangover," Don't waste your time or money
","This movie is typical juvenile Hollywood trash. Unfortunately, the major target demographics of movie makers are boys and girls in their early teens. Girls have their cheesy vampire stories, boys either have mindless blow them up action flicks, or, well, unfunny f-bomb flicks like this.There's not an ounce of original thought or humour in this movie. Characters are unlikable, undeveloped, badly acted (sometimes over, sometimes under), and except for three, maybe four, completely unnecessary (the groom being one of the unnecessary ones).Some movies are so bad they are good. This is not one of those. Honestly, I think it deserves 2-1/2, maybe 3 stars, so it's not memorable in any shape of form. I'm giving it one to balance the ridiculously high score. Did everyone who watched this movie check their brains at the door?",1,6,12,1 October 2010
Interstellar," sci-fi is dead
","No, not because of this god awful movie. Sometimes, turkeys like this will be shot, it's the nature of movie-making, but it's inconceivable to me how such a turkey garners such high ratings, unless we realize that the public in general has become sci-fi illiterate in particular and movie illiterate in general, as a result of years of being subjected to sappy Bollywood story lines mixed with cheap cgi and pretty faces being passed on as sci-fi. That's why sci-fi is dead - the audience has been lobotomized.It's difficult to criticize this turkey. Where does one start? The premise? That a crop blight, out of all possible end-of-the-world scenarios, is being sold as a reason to abandon our planet? Really? What kind of a planet does one expect to find that is BETTER than the current one EVEN with the worst imaginable or unimaginable crop blight? And the only apparent/conveyed consequence of this blight is DUST, and the grand conspiracy of rewriting moon landing history as faked? Yeah, that makes total sense - farmers need to be told moon landing is faked, or else they would not plant corn.And as always, when our unwilling hero stumbles into a top secret operation, he is welcomed with open arms without so much as a how do you do, and trusted into the driver's seat, which, for some reason, nobody thought of filling during the whole planning phase. I won't go into the details of such random, nonsensical behaviour and motives of characters, or the absurdity of alleged 'science', such as controlling a second hand in a mechanical watch with gravity, or the sappiness of using 'love' as an explanation for breaking all laws of physics as we know it. Speaking of the much vaunted physics, was that the one line of grade school level descriptions of a black hole and relativity by the otherwise useless character transparently transplanted merely for racial diversity?For to even land a proper criticism, one has to start from a solid foundation in order to identify where something goes south. For this drawn out garbage, I cannot think of a single solid foundation. Even the 'inspiration' from Rama and Contact have been so bungled that it doesn't impart any redeeming quality.",1,7,14,12 May 2015
Salt," Awful
","Typical Hollywood action trash with no story, no logic, little acting. It's so bad it's hard where to start. The plot is laughably outrageous. It seems that movie makers believe if they don't outdo competition and themselves in the ridiculousness department, it won't sell. Maybe they do have a point, as the American audience seems to have addiction problems, and they seek ever increasing doses of unbelievability when it comes to plot and action sequences. This year's movies gotta have louder explosions, more car chases, even more impossible stunts, and bigger conspiracy theories than last year's.The first 10-15 minutes were OK. Even the washed up actress AJ managed to portray a somewhat passable and vulnerable agent. I was even willing to buy the makeshift bazooka under the principle of suspension of disbelief. But with the tomb raider sequence of truck jumping, the 'movie' took a huge nosedive. AJ is superwoman after that and there is no ounce of suspense. She will of course save the world.Am I to believe these sleeper cells take the most convoluted, most illogical, most difficult path to achieving their goals? Nothing is tied together. The onus of thinking up a rhyme or reason is all left to the viewer since the scriptwriters could not make sense of the script they wrote.The 'twist' was apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. Those who really believe Hollywood will cast AJ as an evil Russian spy should be deemed to stupid to own a driver's license to get to the theatre. So, who does that leaves the villain to be? Come on people.",1,48,86,3 October 2010
Prometheus," An unmitigated success
","What can one say for an absolute joke like this? I could throw a ping pong ball to a local playground and hit a 5 year old who knew more about not just science, but humans, how they talk, think and interact.The only acceptable excuse for utterly irrational, random behaviour of useless, clich√©d, undeveloped characters in the movie would be that the writers of this colossal mess have never met a human being before, let alone talked to one. I would feel dirty to even attempt to go into the details. This is the movie equivalent of 'it's not even wrong', so there is no place to anchor a critique; it's just one continuum of implausibility, and I am not even talking about aliens or monsters. I am willing to buy even the most outlandish, irrational behaviour from aliens so long as humans in a movie behave and talk somewhat like real humans.Why 10 stars then? Because it accomplishes it goal. We, as the audience, don't care about characters, plausibility, rationality, storyline, science, motives, consistency, coherency, reality, intellect or dialogue. And we are given exactly what we want and deserve. Kudos for a job well done.",10,7,13,7 August 2014
