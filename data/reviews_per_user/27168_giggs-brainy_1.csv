Black Swan," Cruel Masterpiece by Director Darren Aronofsky
",it was just awesome direction by Darren Aronofsky and acting by Portman .'no its just perfect' Nina{Natalie Portman}says that while curtain shuts and lose it in white.Portman really rules the movie with her acting skills. totally dedicated towards the swan queen rule. beautifully justified the character. academy award winning performance.this movie crushes ma thought every time i watch it .it has empowering thing it grows on you after every watch .i watch it 6 times.i don't wanna recommend you to watch it many times..but it deserve to b seen once at least ..it will take you on some wacky ride of cinema.anyways new and better narration by director. darker and deeper.....cruel masterpiece but beautifully dark .Darren surely overplayed his own direction of his last click {requiem for dreams} by this movie....no more over doing of loose experimental lights and camera work.but great cinematography and clever goofy camera-work. surely deserves some Oscar respect.,8,1,3,14 January 2011
