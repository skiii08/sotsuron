Howl's Moving Castle," Look in an another view point
","Since 1984, that 20 years ago, I have watch every movie Miyazaki make and mostly on cinema. Howl's is a long wait for me since the Spirit Away. After I seen this movie, it is still very enjoyable to me but there is something in my mind still questioning. Miyazaki want to tell us a love story, that we are sure but may be there is some more. After i read a local film review, the question is entirely clear now I seen this movie into another perspective.Yea, Sofi is the main character and the story are spin around her adventure. However, Miyazaki seem want to look into the aspects of modern Japanese man through Sofi view point. Howl is a powerful wizard; however his life is not as happy as other thinks. Every success had a price. He was chased by 2 waring parties who want to own his power, he living in a mess inside a moving castle which was keep hiding from one place to another place. Only thing that keep him going is his great style of hair and the believe that he is looking handsome. That why Miyazaki choose Takuya Kimura as Howl casting, in fact, Kimura is a top idol star in Japan which is share a similar burden as Howl, he is handsome, he is popular but he is not free, all the decisions are subject to his manager company, he could not date a girl openly. Yet Kimura married Kudo Shizuka despite all the opposition from his manager company. That strike the similarity that love shall triumph all. Even the war could be stop and the teacher of Howl would not stop him at the end.",10,17,24,30 July 2005
Princess Mononoke," Things in common
","Well, I have read this board for months and I am pretty interest in how the westerner react to Miyazaki's film compare to the Asian. I think i am bless to be living in Hong Kong where Miyazaki's film is easily available in every format, both in original Japanese import or otherwise.I still remember when I saw Princess Mononoke, I take my half day off and select a theatre (which only Japanse version is shown, other is Chinese dub) and watched it. Well when the end credit rolling on the screen, I am still sit there till the epic music end. There is certain people had the same experience with me that make me feel that it is really a memorable film of all ages.I luckily own the imported Special edition soundtrack, which come with a special box and a graphic CD (with the kodamas) and a CD holder (like a cloak thing while holding the CD. This is my most treasured CD of my life.10/10",10,1,4,17 January 2005
