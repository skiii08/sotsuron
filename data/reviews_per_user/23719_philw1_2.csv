Antz," Irritating...
","I'm a major proponent of though provoking movies and yes, Antz does have some interesting 'Dummy's Guide To Political Systems' moments but it also has Woody Allen being supremely annoying (his dialogue is execrable), poor quality CGI (on the whole but some is OK like the 'Insectopia' section), nasty music (Allen singing! aaarrgghhh) and a general feeling of lack of imagination and depth. 'A Bug's Life' may be a more cartoon like work but it nails 'Antz' to the floor in virtually every regard. Pixar knows how to make a quality narrative, appealing characters, humour and STYLE. Dreamworks achieved none of these things.",Null,1,2,19 April 2003
Crash," A suggestion...
","I would suggest that anyone who is interested in viewing a well written US-centric ensemble performance about racial issues should obtain and watch either 'Homicide - Life on the street' or at worst 'NYPD Blue' or 'Hill Street Blues' because any of those shows will blow 'Crash' out of the water. As has been widely stated in the previous reviews: 'Crash' is VERY poor quality, primarily because of the screenplay. It lacks intelligence and finesse, has unformed and unbelievable characters, an over reliance on coincidence (fine in a pulp thriller but not in a 'serious' piece) and treats its audience like dullards. I can only presume that this was a movie intended to appeal to the usual blockbuster audience that tried to pass on a serious concept but by doing so alienated anyone of a more sophisticated taste. Oscar worthy: absolutely not.",4,4,10,13 July 2006
