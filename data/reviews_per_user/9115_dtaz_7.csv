Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Knowing the ending doesn't spoil 'Menace'
","I was there, in 1977, just a boy of 10yrs.  I sat there in the darkened theatre countless times watching those images from a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.  It's been 22 yrs., and I can still see that screen. I'm a lot older and I've seen 'Empire' and 'Jedi' countless times as well. The other night, however, I was transported back into the body of that 10 year old boy as I sat in the same darkened theatre and let 'The Phantom Menace' wash over me.  I bought popcorn for the first time in what seems like ages, and in another comment about the older and changed man I had become, on either side of me were my wife and my little brother.  I hadn't felt that right in a long time. That may sound a bit overwrought, and it may very well be, but being there with those who are important in my life now intermingling with the boy I had been before I knew either of them...  It was indescribable.  That, however, is the power that Mr. Lucas has.  He can bring us together; old, young, male, female, and switch us around with each other and with our own memories.  I thank him for that. The 'Star Wars' saga is a simple story and 'Phantom' doesn't change that.  Good and Evil are clearly defined, even if the personification of evil on the screen is chillingly more interesting.  This hasn't changed since the days of Darth Vader.  We may want him to lose, but we LOVE having him up there on the screen.  Darth Maul may not take up as much screen time as Vader did, but he makes the most of what he has.  Also, the sight of real, live(?) Jedis up there on the screen was a dream come true for all of us who grew up on Episodes 4-6.  We get a sense of why they do what they do and the sacrifice that being a Jedi entails.  It is 180 degrees from the quick, not to mention mostly unseen rites of passage that Luke went through. Liam Neeson, Qui Gon Jinn is serious and quiet teacher, with a large dose of rebel thrown in for good measure.  Ewan McGregor, as Obi-Wan Kenobi is dead-on.  He portrays the old man we know just as we liked to think of him as being before we got to know him.  He is a faithful apprentice with the courage to disagree with his master's more adventurous spirit.  Once his disagreement is answered, however, he is right by his master's side in every way. 'Phantom' is not 'Citizen Kane', but neither was 'Star Wars'.  This movie is exactly what it is supposed to and more.  Always remember that 'star Wars' was made to be a stand-alone movie because no one believed it would succeed.  It did, and this will as well.  There are many questions left at the end, but that has always been part of the fun.  We know what will happen later and we now know what happened first.  I, for one, cannot wait to find out what happens in between.",8,0,0,25 May 1999
Full Metal Jacket," War is hell
","Stanley Kubrick, with this film, has made clear his beliefs on war.  I say 'War', because other than the ages (contemporary) of the soldiers, the attitudes and philosophies could easily be applied to any major war and Kubrick's lessons would hold true.  I don't believe he is simply condemning the Vietnam War, but war itself because of the effects it has on ordinary people.  When we venture behind the policies and grand visions of the brass, we find that war is messy and inflicts damage on more than what was intended.As with any other movie of this sort, Kubrick inundates us with a boatload of stereotypes.  We have the screaming, cursing D.I., the cowboy, the pop-culture intellectual, the big, dumb guy, the laid-back, southern brother, the big, red-headed bigot, the stiff brass, the former athlete platoon commanders, the gook whores, and the angry, young, Vietnamese males. All these are handed well and the relationships between most of them are telling of the reprioritization that must occur in the face of the larger enemy.  There is nothing more distasteful for Eightball and Animal Mother than each other.  They don't fight each other, however, because aside from trading insults, they have bigger fish to fry.  Back in the world, they would not be able to carry on this relationship.  Even Cowboy and Joker would probably never have occasion to have dinner together due to their different backgrounds.The 'fighting men' themselves are not ridiculed in this film.  There are many moments of laughter from the audience but it is directed more at the situation than at the men.  Neither are these men portrayed as icons. They are what they are, kids caught in a wholly unfamiliar situation, with little preparation or support.  They are left to fend for themselves in a situation being run from the brigade/division level without regard for the individual. They know sex, guns, war movies, and a childhood filled with the ideals of manhood and the belief that, no matter what, the US will definitely kick ass and take names.As opposed to Ike, Patton, and John Wayne, Kubric saw the average fighting man would have a completely different story to tell.  War is not fun and they are completely unable to see America's policies at work.  For others, society's misfits, war was fun, but it was most assuredly not gentlemanly. All of America's conflicting values such as 'guns are good, but killing is bad' are thrown out the window when it comes to war.  This is how it must be, but there are consequences.  Now, finally, I get to shoot a gun and kill people, but without the normal consequences or repercussions.  There are no limits.  I can have sex with prostitutes and without love.  I don't have to worry about foreplay or concern myself with the female orgasm.  I can now vent my frustration at being on the ass-end of society, yet constrained by their rules yet fortified by their declarations that the people I'm killing aren't really people at all.  Kubrick makes us realize that 'society' and 'civilization' are ideals that supress our basic, and basest, human instincts.  It is a price we gladly pay, but if the shackles are removed, the animal will surface.There are not many positives in this film.  Gunny Hartman is a positive. His rantings and cruelties aside, he is only concerned about the welfare of the men he charged to train.  He uses any means necessary to motivate them and prepare them to learn.  This is not an easy task, as evidenced by his Whitman/Oswald speech.  War, real war, not war as a concept, is ugly. Therefore, he is reduced to elevating these two sordid individuals in order to get across to these 'normal' boys what is required to make an effective Marine.  All of the fighting men are positives, some in their own way, in that they are doing what they have to to survive.  Joker and Cowboy stand out, though, as the two who aren't sure why they are doing these things and aren't sure that they should be.  Doc J, the medic, although not a main character, truly embodies what this is about.There are plenty of negatives.  The Vietnamese are all shown in the negative.  They are all whores, thieves, dirty-tricksters, and exploiters of their own people.  The 'brass' are completely negative.  They are chock full of meaningless 'rah-rah' messages, dry, company-line directives, and intolerance of individuality.  The military press with it's 'two major themes' and it's glorification of the mundane are laughable.  Popular culture and the effect it has had on that generation of young men did them a complete disservice.  They are filled with unearned, swaggering, superiority complexes that blow up in their faces when they hit Vietnam.There are many things to take home from this movie, but as for the mass audience, the main message is the old stand-by--War Is Hell!  Other, deeper messages include the parallels between sex and war; and the 'Frankenstein' motif in which the doctor (Sgt. Hartman) is destroyed by the very creature he created, Pyle.  Due to the many laughs elicited from the audience provoked by the rantings of Hartman,I wonder if a mass audience might find it easy to conclude that basic training is all laughs and exercise and, in turn, not respect it.  'Skull-f***ing' may sound funny in the theatre, but I doubt it would be much fun to be on the receiving end.",Null,0,0,6 July 1999
American Pie," Surprising
","Surprised.  That's the most apt statement that I can use to convey how I felt after seeing this movie.  I'd read the press reports and a few reviews. I'd seen the previews.  I expected a cheap, shallow, sex-drenched, teen comedy.  My surprise came at not seeing all those preconceptions fulfilled. Most were, don't get me wrong.  It is all of those things I mentioned above and more, except shallow. I went to see this with my younger (18) brother and we both laughed ourselves silly.  Make no mistake, this is the gross-out, sex comedy of gross-out sex comedies, but if you scratch the surface, you might come away pleasantly surprised.  There is real heart here.  It may be cheap and just a little contrived, but it's there nonetheless.  The premise of 4 bozos making a pact to get laid by prom night belies the underlying story.  What we think of as the end-all-be-all in life----sex, isn't.  The people we dismiss out of hand for one reason or another, might be just what we were looking for, and oftentimes nothing like we had them pigeon-holed.  No, this isn't new ground that's broken here, but it certainly isn't what was to be gleaned from the marketing of this picture. Sex, like anything else in life, is more than what we think it will be be before we get it.  It can lead to love or disappointment; it can make us feel 10 ft. tall or 10 in. high.  Every one of these four guys just want it. They don't look at the who, the how, or the after.  One of the reasons they, and we, cannot is that it's different for everyone.  Like anything else, we take away what we put in (no pun intended).It is the journey that is taken to get there that make for the laughter here.  It is real.  Moreso than ever portrayed before (mostly).  Fear of parents, fear of classmates, fear of failure, all these are portrayed here with remarkable clarity.  One of the things I liked best about this film was the character of Jim's father, played by Eugene Levy.  Here, for the first time in recent memory, is a parent that is not mean or clueless.  A parent who isn't portrayed as the enemy while remaining a parent.  As uncomfortable as it is for Jim, he finally realizes what a treasure he has there in his father.  In this country, the portrayal of a parent who, while surprised and initially revolted, by his son's behavior, he is willing to concede that he knows what his son is going through because he went through it himself, as did we all.I would advise, even though it has an R-rating, parents should take their teenagers to see this movie.  If someone is there other than just friends, a young person can see that there is more to this film than masurbation jokes, and parents might get a blunt knock on the head that may jog their memory back to when they were as confused as the people up on the screen.  I'm beginning to think that this country emits some kind of amnesia-inducing ray at all citizens once they start to close in on 30 yrs. old.  It's too bad because, as parents, we are supposed to pass our lessons learned down to the next generation.  It seems to be the norm elsewhere, but here, society teaches us to let each new generation blindly grope about the darkened room of sexual initiation and experimentation.  What is the result:  unwed mothers and fathers, teenage parents, STD's, etc.  These are all things that can be avoided if we are taught by those in the know rather than left to fend for ourselves.  You have to go to class and pass a test to drive a car, but sex, we throw them the keys and say, 'You're on your own.'  The strange thing is, if the wrong decisions are made by the young people, they are vilified.  If you think about it, this is the only situation where these kinds of illogical and arbitrary rules apply.  And that's just sad.",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
Pearl Harbor," Pathetic
","Possible plot points below.**Before I begin, I'd like to address a comment made by Jason Zepp, of Ft. Wayne, IN., in his May 25th commentary.  Jason, we were NOT at war with the Japanese when they attacked Pearl Harbor.  We were, up until the day before the attack, involved in negotiations with them to form a 'peace alliance' in case we had to go to war against Germany.  Therefore, we had NOT declared war on them and they had NOT declared war on us.  That being the case, I would argue that strafing the unarmed men floating in the water was a cowardly act, and not excusable as a 'reality of war.'**     This movie was terrible.  Don't get me wrong, the CGI people should get well-deserved pats-on-the-back, but man were their efforts wasted.  I've seen too many comparisons between this 'movie' and the film, Titanic.  I suppose I can see why one might want to try to do that, prior to seeing this dreck, but not after.  There is no comparison...other than, perhaps, the date of their respective opening weekends.  The love story that, I suppose, is to draw us into the movie is so transparent, it's laughable.  The filmakers forgot the most important rule in using a love story to draw the audience into the disaster/tragedy/war/etc.  That rule states that the characters you have spent the last 100 minutes getting to know (although they didn't even get that part right) MUST BE PRESENT AT THE DISASTER/TRAGEDY/WAR/ETC.!!!!!!!!!  Jack and Rose were ON THE SHIP.  William Wallace was AT THE BATTLE OF STERLING.  Tom Hanks's character was PART OF THE NORMANDY LANDING FORCE.  Harrison Ford was ON AIR FORCE ONE.  I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get the point.  Too bad Bruckheimer and Bay did not.  That being said, I repeat that the special effects were impressive, but the attack itself was totally uncoordinated and choppy.  I recommend skipping this farce and renting 'Tora!  Tora!  Tora!' instead.p.s.  My stomach still hurts from all the laughing I did when I heard that they were going to release 'changed' versions of this movie for its release in Japan and Germany.

Moulin Rouge!," Suspension of Disbelief
","Those are the words you must keep in your head as the lights go down and Moulin Rouge begins.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is what going to the movies is all about.  This film is not 'Dude, where's my car', or even, God forbid, 'Pearl Harbor'.  This was a true, film experience.  I didn't think I'd say that again, so soon after seeing 'O' Brother, Where Art Thou', but here I am and I hope you have the same reaction.Baz Lurmann(sp) is the most exciting director to come onto the scene since Tarantino (rent 'Romeo + Juliet' and 'Strictly Ballroom' if you haven't seen them).  He has created a true, fictional world that happens to inhabit turn-of-the-century Paris and filled it with a truly amazing and over-the-top collection of characters.  The music is outstanding, funny and touching at the same time.  The leads are fantastic and the supporting cast really go out of their way to be more than backdrop scenery.  Go see this film, then tell your friends!!  We need more films like this.  I'm not limiting that statement to musicals, mind you, just films made by filmmakers who aren't afraid to push the envelope.  Go see this film, then tell your friends!!  It's the only way to get them to listen.  Otherwise, don't be surprised if you open your newspaper one day and see that 'Pearl Harbor II: Back to the Beach' is playing in 4 theaters at your local cineplex.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",Null,0,0,2 June 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," This is why he was Stanley Kubrick
","I sat on pins and needles the last couple of days.  I was going to do something I hadn't done since 1987, go to the theatre and see the new Kubrick picture.  Ladies and gentlemen, I was not disappointed!!  I came away from this film feeling both exhilarated and like I needed a shower. Of course, that was the power of Stanley Kubrick's work, never to let you rest on one emotion.I hardly know where to begin in describing this film.  I won't give anything away, I promise.  I heard and read the adjective 'sexy' a lot referring to this movie.  First of all, it is sexy, but I think we must clarify the term. This film is not sexy in the normal sense, but sexy in a desperate and, sometimes, dirty way.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a knock.  This movie shows us that sexy is not always defined by 'Playboy' and romance.  Sex can be good, bad, or indifferent.  The physical act of love is, and always has been, second fiddle to the emotional.  The emotion is one of the things that makes sex good, bad, or indifferent.  The sex in this movie is shows that even love needs a helping hand once in awhile.  Sex can be about love, heat, secrecy, money, physical need, sport, business, casualness, and hate.  It can fill the voids in our hearts that we leave open in anticipation and it can fill the voids left as gaping wounds from injury.  Whatever it may mean to you at any given time, you must still make a choice.  You don't have to seek sex, it can find you; and when it does, you must make a decision.  Is your need great enough?  Is your wound deep enough?  What about the consequences?  Are all, or any, of these things real or imagined.  Are you awake or asleep?  How are you coming to these decisions; in your conscious or unconscious mind?There is a wise, old saying that applies to both men and women, but especially men:  Don't ask about her past because you DO NOT want to know. Cruise's character doesn't ask about his wife's past, she instead freely relates a fantasy.  This fantasy never occurred, and will never occur, according to her, but the more he thinks about it, the more it insinuates itself into his mind.  He is jealous, furiously jealous, of a fantasy. Why? Perhaps because the thought that your woman could find anything more appealing than you, even if only in her dreams, is a near-fatal blow the male ego.The production values are outstanding.  Every scene is rich in color and detail, especially reds, green, and blues.  This and the atmosphere outside lead you to connect with the emotions of the characters.  The score could not be more simple, or effective.  If those two adjectives don't seem to go together, close your eyes and replay the 'Jaws' theme in your head.  The piano punctuates most of the non-dialogue scenes and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Therein lies the power of Kubrick's work.  Who could have ever thought that the subjects of sex and jealousy could be filmed and presented in such a way as to create a suspense thriller?  That is, without reducing itself to the violence of, say, 'Basic Instinct.'The movie is rather long (approx. 2 1/2 hrs.), but the story will pick you up and carry you along.  I was aware, during the movie, that I knew I had been in the theatre a long time, I was aware of the passage of time.  It didn't distract me, though.  I was pulled in and held tight.  That's the true test of suspense.  Like all Kubrick films, you have to pay attention. If this is not a selling point for you, then perhaps you should see something else.  If, however, you want something to wash the bad taste of 'Wild, Wild West' out of your mouth and relish in something that challenges, as well as surprises you, then have a great time at 'Eyes Wide Shut'!!!!!",8,0,0,16 July 1999
The Green Mile," Another moving film from Darabont and King
","The Green Mile caught me by surprise.  Being that The Shawshank Redemption is one of my all-time favorite films, I went into this film expecting an attempt to capitalize on 'Shawshank'.  Man, was I wrong.  Aside from the prison settings, these two films could never be confused with one another. While Shawshank is about the triumph of the human spirit, The Green Mile is more about who we are at our core.  Are we good or evil?  Can we change who we are?  Why are bad things allowed to happen?  There are some imbedded references to Christ, even symbolized in John Coffey, where we see the sacrifice of His dying for our sins.  The cynics out there may choose to smirk at these actions, but I think that they would be making a knee-jerk mistake.  This film makes no judgements about us as a society or any such nonsense, but rather tries to make us look at ourselves, individually, and how we relate to the rest of the world.Hanks does his best work in a few years.  Michael Duncan and David Morse, I think, are the most compelling, however.  I've heard criticism that the film is 'too long,'  I don't really know how to repond to that argument other than to ask the person if they came to that conclusion before having seen the film.  If a film grabs and interests you, then holds that attention, then there is no way one should be able to make that claim about The Green Mile.  It is the length it should be and needed to be.  I enjoyed it immensely and will put in in my top ten for the year.One last note to the cynics among us:  cynicism does not automatically make one smart or thoughtful.  In fact, it can be a good thing.  I only say that to remind you that just because a film, book, song, or event is about something 'good' does not automatically make it bad or untrue.",Null,1,1,30 December 1999
