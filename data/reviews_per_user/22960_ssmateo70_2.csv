Requiem for a Dream," Aronofsky is gifted
","Words cannot describe what requiem for a dream is. It is less of a film and more of an experience. If you go to the movie's website, you'll start to understand the tone of the film. Aronofsky holds nothing back as he chronicles the 4 seasons of 4 entirely different people who become dependent on drugs. When my son gets to be a teenager I will show him this film. It's the most powerful anti-drug message I've ever seen. The end of the film leaves you feeling so sad. These are characters that you know. Everybody has to relate to one of these four characters on some level. I cared about and went through the year of ups and downs with them. The emotion and the acting swept me away and I fell for each of these characters. Then the ending hit me so hard. It's funny but after the movie was over I had an overwhelming urge to be with my family. This director and this movie are the new standard of modern cinema. I wish all movies were as compelling and powerful as this film. It has no A-list stars and no bullet-time effects but it's emotion and story are more appealing and interesting than any of that other stuff. 10/10",10,0,1,16 January 2002
Fight Club," fighting and violence
","Fight club is not about fighting. It's about violence, commercialism, reality, and so many other things. It's about anarchy, disorder, and, yes, even soap. The movie works on so many levels. There isn't a second in this movie where I was bored. Some movies have weak spots or a scene that takes away from the film. Fight club doesn't suffer from that. Every character, every line of dialogue, and every scene in the movie is so interesting and clever. The performances are awesome, David Fincher does an amazing job as well (can't wait for his next). A great movie that is about more than just fighting and violence and yet revolves entirely around those two things. 9/10",9,0,1,16 January 2002
