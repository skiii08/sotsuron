The Avengers," Total Entertainer
","The movie is complete entertainer. What DC has created with Justice League, Marvel has answered with Avengers. Though Wolverine is to be a part of Marvel world, as he has a complete Movie franchise at his disposal, we do not get to see him here. The Bunch of characters assembled for the Group (or rather force) are so conflicting, yet they perform good enough in the movie. The SFX in the movie are good and not sketchy. The character development is good, especially of Iron Man and Captain America. The constant tiff happening between them reminds of Batman-Supermen ego battles. The sequel is about to come, guessing by the scenes after titles. The 3D is better than the last 3D movie. Personally I liked the characters of Tony Stark, Captain America and Bruce Banner. Yes, The HULK. His comments in rage are comic as they are meant to be.",8,3,8,29 April 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Character Mismatch
","Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character as strong as Sherlok Holmes's character butchered in the movie. What a pity! Please remove Sherlok Holmes's name from the movie and surely it rocks, but please don't depict well polished character of Holmes's as dirty, unshaven and lanky goon. Though the action sequences were good, but then you cannot boast about special effects in these days of advanced technology. The story is also engaging enough and visually pleasing. The 1900's London is described well though.Please note that the Holme's character in the book is shown as eccentric, not mad as there in movie. Hope, Movie's Holmes learns some manners before another movie in the series. Well you can watch it for just fun.",4,0,2,12 November 2011
