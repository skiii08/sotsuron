Skyfall," Knocked it out of the park!!
","After the disappointing film that was Quantum of Solace, I have to say that Skyfall blew it out of the park for me. Everything about it was just amazing, the locations, the acting, the action scenes, the soundtrack, the story. It really made up for the unfortunate reception that Quantum of Solace was. I loved that we really got to see Bond in a state that I don't think we've ever seen him in before. He had to play Silva at his own game in order to beat him. And that's why I think that Silva is such a great Bond villain. Because he's worked for M16 before, he knows them. How they work, and that always put him one step ahead, which made him different. Some of the previous villains felt they were one step ahead with Silva he already was. His plan had worked that even though it looked like Bond and M had won and the game was over in fact it had only just begun. That's genius. M was walking into her own grave effectively and that was all down to Silva. Kudos to the writers because it's one of the most brilliant films I've watched in a while. They've taken the franchise to whole new level and I really can't wait to see Spectre. The only problem I have with it, is how Silva died. I feel like a stab in the back wasn't exactly a great villain death, but then they did the same with Le Chiffre and Dominic Greene so I suppose it doesn't really matter. It just would have been nice if M had killed him or something like that. I have to give exceptional praise to Javier Bardem for playing Silva so wonderfully. Amazing actor. His scenes were great!! The cast were amazing as well!! Perhaps I'm being biased because I'm a massive Bond fan and have been ever since I was a kid, but even so they deserve a lot of credit. Great film!!",10,2,7,17 March 2015
