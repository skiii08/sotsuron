It," Amazing Remake. They really did well with this one. Must See!!
","Stephen King said that he wasn't expecting it to be this good and I know exactly what he was talking about. They really did well with this movie. Can't wait to see it again. I saw it in a IMAX. Easily in the top 3 of the best movie so far this yr. The acting was spot on, very impressed with how the kids scenes. The movies special effects were perfect with the book. Must see while it is still in theaters.",9,3,5,15 September 2017
