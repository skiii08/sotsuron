Walk the Line," Simply wonderful
","I can honestly say that I just smiled throughout this whole film. I don't think I can give a clear reason why. I just did. It's one of these films that happens to tick all the boxes (for me, personally). It was so wonderfully made, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon absolutely nailed their parts and the music was fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserved to win the Oscar for his performance. OK, I might just be saying this because I love the guy but seriously, it was top quality acting (from both lead roles). At the end of the film all you will feel like doing is kicking back and relaxing to some of Johnny Cash's music.A joy to watch, leaving you with a warm feeling in your heart.",10,0,0,1 March 2013
