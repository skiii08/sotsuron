Hereditary," A Sublime Psychological Horror Film That Really Gets Into Your Head
",Hereditary stars Toni Collette; in a flawless performance as a woman on the verge who goes back to her mother's home to bury her and ends up staying with her husband (Gabriel Byrne) and two children (Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro) in the home; which emits a sense of utter dread and alienation. The more that Collette digs; the deeper the terror grows. A brilliant climax and all-around superlative performances from a well-suited cast make Hereditary a contender for the best horror film of the 2010s.,10,0,1,22 March 2020
Detroit," Harrowing and Uncompromising in Its Handling of Unimaginably Sensitive Material
",Kathryn Bigelow directs this docudrama that depicts a racially charged police raid on an unlicensed club that would begin the infamous 12th Street Riots. Caught in the cross-hairs are a struggling R&B group called the Dramatics and two college co-eds visiting the club for weekend partying. The events unravel in heartbreaking and enraging ways. What would initially begin as a sadistic prank to ward off the co-mingling of the white females and black males leads to uncomprehensibly devastating results for all involved. A truly grim look at these events the picture veers far from sentimentality which keeps it at a clipped pace and allows for more structure surrounding the state of affairs amid the egregious hotel raid.,9,0,2,22 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Robbins and Freeman make a great team in this moving; if slightly overrated, Stephen King adaptation.
","Do I feel that the Shawshank Redemption should be on the Top 100 films of all time list? No. Do I feel it is the best King adaptation out there? No. Did I thoroughly enjoy it? Yes.
Disregarding the answer to the first two questions; what we have here is a pretty watered down story about a man (Tim Robbins) who is imprisoned for the murder of his adulterous wife and her lover. While there he becomes a 'better person' through the tutelage of a co-inmate; Morgan Freeman in a pleasantly subdued performance, who shows him the ropes of prison life. Everyone knows how the end of the film goes; but it is getting there that is the fun part, for the most part. There are scenes in the film of great fascination; scenes that may haunt you, scenes that may evoke shrill laughter, and scenes that may cause you to ponder the meaning of life. Overall viewing is worthwhile but not essential as this site and various others would lead you to believe.",8,0,0,7 December 2019
