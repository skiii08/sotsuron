Casablanca," A film that deserves all of the praise it gets.
","Casablanca is a romantic drama in a World War II setting that contains aspects that ultimately make it one of the greatest films ever made. The effective use of the drama and the development of each character makes the film a stunning example of how a movie should be made. The most impressive visual aspect (of which this review is mostly centered) is the lighting work found in the movie. The lighting ultimately sets the tone and mood for the film in a variety of scenes and is sometimes used just to impress the viewer. Early in the film a spotlight pans over our lead character, Rick, which helps expand upon the setting of a Nazi occupied and policed territory. There is also the scene in which we view Rick's shadow tinkering with and removing money from his safe. This allows us to feel imposed by Rick's presence and feel as if we are intruding upon his time. Mood is set extremely well with lighting in the scenes where Rick is drinking and remembering his past with Ilsa. The past seems bright and positive while the current seems much darker and the feeling of remorse and regret is played effectively while Rick is at the bar. Perhaps the best example of lighting enhancing a scene's mood and tone is when Ilsa appears in the caf√© at night and the entire room lights up with her appearance, as if it was being produced by her. These uses of lighting enhance the film incredibly and engross the audience entirely. Light work aside 'Casablanca' is an incredible film that more modern films should take notes from. It is without a doubt one of the best films ever made and no amount of praise can properly justify the unbelievable quality of the film.",Null,2,3,13 May 2011
Annie Hall," Comedy and then some.
","Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' is a romantic comedy that likely defined the genre after it's release. The style of comedy found in 'Annie Hall' sets itself apart from many other comedies that come before it in that it employs more social commentary and 'big questions' (such as the meaning of life)throughout the writing. Woody Allen has a affliction that possesses him to be overly neurotic in everything he does. This ultimately leads to his films having more messages and meanings to them then one would find in a more traditional comedy. 'Annie Hall' itself employs a variety of devices that make it stand out as film, comedy or otherwise. The fourth wall is broken often and characters have a tendency to break out of their scenes to explain a concept or situation, sometimes stress a point, and talk to the audience. This is sometimes used in a different manner such as flashbacks. A scene in particular takes our lead character back to his childhood and he describes his first jumps into romance and the significance of the human race. However instead of being a recount of events it is merely the characters as they are only in their past situations and remarking on what events were like. This method is clever and funny, meaning it is essentially doing it's job. The film explores Woody Allen's life, even though it is not meant to do so, and is a film that touches the lives of anyone who has experienced romance in the same manner as Allen and those who have feelings similar to his. The clever and intelligent writing along with reality sometimes being thrown out the window makes 'Annie Hall' a wonderful comedy that not everyone will enjoy but can generally understand.",Null,0,0,13 May 2011
The Graduate," An exceptional example of New Hollywood
","Mike Nichol's 'The Graduate' is an astonishing film that explores new possibilities that films prior to the fall of the Hays Code were incapable of. 'The Graduate' has a many qualities that make it an amusing film, and a remarkably good one at that. The characters are incredibly realistic and are the kind that one, especially young college men, can find themselves relating to. The film plays upon the realistic struggle that many youths find when finishing school, not knowing exactly what is next and where they should step in life. It also touches upon themes that would normally never be seen in films such as sexual affairs, moral debauchery, and the troubles of modern American homes. If any aspects stand out for the film it is the phenomenal use of editing and the soundtrack. The editing is more than respectable as it is used in a variety of stunning ways. The transitions from scene to scene and the time lapse effects are the most notable. The soundtrack which consists strictly of music performed by Simon and Garfunkel sets a mood throughout the film and from scene to scene depending on the song made and overall makes for a more emotionally effective experience. In short 'The Graduate' is a film that is both both funny and touching as it goes beyond the content of a comedy-drama at the time and if anything sets the standard for those to come. The movie is great on both a technical and theoretical level and ultimately is a movie that can be enjoyed by variety of audiences.",Null,0,0,13 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," A Definitive Musical
","Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's 'Singin' in the Rain' is the musical to define musicals. A depiction of the transition from silent films to those with sound 'Singin' in the Rain' displays the world of late 1920's early 1930's Hollywood in a comedic way and is an amusing film for it. The film employs a variety of dances and music from various genres' ranging from Latin beat to Jazz, including the Charleston and samba dancing. Dance and musical numbers are often used as a means of stressing a point that would often be made as straightforward dialogue in traditional movies. Instead of stressing a point characters chose to perform a song and dance that displays their feelings or opinions of a situation. It is not unlike the exaggerated motions of those who acted in silent films. 'Singin' in the Rain' is in all ways a classic. The movie is must for any who enjoy musicals and it is a proper example of what content makes for a well made one. Consistently funny and always engrossing 'Singin' in the Rain' stands the test of time and is film enjoyable by practically anyone capable of appreciating song ad dance.",Null,0,1,13 May 2011
