The Blair Witch Project," Root for the Witch!
","What an over-hyped, brain-dead waste of film, time and website space! TBWP is the type of scam that Barnum dreamed of! A cottage industry ( comics, computer games, etc. ) has been spawned out of NOTHING!!! The annoying hand-held camera-work looks worse on TV, and will probably induce convulsions for many people...The characters are about as likable as the Scooby Doo bunch ( and the characterizations are about as deep! )By the time these idiot Gen-X kids meet their demise, you'll deem it merciful....for you, the viewer! Want a good terror-in-the-woods film? Try Evil Dead 1 or 2....hell, try Equinox, as least you'll get a laugh!",1,22,45,20 November 2000
Saturday Night Fever," An Indictment Of Machismo and Urban Tribalism....
","Anyone who read Nik Cohn's original New York Magazine piece ('Tribal Rights Of The New Saturday Night') would know that the article, and the subsequent film, are meant to CRITICIZE urban tribalism ('neighborhoodism'), machismo, racism, sexism, etc.....not glorify these ideas! Although the real-life Tony Manero (a fellow named Eugene Robinson) and his friends were a multi-ethnic group, other aspects of their behavior were dissected in the piece. The film chose to change their ethnic background to Italian, and take potshots at urban Italian culture circa 1977. The disco/dancing leitmotif was meant to be exactly that, a leitmotif. I never realized how many people missed the entire point of the film until I went to see the God-awful play here in NY....these people were APPLAUDING the stereotypes portrayed! The Faces are supposed to be ignorant, sexist, violent near-thugs, not role-models.....that is why Manero leaves them at the end of the film. It amazes me when people emulate and glorify negative stereotypes (like the Italian-Americans who emulate 'The Sopranos'!) Part of the problem is that many people see the censored versions of the film, where the negative behavior is censored. The R-rated film is the only legitimate version. The PG/PG13 versions are inane (hey, guys, let's put out a PG, dumbed-down version of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.....so the kids can hear all the GREAT MUSIC!).SNF wasn't the only film at the time to attack ethnic tribalism, NUNZIO and BLOOBROTHERS are other films that examine similar themes.",10,1,3,4 September 2001
Pearl Harbor," Coming Soon: The Rape Of Nanking, The Musical! From Disney!
","What a brilliant parody of WWII films this was, almost on a comedic par with an episode of Hogan's Heroes! My favorite bit of merriment? 'I think WWII's just started!' Hilarious! I think this would make a great  sitcom with....what? It was supposed to be a 'drama'? You have got to be kidding....with that dialogue? With that script? With the myriad historical inaccuracies? I am appalled and amazed at the number of positive and mixed reviews for this inane mall-rat bait. The dumbing down of America continues unabated, it would seem. Two things for the brain-dead mall-rats to do: first, rent Tora, Tora, Tora to maybe learn a little about the history of the incident. Secondly, open up a book about Pearl Harbor and READ IT!!!!",1,0,0,4 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," Day Of Infamy.....for DISNEY!!!
","Well this bit of execrable cinema (along with the failure of Atlantis) has caused at least one Disney honcho his job, and hopefully there are many more firings to come. Way to go, Disney... keep on making films for 12-year-old mall rats and adults with double-digit IQs. I'm sure Uncle Walt is rolling over in his grave!",1,0,1,13 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Jose Ferror Is Rolling Over In His Grave
","After seeing this film, and the repellent ROMEO AND JULIET, I'm fairly sure Baz Luhrmann is the AntiChrist. I'm sure epileptics around the country have run away from the theatre screaming. This film is an assault on the senses. It is nearly as stupid and loud as PEARL HARBOR (nearly as stupid and long, nothing could be as horrific as the wretched PEARL HARBOR).",1,1,5,26 March 2002
Tombstone," You're No Daisy If You Miss This!
","This is Val's finest hour, no doubt about this. Non-Western and non-Kilmer fans still are amazed at his performance. Val chews the scenery, digests the scenery....you get the picture. His lack of an Oscar is yet another in the long litany of Academy Award buffoonery. The scenes where he confronts Michael Biehn are highly charged: Biehn looks at Kilmer and sees his future, and it frightens him. The film suffers in terms of continuity, but a lot of the continuity was left on the cutting-room floor: the relationship between Billy Zane and Jason Priestly; and scenes between Kilmer and Joanna Pacula, etc. Hopefully these scenes will be in the inevitable 'director's cut' DVD. This version will hopefully showcase the secondary actors such as the excellent Stephen Lang, and of course more of Val Kilmer! Too bad that his later career has been, shall we say, somewhat erractic ( Dr.Moreau....AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!)",Null,0,0,20 November 2000
