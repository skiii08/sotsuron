The Lobster," A Very Odd, Yet Captivating Film
","I have known about this movie for quite some time now, but I have always found different reasons to neglect to watch it until now. I always thought that the film looked really weird, which ultimately steered me away from watching it. I finally decided to give it watch, and even though it ended up being far weirder and much darker than I originally expected it to be, I was not pleasantly surprised. The dark humor and extremely cringe-inducing interactions between the characters was incredibly amusing, and was something that you do not see very often in cinema. I also really liked the unique plot of the film, even though it could be confusing at times. The entire cast was great as well, and they all added a lot to the film in their own ways. There were only a few problems that I really had with the film. One being that it was a little long, and really dragged on at times. I think that a few scenes could have been removed to prevent that from happening. The only other issue that I had was the ending. It felt a little bit rushed, and then it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, which I was not a particularly big fan of. All in all though, it is definitely a film that I would recommend to you if you like original ideas, great acting, and clever dark humor.",7,1,2,17 December 2019
Marriage Story," Not as emotional as I thought it would be
","When I first saw the trailer for this film it brought tears to my eyes. It seemed to me like it was going to be a roller coaster of emotions, and I really expected it to be one of the best films of the year. Don't get me wrong, it is by no means a bad movie. The acting is without a doubt some of the best that I have seen, and I believe that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserve Oscar nominations for how well they did in the film. Unfortunately, I personally was not all that affected by their emotional performances, and had a lot of trouble connecting with their characters. I think older audiences, as well as anyone who has been through a divorce will connect with the film a lot more than I did. That was really my big problem with the film, apart from their child being extremely annoying at times. Other than that, the film is very well made, I did not get bored at any point, although I think it could have been 10 minutes shorter. If it were not for the fact that I felt no attachment to the characters, I would likely give this film a much higher review, likely an 8 or a 9, but I just really wasn't feeling it. Still, definitely a great film in every other regard, and I am likely in the minority about how I felt about the characters, so I would recommend giving it a watch so you can form your own opinion on it.",6,224,370,13 December 2019
