Angels & Demons," Worst book to movie adaptation ever
","It should be called something else, because it does not have the same story. Why would you even try making this movie if you intended right from the get go to change the most important aspects of the books. To make money is the answer. I will never watch another Ron Howard film again. Butchered is the word that best describes what they do to the plot and the character development. What a waste. I have never been so betrayed in my life. The book was leaps and bounds over the movie, where as his second book was covered much better by the movie. What a sad day this is. I will always remember how holly wood has failed me. The day of reckoning will come, all will know the evils of the industry when I get my revenge. I will have plenty of followers, and they will believe in the cause for they believe in their rights as a person on this earth. Or perhaps i will just forget about this movie read the book again and then go see a movie based on a movie that was based on a movie that was remade 10 years later to appeal to a different audience.",1,8,13,18 June 2010
