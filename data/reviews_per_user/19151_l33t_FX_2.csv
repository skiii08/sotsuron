Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Excellent yet lacking
","I liked Vol 2 a lot.  While I was watching it in the theater I felt that I liked the second more than the first.  But now that I look back I don't like one more than the other.  I like the first one for the fight scenes, and the second one for the wonderful plot, the story was so great.  The only bit that was lacking was the fighting.  I was expecting elaborate grand finale sword fighting scenes; instead of Fire Works I was awarded with a Flash in the Pan.  The bride simply killed or disabled her opponents to fast.  I do believe that I liked the sound track to Vol 2 better.  I really enjoyed the back story of her training with Pai Mei.  I wouldn't have minded seeing even more of her training with her master.  Of course there was a purpose for it and QT had to keep the movie going.  Overall quite good.",8,1,2,16 April 2004
Memento," The best film I've experienced since 'The Matrix'
","I knew within the first 10 minutes of this film that I would love it, and I do.  Not only is the idea of the 'ten minute man' intriguing, but the way the story is told is simply delicious.  I recommend anyone to buy the dvd, or at least rent it, and make sure you read the short story 'Memento Mori' which is included on the DVD.",10,0,1,26 October 2001
