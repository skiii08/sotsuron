The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," I loved the movie, a must see!
","I have read a lot of bad reviews about this movie, just like the other twilight movies, but I found this movie to be much better than I expected. The wedding at the beginning was very sweet and touching, and the honeymoon phase..well Bella(Kristen Stewart) did seem kinda desperate for Edward, but still wasn't that bad. You also see Jacob's feelings for Bella, and Bella shows how much she cares for him as well. The birthing scene was a little more graphic than I thought, but it kept me on my seat. I thought when reading the book that Jacob imprinting on a baby was disgusting and questioned why she wrote that, however, the movie shows how he sees her in the future and how much he will love her, and that is why he is imprinted to Renesme. I loved the movie overall and it was very sweet and touching. I just wonder, pretty much most of the 4th book was in the 1st part, i don't know what they are going to put in the 2nd part, but i will have to wait and see :)",10,2,8,24 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," I simply love this movie!!!!
","I read a lot of the other reviews about this movie and i think people are being too judgmental and harsh. Guys seem to not like the fact that Edward(the vampire) sparkles, well this isn't an action movie, it's a romance,so to me vampires sparkling in the sunlight was a great choice. You really feel the emotional impact Edward and Jacob(the werewolf) have on Bella, and her dilemma on who she wants to be with. You have Edward, who is romantic and sweet, but being with him will mean she will have to become a vampire and leave her family. And you have Jacob, the warm, loving guy who can give her a life where she can still be with her family, but she doesn't love him as much as she loves Edward. There is just a lot of emotional scenes in the movie and it is so warming to watch! And guys, when you see this movie, it isn't ACTION, it is ROMANCE,there isn't a lot of fighting scenes and the movie isn't like the old vampire movies. I am not degrading old vampire movies, i love them, but i love this movie as well. I don't expect most guys to like it or understand this movie, and i know guys aren't going to act this way in real life( wouldn't want them to, it would be over dramatic in real life) but maybe you should think about being a little bit more emotional and romantic. But to me, the movie is very heart-warming and sweet. In Eclipse, Jacob and Edward are still fighting over Bella, but they put their differences aside to help Bella out, since she is in danger, and Edward and Jacob seem to have a small friendship building up. I also enjoyed the movie because it had more action than the first two movies and had another plot to it other than Jacob and Edward wanting Bella. I loved the ending, where the Cullen Clan was fighting the young vampires! Edward's ring that he gives to Bella was so stunning, and it makes you excited to see the next movie, when they get married. A lot of people have criticized this movie, but I enjoyed every moment of watching it. I am a big Twilight fan and this was the best movie so far. Most guys won't like this movie since it isn't an action movie,but I recommend that every girl should watch this movie. Some girls don't like the movie either, however, but I highly recommend watching it! I love Eclipse and I can't wait to see the next two movies for Book 4! Will be sad when the series is over!",10,4,9,14 January 2012
