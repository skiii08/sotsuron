Blade Runner 2049," A beautiful story, in every way
","The original 'Blade Runner' is a sci-fi classic, and I was concerned about whether the new installment in the franchise will be a worthy descendant. Fortunately, it exceeded all my expectations, and while my rating wasn't that high at first, I think I have to give it a 10.It's definitely not a movie for action fans. It lasts almost 3 hours, and the pace is relatively slow. We meet K, a replicant, whose job at LAPD is to hunt and kill other replicants. After he discovers the remains of an artificial woman who was in some way able to birth a child, he embarks on a journey to discover his true self and hunt down the remaining memories of an unclear past.A fair share of the movie's runtime is dedicated to character study. We are asked questions about what is human, and is K really that different from actual flesh-and-blood humans. The part that stole my heart was his relationship with Joi, an AI girlfriend. I constantly think about how much of their mutual affection was computer programming, and how much was true love that somehow managed to defeat the emotional limitations of machines.
For me, the most heartbreaking part was when K is brutally confronted with the truth that he's not really the chosen child, and is merely one of millions of regular replicants.The story is strong, but there is one aspect of the movie that is even stronger - the visuals. There are two main settings throughout the movie - a neon urban jungle, and a red desert, with ruins scattered all over it. Both of these settings, as well as the minor ones, are so visually pleasing you could screenshot a random frame and make it your wallpaper.All of these aspects add up to a truly amazing picture, and if someone can appreciate a movie that isn't packed with action and thrills, they will appreciate it",10,1,5,5 May 2020
Fight Club," Amazing and unique, but often misunderstood
","Fight Club is one of the best movies ever made, and deserves all the praise. Since its release it has become a cult classic, despite flopping at the box office.The setting switches back and forth from neat IKEA-filled apartment, white office walls and button-up shirts to dark and gritty streets, blood-stained floors and destruction. Every scene is flawless, and the narration throughout the movie allows us to see the story from the main character's perspective.While the story is obviously adapted from a book, David Fincher made it his own, and improved what was already a good story. It's controversial, shocking and serves as a social commentary. You can come back to this movie many times, and find something new almost every time, thanks to numerous easter eggs hidden in it. The casting was superb, and I can't imagine anyone else playing the main characters. I never cared much about Norton, but since Fight Club he has become one of my favorites as I started appreciating his talent.Now that I talked about Norton, I have to say something about Pitt's character - Tyler Durden. The most common misunderstanding of what Fight Club is about is perceiving Tyler as a hero of the story. Obviously, Jack (I will use this name for convenience) idolizes Tyler. He's everything that Jack wishes he would be. For us, the audience, seeing Tyler as a hero isn't that hard either. He's handsome, stylish and we can't get enough of him.
There's nothing wrong with letting it all go while enjoying the movie, losing ourselves in this nihilistic world. The important thing though, is remembering that Tyler is the villain, and we should not 'let ourselves become Tyler Durden'.",10,1,1,6 May 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Surprising and entertaining in every way
","'Inglourious Basterds' is another masterpiece from Tarantino, and while it usually isn't the first movie people associate with him, it's certainly one of his best. QT plays with alternate history, introduces us to great characters and doesn't hesitate to show some blood.Let's start with the greatest member of the cast, and obviously I'm talking about Christoph Waltz. Even Tarantino himself praises his performance, and says that Waltz 'saved his movie', as he was about to scrap the whole thing unless he found the perfect Landa. It's not a surprise Waltz has since appeared in many great Hollywood movies, he's simply an amazing actor.
Obviously, other cast members do not disappoint either. Pitt as Aldo Raine is so fun to watch, as well as other Basterds. I've heard many complaints about Eli Roth's acting and his portrayal of Sgt. Donowitz, but I have to disagree. Donny is one of my favourite characters, and while Roth isn't the greatest actor in the world, he manages just fine.The plot starts out slowly, but the opening scene is arguably one of the best ever made. We get to know Hans Landa and his way of working, and we're on the edges of our seats since the very beginning, and can feel the suspense in our bodies. The story revolves around two plots, that merge into one during the ending. It's entertaining, has some comedy, a lot of drama, great dialogue and great fight sequences, and it's all peak Tarantino.It's not a typical war film, as there's not much actual war. This only works in the movie's favor, as it's something different and entirely engrossing. Definitely deserves full 10 stars",10,0,1,5 May 2020
The Irishman," Gets better with every minute
","In my opinion, 'The Irishman' has it all - great actors, great story and a great director. The beginning is tame, and maybe even boring in certain parts. And yet, with every minute the story gets better.What I like to see in a movie is how every character is important. We get to know the backstories of real-life characters portrayed in a movie, and Scorsese does a great job at showing how they're all connected, and how every single characters plays a part. In the cast we see the brightest stars in Hollywood, like Robert De Niro, as well as lesser known actors, for example Jesse Plemons. What I loved was how good Al Pacino was as Jimmy Hoffa. Many of his recent movies weren't the best ones, especially Hangman, in which the actors didn't even try to save the absolute disaster of a movie. In this one, Pacino shines as bright as in the good old days and shows he still is an excellent actor.The story itself plays smoothly and precisely, although as I mentioned earlier I was a little bored during the beginning. Fortunately, as the years pass by, everything starts to make sense. It's not easy to show such a big part of someone's life in one movie, even if it lasts 3.5 hours. It came out really well, as the story isn't rushed. I would even say it's beautiful in a way, almost magical and aesthetically pleasing. The ending is an absolute masterpiece, and it ends the story in the best possible way.It's not the best movie that came out in 2019, and probably not a one I would watch many times. Despite this, I clearly see Scorsese's genius, and without a doubt 'The Irishman' deserves at least 8 stars.",8,2,4,6 January 2020
Snatch," Simply a masterpiece
","The are Lock, Stock fans, there are Rocknrolla fans, and there are Sherlock Holmes fans. And yet, I think I won't lie when I say that most of Guy Ritchie's fans agree that Snatch is his best work. And I completely agree, this is my all time favourite and an absolute masterpiece. I can't say that Ritchie was the most diverse director during his early years, as there are many similarities to his debut movie, in almost all aspects. Despite that, the movie still feels new and original and most importantly, is highly enjoyable.We face a classic Ritchie plot - many different storylines that eventually merge into one. We follow the adventures of England's crime world, from diamond dealers to small-time crooks. At the beginning we meet Tommy and Turkish, who could be perceived as the main characters. Still, just like in 'Lock, stock and two smoking barrels', every character is important, and if you stop paying attention you might miss a scene that is a key moment in the plot.Another great thing about characters created by this ensemble cast (including Brad Pitt, Jason Statham and Benicio del Toro) is that every one of them is unique and has something to offer. In a story with so many characters, with a runtime of only 1h 45 mins, it's obvious that the screen time for every actor will be limited. And yet, we get to know a huge part of everyone's personality. Del Toro's Franky appears only in a couple of scenes, but is such a key character that without him the whole plot wouldn't make sense.I also mentioned it in my 'Lock, stock' review, but Ritchie is a master when it comes to comedy. There's humor in almost every scene, but it's dark at times, and perfectly blends with the crime and action aspect of this movie. And to balance the experience, there are dramatic moments that add to the end result.It's not a movie that will suit everyone's taste, but let's face it - such movie doesn't exist. But, if you're a fan of crime movies, action movies or comedies with a darker twist, this is the best you will get.",10,1,2,5 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A bad movie I can't help but like
","I don't know how many of you have seen Jupiter Ascending, but I love that movie and this feels exactly the same for me. And why is that? Because in my opinion Jupiter is a bad movie. And Rise of Skywalker makes me feel the exact same way. Too much rushed, unnecessary actions, too many plot twists, and sometimes the action was so ridiculous I had to pause and rethink the scene. Although I must add, the General Hux plot twist that made me laugh and cringe at the same time was unexpected. All in all, the movie is pleasant to watch, can even make me laugh or shed a tear. My favourite character, Lando, makes an appearance, Palpatine does a decent job at being himself, and of course the special effects are exquisite. I've seen worse and I will watch RoS at least once again. And yet, it doesn't say Star Wars to me, it doesn't feel like a right ending to the legendary saga - that's why I'm giving it only 6 stars. Biggest issue? The director.",6,26,74,19 December 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A mosaic of grandeur
","After watching hundreds of movies, you naturally forget some of them. This is a one almost impossible to forget, packed with adventure, comedy and drama.When I think of Wes Anderson I see colors, symmetry and visual aesthetics. Grand Budapest Hotel is Anderson's aesthetic in a nutshell, and I could watch it again with muted dialogues just to admire the scenography. All the colors add a pleasant vibe to the story but don't make it overly cartoonish.The pace is slow at first, but don't let it fool you. As the actual plot of Zero's story begins, we see chase and fight sequences so good they could be in an action movie. Not to mention the numerous themes that are present throughout the story - and there's a whole lot. Friendship, loyalty, romance but also war, nostalgia and loss.Overall, it's not a movie, it's an experience. A story that's almost never-ending, because you can watch it again and relive it, and it will feel just as good as the first time.",10,0,0,6 May 2020
Reservoir Dogs," One of the best debuts ever
","There are many directors who don't have a unique style, but Tarantino was going strong since the very beginning. Reservoir Dogs defined what he was all about, and this raw, bloody story aged like a fine wine, despite some critics' opinions.The acting is supreme, especially when we look at Mr. Blonde and Mr. White, played by Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel. But, my favourite of the cast is Tim Roth. His acting isn't flawless, and his accent is a little weak at times, but it's not about being perfect. A big part of his screentime is lying in a puddle of blood, on the verge of death, which isn't easy to pull out. Instead of just lying there, he makes use of his facial expressions and his voice, which completely sells the character.The story is quite interesting too - it's a heist movie where we don't see an actual heist. Over an hour of men talking to each other? - seems boring. But actually, it isn't. There are flashbacks, strong dialogues and scenes that hit us hard. And the opening scene? Probably one of my favourites in the history of cinema.",10,0,0,10 May 2020
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A classic from Ritchie's golden era
","This is Guy Ritchie's first feature-length movie, and it's a nearly flawless one. The premise seems quite simple, but the execution is top notch, and it's all written perfectly.In the first scenes we meet our protagonists - Bacon, Eddy, Soap and Tom. While they serve as the movie's heroes, there's an abundance of other characters, which are equally important to the story. It's important to pay attention to everything that happens on screen, because it's all connected.The movie doesn't have an all-star cast, as we may expect, but we see some very familiar names, like Sting or Jason Statham. All characters are created in a great way, with a unique personality, and there are no unimportant ones who bring nothing to the plot.Another great thing that Ritchie mastered since the very beginning is knowing exactly where to land a joke. This movie is full of dark comedy, with some characters being mainly a comedic relief, but it doesn't lose its soul. The drama is still here, as well as blood and death.The cherry on top is the ending. The choice to end it in that exact moment was the best that could be made, and the ambiguity is a fitting way for this story to end.The only thing that bothered me during the first viewing was the brown-yellowish filter applied during almost every scene. Fortunately, I soon got used to it as it's so well done it creates an illusion of it being the natural light. I think the purpose was to highlight the dirty, urban setting and if I'm correct then it does its job really well.",10,0,0,5 May 2020
Zombieland," Not all great movies have to be ambitious
","Zombieland is not the most ambitious movie. It's kinda dumb, has cliches and over-the-top characters. And I say screw that, it's a comedy and comedies are made for people to enjoy. And I enjoyed this one every single time I watched it, I still crack up at the jokes I know by heart after watching it for the 100th time.We follow the adventures of four zombie apocalypse survivors, who don't even know each other's real names - two street-smart sisters, a Twinkie-loving zombie hunter and an awkward college student. Most of the plot is purely comedy, but there's also a couple of scenes that are a little deeper, and provide a nice balance in the plot.As I said before, there are some cliches, but not only. There are things like The Rules that made their way into popculture, and are widely recognizable. It's not another stupid comedy that's instantly forgettable - don't trust the 1-star reviews. Of course, it won't be a 9-star movie for everyone, but I think many will at least see it as a decent comedy to watch on a Friday night.",9,0,0,6 May 2020
Inception," An epic and deeply engrossing story
","'Inception' has only been around for 10 years, and yet it's already considered a classic by some movie fans. Should it be? In my opinion, definitely.
Christopher Nolan is known for his movies that have a great story action-wise, and at the same time manage to hit us on a more spiritual level, and play some tricks on our minds. I think 'Inception' is his finest one, and that every person interested in modern cinema should watch it.The dream world has been shown in quite a lot of movies, but Nolan takes it to the next level. Our main characters are what we could call 'dream spies' - professionals who steal valuable information from the target's subconsciousness. Taking information from someone's brain is relatively easy, but the actual plot starts when they are asked to perform the impossible - plant an idea in the target's brain. The main characters, portrayed by Hollywood's brightest stars, fulfill all of our expectations - we root for them to succeed, and hold our breaths as their deepest secrets slowly unfold.While most of the movie's action takes place in the dream world, there are also scenes that happen in the regular world - or do they? We can never be sure what's real and what's someone's imagination. The dreams can be composed of a number of levels, and so is the story that amazes us with its layers. Nolan's directorial genius is clearly visible there, because contrary to popular belief, it's not that easy to fool the audience. Another thing that I love is one that annoys some people - an open ending. It's a simple scene, but it allows many possible explanations. It's not necessary to explain everything in your movie, and if it doesn't create any plot holes it's a great way to add some flavor to the end result.",10,0,1,5 May 2020
Trainspotting," It really hits you
","In my opinion, a movie is truly great when you keep thinking about it. No matter if your mind keeps coming back to a joke that made you laugh for hours, or a scene so sad that it almost had a physical impact on you. I keep thinking of 'Trainspotting', of almost every scene of this movie, and that's one of the reasons why it's a 10 from me.Another reason is that it all felt so real to me. I'm not Scottish myself, hell, I have never been to Scotland, and I have never set my eyes on heroin. And yet, I could sympathize with the characters' struggle, the emotions and the pain. Also, what I loved to see was that we got morally grey, or even bad protagonists. Keep in mind, protagonist doesn't mean 'good guy', it means the main character.Now, I have to talk about the main theme - drugs. Everything in this movie revolves around drugs of all kinds, and you have to be prepared for this. I have read a few reviews that condemned the movie for promoting drugs, and I don't agree with this opinion at all. I watched a lot of movies and TV shows with drugs and drug related plotlines, and yes, some of them made me think that drugs could be actually cool to try. After 'Trainspotting' I swore to myself that I will never, ever try cocaine, or heroin, or any of that crap. If someone wants to try drugs after watching this movie, I will be really surprised.There's not really a plotline during the first half, and we just follow the lives of the main characters. It's not boring though, on the contrary, it's full of feelings and angst with a sprinkle of black comedy. Later in the movie there is a plot that leads to an ending, and it's just as interesting. I think it's all resolved in a fitting way, and one that stays true to the spirit. All in all, it's an emotional roller coaster and an experience that will stay with you for a long time.",10,0,1,5 May 2020
V for Vendetta," Ideas are bulletproof
","I waited for a long time before finally seeing this movie, mainly because I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did. I watch all kinds of genres, but this rather dark, political thriller wouldn't necessarily be my first choice. The fact that it's based on a comic book convinced me to watch it, and I was amazed with it.I like a good laugh and some action in my movies, but this one sparked some different emotions. I know, V is technically a terrorist, but I just felt so inspired after watching it. I truly believed that ideas are bulletproof. Not everyone will enjoy it - my dad didn't approve of the 'leftist propaganda', but I recommend it anyways.",10,0,0,10 May 2020
