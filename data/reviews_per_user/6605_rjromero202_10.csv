Iron Man 3," Iron Man What!?
","Review on Iron Man 3: Last night I saw this movie and honestly it was not what I expected. Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, great way to start off the summer blockbusters but it was a bit off from the way the trailers and posters made the film to be out. I had high expectations for this film and I have to say they were somewhat met. Though certain scenes were funny I honestly could not believe where the film ended up at.Trust me if you go see this film it will throw you off at some point and the post credits scene funny but disappointed a lot of people so I let you be the judge of that. Overall great time seeing this film and if it is the last iron man 3 in this series, Perfect way to end an awesome trilogy.",8,9,18,26 May 2013
World War Z," Great Zombie Fun!!!
","Review on World War Z: I believe there are a handful of zombie films that do the genre justice (28 days later being one of them & a personnel favorite). With the zombie craze at a all time high there's little left to the imagination and only so many ideas can come to life. I was always interested in the world war z books but never took the time to read them regretfully, so I had high expectations for the film. I have to say I can't find anything wrong with this film. It's so thrilling that I literally was on the edge of my seat though I knew what the outcome might be. I can see the evolution of zombies from slow moving snails to rapid beasts that move at such a haste. Loved this movie and definitely will be added to my list of great zombie movies. Must see film.

Star Trek Into Darkness," This generation of Star Trek.
","Review on Star Trek Into Darkness: Now I have never been a fan of Star Trek but after I saw Star Trek (2009) film I absolutely loved it. This generation of Star Trek is incredible and yes I am of a fan of this Star Trek. So of course I was anxious to see the second installment and I have to say what an awesome movie. The visual effects were stunning, the sound was fantastic and Lets not forget the acting from Cumberbatch as khan, it was as captivating as Heath ledger's joker in The Dark Knight (2008) yes it was that good. Honestly to me this is the sleeper movie of the summer. Trust me when I say go see this film, you will enjoy it.",8,3,11,26 May 2013
Don Jon," Don Jon got a solid on
","So I decided to see Don Jon the other day before it is taken out if the theaters and honestly it was not bad. I really enjoyed the movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt is one of my favorite actors and this being his first directing film it was impressive. Great cast and editing; though I wasn't not into the whole jersey shore feel of it, but overall it's good and when you really get into the movie u can overlook that. Of course Scarlett Johansson was absolute gorgeous and fantastic in the film. A little annoy with the accent but then again it's Scarlett Johansson, and she can get away with it. I would say see it in the theaters but most likely it'll be gone so netflix for sure. RJ's Rating: 3/4 Stars.",8,7,11,9 November 2013
Man of Steel," The Realism of superman.
","Review on Man Of Steel: I've been waiting for months to see this film and it has finally arrived. From the beginning when I read that Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer was the team hired to remake superman, I was excited. I loved Snyder's adaption of Watchmen (2009) and of course admired Nolan's trilogy for The Dark Knight. So I knew that this movie was going to be epic and IT WAS! Despite what these idiotic critics say this film was incredible. They gave life to this realistic superman. They showed more of the man and what it meant for him to grow into his human side. Though the beginning of the film did move at a fast paced, it was all worth the rush with what the action sequences brought and they were mind blowing, powerful fights. Kevin Costner and Michael Shannon gave great performances worth watching. Amy Adams version of Lois Lane was at its best and as for Henry Cavill, he is this generations superman and should be right there next to Christopher Reeve. This movie to me is the movie of the year hands down. A must see film. RJ's Rating: 3 & 1/2 Stars",9,4,8,14 June 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Most ambitious comic book film of all time.
","Let start off by saying I enjoyed this film. Yes it's not a great film but it's not the worst either. It's a decent film. To me it's good. Now that I said that let me give more details into my rating for this film. Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice is one of the most ambitious comic book film I've seen since Watchmen. Unfortunately it comes up short on my expectations, as I'm sure does the same with yours, but still doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy it. I did not like the way this film was edited, Zack Snyder tried the same editing style he did in Watchmen with BVS but doesn't work out well. The story could've been more powerful but it lacks substance. The holes in the story also make it distracting to want to continue following and the Easter eggs and foreshadowing are exciting but if you are not a DC fan it will be hard to follow and understand. The positives of this film, of course the CGI is incredible, the settings are breathtaking and the acting was on point. Very well acted from a great cast. The action sequences are amazing and thrilling. The runtime could've been cut down a bit but I never found my self bored at all. I was always interested on what is coming next around the corner. Ben Affleck is one of or the best batman I've seen. He steals my attention every time he's on screen. Henry Cavill took a step up from Man Of Steel and took superman to another level. Gal Gadot was mysterious and showed potential to be a lead in her solo movie. Jesse Eisenberg, well to me be was fantastic, played a very energetic psycho bent on the destruction of superman. Very exciting to watch him on screen. This film is very complex and will be up for debate for years to come. I believe with the release of the other DC films, will help people understand this film a lot more better. RJ's Rating: 7/10.",7,3,6,30 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," There has been an awakening, we all have felt it.
","Let me start off by saying, fan boys are going to complain and cry about anything little thing, don't pay mind to them and judge a film by your own accord. Now with that out of my system, Star Wars was a great, great film. My real only issue with the film is that the main story line is pretty much a replica of New Hope, but the character development was entertaining, the action was thrilling, and settings were fantastic. I don't understand the dislike of Kylo Ren, he was one of my favorite characters and Adam Driver gave a great performance of a weird yet powerful young dark figure dealing with issues as self hate and a battle within himself between light and dark. Rey has so much potential that I feel in part 8 she will excel more. Finn also, his comedic performance was fun. A nice surprise was from Domhnall Geeson as general Hux, I don't know but every time he was on screen the attention was quickly drawn to him. Could also say he was a screen stealer as his performance was captivity. Would've loved to see more from Oscar Isaac but I guess in part 8, and of course the old cast of Leia and Han were great to see back in action, they didn't miss a step. Overall a really fantastic film for a whole generation of Star Wars fans, young and old. RJ's Rating: 8/10",8,3,30,31 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Catching fire has sparked the franchise.
","Well the sequel to the hunger games franchise has arrived (Catching Fire) into theaters, and I have to say it is good. Though this film drags and I do mean drraagg along in the beginning, it does lead up to a climatic moment that does give some chills. It surpasses it's predecessor with more of a emotional roller coaster and mental madness that the world of hunger games presents. It did represent the book more than the first film did but still missed a few key points that I felt should've been put in. I love the creative of the challenges and how it affected everyone in the games and most of all I love Jennifer Lawrence performance. Definitely a movie you should see in the theaters and if it's not your cup of tea Netflix hands down. RJ's Rating: 3/4 stars.",8,0,15,26 November 2013
The Hangover Part III," Not the right end to this trilogy
","Since the first hangover (2009) came out I thought it was one of the funniest films I've seen in a decade. Part II (2011) was released and I thought the film was OK I found some parts funny but the story was too repetitive. Since the announcement of the third and final film (hopefully) I had no interest in it but because of my curiosity to see what becomes of the wolf pack it won me over. I'm glad to see the film makers take a different approach so it won't be an exact copy of part one but because of the new approach there were no laugh out loud moments, just a few cheap chuckles. Other then Allen & Chow performances and the only ones in the film that were funny, the movie just dragged along. Showing nothing interesting in the film what so ever. I guess because of the new elements they took that's why it wasn't at its best nor funniest but they could've done a complete better job with their jokes. I recommend this film to be seen on Netflix at best. RJ's Rating: 1 & 1/2",6,0,1,12 June 2013
The Great Gatsby," The 'Good' Gatsby
","Review on The Great Gatsby: The other day when I went to see this film I had high expectations. Past couple of months they have built such a hype that I fell for it. Well it was visually dazzling as one might expect. Once again no need for the 3-D experience as i saw none. The film did move at a fast paced and at times could lose the audience at what is happening, not to mention didn't really give that time to connect with the characters which is crazy as its a 2 1/2 hour movie. The characters though were interesting to watch as the film did catch that essence the book did when reading. Leonardo Dicaprio did a great job and stole the show (which he always seem to do) but in my opinion it was more Carey mulligan who shine more then everyone else. Overall great film for the summer, did give me that same thrill from when i saw moulin rouge ( same directer for both films) years back.",8,4,9,26 May 2013
