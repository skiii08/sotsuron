Black Swan," What the art of filmmaking is truly about
","After I watch a film of true vision, I feel as if I want to cry, out of inspiration, respect, and absolute appreciation.I wanted to cry after Black Swan.Darren Aronofsky has created a chilling masterpiece that should set the bar not only for psychological thrillers, but for all artistic movies for years to come. My heart has never pounded harder during a movie from the tumult of sheer, dark intensity. Genius in development, writing, music, cinematography, and especially acting, Black Swan and its cast and crew may very well deserve every award it is nominated for.Giving away any more details than that would be a huge disservice to both viewers and the movie, so my only advice is to get in the theater some way or another and watch it. A near 'perfect' film in every way, Black Swan is perhaps the star of 2010 and not a movie you should miss. 10/10",10,9,18,17 December 2010
127 Hours," It makes a better story than it does a movie
","127 Hours, as its title suggests, recounts the 127 hours that hiker and rock climber Aron Ralston spends stranded in a slot canyon, based on recounts of the true story in Ralston's best-selling memoir 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place'. After an accident with a loose rock, Ralston stumbles into a crevice and ultimately lands with his right arm wedged tightly between the rock and the canyon wall. As the days pass by, Ralston runs low on water, uses up his food, and his efforts at chipping away at the rock with a dull knife seem to be in vain. The only thing that keeps him going are promises he made to his family and the hope that he would one day see his loved ones again.As you can imagine, this movie is as much director Danny Boyle's as it is James Franco's. When nearly all of the film's 94 minutes consist of Franco's psychological turmoil, his acting has to carry the movie, and as expected, Franco pulls it off very nicely. Expect some terrific and believable acting as Ralston struggles not only to free himself from the rocky prison, but also to come to terms with personal mistakes he made earlier in his life. However, 127 Hours may unwittingly fall into the category of 'psychological thriller', and with such a genre comes some strong expectations: intense scriptwriting and extraordinary acting. While the film may not necessarily be a 'thriller' because it purposely recounts the real-life story of Aron Ralston, it still falls victim to its requirements; and this is where we see a disappointment in the movie. Nothing is missing from the acting side, but the script is regular, rather boring, and predictable. We know Ralston is still alive, we know he suffered, we know some parts were gritty- but no flourish is added to the original story to make it interesting. Everything is straightforward- no twists. 127 Hours wishes itself to be more engaging than it actually is. Still, it stays close to the facts of the book, which leads me to the conclusion that Ralston's tale makes a better story than it does a movie (and that psychological thrillers may not be Boyle's strong suit).James Franco puts out a terrific role in this movie, but aside from his performance you can't expect anything too out-of-the-ordinary or impressive. 6/10",6,15,29,18 November 2010
Horrible Bosses," A fun and creative comedy, but a lot of wasted potential!
","Horrible Bosses hits the road running and starts right off with an interesting (and perhaps relatable) scenario. Three average Joe's decide they've had enough of their psychotic, incompetent, and nymphomaniacal bosses and seek out a hit-man to relieve them of their headaches. However, things go awry and the plan instead transforms into a Hitchcockian scheme to murder one another's bosses.As a comedy, Horrible Bosses really shines. The plot alone is a breath of fresh air, and when the jokes start rolling they don't let up. The film turned out to be a seamless flow of clever and engaging hilarity.The major disappointment was on the part of the boss characters. For goodness sakes, if you manage to nab Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston as your antagonists, you should award them with plenty of juicy, villainous screen time. Unfortunately that doesn't really happen, and it's a shameful waste of potential. For a comedy like this, the bosses were sufficiently shocking, but their characters were not as fleshed out as I would have liked to see. Still, don't let that discourage your interest in Horrible Bosses â€“ it is guaranteed to entertain!7/10",7,7,14,6 July 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," The Star of Summer 2011 Missed it By that Much
","By all accounts, Captain America: The First Avenger should have stolen the spotlight for all of 2011. The special effects consisted of easily the most impressive batch of explosions, gunfights, and fantastical vehicles so far this year. There were no complaints in the acting department: Chris Evans was born to play the Captain and was strongly supported on each side by the talents of Hayley Atwell as the gorgeous Peggy Carter and veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Phillips. And as well all know, Hugo Weaving, perfectly capable of delivering the most dreadful of villains, had his shot at the infamous Johann Schmidt (or Red Skull). Adopting one of the most classic American stories of our time, and across the fascinating historical backdrop of WWII, this film had all the elements perfectly aligned and was geared to set the bar for all superhero movies to come. Don't get me wrong, Captain America: The First Avenger was solid in almost every aspect and incredibly entertaining, but a groundbreaking superhero film it is not. What went wrong? Warning: Criticism and minor spoilers lie ahead!Film adaptations of comic books are notorious in their development of the superhero. In many cases the film waits until its latter half before fully empowering protagonist, and the confrontations with the villain are squeezed into a rushed conclusion. Captain America actually reverses this timing decision, and Steve Rogers' transformation into the American hero is one of the first events that happens in the movie. But the remainder of the film STILL manages to feel miserably rushed. Superheroes are typically given a couple chances to gain a command over their powers; they practice, experiment, and sometimes even fail, but the hero is developed as a result of the learning process, not instantaneously established. Captain America is at fault here. The moment a relatively inexperienced Captain America decides to leap past enemy lines he immediately, and miraculously, becomes a human wrecking ball, knocking away everything in his path from Nazis to high-tech tanks. In fact, all of his 'missions' to destroy the enemy bases - except the first and last - are shown within one frustratingly short montage full only of Captain America glory shots. Montages can work, when timed correctly, but Captain America utterly fails to build up to this sequence - Steve Rogers is simply thrown into the fray... and wins. Another major miss can be attributed to the character of Johann Schmidt. In my humble personal opinion, a superhero movie can only be as good as its villain. Apparently the writers did not share my sentiments, because Hugo Weaving was awarded a criminally small amount of screen time. Weaving gave a good effort but was unfortunately not given much to work with. The most 'evil' the Red Skull gets is expressed through a couple angry snarls and intentional friendly fire during the action montage. However, the most impacting flaw was the film's conclusion. I won't say exactly what the ending entails, but I will say it is frustratingly ironic. After a sudden and abrupt cut in the action, instead of wrapping up any of the romantic or historical plots of the movie - in fact, instead of wrapping up ANY part of the movie - it suddenly shifts to a drastically different setting in order to set up the future 'The Avengers' film. Whether or not The Avengers will take care of the loose ties remains to be seen. It seemed like a tragedy that the original story was not concluded at all to my satisfaction, but when I remembered the full title of the movie I chided myself for expecting anything different.I left the theater feeling a bit divided over what my opinion of the film should be. On one hand it was an improved Marvel work that everyone seemed to enjoy, but on the other hand it betrayed my expectations for the 10-star superhero masterpiece I had imagined. In the end, I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt; while it still has flaws, Captain America: The First Avenger may still come out on top of the Marvel pile. 8/10",7,5,21,21 July 2011
Watchmen," Watchmen
","Let me say this before I begin. Alan Moore's graphic novel was monumental and spectacular. I am a fan of the graphic novel myself, so don't take me wrong when I say that I believed it was possible for Zach Snyder to overtake Alan Moore's original work. Now, did he? Not quite. Let's see why (this is intended for people who have previously read Watchmen) : The Story- Oh, the plot. This is where fan boys and Watchmen geeks start feeling antsy. It's true that many small scenes and alternate story lines were removed in order to correctly adjust to the feel of the movie. The Tales of the Black Freighter, mainly, was the most unfortunate loss in this process, but with a movie length already in arm's reach of three hours, it's understandable why this aspect of Watchmen was taken out. Besides, it will be featured on a spin-off DVD. Aside from that, the details from that book that were removed were, in retrospect, too minor to cause a significant disturbance to the movie. There simply isn't enough lost content for fan boys to be up in arms. So yes, I'll say it: Snyder removed what he deemed was 'unnecessary' to the core of the plot, and he pulled it off! In fact, while I was watching the film I hardly noticed the deleted content at all. It was only until I began pondering the movie after I had seen it when I realized that certain scenes had been left out at all. The movie was so intensely captivating that the thought never crossed my mind the whole while that my eyes were glued to the screen. It's amazing how much of the film ended up looking exactly alike to the novel. The ending, however, had some major revisions! Oh, the HORROR! Come on. They took out the giant, psychic, alien squid. Big deal. Can you honestly say that after reading the graphic novel ending, you weren't thinking, 'What the hell? Really?' Eventually, the idea of alien squids settled in our minds, and we convinced ourselves that it created a satisfactory ending. Well, guess what? You can still achieve the same effect with the ending Snyder concocted. The idea of using Dr. Manhattan's power instead of alien squids is a bit less far-fetched and much more comforting to our common sense. Honestly, it's not as major a change as critics make it out to be. Don't call me a heretic, but I may just have liked Snyder's ending little more The Characters/Actors- Well here's something I didn't expect. After being blown away by Heath Ledger's joker in Dark Knight, what can you expect from actors in a super hero movie? I didn't expect much from Matthew Goode or Malin Akerman. But I was wrong. Matthew Goode, though tweaking the appearance of the original Ozymandias, performed wonderfully. His acting was a bit out of place in a few scenes, but nothing that might make it anything worse than awkward. Goode's build may not match that of a ridiculously muscular superhuman, but it is not a noticeable of a defect. He was a little feminine though well, I won't go there. Crudup was fine, but his normal human voice was far too soft to personify an immortal like Dr. Manhattan. Oh, and thanks for the big, blue penis. Appreciate that. Very faithful to the novel. On a different note, Patrick Wilson and Haley were absolutely stunning; it's impossible to use words to describe how well they fit their characters, so I won't try. The only weakness, maybe, was Malin Akerman's performance. MAYBE. She exceeded my expectations, no doubt. She was good enough, but not great. The Comedian was portrayed just as well as anyone else by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Overall, it was a strong, well-put together cast. Oh, and Nixon's ridiculously enlarged nose was actually accurate, just in case you were wonderingVisual Effects- Damn. I mean, how do you top the stuff Snyder throws at his audience, especially with the budget he had? Effects were simply spectacular; no doubt about it. This is perhaps the strongest aspect of the movie. I expected nothing less (however, I did cringe slightly in a couple scenes involving Archy and Dr. Manhattan, in which the CGI did not seem very realistic). GORE! Be forewarned! BLOOD, GUTS, GORE! There, I warned you. Aside from the occasional glowing penis, the most shocking parts came from the most satisfyingly violent scenes. The fighting was magnificent! Nostalgia took over during the hand-to-hand combat scenes as I was reminded of martial arts fights immortalized in The Matrix. Then fascination took over as I watched the scenes explode with action and enter a whole new level of awesomeness. So, overall? I proudly award Watchmen with a well-deserved 9/10. For being an 'un-filmable' graphic novel, Snyder certain created a good movie. I still am reeling over the entire thing. Whoa, what just happened!? Watchmen happened. Snyder, his cast, his crew, and all you loyal fans made it happen. They truly made the Watchmen come to life. Bravo! So next time you hear a grumpy critic rave about how Watchmen fell short or read a harsh criticism of the movie, you know they've caught Alan Moore-ism. Yes, with a nasty attitude like Alan Moore's that refuses to even give the Watchmen movie a chance to live up to the novel, it stands no chance in the mind of the public. While I respect Moore's point of view, I still disapprove of his intolerant attitude. Why is it impossible to create a film adaptation of a graphic novel and not miss out on the big picture? I believe once Watchmen spreads and grows exponentially in popularity, then the Alan Moore's of the world will truly be the ones missing out.",8,1,6,6 March 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A big improvement in the series!
","In my mind, the Deathly Hallows Part 1 captured the feeling of exactly what the Harry Potter movies should have been all along: gritty, emotional, and cinematic. I haven't been a huge fan of any of the HP movies to date, but I was pleased with the Deathly Hallows because it took a big step up in maturity from the 'children's fantasy' genre and focused on themes very central to the seventh book: hopelessness and desperation. After the death of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, the magical world falls into disarray as Voldemort gains power over the Ministry of Magic and hunts tirelessly after his mortal enemy and our continuing protagonist, Harry Potter. While keeping a low cover, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine decide to track down and destroy Voldemort's soul contained in hidden 'horcruxes' but have difficulties deciding what to do and where to start.The Deathly Hallows very successfully portrays the despair-filled journey of the wizarding trio. With dark undertones running through the cinematography, Part 1 of the Harry Potter finale is the film that deals more with the emotional stagnation of the characters and spends less time with action scenes and major plot points. Since Rowling's seventh book is separated into two movies, Part 1 boasts a much slower pace than earlier HP films and is not so focused on cramming as many subplots and side-stories from the book as possible into the movie's runtime, which tends to clutter up the storyline and make the whole thing feel rushed. But where the slow pacing makes this film stand out in the series, it also may be its downfall. The Deathly Hallows continually feeds us a feeling of desolation as Harry, Ron and Hermoine fail to discover a way to destroy the horcruxes; they seem to be making no progress towards defeating the Dark Lord, but as an effect the movie seems to be making no progress towards an ending. Storyline lags intensely towards the middle of the film and is dragged out until the conclusion (which ends abruptly). You'll be left in your seats feeling like this is going nowhere- but that's the point: Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are getting nowhere. So I liked this movie because the pace was slow, but I also didn't like this movie because the pace was slow. See what I'm getting at? Aside from that, I can't complain much. Performances were fine, effects were impressive, and best of all, nothing dastardly was done to J.K. Rowling's story.The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a nice improvement and a fine addition to the Harry Potter series and should serve as a solid emotional base for Part 2 to take off with next year. If you've enjoyed the HP movies so far, this should be a satisfying experience at least. If not, let the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 redeem your faith in the series. 7/10P.S. Keep on the lookout for the scene about the deathly hallows story. It has some of the most beautiful and artistic animation I have ever seen in a movie.",7,130,214,15 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Packs twice the punch, in every way!
","Let me preface by saying I was rather unimpressed with the first Kung Fu Panda. As entertaining and well-choreographed as it was, it didn't pass my bar for mediocre DreamWorks animated movies. It was amusing and had some heart, but all-in-all was pretty expected. Now when I got a chance to see a preview of Kung Fu Panda 2, I was rather indifferent to seeing DreamWorks trying to pump out a mediocre sequel and a new franchise. But WOW... was I wrong! I take back everything I said earlier because, man oh man, I have to admit that Kung Fu Panda 2 was one of the best animated films I have ever seen.In in this installment, we find Po and the Furious Five defending the Valley of Peace from evil when a new threat rises. Lord Shen, an albino peacock banished by his parents many years ago, has returned with a technology capable of ending kung fu and conquering China. As the Furious Five embark to destroy the weapon, Po begins to realize that Shen may be linked to his lost childhood past as a panda bear. I won't say any more in fear of spoiling the story, but be prepared for a powerful emotional experience.I found a big improvement was that they toned down all the things that made the first movie irritating: over-the-top Jack Black antics, overused slow-mo effects, and dialogue silliness. That's not to say Kung Fu Panda 2 doesn't have humor; actually, it has exactly the right amount at the right time. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot at the jokes in the first movie, but the sequel had me (and the whole theater, for that matter) genuinely laughing! The characters have fully matured and been fleshed out to the point where even Jack Black fits comfortably as Po, though regrettably the Furious Five barely get any screen time. Of course, shining in the spotlight was Gary Oldman as the sinister Lord Shen, whose fantastically evil voice acting tops even Ian McShane's as Tai Lung and is the ONLY way that a peacock could possibly be made scary! The 3D was also showcased quite well, enhancing most of the visuals throughout the movie without being a headache.Maybe you call it blasphemy, but the comparison must be made. Kung Fu Panda 2 was put together with such a degree of excellence that it rivals many Pixar movies (and in my opinion has a good chance of outshining Cars 2 this year). With some fantastic animation, a surprising and touching story, and convincing voice talent, Kung Fu Panda 2 will easily go down as one of my all-time animated favorites.9/10",9,97,147,22 May 2011
Warrior," Emotions on par with The Fighter, one of the top combat sport movies since Rocky, one of the best of 2011
","Every so often you'll come across a combat sport movie that manages to find just the right balance of drama and action â€“ that is, more drama than action. When fights are justified with backstories full of crushing emotion, they become all the more intense and gratifying. Warrior brings to the table the world of mixed martial arts, where punches, kicks, holds, and everything else goes. The inception of new international tournament 'Sparta' puts on a collision course Paddy (Nick Nolte), Brendan (Joel Edgerton), and Tom Conlon (Tom Hardy), all part of an estranged family torn apart in the past by abuse, favoritism, and abandonment. Tom resurfaces in society to enlist the help of his formerly alcoholic father Paddy to train him for the tournament, while at the same time Brendan revisits his UFC training in hopes to win the $5 million purse for his struggling family. The two underdogs face some of the toughest MMA fighters on the planet, but the true struggle appears to lie within them. Paddy battles for forgiveness against the resentment of his sons, Tom fights to prove to himself that he is strong, and Brendan struggles to come to terms with his older family while trying to support one of his own.The fantastic thing here is two protagonists entering the same tournament. Each brother has his own respectable reasons for fighting, a fact that is sure to divide the audience when it comes time to choose which one to root for. The story truly is gut-wrenchingly powerful and presented in an engaging fashion. Little by little through the film's dialogue, we are allowed a glimpse into the past hardships of the Conlon family, and the characters' motivations for retaining such hatred are revealed gradually. Through the incredible acting talents of Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte, this confused and passionate chemistry really comes alive. All three actors put up some of the most convincing and heartbreaking performances of their careers; and seeing as how The Fighter garnered so many Oscar nominations, I can't see why Warrior will not do the same. My only beef with the movie is its clichÃ©d climax and rather bleak inconclusive ending, though it still does good to the emotional schism the movie intended to create. Warrior is one of those sports films with a magical mixture of emotional and physical battle. It's a wonderful story showing how sometimes the world's strongest forces are insignificant in comparison to the troubles of a scarred family. Warrior is without a doubt worth a visit to the theater. One of the best of 2011! And whether you're an MMA fan or not, the adrenaline-pumping fights will have you up and cheering and applauding.9/10",9,284,361,31 July 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," There's never been a movie quite like Scott Pilgrim before... and there may be a reason for that
","Scott Pilgrim is a normal boy living in Toronto, recovering from a devastating breakup by bouncing off of a high school Chinese girl, when suddenly he becomes captivated by the newbie in town, Ramona Flowers. However, after he suddenly discovers the league of seven evil exes set on controlling Ramona's future, their love lives become tangled, convoluted, and everything gets messy.The first thing you'll notice in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is its incredibly unique style. There's never exactly been a movie like this in the past, and with a visionary like Edgar Wright at the helm, that is nothing to be ashamed of. The movie is entirely based off of the 'Scott Pilgrim' graphic novel series; but wherein this is the film's greatest feature, it is also its greatest weakness. It's based off the comics- you can tell. And not necessarily in a good way.Edgar Wright has achieved a fantastic way to bring a comic book to life. If you've really been searching for a live-action, 3D, moving version of a comic book then you'll want to pat him on the back. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World gets as close to bringing the 'graphic novel' style to the big screen as Speed Racer was in successfully bringing the 'anime' style to the theaters, which in my opinion is pretty darn close. Scott Pilgrim fans will get a kick out of this one; the film pays homage to the graphic novel in more ways than one. The problem is, you're fitting multiple volumes of this series into a 112 minute movie. The characterization is rushed, the relationships are sorely underdeveloped, a load of character history is barely (if even) explained, and you can't shake the 'there's-more-to-this-story-than-they're-telling-us' feeling that only the hardcore Pilgrim fans are probably exempt from.The acting was solid, the humor was definitely a strong point, but the tendency for the storyline to feel rushed often got in the way of fully enjoying this movie. All-in-all, it WAS a fun flick to say the least; it just wasn't all there.If you're looking for another round of Michael Cera jokes and an intriguing comic book-style, then by all means check this one out. If that doesn't float your boat, then don't bother. Although style is a strong suit here, sometimes it teeters on the brink of being bizarre and immature. Re-watch the trailer- that will be enough 'style' to suffice for one night.6/10",6,10,37,4 August 2010
Friends with Benefits," Leave it to Justin and Mila to make a better 'No Strings Attached'
","So is Friends With Benefits better than No Strings Attached? Yes. And if that's all you needed to settle a bet with your friend, you can go call him up now and plan a trip to the theater July 22 to find out why.Justin Timberlake has proved once again that he can actually act... Pretty well, actually. And that automatically puts him lightyears ahead of Ashton Kutcher. Additionally, Justin and Mila have some excellent and convincing chemistry that really supports the film, along with a handful of jokes and hilarious cameos that make for some good laughs. But the story falls flat where it tries to parody the typical romance movie because ultimately, it adheres to the exact same chick-flick formula: Guy meets girl, they hit it off, complications arise, they fall apart, they resolve their issues, and voilÃ ... happily ever after. And Mila's mother in the movie... where have we seen her character before? Oh that's right, literally copy+pasted from Easy A. I suppose you probably wouldn't expect anything more out of this movie than the run-of-the-mill romance comedy, but it's a solid one at that and worth your while if you're interested! 7/10",7,27,51,16 June 2011
Super 8," J.J. Abrams does it again!
","As you might expect, J. J. Abrams has churned out another exhilarating experience with solid entertainment. Imagine, if you will, a combination of The Goonies + Cloverfield and you will get Super 8, the story of a young boy and his friends that witness a creature escaping a crashed military train while filming with a super 8 camera. As I heard an audience member say after the screening, J. J. Abrams put his fingerprint on this movie, then smeared it all over. The mysterious creature is only glimpsed a handful of times during the first half of the film, and the story will keep you constantly guessing and engaged. With the aid of some fantastic special effects, Super 8 will no doubt be one of the most exciting films of this summer, additionally offering a nostalgic reminder of the times of Spielberg's E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. So the bottom line is: Super 8 is good, and if you're watching it as a J. J. Abrams fan, you're in for a real treat.But the film is not without its flaws. Within this young cast you can sense a lot of rising starsÂ… but that's just it. They're still 'rising'. It is a common problem to have some amateur acting with kids. The story is not entirely original either. However, these are only minor complaints against the movie. The main issue with Super 8 is that it can't decide what it wants to be. Is it a coming-of-age drama? Is it an alien action film? Is it horror mystery? Alien and horror and mystery genres can mix quite nicely, but unfortunately coming-of-ageÂ… not so much. One aspect of the film focuses on the adventure of kids in a rural town while another focuses on a violently rampaging alien. The result is a schizophrenic jumble of genres that has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat at the idea of kids watching certain scenes. For this reason, I STRONGLY caution adults taking their kids to see this movie. Super 8 had more blood, cursing, and blatant drug references than any movie I have seen in a while. IT's a bit like walking into Kick-ass expecting a child's movie. In my honest opinion Super 8 should have been rated R, but Abrams was careful when pushing the limits of PG-13 rules. Indeed, this movie was a wonderful throwback to the days of E.T., but perhaps should only be viewed by those who watched E.T. when it came out. Don't forget that the Abrams touch is violent, as well as mysterious! 8/10",8,4,12,8 June 2011
Rango," Nickelodeon bares its fangs
","So a slight blurb about how surprised I was that Nickelodeon was tackling several mature themes: Rango boasted quite a number of darker undertones that you wouldn't normally expect from a PG, animated Nickelodeon movie. Such areas included language (sporting such lines as 'You son of a-'!, 'Go to hell!', and 'Can I gut-shoot someone?'), violence (an impressive amount of shooting and dying), sexual themes (making references to how 'active' one's mother was and a joke about a mammogram), and the film's portrayal of death (where characters constantly expect Rango's death and at one point, parody death by hanging). That is, you could arguably find just as much material in other animated films, such as The Incredibles- but it just goes to show that Nickelodeon is ready to experiment with a braver sort of film, much like Disney did with Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay, disclaimer over. Rango is beautiful film that, regardless of its content, gave everyone in the theater a darn good time. Borrowing heavily from classic Westerns (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) and Western comedies (The Three Amigos), the film brings reinvents a past formula in an amusingly creative way. Rango, a pet chameleon unsure about how he wants his identity to develop, is suddenly cast to into the life of the wild wild west and decides to assume the duties of the sheriff in a troubled town. When the gunslingin' enemies arrive, the trouble begins...If anything, the film is revolutionary in its animation. The quality and textures of the animals and landscape is simply spot-on and never ceases to amaze. By far this is the movie's greatest strength- and supporting the beautiful visuals is a whole slew of jokes. Like I said before, sometimes the humor is a bit awkward for its targeted audience (there were definitely a lot of times adults laughed instead of the kids) but for the most part the theater as a whole enjoyed the comedic spots. The voice acting cast is of course lively and fun, bringing a unique quality to each and every animal character. And lastly, the score by Hans Zimmer is once again majestic and exciting (influences from his work in Pirates and Sherlock Holmes are easily heard, but with a Mexican twist!).Overall, Rango is a beautiful and exciting western adventure that you shouldn't miss! As long as you know what you're in for, the humor and the visuals will take you for an unforgettably pleasing ride. 8/10",8,80,113,2 March 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A Magical End to an Incredible Saga
","I salute you, Potter fans. This moment has taken 10 years to find you, and now the wait is finally over. I can tell you the wait was worth it. Maybe you want to know exactly what happens to Voldemort in the movie or exactly how a battle specifically goes down, but spoilers for this movie (good or bad) are simply not worth knowing. Get in line and don't ruin the experience for yourself.I know what your big (generic) questions are... Is Part 2 fantastically more epic than the previous films? Does it loyally mirror the book to the very last page? Has Daniel Radcliffe's acting improved? I know you definitely don't want to hear it, and I definitely don't want to say it, but the answer is No. If you have come this far after watching seven Harry Potter movies and still have no clue what to expect, then I don't know what to tell you. In whatever regard you held Part 1, you will probably think similarly of Part 2. They are made of the same quality,,, Unfortunately, that means I can guarantee there will be moments that cause you to shift uncomfortably in your seat and think to yourself, 'That's not how it happened in the book'; you'll see chunks of the story removed for the sake of runtime; some parts, namely the romances, will feel rushed and awkward; what consisted of pages of dialogue in the book are awarded a single line in the movie; the smothering relationship with Hollywood style leads to silly fist fights and corny one-liners. Even the epilogue is quite laughable because someone in the costume department thought '19 years later' only meant '19 pies and a Big Mac later'. Again, these are all defects you should have come to expect in the series... But do not despair! I can also guarantee that after these fleeting mistakes pass, you will shrug your shoulders and realize that these are Harry's last days. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 is perhaps the only possible movie that, despite however unsatisfying some scenes might be, the film as a whole will leave you with a grand sense of fulfillment in your mind and with a feeling of nostalgic happiness tugging at your heartstrings. You will STILL be rooting for your favorite heroes, be wow-ed by excellent special effects, and squirm with delight at the sight of the long-awaited kiss. It is ultimately a bombastic conclusion befitting of one of the greatest literary and film series in history - No one can argue with that. Harry Potter's life on the screen may be over, but the boy who lived will continue to live in our hearts forever.",7,3,9,12 July 2011
