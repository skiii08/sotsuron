Frost_Nixon," Some fine acting in a movie that is at times uneven
","Not a very deep view of American politics but that's Ron Howard for you. I question his view of history sometimes especially after the liberties he took with A Beautiful Mind. Apparently the part with Nixon drunk dialing frost was fictional. The acting was good but not excellent. I liked the supporting cast of Rockwell and Platt. I didn't care much for Kevin Bacon who I thought was over-the-top in his Nixon foot soldier character who will defend the President to every end.I'm not sure if this kind of material is really suited to Ron Howard though. I don't think his direction always has the depth for this kind of political topic. One scene showed Nixon petting a dog just after he'd been pummeled in an interview by Frost. The scene practically cries out 'See, he *is* human'. This is what I don't like about Ron Howard.Overall though the movie was good but nowhere near perfect. It may be better suited as a play. A lot of the scenes around the interviews themselves are drawn out and not fully necessary.",Null,2,6,14 December 2008
3:10 to Yuma," Plot holes and clich√©s abound
","There's so many plot holes in this movie that the whole movie quickly becomes unbelievable. The story involves a rancher (Bale) who needs money and takes a job transporting a dangerous killer (Crowe) by horseback. The killer eventually gets loose and starts killing people but Christian Bale and co. keep re-capturing him although Crowe's character does get loose again and kills another one of his captors. This goes on for an unbelievably long time. What's really unbelievable is that Crowe's captors never think of shooting him. There wouldn't be much a movie if this happened but the entire movie is based on a rather ridiculous premise.Ben Foster's character is also annoying and completely rubbed me the wrong way. He's unconvincing as a vile little toadie to Crowe. The audience is mostly reminded again and again of how bad Foster's character is. Not just bad, bad-ass. Foster is a capable actor but he's completely out of place here. Where he was good was in 'Six Feet Under' as a secondary character in an art school where he played a jealous, mentally ill art school student. He was more convincing in that. His 5'7 scrawny tough-guy persona is unintentionally funny at best.",Null,0,2,3 July 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Not so glorious violence
","The first half of this movie was quite good. It was interesting and suspenseful. The second half was pretty bad. The comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic Nazi characters and some badly acted 'good guys' blowing them away. There's a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not squeamish about violence but I think it should at least have some purpose in a movie. There was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles. We're somehow supposed to be amused by this.I watched Reservoir Dogs recently. There was a movie where violence was employed effectively. It was realistic within the world the movie created. There were never any over-the-top sound effect. It was a crime movie which played it straight. Inglorious Basterds should have played it straight but didn't. I was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face.None of the back-story of any of the Basterds is really explained either, they're simply Nazi hunters. We don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face. It's all about 'revenge' and very little else.There was 2 1/2 hours to work with here but few of the Basterds were really examined in depth. This seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple. We saw that in Tarantino's last flick, 'Death Proof' which I didn't care for either. It suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable.The first half again, was pretty good. I wanted to see the exploits of the Inglorious Basterds across Europe. I was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book Nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in France.",Null,18,34,18 November 2009
Public Enemies," Depp's shootout
","Johnny Depp is very capable in the role of John Dillinger. He's a great actor, but besides Depp and a fine supporting role by Bale, there's not all that much which is great about the acting in this movie. The movie feels very conventional to me. It's good but it's never special. This is not to say the movie doesn't have good point. The set pieces are all very top notch as well. This is a very good movie to look at, everything looks authentic 1930s.But there have been movies like this before, movies about convicts on the loose with lots of firepower and a hatred of the police, Bonnie & Clyde is one excellent movie about this topic. It's similarly based on a true story although there is a lot of artistic license being used.I never felt that kind of excitement in Public Enemies. There's lots of shooting but that seems to have taken the precedent over any character development.I would have liked to get to know Christian Bale's character more as well as some of the other officers in the then newly created FBI trying to catch Dillinger. Dillinger's comrades also seem to get a once over.Depp is good as always and it's nice to see him in a different kind of role for him (something outside of a Tim Burton film) but the story felt like it could have been a lot better. We've all seen shootouts captured on screen before but this movie should have been more about the characters than their actions.",Null,1,3,11 December 2009
500 Days of Summer," Quirky indie comedy is quirky!
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a mopey man in his early twenties, working a soulless job at a greeting card company. His life is pretty meaningless until he meets Zooey Deschanel. They share an affinity for The Smiths. They do zany things like pretend that Ikea is their personal living room and generally flirt with each other.It's a pretty good film overall, I was quite surprised I liked this. The writing was pretty sharp and Deschanel who is usually pretty annoying seemed to be a little more restrained in this movie. Gordon-Levitt is good as well. These are probably the types of movies he should be making instead of crap like Killshot where he was almost laughable as a petty criminal.Maybe this the movie which epitomizes everyone's early 20s or at least their post-university life. You want to tell Gordon-Levitt to stop being so damn mopey in this movie but there's really no hope, you know everyone has to go through something like this and he plays the role pretty well in this movie.The Graduate features prominently in the movie and with good reason because this movie is somewhat similar to that one. It also dealt with a mopey man out of college falling in love with the wrong girl. I could have done without some of the more pretentious overtones such as the narration which reminded me of One Week, a film I just recently saw about a young guy trying to find out who he is.",Null,0,2,12 December 2009
Once," Bad music + bad acting + bad film-making = bad movie
","Another entry in the 'indie chic' category of bad film making. This movie was really too hip for its own good. It was all shot on digital camera and it's usually shaky and oftentimes badly lit. It's cloying, fuzzy, vapid crap for middle-aged hippies who sit around in their sweaters smoking weed and drinking red wine. The music was also awful and quite repetitive. Want to watch a good movie with the same themes -- try 'Almost Famous'. Maybe the reason it works -- the lead characters are teenagers. It might have worked had that been done here. Seriously, what's with middle-aged guys who wear scarves who sing about how bad their life is and are still trying to become famous? The music was too much. It was like Coldplay but worse (I'm not kidding). The singer sings all the words normally and then picks one word out that he drags along like a piece of roadkill stuck on the rear fender of a pick-up truck.",Null,6,15,22 October 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," All image and no substance
","I was hoping Tim Burton was improving after his last film 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' impressed me. It was a great improvement over his previous films, 'Planet of the Apes', and 'Sleepy Hollow'.But Burton goes back to his old ways in 'Sweeney Todd'. It's the same problem I had with Burton's previous films, there's too much focus on art direction and not enough on the characters. Johnny Depp is a great actor, but he's useless in this and boring. He's not amusing and eccentric like he is in 'Charlie'.The songs pretty much all fall flat as well. None of them particularly stand out, they all sound like generic Broadway tunes, sometimes it's hard to tell a song in the movie from the last one.The art direction is good. It's gloomy as only Tim Burton does it. But it's not worth watching for the dull characters and lifeless plot. None of these Hollywood actors are very good singers either.",Null,2,5,24 October 2008
Gone Baby Gone," unrealistic Hollywood hot topic
","Hollywood loves hot topics like racism (Crash), the handicapped (Million Dollar Baby) and child abuse (Mystic River). This is another movie that centers around ideas which are highlighted by the sensational corporate media. I can't recommend this movie. The characters' motivations are completely unrealistic and of course all child abductors are fat coke-snorting, hillbilly pedophiles. It's usually mom, dad or some other family member. Realism is out the window within the first 10 minutes. The ending is so insanely stupid and 'surprising' in an unrealistic way that This is the kind of sub-mediocre film that usually wins Oscars. What a surprise that it didn't. What have I learned from this film? Ben Affleck is a bad director in addition to being a bad actor.",Null,1,3,24 October 2008
Knowing," Redundant
","Roger Ebert called it 'the best science fiction movie ever made'. It just happens to be made by the director and writer of Dark City, Alex Proyas, who is a friend of Ebert's. Roger Ebert did an audio commentary track for Proyas for the movie Dark City.Ebert is off his cancer meds if he thinks this movie is good. It's another unhealthy dose of religious propaganda from Hollywood. I was sickened by I Am Legend which turned the great original Matheson story into a religious propaganda piece.This movie is an original screenplay so it's less annoying but still a religious propaganda piece. It's hard to give reasons why without completely giving away the plot.I don't mind that the religious folks make movies like this but they should be honest about it. Everyone knew that the sci-fi film Battlefield Earth was written by the father of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. The writers of this film should have promoted it as a Christian science fiction movie. Then I could stay away and all the Christians could go to it in droves with their church. Even so, there's no science in this movie. Maybe science fiction wouldn't be the best term to use, maybe it's simply Christian propaganda.The acting was also very poor in this movie. I chuckled several times when Nicolas Cage got all serious. He's a widow with a child, a scenario all too familiar for these movies. Mel Gibson was a widowed single parent in the very similarly themed 'Signs'. The movie also reminded me of the struggling single mother in 'The Sixth Sense'. Both movies have elements of psychic children. We know Cage is a troubled man who has lost his faith (Hey, just like Mel Gibson in Signs!) because there are several scenes of him chugging liquor from a bottle.This movie is redundant religious crap. Don't waste your time.",Null,4,6,4 July 2009
"I, Robot"," Action flick dreck
",Isaac Asimov rolls in his grave as yet another sci-fi classic is turned into Hollywood action flick dreck. Are there any smart science fiction films any more? Most films in this genre tend to be more action than science fiction. This film is guilty in that case as there are more action sequences than dialogue and when there is dialogue it's just there to move the plot along to the next action sequence. Oddly enough the credits at the end read 'Suggested by Isaac Asimov' instead of 'based on the book by'. How many times in film have we seen one character who tells everyone else that they're in mortal danger and they never believe him until it's almost too late? We know what's going to happen. This film could have been an interesting metaphor for American xenophobia but instead is another crass summer action flick. Not surprisingly the same writing team went on to make 'I Am Legend' with Will Smith which also butchered the novella.,Null,3,4,13 July 2008
The White Ribbon," A brooding and messy metaphor
","'Das weisse Band' is disappointing compared to other German productions I've seen recently and I've become quite a big fan of German cinema. The story in this movie is extremely slow. There's very little tension around the events happening, there's more tension about the impending First World War but even that turns out to be a rather non-event. If you're looking for the political tension that was present in previous German films like 'The Lives Of Others' and 'Good-Bye Lenin' you won't find it here. There's not a lot to like. The cinematography is quite nice, the whole film is in black & white which extenuates the time and place. A few performances stand out as being quite good but the whole movie is steeped and stewed in metaphor.The White Ribbon is put on the children who do not behave. I'm thinking it's all about the last 'good' years before Germany entered the First World War and subsequently lost all its power and wealth until the late 20th century.",Null,5,16,18 December 2009
Gran Torino," Another illogical Eastwood ending
","This is yet again a pretty typical Clint Eastwood film. I'd say the only redeeming points were: some of the humour which poked fun at Eastwood's age and the acting of Ashney Her as the young Korean neighbour. Eastwood himself was fine but nothing special as an old angry curmudgeon (it's really not much of a stretch is it?). The problem I have with his films is that they lack any logical conclusion based in reality (particularly true of Million Dollar Baby). Same thing is true here. In the end of course Eastwood sacrifices himself for his new friends. It's completely illogical and is only used as a method for the audience to feel some sympathy for this 'hero' who lets himself get killed to save his friends. Was this the only real solution besides using violence and killing a bunch of people? Yes, the point is that he suffered for the violence he committed years earlier (that point was not lost on me) but it felt heavy-handed and manipulative for Eastwood to have to die in the end.The movie had a very mixed message about race as well. It seems that the message is that the only way an Asian family in America can thrive and survive in modern America is with the assistance and sacrifice of an old white male war veteran. There's so self-empowerment message here. It's all about relying on 'whitey' to survive in America. Eastwood's Libertarian/conservative views are obvious here. I really can't say much more about what a bad movie this is. One of the most overrated movies of 2008. Very badly acted. Very bad script. How many times must we see a white patriarch sacrifice himself at the end for the benefit of everyone. How utterly crass.",Null,10,21,16 December 2008
The Hurt Locker," An action movie which never becomes a drama
","A story about soldiers in Iraq whose job it is to disable IEDs. This movie is being sold as a drama that could potentially get many award nominations but it feels to me more like an ordinary action film. The motivations of the characters are never really known. Jeremy Renner plays the level-headed bomb defusing expert but we never really understand why he's so cool under pressure. Very few hints about his life at home are given, the story instead focuses on more scenes of action and suspense as he tries to defuse more bombs. The secondary characters are decent but the movie doesn't really move beyond being a movie about the tough guy camaraderie in Iraq.The Iraqis themselves are background characters except for one kid who is only used as a plot device to show that Jeremy Renner is a good guy whereas everyone else is simply 'bad ass'.",Null,1,4,11 December 2009
The Dark Knight," Doesn't match 'Begins' but it's pretty good.
","First of all this is not as good as Batman Begins. I liked the Batman origin story of 'Begins'. The Batman origin had never been shown on film and was very interesting to see. It felt less like a Batman film than a modern action/thriller. That was good as we moved away from the Tim Burton campiness. But the main reason to see this film is obviously Heather Ledger's performance as The Joker. I don't think he deserves any awards for the role, but for a role in a summer blockbuster it's well-acted and interesting. Ledger takes the best things about Nicholson's Joker and adds his own little elements here and there to make the character even more diabolical. The story does drag at times but there's enough sequences to keep it interesting. The addition of Two-Face wasn't necessary in this movie but follows the trend started way back in 1992 with Batman Returns of having two villains for the comic book movie sequel. One only needs to look at Spider-Man 3 to see how this can turn a movie very sour very quickly. I wouldn't have minded Two-Face so much in the movie had he remained Harvey Dent and Nolan saved Dent for the next Batman movie. Ledger and Bale could have easily held their own in this movie.",Null,4,9,19 July 2008
Into the Wild," Wonderfully told
","One of the better movies of 2007. If you're a fan of the book 'Into the Wild' then you'll be impressed with this production which doesn't take any liberties with the story.The acting is good and consistent here. The only downside I can see is the occasional poor direction by Sean Penn. Sometimes his 'poetic' style is a bit much and a bit forced. We can make some connections on our own without the help of the director.That being said the scenery is beautiful. The acting is great, especially by Emile Hersch but at times I felt like certain aspects of the story could be cut out to focus more on certain points of Chris' life.",Null,0,1,24 October 2008
Avatar," All effects, poor characters and a poor story
","Watching Avatar I felt like I was trapped in a pastel landscape. All the colours in this movie are bright greens, blues and pinks. I wondered for a while why this was familiar but then it dawned on me that it's oceanic landscapes which James Cameron obviously has an affinity for, judging from his previous record.The storyline is very basic here. Big bad imperialists come to a planet to rape it and steal a precious stone which is worth lots of money, the stone in this case is 'hillariously' referred to as 'unobtainium'. The natives of course must all be crushed, conquered and moved away from the precious resource. It has shades of the 2003 Iraq War but the metaphor is developed poorly and it's never especially subtle. At one point an invasion on the native peoples is referred to as 'shock and awe'.The idea of avatars, creatures created from human DNA but meant to look like the native aliens is interesting. The invaders download their brain into the avatar and then walk around among the natives. Humans are the invaders in this story, it's supposed to be a flip-side version of Aliens, but we still have those robotic machines people get into which mimic their movements. It's a James Cameron trope now.James Cameron isn't an especially good writer. I think that much was obvious when he strayed from science-fiction with Titanic. Almost everything about that movie was good except for the acting and writing, which is a pretty major flaw in any movie. The writing isn't much better in Avatar, there are a lot of eye-rolling cornball lines. Clich√©s like 'We're not in Kansas anymore' are quite prevalent here. None of the characters are as well manicured as the CGI and other effects. The only real stand-out performance here, even for an action movie, is Sigorney Weaver, and she mostly rehashes her performance from the Alien movies. Sam Worthington is adequate but he never really wowed me either with his performance of a disabled Marine who gets the chance to bounce around a forest with fairy tale creatures.The effects are okay but the design is pretty hokey at times. I didn't care much for the pallet of colours that Cameron used here. There's a lot of magical and mythical creatures flying around, Cameron really wanted us to see this world he has created but then he forgot about all the characters. The only Na'vi character we really get to know is Jake Sully's girlfriend, Neytiri. The rest are pretty much dismissed and blend into the blue backgrounds except when they are required for the final attack on the humans.The final confrontation is pretty bad as well. The major characters all end up in peril of course and James Horner's score reaches its irritating crescendo. The odds are obviously stacked against the native Na'vi but this is fiction, in James Cameron's world anything is possible.",Null,7,16,21 December 2009
Invictus," Politics and sports come together decently
","I don't like many of Eastwood's emotionally cloying films like 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'Gran Torino'. Emotional harp strings are played frequently in those movies.Invictus is quite different. The movie is a biopic but it's not a biopic, it's about one part of Mandela's life. It's a very small part, the 1995 Rugby World Cup which was held in South Africa. This is a risky move, but this is in fact better than doing a complete biopic of Mandela's life. I would compare this movie to last year's Frost/Nixon, it's a glimpse of the man's life, a part of his life deemed important not by the man himself but by his biographers.Freeman is quite good but his accent is a bit flaky at times. Damon is alright as well but he doesn't have much to work with here as the captain of the South Africa Rugby squad. A lot of it is working up his teammates and convincing them that there is a political purpose behind their team winning.There is still some manipulation here as there always in Eastwood's films. A plane flies over at one point and the music gets all ominous and tense. Your first thought is 'OH MY GOD, IT'S THE TERRORISTS' but it's subterfuge on Eastwood's part, as usual.The musical score is also quite bad in a few places. Instead of going with a traditional instrumental score, there are bad pieces of modern adult contemporary music.Overall it's a pretty decent movie and I liked Freeman in his role as Mandela, I can't imagine anyone else really taking on this role. Maybe there is a South African actor out there who could do it. There are South African actors in this movie and it's really quite hard to understand their accent at times.",Null,2,3,26 December 2009
Zombieland," It's another zombie comedy
","Zombieland is the newest in the genre which I will now classify as the 'zombie comedy'. The genre began perhaps with the greatest zombie comedy 'Shaun of the Dead'. That movie was extremely funny and one of my favourite films of 2004. Unfortunately Zombieland is very short on laughs as well as lovable, memorable characters like Shaun of the Dead. The plot meanders and then ends with a silly climax that isn't all that rewarding for the viewer. There's lots of shooting zombies and explanations of the rules of a zombie world but all-in-all it's more like a video game than an actual movie. There have been a lot of zombie comedies in the past but this isn't all that special. It's even worse than the extremely mediocre 'Fido' which at least added the element of social satire.That's probably one element which should have been included. The social satire element was what made 'Shaun of the Dead' a great movie instead of just a good one. Using zombies as a social satire first evolved as an idea with George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' in 1978.This movie also uses 'zoombies' instead of zombies. I'm not sure why. Slow zombies are funnier, but maybe the movie wanted to separated itself from Shaun of the Dead. Save the zoombies for movies like 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake.There's zombie video games, board games, books, CDs, all numbers of things. Hipsters love their zombies so the movie was a guaranteed hit. Maybe that's the reason the movie was ultimately low on plot and high on concept.",Null,0,1,7 November 2009
Inception," A mediocre blockbuster
","I like Christopher Nolan. I did before he even did the Batman movies. Following was quite an interesting movie and Memento is one of the best movies of its decade. The Batman movies were good too, Nolan did something new and interesting with Batman and made Tim Burton look like an art school douche.This is all to preface that Inception is a mediocre movie. No, it's not especially deep. A dream within a dream within a dream. It's about as philosophically deep as The Matrix and the execution is slightly better.Leo is Leo. He essentially plays the same character he did in 'Shutter Island', which I thought was a total mess. His wife is crazy and Leo just wants to set everything straight and go back to a normal existence. He'll do anything it takes and meanwhile will grimace, look stern and squint his way through the movie.The plot is decent but I thought it got bogged down in senseless shoot-outs, three layers of shoot-outs actually, which are all happening simultaneously. The direction here is pretty clever but the movie isn't. The scenes in the second dream layer take place in a wintry landscape where there is a fortress on the side of a mountain. The whole thing is very James Bond, especially when guys on motorized ski-machines start coming out of the forest shooting guns. There are a lot of shots fired from guns, all kinds of guns, with probably thousands of bullets, few hit anyone. At that point I give up. I've seen it before and I pretty much started losing interest.This is a blockbuster, not a movie about characters, plot or right-and-wrong. It's not thought-provoking in the least. The technology is never explained, which is probably for the best as it's inexplicable. Although, 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Eternal Sunshine' both did a much better job without ever explaining much of anything. The story is interesting enough to recommend. A few effects scenes are good.The acting isn't very strong either. Leo acts like he does in most of his other movies, notably 'Shutter Island' and 'The Departed'. He has his game face on. I'm kind of sick of his game face. It's that 'Something very serious is happening' look that is way over the top. http://tinyurl.com/29hqqcp (Let's discuss the serious part of the movie).",Null,3,6,6 November 2010
Pineapple Express," Not smooth and mellow but angsty, angry and trippy.
","The first half hour of 'Pineapple Express' was pretty good but then it turns into something completely different -- an action caper. At this point you could swear it was directed by Tarantino or something. Shooting people up and violence on top of violence isn't funny. This was more of a trippy comic caper than a laid back mellow stoner film. I will say the best part of the movie was James Franco playing a stoned drug dealer. He played the part beautifully. The excellent chemistry was thrown out the window once the characters picked up guns and started shooting people. Yes, it's very obvious that Rogen wrote this when he was a stoned teenager. It's not surprising then that those are the people who will most enjoy this film.",Null,4,9,24 October 2008
Moon," Man on the Moon
","Ground control to major Tom? Moon is directed by 38 year old Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie. So maybe it's not a big coincidence that his first feature film is Moon with Sam Rockwell.I think Rockwell is a much under-appreciated character actor of the past 15 years. I'd first dismissed him when I saw the Green Mile and believed that this guy was basically a typecast actor who always played the role of the out of control crazy guy. How wrong I was. Rockwell has been amazing in movies like Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Snow Angels and Frost/Nixon. He's definitely not a one note actor.In Moon he goes where Tom Hanks went in Cast Away and Wil Smith went in I Am Legend. He is basically alone on screen except for the comfort of his HAL-like computer, Gerty. The difference between Rockwell and Wil Smith is that Smith was laughable in I Am Legend and Rockwell can hold his own on the screen.I've often complained in the past that science fiction has turned into science fiction action. We only need to look at most of Wil Smith's more recent work to see that this is the case. Even when movies are adapted from old source material like 'I Am Legend' and 'I Robot', the movie becomes an action-packed, ray-gun totin' adventure where the body count is high and the story is limited.This isn't the case with 'Moon'. It's a pretty old fashioned sci-fi story which kind of has a Twilight Zone episode feel to it. This isn't to say that the sets, production design and special effects aren't great because they are, but they never overwhelm the story.There were a few sequences where I was looking at it trying to see if I could see the strings and wires but then I stopped looking because the story was actually pretty engaging. This movie could have actually been done on a much lower budget and still been as effective.The story is pretty simple and is predictable at times but it's still fun to see Rockwell on screen. There are a few surprises of course and at the end we're left wanting more. That's a clear sign of a good movie in my books.",Null,0,2,28 October 2009
Valkyrie," Everything a political thriller should be!
","There have been some negative reviews for this so I came into it expecting it to be mediocre but it was actually quite good. Suspenseful and thrilling,t his is what a political thriller should be like. It was certainly more interesting than a political film which got a lot more attention -- Frost/Nixon. Sure, that was a stage play and this is an original film but both films about are about politics and people deciding how far they will go to reveal their leaders true intentions. This film is 2 hours but there's not a moment where you're waiting for it to be over. The same can't be said of the meandering Frost/Nixon which takes an hour before the interviews even start. I'd rate Valkyrie near the top of my list for best films of 2008. Tom Cruise is actually quite suited to this role. He's a capable actor in the right hands. We just have to remember Rain Man or Born on the Fourth of July to prove that.",Null,4,8,23 February 2009
