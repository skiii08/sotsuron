United 93," a brilliant action movie written by life
","This film is a brilliant action film written by life. I was deeply touched by the idea that people really can do such a hijacking without any emotions. I also felt with the passengers and their attempt to turn the situation. Unfortunately the film misses any psychological depth or political statement. What makes people in the third world and some Islamic countries so frustrated that they are open for the fanatic wire-puller who seduce people to such a criminal action.What is the role of the USA and their neocolonialistic friends in the global play, what about the crime of poverty and suppression which is the ground of terrorism. To be very clear: all the negative influence of the west may never be an excuse for murdering innocent people wherever in the world. What about the feelings of the passengers and their intention to turn the situation as hopeless as it it. How develops the team dynamic which empowers them to come to action which is a last chance but it also might be a suicide action. A lot of questions which will made it more than just an action movie. At the end all this questions are still open, they are even not asked. Considering the missed possibilities of the historical and human background I was more than a little bit disappointed.",7,0,2,26 June 2006
