Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar Stinks
","Honestly, despite some flawed conceptions such as taking a comical approach, trying to inject comedy here and there (if it actually worked, I would'nt be complaining) and a horrible character addition called Jar Jar St/Binks for supposed comic relief, this movie is no where as bad as people try to portray. As a matter of fact, its nothing less than fantastic. You'd have thunk that the creators and writers ran out of ideas by this time but they've actually come up with plenty of new ones. All of the usual Star Wars material and charm is present in quantity enough to satisfy any Star Wars fan so I really don't realise where all the rants stem from? The battle sequences were at least way better than in the LoTR.",10,1,2,6 August 2006
