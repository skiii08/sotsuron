10 Cloverfield Lane," Bunker Buster
","Like a fast-food meal for the mind, this film is slickly assembled, mildly tasty and composed of utterly manufactured elements that contain only the barest quantity of real nourishment.Treading over very similar ground to numerous other confinement stories, and positioned as a largely in-name-only sequel to the JJ Abrams' found-footage monster flic, the nudgingly titled 10 Cloverfield Lane has a solid cast, sharply written (if episodic and predictable) script and a clean, stylish look, but - much like the subsequent The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) - in the final analysis it simply can't escape the impression that it is an wholly unrelated story that has been hastily modified and had a title slapped on it to shoehorn its narrative into an contrived franchise relationship with the earlier film.For most of its length, its an effectively staged post-apocalyptic survival picture; as the possibly PTSD suffering, conspiracy-believing, doomsday-planning survival nut, who rescues/kidnaps and browbeats a young woman and a farm hand who helped him build his bomb shelter, John Goodman gives a fine portrayal of quietly spoken, barely repressed insanity, a bit like a shell-shocked Alex Jones (although with a far greater sense of wounded dignity). The other characters are stock and under-developed but ably served by competent work from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr.Though very well produced and tightly directed, the film never really gets going; hampered by a limited budget and PG-13 rating, we never get much of a sense of the destruction we're told has been wrought in the world above, aside from one effective sequence where a lone survivor attempts to enter the shelter from above. Having established the claustrophobic setting and ambiguous anti-hero, the film quickly quickly runs out of ideas, and ultimately resorts to an ill-advised action finale - clearly tacked on at the producer's request - which negates much of the previous built-up tension and tips the whole enterprise into clumsy self-parody.In the end it's neither the intelligent confinement thriller it could have been, nor an imaginative or logical continuation of the Ahbrams picture, but a curious hybrid assembly that adds up to considerably less than the sum of its parts.",4,0,1,24 January 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Bores
","This is a pointless, poorly written and acted cash-in, that wrecks several points of series continuity for no discernable purpose while adding nothing of value to the canon.Godzilla (2016) director Gareth Edwards has another visually well crafted but otherwise empty action spinoff to add to his short CV; concerned with telling the story of the rebel spy faction that stole the plans of the first Death Star, mentioned in passing in A New Hope (1977), Rogue One is a sloppily contrived fan film peopled by two-dimensional (in some cases literally, with both Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher represented by doll-eyed CGI clones) characters and a tired storyline, the conclusion of which can surprise no-one who has viewed any of the original episodes.Felicity Jones makes little impression in the lead, her permanent expression of sulky insouciance failing to endear, while Diego Luna is possibly the wettest leading man since Patrick Duffy. The supporting cast, including Donnie Yen as an amateur Jedi and Alan Tudyuk as a sarcastic droid fair a little better, but are given distressingly little room to develop.Pace, narrative focus and dialogue are all of highly variable quality, and the shrill, hand-me-down score can never reach the evocative heights of John Williams' venerable theme music. FX (CGI Leia and Moff Tarkin aside) and visual compositions are predictably impressive, but without an emotional centre to the story it becomes hard to care, and with the outcome already known it's ultimately a wearisome affair, made worse by some egregious plotting that bungles the attempt to link with the original trilogy.At least we are spared any embarrassing histrionics from Darth Vader, ala Revenge of the Sith (2005), but it's small consolation in a totally misconceived and gratuitous exercise in cinematic fan-fiction, that adds nothing and only further degrades the canon while trying to enlarge it.",1,0,6,28 September 2018
The Shining," Cold and Empty
","Stephen King, like horror's other Maine man HP Lovecraft, has at best a patchy record when it comes to successful transfers of his work to the screen. Ironically, it is often the least faithful adaptions that make for the more effective and satisfying pictures.What can be said, then, about this film? An adaptation of King's dense and personal novel that dumps about 80% of the book's narrative detail, substituting arty visuals and sub-Hitchcockian compositions for anything resembling a developed script or well-rounded characters, preserving the superficial elements and iconography of the book, but failing to provide any compelling hook on which to hang it's virtuoso production values. The product of a notoriously painstaking, difficult (mostly due to the director's auteurish fastidiousness) and long-drawn-out shoot, this version of The Shining is undoubtedly beautiful to look at, sumptuously shot and packed with minute visual detail. Where it falls down is in its near-complete absence of compelling human drama, with characters so thinly drawn as to be almost translucent, and an incredible, overripe lead performance by Jack Nicholson.As the blocked writer who accepts a job as winter caretaker of The Overlook hotel in the picturesque Colorado mountains, slowly succumbing to the hotel's evil influence as snow and isolation draw in, Nicholson's performance is possibly one of the most spectacularly misjudged lead portrayals in American cinema. No slow, detailed progression from calm family man to unhinged, axe-swinging maniac for Jack it seems. Rather, he comes across as a man teetering on the brink right from the get-go, making the simple announcement that he has an appointment with the manager of the hotel seem like a veiled threat. Shelley Duvall fairs a little better as his beleaguered wife, but it's clear Kubrick sees her mainly as a prop, there to be placed in peril, scream and cry and suffer hysterics.As in command as he is of the film's aesthetic aspects, Kubrick shows himself seemingly incapable of handling the ordinary business of building a narrative, or of drawing layered performances from his heavyweight cast. If reports from the shoot are to be believed, Kubrick's relentless perfectionism forced as many as 120+ takes on his actors in certain scenes. How then to account for the stilted, one-dimensional nature of the family's early interactions, or Nicholson's obviously unhinged manner from their very first arrival at the hotel? While never known for his restraint, Nicholson goes full bore here, and the effect - although occasionally chilling - is weirdly self-conscious and distant. Similarly, if he is to be credited for the picture's fine qualities, then Kubrick must also bear responsibility for its gaping flaws; the sloppy structure, the jarring whip-pans and clumsy crash-zooming, the conspicuously English accents of all the ghostly Overlook staff and guests despite the Colorado setting (betraying the fact of its actual production on a London soundstage), the choppy editing, the melodramatic musical score, the emotional vacuity and absence of feeling in the human relationships, and the general sense of paralysis that permeates the whole project, as if the director's exacting standards had so intimidated everyone involved that they could only follow his strict commands, and all creative energy was effectively beaten out of them.By its final frames, this film has inspired neither terror nor sympathy, neither interest nor tension, but has merely served as an exemplary lesson in the folly of directorial arrogance, and a cautionary to the dangers of forgetting, or deliberately neglecting to tell, an actual story.",3,4,7,1 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: The Worst Said I
","'What we've got here is, failure to continuate...'Although highly derivative of earlier installments, and plot-wise largely a retread of George Lucas's original Star Wars (1977), now retconned to Episode IV: A New Hope in the official chronology, JJ Abrams' franchise-restarter The Force Awakens (2015) was at least a clean, unpretentiously juvenile action-adventure that played effectively on fans' expectations, and set up both a serviceable new cast of characters and a charted a direction for future installments that offended (nearly) no-one.With this follow-up installment, however, writer-director Rian Johnson appears to have deliberately taken Abrams' fan-service blueprint and chucked it in the shredder, scotch-taped the strands back together in an impressionistic collage and embellished it with more new featured characters seemingly parachuted in from the the type of edgy, self-referential indie flicks with which he made his name.To say that the plot is disjointed, dull, illogical, full of narrative blind alleys and almost mischievously nonsensical twists, or that it carelessly dumps most of the more interesting supporting roles and subplots from the previous installment in favour of cutesy-annoying ethnic stereotypes and campy guest-star turns by the likes of Benecio Del Toro, or to observe that Johnson seems not to possess any firm concept of space, time, distance, gravity or narrative consistency, would be to rake over territory covered in far greater detail elsewhere. Suffice to say that nothing that The Last Jedi introduces to the Star Wars universe has any value beyond momentary audience disorientation, and that the few effective sequences Johnson does pull off - the Hyperspace ramming sequence is undeniably impressive - are all immediately undercut by dramatic scenes which fall hopelessly flat, thanks largely to a strand of self-referential humour that is neither funny nor particularly clever, or by Johnson's borderline malicious determination not to deliver any of the really big moments longtime fans of this series might reasonably expect.Among the casualties of this revisionist approach are Daisy Ridley's lead performance as Rey, carried over from the previous picture but here reduced to a shrill, one-dimensional 'good-girl', whose abilities in force-control and light-sabre fighting are accomplished in ridiculously easy, low pressure fashion (mainly by swinging one around a rock for about a minute), thus robbing her journey of any drama or sense of fulfilment. Likewise Jon Boyega's Finn, relegated to secondary plot status and mostly a figure of comic-relief, Gwendoline Christie's Captain Phasma (killed off in a listless duel aboard a burning space cruiser, which strangly still manages to have functioning gravity), Bill Nighy's Lord Snoke (heavily set up in The Force Awakens as a final boss for the new trilogy, but likewise dispatched with irritating abruptness) and, perhaps most tragically for fans, Mark Hamill as an aging and embittered Luke Skywalker, diminished by both the size of his role and the pathetic emotional condition of the character to a whiny, cynical old recluse, beaten in a stick-duel by Rey and eventually force-ghosted with little explanation or impact.Ultimately, this fails to be either a satisfactory follow-up to Abrams's fan-film homage, an interesting recalibration away from simple crowd-pleasing heroics or even a well-told escapist fantasy in its own right. Instead, it's a janky, badly plotted and annoyingly contrived mess, with pointless supporting characters, pointedly unexplained departures from the previous films (which feel crudely shoehorned in for plot convenience) and a dimly perceptable inbuilt contempt for the audience, one that colours the film's treatment of main series characters and the overriding themes of previous Star Wars pictures.It's clear that what Johnson set out to create was essentially an anti-Star Wars picture; in that he has been successful, but this film is a disaster.",1,28,39,1 June 2019
