The Blair Witch Project," tense and shilling and left with jaws agape..brilliant
","i pride myself in not being a follower so refused to succumb to the hype and then it wore off as time passed by. I finally picked up the DVD in 2006 for the $1/week rental and thought I'd 'give it a go'.To this day I'm glad i did and i just cannot understand the negatives written about this film.It has to rate as one of the best movies I've seen and certainly the scariest.to give you some perspective i rate such movies as fight club, schindler's list, back to the future part 1, scarface, platoon, pirates of the ..., good will hunting, dead poets society..as great films for different reasons- not one 'scary movie' amongst them and consider myself hard to please and intolerant of poor scripts, story lines, over production (gladiator ruined itself IMO on some dodgy lines and over production) and anything that seems ridiculous and out of context with the premise..so i find myself rarely recommending a movie as unfortunately these ar few and far between.This finds its was to the very top in my book though. Dare I say masterpiece?...i have to wait for 2-3 years to watch it again though..which i will..the first year to recover from the shock, the next to rave about it and the final to start forgetting it.Tim",10,1,3,5 June 2008
