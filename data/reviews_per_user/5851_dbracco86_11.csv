The Ring," WOW!
","This was such a surprise! OK,yes, the beginning was way too typical horror movie, but the rest was SO WELL DONE.  For the first time ever I screamed in a theater--four times! Absolutely scary without being gory (for the most part, except for those faces...ew).  I was totally enticed from beginning (although not original, suspenseful) until the end. There's not much more to say other than GO SEE IT!!! 10/10",10,0,0,19 October 2002
Monster," How could anyone even pose a threat to Charlize Theron?
","I really need to see the other movies that had a Best Actress nominated to see why Charlize Theron wasn't a slam dunk for the Oscar.  She was NOTHING short of brilliant.Her acting job in this movie was indescribably impeccable.  The range and depth isn't even worth commenting on, because words could not do it justice.I've heard that people were amazed by her performance but disappointed with the movie, and I don't know how they can think that.  She is in nearly (except for a few short scenes with just Christina Ricci) every scene in the movie (which is an incredible feat to pull off so well). 
The movie was depressing, gruesome, heartbreaking, and phenomenal.  I had to sit for a little bit through the credits to gather myself after being hit so hard with such a 'downer,' yet amazing, movie. Anyone who just loves to keep up with the Academy Award nominations, or appreciates incredible acting should definitely treat themselves to this.",10,0,1,6 March 2004
The Impossible," A visceral, harrowing portrayal of one family's experience during the 2004 tsunami
","I'm not even sure it's fair to count what I'm about to say as a spoiler because it has become a widely known true story, but the warning is there anyway. From this point forward I will discuss all aspects of the film, including the ending.I think it's important to point out that while the film's conceit--the focus on one Spanish-turned-British family who somehow managed to all survive--may bother some, and it's a worthy point, I also think that complaint is a little unfair. The creators of the film and all involved have been very clear that they became attached to this one woman's story, and that's the film's perspective. Maria Belon, the real-life mother of the family, was on the set much of the time ensuring that everything took place as it was. Who are we to deny her interpretation of that day? From her perspective, ethnicities took a back seat to humanity, and the people of Thailand took time away from their own grief and ailments to help her and her son. That is what she knows, and that is what this story is about.For as much as I read about the tsunami sequence (and I read a lot about it), I still wasn't prepared for how visceral it was going to be. It's very difficult to watch--overwhelming, even. The 3D sound engineering is incredible...and loud. But you're in it, as much as I believe a viewer possibly could be. You panic for these characters. And when it's over, you feel as scattered as they do. It's a really remarkable, watershed moment in physical film making.The journey that follows is paced and structured nicely. We follow Maria (Naomi Watts) and her eldest son, Lucas (Tom Holland) through their story until it comes to a distinct point, then we see where Henry (Ewan McGregor) and the other two boys are before their stories inevitably converge. Because I knew the ending of the story--because it was marketed as a story of their survival--this isn't the typical 'will they/won't they' trope of disaster movies (and, I suppose, romantic comedies). It's more in the 'how'--how will they find each other amidst the chaos, and when? And when they do is the only real critique I have of the film. The film has been building toward this moment and the actors have propelled us there emotionally--the sweeping, melodramatic score at the moment of their reunion is almost distracting, and I imagine it will become even more so upon repeated viewings when I'm less taken in by the story unfolding.An ultimately minor quibble amongst an extraordinary movie, however. The three leads are sublime, brave, and earnest. Holland is a real find; the film sits squarely, unfairly on his shoulders and he carries it with real gravitas and poise that defy the fact this is his first on-camera film. McGregor's role is more limited, but no less powerful, particularly in one devastating scene when he must make the dreaded phone call home. Finally, Watts continues to prove that when it comes to physical and emotional anguish, no one can hit the same real nerve as she can. She gives way to the weight of the story (and water) as if she were a cartoon, bending her body, face, and voice to the will of the elements and the emotions. Her story on the page must read rather one dimensional, but on the screen it is deeply layered. Her connection with Belon is evident; she very much embodies this mother. Hopefully this will finally mark the turn in how people view her as an actress and she starts getting all the lofty praise she deserves.The Impossible may have arrived too late and may be too intense for the award season powers that be, and it will always come with the asterisk of controversy with regard to is particular portrayal, but I feel like that complaint comes from those who decided the film was in the wrong before they saw it. As the film comes to its conclusion, it isn't a happy story about a family that found each other against impossible odds. It's a somber, honest conclusion about the pain of surviving and the fragility of life as much as it is about the marketed triumph of the human spirit. Spirit got this family far, but not as far as pure, inconsistent, and unfair luck. And I think this movie knows it.",10,6,14,28 December 2012
Forrest Gump," Such an incredible movie...
","I honestly thought there was no way you could NOT like this movie.  Well, apparently I was wrong. It's absolutely incredible!  The movie discontinues an increasing trend that movies are held up by great effects rather than great acting.  The three lead actors (Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise) all deserved Oscars for their stellar work. True, this follows the ingredients to get Oscars, BUT, it helped pave the way for that 'recipe.' 10/10",10,1,2,28 July 2002
Cold Mountain," Excellent
","This movie was leading the Oscar race before it even came out--with it's budget and pedigree, it was touted as the next big epic.  No pressure...It succeeded.  It's a great movie, gritty, powerful, engaging, and wonderfully directed and acted.  It's not quite amazing, but it's worthy of the attention it has received (namely by the Golden Globes).As much as I love Nicole Kidman and how well she did, Renee Zellweger is the best part of the movie.  Her often humorous, yet diverse, roll was perfectly done on her part.  Jude Law was great in the roll that where all the 'gritty' parts take place, as he is a soldier in the Civil War who escapes to travel home (treason).  Nicole Kidman tries to have a southern accent, and it slips every now and then.  I'm not sure if she was supposed to have a big one, as I think her character doesn't originally come from the south...at any rate, she's great, as usual.  While it's not as 'rangey' of a character as past performances (namely Moulin Rouge), she takes her role and owns it, sans a perfect accent.I didn't care for all the historical, not harsh, gore, but that's just me. The two and half hours don't fly by, but I was never pondering when the movie was finally going to end.  It was very well done, just short of incredible.  9/10",9,1,1,28 December 2003
Moulin Rouge!," I can't find the words...
","Oh wait, I found them.  F*** you Renee!!  You only sat through half the movie, so in what position are you to judge the MOVIE if you only saw half of it.  I wish I could put my f***ing fist through the screen and tear your face off!  The fact that you had the audacity to assume that the academy was 'kicking themselves' over the movie nominations shows what an insignificant brain you have.  First of all, over 5,000 people vote for the Academy (hopefully the percentages of 'renees' is as small as you ability to hold a rational thought), so 5,000 people aren't all screwed in the head, YOU ARE! Moving on, this was a movie to better all movies.  Forget that it was the most entertaining film, if you actually WATCHED the whole movie, Nicole Kidman's acting in the end betters anyone.  And Ewan McGregor's sadness is unbelievably convincing.  Just think, if they had done the right thing by letting Nicole Kidman win the oscar, we could have been spared Halle Berry's minute-long niagra falls impression.  (Okay, that's a little overboard.  I'm happy for her, but for her to go on and on about she broke a barrier that was already done for her; maybe more black people would win if they started doing movies that required more range than 'How High'). THis was an incredible movie with an incredible cast with an incredible director.  END OF DISCUSSION.",10,1,2,5 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Pleasantly Surprised!
","I wasn't ever planning on seeing this movie, but now that I saw it I'm bummed I didn't get to see it in the theater.  It was amazing!  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor can really sing AND act, rare...I was entertained the whole time.  There could have been a war going on around me while I was watching it and I wouldn't have noticed, I was so entranced.  I can see how some people may not be able to take it in, but if you're open to it all the colors, music, and choreography trap you.  This movie deserves to win Best Picture, Best Actor/Actress, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Original Song, Best Costume, and more!",10,0,1,28 December 2001
Garden State," Absolutely refreshing
","I didn't really know what this movie was all about before going to it, other than I had heard pretty good things about it.It was a refreshing break for movies as a whole. It's subtle sarcasm and wit are perfectly placed throughout the film, bringing in many laugh out loud moments.What it manages to capture though is the true gift: the real life aspects of comedy, disappointment, taking chances, fear, etc., are all so flawlessly blended together that the movie's pace is extremely natural and relaxing. Very rarely can a movie go from making you laugh out loud to feeling the tears come out with the character themselves so smoothly and realistically, but this movie manages to do that. 10/10",10,1,1,6 September 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Very mediocre
","I didn't hate this film, but I certainly didn't love it...or like it a lot. I had the pleasure of seeing four of the five movies nominated for 'Best Picture' (all but The Lord of the Rings), and of those I would rate it number four. Again, not to see it was bad, but it wasn't Best Picture winner quality by any means.  Or maybe it was so insanely Best Picture winner mainstream it was annoying. Moulin Rouge was fantastical and original.  Gosford Park was exceptionally witty.  In the Bedroom tore at your emotions with stellar acting.  A Beautiful Mind had good acting, not even great acting. I'm sure I'm a little bias because I hate Russell Crowe because he's such an ass, but all the characters were so one-dimensional.  The only part in the movie I moved at all was when the baby was drowning, and that could have stirred me even in the epitomy of all badness: Bowfinger. Very very very very AVERAGE.",3,2,4,5 June 2002
Signs," Not-so-great...(SPOILERS!)
","The beginning of this movie is very good.  It was very suspenseful and it made me jump. The part of the movie I have a problem with is the biggest part: the storyline.  It has holes and more importantly it is so out there it makes the aliens look possible.  I had no idea so much 'fate' was going to be brought into this.  The worst part was how the boy, Morgan, didn't die because his lungs were closed when the gas was going into him.  That was just sappy writing.  (Also, the aliens were like humans in a costume). 6/10",1,2,3,5 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Can we say fab?
","Yes, we can!  I mean honestly, what more can we say about an ultramod finale to the LOTR trilogy.  Everything from Billy Boyd's singing, to Orlando's every move...perfection.  Shore's music combined with every camera shot makes for an incredible, oscar-winning film.  The cast is comprised of talented individuals that bring Tolkien's book to life.  It does what it can, and as for the long ending that some audience members feel is too long...how could the film possibly end any sooner? The story itself is huge, so with all respect to finding closure in each aspect of the storyline, every moment of the ending is necessary. (And to the LOTR diehards...who wants to end the movie?) This is an absolutely fabulous movie, period.",10,0,0,27 December 2003
