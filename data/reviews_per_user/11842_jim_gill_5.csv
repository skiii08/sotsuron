Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than people give it credit for
","The Star Wars films are kids films. The adults now reviewing the prequels are disappointed because they're now adults - they're no longer watching it from a child's perspective. Their kids take their queues from their parents and say they don't like it either, but I think that's unfair.
I often wonder if Jar Jar Binks would now be considered a beloved character - had this film be realised first. Clearly this is also the conclusion that Lucas reached when the recent sequels were made.
Personally I enjoyed this film because I went into it expecting a film aimed at kids and not expecting an adult version üëç",8,4,8,12 August 2019
Marie Antoinette," Let's gloss over the important bits of the actual story...
","With a backdrop of the French Revolution, this film had the potential to be something great. It was not. Although FAIRLY accurate, for the most part, I can't help but wonder how Sofia Coppola managed to make this film ramble on for over two hours and never touch on the politics that lead to the Bourbon downfall. No mention of Antionette passing military secrets to the Austrians; no mention of their coversion to a constitutional monarchy or their house arrest in Paris. no mention of their attempted escape to Austria or their capture. No mention of their trial and eventual execution; or the allegations of incest - all of these things could have been used to make the film so much more poignant but it was clearly made by someone who just thought it was 'romantic', so glossed over the most important parts of the story - in favour of showing some dappy bint going to parties and getting her hair done. Also, considering the time and money they'd obviously spent making this, you'd have thought they'd have used an appropriate soundtrack too. No, they decided that contemporary pop/rock music best represented revolutionary France... really? Such a good opportunity wasted.",3,1,1,19 October 2017
Rocketman," Ok if you like musicals
","I was hoping this would be more of a Bohemian Rhapsody style dramatisation rather than a musical.... I don't do musicals.
That said, I did manage to get most of the way through before giving up so it cant be too bad üëç",5,3,5,12 August 2019
Twilight," I tried, I honestly did
","After hearing all the hype about the film, I gave it a go but only lasted 20 minutes before I turned it off.
Not wanting to judge it based solely on the film, I tried reading the book too (the books are ALWAYS better than the films).
Unfortunately I came to the disheartening conclusion that both the book and the film have one fundamental flaw - they're both crap.",1,2,7,5 June 2019
Joker," Great acting but a bit dull
","I can't complain about the acting but I was a little disappointed that this was more a commentary on mental health than the DC origins story I was hoping for. The climax fell a little short for me too, so I was disappointed overall at what has to have been the most hyped film of the year.
Still better than Ad Astra though.",6,4,8,12 November 2019
