The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Here is hoping that Part 2 has a little more action!
",I adore the franchise. I hated it when I first watched Twilight but with time I am a complete fan and couldn't wait to watch this episode.I have not read the books but I kind of wished I had done as I am continually reminded how much better they are.This is surely the last stepping stone though as I found myself wondering if there will ever be any action or real confrontations! I always get the feeling i am being short changed by the studios! The fight scene between Edward and the Volteri in New Moon and the mini war with the new borns just seemed too rushed and under used. There is no action in this movie however I had prepared myself for that. I can simply say it like it really has to be said..... Don't watch it if you ain't seen all the others or you ain't a fan.... You simply come on this site to discourage others. For the Twilight fans amongst us.... and I am a grown man certainly not lusting after the Edward and Jacob crews (definately a Rosalie fan however) its a certainty that you will enjoy it and be gripped into the final installment which is far too far away!!!,6,10,22,18 November 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Really??? Are you kidding
",Nothing more than an extremely rushed... unrealistic... strange mismash of films all merged into a fast forwarded 90mins of nothing really.Characters left no mark on the viewers. So many English accents from SOME Hollywood stars seemed unnecessary.Story was poor and extremely predictable! My friend loved it.... but if its a super hero or a computer game he will always be content!Aestetically pleasing however I just felt bored and not in the slightest bit challenged by this movie.Go and see it if there isn't something you want to see on instead or everything else is sold out.... then you go in with no expectations!,5,0,1,17 June 2010
The Expendables," Lets not get carried away
","This is an OK movie enjoyed best at the cinemas! I am quite shocked by all the positive comments reffering to this movie as most of them seem to be oblivious to the fact that the storyline is pretty much non existent and the acting, with a couple of exceptions, is quite pathetic.Stallone, I had hoped, would be hanging his action hero tag well and truly over to a younger and far slicker Statham however Sly still is basically the hero and Stathom takes the understudy role and figuratively speaking kicks Stallones ass! Lungren is talentless, Li is poor however underused and for my money becomes the whipping boy of the 'bad-ass' crew. Couture is underused too throughout and as for Austin..... I felt sorry for him as the movie went on as his role was basically grunting and looking tough.As for eye candy....... erm ..... as a Carpenter admirer I felt robbed that she even gets a mention in the credits and I don't know too much about Giselle anyway but she acts tough and goes through a lot.Willis and Arnie are pretty much cameos and even then Arnie never fails to deliver a role which a cardboard cut out could have beaten.This is what I call a high octane, fun and brainless movie. At the time I wrote this review it was in the Top 250 movies of all time according to this site..... I would only put it in my personal Top 250..... and I have only watched about 600 movies! Personally I like to laugh when the plot is so thin and the stunts are soooo over the top.... so for that I rate Knight and Day higher as this movie tries to take itself more seriously and really shouldn't!",7,3,14,13 August 2010
Horrible Bosses," Where did this gem come from?
",For me the stand out movie of the year so far! I don't say that too lightly either with some fantastic competition out there like Hangover 2 and XMen First Class being 2 of my other favourites so far.Horrible Bosses takes an unbelievable storyline and simply makes it hilarious.Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell steal every single scene they are in! I wanted them to be in every scene in fact as they just kept me laughing so much. There are some brilliant moments which left me being shushed in the theatre.Have been back 2 more times to watch and with nothing else taking my fancy this month so far i think I may go back again.... Captain America had better deliver!!,9,2,4,13 August 2011
Avengers: Endgame," Satisfying but let's not go overboard!
",Loved the movie. Something which really frustrates me however is those who come on here and give 10/10 but it's just an over reaction.I don't want to spoil and when talking about Endgame it's hard to not mention elements of the movie. Pretty much every emotion was hit throughout the 3 hours which I must admit seemed to fly by!Something I will say is this...... it's nothing like what I expected.,8,0,2,27 April 2019
