It," Biggest scam since Bernie Madoff
","Oh IMDb, we had a great relationship for many years with no deceptions. Every time the 'should I watch this?' eternal doubt came in, it was a matter of logging in to the IMDb great gods to get the answer. With all this It hype and a 8 star (8!!! Just a reminder: Terminator, Star Wars, Gandhi and Rocky had this rating) that was it. Complete disappointment. Filled with basic American standard jokes, no story (why the hell the clown even existed?), way to much Stranger Things copycat and ridiculous attempts to scare the public, these were the worst 10 bucks spent this year. Please, don't go.",1,4,10,23 September 2017
