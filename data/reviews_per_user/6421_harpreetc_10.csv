Mission: Impossible III," Hopkins should have been called back.
","I think the classy feel of the second was completely lost in this one. Hopkins was sorely missed. Hoffman was a good nemesis, but his calibre was wasted utterly in this movie. He has style, no doubt, villains should always have that, but I was expecting something - well, more! Tom Cruise looks fab, he has hit his 40's with a resounding bang! And I must say, the heroine angle was ludicrous! I mean I can understand the need to be different from Bond and therefore the need for Hunt to actually commit to a woman, but Monaghan is too saccharine sweet and Jamie Lee Curtis did a better job of playing the dumb wife of a double agent in True Lies. Maggie Q - ah - she has something to DO in the movie! Overall, it's cool to watch if you have nothing to kill your time. It's a fast paced movie, thankfully, the editing is superb and one doesn't get bored while watching this action drama.",6,0,0,11 June 2006
Alexander," Nearly as awesome as Alexander.
","Ever since I read 'The Persian Boy' in my teens, I have had an incomparable feeling for Alexander. There was this insatiable need to know all there was to know about Alexander, the Great. Renault did his life justice when she wrote about him in her trilogy ... and after seeing Stone's movie, I believe that he, too, has done his very best in being faithful to the character of one of the greatest of men who ever lived!I think that each character in the movie was very well cast! Jolie was a brilliant Olympias, Kilmer WAS Philip!!! Frankly, Farell would not have been my first choice as Alexander, but he carries off the role with a great deal of responsibility - and a flair that can be seen in -not all but - some scenes. Like the scene with his mother after the assassination of his father! It is a well-grafted scene - but Jolie has outdone herself!Stone has used a lot of salient facts within the movie and THANKFULLY, Alexander's love for Hephaistion has been depicted as it truly was in the annals of history! Unlike the hideous distortion of the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus in Troy, the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion retains its originality! Stone has shown his utter conviction to keep with the truth of history and even shown the relationship between Alexander and his Persian slave, Bogoas. The topic of which was the central theme in Renault's 'The Persian Boy'. Troy seems like a complete farce when compared to this movie!The plot moves at a steady pace and Stone knows just what factors should be engaged in the depiction of the biographical sketch and what factors should be left out. The story of how he tamed the beautiful and spirited Bucephalus, a horse that no one dared to touch or ride is skillfully shown as well as the fact of how this famous steed carried him as far as India, where it died! And then again, his sacking of Thebes has been neglected in the storyline. His annexation of Persia and the battle of Arbela - also known as the battle of Gaugamela - is the highlight of the movie. Though I was saddened about the exclusion of his victory over Tyre which is considered to be his greatest military achievement.Despite the fact that this genre of biographical moviedom caters to the valor and the zeal portrayed by one of the greatest heros that ever lived, there is the infusion of a softness, of aspects of love and of devotion. There is the love between Hephaistion and Alexander, the devotion of Bogoas towards Alexander, and the love-hate relationship between Roxane and Alexander! As I saw the final scenes of Alexander hallucinating in the final stages of malaria, his anguish bound to the ring Hephaistion had given him, I mentally saluted Oliver Stone for creating this movie. For years I have wondered what a movie on Alexander would be like - if it would retain the truth of who and what the man behind the warrior was - and frankly I am very glad that Stone's vision was not too far from mine. I highly recommend this movie to all those who want to know what sort of a person Alexander was - for this is a faithful description. Hats off to you, Mr Stone!",10,2,9,8 December 2004
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," From Hogwarts to Ilvermorny
","Let me begin with a wish: I wish that Alfonso Cuarón had directed this movie – and he would be also allowed to direct all the rest that are to follow. I don't really like David Yates' direction. The movie moves well enough, but there are some cuts and snap tos that I can't seem to digest as well-directed at all. That being said, the movie belongs to Eddie Redmayne. He has pulled off the role of Newton Scamander so well that the errors of direction seem alright.The movie basically deals with Scamander coming in to America to release a thunderbird into the wilds of Arizona. Eddie Redmayne! Thankfully, he was rejected to play Tom Riddle way back in 2002, when he auditioned for the part in the Chamber of Secrets. Or else, casting him here would have been impossible. This man takes acting to a whole different level. He plays the part of Newt like he was born a wizard, attended Hogwarts, was sorted into Hufflepuff, was expelled from the school, and became a Magizoologist. His reticence reaches his eyes all the time. There is a wariness and diffidence that most animal lovers have when dealing with human beings, the attitude which is so deeply imbibed within them which makes them distrust humans, seeing them as beings that debase the environment and massacre other organisms they deem inferior. Eddie imbues all of this within Newt Scamander, with a faultless charm. There couldn't have been a better choice to play this. He is to Newt what Martin Freeman was to Bilbo.Porpentina Goldstein is very well-portrayed by Katherine Waterston. An independent woman who stands up for the downtrodden by breaking rules and therefore loses status at her job which is all about upholding the rules. The magical community doesn't seem to be very lenient when it comes to the law – it literally (and ironically) is Draconian. I draw parallels again: to me, Tina is like Hermione and Newt is like Harry. Porpentina's sister, Queenie, is much like Luna Lovegood, and Jacob Kowalski is much like Ron. So at least in this historical spin-off, Harry and Hermione get together. *wink* Ezra Miller stands out. Maybe because he identifies as queer in real life, he could play this role so vividly. Someone trying to repress who he really is and that leads to his becoming an Obscurial, eventually leading to his detriment. His scenes stand out, parallel to the repressed power of acting shown by the very gifted Samantha Morton.The MACUSA is created beautifully, one thing is for certain: the visual effects team has done a phenomenal job! Each creature has been lovingly crafted. The sheer imaginative genius of J. K. Rowling has to be hailed once again, for thinking up of these creatures in the first place. I still remember reading both 'Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them' and 'Quidditch Through the Ages' so many years ago, and chuckling at her sharp wit and mammoth ingenuity. Now as I see the thunderbird come to life with its six wings, and the beauty of the Occamy slither away after a cockroach, I am awestruck all over again.Each beast – and there are quite a few in the movie – have been devotedly crafted. To match the benevolence and adoration shown to them by Scamander, the visual effects team have done them complete justice. The erumpent is wonderfully funny, the nundu is majestic, the graphorn is grandiose, and the niffler is as immensely lovable as the bowtruckle is endearing. The Swooping Evil is completely contrary to its name. It literally saves the heroine, ensnares the villain and saves the entire magical community from being exposed to the No-Maj world. The movie is about beasts and where to find them, indeed! Which brings me to a different sort of beast: Gillert Grindelwald. All of us who have read the Harry Potter books from front to back, several times, over the years, know who he is. When I read his relationship with Dumbledore, I had cocked my eyebrow on reading about it at several places. Hello, this seems like romantic love, I thought to myself – and sure enough, Rowling mentioned after it all was written and done with, that Dumbledore, my hero, was gay. So Gillert became someone he was in love with – or at least, I believe so. Colin Farrell is good – but there literally is applause in the theater when Johnny Depp is revealed as the true Gillert.But it is in the portrayal of this character, that I find that the film doesn't add up. How has he taken the identity of Percival Graves? Polyjuice? Is Graves dead? Does Grindelwald already have the elder wand when he duels with Porpentina and then Newt? (The exact date when he gets the Elder Wand could be between 1899-1945, so he may not have it in his possession at the time of these duels.) He is 43 years old when the film is set, at the beginning of, if not already at, the height of his power. So why does he require an Obscurus? How will that help him find the Deathly Hallows? I am sure all of this will eventually be explained. But for that we must wait for another two years. And then another two more and then – oh well, you get the drift.Yes, I would recommend the film. It's sluggish in the beginning, and apart from the leads, the rest of the cast seems incompetent in their roles. I would commend it for brilliant visual effects – the beasts are breathtaking, and now you know exactly where to find them.",7,0,2,18 November 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Fantastic!!!
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was fantastic. There are no real endings to the movie, but the movie is still fantastic. It moves at a faster pace than its predecessor. It veers off from the book in more places than one. It is over the top at some points. But. It is fantastic. That being said, I must say the script is well written. Tauriel, who I expected much less of, is surprisingly well developed. Evangeline Lilly has done an excellent job. She is an obvious love interest, but she is much more than another Evening Star. Arwen's strength is of a different nature – Tauriel is more elemental. The digression from the book is not a necessity but I am happy to allow this bit of cinematic license only because it is done so well and it doesn't mess with anything cannon. Forgiven. Gandalf is as usual beyond par. The character and Sir Ian McKellen have nothing but praise to accept. We see a glimpse of the power that the wizard sustains in a duel of strength he has to contend with, and though there are evident imitations of the challenge with the Balrog in the Fellowship, this one sustains its energy and interest. I love the additions despite my penchant for being a pedant. The High Fells of Rhudaur and the subsequent journey, the move into Dol Guldur, which ascertains Sauron's identity, is very well managed. None of which we see in the book but which feature as the Appendices in the Lord of the Rings. Well-written. Thranduil, a Silvan elf from the First Age, is wonderfully played by Lee Pace. We see little of him in the first part, but in this one he holds the character with assurance. I am very glad to see that with him Peter Jackson gets the aspect of the size ratios right. He belittles even Legolas, and that's lovely to see. I expect Galadriel to have the same height. Thorin Oakenshield shows his descent into greed well. As does Martin Freeman with Bilbo's dark attachment to the One. Martin is indubitably the star of the movie, easily holding his own against a stalwart like McKellen and, who cannot mention, Smaug the Magnificent. The dragon is the pièce de résistance. The worm you have waited so long to see. The graphics are mind-blowingly good. The live motion capture from the very villainous Benedict Cumberbatch is astounding. Of course, we deviate again from the book when the dwarfs play hide and seek with Smaug the Golden in the halls of Erebor, but that is just to show how lovely the dragon looks on screen. Forgiven. The story moves fast and the movie gets over too soon. Nothing really ends up happening as such, all the story lines have no endings because naturally we have another part to go through. But I am sure that we shall be seeing the return of the White Council members, Galadriel, Elrond, Radagast, (don't know if they will be showing Gil-Galad or Glorfindel) to fight at Dol Guldur and the Battle of the Five Armies will culminate the movie surely. My favourite scenes? Bilbo climbing through the canopy of trees in Mirkwood and scaring off blue butterflies. Gandalf's duel with Sauron. Thranduil speaking with Thorin. The escape in the barrels to the River Running. Smaug, Smaug, Smaug. I for one thoroughly enjoyed this fare. Shall be seeing it several times more, I am sure, because, have I mentioned this? It is fantastic.",10,5,14,13 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 'Where to begin? Let's seeAh yes'
","I've been waiting since 2003 with a hope that someday Peter Jackson would direct The Hobbit. And nearly a decade after I saw The Return of the King in the theatre, I went back to see Middle-earth on the big screen.Was it worth it? Oh – my – God, yes! Spoiler Alert!The movie begins with 'dear Frodo' and I smiled. Ian Holm is back as the older Bilbo and he rocks the prologue. The tying-up of The Hobbit to LotR begins right here – and it's done so well! The make-up is spectacular. The entry of Frodo brings back wonderful memories and, ironically, it takes you into the future and yet fills you with the wonder of the present. The links between the LotR movies and this one is most prevalent in the scenes with the older Bilbo and Frodo. For instance, links of dialogues like 'dwarf doors are invisible when closed' said by Gandalf – who, pauses and realizes that since he is seated amongst 13 dwarfs it would be quite pertinent not to mention 'even their masters cannot find them'. Or one of the trolls saying, 'make him squeal'. Or Gandalf telling Thorin to not talk at all with the elves and let him do all the talking, just like he did with Pippin in the RotK.Bilbo's prologue takes us to Erebor. The Heart of the Mountain is shown – and it's unlike anything I pictured when I read about it, which doesn't mean that it is bad. It just takes on a different image now in my mind. A quite beautiful one. Thror is resplendently shown – and we get to see Thrain, Thorin and Thranduil all in the flashback. Spectacular halls. Brilliant mines. Magnificent treasure. And the need that arises withing Thror to hoard it all. Possessiveness and greed – which brings me to Smaug, the Magnificent! His arrival is shown very cleverly. A flash of a wing here, a swirl of the tail, a stride of the front legs there – but that is all that Peter Jackson gives us. Sir Ian McKellen carries the role of Gandalf with such élan that a few extra wrinkles can promptly get unnoticed. His acting, comic style, a flair for dialogue rendering make him superlative by default.Which brings me to the younger Bilbo – Martin Freeman. He is just astounding! The role of Bilbo was made for this Free man! I think he has done a truly splendid job. The unsociable, very human Bilbo taking on the mantle of an intrepid adventurer who faces his own fears is amply brought to life by Martin.The dwarfs are introduced well. There are 13 of them and there's no pressure to learn any of their names which is a good move on Jackson's part. Each of them is easily identifiable as different from the other by makeup and prosthesis – my favourite happens to be Balin. Thorin's entry and his personality marks him the Aragorn of The Aragorn of The Hobbit. His is a brooding personality completely befitting Thorin's and he is handsome, as are his nephews, Fili (Dean O'Gorman) and Kili (Aidan Turner). Balin, Dwalin, Fili, Kili and Bofur are given ample screen time. The cinematography and the story boarding are just amazing. Radagast the Brown, quirky, devoted to the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, is brought to life by Sylvester McCoy. I think he did a fantastic job of being the quirky, brave, eccentric passionate lover of nature that Radagast is  I enjoyed his fight with the Witch King at Dol Guldur and quite liked the rabbits from Rhosgobel, too. And yes, they are fast!What is Peter Jackson's own invention is the Morgul blade that Radagast manages to wrestle from the Witch King. But even that fits into the storyline – it is well-woven in. Also the fact that he gives an animal lover like me a chance to sigh with relief. Jackson allows the ponies to go 'missing' before the dwarfs reach Rivendell. I didn't want to see the ponies being taken by the goblins in Moria. Galadriel, Saruman, Elrond and Gandalf have the meeting of the White Councl. Círdan, Glorfindel and Radagast are not shown in the film. Cate Blanchett is a goddess! It is here that Gandalf says the most poignant dialogue in the whole movie about how it is not great power that changes the world but small acts of kindness and love.Apart from tricky action sequences in Goblin town, what is essential and really worthwhile to note is the scene with Gollum and Bilbo. The scene between the two is electrifying. Andy Serkis as Gollum has surpassed himself yet again! The execution of the Riddles in the Dark is amazing. And the finding of the Ring of Power heightens the entire situation to electrifying levels. It is diffused only between what I know now to be my favourite scene of the movie: the point where Bilbo has a choice – to kill Gollum or to spare him. 'The pity of Bilbo will rule the fate of many.' The surrealism of that scene is tackled beautifully.The movie ends with a thrush and the awakening of Smaug – the look of the dragon's head, graphically, was not pleasing, it looked unreal. I hope they rectify this within a year before they show him in full, golden scales and all!10 out of 5.",10,15,31,15 December 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," The rise of the Phoenix.
","Been a fan of the Xmen for a while now. Was mighty glad to see Beast make an appearance in this one! The special effects are awesome in this movie - especially in the scenes with Magneto! I cannot say much without giving away most of the movie, but there are many scenes which are just picked up from the Uncanny Xmen comics and they make the movie all the more entertaining to watch if you are a fan. Famke does a good job in this one, considering she is quite a wooden actress... Halle's winning the Oscar seems to have made her role in the movie quite significant, but that doesn't stop her from getting thrashed by the villains in this one as well. *wink* Ian McKellen is Brilliant!! As always! Somehow villains get the best lines and when Ian uses his intonation and accent they seem surreal! The best scenes to look out for - i feel - is the scene where Magneto rescues Mystique and when he uproots the bridge! And of course, the telekinetic/mental battle between the Phoenix and Xavier! A must watch!!",9,1,3,26 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," The book is better.
","But of course, there is hardly any chance that a movie would be better than the book. There is such a veritable mass of information given in the book, Howard has tried his best to fill that into the movie. The overall perspective is quite clean, to understand the movie one doesn't need to read the book. So that would indicate that the movie has done well in making itself understood to the audience despite the complexity of theme. Ian McKellen shines!!! He is brilliant, but then I always knew he would be. Audrey Tautou warms up in her acting as the movie progresses, but Tom Hanks does nothing to enliven the scenes. I was shocked to see Paul Bettany as Silas. I mean I loved him in Wimbledon!! Here he does a good job but still it was a shocker. :)The Da Vinci Code created a lot of protests in my part of the world, though it was passed through, I really saw no reason for it to create such a furore. I mean, the book merely makes one think - the movie moves too fast for us to think. On the whole, I would see this movie again!",8,0,2,26 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," POA still the best!
","The movie: I would rate it as Good instead of Excellent. I would rate POA excellent! After Alfonso's direction, Mike's direction was back to Chris' structure. The movie was NOT boring...no, not at all... but the book has been chopped away! There is NO quidditch at all - that is played - just the players making an entry. There is no Madness of Mr Crouch, no WINKY! The other champions' games have been snatched away - and Fleur has been made to look quite silly!! She becomes a weeping, hysterical woman in the Maze. I wonder why they did that to her character... (This is all a hotchpotch of my thoughts so bear with me - after 10 hours of being in a theatre it sort of makes me run rampant!) Ah, so where was I?Ah yes!! My favourite scenes: 1. The Unforgivable Curses in Mad-Eye Moody's classroom: It was terrible. I have never felt as sorry for an insect as I did when I was watching those scenes!! Watch out for this one! 2. THE RESURRECTION of Voldemort!!! MAN!!! The entire scene - was spectacular. The special effects were great - but I am not talking about them - R A L P H F I E N N E S ! ! ! He absolutely IS Lord Voldemort!!! The scene of Flesh, Blood and Bone is way out there in the creep out factor - but man! the resurrection and Ralph and then the PRIORI INCANTATEM scene - BLOODY BRILLIANT!It is a fabulous climactic point in the movie.Many scenes are worth noticing - Hermione stands out in the Yule Ball, which is to be expected. And I particularly liked Padma Patil. ;-) The tasks were done well, they should have focused a bit more on some of the other champions instead of just Harry - but I understand about the time factor.I don't understand why Krum had to go all white-eyed after being struck by the Imperius...? I guess it was to make him look sinister and - er, Imperio'ed? Ginny had a few lines to say - the one that left an impact was 'It's ghastly!' The ferret bouncing scene was well done as well. Hehehe. Though why the ferret had to travel down someone else's pants I fail to understand. Hmmmmmmmm. By and large, I think the movie was worth seeing - definitely! But it lacked the utter finesse and polish of Prisoner of Azkaban.",8,0,0,16 December 2005
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Great but could have been greater
","As usual, after a movie Peter Jackson makes on works by Tolkien, I post a small outpouring of my thoughts. This time is no different, though I will be able to get a more definite picture – literally – after I see it a couple of times more. I don't feel like letting go, and though everyone says it's #onelasttime I don't really see the last bit happening. So I am not really sad about it. Especially because I still have the Lord of the Rings to turn to for superlative story telling.There will be spoilers from now on, so if you aren't interested to know plot details please do not read further. Fast, fast, fast does it go, and never a moment's pause in action. It begins with Smaug and that dragon is dispensed with in just about 10 minutes flat, which is pretty awkward and antithetical to all that prosaic dialogue and running around furnaces for what seemed like a long time in the previous part. There is no use of birds except the raven sent to notify Dain Ironfoot. Who by the by has done a good cameo. Everyone seems to be riding animals though: Dain on a wart hog, Thorin on a ram, Thranduil on an elk – hmmmmm. I loved, absolutely loved, the White Council scenes. Galadriel's entry, carrying Gandalf, and finally the using of Nenya, is absolutely glorious! The action scenes are fast and get over all too soon. I loved this scene, have I mentioned? Oh, well, I'll mention it again, I loved it. The Elves are everywhere! Thranduil, Legolas and Tauriel have their parts stretched to suit fandoms everywhere. I am not complaining, but I would have liked to see more Beorn, more eagles, more Gandalf and Radagast, too. Alfrid is given undue weight-age but I suppose it is to prove that not all bad guys get their just desserts, on in this case, they get the desserts they always wanted to have. I liked the dialogues of this part. They have a certain lyricism that reminded me of the Lord of the Rings. The death scenes are handled well, and grief is given its due place in the scheme of this movie and helps pass on age old morals, that do not really seem jaded in these contexts. When Tauriel asks Thranduil, 'why does love hurt so?' and he answers, 'because it is real' – I was moved. Honest, direct and true. No flowery stuff. It kind of sums up what the genre of fantasy means to me . The movie has a faster pace than either of its predecessors. There isn't a moment to take into consideration character movement, unless you take Thorin's descent into madness induced by possessiveness for property and want of power. The scenes flow seamlessly, but too fast, in my opinion. It's almost as if PJ wanted to rush through this one and get it over with. In fact, I think this movie had more places where the scenes could be prolonged, like the epic confrontation between the White Council and Sauron and Beorn's part in the battle of the climax, to name just two that I was really looking forward to seeing. Well, maybe in the Extended Version of the Blu-Ray then. Do I see it again? Of course!!",9,7,21,11 December 2014
300," Sadly, Another Troy.
","The rating is most for the outstanding visuals that take over the entire movie. Apart from the breath-taking lighting and cinematography to the above-average special effects, there is nothing else that I can state that is good about the movie. The acting is average, the direction good, the story - completely, historically and politically incorrect! ***Possible Spoiler warning***Whoever heard about a Xerxes being a black drag queen, wearing Indian jewellery? Good God, I mean, what was the need for being so totally incorrect. The Spartans who were actually the 'boy lovers', use the phrase loosely for the Greeks. While all the Spartans spout is unbridled machismo against a hedonistic and incredibly tall Persian who is nearly effeminate (shaped eyebrows and all) and completely devoid of any traits of a warrior.I hated Troy for being completely different from the Troy that Homer created. As for '300' - I can say that it is a visually spectacular movie - but for me - it was just another Troy. Historically wrong and politically incorrect.",5,13,35,23 March 2007
