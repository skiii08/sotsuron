Casablanca," 'The Original Love Story'
","Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman star in the greatest love story of all time. The unforeseen circumstances for which they fall in love sets the standard and the bar for all romance movies. No one will ever really truly cultivate your feelings of love and compassion like that of this movie. It is truly magnificent to watch the turmoil and decisions that face Bogart throughout the film. You can literally feel Bogart's heart fall onto the table when Bergman is seen at his club in Casablanca and the realism in the film is truly sensational.This movie was one of the first to truthfully portray realism in film and shows the world of realism in fiction. It is exceptionally beautiful how they portrayed that love can come to anyone at anytime in any situation. Sometimes that means everything else doesn't matter.The acting that Bogart and Bergman possess and show while Sam plays their song,it shows you of two lost lovers longing for answers and there will to never give up on each other despite the unforeseen circumstances that have fallen upon them.",10,2,3,2 March 2010
Citizen Kane," Absolutely Mind Bottling
","Orson Welles destroys all competition in this 1941 American drama about a man who had everything in life that most people could want but he couldn't have the things that really mattered. This was based upon the life of William Randolph Hearst. In the movie, Kane spends his whole life and time demanding that people love him and what he is about, but when it comes to the most important things like giving love back the man is lost. The movie was extremely well done in the fact that it was revolutionary for it's time. Kane start's as just a simple man who believes that running a paper would be fun for him and help mend his new life. Throughout the movie, through the reporters eye's you begin to see that as time went on, Kane became hungry for power and it turned into a pursuit of love and fame in which he could give none of it back. No matter how much fortune the man had or could fork out, all anyone wanted him to show was love and he was incapable of doing so.",8,0,1,2 March 2010
Taxi Driver," Scorseses' and Deniro at their very best.
","Scorsese delivers one of the greatest Character studies of all time in this Movie about a marine-veteran who suffers from insomnia and is a very depressed and lonely man who finds comfort in dirty porn theaters. Robert Deniro portrays this character and is phenomenal throughout. Deniro plays a man who seems destined to wipe the street of the scum of the city as he continually gets angrier and angrier and violent even to a point where he shoots a man robbing a store in the back of the head without remorse. After this, Deniro becomes more and more sick of what he sees and hears in his cab in everyday life like Robberies, prostitution and drugs and decides he is destined to end it in his own way. Scorsese does this by adding a 12 yr old prostitute in which Deniro takes a liking to. He pays her to get the time to talk to her so he can try and help return her to her parents and ordinary childhood life. Scorsese's pure brilliance and directing are trademark to what this film was. A study of a man who is utterly disgusted with the way the world is and confused in which way he fits in the world. I believe taxi driver is one of the ten greatest movies of all time because of the versimiltude and realism it brings to the table. Taxi Driver tackles the issue of a man trying to find out who he is and what he can do for the world that seems to suffer around him.",10,0,0,27 April 2010
Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick is Pure Genius
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job of creating an aggressive beginning to the movie. The constant abuse of Gomer Pyle by Sergeant Hartman felt real and the versimilitude in the movie was frightening. The film also carried some of the greatest scenes in history. The scene between Pyle and Joker which awoke Sgt. Hartman was intense,raw and the words 'Full metal jacket' will forever ring in the back of my mind. It also opened the eyes to the world of what an abusive drill instructor could do and what it could lead you to do.The other scene that was horrifying and the realism of the hazing of Pyle was as if you were there witnessing as a bystander. Kubrick did a terrific job of filming that scene and showing you the angst of Joker as he reluctantly gets in on the action. I feel like Stanley Kubrick attempted and completed in showing you what the Vietnam war could do to a average normal person and the aftermath of what a war like that could do.",10,1,1,11 May 2010
Fargo," Coen Brothers at its best
","The Coen Brothers go along way to catch the essence of what life is like in a town without much crime or power. The acting is flawless with Frances Mcdormand leading the way as a pregnant police chief who is smart enough to see that something out of the ordinary is happening in the country parts of Minnesota. The whole way that the Coen's had Mcdormand and her partner access the murders and go about finding out more about it is absolutely hysterical. I am from Minnesota and many of the characters sounded a lot like the cousins and grandparents I have in the country in Minnesota. The 'you betchas' and other lines are key to the realism of the film. I truly appreciate the most important part of the film though. The versimilitude and the ability of the Coen Brothers to go to extreme lengths just to show you, that in life in order to be happy and satisfied sometimes you just have to be grateful for what you have. That is why the downfall of the car salesman played by William H. Macy is so disturbing because all he had to do was ask for help and be grateful for the family that was left for him at home. The atmosphere and the depth of shots to show you the wilderness of Minnesota is breathtaking and at times you can almost feel the breeze of the cold Minnesota winter as the movie carries from scene to scene. Overall, this was one hell of a Coen Brothers film and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark American comedy.",8,0,0,6 May 2010
Apocalypse Now," Changed how people looked at the Vietnam war
","The opening scene of this movie is truly one of the greatest of all time. The score of 'This is the End' by the doors tells a story of a man who is at war within himself and believes that time for him may in fact be coming to an end. The Fading in and out of the character as you sink into his mind and thoughts is maginificent. Coppola does an amazing job with the fades of showing you the thoughts and aspirations or fears of a man in a war, he really doesn't enjoy being in. All of this is shown in one scene. Showing just how far of the lengths Coppola went to show the pain and endearing it took a person during the war in Vietnam. Coppola wanted you to be aware of the sense of the horror, madness and the overall moral dilemma of soldiers in the Vietnam war. The film depicts a group of U.S assassins and soldiers that need to clear out a former Colonel of the AWOL and while doing this they deal with the trials and tribulations of being a soldier at the same time. I feel that at times Coppola made the movie the way it is to not only show you what was happening in Vietnam but to have you visually absorb the feelings of the people as they forego on one of the most physically and mentally challenging mission anyone could imagine.",10,0,1,6 May 2010
The Exorcist," Horror movie classic
","I am a not of fan of horror movies so this was not the easiest movie to watch.It was a very disturbing movie for its time and still is pretty disturbing now.I feel like it had to do a lot with the questions of god vs. evil and god vs. Satan and it completely opened the world eyes to what exorcism and if it is or isn't real.I think its one of the truly greatest horror films because it pushed the envelope of what is a horror movie. It is constantly tests your mind and tampers with your thoughts to try and make you see what they want you to see. It also brings about the question of whether there is a god or divine power out there and I find that very fascinating because I tend to question that all the time. The score at the end of the movie when the demon possesses the little girl and then the priest was intense and disturbing and showed a new side of horror never seen before.Overall, it was just a really disturbing and scary movie.",7,2,4,11 May 2010
The Graduate," 'Mrs Robinson are you trying to seduce me?'
","I watched this movie in my history of American cinema course and it was by far the most enjoyable film of the class. Dustin Hoffmann is as good as it gets in this 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols. Hoffmann does an amazing job of showing you what it was like for a college graduate who never really got to 'live' during his college years. A truly great coming to age story and honestly now one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Anne Bancroft who plays the seductive wife of Braddock's fathers partner in business gives a performance for a woman that had not really seen before because of the stupid hays code. The use of cutting and ellipsis are displayed perfectly from frame to frame and adds a whole new dimension to the film. The use of the song 'sounds of silence' is very key to the movie. It sets the tone for the movie and ends it perfectly, in both turns it signifies how in life, sometimes you lose the way of things and your stuck in silence trying to peace back what once was your dreams and ambitions.",10,1,1,10 April 2010
