Scarface," A Classic
","I LOVE this movie!!!!!! This movie is a classic. Being a Cuban born in Miami who has parents that lived through this, I have to say this movie was actually pretty accurate. Aside from Al Pacino not being Cuban, even though his accent was exaggerated it was pretty accurate as well. This movie is slow in parts and fast in others and can be a little annoying at times. Al Pacino played this part wonderfully. I gave this movie a 9/10, because there is still room for improvement by today's standards. The only way I feel this movie could have been better is if Tony Montana went to Cuba and killed Fidel Castro himself.
This is off topic from what i was saying before but this movie is a true action movie, it almost got an X rating, because of the violence, especially the scene in the bathroom where they are chopping up Chico with the chainsaw. They had to delete the showing of sawing off his arms and legs, because it was too much, they didn't even include it in the deleted scenes. I highly recommend this movie if your a history and action movie person.",9,0,0,28 April 2020
