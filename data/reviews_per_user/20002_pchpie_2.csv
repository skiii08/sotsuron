Catch Me If You Can," an afternoon delight!
","i enjoyed this film so much!  decaprio, hanks, walken, sheen (with the buck teeth), the direction, the sets, the costumes, the music, the opening title sequence, the 'feel'...so very cool, a wonderful way to while away a chilly saturday afternoon.  and so very funny...a perfect little piece of art. go see this movie!",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback Mountain Broke My Heart
","I saw this movie Friday. It is now Sunday, and I am still consumed with thoughts and feelings about the story, the acting, the directing, the cinematography. So much is going on here that perhaps may have gone unnoticed by a younger audience (I'm 56)...the poverty from childhood on (even for Jack as evidenced by his sparse bedroom), Ennis's lack of education, the terrible parenting (particularly by Ennis's father), dying young without realizing your dreams, living on with the regret and loneliness, the trap that these men were in, and the hurt/heartbreak of the women who loved them.Heath was astounding, but Jake's Jack was so terribly wonderful as well. And the two of them playing off each other..incredible. Also, Michelle...the three blew me away, and if each doesn't win their respective Oscars, they will have been robbed.I have been a movie buff for 35 years. This was a movie as affecting it its own right as a 'doomed' love story as any I've ever seen, including Gone with the Wind. It broke my heart, but it will go down as one of my very favorites for the rest of my life.",10,10,12,8 January 2006
