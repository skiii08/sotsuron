Walk the Line," absolutely amazing
","This is probably one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It tells the story of country music legend Johnny Cash (a man whose music I in all honesty don't particularly care for) from his traumatic childhood to his successful career in the music industry and ultimately his love for June Carter.The story itself is mesmerizing. The script is well written and the characters well portrayed. Joaquin Phoenix was convincing as the Man in Black and Reese Witherspoon was amazing! She definitely deserved the Oscar. I was really impressed by the fact that she and Joaquin did their own singing.Another thing, I actually found myself tapping along to the beat, and I'm not even a fan. All in all a fantastic movie, an easy 10/10.",10,1,2,14 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Jack Sparrow does it again!
","Pirates 2 was given mixed reviews. Some (usually die hard Pirates fans like myself) loved it while others found it only 'ok'. I was among those who loved every second of it and at the end wanted more.Once again Johnny Depp was brilliant as Captain Jack Sparrow. Someone commented that only Depp could pull off a role as whacky as Jack and that person is absolutely right! He has the charisma, the look, even the gait of Jack. He is absolutely hilarious, I laughed the entire time.Not only was Depp's acting fantastic, Orlando Bloom proved that he will not only be known as the elf in Lord of the Rings. Keira Knightly also did a decent job, she has guts, unlike most heroines in fantasy/adventure films. And the two former crew members of Captain Barbossa were a nice touch, though not quite as funny as they were in Black Pearl, they still sneaked in a few funny one liners.The effects were fantastic, but what would one expect from Jerry Bruckheimer? The story was clever too. Usually I am not a fan of sequels because they usually end up being sub par compared to the original. With Dead Man's Chest, I actually found the sequel as entertaining, if not more, than the original. The ending was quite a surprise, I don't want to spoil it on anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but let's just say a person you would least expect comes to the rescue.All in all a fantastic movie and I can't wait for the third one!! Easy 10/10",10,3,6,2 August 2006
Brokeback Mountain," wonderful love story
","This movie was absolutely amazing! It was very powerful and emotional, one of the most moving films of the year.It's basically a love story, featuring cowhand Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) and aspiring rodeo cowboy Jack Swift (played surprisingly well by Jake Gyllenhaal). The pair meet while herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming.No surprise, Ennis and Jack hit it off and soon fall in love. Unfortunately, Ennis is engaged to be married. They decide that whatever happens at Brokeback stays at Brokeback and the two part ways in the fall.Of course, every story has a catch, and Ennis's now wife, Alma (played wonderfully by Michelle Williams, another surprise. Who knew the gal from Dawson's Creek could act?)catches her husband kissing his fishing buddy outside. (Of course, Jack drops by for a visit but he and Ennis can't wait five minutes to get a room.) Alma is hurt and after a surprisingly long while, files for divorce. Who could blame her? I'd be angry if I caught my husband kissing another man.Then there's more trouble in paradise, when Jack marries the daughter of a rich businessman. So the two meet for more 'fishing trips' on Brokeback Mountain.I was very surprised about the film, I was told that it was disgusting but other than one gay sex scene in the boys' tent, it was not really all that explicit. The scenery was fantastic (I think it was shot in BC) and the music was beautiful. It was very thought provoking and definitely made you think. It was also very sad, as told in the last scene when Ennis is holding Jack's shirt at home, after his daughter told Ennis she was getting married.All in all it was a wonderful film, but not for those who are faint of heart or who only want to see Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have gay sex. An easy 10/10!!!",10,23,27,5 May 2006
Transformers," Wicked film, way better than I expected
","Yeah, I've commented on movies on IMDb a lot, and I usually give them a ten, and this one is no exception. This is another gem that I wasn't all that certain would be good until the first scene, and then WHAM you are hooked! The movie is roughly about the Transformers, technically called Autobots, who are trying to save Earth from the Decepticons, which obviously are the evil version of these machines. From the name Autobot, you can tell that these Transformers do transform into cars, among them the beat up old Camero bought by sixteen year old Sam Witwicky. Anyway, Sam has this peculiar object that the Autobots require in order to save the planet from certain destruction so the geeky teen is recruited to help save humankind from the Decepticons.As mentioned earlier, I absolutely loved this movie. It has the perfect combination of humour, romance, and awesome action, the effects were very well done (was impressed that a movie as far fetched and ridiculous as a bunch of transforming cars actually seemed almost believable) and was at the edge of my seat the entire time (when I wasn't laughing or even almost crying, but I won't go into any other details, I don't want to spoil it for anyone else). Shia LaBeouf is a very talented young man, very fresh and sweet. An easy ten even if you are not into transforming robots.",10,5,8,22 August 2007
Million Dollar Baby," fantastic film, one of Eastwood's finest
","Million Dollar Baby was a beautiful film. It tells the story of an aspiring boxer named Maggie Fitzgerrald (Hillary Swank) and the man who doesn't want to train a woman (Eastwood). During most of the film, Eastwood basically has nothing to do with her but in spite of this a relationship develops and before long, Frankie takes Maggie under his wing.Of course Maggie becomes an excellent boxer, thanks to Frankie and a lot of natural talent. But one match changes everything.This was a fantastic movie. Paul Haggis is a wonderful writer (it's cool to see a Candadian win an Oscar for writing two years in a row!). Eastwood's performance was amazing, as was Swank's and Morgan Freeman's scene with the cheeseburger was priceless! Nice touch, Clint. You put two old pros like Eastwood and Freeman together and you can't lose.",10,3,6,19 May 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," touching... absolutely wonderful
","Stranger Than Fiction was a brilliant film, full of heart and character. I've been a fan of Will Ferrell's since I saw Elf a few years back, and as corny as that film was, I was hooked with the sincerity of his performance.This film was no exception regarding Ferrell's talent. I read a comment on this film in which Ferrell was criticized as being weak, but I thought his acting was some of the best I have seen. It proved that he can do a lot more than make us laugh, but he can touch our hearts as well.I don't want to give the film away for those who haven't seen it yet, but basically it's about an IRS agent named Harrold Crick who is stalked by the voice of a strange woman (Emma Thompson) who ends up being a famous author who just happens to have writer's block. The only trouble is she has a habit of killing off her heroes, and Harrold Crick just happens to be the same man in her story. I won't say much else, but I will tell you that you will laugh, you will cry, and you will be very touched. The acting is great, especially on the part of Maggie Gyllenhaal, whom I never saw act before but now really enjoy, as well as Dustin Hoffman, who is one of my favorites. I agree that there may be some Oscar Buzz concerning this film! All in all, a beautiful film with a touching story and wonderful acting. An easy 10/10",10,1,6,19 November 2006
The Green Mile," Brilliant film, one of my favorites
","Yes, it has been at least seven years since I saw this film, long before I even had access to my own computer, so this review is a bit late (but better late than never!) As stated in the summary, The Green Mile is a brilliant film directed by Frank Darabont, of Shawshank Redemption fame. Set in 1935 Mississippi (namely the Green Mile, a play on the term Last Mile because of the fact that the floor is the colour of 'tired old limes') The Green Mile tells the story of head prison guard Paul Edgecombe and his life as 'bull goose screw' of the Mile. The movie (which is EXTREMELY accurate to Stephen King's novel except for a few minor details)is narrated by a VERY elderly Paul, who is writing his memoirs of his time on the Mile. From the early days on the mile, to the arrivals of the delightful (despite the terrible crimes he committed) Eduard Delacroix, out of control William 'Wild Bill Wharton' and the central character, the mysterious John Coffey, and a tiny mouse named Mr. Jingles, the viewer sees it all, and is actually taken on a trip back in time to the dank cell block which houses these condemned men and the notorious Old Sparkey (no need to explain what that is).The acting in this film is superb, from Tom Hanks as Edgecombe (though Hanks never disappoints in my personal opinion) to Doug Hutchinson, who plays the arrogant, foolish and very detestable Percy Wetmore. When watching Hutchinson, one can just see meanness oozing from his pores. The piece de resistance, however, is the performance of Michael Clark Duncan, who plays Coffey. Duncan is absolutely brilliant, showing (as one person had previously commented) how a man of such size can be a helpless, lost, almost catatonic figure who can at times light up like an innocent child at certain times in the movie (I won't go any further than that in case there are still a few people who have not yet seen this film).The directing is also well done, from the shots of scenic Georgia Pines Nursing Home to the dank, chilling cell block where most of the story takes place, Darabont takes you on a journey through time, just as Paul does in the memoirs he is penning. My verdict? One of the best films in a long time, my favorite Stephen King adaptation (the book was also my favorite by King) and definitely worth watching even eight or nine years after it was released. How this movie was snubbed at the Oscars that year I will never fully understand (especially the Best Supporting Actor nod for Michael Clark Duncan). An easy ten.",10,0,2,4 January 2008
WALL·E," beautiful story of love among the ruins
","This, I believe, has to be one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen. Wall-E took my breath away, from the beautiful animation, to the simple yet perfect soundtrack to Hello Dolly! to the heartwarming love story between a simple robot whose daily routine consists of gathering garbage into little cubes and stacking them neatly aside.Wall-E tells the story of a lonely robot who longs for the love he sees in his favorite movie, Hello Dolly. His life is dull, lonely and repetitive until the beautiful Eve enters the picture. Wall-E is at first frightened and intrigued by Eve, but as their friendship progresses, he finally begins to experience the love he has always longed for.For starters, the visuals were breathtaking. From the bright colours of outer space to the dull grays of a planet overrun with garbage to the green of the one bit of vegetation to survive are astounding. There is little dialogue in the beginning except 'Wall-eeeee...' and 'Ev-a!' but the viewer doesn't seem to notice or care, the story is just that amazing.And then there is the story itself. A lonely robot obsessed with the Broadway musical Hello Dolly finds his own true love, and goes as far as outer space to bring her home, it is quite romantic! I love the concept of love among the ruins of what used to be Earth. And the ending, though I won't give it away, is just wonderfully done.It's funny, cute, beautiful, heart breaking...Wall-E is definitely a must see, I'm giving it 10/10",10,0,2,2 December 2008
