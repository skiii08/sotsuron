Sucker Punch," So Deep and Amazing Graphics!
","I watched Sucker Punch recently and absolutely fell in love with the concept. Baby Doll suffered dissociative identity disorder and would send her mind to another reality to escape the hell she was living in. There is also controversy that Sweet Pea is an alter of Baby Doll, and in the end as Sweet Pea leaves to safety (her mind has left the world) Baby Doll still in the present, being lobotomized, and trapped (she was the human sacrifice). Just goes to show you that deep-thinking movies like these never have a definite answer, leaving the watcher to think for themselves. That was all Sucker Punch. The graphics are so intricate and I love how in Baby Doll's dreams, there is never any blood. It's either smoke, light, etc. which I thought was very creative on Snyder's part.The only complaint I have is it's too condensed. There is such a deep meaning that the movie could go on and on and explain the concept further. But because it's condensed in under 2 hours, you really need to pay attention or you'll miss the slightest of detail.",9,4,7,16 May 2017
