Catch Me If You Can," Great to watch, unbelievable that it really happened.
","This movie was a joy to watch! I usually skip LdC movies, but this was the only one left to watch at the cinema.The fact that the movie is based on a real story makes it even more impressive, and I must say that Leonardo is quite convincing in his role. I'd have liked to see more background on his dad though, as his short-term past sort of remains a mystery.Very enjoyable, even for non-Leonardo fans!",Null,0,1,26 February 2003
The Ring," Great movie
","This movie, in my opinion, was very good. It was intense all the way from the start to the finish. While there were few 'shock'-moments, I expected one all through the film, adding enormously to the atmosphere of fear.I enjoyed watching this film more than I enjoyed watching 'Signs' although I went to the theater thinking these film to be quite a lot alike. The overall story and tension are just much better in 'The Ring'.The only thing that's a shame about the film is that the credits start rolling so soon after the end of the movie. Go see it, and you'll see what I mean.",Null,1,1,24 February 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Ahoy there, matey!
","Wow, went to see this movie, and afterwards I was in a very piratey mood. This movie is a stunning example of an Indiana Jones-like adventure movie. It has action, humor, sexy ladies and a fun plot to boot.
The actors play their parts very well, with Mr Depp putting on a really fine performance. Orlando Bloom also does very well, and I hope to see him in more movies soon.It seems that the costumes and flags are also historically accurate, or so a UK army buddy told me.Anyways, go see it, it's fun. Bring yer girlfriend and yer gold, and ye'll have a good time!",10,0,1,21 August 2003
28 Days Later...," Good movie, bad ending
","This movie should probably not be classed as a horror movie. Although there is some 'bloody' makeup, I didn't notice limbs being torn off, people being decapitated, or anything really gory. A medical friend of mine tells me that virusses do not spread so quickly, but hey, it adds pace to the film, which is a good thing. The film is never boring and the acting is rather good. Apart from some things that were obviously fake (or looked enormously fake), the empty look of England was a stunning feat.Too bad the end seemed to be rushed a bit.",Null,0,0,27 April 2003
Black Hawk Down," After seeing this, you wonder why people do it
","This movie got to me. At the beginning it all seems to be a standard war movie, but once you get halfway it turns grim. The characters are well worked-out, I could identify with most of them, and every death/wounding felt sort of personal. I started to wonder why people do this to each other.I didn't watch the movie at the cinema, because after 'Behind Enemy Lines' I didn't feel like seeing another American propaganda film, but now it seems I should have gone. This movie shows that even Americans are mortal, and that when things go badly wrong they also can use help from other countries. In that way the movie was quite refreshing.There are some graphically gory bits in the movie, but not too many, and most of them are over before your mind registers them properly.Some bits of the movie seemed a bit unrealistic, with soldiers walking upright with bullets digging into the dirt all around them, but hey, there are probably people out there who would do that.At first it seems that keeping up with 4 or 5 different parties in one movie could get too much, but due to the great directing and editing the story is easy to follow.I suggest people go and see this movie if they think war is a bloodless game. Other people should also go see it, because it's a good movie.",Null,0,0,20 March 2003
