Raiders of the Lost Ark," i love this movie!!!
","i love this film so much. it will make you Scream, Cry, Laugh, Cheer, and jump up and down... and thats just the first 10 minuets! i have watched this movie on a TV, a computer, a ipod, the list goes on.i can not believe this movie is 2 hours, it feels like half an hour. and it give you the satisfaction of a 3 hour movie! it makes adults feel like kids, it makes kids feel like Indiana Jones, and it makes Indiana Jones feel... well, who's better than Indiana Jones? i don't know what makes this film so good, but i know when indy puts that hat on... it can't be good for the Nazis.in other words it was okay :)",9,0,1,27 February 2008
