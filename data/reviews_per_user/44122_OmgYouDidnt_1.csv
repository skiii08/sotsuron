Resident Evil: Afterlife," Short Quick Review
","Good for the Friday night, a lot of time and effort went into this as you will be able to see from the very 1st scene.Pros: The usual amazing metal techno soundtrack, kick ass moves, no long boring scenes which take forever.Cons: Seemed to end abruptly when it seemed it should have had an extra 20 mins, slow motion scenes seem to appear too frequently and somehow spoil certain fight scenes.All in all, definitely go to see it if you are a fan of the series. If you have not seen previous instalments, it may be a little confusing, but will still enjoy it as the start explains the story very shortly.",9,32,68,10 September 2010
