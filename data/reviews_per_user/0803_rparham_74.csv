The New World," A rather lifeless 'World'
","Terrence Malick's The New World is a sumptuous looking motion picture, full of natural beauty and what is by far the most believable depiction of what the world of America might have been like in 1602 Virginia when the first European colonists arrived to form Jamestown. However, as gorgeous as The New World is, it is also a rather empty film for most of it's running time, featuring actors who are supposed to be characters but end up as just ciphers and we are left looking at beautiful imagery representing very little.As stated above, The New World is set at the landing of the European's on Virginia's shores. Among them is John Smith (Colin Farrell) who is in the ship's hold and about to be hanged upon landing for mutinous statements. The colony's governor (Christopher Plummer) spares his life, however, and sets him on a mission to develop a relationship with the local Native Americans, referred to here as 'Naturals.' Smith is captured by the naturals and brought before their chief, Powhatan (August Schellenberg), who plans to take his life as part of a plan to drive the settlers from their shores. Smith's life is saved by Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher), and she and Smith eventually fall in love. Powhatan later releases Smith to return to Jamestown, with the intention of the settlers departing, but Smith and his people stay, and are supported through the efforts of Pocahontas, who gives them food and supplies. In the process, she angers her father, who disowns her and she quickly finds herself stranded by her love also, when Smith, ambivalent about their relationship, departs for a new expedition and leads her to believe that he has died. Grief stricken, she is eventually rescued from her woe by tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale), who, while less flashy and instinctive than Smith, shows her love and companionship.The above description is actually pieced together from a variety of sources, since if you just watch the film, you would not be sure if Pocahontas was really in love with Smith, that John Rolfe was named John Rolfe and that Pocahontas was ever named Pocahontas (she is referred to later in the film by her English name, Rebecca). Malick has produced a film that is long on pretty pictures and short on dialogue and character development. I applaud him to a certain extent for being willing to tell a story through mostly imagery, letting events unfold by way of his pictures, something not every director is skilled at. Most of the narrative is discernible from the string of images, but what is missing are the people at the center of the story. Smith is little more than a grungy guy who falls for the natural way of life and spends a lot of time frolicking in the fields with Pocahontas. Pocahontas is a playful girl who likes holding John Smith's hand and later appears rather distraught at his loss. Yes, I can discern the basics from the character's faces, but that doesn't make them people to me. These aren't characters, they are just bodies wandering through the camera's range. When dialogue is uttered, it is often rather hushed and indecipherable. At some instances when the naturals speak to each other in their native tongue, when the subtitles pop up on screen I swear that there was actually no dialogue spoken on screen.Malick substitutes some of the dialogue for long, whispery monologues that are supposed to represent the character's thoughts, but these are also often difficult to make-out, and occasionally are rather pretentious. Smith rambles on about how the new world represents a new beginning for people in one segment and manages to use about every example he can find to describe how people can start over on this new continent. I got the point long before Smith stops talking. Towards the end of the film, the relationship between Pocahontas and Rolfe does develop some tenderness, but that is only in the last fifteen minutes; before that, I don't know if I really cared. Pocahontas finds it difficult to lover her new companion when she still feels deeply for Smith, but we as an audience can't begin to relate, because their relationship had no chemistry, no passion, no life.Malick's film is, indeed, an absolute treasure trove of imagery that is awesome. It could almost pass for a documentary of what life at that time would have felt like. This is no Hollywood set, it has all the verisimilitude of the real world, and for that alone, for those who are interested, it is worth a look. Malick even seems to rely on very little visual effects. There are no elaborate panoramas, no matte paintings or CGI. This is all mostly what the camera can see, and it helps immeasurably to maintain the illusion of reality. For those, like me, who often wonder what is what like to live in the past, The New World is the closest I have ever come to really experiencing it.I have never seen one of Malick's other films, but based on what I have read, the flaws are the same in The New World as any other film in his oeuvre. Many can appreciate his unique contribution to film-making, and I don't believe that The New World is without merit. But I also believe that the best films, usually, are about characters, and that is what is missing here, so Malick's treatise on the founding of America is, in the end, beautiful imagery that is hollow at the core.",6,1,5,13 February 2006
The Incredible Hulk," This Hulk not exactly Incredible, but decent
","Marvel isn't one to let lackluster box-office and mixed reviews keep a good superhero franchise down. In the case of the the Hulk, one of their flagship characters, Ang Lee's 2003 film proved to not be the potent blockbuster they were after, so, five years later, Marvel has rebooted the character with The Incredible Hulk, featuring none of the cast or creative principals of the previous entry. So, what is the verdict of this do-over: a decent entry, featuring more action than the previous film, but not quite as deep in regards to character development.The Incredible Hulk opens with a title sequence that wipes the memories of the first film completely away, re-establishing the origin story, albeit in a more compressed form. The film proper then opens in Brazil, where Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is hiding from the government agents that are attempting to locate him. Bruce, it seems, has used himself as a guinea pig for a super-soldier serum, which, when his heart rate goes too high, leads to him transforming into a not-so-jolly green giant. While dodging the head of the super solider project, General Ross (William Hurt), Bruce is attempting to cure himself, with help from an unseen ally he communicates with over computer named Mr. Blue.After an accident at a soda bottling factory leads Ross to him, Bruce goes on the run, returning to the US and seeking out his lost love Betty (Liv Tyler), while being tracked by Ross's chief lieutenant, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), who has volunteered to also take some of the super soldier serum to attempt to beat the Hulk at his own game, but quickly becomes addicted to the serum, and leads to him seeking more and more, with possibly disastrous results.One thing was certain with this version of the Hulk, and that was that action, lacking in the first film, was to be more of a priority, and, for the most part, The Incredible Hulk delivers. There are no less than three major action sequences in the film, and each is reasonably well done, delivering decent thrills and energy. The Hulk, once again computer generated, is sufficiently convincing, a bit beefier and more muscular than the 2003 version.While the action has been ratcheted up, the attention to character detail has been scaled back a degree or so. The romance is there between Bruce and Betty in the script, but their chemistry is mostly dead. The friction between her and her father also rings a bit hollow, and the face off between Bruce and Blonsky is almost exclusively physical, with no deeper level to it. While those searching for more fisticuffs will be pleased, anyone interested in greater depth to the proceedings will find The Incredible Hulk a bit lacking.The Incredible Hulk boasts a strong cast, but they are used with mixed results. Edward Norton takes over the role of Bruce Banner from Eric Bana, but there is no real shift in quality. Norton delivers a good performance, but nothing exceptional. Liv Tyler is a step down from Jennifer Connolly's turn in the first film, not tremendously convincing as Betty. William Hurt doesn't give the best of performances as General Ross either, over the top in the wrong kind of way. Tim Roth gives another effective villainous turn as Emil Blonsky.The Incredible Hulk proves to be a good comic book film, but not pushing the envelope at all. Marvel has proved that they can turn a lackluster showing of a character around by starting over, but it remains to be seen if this incarnation of the Hulk will be back for a second round. If you are looking for some well-done comic book action and decent special effects, then The Incredible Hulk will deliver the goods. If you want a film that stretches the boundaries of the the comic book film, then look to Iron Man, The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2.",7,3,6,27 November 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Accepting this Mission is fun
","To find a sequel that is the equal, or even superior, to the original is almost unheard of in movies. A second sequel that is not a precipitous drop in quality from the first two is a near impossibility (although summer 2006 has already bucked that curve once with X-Men: The Last Stand). So imagine the surprise when Mission: Impossible III proves to be the strongest entry in that series to date. By no means any masterpiece, complete with it's share of flaws, M:I III nonetheless proves an enjoyable action romp for it's two hour running time.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has left field duty in the IMF to train incoming recruits and is preparing to marry Julia (Michelle Monaghan) when an agent he trained, Farris (Keri Russell), is kidnapped and tortured while trailing a black-market arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Hunt leads the rescue mission, complete with fellow returning team member Luther Stickel (Ving Rhames), and the outcome of that operation leads to a plan to kidnap Davian himself before he can complete his next major arms transaction, involving something called the Rabbit's Foot.Mission: Impossible III is not the most original of concoctions. The film at times plays like a mixture of the first two films, hitting similar beats in both (double-crossing, agents on the run from their own agency, outrageous action set-pieces), but director J.J. Abrams, executive producer of television's current mega-hit Lost, manages to assemble everything in an entertaining package. For one, the film scales back the over-the-top nature of M:I 2, which was a John Woo super-action fantasy, bringing down the number of times the audience is liable to stare wild-eyed at the film with incredulity. He and screenwriters Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman also do a good job of managing to integrate the team-based mentality of the original series that was somewhat missing from both the first and second films. For the first time, the secondary players, especially Rhames, feel like they have more than just walk on roles. Sure, the film won't win any awards for character development, but at least the rest of the IMF squad proves to be more than background window dressing for once.Fans of the original series may still be a little disappointed that M:I III is a bit more of an action movie than the original series ever was. Mission: Impossible always was a guessing game, twisting labyrinthine plots to confound an opponent to eventually steal something or obtain information. Here, it's more about suiting up with a whole lot of guns and fighting your way clear of the bad guys. Even so, M: I III emulates the original series better than either of the first two films, and when it does go into full action-film mode, it delivers entertaining action. The set-pieces are more involving than most in an action film for some time, and you can find yourself getting caught up in the events on screen more often than not. Some of that is due to the fact that M:I III has a bit more depth to it than the first two films. Ethan Hunt is still a bit of a cipher, there isn't a tremendous amount to him, but his relationship with Julia humanizes him a bit more than in previous films. Their relationship is a few notches below convincing; they have some nice scenes together, but there isn't enough screen time for it to get us quite as attached to them as the film would like, but there is more to it than Ethan and Nyah's affair in M:I 2, which for a high-octane summer blockbuster is surprising.One of M:I III's strongest assets is Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role of Davian. Even with limited screen time, Hoffman manages to create a despicable villain you are thoroughly disgusted with. He gives Davian such an air of malicious self-centeredness (he arranges for the deaths of untold hundreds, thousands, perhaps millions, yet he is outraged by Hunt's persecution of him) that you can't wait to see his come-uppance. The rest of the cast is capable, and Cruise is strong as usual. His personal life has turned audiences away from him to some degree, yet if you can ignore the baggage he brings, he still a more than capable performer. Ving Rhames is given the most to do in any of the Mission: Impossible films to date, and his scenes with Cruise where they have the appearance of a friendship occasionally makes you wish the Mission: Impossible films were a little more consistent and had managed to develop this relationship in previous films. Here it feels, perhaps not tacked on, but a bit out of left field.M:I III does manage to fall into the trap of many modern films in the last several years in that it must involve a 'twist' to it's plot. Surprise twists are not a bad thing, but they have become such a stock element in recent years as to become expected and you end up spending your time searching out the film for clues as to what the twist will be, and usually the filmmakers telegraph it far in advance. Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman are a little better at managing this aspect than other movies, but even so, it would occasionally be nice to see a film play straight with it's audience, or at least cover it's tracks a little better.Still, all things being even, M:I III is an enjoyable entertainment that does it's job of providing appropriate excitement for it's running length and not leaving too much disappointment in it's wake. It won't take the world by storm, but not every film has to. If the filmmakers could manage to make another entry as entertaining as this one, an M:I IV wouldn't be a bad prospect.",7,0,0,21 July 2006
Sucker Punch," Visuals in search of a reason to be
","It is a bit amusing, when you think about it, that the first film from director Zack Snyder that is not an adaptation of another medium or a remake is easily his worst film to date. The film in question is Sucker Punch, and it is the ultimate embodiment of what people have complained about much of today's cinema: it is a good looking, painstakingly designed and visually realized film that is almost completely hollow at its core.The plot of Sucker Punch, what there is of one, focuses on Baby Doll (Emily Browning), who has been through some traumatic experiences recently. Her mother has died, leaving her and her sister in the clutches of their abusive and self-absorbed step-father (Does Hollywood ever portray step-fathers any other way?). When an accident claims Baby Doll's sisters' life, the circumstances are made to appear as if Baby Doll did the deed, so her step-father has her committed to a mental hospital where he has arranged for her to be lobotomized in a few days. Once she is incarcerated in the hospital, she imagines her situation in a fantasy environment, where she and her fellow inmates, including Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung), are dancers in a strip club run by the malevolent Blue (Oscar Issac) who are forced to perform for customers and Blue plans to deliver Baby Doll into the hands of the High Roller (Jon Hamm) by the end of the week. To escape this situation, Baby Doll hatches a plan to steal several items they need (a key, a weapon, etc.) from the facility, and to facilitate these thefts without garnering the attention of the staff, Baby Doll distracts the club staff by performing her dancing routine, during which we are shown yet another level of fantasy in which Baby Doll and her compatriots are super-women, capable of all kinds of superhuman abilities in fights, and they are engaged in various 'missions' in fantasy or science fiction themed environments, ranging from the trenches of World War I manned by zombie creatures with advanced weapons, to a traditional castle that needs to be stormed that also serves as the home of a fire breathing dragon and, finally, futuristic environments set on other worlds. During these sequences, they take their orders from an overseer (Scott Glenn) who provides them clues that relate to their missions in the nightclub world.Without a doubt, Zack Snyder and his team have managed to assemble a visually arresting film with densely detailed environments that are very well realized. All the films action sequences are set in synthetic worlds that are full of slick, fantastical elements that are indeed gorgeous to look at. The production design team and visual effects artists have gone the extra mile to make Sucker Punch a very good looking production. What is missing, however, is anything above the thinnest of screenplays that is provided as the skeleton to hang the visuals on. Sucker Punch is flat and lifeless, practically boring after a time, because beyond the pretty pictures, there is very little to the story. One of the film's biggest failings is to enshroud the story in two levels of fantasy, especially the second level that kicks in every time Baby Doll is supposed to be performing her dance routines and we are treated to the action sequences. Because these are complete fantasy, detached from the surrounding narrative, and feature the female characters as indestructible super heroes, with reflexes and skills to rival Superman, we have no emotional investment in these sequences. We don't feel any concern or suspense as to the outcome, because there are no real stakes to them; they are good looking showpieces and that is it, with no real connection to the film at large. When all your characters are indestructible, and you know that everything on the screen is just a fantasy of one of the characters, how can you expect the audience to be invested in what is happening on the screen?It doesn't help that, in the film's larger story, it suffers from practically no real character development to any of the leads. There are a significant number of attractive, young female actresses in the various main roles, but the people they are supposed to be embodying are almost completely without any investment by the screenplay other than to have them simply move through the motions of the story events. We learn practically nothing about any of them, save for some minor surface detail, so we are not interested or involved in what happens to any of them as the film progresses, for the most part. As it reaches its climax, there is a twinge of empathy for one of the characters, but the emotional payoff is still nowhere what it could be if there was any more depth to these characters than what was necessary to just move the plot forward.Since there is very little to the characters, the actors do the best they can, but it is mostly for naught. Oscar Issacs, as the captor, Blue, manages to deliver up some over-the-top scenery chewing as the villain, but Cornish and her cohorts could be realized by just about any actress as presented in Sucker Punch, that is how little the film is dependent on most of its characters. The stars of this film are the visuals, not actors.Sucker Punch does not bode well for Zack Snyder's ability to craft a film from scratch with any degree of story or character beyond the bare minimum needed for him to craft the intricate images that he has obviously decided to focus on in this film. Sucker Punch is impressive to look at, but there is almost absolutely nothing more to it beneath the glossy sheen of its fancy exterior.",5,1,4,3 June 2011
Skyfall," A solid Bond entry
","50 years after the release of the first James Bond film, Dr. No, the world's best known spy returns for his 23rd official screen outing, and the third with Daniel Craig in the role, with Skyfall. The good news is that Skyfall is a strong entry in the Bond canon, exploring character and story material never before considered in a Bond film. The less good news is that Skyfall still manages to fall a little short of greatness, partially due to an inflated running time and saggy midsection.Skyfall opens, in standard Bond tradition, with a rousing pre-title sequence in which Bond and partner Eve (Naomie Harris) attempt to stop a list containing the identities of the British Secret Service's deep cover agents in terrorist agents from falling into the wrong hands. At the end of an energetic chase through Istanbul, Bond is accidentally shot by Eve and believed dead. He isn't, of course (now, THAT would be a real departure for a Bond film), but decides to engage in an unplanned vacation. However, when MI6 headquarters is bombed, and head M (Judi Dench) receives some ominous electronic threats, Bond returns from self- imposed exile to try to find the parties responsible. However, age and his recent injuries make his fitness for the job questionable, with Garreth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), questioning whether it is time for Bond to retire for real.With M's backing, Bond heads to Shanghai to locate the hired killer who stole the list, and the trail leads to Silva (Javier Bardem), a former MI6 agent who was turned over to the Chinese authorities by M in the past due to him operating outside of protocol, and Silva hasn't taken that lightly, leading him to engage in a personal vendetta against M. Bond must try to outwit Silva, who proves a formidable adversary on a variety of fronts, and keep him from fulfilling his mission of revenge against M.Skyfall is not your typical Bond film in a number of ways. Instead of the usual globe-trotting antics of many Bond entries, much of Skyfall unfolds in London and the countryside of the UK and the immediate neighbors. Sure there are some detours to China and Turkey, but this is the most a Bond film has been set in it's home base than I can ever remember. Skyfall also elects to engage in much more character development of Bond than most of the series. Bond finds himself put through an emotional and physical wringer, dealing with both the onset of age and the wounds generated in the line of duty. Skyfall is the first Bond outing that seems to truly exist in a post-9/11 world, with the nature of espionage and whether the decisions the leaders of those organizations have made are correct in the world as it currently is. Skyfall isn't content to just rehash the standard Bond formula, but engage in a degree of self-deconstruction of that formula as to whether it is still viable.Back in the lead for his third time, Craig brings a degree of world- weariness to the role of Bond. With a multi-day growth of greying stubble for the first half of the film, and sporting a shoulder wound from a tussle with a enemy operative, Craig truly makes it appear at the outset that Bond is ready to be put out to pasture. Once again, despite a few brief encounters with some secondary characters, Craig's Bond is also less interested in bedding the ladies than he is in taking on the bad guys in his current incarnation. In Craig's hands, Bond is largely a man of vertical, not horizontal, action.As Silva, Javier Bardem gives Skyfall the most memorable and formidable villain the series has seen in some outings. Sporting a blond wig, a number of effeminate traits (in one scene he is practically seducing Bond) and skill at verbal jousting to rival Hannibal Lecter, Bardem largely commands the screen when he is around. Silva also is a villain who isn't without a degree of method to his madness, as he challenges the modern, corrupt world we live in, introducing the idea that perhaps it is time for individuals to take matters into their own hands.Judi Dench is handed the largest role the character of M has ever received, and she makes M less of a plot device and more of a central person in Bond's world. Over Craig's entries in the series, M has been given more of a presence than in the earlier films, and her part in Skyfall represents the character at it's pinnacle. M, much like Bond, is studied with a critical eye here, forced to deal with questions of her organizations relevance in the modern world.Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes, helming his first full on action film, proves strong at staging the usual set pieces of the Bond universe, and he and cinematographer Roger Deakins craft a visually arresting look for Skyfall. At times almost monochromatic in color, Skyfall oozes craftsmanship in many of its moments. The title song, performed by Adele, is also one that hearkens back to the days of Shirley Bassey during the Connery era.Skyfall does have weaknesses, largely due to an excessive running time. Bond films have never been brief affairs, but Skyfall seems a bit padded at times, especially in it's middle to late 3rd, where the narrative slows a bit too much. And also, despite plumbing some new depths of character, Skyfall still manages to fall a little short of true emotional resonance at times, displaying all the right trappings, but still feeling a little empty.That being said, Skyfall is certainly a solid entry for James Bond, and one can only hope that whomever takes the creative reins next will build upon the strong foundations of Skyfall and make the next film truly soar.",7,4,12,10 November 2012
Spartacus," Spartacus a grand entertainment
","Spartacus is a film from an era when Hollywood was pushing spectacle in your face. The growing popularity of television had whittled the movie going audience to a fraction of what it had been just a decade before, with millions of Americans deciding to stay home and get their visual entertainment for free rather than trek to theaters. As a response, studios began creating epic entertainments, historical epics or biblical stories, filmed in one of many wide screen processes to ensure that what was delivered was more than you could get in your living room. Spartacus is a historical epic of this nature, the story of a slave revolt in the Roman empire led by a man named Spartacus. While many of the trappings of the film are familiar to almost anyone who has seen this type of film, it is unique and thought provoking in many ways, although not quite a masterpiece.Based on a novel by Howard Fast, Spartacus finds our hero a slave since birth working in a Roman camp mining precious metals. He is sold to a gladiatorial training school run by Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) where he taught the arts of becoming a gladiator. He also is introduced to women for the first time in his life, specifically slave Verinia (Jean Simmons), but instead of taking her forcefully, Spartacus chooses to treat her like an equal, and this impresses her. After training for some time, Spartacus is one of four gladiators that is selected for a combat to the death to entertain visitors of Batiatus, including powerful Roman Patrician Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier). The outcome of the match, and the selling of Verinia to Crassus, enrages Spartacus and the other gladiators who revolt and capture the school. They eventually organize around Spartacus, who convinces them that if they can escape the clutches of the Romans by freeing slaves, forming an army and begin marching to the sea, where they can escape by ship to return to their homelands.With this revolt underway, the Roman Senate attempts to break the slaves by sending various Roman forces against them, but each falls under the might of the freed slaves. At the heart of the Roman opposition are Senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton), who represents the masses, and Crassus, who serves the elite mindset. They each perform maneuvers behind the scenes to either support or hinder Spartacus' campaign, with the final result being the furthering of their own political goals.At the heart of Spartacus is a story of, essentially, class warfare. The Romans are the upper echelon, keeping the mass of slaves under their boot. They treat them without care, using them for both entertainment purposes as gladiators and concubines. The Roman elite are viewed as corrupt and unfeeling towards the human lives they have put into bondage. The slaves are seen as much more noble individuals, fighting for their freedom from the Roman oppression. Unfortunately, the film is much more engaging in it's Roman scenes than in it's slave scenes. The Roman characters are more interesting, their dialogue better written and the various layers of their complicated machinations more enthralling than those of the slaves. We are supposed to root for Spartacus, but his character is left underdeveloped, and his romance with Verinia is not very involving or touching. It is not without some charm, but on the whole proves rather rote. The Romans aren't characters we root for, but when their scenes are on camera, they are at least interesting to watch.Spartacus is well known for it's elaborate spectacle. It's battle scenes, while not as gritty or realistic as ones from more modern epics, are still impressive and grand. The major battles were filmed in Spain with use of the Spanish army, and the mass of individuals used are sight to see. But again, as the slave characters are underdeveloped, it is hard to find yourself really caught up in the action.Aside from it's epic scale, Spartacus is also notable for it's impressive cast. The combined power of British thespians Olivier, Laughton, and Ustinov is a rarity in cinema, and they all perform their parts admirably and provide the most memorable parts of the film. Spartacus was also the first major studio film from director Stanley Kubrick, who had made a few smaller films before Spartacus, but this really catapulted him to the big time. Kubrick would later distance himself from the production, as he did not nurture it from inception but was merely a hired hand (brought in to replace director Anthony Mann), but it is easy to see what would have made the film attractive to him. Kubrick has often made films with a theme of classism at it's heart, and that is the central theme of Spartacus. It is the most accessible film Kubrick has ever made.Spartacus is a decent epic film, with a bit more depth than what you find in most epics, thank's mostly to the scenes involving the machinations of the Romans. If you are interested in the grand scale films of that era, Spartacus is worth viewing.",8,2,4,27 June 2006
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Looks good, does nothing
","At this point in the franchise, I have to ask, who is still watching the Resident Evil movies that actually enjoys them? Does anyone glean any excitement, interest or just plain, simple entertainment value from these films? Because, based on what is on display in Resident Evil: Afterlife, unless you are interested in watching a stream of unexciting action sequences with little or no grounding in reality, you will mostly likely walk away from the film with nothing but a feeling of derision.Resident Evil: Afterlife picks up where the last entry, Resident Evil: Extinction, ended, with Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her endless stream of clones assaulting the Japanese headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation, who have caused the majority of the world's population to be transformed into flesh eating zombies (I hate it when that happens). After bringing down the head of this particular unit, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts, one of the worst actors I have seen in some time), Alice travels to Alaska to meet up with a group of survivors led by Claire (Ali Larter). However, she finds only Claire still there, and Claire's memories are gone and she has a device resembling a beetle attached to her chest that is causing both her memory loss and some rather anti-social behavior. Alice and Claire decide to fly down the coast in search of other survivors, finding a group holed up in a prison outside L.A., comprised, among others, of Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Hollywood producer Bennet (Kim Coates), and Claire's brother, Chris (Wentworth Miller). The group must try to escape the legions of the undead surrounding the prison and reach a large tanker ship off the coast that represents their only hope for survival.Resident Evil: Afterlife is a film that exists for one purpose and one purpose only: to string together fight after fight, shootout after shootout, all of them choreographed and photographed with various slick camera techniques that should, I suppose, raise your pulse. That is all the film even attempts to accomplish, because it doesn't really try to do anything else. The story, what there is of one, is both barely an afterthought and mostly cribbed from other zombie movies, such as Night of the Living Dead. Afterlife isn't even trying to be a horror film anymore, which its predecessors weren't really accomplished at, but gave a passing thought to the concept. This is an action movie, through and through, but since the characters are basically non-entities, there is nobody to root for, so all you are doing is watching bodies and objects in motion, with nothing to give any additional depth to any of the proceedings.The acting is mostly a non-issue, because the people on screen are there simply to shoot guns or get knocked off in various zombie attacks. When any of the characters get killed, there isn't even a moment's thought as to their well-being; they are cardboard cutouts, not people. The film introduces Chris as Claire's brother, but that plot development is as pointless as any other in the film, because other than the briefest exchange of dialogue to establish this fact, it serves absolutely no purpose to the story or to the characters. The film does itself an even greater disservice by casting Roberts in the role of the villain, because you would swear they just plucked a random body off the street, not actually went through the process of hiring someone who claims to be an actor, as Robert's performance is akin to someone reading text off a teleprompter. How can the audience root against someone who is so lifeless, without even an iota of energy?Are the action sequences cool looking? Sure, but nothing so impressive to make your forget films such as The Matrix where some of the techniques and images were obviously lifted from. And without any feeling to proceedings, there is nothing for you to invest in. There is no suspense, no excitement, no horror, no nothing to Afterlife. It just is, sitting there looking pretty, and isn't even afforded the decency of a real ending, just some scenes serving as a potential setup for yet another Resident Evil movie. And, as I started off this review, is there any audience that really wants another one? Is there someone waiting, clamoring for yet another Resident Evil film? I find it hard to believe.",3,1,4,2 June 2011
United 93," An example of excellence
","One thing is for certain: United 93 is a difficult movie to watch. It is unflinching in it's almost moment by moment dissection of September 11, 2001, at least from the point of view of the air traffic controllers, the military controllers and, of course, the passengers and crew of United flight 93. It pulls no punches, doesn't soft pedal anything and really only restrains itself at the last moments, where taste would allow nothing else. And in doing so, writer-director Paul Greengrass has crafted what is almost certain to be the best movie in 2006. That is a high bar to set, but it is difficult to imagine any film coming any closer to the excellence on display here.United 93 is, almost needless to say, a gut-wrenchingly detailed and, seemingly, accurate, re-creation of many of the events of the morning of 9/11. It's principal focus, more or less, is on the titular flight that was the only one of four planes hijacked that morning to fail to reach it's intended target, in this case, the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. We see the passengers and crew going through their average routines, preparing the flight for takeoff, talking about their lives in snippets, nothing out of the ordinary. The flight control centers that are key to the days events are also introduced, tracking planes, worrying about the weather, the usual stuff for them. We also see the terrorists preparing themselves, praying and gathering their weapons. They appear, to the average individual, no different than anyone else. Few would realize that these four individuals are capable of the acts they are about to perform.To give a traditional plot summary, beyond the above setup, is practically useless. This is not really a traditional narrative film. Greengrass has put it together in an almost documentary form, using almost no recognizable actors (and often utilizing the real individuals that were working in the air traffic control centers), hand-held camera moves and very few filmic tricks. We believe we are in the rooms with these individuals when it happens, following along as the day's horrific developments unfold. It is almost shocking to view the early moments when the first flight is believed to be hijacked and the air traffic controllers almost dismiss it. It has been so long since something like that has happened, they can't believe in the possibility. It is only after listening to cockpit transmissions from the first plane to be reported hijacked, American 11, that the reality of the situation sinks in.We are quickly drawn in to the confusion, the sense of pure helplessness in the film. These men and women at the various locations are simply unable to really do anything, and as audience members, we can sit and scream mentally on the inside to do something. But that day was simply one that was unprecedented and beyond comprehension. The actors in United 93 are stellar in their performances. The nuances, delivery and body language are more believable than almost any other fiction film I have ever witnessed. The direction is near perfect also. The editing and choice of camera angles bring us into the action, never locking us out.Throughout, Greengrass mounts the tension impressively. We know the outcome, how things will turn out, but we can't help but be caught up in the moment. After the terrorists capture Flight 93 and the passengers begin plotting to take back the plane, the moments as they call their loved ones and give their goodbyes are heart-wrenching, to say the least. Composer John Powell deserves a strong notice for crafting an understated, yet amazingly effective score that does not manipulate your emotions, but underlines what is happening on screen, especially in the film's concluding moments.For those who might complain about the portrayal of the terrorists, I find this a difficult point for anyone to argue over. Greengrass gives them as much objectivity as the other characters, and we cannot help but be affected, emotionally, by their actions. We see at least one, the lead terrorist, portrayed by Khalid Abdalla, who is obviously having reservations about his actions and decision to go forward with this plan. His fellow hijackers are more than willing to make the move, but he is not. The final actions are known, but Greengrass does not reduce these men to caricatures, they are believable men who do inexplicable things.It is almost impossible to watch United 93 and not be flooded by a range of emotions, ranging from sadness, helplessness, and, most significantly, anger. You almost find yourself wanting to jump onto the screen and take matters into your own hands, to stop the inevitable from unfolding, but you must just watch as the film moves toward it's inescapable conclusion.There are few other films that are this effective at moving an audience without manipulating them, and for that reason alone, United 93 is an impressive feat. But it is more than that. It is a template for how filmed accounts of events such as this should be mounted, a defining moment in film history. United 93 is the very best movie I have seen in a long time, and will not be quickly forgotten.",10,2,5,29 May 2006
Underworld," Emotional dead zone
","One part The Matrix, one part Blade, Underworld is yet another modern take on vampires that bypasses the traditions of the genre (black cloaks, castles, striking male vampires with Eastern European accents) by embracing what are quickly becoming a new set of traditions of the genre (black leather, spandex, low lighting, lots and lots of automatic weapons) and failing to make any of it the least bit compelling.  Underworld is just dead space, a well-polished engine that goes nowhere fast.The initial premise sounds very promising:  Vampires and werewolves have been engaging in a secret war for thousands of years, with the aristocratic vampires holding the upper hand.  That upper hand are 'Death Dealers,' elite werewolf-killing assassins, who approach their job without remorse.  Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one the best Death Dealers, living for the thrill of the kill.  Now, however, her world is threatened by a new element:  a human named Michael (Scott Speedman) who the werewolves, referred to in the film as Lycans, have their eye towards, for unknown reasons.  Eager to find the answers, she defies the leader of her coven, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and begins conducting an investigation, finding herself falling in love with Michael.Despite the possibilities the setting provides, Underworld does very little with it.  The film is basically one long set of shoot outs and fight scenes, all well-choreographed and photographed, but there is no real substance to anything.  It doesn't help that the main characters, Selene and Michael, are completely empty of any development.  They have seemingly less dialogue than the supporting characters, and neither is well-developed by the screenplay at all.  We get a hint of background for Selene, but it is too little too late, and Michael is a cypher, lacking any significant backstory to his character, and barely a handful of scenes, it seems.  The romance of these characters is supposed to draw us in, but I couldn't have cared less. The romance is without an semblance of interest or emotion, leaving the film without an emotional core to hang our interest on.The supporting cast, especially Michael Sheen as a lead werewolf, are far more interesting than the leads, but the script proves rather thin.  The plot seems rather half-explained, not to mention underdeveloped.  When the big 'surprises' of the film are revealed, it elicits a 'So? That's it?' response.  The film is also hampered by Shane Brolly as Kraven, the only character who could classify as a villain.  His performance plays as if he is reading his lines off a teleprompter, and his melodramatics remind you of a high school play.Director Len Wiseman is a former art director for several major films, including Stargate, and a director of music videos.  His film does indeed look gorgeous, but that is all there is to it.  The meat is missing, it's just the fancy packaging that is left.",5,0,0,11 October 2003
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," You won't want to be Forgetting this comedy
","Prior to the release of The 40 Year Old Virgin, it is likely that few people knew the name Judd Apatow. Now, just three years later, that name has become almost a stamp of comedy quality, with such films as Knocked Up and Superbad following on the heels of The 40 Year Old Virgin. Now, the Apatow steamroller moves forward with Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and once again it has mined comedy gold, with lots of laughs, but also, as with many of the previous film's from Apatow's company, a nice streak of sweet romance to go along with the laughs.Fogetting Sarah Marshall focuses on Peter Bretter (Jason Segel), a Hollywood composer who's girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), is the star of a CSI-style police procedural series. Jason is a bit of a layabout (who also isn't afraid to walk around his apartment naked), and Sarah has decided she has had enough of him, so she is breaks up with Peter, leaving him in a seemingly unending pool of despair.To try to take his mind of Sarah, he takes an impromptu vacation to Hawaii, but quickly discovers, to his horror, that Sarah is also at the same hotel as him, with her new boyfriend, recently on the wagon British rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). However, while doing his best to avoid Sarah, Peter finds himself falling for a hotel staff member, Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis).As with such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a comedy that isn't afraid to mine the more vulgar for comedy, nor does it shy away from some rather frank nudity, including plenty of footage of star Segel (who is also the screenwriter). The upside is that, unlike many other sophomoric comedies these days, the raunchier material actually produces laughs. Much of the film's best humor comes from Brand's performance as off the wall Snow. The character has lots of great scenes and lines, capitalizing on the characters seeming insatiable libido.Forgetting Sarah Marshall doesn't just provide lots of laughs, it also features an involving and touching romance between Peter and Rachel. Both Segel and Kunis have a nice chemistry between them that fuels an involving romance. As the film progresses, we can't help but root for the characters to find themselves together in the end.In addition to the previously mentioned Brand, the cast of Forgetting Sarah Marshall gives us both great laughs and characters we can be involved with. Segel proves to be relatively low on insecurity as he puts himself almost completely on display (literally). His Peter is an character whose rather unassuming nature wins you over. Kristen Bell makes the films titular character at times apparently self-involved, but also someone who has a soft spot for her ex-boyfriend. Kunis' Rachel is a character that is both no-nonsense and full of sweetness.In the end, Forgetting Sarah Marshall proves to be another winner from 'Team Apatow', and belongs right next to the previous hits from his creative team. If you are looking for both laughs and a dash of romance, look no further than Forgetting Sarah Marshall.",8,40,67,4 December 2008
The Hunger Games," Decent but unspectacular YA adaptation
","With the Harry Potter films over and Twilight concluding soon, Hollywood has filled the financially lucrative void with its latest Young Adult series adaptation, The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a stronger than the first Harry Potter film, but is still only a decent but unspectacular film, with a lot of ideas at the core, but not quite mining them all to success.The film opens at some point in the future, where society has collapsed and the country is split into 12 impoverished districts while the control is located in the resplendent Capitol. In the past, the Districts had rose up against the Capitol, but had been put down, and as punishment The Hunger Games was born: a televised competition where one boy and one girl from each district are chosen annually to fight one another in a bloody tournament where only one survivor can go home. From District 12, Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is selected, but her older and tougher sister, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her place. Also selected from District 12 is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who holds a secret crush for Katniss.At the Capitol, they participate in a series of training exercises and public ceremonies leading up to the games, groomed by Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) to create a memorable impression on the crowds whom they will rely on as potential sponsors for weapons and supplies during the games. They are also given survival guidance by Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), the last winner from District 12 who is now a lush, using his position largely as an opportunity to avail himself of food and drink. Katniss quickly proves an impressive find, and gamemaster Seneca (Wes Bentley) tries to influence President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to make a few adjustments to the games due to her, but Snow is not so taken, seeing her strength and willpower as dangerous. When the games are finally underway, in a wooded landscape, Katniss must summon all her strength and resourcefulness to survive the elements and her fellow players.You would have to have been living under a rock for the last decade or so to not recognize the Hunger Games is a cautionary tale about modern reality TV taken to the Nth degree. It is most successful when the characters are being featured on a talk show, hosted by an over-the-top Stanley Tucci, which resembles today's fluff interview programs such as The Tonight Show and Entertainment Weekly, biting satire which hits the mark. Tucci and his co-anchor, portrayed by Toby Jones, commentate and reflect on the games as if people's lives weren't in the balance, giving us a glimpse at what could, unfortunately, be our future. Unfortunately, the background of the dystopian world the characters live in is underdeveloped, leaving a lot of questions concerning how the Capitol maintains control of the people unexplored.The Hunger Games doesn't really tread any ground that hasn't already been well-worn by other works, including The Running Man, Battle Royale and more. The idea of man's inhumanity to man being treated as entertainment is certainly not groundbreaking, but in the world of YA literature, it seems, everything old is new again. However, the decision to go for a PG-13 rating dulls the film's potential edge. While it doesn't completely shy away from the violence inherent in the story, shaky camera motion and quick edits keep the audience at arm's length from the true viciousness of the concept that is really worth exploring. The film also suffers from a bit too much from archetypal characters. Katniss and Peeta are both somewhat naive, innocent and inherently 'good' individuals. Aside from a young girl named Roo (Amandla Stenberg) who is befriended by Katniss, almost all the rest of the participants in the games are bloodthirsty jackals, reveling in the murder of the others. Most of them are merely fodder for the story's eventual parade of death, but the few that stand out are 'evil'. We can't help but root for our heroes, they are among the only relatable people in the story. As with other stories targeted at a teen female audience, there is the seemingly inevitable love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and another boy from District 12, Gale (Liam Hemsworth). For the most part, though, this is just window dressing to the film, a storyline that may have more meat in the source novel, but here lacks depth. Gale and Katniss relationship doesn't have any chemistry to it, and Hemsworth's scenes are minimal. Katniss and Peeta's relationship isn't any deeper, and several of the scenes where they begin to connect romantically are manipulative and ineffective. The two don't come across as being attracted to each other, but merely going through the motions the screenplay has laid out for them.Jennifer Lawrence, who came to notice from her work in Winter's Bone, impresses as Katniss. She provides us with a girl who is alternately strong, scared and thoughtful. She is the film's anchor, and when the Hunger Games works in its second half, it is often due to her performance. Surprisingly, the most engaging relationship in the film is between Katniss and Cinna, with their parting scene one of the emotional high points. Josh Hutcherson does give Peeta a nice dose of naivete, but he proves a tad underwhelming in the role. Stanley Tucci chews the scenery with great aplomb in his moments, Wes Bentley comes across as a man who is a bit too easily manipulated for his own good, and Donald Sutherland gives President Snow and quiet degree of menace.I give credit to The Hunger Games for addressing ideas and issues relevant to the current state of society, but the package that it is delivered in ultimately proves a bit underwhelming. With the ground- work laid, perhaps the next installment will be a stronger film and build on the base of The Hunger Games.",6,1,3,11 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," This film is just 'Dead' time
","Once upon a time, there was a summer sequel that invaded multiplexes with fire and power, crushing multiple records, leaving box office charts in shreds. That film was Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. There is one interesting side note about it's success: it isn't very good. If you would like to see a bloated, overlong, and generally unentertaining expenditure of $200 million plus dollars on screen, then pony up for Dead Man's Chest. If you want to see a entertaining movie, then keep looking.Dead Man's Chest opens some time after the conclusion of the first entry, with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) on the day of their wedding. The nuptials are interrupted by Cutter Beckett (Tom Hollander), representing the East India Trading Company, who is interested in Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and is using Will and Elizabeth to reach his goals. He strikes a deal with Will: Bring him Jack and he and Elizabeth will be let go. Jack also has problems of his own: he is being chased by the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, along with some very impressive CGI), who has survived death by becoming a combo of sea beings, to pay up a dept he owes Jones: his soul. Jack is, needless to say, interested in avoiding this, so he goes in search of a relic that will give him the drop on Jones, and Will comes along for the ride, with the plan to return to save Elizabeth.So, let's start with the good stuff: Dead Man's Chest is gorgeous to look at, beautifully photographed by Dariusz Wolski, with equally impressive production design by Rick Heinrichs. Also, the visual effects that realize Davy Jones and the crew of the Flying Dutchman, his ship, is beyond superb. The crew are realized as amalgams of creatures of the deep, and their integration with the live action photography is excellent, worthy of an Academy Award nomination at the very least. And Johnny Depp is once again fairly entertaining as Jack Sparrow, although not quite as much as the first installment.All that leaves plenty of room for the bad stuff. If Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was overlong, then Dead Man's Chest is nearly unending. The film clocks in a two and half hours, and that is a minimum of an hour too long. The film moves at an absolute crawl, with enough extraneous material to fill two other movies. It takes forever to actually get going and the first hour is almost completely unnecessary setup, with lots of side trips off the main plot: Jack and crew ending up on an island where he is worshipped as a god and the crew are all food for the cannibalistic natives; Elizabeth trying to catch up to Will and Jack by hitching a ride on another ship and befuddling the crew; the Black Pearl recruiting a crew to help them out and meeting up with an old adversary, etc., etc. Most of this stuff just slows down the narrative and pads the film's running length without adding anything. It's more than an hour into the film before the real villains show up and the story finally gets going.What doesn't help is that the screenplay is almost completely unable to really explain anything that is going on. Beckett wants Jack for an object he possesses, and Davy Jones wants to keep . . . something safe. The film actually explains what these characters are after, but the explanations do nothing, because I still don't know what anyone is really after in this film. Everything in Dead Man's Chest is half-explained, and I guess the fact that this is part of a two film cycle (with another sequel to follow) is supposed to give some reason as to why full information is not given out, but it just leaves audiences head's scratching. When you sit through a two and a half hour movie and still don't really understand any of the character's motivations for doing anything, it can prove to be a letdown.Dead Man's Chest also suffers from relatively non-existent character development. Will and Elizabeth seem to have used up any depth to their characters in the first film, because they are both relative ciphers here. Their love affair has little or no passion, you don't really feel any draw to either of them, and their plight is rather uninvolving. Jack Sparrow is fun to watch at times, but his rather unbending 'me for myself' attitude makes it difficult to latch onto him as a hero. Bill Nighy turns in a decent performance as Davy Jones, and while the effects used to realize him are impressive to say the least, he proves to not be a tremendously imposing villain.In the never ending sweepstakes to separate the viewer from their cash, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has cooked up a impressive looking spectacle that is hollow to the core and takes forever to get where it is trying to go, and once you arrive, you find that there is nothing special waiting for you.",5,4,7,26 October 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Go sailing with these Pirates
","At first announcement, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl sounded like a really bad idea to me. It was one of three films announced that would be adaptations (for lack of a better word) of rides or shows at Disneyland. The first was The Country Bears, which I skipped and the third was The Haunted Mansion, which was none too impressive. Pirates of the Caribbean had probably the best cast, headlined by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, and was produced by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I was still skeptical, but Pirates of the Caribbean proved to be better than it's pedigree would suggest. It is an entertaining, enjoyable romp, albeit a little overlong.Pirates of the Caribbean focuses on young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith's apprentice who has a thing for, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) the daughter of the Governor of the British Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), a notorious pirate, arrives at Port Royal in search of the Black Pearl, a pirate ship he had previously been Captain of but had been deposed by a uprising led by the ship's first mate, Barbossa (Rush). Sparrow is captured by the local militia when the Pearl attacks the colony and makes off with Elizabeth. Sparrow strikes a deal with Will to help him track down the Pearl and save Elizabeth, but the crew of the Black Pearl are not exactly what they seem: they have stolen and spent Aztec gold, which came complete with a curse that has turned them into the walking dead, a fate they are attempting to reverse and Elizabeth has the last piece of gold they need.Considering there is a dearth of good, old fashioned swashbuckling films in Hollywood today, Pirates of the Caribbean actually manages to be somewhat unique in the current entertainment climate. It, for the most part, lives up to the visual style you would expect from a pirate film, complete with elaborate sailing ships, down and dirty crew members, plenty of swordfights and cannon battles, not to mention the obligatory walking of the plank. However, director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot don't just deliver a standard pirate film, but one with a nice streak of comedy to it. Most of the humor is derived from the lead of Jack Sparrow. As portrayed by Depp, the master of cinematic eccentricity, Sparrow is a rather unusual pirate. Yes, he is self-serving and double-crossing, but he is also played with such a humorous air and a light touch by Depp as to become endearing. He also ensures that we aren't just looking at an actor using the role of a pirate to provide the usual moustache twirling. Jack isn't a hero, but he's not a villain either.Pirates of the Caribbean is an attractive enough film, no expense was spared in creating an environment that fits the material and when the action sequences kick in, they are engaging enough. However, this kind of film is still somewhat fluffy entertainment, not exactly the deepest of material, and Pirates of the Caribbean manages to overstay it's welcome a bit. The film runs 143 minutes, and eventually, it starts to feel like it. It never grinds to a complete halt, but it has no less than three points where it would seem to be reaching a conclusion and yet manages to keep going. This is the kind of film that needs to clock in well under two hours, not run two and half.The rest of the cast acquits themselves well. Rush turns in a decent performance as the villainous Barbossa, Bloom is appropriately fresh-faced and yet defiant enough as Will and Keira Knightley manages to blend her good looks with fire as Elizabeth. The film also boasts some nice visual effects when the Black Pearl crew is exposed to moonlight, when they are revealed as walking skeletons.All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean is a good, fun movie that is more than worth checking out, just don't be surprised if you start checking your watch a little late into the film.",7,1,3,27 June 2006
Blade," An entertaining Blade
","In the mid-1990s, Marvel Comics film adaptations where in the midst of some serious doldrums. The previous released Marvel adaptation had been a film version of Captain America that was produced for a extremely low budget and ended up going straight to video, which was appropriate considering how terrible it was. There had also been an abortive attempt to produce a Fantastic Four film, but after the completion of the film, it was shelved when producer Bern Eichenger made a deal with director/producer Chris Columbus to produce a big-budget version (which would take more than a decade to actually make it to screen). It was into this environment of calamity that emerged a film centered around a little-known Marvel character named Blade. Blade, a half-human, half-vampire who has devoted his life to destroying other vampires, didn't seem like a likely choice to bring some light to the Marvel universe, but it did and managed, in many ways to breathe life back into Marvel film adaptations.Written by comics aficionado David Goyer (whose personal collection of comics reportedly stretched into the thousands), Blade was a vehicle for Wesley Snipes, directed by a former make-up effects artist turned director named Stephen Norrington. The results, while not perfect, are rather entertaining for a action-driven comic adaptation. Blade starts off with guns blazing, featuring a high-energy action sequence in an impromptu vampire nightclub where vampires gather to feast on unlucky victims. The sequence is full of energy, some rather tense suspense at the appropriate moments and well-staged fight sequences.It is from here that the film's plot begins to unfold: the world is secretly ruled by an ancient race of vampires who control much of the financial empire throughout the globe, manipulating humans and using some as their pawns. Blade, assisted by his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), a man whose family was killed by a vampire, hunts down vampires from city to city, desperately attempting to rid the world of this scourge. It is after a vampire bites a doctor involved in blood research, Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), whom Blade attempts to save from becoming a vampire, that he finds himself drawn closer to his arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), who is attempting to translate ancient vampire text to discover the secrets of a all-powerful deity who will transform the world into vampires.Blade is not high-art, that is for sure. The film is not designed to change your life or make you think deeply about important issues. It is, however, designed to provide some entertainment for it's running time, and pulls it off fairly well. As with other films of it's type, when a complicated culture has to be introduced to the audience, an outsider is the perfect opportunity, and Karen Jenson provides that entrance into the world of the vampires, allowing for exposition that is not unrealistically placed. We learn a fair amount about the film's vampire world, and it proves interesting at times. However, this is first and foremost an action film, and Blade services that aspect well. Beyond the opening scene, there are several major fight sequences in Blade, all well choreographed and destined to get the adrenaline pumping. Director Norrington uses some stylization during the course of the film, including time-lapse photography, but doesn't overdo it like other films heavy on action in recent years.Wesley Snipes is strong in the role of Blade, making an indelible impression, even with limited dialogue. He looks the part of hardened vampire killer and wears the role well. Kris Kristofferson is good as his mentor Whistler, providing some necessary levity at moments and giving us a more human hero to latch onto when Blade proves a bit less than talkative. N'Bushe Wright is serviceable in her role, but proves to be a somewhat bland companion for Blade. Stephen Dorff gives a good performance as the villain, without going over the top.Blade is not quite as good as other Marvel adaptations that followed it in short order, such as X-Men and Spider-Man, but it is a decent piece of action film-making that does it's job well.",7,2,5,27 March 2006
Alexander," Pointless epic
","Alexander is the most plodding, uneventful historical epic I have ever layed eyes on. Directed by Oliver Stone, he transforms the life of a major historical figure, Alexander the Great, into a muddled mess of a film, teaching us nothing of the man, not to mention his great quests.It had been public knowledge that Alexander the Great had been a pet project of Stone's for a long time, but after viewing the results it's hard to believe that Stone gave much thought to who this person really was. The film meanders from scene to scene, focusing first on Alexander's tempestuous relationships with both his mother and father, moving on to his victory against a superior Persian force at Gaugemela, his travels Eastward, eventually to India, finally his return to the city of Babylon and his undoing. Yet, as much as the above description seems to suggest that Stone covers Alexander's life, in the end I don't really feel as if I know much of anything about Alexander or those around him.Alexander's narrative is revealed via a voice-over by Alexander's associate Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) many years after Alexander's death, recounting the tales of Alexander's exploits. He tells of Alexander's early life with his mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie), and his father, King Phillip (Val Kilmer), who are at each other's throats, although the film is never clear why. Alexander grows to manhood, in the guise of Colin Ferrell, and continues to have a contentious relationship with his father, and seems to start one with his mother, until his father dies, and Alexander sets out on a quest to bring those that he believes are responsible to justice. This leads to the battle with the Persians, and Alexander then moves on to conquer what is the known world, while at the same time, bringing civilization to the world.It is said that when a long movie is good, you never notice. Well, Alexander isn't one of those movies. Alexander seems to go on forever, scene after scene, with little or nothing interesting to offer the audience. Alexander appears to want to tell us the life story of the man, but frankly, he stays undeveloped. Yes, the film pays lip service to Alexander's desire to educate the world and bring civilization to those viewed as barbarians, but these are just words. Alexander features scene after scene where characters argue with each other, which seems like drama, except that these characters aren't really saying anything. The dialogue is just words pouring out because they need to. The characters say nothing of value.There is a lot of attention paid to Alexander's bisexuality, specifically his attraction to Hephastion (Jared Leto), his longtime companion, but there is no interest to be generated from this relationship, or any other. There is no sense of chemistry or love, and later when Alexander takes a wife in the form of Roxane (Rosario Dawson) she serves as just window- dressing; again, there is no development of the relationship.In any historical epic, you usually expect some epic battle sequences, any while there are some attempted in Alexander, they are woefully inept. With no real interest in the characters, the battle scenes just go through the motions, providing no excitement or energy to the film at all. The second half of the film mostly focuses on Alexander's trip east, but the supporting characters are all undeveloped, ciphers with little or no personality, who are all interchangeable. When the men rise up in mutiny, and some Alexander's associates are implicated and killed, but their deaths mean nothing to us. There is some lip service payed to Alexander's relationship to his father and mother, but it all adds up to nothing, really. There is no sense of why Alexander defends either at any time, as they are both rather unappealing characters, and all Alexander seems to do whine and complain about both at different times, making look like a wimp, not a powerful ruler.The film also passes over major developments in his life, skipping major battles and lightly covering a major misstep when Alexander moves his soldiers through the desert in one scene. One gets the impression that Stone wanted to cram so much into one film that he glosses over many events that should prove instrumental to Alexander's life.When all is said and done, Alexander is a major failure, and an enormously disappointing film. There was a great deal of interesting material here, but it is all wasted on a bloated epic that proves to be pointless.",5,0,0,7 August 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Average disaster film
","I'll give this to director Roland Emmerich:  he sure knows how to lay waste to major cities.  The Day after Tomorrow is his third round of cinematic mass destruction, following on the heels of an alien invasion in Independence Day and a giant attacking lizard in Godzilla. Of the three, The Day after Tomorrow is probably the most accomplished, but that doesn't necessarily make it a great film, as it moves through most of the standard disaster film clichés without batting an eye, but yet still proves mildly entertaining.Based on the pseudo-science book The Coming Global Superstorm written by radio commentator Art Bell and novelist Whitley Streiber, The Day after Tomorrow opens on an Antarctic ice shelf, where paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his team are collecting ice core samples when the shelf decides to separate, leaving Hall with an ominous sense of dread.  At a Global Warming conference in New Dehli (where it is snowing), Hall informs those gathered, including the rather unsupportive Vice-President of the United States (Kenneth Welsh), that sometime in the future, the very fabric of our warm climate will collapse and send the planet back into an ice age. Hall is generally ignored by the conference goers, until giant tornadoes begin tearing Los Angeles apart, torrential rains lead to massive flooding in New York City, and in Scotland helicopters, and their occupants, freeze instantly.  Hall determines that his predictions where not only correct, but they occurred well ahead of his believed time-table, and advises the President of the US to evacuate the lower states, while the upper states can only sit out the storm for fear that if they leave their homes, they too will freeze to death.  Meanwhile, Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhall) and several classmates are trapped in the flooding, and then freezing, New York City and Jack sets out to try and save him from what seems certain doom.The Day after Tomorrow follows the rather standard disaster film formula of introducing dire portents of an upcoming tragedy, including a well-meaning scientist who tries to warn others but is viewed as a kook, followed by the beginning of the disaster, along with the sudden realization that what was warned is really happening, and after the bulk of the disaster has passed, then comes the aftermath as people must attempt to save themselves. There isn't a whole lot here to enliven the process beyond the standard, and as such there is little in the film that really takes you by surprise. 
As with most big disaster films, what really pushes the picture along is it's spectacular scenes of disaster, and in this department The Day after Tomorrow excels, featuring some rather impressive imagery of tornadoes, tidal waves and giant storms.  Probably the strongest material is centered on New York when the city is flooded, which doesn't fail to disappoint in the spectacle department.  However, amazing visual effects doesn't really take the place of an interesting plot, and the Day after Tomorrow doesn't have much to offer once the disaster starts dying down.Acting is generally capable, but no one really stands out.  Dennis Quaid is decent as the obsessive scientist who tries to warn people of the danger, and then must make a personal journey into the unknown to try and save his son.  Jake Gyllenhall is also adequate as Sam, and most of the rest of the cast get the job done, but there are no overwhelming performances. The human cast simply serves the plot.If it sounds like I am very on-the-fence about the Day after Tomorrow, you would be correct.  It is a mildly entertaining popcorn film, but nothing I would whole-heartedly recommend.  If you are interested in impressive scenes of cities being toppled by out of control weather, check it out.  If you are looking for a little more character depth and emotion to go with your disaster, rent Titanic.",6,0,0,7 June 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A reasonably fitting 'end'
","Once you start downhill, it's difficult to halt the momentum. So to apply this metaphor to the world of cinema, once a film franchise delivers a poor entry, it's almost impossible to not deliver poor ones from then on out. So, imagine the surprise when, after the lackluster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, that screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio and director Gore Verbinski are able to deliver a superior third entry in the Pirates series with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. It is hardly perfect, still far too long and lacking in emotional depth, but for a summer spectacle, it still manages to deliver the goods to a degree.At World's End opens not long after Dead Man's Chest, with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) joining forces with recently resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' locker, where he was dragged to by the Kraken at the conclusion of the last film. While they are on their way to the afterlife, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), has exerted his influence over Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and is using him to bring the pirates of the world to their knees. With their very existence on the line, the pirate lords meet to discuss the possibility of joining forces to combat Beckett, but since these are pirates, there is a wide variety of skullduggery and backstabbing to be had.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is rife with dazzling visuals. As with both previous films, At World's End has spent it's almost-certainly astronomical budget on what actually goes on the screen. The sets, costumes, and stunning visual effects are impressive, to say the least. You might be excused for actually believing that what you are seeing is real at times, not just movie trickery. The make-up artists have also once again proved that they can be the go to guys for the creation of unappealing looking characters, as almost no one in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End looks like they have taken a bath or brushed their teeth, well, ever, which, in this case, seems to work for the film. If you want to see a visually spectacular motion picture, especially on the big screen, you need look no further than At World's End.On the other hand, if you are interested in depth to go along with the glittery outside, then At World's End will prove to be somewhat lacking, although not nearly as much as Dead Man's Chest. The key problem to this film is that the characters are underdeveloped. Most of what makes them up is played out again without much added to the proceedings from the previous entries: Jack wants everything for himself, Barbossa wants what Jacks wants also, Will wants Elizabeth and Elizabeth wants, seemingly, to be a pirate. Frankly, it's a bit sad that the character with one of the best emotional arcs in the film is one of its villains, Davy Jones, who has an almost touching degree of pathos added to him thanks to a scene about halfway through the film. Perhaps it is the film's never ending attempt to keep the audience uncertain where the various characters loyalties lie that also works against the audiences' identification with almost anyone. When it seems that everyone is out only for themselves, it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for them.The film's cardinal sin, as has been the case with every Pirates entry thus far, is its bloated length. At World's End does not have nearly the lopsided running time to substance ratio that Dead Man's Chest did, but it still overstays it's welcome. Much like fellow summer blockbuster Spider-Man 3, the filmmakers seem to believe that bigger is better, and that is sometimes just not the case. In the film's defense, there is quite of bit of plot to fill the minutes, but it could have still been trimmed back to some degree while maintaining, and perhaps even increasing, the entertainment value.That being said, At World's End still manages a few surprises, and the ending does pay off much of what has gone before, and even though the 'love' between Elizabeth and Will seems almost non-existent, a key scene at the end on a beach does manage to be effective. The actors also generally deliver once again. Johnny Depp is entertaining as ever as Jack Sparrow, although he finds the screen time a bit split amongst the various other characters this outing. Depp seems to be having a good time in the role, and it's hard to not understand his public statements that he would be willing to go more rounds as the character. Rush is also effective as Barbossa and Keira Knightley shows a bit more energy than in the last entry, as does Orlando Bloom in the part of Will.So, what began as a seemingly bad idea (a Disney theme park ride turned into a summer film) has concluded three films later with one of biggest displays of blockbuster film-making, in terms of scope, as has been seen in recent years. That the spectacle isn't quite in service of an appropriate amount of core material is disappointing, but Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is hardly a loss. It provides a decent amount of entertainment, buckets of eye candy and a good laugh here and there. While filmmakers should perhaps aspire to more, what they manage deliver isn't half bad. I suppose that might sound like damning with faint praise, but you just have to call them as you see them.",7,119,216,29 May 2007
X-Men," X-Men are X-celent
","X-Men is one of Marvel's oldest superhero teams, launched in the early 1960's. A comic interpretation of a ethnic or racial group that is met with bigotry, hatred and intolerance, X-Men continued Marvel's tradition of featuring heroes that were decidedly more down to earth than their DC Comics brethren. It took years of development to bring the mutant superheroes to the big screen, but it was finally tackled by director Bryan Singer, who made a big splash with his sleeper cult hit, The Usual Suspects. As realized by Singer and his screenwriter collaborators Tom DeSanto and David Hayter, X-Men would bring comic book adaptations into a more realistic world than the ones that Batman had played in in the 1990s, and successfully launch Marvel comics into a string of strong adaptations that continues to this day.In the universe the X-Men inhabit, small numbers of humans have begun to show evolutionary mutations. Some of these mutations manifest themselves in the form of physical deformities, such as different skin coloring, scales or extreme sizes. Others appear normal, but possess powers that make them superhuman such as extreme healing abilities, control of temperature and the weather, and walking through solid objects. Normal humans view the mutants with fear and trepidation, shunning them and forcing mutants to live in hiding and with shame. As X-Men opens, we are shown a flashback scene in which young mutant Eric Lensherr, aka Magneto, reveals his powers to control metal objects when he is separated from his parents at a German concentration camp during World War II. When he grows up, his experience with intolerance at the hands of the Germans has ingrained in him a strong distrust for human society in general. When crusading Senator Kelley (Bruce Davison) decides to introduce the Mutant Registration Act, which would force all mutants to be identified by the government, Magneto (played as an adult by Ian McKellan) has determined that no mutant will ever be marked as he was as a child and plans to fight back.Simultaneously, a young teenage girl, Marie, aka Rogue (Anna Paquin), has just discovered her power, which is to take the life energy out of any person she touches. This revelation comes to her when she first kisses her boyfriend, leaving him in a coma. Fearful of her powers, she runs away from home and in a small town in Canada discovers a fellow mutant, loner Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Wolverine has advanced healing abilities, and is also equipped with a skeleton covered in a material called Adamantium, a metal that is indestructible, along with three sharp claws imbedded in his hands that he can unleash at a moments notice. Rogue and Wolverine are attacked by mutants working for Magneto and are saved by the X-Men, the name of a team of elite mutants that have been trained to use their powers for good by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who founded a school for mutants in New York. The key members of the X-Men are Cyclops (James Marsters), who can shoot energy beams from his eyes, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who has telekinetic powers and Storm (Halle Berry) who can control the weather. Professor Xavier believes that Magneto wants Wolverine for some purpose, so he is determined to hide him at all costs and prevent a plan Magneto has to convert normal humans into mutants.X-Men is very much an allegorical story, depicting man's intolerance to that which he finds different. This gives X-Men a dramatic strength many other comic book stories lack, which are often a bit too wrapped up in their fantasy material. Singer and crew have made a good decision to ground X-Men in, essentially, the real world. New York is New York, there are the references to the Holocaust which provides a good basis for Magneto's hatred and the characters are smart enough to find the trappings of the comic book world they are in a bit ridiculous (In one scene, as the X-Men introduce themselves to Wolverine with their code names, he snickers and says 'This is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.').On the character front, X-Men does suffer a bit from an overload of characters. Storm, Professor Xavier and Magneto's henchmen suffer from lack of development because there just isn't enough screen time for everybody. On the flip side, Wolverine, Rogue and Magneto are fleshed out to a decent degree, allowing us to become familiar with them and involved in their story. This imbalance of character development would haunt the future X-Men sequels as well.X-Men was a film that had the potential to be a budget buster, so some care was taken to not overload the film with visual effects and as a result, X-Men looks a little low budget and underwhelming compared to it's bigger budget successors. The action sequences are kept to a minimum, but the film is not completely lacking in it's quota of fisticuffs. The special effects are decent, but noticeably restrained, so as to keep the film in check. In some ways, this restraint is almost better, as it allows X-Men to look to something other than eye candy to fill it's running time, leaving more room for the issues and characters.X-Men would prove to be a popular comic book translation and Marvel used it to launch itself into superstardom after that, following up with Spider-Man two years later. While it has some flaws, X-Men is a good entry in the genre and one that set the tone for good adaptations to follow.",8,1,1,5 June 2006
Milk," You should drink this Milk
","Make no mistake: With Milk, the new biopic by director Gus Van Sant and starring Sean Penn in the lead role as Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to public office, Penn has proved once again what a masterful actor he is. Milk is a strong film for the most part, but Penn puts it over the top with his turn as the insurance executive turned political activist. There are many things to recommend Milk, but Penn is at the center of them all.Opening in 1970, Milk introduces us to Harvey as he meets Scott Smith (James Franco) in New York. The two become lovers and elect to move to San Francisco and become hippies while embracing the growing openly gay culture that is alive in the city. After opening a photo shop in the Castro area and seeing the prejudice that homosexuals face, Milk becomes a political activist and runs for city supervisor. After losing the race multiple times, Milk manages to pull a coup when the city's districts are remade and finds himself elected to office.At the same time as Harvey is assuming his new responsibilities, there is a significant anti-gay fervor that seems to be sweeping the country, led by religious activist Anita Bryant, championing legislature in several counties and cities in the US that strips gays of their civil rights. To combat these efforts, Harvey continues to assemble his followers into a powerful political force. However, closer to home, Harvey is challenged by a fellow city supervisor, Dan White (Josh Brolin), who is struggling with personal demons that will prove to be tragic.Milk is a relatively straightforward biographical film, not really deviating from what we would expect for this kind of picture. That, however, does not detract from it's overall success. Milk is an affecting film, dealing with the issues of discrimination and intolerance and showing that sometimes, one man can make a difference. Of course, the centerpiece is Penn as Milk. During the film's end credits, Van Sant shows a clip of Penn as Milk that dissolves to the real Milk, and the mannerisms blend seamlessly. Penn fully embodies the character, creating a man who was serious about his activism, but yet approached most everything with a somewhat lighthearted touch. You believe in Penn as Milk completely, and it is difficult to imagine that Penn won't receive yet another nod from the Academy for his performance early next year.Van Sant also touches on issues of political power, showing how individuals can be organized to push a movement, against all odds, but he doesn't shy away from the sometimes less pleasant aspects of politics, hinting at the corruption of power and the willingness of politicians to bend their word to get what they want. The film also deals with what Harvey gives up in his personal life to gain his political goals, seeing more than one lover leave because of their inability to take second place in Harvey's life to the movement he devotes himself to. In some ways, Milk is a tragic story.As the troubled Dan White, Josh Brolin delivers an understated performance of a man trapped by times and things he can't completely understand, and the film also suggests that he may have been homosexual himself and has buried that aspect of himself under a 'cloak' of normalcy. In many of the scenes between Harvey and White there is almost an air of sexual tension that gives greater credence to the actions of White later in the picture. Emile Hirsch gives a strong performance as Cleave Jones, who starts out as a man just looking for a good time to someone who begins to believe in the cause as much as Harvey. Franco is also good as long suffering lover Scott, who is unable to cope with Harvey's focus on the movement and the toll it takes on their relationship. Diego Luna is amusing at times as Jack, someone Harvey takes in, but the part proves a bit underwritten.Milk delivers an affecting and involving story of the fight against injustice and the man who was it's spark, which is all the strong due to Penn's outstanding performance. After two hours in the theater, you will believe you have met and spent time with Harvey Milk.",8,4,9,13 December 2008
The Prestige," A 'Prestige'ous film
","The Prestige is a film, ostensibly, about illusion. But, in truth, it is more about maintaining the illusion at all costs, and how that illusion is used as a tool and excuse for the most destructive and obsessive of behavior. Director Christopher Nolan's follow up to the much heralded Batman Begins, The Prestige is not as good as that film, but it is still an entertaining and, at times, challenging romp.Set in the waning years of the 1800s, The Prestige focuses on two stage magicians, Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They are assistants to another magician, learning the craft, but they are both striving to make their own way in the magic world. After an accident during a performance kills Angier's wife (Piper Perabo), and is ostensibly Borden's fault, the two part ways and begin feuding with each other, sabotaging the other's performances in vicious and violent ways in a constant game of one-upsmanship. When Borden reveals his signature trick, dubbed The Transported Man, Angier, along with assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) and ingenieur Cutter (Michael Caine), develop their own version of the trick, but that isn't enough for Angier, who is convinced that Borden is not using the traditional methods for such a trick (the application of a double, Angier's way),and sends Olivia to spy on him, eventually finding himself on a trip to America to discover the truth of Borden's act.In keeping with Nolan's repertoire to date, The Prestige is a film about individuals who are not the most stable or well-adjusted. These are men who have sacrificed everything, those they love, their health and more to constantly stay one step ahead of the other. The live in a world of illusion, fueled by the desire to keep the other guessing and to hear the thrill of the audience when they have pulled off a good trick. Both Angier and Borden are tragic characters, neither really has much of a bright side, and even when they find some happiness, the pull of their obsession, and other hidden secrets, keep them from enjoying it. You can credit Nolan and his co-writer, brother Jonathan, for not failing to follow this dark subject matter to its eventual conclusion. At the same time, The Prestige is hardly an upbeat film, and these are dark men living dark lives, so it would be easy to see some audience members turned off by the uncompromising nature of this film.The Prestige falls a little short of fleshing out the relationships with Angier and Borden's significant others, in Angier's case Olivia and for Borden, wife Sarah (Rebecca Hall). There is a little more depth to the Borden/Sarah pairing, as she realizes that as much as she loves him, she will always come second to his magic and feud. The relationship between Angier and Olivia is much more shallow, and Johansson proves to have an almost cameo level role, not making much of an impression in the grand scheme of the film.For fans of Christopher Priest's novel, the meat of the story is there, but the modern day framing device has been removed. However, the Nolans have maintained one significant aspect of the book, the telling of a majority of the story through one character's reading of the other's notes and journals. Nolan uses this to play with chronology, as he did in Memento, but not to the same degree as in that groundbreaking film, and the audience should have no difficulty following what is happening.All the actors are in good form, especially Bale and Jackman. They sell the dark feud between these men well, but also their fascination with magic. While Bale has what seems the showier role, Jackman actually stands out greater in this film, playing a role that is a little different than what he has tackled previously. Caine is his usual reliable best as Cutter, a minor character in the novel blown up to a larger part here. The film has a strong, distinguished look that sells the period well, with great cinematography by Wally Pfister.The Prestige isn't Christopher Nolan's crowning achievement, it is a little under Memento and Batman Begins, but overall it is a good show that is worth enjoying. Just don't believe everything you see.",8,1,2,7 November 2006
Blade II," Sharpen this Blade
","Many individuals have raised the issue that it is rare to find a sequel that matches the quality of the original, let alone surpasses it. On that short list, you should find the film Blade II. The sequel to the 1998 vampire action flick is more stylish, more exciting and scarier than it's predecessor, making it a solid entry in the comic-book adaptation pantheon.Opening some time after the conclusion of the original, we find our hero Blade (Wesley Snipes) searching for his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), whom the vampires converted to a vampire and kidnapped. Shortly after locating and curing Whistler of his vampirism (using some complicated retro-virus magic serum), two vampire ninjas drop in on his hideout, but not to kill him. The vampire nation is seeking Blade's assistance in ridding them of a new mutant strain of vampire, dubbed the Reapers. You don't want to mess around with the Reapers: aside from being impervious to silver and many of the other standard vampire repellents, they have a nasty habit of splitting their lower jaw in half and sucking you dry in a much less appealing way than normal vampires.Blade joins forces with a elite group of vampires that were trained to hunt him down, the Bloodpack, led by Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) and Nyssa (Leonore Varella), daughter of the leader of the vampires, Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). Blade and the Bloodpack begin hunting the Reapers, but it quickly becomes obvious that they have an agenda that goes beyond stopping these mutants.A big component in the improvement of Blade II over Blade has to do with the presence of director Guillermo Del Toro. Director of several stylish horror films, he brings a more unique flair to the proceedings. The film is darker, with harsher shadows and moodier lighting than the last entry. The action sequences are also well choreographed, using computer generated imagery that generally integrates well into the live action to add an extra kick to them.Unlike Blade, Blade II also has a stronger element of horror to it. This is principally attributable to the presence of the Reapers. The standard vampire in a horror film is rather passé these days; the Reapers, however, are not. It's easy to see that the Reapers are representative of any major disease, be it AIDS, bubonic plague, etc. They are hairless, light skinned, and will feed on anything that moves. The scenes where they attack en masse are reminiscent of such films as Night of the Living Dead, although with a little more kick to them than the slow, shuffling zombies of that black and white classic. Where the vampires in Blade were not that scary, save for the film's opening, the Reapers are and add an extra level to Blade II missing from the original.Wesley Snipes is back in fine form as Blade. Still not graced with an overabundance of dialogue, Snipes imbues the character with a little more attitude than the first time around, making Blade a character that is easier to sympathize with. Ron Perlman turns in his usual solid performance as Reinhardt, taking the role of central villain for the piece. Kristofferson is also his curmudgeonly self as Whistler, and his presence is welcome.It is always refreshing to see filmmakers take a decent film and liberally expand and improve on it with a quality sequel, which seems in short supply these days. Blade II manages the break the curve, and if you were a fan of the original, the sequel is more than worth your time.",8,1,11,31 March 2006
Horrible Bosses," Funny, falling a bit short of hilarity
","You have to wonder these days if Hollywood has any ability to make more than two kinds of comedy films. The first is the supremely juvenile kid film, targeted so blatantly at children that parent's groan at the thought of their little ones wanting to go to the movies. The second category, arguably born with There's Something About Mary, is what I call the 'Shock Comedy', films that try to push the boundaries of good taste and civility to its breaking point. Horrible Bosses definitely falls into the latter category, but proves to be an entertaining, if somewhat underwhelming, example of the genre. It isn't quite as lewd as other films of its style, and manages to deliver a decent number of laughs, but I doubt anyone will be singing its praises a few years from now.Horrible Bosses rides on the casting of its three titular bosses: Dave (Kevin Spacey), whose seemingly whole purpose in life is to make Nick's (Jason Bateman) life a complete living hell, forcing him to work long hours and endure psychological torture with the promise of a promotion at the end of the tunnel. Bobby (Colin Farrell) is the coke-addled son of Kurt's (Jason Sudeikis) beloved long-time employer (Donald Sutherland) who takes over the company after the elder dies of a heart attack and is exclusively interested in riding the white horse, partying with strippers, and siphoning off as much profit from the business as possible to make his dream life of endless partying possible. Finally, there is Julia (Jennifer Aniston), the dentist who employs Dale (Charlie Day), but also has her eye on using Dale as her own personal sex toy, constantly taunting him with potential faked blackmail she will use against his fiancé if he doesn't do the horizontal tango with Julia prior to his wedding day.Nick, Kurt and Dale have decided their individual situations are no longer tolerable, and have decided to take matters into their own hands: they decide that the world will be better off without their bosses in it. Not initially interested in getting their hands dirty, the trio stumble upon a 'murder consultant', in the guise of one Mr. Jones (Jamie Foxx), first name not to be featured in a mixed company forum. He suggests that they off each other's superior, a la Strangers on a Train or Throw Momma From the Train (depending on your film knowledge). The group starts out with reconnaissance, then eventually things get unexpectedly out of control, leading to some sticky situations for the friends.With the potential of Spacey, Farrell and Aniston selling the premise, and its murder driven plot, Horrible Bosses has the potential for a black comedy, but only vaguely dips its toes in the pool of the that genre. Instead, it only briefly touches on the depth of the darkness possible, but mostly keeps the overall situation light, well, as light as an R-rated comedy can get. Some of this is helped by the likability of the protagonists. Nick, Kurt and Dave, as portrayed by Bateman, Sudeikis and Day, are relatively nice guys, stuck in bad situations, and only turning to their particular resolution out of a sense of desperation. Even Jones has an air of frivolity to him, despite the prominent head tattoos and off-putting first name. Horrible Bosses takes a peak behind the black comedy curtain, but never steps into the darkness.It does manage to wade a bit into the pool of the Shock Comedy, featuring such scenes as an initial meeting by the friends with a guy hired off the internet who is a specialist in 'wetwork' (you have to see the film to figure out what it means), a visit to his bosses bathroom by Kurt that ends a bit gross, and Aniston's Julia, who isn't afraid to push the boundaries of all her previous work far beyond what you expect of her. There are plenty of laughs to be had by the misadventures in the film, to be sure, although Horrible Bosses never quite crosses the line into hilarity. The film is funny to be sure, but it is never riotous, falling short of a great comedy that will tickle the funny bone for years to come.Spacey is at his mocking, depraved best as Dave, the boss who isn't afraid to let everyone else suffer while he makes his own life better. Spacey plays this kind of role well, and fits the character to a tee. Farrell shows promise as Bobby, but of the three, he is the most underutilized by the film. Some blooper materials in the credits suggest that there were more scenes with Bobby planned that got cut, which is too bad, as he provides some nice laughs in his limited scenes. But Aniston is arguably the standout, operating outside the type of role she has taken before, and giving Julia a mix of sexy and mean that is very effective. She turns into the boss you love to hate in this film. The friends are all well filled out by Bateman, Sudeikis and Day. Bateman, having seen a significant career upswing since Arrested Development, has been mastering the role of put-upon working stiff for several years, and gives his dependable best here. Sudeikis is the horn dog of the group, but still manages to have a degree of niceness to him. Day is the weird one, albeit not so weird to be off-putting. Of the three 'straight men', he delivers the most laughs. Finally, Foxx manages to put on a good show of parody and in-jokiness as Jones, making the most of his small part.Horrible Bosses is a decent comedy that has a sufficient number of laughs to make you leave the theater feeling entertained, but doesn't quite get let off the leash to soar higher. There are more than a few standout scenes, but manages to be just a good, not great, comedy.",7,0,0,29 July 2011
Nacho Libre," Not an excellent order of Nacho
","Whether you like Nacho Libre or not really comes down to this: If you found Napoleon Dynamite amusing, then you will most likely generally enjoy Libre. If, however, Dynamite's charms leave you dewildered, then Nacho Libre is probably not a good selection for a night at the movies.Nacho Libre has a rather uncomplicated plot: Brother Ignacio (Jack Black) is a friar at a Mexican orphanage who dreams of two things: providing better food for his young charges and becoming a famous wrestler (known in Mexico as a luchador). He also finds himself attracted to a new nun at the orphanage, Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera). Wrestling is looked down upon by his fellow friars as a sin, so Ignacio has held off on pursuing his dream. But, finally, with the assistance of a street waif named Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), Ignacio makes the move to become a luchador by hiding behind a mask and taking the name Nacho. Nacho and Esqueleto are not a successful pair, they lose consistently, but become beloved by the crowd and continue wrestling, while Ignacio tries in vain to win the heart of Encarnacion.Nacho Libre has a great deal in common with Napoleon Dynamite, the previous film directed by Jared Hess. Between camera angles, framing choices (Hess almost always shoots characters in the dead center of the screen, directly facing the camera) and a similar style of performance for many of the supporting characters, it wouldn't be incorrect to consider Nacho Libre Napoleon Dynamite's distant Mexican cousin. However, the presence of both Jack Black and co-screenwriter Mike White (who wrote School of Rock among other films) brings a different angle to some of the material, and at times, it's easy to see Black and White's influence on the film. Black performs Ignacio as a compromise of his usually boisterous self and one of Hess' open-mouthed, blank stare caricatures. Some of the occasional bits also have that crazy set piece mentality that has informed Black's previous work.The film has a decent amount of funny moments, from Ignacio and Esqueleto fighting two short wrestlers that look like trolls from hell to Ignacio's occasional left-field statements ('It sucks to be me right now!' he says at one point). However, Nacho Libre never really takes off. It is not exactly dry humor, but it is not exactly inspired either. And as ridiculous as some of the wrestling matches are, they aren't really over the top hilarious either. The film also has almost no real suspense at all: it is very much the typical sports underdog story, with the little guy trying his best to pursue his dream and never give up. The films progression is never in much doubt. The romance, if it can be called that, between Ignacio and Encarnacion is half executed and fairly weak, without a clear resolution at the end.So, is Nacho Libre worth seeing? It is funny at times, but not so much that it can obtain a whole-hearted recommendation. And it also suggests that when Jared Hess gets ready to make another movie, he needs to move outside the Napoleon Dynamite box and look for something new, perhaps not even a comedy. Considering how much of Nacho Libre looks like Napoleon Dynamite in Mexico, the audience may not come back for round three.",7,0,1,21 June 2006
Pacific Rim," What summer blockbusters should be more like
","Pacific Rim is a film that doesn't try to hide what it is. An updating of Japanese giant monster movies that first were all the rage in the 1950s, Pacific Rim tells a similar story with the benefit of much higher-end visual effects than was possible on the lower budgeted events of eras past. However, Pacific Rim, unlike many Hollywood summer blockbusters, doesn't really skimp on other elements that make for a good film, with attention to character and story along the way. No one will mistake Pacific Rim as a masterpiece, but no one ever said being a blockbuster meant you had to be a bad film.Set in the near future, the Earth has been under constant attack by giant monsters, named Kaiju, that are emerging from a dimensional rift on the floor of the Pacific ocean. To combat the Kaiju, the governments of the world have built the Jaegers, giant, multi-story robots, controlled by two pilots who have melded their minds to prevent the mental strain of manning the Jaegers from turning their brains to mush. One Jaeger pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) gave up the program years earlier when his brother, who was his Jaeger co-pilot, had been killed in a confrontation with a Kaiju. However, since then, the Kaiju have become more dangerous, and the various world leaders have decided to put all their energy into building a giant wall to surround the coastlines of the Pacific from the Kaiju. Marshall Pentecost (Idris Elba) does not believe that will prevent the Kaiju from destroying the planet, so he and the four remaining Jaegers are assembled at Hong Kong to lead a final charge against the Kaiju to stop them once and for all. To man one of the Jaegers, Pentecost has brought Raleigh back into the fold, teaming him up with Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) to help lead the battle, but Raleigh's troubled past, and emotional scars of Mako's own, make the success of the mission seem dubious.Pacific Rim's screenplay written by Travis Beacham and the film's director, Guillermo del Toro, assembles elements that have been well worn in countless other movies. The earth under attack from menacing alien forces, the reluctant hero, the final desperate charge of a rag tag band of survivors, there isn't hardly any aspect that hasn't been lifted from somewhere else. So, while Pacific Rim won't get an A for originality, del Toro and Beacham do an impressive job of assembling the pieces into an entertaining, engaging whole. One key thing del Toro does right is to not transform Pacific Rim into an action orgy, like the recent Transformers films. While you can't accuse Pacific Rim of being without action, the film isn't a constant slog through an endless cycle of action sequences. There is attention given to setting up the plot, and also to establishing the characters and their relationships to one another. Pacific Rim's strongest example of this is the development of Raleigh and Mako's partnership, with more than a hint of romance lurking beneath. The two actors have a distinct chemistry, and that comes across in their scenes together. Like most good movies, Pacific Rim knows that without strong characters, everything else is just a lot of empty sound and images.When the film does provide its action sequences, Pacific Rim largely delivers. It's prime set piece is a large scene about half-way through set in Hong Kong and the surrounding bay. The action is exciting, well staged, and full of energy. del Toro crafts this sequence to maximum effect, getting the adrenaline pumping. Filmmakers that want to see how to stage large scale action should look no further than this major scene. Pacific Rim isn't exactly perfect, though. Two scientist characters, portrayed by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, are intended to be comic relief, but their performances are so shrill and over the top, they quickly become annoying and off putting. del Toro also gives a small role to one of his regulars, Ron Perlman, as a Kaiju organ black marketeer, and while I always enjoy seeing Perlman pop up in anything, here he is largely filer, his character producing a smile at first, but, in the long run, not a very interesting role. Pacific Rim's ending is a bit underwhelming also, as the obvious parallels to other films robs the end of some of its energy. It doesn't ruin the movie, but a fresher conclusion would have been beneficial.Pacific Rim is the blockbuster Summer popcorn film that you generally wish more summer blockbusters would emulate rather than brain dead junk such as Transformers. By working in some nice character material, and allowing the film to breathe between action sequences, Pacific Rim manages to deliver a generally entertaining two hours at the movies. Its not groundbreaking or particularly deep, but for what it is, it delivers the goods.",7,2,6,28 July 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," Standard but strong comic-book origin story
","Since the release of Iron Man in 2008, Marvel Studios has been slowly moving towards assembling it's various superheroes in the upcoming super group film, The Avengers, to be released Summer 2012. The last piece of the puzzle in introducing the key members comes with the release of Captain America: The First Avenger, the oldest Marvel superhero, first introduced in comics in the 1940s. The film enjoyably keeps that original setting as part of Captain America's origin story in this film, and proves to be a solid, if not very inventive, introductory tale to Captain America.As previously stated, the film is set in the early 1940s, where Steve Rodgers (Chris Evans), a 99 pound asthmatic, has tried 5 times to enlist in the U.S. Army, failing each time due to his health. During his last attempt, he catches the eye of Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a German scientist that escaped Hitler's Nazi Germany to bring his super-soldier serum to help the U.S., designed to genetically enhance an army recruit to give him impressive strength and agility. Rodgers is successfully transformed by the formula, but a German spy kills Erskine and destroys the formula, leaving Rodgers as the only super-soldier to be produced.When the commanding officer of the super-soldier program, Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), wants to send him to be studied for replicating the formula, a U.S. Senator gives Rodgers an opportunity to support his country, but as the central attraction of a rolling U.S. War Bond tour, where the moniker Captain America is coined, as well as several staples of the Captain's outfit (the mask, a shield). When the tour takes Captain overseas, and a chance opportunity comes about to save his best buddy, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), from a POW work camp, Captain America takes on the challenge single-handedly, rescuing soldiers who end up forming the core of his team, the Howling Commandos, and also coming face to face with a villain far worse than Hitler: Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), also known as the Red Skull, who had used Erskine's serum before it was perfected, and while it gave him strength also, it has led to facial deformity that looks like, well, a Red Skull. Schmidt has hatched a scheme that will see him conquer the world with the power harnessed from an ancient artifact, and the military chooses to loose Captain America and his team to take Schmidt down.Captain America proves to be somewhat unique visually in context with recent comic book adaptations, set in the 1940s America and Europe, with a gorgeous looking style to it that differentiates it from the crowd. Director Joe Johnston, who directed The Rocketeer in the early 1990s, captures much of the same feel as that earlier film, brimming with a sense of timelessness of that era that proves charming. Captain America also capitalizes on the patriotic energy from World War II and embodies it in the character of Steve Rodgers, which almost seems impossible to imagine coming from any political climate since then. Overall, however, Captain America is generally a by the book comic origin story film, moving through the standard paces of this tale: introduction of the character in advance of his transformation of a super hero, set up the changes of him/her to their eventual alter ego, revelation of the villain with a connection to the hero, then a series of set pieces that lead to a showdown against the villain. Captain America doesn't really deviate from the path too much, but while it won't win any awards for originality within the comic book standard, Johnston and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, still deliver a solid entry in this sub-genre.Captain America does suffer a bit with its secondary characters, especially Rodgers friend Bucky Barnes and his other Howling Commandos, portrayed by reliable character actors such as Neal McDonough and Derek Luke, but they are all given the most minute amount of development, providing very little impact to the narrative at large, merely filling in parts of the screenplay that needed to be present, but living on the periphery of the story. Also, while Red Skull is one of the cornerstones of Marvel's pantheon of villainy, as presented here, he has a nice degree of James Bond-esque world domination to him, but doesn't come across as a villain that you can really develop a strong desire to see put down. Again, as with other parts of the film, he is presented as throwback to an earlier era of storytelling, but isn't quite as strong as expected.Captain America is helped along by some good performances from its main cast. Chris Evans gives Rodgers a strong sense of patriotism and a belief that he must step up to help his country, mixed with naiveté around women that gives him a nice streak of innocence. Unlike Tony Stark from Iron Man, Rodgers is very much a straight arrow with good intentions, and that feels right for the time the film is set in. Tommy Lee Jones practically steals the show with his delivery of the dialogue written for Colonel Phillips, using his personality best made famous from The Fugitive to give Phillips a degree of cynicism, but with good intentions beneath the curmudgeonly exterior. Haley Atwell gives her best interpretation of a Katherine Hepburn-like heroine from that era, although admittedly perhaps a bit too modern to be completely realistic. And Hugo Weaving provides the reliable over-the-top, but not too ridiculous, turn as Schmidt, making the Red Skull an appropriately megalomaniacal vibe.Captain America works for the most part, albeit falling a bit short of the top tier of Marvel movie, such as Iron Man. It is a good film overall, perhaps not groundbreaking, but still a nice introduction to a character that should live in The Avengers film and several sequels for years to come.",7,1,7,27 July 2011
Burn After Reading," A funny entry from the Cohens
","Following on the coat tails of their recent Oscar winner, No Country for Old Men, the creative film-making partnership of the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, return to somewhat more familiar territory with their most recent film, Burn After Reading, a comedy in their dark, twisted style. Burn After Reading is not one of the Coen's outstanding efforts, but it is more than amusing enough to warrant a recommendation.Burn After Reading starts it's focus on Oswald Cox (John Malkovich), a CIA analyst who has been reassigned from his position, for, among other things a 'drinking problem'. Infuriated with this decision, Oswald resigns from the CIA, annoying his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), and providing the catalyst for her to finally seek out a divorce so she can be with her lover, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney). Oswald decides to begin writing some memoirs in his now ample spare time, a disc copy of which is inadvertently left in the ladies locker room at a local gym, where it is discovered by Linda Lytzke (Frances McDormand) and her co- worker Chad (Brad Pitt). They decide to use the disc to blackmail Oswald for a significant sum of money so that Linda can pay for cosmetic surgery she so desperately wants.Burn After Reading can more or less be defined as a comedy, although in some ways it is not presented as one. Carter Burwell's score gives the film a generally serious tone, and the Cohen's are not afraid of taking chances that almost no other comedy would even think of doing. That being said, Burn After Reading is a pretty funny film, although it takes a little while for it to get going. There are some chuckles early in the running time, but this is one of those films that you have to build a bit before the laughs really start coming, and by the end, you are hooked.Much of the film's humor is provided by Brad Pitt in a somewhat out of type performance as dim-bulb personal trainer Chad. His endless preening, and over-the-top exuberance make for many a laugh in the film. George Clooney is also quite funny as sleazy ladies man Harry, who is a mixture or narcissism and infantilism, and Frances McDormand provides a number of amusing scenes a enhancement obsessed Linda.Burn After Reading is definitely a film that fits in the Cohen's oeuvre, similar in tone to their Intolerable Cruelty and Raising Arizona, although not quite as funny as either of those films. Even so, Burn After Reading still provides a considerable number of laughs and is a notch above many other comedies, making Burn After Reading worth a trip to the multiplex.",7,2,6,22 September 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," You say you want a Revolution
","With The Matrix Revolutions, The Matrix trilogy, begun in 1999, comes to an explosive conclusion and generally corrects course from the slightly underwhelming Matrix Reloaded sequel to bring the series back into fighting form. Some outstanding issues are still present that stops Revolutions short of matching the original Matrix, but it comes pretty close.Picking up right where The Matrix Reloaded left off, Revolutions finds Neo (Keanu Reeves) trapped in a limbo, realized as a train station, between the machine world and The Matrix. Meanwhile, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) are in search of Neo, consulting the Oracle (Mary Alice), who has been forced to alter her appearance (actress Gloria Foster, who portrayed the role in the first two films, had died in the interim). She directs them to the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) who reveals that Neo is trapped in his limbo, run by the Trainman (Bruce Spence). Upon freeing Neo, the battle begins heating up in the real world, with the machines almost to Zion, where the humans have massed all their might to hold them off. Neo realizes what path he must take to save Zion, while Morpheus and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) head back in the direction of Zion to help defend it from the machines. Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is nearing his almost total control of the Matrix, and his presence begins to threaten even the machines themselves.Where The Matrix Reloaded was the plot developing middle chapter of the trilogy, Revolutions is the grand epic finale, concluding with multiple major action sequences of a magnitude not seen in any of the Matrix films to date. Among the most significant is the machine siege on Zion, a whirlwind of visual effects that are as captivating as the sequence is exciting. Others have criticized this segment of the film, claiming it is just a computer game blown up to the big screen, but it is little different from the massive computer generated armies and battle sequences from the Star Wars prequels, so to dismiss it seems foolish. The quality of the effects is top notch, among some of the most detailed computer generated sequences realized to date, and while films shouldn't just be eye candy, this sequence also manages to capture the sense of desperation as the humans make their final stand against the machines. Occasionally, when the size of the tale calls for it, imagery on this grand of a scale is necessary.In fairness to the criticism of Revolutions, the film does not entirely pay off the elements set up in Reloaded. Once again, there are a lot of ideas on display in Revolutions, but it is difficult for writers-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski to completely tie everything up. Some aspects of the overriding plot are also left vague, but it may very well be on purpose, to give the viewer an opportunity to come to their own conclusions. Even so, there is some lingering questions that a little tighter screen writing would have helped with.Acting-wise, everyone still delivers as necessary. Reeves continues to turn in a sufficient performance as Neo, Carrie-Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne are dependable, and Hugo Weaving gets some of his best material as agent Smith. There are not standouts, but everyone is serviceable.With The Matrix Revolutions, the Wachowski brothers have brought their epic science fiction trilogy to a close, and while it may have dropped off a bit from it's strong start, The Matrix trilogy is still a challenging and entertaining masterwork, and should not be dismissed as callously by some as it has. Only time will tell the lasting power that this series may contain.",9,0,2,29 March 2006
Man of Steel," Superman film that isn't quite 'super'
","With box-office success and near universal acclaim of the recent Dark Knight reboot trilogy of films featuring Batman, it's not surprising that Warner Bros. would hand the reins of their other major tentpole superhero, Superman, to Christopher Nolan, the co-writer and director of the Dark Knight films. Nolan elected to serve as a producer and story writer, not director, for the film that has emerged, Man of Steel, and it's uncertain how much involvement he had, but one thing is certain, Man of Steel will most likely not have the lasting impact of the Dark Knight films. Directed by Zack Snyder and written by David Goyer, Man of Steel is very much a mixed bag, dealing in some interesting material concerning Superman's place in the modern world and in America today, but a lot of the film's strength is undercut by its later section, where it devolves into a seemingly endless string of overwrought action sequences that sap most of the entertainment out of the proceedings.The film revisits Superman's origin in it's opening scenes: Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara (Ayelet Zuer) give birth to Kal-El, the first natural birth the planet of Krypton has seen in over a millenia, where the population is engineered, not born through standard procreation. Kal-El's birth comes on the cusp of Krypton being destroyed by it's population over harvesting the planet's natural resources. At the same time, Krypton's military leader, General Zod (Michael Shannon), has decided to engage in a coup to wrestle control of the planet from it's leaders that Zod views as inept. Zod is put down, but not before Jor-El launches his son for Earth to escape Krypton's fate.On Earth, Kal-El is raised by a Kansas farmer and his wife, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, respectively). Jonathan tries to convince Kal-El, named Clark Kent, to keep his powers hidden from the world for fear of how the populace of Earth would react to knowing that an alien was in their midst. Clark grows up (portrayed by Henry Cavill as an adult) and begins wandering the world, uncertain of his place, but also managing to occasionally tip his hard regarding his abilities. Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) begins investigating the stories of Clark following an encounter with him at a dig site of an ancient alien ship that had arrived from Krypton many centuries earlier. On board that ship, Clark discovers the truth about his past from a projection of his father, and he dons his familiar blue and red suit. As Lois begins to close in on Clark's identity, an alien object appears in orbit and turns out to be General Zod and his followers who have managed to survive Krypton's destruction and come to Earth with plans to change the planet, plans that Clark has every intention of stopping.While Man of Steel does find itself in the unenviable position of revisiting the origin of Superman, Goyer and Snyder do a decent job of not repeating the same path as the original 1978 Superman film. Instead, following the prologue on Krypton, much of the material of Superman's formative years is presented in flashback after Clark has already reached maturity. To their credit, this decision makes the narrative a little more unpredictable. The flashbacks actually provide some of Man of Steel's best moments, as the characters of Jonathan and Martha Kent are given some of the strongest emotional material to work with for the film. Several of the scenes in which Clark finally discovers more about his past from the projection of his father are also engaging as we see Clark learn his past and begin to try to embrace who he is.However, as Man of Steel progresses, it fails to really dive into it's most interesting aspects with any depth. The film introduces the concept that, unlike most previous versions of the Superman story, the revelation of an otherworldly being living amongst us with super powers would not be welcomed with open arms, but distrust and fear. This approach, and Clark's isolation because of it, are ideas pregnant with possibility, but Man of Steel doesn't do a lot with them. Instead, once Zod and his minions are on Earth, Man of Steel transforms into wall to wall carnage, as we witness Clark and Zod face off in a number of environs where cities, trains, small towns, vehicles, you name it are decimated in an unending orgy of action that quickly wears out it's welcome. No one expects a super hero film to be without action, but Man of Steel cranks everything up to 11 and squelches the narrative underneath.Most of the characters suffer as a result of Man of Steel's transition to full-bore action film. Lois Lane is presented as a modern investigative reporter who begins to develop some affection for Clark as she unravels his past, but her relationship with him is largely stillborn, resulting in little emotional involvement to their growing affection. Michael Shannon's Zod has some interesting elements to his backstory, but he isn't fleshed out enough for us to really work up any significant distaste for him. Henry Cavill gives a good performance as Clark, and if given more opportunity to delve into the character in future films, he may prove a strong presence, but here there are only hints to some of the potential of this version of Superman. Almost all the other supporting characters aren't given enough screen time to be anything more than passing faces for the most part.It would be inaccurate to describe Man of Steel as a failure, there is good material here, the film simply transforms into too much action and not enough of anything else to truly soar. If Man of Steel is successful enough for a second film, with any luck the filmmakers will learn from their mistakes and create a truly stellar Superman film.",5,7,14,14 July 2013
The Thing," Strong horror film
","In the summer of 1982, audiences flocked to theaters to spend time with a visitor from outer space named E.T. Around the same time, another visitor for the depths of space was also stalking multiplexes, but he was far less warm and fuzzy as E.T., and went by the name The Thing. Although it was not a box-office success upon original release, John Carpenter's remake of the Hollywood horror classic has gone on to achieve cult success over the years, and stands as one of the scariest horror films I have seen to date.Based on a short story by famed science-fiction author John W. Campbell, Jr., entitled 'Who Goes There?', The Thing was brought to the screen in the 1950's by famed producer-director Howard Hawks in what is viewed as a seminal horror classic, although it heavily deviated from the source material, and generally doesn't stand up to scrutiny for modern audiences. When bringing a new version to the screen, Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster stuck closer to the source story and crafted a tale of paranoia and isolation that works on your nerves and rarely gives you a moment to relax throughout it's running timeSet at an American Antarctic research station in the dead of winter, The Thing opens with two Norwegian scientists from a nearby station chasing a dog across the barren wasteland in a helicopter, attempting to shoot it. They arrive at the American camp and in their attempt to kill the dog appear to attack the members of the American party and are themselves killed in the process. Curious about what would lead the Norwegian scientists to follow such a strange course of action, the American expedition's doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) and helicopter pilot Macready (Kurt Russell) make their way to the Norwegian camp and discover it destroyed and all members of the expedition dead, some in rather mysterious ways. They also come across a video recording of a recent dig the Norwegian's performed at a nearby site as well as a block of ice that was carved out of the ground and appears to have contained something approximately human-sized. Copper and Macready then investigate the dig site and discover a large saucer shaped space craft in the ice. They quickly determine that the object in the ice was a creature from another planet that was excavated and thawed out, and shortly thereafter, the dog that the Norwegian's were chasing reveals it's true nature: an alien shape-shifter that can take on any appearance it chooses, and can spread to multiple individuals at the same time, essentially replicating itself at will. Blair (Wilford Brimley), the lead scientist, upon discovery of this fact destroys the expedition's radio and all means of transport with the intention of ensuring that the alien does not spread to the outside world, knowing that if that were to happen, humanity itself would fall, replaced by replicating things.The Thing is, much like the classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a film that asks the most basic of questions: Can you trust the person sitting next to you? As realized by Carpenter and Lancaster, The Thing keeps you guessing and unsure of all the characters throughout the film, constantly putting them in situations that could lead to them being consumed by the thing, or just as easily not, leaving the audience unsure of who is human and who isn't. The tables are turned on characters several times through the film, causing our belief of who is and isn't infected to constantly be in a sense of motion. One of the film's strongest aspects is that most of the characters, while not supremely well defined, are given enough personality and individuality for us to root for them to come out of the ordeal alive, giving us a stronger stake in the events on screen. If we didn't care for these characters at all, the tension and suspense wouldn't work nearly as well.The film is also helped by a strong sense of isolation. Like many horror films, such as Alien, placing the characters in an environment with no way out gives you an even greater sense of unease, and you can feel how the characters are trapped by their surroundings, as well as by each other. One aspect of the Thing that was groundbreaking at the time was the make-up effects crafted by Rob Bottin. In the early '80s there was a rash of films that were based around elaborate make-up effects, and The Thing is one of the standouts. Almost all the make-up effects are spectacular and create the appropriate sense of revulsion and horror that they should. Some audience members will be turned away by the sometimes extreme nature of the effects, but they are actually much less bloody and disgusting than countless other horror films that came about as the decade went on. What is featured in The Thing does not feel gratuitous.Most of the performers in the Thing were character actors who were not big name stars, but they all do the job well. Kurt Russell, a longtime collaborator of Carpenter's, is effectively low-key and straight in the face of some rather incredible situations as the film progresses. He grounds us in the film and makes us believe what is happening on screen. Wilford Brimley is also notable for his performance as Blair, a man who understands the implications of the situation they are in and slowly goes mad because of it.While hardly the most original horror film, The Thing is an effective entry in the genre, and one that is worth seeing if you like being scared.",8,0,1,1 October 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A pleasant surprise
","Terminator 3:  Rise of the Machines was a film that had the potential to be a complete disaster.  The second sequel to a well-respected action film, lacking the presence of it's superstar original director (James Cameron), and the most recent film from an aging and recently hit-free action star (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  This is not to mention the 10+ year gap between this film and it's previous entry.  However, when the lights go down, Terminator 3 surprises.  It is, while hardly a masterpiece, an entertaining and engaging piece of action cinema, and perhaps the best action film of the year to date.Most people are familiar with the basic outline of the plot, which this sequel once again follows:  John Connor (Nick Stahl, replacing Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance against the machines that conquer the world, is 'living off the grid', with no phone number, no address, no attachments.  However, even though he believes that the future is safe after the destruction of the nascent supercomputer Skynet in Terminator 2, he still feels he should live in the shadows.  He is right. Skynet has once again decided to take a crack at eliminating his future adversary, and has sent back a new killing machine, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), to stop the future from turning out poorly for those composed of chips and software.  And, once again, the human resistance has decided to blow the dust off an obsolete model of human-killing metal, the T-101, who comes equipped with the rock-jawed visage of one Austrian body-builder.  He must protect not only Connor, but his future right-hand woman, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who is a little, um, reluctant, to believe she will lead the human race in a post-apocalyptic future to victory against sentient machines.  And she doesn't even get to take a pill to determine her fate.Where the film succeeds is in it's realization that it is, first and foremost, an action film.  It isn't interested in being much more than that, but it also is smart enough to not over-reach. It is fast-paced and well-constructed, and it handles itself effectively, full of action, but not seemingly over-done.  The film gets off to great start early on, with a spectacular multi-vehicle chase that rivals the Matrix Reloaded for sheer speed and audacity.  Featuring police cruisers, ambulances and a giant mobile crane, it is a stand-out sequence that few action films this year can really top.Jonathan Mostow, the director, has some big shoes to fill, replacing the 'King of the World', but he takes charge of the film well, allowing it all to flow effectively.  One major element of the film's success is the performance of Kristanna Loken as the T-X.  Like Robert Patrick before her, she is effectively distant, giving her T-X a cold demeanor belied by her rather comely exterior.  She gives the character a fluid sense of motion that is half animal, half machine.  And, while some may have believed that having a female antagonist would be destined to fall into the bimbo or super-bitch category, the screenwriters have crafted some scenes that display the value of a female killing machine in a male dominated world (a scene where police officer pulls her over and she uses her liquid metal exterior to craft larger breasts is one example).  She is every bit Schwarzenegger's match.And speaking of the aforementioned superstar, Schwarzenegger is able to shake off his recent failures and is back in top form with Terminator 3.  He fits the role perfectly again, and this time the screenwriters have decided to have some fun with him, giving him some neat one-liners that are, unlike seemingly similar material in the abysmal Batman & Robin, genuinely funny. The character is not a self-parody, but a little looser than before.One aspect that put Terminator 2 over the top in terms of memorability was it's then ground-breaking use of computer animation to craft it's villain, and it would be reasonable to assume Terminator 3 would try to top it. However, Mostow and crew have realized that they can't really compete with what has come recently, and don't even try.  This works beautifully though. Instead of being distracted by constant bombardment of eye-candy, the film rides on it's stunt sequences and action set-pieces, and this is the right approach I think.  There are visual effects on display here, and they are expertly well-done, and pretty seamlessly integrated into the film. 
Terminator 3 is not a film that will redefine cinema as we have come to know it, and has it's occasional gaps in logic and credibility, but nothing so glaring that it is distracting.  It simply does the job it was designed to do, and does it well.  What more can an audience ask.",7,0,0,14 July 2003
Over the Hedge," Hedge your bets on fun
","The computer animated film has become to film studios what Mike Tyson was in the ring in the 1980's: a sure thing. You knew that when Tyson walked in the ring, somebody else was going down, and probably rather quickly. The same is true of most computer animated comedies these days: it is near sure to be a mix of material targeted at children and adults, feature lots of star voices and be entertaining, for the most part at least. Over the Hedge, the latest offering from Dreamworks, does not disappoint on any of the above fronts, and proves to be one more notch in computer animations belt.The film opens on loner raccoon R.J. (Bruce Willis) who has made the mistake of raiding the hibernation supplies of Vincent the bear (Nick Nolte). After managing to lose all of Vincent's food, R.J. is given an ultimatum: he has one week to replace it all, or he will become a bear snack. R.J. then manages to stumble across a group of animals that hibernate together, Vern the turtle (Gary Shandling), Stella the skunk (Wanda Sykes), Ozzie the possum (William Shatner) and his daughter Heather (Avril Lavigne), Lou (Eugene Levy) and Penny (Catherine O'Hara) the porcupines and their brood, and Hammy the squirrel (Steve Carell). The clan has discovered that while in hibernation, their forest was developed into a residential neighborhood and has left them with only a small patch of land to gather food from.R.J. appears and decides to take advantage of the situation: he will show the family how to raid the houses just on the other side of the hedge that separates their small patch of woodlands from the development, and when they have gathered everything together, he plans to take it all back to Vincent. Vern proves skeptical of R.J., but the rest follow along, and Vern begins to feel jealous about R.J.'s newfound place in their hearts. Meanwhile, the head of the development's association, Gladys (Allison Janney) has called in an exterminator (Thomas Hayden Church) to take care of this new infestation problem.Over the Hedge is about as broad based as entertainment comes: it features lots of cute, cuddly animals who perform elaborate hijinks for kids to laugh at, while offsetting this with some more adult oriented jokes and situations for the older set. Over the Hedge is a little less successful at this blending than some other films, such as Monsters, Inc. or Shrek. It is a bit more child oriented, relying on cuter gimmicks than some of it's brethren. It doesn't prove to be off-putting, the film is still more than entertaining for adults, it's just not quite as sophisticated as some that have come before.Plot-wise, Over the Hedge is about as predictable as they come: the outsider looking out for numero uno who gets his heart melted with the kindness of a new family unit he has found. This contributes to the more child centric feeling to the film; many children may not have seen this played out as often as adults, so the material may seem fresher. Over the Hedge manages to combat this weakness by being consistently funny for most of it's running time. There are plenty of good jokes, gags and situations to leave most audience members laughing a good bit of the time (and in the end, isn't that what a comedy is about).Voice-wise, most of the parts are fittingly cast. Bruce Willis has just the right amount of wiseguy smarts in his voice to sell cynical, self-centered loner R.J., Gary Shandling has the perfect combo of worry and parental concern, and Steve Carell brings a degree of hyper intensity to Hammy. Nick Nolte is also near-perfect for a bear's growly voice and Thomas Hayden Church really fills out the exterminator.Over the Hedge probably won't go down as a great entry in computer animated history, but it does it's job well enough to be entertaining, enjoyable and funny. Again, sometimes, what more can you ask?",7,12,12,5 June 2006
Wanted," A thrill ride that is 'Wanted'
","In the summer action movie sweepstakes, Wanted is the prize winner. Based on a six-issue comic series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, Wanted provides the appropriate thrills, action and engagement needed for a strong summer movie extravaganza.Wanted focuses on Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), a nobody in a minor, dead-end job with an overbearing boss and a best friend who is getting horizontal with Wesley's girlfriend during lunch breaks. However, when picking up a prescription one day, Wesley is greeted by Fox (Angelina Jolie), who informs him he is the son of a great assassin who was just murdered by another assassin, and is now the killer's target. She takes him on a whirlwind chase, and then introduces him to Sloan (Morgan Freeman), the head of the Fraternity, an order of assassins a thousand years old. Sloan informs Wesley that he has the same potential to be a superb assassin as his father, and thus leads to Wesley standing up to his boss, his girlfriend, his friend and beginning his training to become a member of the Fraternity.Wanted exudes much of the same energy as The Matrix, as well as sharing a similar visual flair, without necessarily ripping off the former film. When the action sequences kick in, they are a rather spectacular sight to behold, featuring a great deal of stylization and visual acrobatics that astonish supremely. Yes, the logic behind many moments in Wanted is completely nonexistent, featuring such elements as 'curving' bullets and killers so trained that they can manage to shoot a weapon with the exact trajectory to stop another oncoming bullet. But that doesn't really matter, Wanted grabs you when necessary and you just come along for the ride. The film is also helped along by some very strong visual effects that blend rather seamlessly with the surrounding live-action material.Wanted, much like the early summer success Iron Man, also understands that to really get into a story, we have to be involved in the characters, and with Wanted, our entry point is Wesley. He starts out as a character almost all of us can identify with, the downtrodden cog in the machine, coasting through his days with a feeling of inevitability and hopelessness. By letting us feel sympathy for Wesley, we have a rooting interest in what happens later, and therefore are involved in the film's action.James McAvoy gives us a vulnerable character in the form of Wesley at the beginning of Wanted, who then transforms into an assassin, but we never lose our identification with him. Angelina Jolie doesn't have a whole lot of dialogue, but makes an impression as Fox nonetheless. Morgan Freeman fills his character with a mixture of both authority and menace, proving once again what a masterful actor he is.Wanted is nothing tremendous on the plot front, it doesn't offer the audience anything too deep, but that is not necessary. It is a summer thrill ride, and at that, it succeeds exceptionally.",8,26,47,7 July 2008
Van Helsing," A textbook guilty pleasure
","Many of us have, as children, engaged in the fascination of pitting various different fictional beloved characters against each other in a variety of scenarios. 'What if Superman fought Spider-Man?' Van Helsing is the big-budget silver screen treatment of one of those scenarios, involving three of the biggest horror icons in film history, Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. These three legends have been tossed into the blender, along with a mix of special effects, elaborate production design and action, then writer-director Stephen Sommers hit puree resulting in something, which, while not a masterpiece, does have the capability to entertain.Although billed as a modern updating of the Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s, Van Helsing has very little in common with those films. They were low-budget mood pieces, cultivated by a studio which, as a 'major minor' (i.e. a studio with no theater chain), couldn't afford to make the big event films that competitors such as MGM was churning out in those days. The horror film was also custom built for Universal's talent base, many of whom had a German film background and were steeped in German expressionism, featuring harsh shadows and dark subject matter. Van Helsing, on the other hand, while maintaining some of the look of those old films, is a hyped-up action film, lacking much in the way of any scares, no suspense to speak of, and enough money obviously being spent to fund a small country.The film opens with a sequence filmed in black and white, proving Sommers does have an understanding of where the roots of his film come from. The prologue features Dr. Frankenstein bringing his creature to life, under the watchful eye of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburg). When Dr. Frankenstein isn't happy with the plans Dracula has for his creation, Dracula kills him and the monster flees, only to be trapped in a nearby windmill which is burned to the ground by an angry mob of villagers. The film then introduces us to our hero, hunting down one Mr. Hyde in the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral, a double homage to both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. After dispatching Hyde, Van Helsing, working for a secret organization representing all religions of the world, is ordered to Transylvania to assist the dying Valerious clan, who has sworn a pact to never enter heaven until Dracula is destroyed, and of whom only two are left, sister and brother Anna (Kate Beckinsale) and Velkan. In Transylvania, Van Helsing, accompanied by a medieval version of Q, Friar Carl (David Wenham), discovers that Dracula is planning to use the research of Dr. Frankenstein to bring his undead children to life, not to mention that Velkan has been transformed into a werewolf by Dracula, and that Frankenstein's monster has survived and is being hunted by Dracula.As with The Mummy and The Mummy Returns before it, Van Helsing is a film that has it's tongue firmly planted in it's cheek. You can never really take anything too seriously at any point in the film, it all has a light air to it. Many have been turned off by this aspect of the film, but I didn't find it distracting. Sure, it's not Shakespeare, but it also isn't total camp either. It's absolutely ridiculous, yes, but Sommer's energy and desire to have a good time is infectious, and the film was just fun to watch.Van Helsing is wall-to-wall action from start to finish. Thre is little time to take a breath in between one major set-piece and the next, so those looking for a slow-paced film had best look elsewhere. Van Helsing is all chases, fights, shoot-outs and brawls, and yet, unlike films from uber-action director Michael Bay, the action sequences never really get boring. Perhaps it's because they are all unique in one sense or another, with Sommers never really repeating something after using it once. The action sequences are top notch also, well choreographed and exciting. If you are in search of a good action film, Van Helsing would fit the bill on this level.Van Helsing also features stunning production design. I have always been a fan of Gothic horror film imagery, and this film is bathed in it. From the castles, to the costumes, to the weaponry, it's a feast for the eyes and should be in contention for the art direction award come Oscar season.Acting wise, Van Helsing is a mixed bag. Hugh Jackman equits himself well enough, managing to stay believable while surrounded by strange sights and sounds. Kate Beckinsale, as Anna, doesn't fare quite as well. Her accent and sometimes overblown reactions to what's happening on screen help make her one of the less impressive performers in the film. Richard Roxburg is a bit over the top at times with his accent and mannerisms, but the material pretty much calls for it. The worst example of actors pushing the limits are Dracula's three brides (Elena Anaya, Sylvia Colloca and Josie Maran) who are constantly writhing, hissing, spitting and just generally making a nuisance of themselves. They could have been toned down considerably.Van Helsing is a film that would be filed in the area of 'guilty pleasure.' There is stuff here to criticize, but at the same time, I can't help but enjoy myself while watching it, and in the end, isn't that all that matters.",7,2,4,23 April 2005
The Amazing Spider-Man," A decent series reboot
","It was only ten years ago that Spider-Man, the first cinematic adaptation of one of Marvel's crown jewel characters, was released to generally strong critical notices and boffo box-office. After two additional entries, the 2nd being another hit, the 3rd dropping a bit in quality, Sony Pictures and original helmer Sam Raimi couldn't see eye to eye on future entries, so Raimi walked away, and Sony elected to follow in the footsteps of James Bond and Batman and 'reboot' the franchise only five years since the last entry. This would prove to be a controversial choice with many (I have at least one friend who said he had no interest in seeing the reboot), but I was willing to give this new entry the benefit of the doubt. In general, I can say I was glad I did. The new entry, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, is a fairly strong film for the most part. Sporting a good turn in the lead by Andrew Garfield and an expanded focus on the relationship between Peter and his first girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, The Amazing Spider-Man manages to vindicate itself from those who might doubt it.The Amazing Spider-Man does re-hash the origin story that most are probably familiar with at this point, albeit with some new twists on the material. In this incarnation, Peter Parker is left with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) under mysterious circumstances by his parents in the middle of the night in the opening scenes of the film. When the narrative jumps forward to the present, Peter is a gawky outsider, imagined as both a science nerd but also a bit of a teenage rebel, riding a skateboard and slightly flaunting authority. When he discovers a briefcase of his father's in the basement, Peter begins asking questions about his father's work, which leads him to Oscorp, the company his father worked for. There, he encounters Dr. Chuck Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner, and the two begin working to complete Peter's father's work. However, the research into genetic regeneration has a dark side, as it would appear that it is intended to be used by Norman Osborne, the unseen head of the company, as a tool to help save his life, and who seems to know something about the reason Peter's parents disappeared.Upon his first visit to Oscorp, Peter happens into a room where testing is being performed on spiders, and one manages to bite him. The result, of course, is that the spider bite imbues him with extraordinary powers: strength, speed and a remarkable ability to scale buildings as if his hands and feet had tape bonded to them. After Uncle Ben is killed in an accidental shooting, Peter begins to use these abilities, along with a formula for advanced webbing his father developed, to search out the criminal responsible for Ben's death. Peter begins to expand his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a classmate who is also an intern at Oscorp. He also begins to wonder about Dr. Connors, who is acting strangely and, when faced with the shutdown of his research, injects himself with the genetic formula, transforming himself into a creature that becomes known as the Lizard, and this experience sends him on a path to madness that Peter must try to stop.The biggest weaknesses of The Amazing Spider-Man are, unsurprisingly, the revisiting of the same material that was brought to life 10 years ago. Most audience members are familiar with the spider bite, the moments of Peter discovering his powers, and his hunt for Ben's killer. It also doesn't help that in the years since the release of the first Spider-Man, countless other super hero film adaptations have seen the light of day and mined similar material. At this juncture, the origin story plot has really started to show both its age and its overexposure. That being said, The Amazing Spider-Man does approach most of these moments in a different vein than the prior entry. A key difference is to focus on Peter's budding relationship with Gwen Stacy, Peter's first girlfriend in the comics but a character that was relegated to cameo status in Spider-Man 3. Garfield and Stone bring a degree of chemistry and involvement to the relationship and this element of the film feels stronger than the Peter/Mary Jane pairing in the earlier films.Garfield also proves a capable lead in the role of Peter. While Tobey Maguire largely focused on portraying Peter as a somewhat shy nerd, for lack of a better term, Garfield's performance enhances Peter's nervousness and captures the awkwardness of the teenage years, stammering in his dialogue at times and giving Peter a degree of uncertainty in his moments with Gwen. It isn't necessarily better than Maguire's turn, but it is sufficiently different to not feel like a rehash. Stone proves a bit more fetching and strong willed than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, and her realization of Gwen is certainly the stronger female presence when compared to Dunst.The Amazing Spider-Man also excels on the technical front. The visual effects that bring the action sequences to life are impressive, to say the least, and the film benefits from the decade of development in technology since the first Spider-Man. The moments in which Spider-Man soars through the city and faces off against the Lizard are eye-opening, and prove viscerally involving. James Horner's music score is also a standout, providing a fairly traditional symphonic score in a day and age where so many films are moving towards a sound design influenced musical environment.There is no denying that The Amazing Spider-Man arrives with quite a bit of baggage attached, and it isn't completely successful at slaying all of the downfalls of revisiting this material, but for the most part, this entry works, and proves, like 1998's The Incredible Hulk, that there is more than one decent modern interpretation of a traditional comic book hero.",7,3,5,23 December 2012
Now You See Me," Caper film that is a little too dependent on surprises
","Now You See Me is a film that is all about obfuscation. Focusing on four magicians that perform feats of wonder first separately and later together, from the first frame on, the film engages in cinematic sleight of hand. However, that formula backfires on the film: by constantly trying to engage in trickery, the audience finds itself always on the lookout for it, and by the time it starts winding down, most of the potential surprises are rendered moot by the fact that we were looking for and expecting said surprises. Thus, while Now You See Me is fun and engaging at times, as a twist-filled surprise machine, it falls flat on it's face.As the film opens, we are introduced to four illusionists: fast talking street-level card sharp Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), 'mentalist' and small-time con man Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), spoon-bending junior magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and show-stopping high-thrills Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). All of them are given a special card with an address and time on it, and when they all show up at the prescribed time and place, a small apartment in New York, they discover what appears to be a quite elaborate set of plans. Flash forward one year later, and the four magicians are performing as a single act under the moniker The Four Horsemen and are being bankrolled by millionaire Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) During their debut performance in Las Vegas, they close their act with a rather spectacular accomplishment: they transport a French audience member to his bank in France and proceed to steal several billion dollars from it and magically transport it back to the Las Vegas auditorium where they pour it onto the audience.Unsurprisingly, this gets the attention of the FBI, and agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is assigned to the case. He teams up with Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent) and interrogates the Four Horsemen, but with nothing to pin on them, is forced to let them walk. Rhodes seeks the counsel of former magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who now spends his time debunking magicians, revealing what is 'behind the curtain'. With Bradley's help, Rhodes is able to unravel what happened at the first performance, but the Four Horsemen are already moving on to New Orleans for their next show and Rhodes and Dray are trying to stay one step ahead of them.Now You See Me is a film that is intended to keep us on our toes, to leave the audience guessing and wondering what the next revelation is going to be. Sometimes these kind of films can work well, engaging in misdirection and providing red herrings and dead ends for us to believe in before showing us what is really going on. Where Now You See Me missteps is that, from very early in the proceedings, the film telegraphs its intentions so loudly that most of the enjoyment of being caught up in twists is lost. That the twists are such a central part of the film is obvious from the start and makes them less engaging than if they evolved more naturally out of the narrative. Now You See Me is designed and built almost exclusively to keep us guessing but by focusing almost exclusively on that, it overreaches.Now You See Me isn't helped by the fact that the main characters are, save for some quickly introduced character moments and a few exchanges of witty dialogue, almost completely ciphers. Atlas, McKinnney, Wilder and Reeves are barely developed at all, and frankly, excepting for the moments they are performing their stage acts, are not even afforded that much screen time. The screenplay does play a bit with the intentions of the characters, but it is obvious that we are supposed to be rooting for them at times, and it makes it difficult to work up much enthusiasm for them when we barely know them. More screen time is afforded to Rhodes and Dray, and the two develop a romantic chemistry that is palpable at times, but, much like the other characters, they are largely pawns of the screenplay, but they are at least given more to work with than the magicians.Director Louis Leterrier films Now You See Me in Michael Bay mode: the camera rarely stops moving for more than a few seconds. During the magic acts, especially the first one in Vegas, this does bring a degree of style to the proceedings but at times the over reliance on an endlessly moving camera can prove distracting. However, Leterrier does keep the pace brisk and the energy level high. Now You See Me certainly can't be called boring.If Now You See Me succeeds anywhere, it is in the casting. Leterrier has pulled together a strong set of performers and, especially regarding the Four Horsemen, what is sometimes lacking in the screenplay is made up for by likable actors. Eisenberg makes Atlas a fast talking smart alec with a nice streak of charisma, Harrelson gives some fun wisecracks and Fisher is, once again, a strong sensual presence with a degree of toughness. Morgan Freeman can't help but class up anything he appears in and his turn here is no different, his Bradley is nice mix of arrogance and charm. Ruffalo is also at his dependable best, a man fighting to stay with his fugitives while barely managing to stay on top of their capers. It may sound like I am down on Now You See Me, but that isn't completely true. By the time the film was over, I found myself pleasantly engaged and entertained at times, but so much is wrapped up in the film's obvious Rube Goldberg plotting that you can't but help feel disappointed when the film doesn't really deviate from where you expect. Now You See Me is like sneaking a peek at your Christmas gifts: knowing what is coming isn't as much fun as not knowing.",6,13,27,31 May 2013
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Thunder a hilarious satire of Hollywood
","Ben Stiller is a pretty funny guy, in case you weren't aware of this. Whether working on his own short-lived sketch comedy series to starring in films for the Farrelly Brothers to directing and starring in his own theatrical productions, Stiller does not disappoint. So, it is no surprise that his most recent directorial turn, Tropic Thunder, is a pretty funny movie. A satire of Hollywood and war movies, Tropic Thunder delivers the laughs in spades and proves to be one of the funniest movies of 2008.Tropic Thunder features a film in production based on a true life story by 'Four Leaf' Tayback (Nick Nolte), the survivor of a major Vietnam war battle who lost his hands in the process. The film is being headlined by down-on-his-luck action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), method actor extrordinaire Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr) and drug-addled comedy star Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), each of which is proving intolerable to work with for director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). After being threatened to be shut down by a studio executive, Cockburn is given a bit of inspired advice from Tayback: take the actors into the jungle with just the director and shoot the film documentary style. There is one problem with this plan: the jungle they land in is controlled by drug growers who take some of the actors hostage, leaving the others to formulate a plan to save their comrades, while fighting their own lack of real world skills and prima donna attitudes.Tropic Thunder is a film that, for the most part, isn't afraid to skewer some major Hollywood troupes. The ridiculousness of some method actors, the sense of entitlement by major stars, the desire for directors to make a major 'statement', the willingness of agents to go to extremes for their clients and finally, the over-the-top, do my bidding attitude of 'mega' producers, Stiller and fellow screenwriters Justin Theroux and Etan Coen leaves few stones unturned in their search for things to satirize. Most of the jokes hit home, providing an abundance of laughs.The screenplay is helped in large measure by it's actors, especially Robert Downey, Jr, Jack Black and Tom Cruise. Downey, Jr's turn as Kirk Lazarus is absolutely hilarious, portraying a man who gets cosmetic procedures to darken his skin so that he can portray an African American member of the original military squad. Like behavior that is reported about many method actors, Lazarus refuses to break character at all, always acting as if he is an African American. The results are side- splitting at times, and Downey, Jr, experiencing a resurgence in his career, delivers a knock out performance. Black uses his usual manic energy to good effect as Portnoy, who finds himself trapped in the jungle with no drugs and quickly going through a rather tough withdrawal. But, the show is completely stolen by Tom Cruise as producer Les Grossman. Covered in makeup and a fat suit, Cruise brings the foul-mouthed, hip-hop dancing producer to life to great comic effect. While Cruise has a smaller part, when he is on the screen, you largely can't help but crack up laughing.Tropic Thunder is not for everybody: it is filled with a decent amount of violence and gore, and is laced top to bottom with vulgar language, so if you are easily offended, Tropic Thunder is not going to be for you. But if you appreciate a smart satire of modern Hollywood, you don't have to look any further than Tropic Thunder.",8,1,3,27 November 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Visually striking and fun to boot
","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a stylistic smorgasbord that draws inspiration from a few key genres and pop culture elements, most specifically video games and music. I have heard it described in one corner as parody, but that I would say is incorrect. It is more a love letter to its influences, albeit with a comic bent, for certain. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is an entertaining film that will play well to a certain segment of the population, and, unfortunately, at the box office it seemed that segment was smaller than many wished.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is based off a series of comics written by Brian Lee O'Malley. I am unfamiliar with the source material, so I can't comment on the faithfulness to them. The centerpiece is young Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), who is playing in a band named Sex Bob-Omb and has recently started dating a younger girl named Knives Chou (Ellen Wong). Into Scott's life falls Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a girl with constantly shifting hair color (she claims it changes every week and half) who Scott encounters in dreams before she turns out to be very corporeal and not just a figment of Scott's imagining. Scott, smitten, begins a relationship with her, but quickly finds that Ramona has some significant baggage: a group of 7 evil exes (don't just say ex- boyfriends, by the way) who have joined forces to fight against Scott in an attempt to reclaim Ramona for themselves. Scott, while not enamored of the concept, does his best to step up to plate as he wants to keep Ramona to himself.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World lives in a very fantasy reality that closely resembles our own. At first, it just looks like an everyday city with drama that most of us can relate to. It doesn't take long before we realize that things are not exactly as they are in our world. Dreams turn into reality, and then evil exes swoop out of the sky and challenge Scott to a duel, involving lots of martial arts fighting, flying, and comic book style expressions of action (the words POW and BANG float into view when someone fights or something crashes, for instance) and as Scott faces off with his opponents, a visual score tally appears, complete with video game sounds. So, if realism is what you seek, then it would be best to pass on Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. If, however, you enjoy video games and comic books, then Scott Pilgrim might be your speed.Director and co-writer Edgar Wright, who previously brought us Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, keeps his tongue firmly in his cheek with Scott Pilgrim. It is obviously not designed to take seriously, but it also wouldn't be fair to classify it an out and out comedy. It has its share of laughs, to be sure, but also is awash in visually striking, well choreographed fight sequences that rival such films as The Matrix in their energy and style. Its look is also heavily stylized, filled with obvious references to comic books without going to same degree as Ang Lee did with his take on the Hulk, which featured panels around the scenes in many cases.What makes Scott Pilgrim even more rewarding is that, for the most part, we identify and are taken in with its lead characters. Scott is a basically nice guy who seems a bit on the nerdy side, yet isn't without his flaws. Ramona seems a bit more jaded by life, and meeting Scott thaws her a bit from her rather troubled life up to this point. The dialogue between the two is lively and Cera and Winstead have an easy chemistry that works well.Wright has managed to fill many of the supporting roles, especially some of the evil exes, with names that are not superstars, but recognizable players that all offer up amusing turns in their various roles. Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and Jason Schwartzman all are having fun with their roles, and there is also a degree of satire in each character in regards to their chosen career and lifestyle (actor, vegan musician, and indie rock promoter).Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is an entertaining film that didn't find its audience in the theater, but on video, it would not surprise me, especially considering who the film is targeted at, that it would eventually develop a cult following. Again, while I don't think Scott Pilgrim is everyone's cup of tea, if you have an affinity for what Scott Pilgrim draws from, and an ability to suspend disbelief, then I would say it is more than worth a look.",8,0,3,12 March 2011
Quantum of Solace," A Quantum drop in quality
","Following the successful 'reboot' of the James Bond franchise with 2006's Casino Royale, Daniel Craig has returned to the role of Bond with the follow-up, Quantum of Solace. For everyone salivating over a second entry of the new, stripped down Bond film series, Quantum of Solace may prove to be a bit of a letdown. While hardly a poor entry in the Bond oeuvre, it is a significant step down from Casino Royale, with a bit too much emphasis on action and not enough on character.Picking up almost immediately from where Casino Royale left off, Bond has captured Mr. White (Jesper Christiansen) and brought him in for questioning by Bond's superior, M (Judi Dench, once again). What Bond and M quickly discover is that the organization that White works for, known as Quantum, has far ranging influence and are using their powers to topple governments in order to gain a foothold wherever they deem financial lucrative for them.Bond follows clues that lead him to Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a key player in Quantum, who is helping to destabilize the government of Boliva in order to install a dictator, General Medrano (Joaquin Cosio), to allow them to control a valuable natural resource. Accompanying Bond on his mission is Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who has a personal score to settle with Medrano, while Bond is also set on revenge for the death of his love from Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd.Quantum of Solace, much like Casino Royale, has thrown many James Bond staples to the wind: gone is the utterance of 'Bond, James Bond', absent are the goofy gadgets, and Bond's sex drive has been ratcheted down significantly (he beds a mere single woman in the film). This is a Bond film more in the mold of the recent Bourne series, not taking a lot of down time from action to let the narrative breathe. This proves to be unfortunate, as one of the things that distinguished Casino Royale was the depth it devoted to character development over just action sequences. Quantum of Solace is almost wall to wall action sequences, with a snippet of dialogue here and there, and only lip service paid to Bond's search for vengeance for the death of Vesper.One of the film's other key flaws is the over-edited action sequences. Director Marc Forster and editors Matt Chesse and Richard Pearson have taken a page from the Michael Bay book of film-making and made sure to keep the cuts fast and furious, reducing some of the action sequences to barely decipherable collages of random objects in motion. If action is your main focus, at least make it coherent.Daniel Craig proves once again to be a good choice for the role, with plenty of physical appeal and a nice sense of confidence in the role. Mathieu Amalric is something of a mixed bag as villain Dominic Greene, not up to par with many of the more flamboyant Bond villains, but still menacing and creepy at times. Olga Kurylenko is attractive and has a bit more substance to her than many Bond girls, proving to be a bit more of a sidekick than love interest.Overall, Quantum of Solace is something of a minor disappointment, coming on the heels of the very strong Casino Royale. But compared with many of the outlandish entries in the years of Roger Moore, it would be difficult to identify it as a poor entry in the franchise. We can only hope that the next entry rides a little closer to Casino Royale's high mark.",7,0,0,3 December 2008
Batman Begins," I like how this 'Begins'
","With the exception of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, no other comic book film franchise has gone into hibernation with as weak a final entry as the Batman series. 1997's Batman & Robin, filled with camp, bad one-liners, an overstuffed cast and just general corniness seemed to have felled the Caped Crusader semi-permanently. Eight years later, director Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer have breathed new life into Batman with Batman Begins, the best entry in the Batman series yet and one of the best comic book adaptations to date.Jettisoning all the baggage of the previous Batman films, Nolan and Goyer have started fresh, electing to focus on Batman's origin. They succeed brilliantly in placing the film's focus on the title character for the first time, and also follow in suit of X-Men by treating the material as seriously as possible.As Batman Begins opens, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), a millionaire heir to his late father's fortune, is traveling the world, attempting to learn as much about the criminal element as possible by acting as a criminal. He is approached by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a lieutenant of Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), the leader of the League of Shadows, an organization dedicated to eradicating crime in the world. While training with the League, we are treated to flashbacks of Bruce as a child, living near crime infested Gotham City, discovering a large cave under his family's elaborate mansion, Wayne Manor, and being attacked by bats, which Bruce quickly develops a fear of. Shortly thereafter, Bruce's father and mother are killed in a mugging and Bruce is raised by his faithful butler, Alfred (Michael Caine). Robbed of an opportunity to shoot his parent's killer, and intimidated by the local crime boss, Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), Bruce begins his trek. Upon completion of his training with the League, he discovers that they are a little more ruthless than he realized and splits with them, returning to his home city of Gotham to fight crime his own way. With the assistance of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman),the head of the special research division of his father's company, Wayne Enterprises, Bruce discovers some advanced technology that he fashions into a suit that he wears to combat crime in the guise of his greatest fear, bats. As Bruce unveils his crime-fighting persona, Batman, Gotham City is being threatened by a hallucinogenic drug being imported to the city by psychiatrist Johnathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), also known as the Scarecrow. Assisted by honest Gotham detective James Gordan (Gary Oldman) and his childhood sweetheart, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), Batman determines he must unravel the plot the Scarecrow is weaving before it destroys Gotham.Since the release of the first Batman movie in 1989, one character in the franchise has remained a mystery on the big screen: Bruce Wayne himself. The prior films always focused on the outrageous villains and elaborate production design, relegating Batman to the background. Here, he is center stage. Batman Begins is very much a character study of Bruce Wayne, as learns to take all the fear, hatred and guilt that he has pent up since he saw his parents die and transform himself into a force of justice to combat the crime that is engulfing Gotham City. He struggles with his guilt, leaving everything he knows behind to immerse himself in criminal culture to eventually learn why the criminal ticks. However, despite his desire to see criminals brought to justice, he still maintains a sense of mercy that prevents him from going too far.Another strong point is the creation of a recognizable reality. Sure, a world where a man dresses in a suit designed to look like a bat is not what I would call realistic, but Batman Begins comes as close as possible. Gotham City is based off of real-world Chicago, and passes for a real, living, breathing city. There are plausible explanations created for Batman's hardware and equipment. Nolan and production designer Nathan Crowley's realistic approach lends a greater weight to the story.The villains and their plot also have a strong connection to the character development of Bruce Wayne, not just some random goal that sounds as if it was concocted by a screenwriter just so there could be some excuse for the film to exist. While some of the details of the overall scheme are a bit shaky, the overall plot is integral to the film, not just an afterthought. Also, Batman is depicted working at solving a mystery, not just reacting to the events going on around him. He is something of a detective here, unlike before where he seemed to be a bit player.However, the film has weaknesses. While I enjoyed the focus on the character of Bruce Wayne, the villains are somewhat underutilized, at times seeming almost inconsequential. Unlike Spider-Man 2, where Doctor Octopus was a fully-realized, three-dimensional character on par with Peter Parker, here the villains for the most part service the plot and little else. Cillian Murphy is very effective as the Scarecrow, no doubt, but doesn't quite stake out a claim to fame in the comic villains hall of fame. The character of Rachael Dawes is also a weak link in the chain, proving to be a generic love interest and little else. Katie Holmes does her best, but the chemistry between her and Nolan is nonexistent.Christian Bale gives the strongest performance yet for the character of Bruce Wayne. He brings intensity and drive to the character, and fills out the various aspects of Bruce Wayne. Instead of just serving as a placeholder, Bale gives Bruce Wayne presence. The rest of the supporting cast, especially Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, perform admirably, giving Batman Begins a memorable cast overall.For those who could not believe that a franchise as hobbled as Batman could be rescued, Batman Begins is good evidence that anything can be saved with the right approach.",9,2,3,22 July 2005
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Surprisingly strong fourth entry
","After Tom Cruise had a falling out with Paramount following his controversial behavior in mid 2000s from his ranting about psychiatrists and promotion of Scientology, it seemed somewhat unlikely that another Mission: Impossible film would be in the offing starring him. But in Hollywood, time heals all wounds, at least where there is money to be made. So, several years later, here is the fourth entry in the Mission: Impossible film franchise, subtitled Ghost Protocol. And, most interestingly, it is one of the better entries in the series, featuring some strong action set pieces that keep the audience on the edge of their seat at several key points in the proceedings.Ghost Protocol finds Ethan Hunt (Cruise) in prison in Russia at the opening under mysterious circumstances. Sprung by IMF agents in a sequence that brings to mind the opening of a James Bond film, we quickly learn that Ethan is needed to help locate and stop a former Russian politician named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) who believes that the only way to achieve global peace is to start a nuclear war and let the survivors sort out the mess. Joined by Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and a somewhat unwilling analyst named Brandt (Jeremy Renner) who has been forced by circumstances to work with the team, Ethan finds that, after the Kremlin is bombed, that the President has 'disavowed' the entire IMF by declaring Ghost Protocol, and they must work outside of official sanction to stop Hendricks from detonating a nuclear weapon with stolen launch codes. The trail for him takes them from Russia to Dubai and finally Mumbai as they race against the clock.At first glance, you might find yourself wondering how three of the four Mission: Impossible films finds the team outside of their support system and being treated as terrorists; haven't the writers seen the other films and don't they get a little beat of wandering down the same road so many times. But, frankly, as with the ever ongoing Bond films, Mission: Impossible is less about plot and more about its action sequences, and this time the film has delivered in spades. Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol features the live-action debut of animation director Brad Bird, who helmed Pixar's hit The Incredibles, and he does a good job of assembling strong, involving set pieces that keep the audience on the edge of its seat. The standout is the middle portion, set in Dubai, where script contrivances lead Ethan to need to scale the exterior of Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. Bird stages these scenes stunningly, really ramping up the vertigo and tension as Hunt uses glue-like gloves to climb the side of the glass windowed tower. Other set pieces in Russia and Mumbai also have zip to them, keeping the suspense solid throughout.If Ghost Protocol has weaknesses, they are largely in the development of the villains. Hendricks and his henchman Wistrom (Samuli Edelmann) have the basic makings of some nice megalomaniacal villains, but suffer from limited screen time and some very limited depth. They serve the plot's basic need for villains, but don't really come across as the kind of visceral bad guys you love to hate. As much as the nuclear launch codes Ethan and team are chasing, they fill the standard Hitchcock position of the MacGuffin, and don't make a lasting impression on the audience.Back for his fourth turn as Ethan, Cruise is dependable as always, giving Hunt that reserved, slightly above it all attitude that keeps him largely cool under fire, but he does have his moments when the guard is lowered and you can see him concerned about the stakes they are fighting for. Paula Patton is attractive in the role of Jane, who the script gives some more personal drive in the search for Hendricks and his cronies, Pegg delivers some welcome comic relief in the role of Benji and Renner, who has been rumored to be groomed for future Mission: Impossible films if Cruise steps down, holds his own in the action sequences, as well as providing the audience with a semi-outsider to empathize with as the circumstances consistently get higher and higher for the characters past what he is used to dealing with in his role as an analyst thrown into the action.For the most part, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol delivers a strong, fast, popcorn munching action film that provides thrills without turning into an over-edited explosion fest that you often get from a film directed by Michael Bay. If this is what the Mission: Impossible franchise can deliver on its fourth outing, then it may have plenty of entries for years to come.",7,7,11,29 January 2012
Cars," Cars is worth racing
","In the computer animated movie race, Pixar Animation Studios is the clear front runner, so it is fitting that their newest opus, Cars, is a film about a race car. Cars is an entertaining and enjoyable romp, for certain, although it is a little slower and more steeped in nostalgia than their previous films, and as such, children may find it a little less exciting than talking toys and monsters hiding under the bed.Cars opens at a major race where Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) ties for the Piston Cup, a major racing trophy. A run-off race is scheduled in California one week later, and so McQueen sets out for the race, and his plan is to win the cup and land the major sponsor, Dinoco. Partway through the trip, McQueen gets lost on Route 66 and ends up under arrest in the small town of Radiator Springs. McQueen is ordered to repair the road of the small sleepy hamlet, and along the way becomes familiar with the local color: hick tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), motel owner Porsche Sally (Bonnie Hunt), custom paint car Ramone (Cheech Marin), Ferrari enthusiast Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and the local tune up expert, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).Lightning just wants to finish the road and get to the race, but he shortly begins to realize that what there is in Radiator Springs is what is missing from his life: friends. He begins a friendship with Mater and finds himself falling for Sally. When he later learns that Doc is a famous former race car, he starts asking him for information about his past and Doc is convinced to get this loner out of the city before he causes damage to the people he loves around him.Cars isn't built around the most original of concepts, the hotshot youngster who discovers that there is more to life than winning and himself. But in true Pixar style, they can still take it and make a good, solid two hours of entertainment out of it. As with most prior Pixar hits, Cars is helped by a few key elements: snappy dialogue, good voice acting and some spectacular looking imagery.Ever since their first hit with Toy Story, Pixar has always managed great sounding dialogue along with smart, funny characters and Cars is no different. Mater is given most of the really memorable bits, but everyone in the film has some great moments throughout. While many of the characters are not exactly original, they are drawn sharply enough to be memorable. The characters are helped along by strong voice casting. Owen Wilson fits the young, brash McQueen perfectly, Paul Newman is equally strong as the grizzled old veteran Doc. Larry the Cable Guy will, without doubt, be the biggest hit with children as Mater. Most the supporting cast, including Bonnie Hunt, Cheech Marin and George Carlin as a hippie Volkswagen bus, are fitting for their parts.Where Cars goes over the top is in it's imagery. This is easily Pixar's most gorgeous looking film to date, with spectacular vistas of the great American heartland that is breathtaking. The animators and art directors are not without a sense of humor, as they have designed many of the rock mesas and mountains in many of the scenic shots looking like old '50s era vehicles. The texture work on the cars is impressive also, the paint jobs and metallic surfaces as real as they should be. It all has a strong sense of stylization, but that works in the film's favor.Cars may fall a little short in one key area: keeping youngsters preoccupied. Cars moves at a slower pace and features elements of reverence for times gone by that many children may not be thrilled by. Most adults should find Cars more than diverting, and it's nice to see an animated film that is willing to slow up and take the time to catch it's breath, but the younger set may be quickly find their attention wandering. Even so, Cars should once again prove a winner for Pixar and leave the audience waiting for their next hit.",8,0,0,13 June 2006
Ghost Rider," Hardly a 'Ghost' of a chance for quality
","So, let's be honest right up front: Ghost Rider has a somewhat silly premise. Sort of a modern-day homage to Faust, it involves motorcycle stunt rider extraordinaire Johnny Blaze selling his soul to the devil to save his father from cancer, only to have the devil pull a fast one on him (that sneaky devil). The deal Johnny agreed to transforms him into Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty-hunter, who goes two-wheelin' on a motorcycle with flaming tires, complete with flaming skull of his own for a head, whenever he is in the 'presence of evil'. So, yeah, whatever you want to say about men crawling up buildings or people who can heal themselves, Ghost Rider has it beat. So, it's perhaps fitting, although unfortunately so, that Ghost Rider the movie is a somewhat silly affair as well. Hardly bottom-of the-barrel film-making, Ghost Rider can't help but come up a little short of the mark that would allow it to be classified as good.As with any 'origin story' comic book film, there is some backstory to Ghost Rider, involving a host of contracts the devil made in a town in the old west named San Venganza. The devil's son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has decided to take a vacation from Hell to obtain this contract and use it to conquer Hell, or Earth, or something (the film is a little vague on this point), because this particular contract made these souls apparently a special kind of evil. Well, the devil, known by his traveling name of Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), isn't quite ready to let sonny boy dethrone him, so he calls in Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) aka Ghost Rider to stop Blackheart and his minions. Johnny is a somewhat reluctant hellish bounty hunter, however, as he is trying to reconnect with former teenage love Roxanne (Eva Mendes) who is now a television news reporter, and find a way to get a second chance after his mistake of taking the devil's deal.Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson, who last brought Marvel superhero Daredevil to the screen, appropriately realizes that this material doesn't exactly lend itself to a straight faced approach, so Ghost Rider has it's tongue firmly implanted in its cheek. Many scenes involve characters explaining some of the plot to others and appearing to hardly believe it themselves. Bystanders in the film have the appropriate slack-jawed reaction to a guy on a motorcycle with a flaming skull for a head that you could imagine yourself wearing if you were in their same position. However, Johnson makes the mistake of not stopping short of letting the film become borderline camp. In one scene, Ghost Rider gives the middle finger salute, tells cops they are 'Pissing him off' in another, and features a ridiculous scene in which Johnny, during an interrogation, tells two cops how much he respects their profession and has plans to be a police officer himself once his stunt-riding days are over. There is a degree of self-referential humor that works for this material, but then Ghost Rider just keeps going past the point of light humor into near parody.Ghost Rider also manages to be fairly lame action movie when the fights between Ghost Rider and Blackheart's henchmen kick in. Those scenes are relatively rote, lacking any excitement and energy, and most of the scenes involving Johnny riding a motorcycle are without any visceral thrill as well. There is also the practically unnecessary love story between Johnny and Roxanne that lacks any chemistry. Why do comic book movies always think they need a romance subplot? The cynical side of me knows it's to provide something of interest to the girlfriends who get dragged to this movie by their significant others, but if the filmmakers are just going to phone it in, they should leave it out. Yeah, he's supposed to be a tragic hero saved by love, but in this case, you don't believe these two are really in love.Ghost Rider's silliness isn't helped by Nicholas Cage's performance. Cage knows he is working with material that is pretty ridiculous and takes his performance a bit too far over the top. His performance falls into the 'quirky' category, and while amusing at times, doesn't help save Ghost Rider from being interpreted as a joke. Eva Mendes is just, well, there, as Roxanne, not terrible, but hardly memorable or outstanding. Ghost Rider really comes up short in the villain department. Wes Bentley's Blackheart is a clichéd, one-dimensional villain who doesn't inspire much fear or distaste from the audience. His minions are both silly and non-threatening and may be cause for a few snickers. The only saving grace here is Peter Fonda as the devil. He's not around much, but he is effective.Ghost Rider would be sunk without decent visual effects, and on this front, the film is reasonably successful. The flaming skull effects are believable (well, as believable as flaming skulls get), and most of the bike-riding while on flames scenes hold up well also. The music score, by horror specialist Christopher Young, also is strong, being something of a fusion of Gothic orchestra, western and hard rock. Unfortunately, these elements can't completely save a screenplay that is wallowing in tired dialogue such as 'You will pay for this!' or 'Mephistopheles, I knew you would come!' For $110 million, you would hope that would buy something a little deeper than a guy who just looks really cool with his head on fire.",6,29,55,29 May 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," 'Stand' up for this strong sequel
","X-Men: The Last Stand is a fitting conclusion to the X-Men trilogy of films (although it has yet to be seen whether or not it will expand beyond these three pictures). Even with a directorial change, Brett Ratner subbing in for Bryan Singer, who left to direct Superman Returns, X-Men: The Last Stand is, for the most part, on par with the first two X-Men films, which is both a blessing and a curse. While it is technically well-made, entertaining and engaging, once again, there are too many characters, too many plot lines and not enough screen time to make everything satisfying.Picking up some time after X2, The Last Stand finds things looking up for mutants in the USA: a new President (Josef Summer) has appointed Dr. Hank McCoy aka Beast (Kelsey Grammar) as the Secretary of Mutant Relations and is trying to track down rogue mutant Magneto (Ian McKellan). Meanwhile, all is not well back at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. Cyclops (James Marsters) is unable to cope with the loss of his wife, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) at the end of X2. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) are attempting to train the younger generation of X-Men, but disagreeing over approach. Into this setting comes the revelation that a 'cure' has been developed that will suppress the mutant gene in current mutants, allowing them to live as standard humans. Magneto and his followers don't agree with this philosophy at all, and are prepared to do whatever it takes to stop the cure from being distributed.Meanwhile, Jean has been discovered alive and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) reveals that her abilities are so powerful and without limits that he had been forced to suppress a split personality in Jean earlier in life that has now remanifested under the name the Phoenix. When the Phoenix takes control of Jean, she decides to join Magneto's cause and the X-Men must find themselves fighting one of their own, along with Magneto's rather extensive army of mutants.X-Men: The Last Stand is more than up to the task of delivering an action-packed, attractive looking movie. Director Ratner keeps the action moving at brisk pace, the film rarely stopping to catch it's breath (although not completely without it's small moments). The action sequences are well-staged and on par with the first two X-Men films. Where The Last Stand fails to improve on it's predecessors is in it's handling of it's characters. There are just too many X-Men on screen to allow the audience to build much of an attachment or understanding of any of them very well. The majority of screen time is divided between Wolverine, Storm and Magneto, and they are served well enough, but most of the other characters, even such integral ones as Cyclops, Professor X, Jean Grey and Rogue are left feeling underused. Several new mutant characters are introduced in this film, but they are mostly pretty window dressing to the film. Almost no one really grabs you in this film, so when the big moments hit, you are left feeling somewhat under-involved.The film also has an extensive amount of plot, and while nothing is really mis-handled, it feels like a bit too much for one film to hold. There are some good ideas on display in The Last Stand, and credit must be given to screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg who manage to keep The Last Stand with it's feet firmly planted in a mostly believable world that bears a strong resemblance to our own. Comic book adaptations that work best, such as all the X-Men films, Superman and Batman Begins, aren't afraid to treat their source material with respect and appropriate seriousness, and The Last Stand is no different. Another strength the film displays is it's willingness to take chances with a franchise property that has performed well for it's home studio. Where other sequels are sometimes unwilling to really push the envelope, X-Men: The Last Stand is, and many of the film's stronger moments evolve from this decision.On the eye-candy front, X-Men: The Last Stand doesn't fail to impress. There are several set-pieces on display here, and they are all fairly strong. This isn't quite as attention-grabbing as a Star Wars movie, but when the big moments come, they have their appropriate force. Acting-wise, everybody is up to form, and none of the leads disappoint. Especially strong in this installment are Ian McKellan and Famke Janssen, and Kelsey Grammar is a welcome addition to the cast as Beast. Vinnie Jones is also notable for some nice one liners as villainous mutant Juggernaut, and Hugh Jackman proves once again that he was the perfect choice to play hard-case loner Wolverine.All in all, X-Men: The Last Stand is just as entertaining as X-Men and X2, with no real drop in quality apparent. Whatever weaknesses it possesses are ones that have been ingrained since the first film, so the filmmakers of The Last Stand are merely following suit. As far as summer blockbusters go, X-Men: The Last Stand is a cut above and worth your time, especially if you liked the first two.",7,0,1,28 May 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not a significant Rise of quality
","First things first: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is better than its predecessor, 2005's Fantastic Four. However, that doesn't mean it's a great film. Rise of the Silver Surfer has more interest and mystery to it, indeed, but it still falls short of comic book adaptation greatness by a long shot. An over-reliance on sitcom style humor, a lack of satisfying action, and a weak villain don't serve the film well, making Rise of the Silver Surfer an underwhelming experience.As the film opens, Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are about to be married when strange occurrences across the globe are brought to the attention of the Fantastic Four. Water is frozen over when it isn't winter, it snows in the desert, and large craters begin appearing throughout the world. Reed tracks the radiation present at the events and eventually narrows it to a being that is flying throughout the world, composed of silver and riding a surf-board like object. He is dubbed the Silver Surfer, and after having been chased by the Human Torch ne Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), the Surfer is discovered to be more powerful than bargained for.Also interested in the Silver Surfer is a healed Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who has reappeared and offers to help for hidden nefarious purposes. The Fantastic Four and Doom join forces to attempt to thwart the Surfer and stop the destruction throughout the planet, but the Surfer appears to only be a taste of the danger that looms on the horizon.The story of the Silver Surfer is one of the iconic comic book plot lines, cherished by millions, and while Rise of the Silver Surfer does a better job of producing a somewhat entertaining film than Fantastic Four, this probably isn't what comic book fans are looking for. The film's principal problem is it's rather shallow, silly humor that gets in the way of the story having much in the way of any impact. The Fantastic Four aren't really developed much, and fail to resonate with the audience, so their petty squabbling proves tiresome and counterproductive to building any interest in the goings on that occur. When one key emotional scene arrives, you don't feel anything for the characters because you just don't care about them.Rise of the Silver Surfer is hampered by the return of its weak villain, Victor Von Doom, in the guise of Julian McMahon. While he has a bit more menace this time around, he is still not tremendously threatening or interesting, and has relatively limited screen time. Screenwriters Don Payne and Mark Frost also make the poor decision to create one of the stupidest characters in a film in recent memory, Army General Hager, portrayed by Andre Braugher. This character is so inept and silly that you can't help but shake your head in several scenes. Braugher, a terrific actor, deserves much better.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer does do some things right though. The visual effects that realize the Silver Surfer are exceptional, proving to be fairly eye-popping at times. And while the Silver Surfer isn't given much of any development, he does have a sense of mystery and threat to him that works at times, and in a key scene manages to earn a degree of pathos.That being said, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer proves to be just a slight notch above what came before, and not the home run many in the comic book community might have been hopelessly dreaming of (this reviewer included). It isn't a disaster, Superman IV and Return of Swamp Thing don't have to worry about being dethroned as the worst comic book movies ever, but it could have been much more.",6,2,5,17 July 2007
Transformers," Not more than meets the eye
","I was an unabashed fan of the Transformers in my youth during the 1980s. It competed with two other major toy franchises (G.I. Joe and Masters of the Universe) for my attention and my parent's money, especially at Christmas time. I watched the animated series, went to see the animated movie twice in the theater in the summer of '86 and read the comic books. Of course, as time passed, other things consumed my interest over the Transformers, but I still feel a strong pull of nostalgia for that franchise. Now, two decades after the peak of the Transformers phenomenon, director Michael Bay has brought the Transformers back to the big screen with a live-action adaptation of the material, and as much as my nostalgia is piqued by this film, upon watching the final product, instead of mining gold, Bay, along with screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have managed to only produce a ho-hum affair, living up to the Shakespeare line: Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.Transformers opens in Iraq, where a helicopter lands at a military base and proceeds to lay waste to it, transforming into a giant robot, and attempting to hack the computers. The narrative then moves to America, where high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is purchasing his first car, which turns out to be a Camaro that is eerily insistent that Sam buy it. Upon getting it home, it drives itself off and Sam chases it, meeting up with a classmate, Mikaela (Megan Fox), and they find themselves caught in the middle of an interstellar war between two groups of sentient robots from another planet, the good ones named Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) , the evil ones Decepticons, led by Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving), who have the ability of camouflaging themselves as vehicles and electronic equipment. Both factions are in search of a cube named the All Spark that can bring life to otherwise inanimate technological objects; the Autobots want to destroy it before the Decepticons can use it to build an army to conquer the Universe (yes, a character actually specifies Universe in one scene).Transformers has a number of problems, but it's two principal ones are a padded running length and a lack of any genuine excitement. Much like the Pirates of the Caribbean films, Transformers is too long for the material it has to work with. After the opening battle scene in Iraq, the film runs a good hour plus before anything else of tremendous interest occurs. Most of the scenes in the middle feature Sam getting his car, hitting on Mikaela, and a subplot involving young analysts at the Pentagon trying to decipher a signal detected during the Qatar attack that will hopefully lead to an answer as to what happened at the base. There is some light comedy sprinkled into these scenes, but nothing compelling that hasn't been done before and you find yourself wondering when the giant robots the trailers promised are going to show up.Finally, the Transformers make an appearance, at which point the film showcases its most significant asset, the rather impressive computer animation of the Transformers. While the quality does vacillate a bit (many of the close-ups of the Transformers look fairly obviously computer generated), the majority of the imagery is well integrated into the real material for a reasonably seamless result. The problem, however, is that the Transformers are not developed at all as characters. Optimus Prime has a significant amount of dialogue, and Bumblebee, the Camaro, has some draw to him, but for the most part, they are just eye-candy. The Decepticons fare much worse, with no sense of menace, no danger to them, failing to cause us to hate them as villains. We don't care about the Transformers or their plight and aside from the fact that I played with them as a child, and therefore recognize the names, you can barely tell one apart from the other in most scenes.The culmination of all this is that none of the action sequences at the end of the film have any weight to them. There is pyrotechnics galore, to be sure, but none of it matters a bit. It is just scene after scene of explosions and generic, non-descript robots tussling with each other for no real purpose. We don't care if one wins or the other loses and we don't care about the majority of the human characters caught in the middle either (I couldn't give you the names of the characters portrayed by Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson from memory even if I tried). A few shots here and there have some kinetic kick to them, but that is about it.Shia LeBeouf carries the role of Sam fairly well and should prove to have a decent career ahead of him, but he can't manage to elevate the role above the generic part that has been created. Megan Fox is certainly very attractive, but her character has even less development than Sam and proves to just be one more visual attraction in a film swirling with pretty images. Jon Voight is mostly here to collect a paycheck, Anthony Anderson shows up for a few scenes to do a variation on his usual schtick (which is funny at times), and then there is John Turturro. Portraying a government agent, Turturro must have been told he was starring in a parody film and turns in an over the top performance that you can't even begin to take seriously. He is amusing, but it is just one more hit at giving any depth to this film.While some may disagree, I believe there is the possibility of a good film somewhere in this material, but Michael Bay was unable to recognize it and build one. Instead, we are left with this loud, overlong, underwhelming film that is definitely not more than meets the eye.",4,3,8,9 July 2007
Event Horizon," Effectively disturbing
","At first glance, Event Horizon would appear to be a science fiction film through and through. It's set in the future, features spacecraft and the men and women who fly them, and is about a rescue mission to another spacecraft. Yet, before long, it's quickly obvious that Event Horizon is, in fact, a horror film set in space, and a surprisingly effective one at that. While not a masterpiece, it is a reasonably disturbing film.Event Horizon opens in the mid 21st century, where man has attempted faster-than-light travel. The vessel built for this was the space ship the Event Horizon, and it contained at it's heart an artificial singularity, a miniature black hole if you will, that will open a door to another part of the universe. Upon first test of the engine, the ship disappeared, not to be heard from again. Seven years later, it reappears in orbit over Neptune and a rescue ship, the Lewis & Clark, is dispatched to determine if there are survivors, and what happened to the Event Horizon. Along for the ride is the ship's designer, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), whos going through a strong trauma in his life after his wife has recently committed suicide. The crew of the Lewis & Clark, commanded by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), listen to Weir's explanation of what happened to the Event Horizon and then receive a transmission from the ship that is garbled but seems to suggest a not so pleasant fate for the crew. The Lewis & Clark crew dock with the Event Horizon and begin investigating the ghost ship, but find strange happenings occurring throughout, with different members of the crew seeing strange things: Miller sees a man he left for dead on an exploding vessel, medical officer Peters (Kathleen Quinland) sees her crippled son, and the ships engineer, Justin (Jack Noseworthy) looked into the singularity engine and is put into a state of shock and Weir begins seeing visions of his wife.It quickly becomes apparent that the Event Horizon has been somewhere other than another part of the galaxy, and it has brought something back with it.Event Horizon is not a groundbreaking entry in the horror genre, that's for sure. Many aspects on display have been utilized in countless other films. And yet, director Paul Anderson manages to give us the requisite chills and leave us on the edge of our seats. A primary element that helps the film is the Event Horizon itself. Designed with a very Gothic look in mind, the ship just looks and feels scary. It is place I can't imagine anyone ever being comfortable being in. The dark, empty hallways and rooms are menacing themselves, and that helps ratchet up the tension. Anderson also does a good job of crafting suspenseful scenes involving the character's visions. Almost every one of those sequences will leave you unsure of what you will see and that keeps the audience in a state of unease.As the film progresses, there is an increase in make-up effects grusomeness, so I would agree that it makes it a difficult film to watch as it goes on. However, most everything in the last half-hour is payoff to the setup, so while it's not always pretty to watch, it makes it all the more effective.Acting wise, Event Horizon is decent, but nobody will be well remembered for their work. Sam Neill is probably the most memorable as the slowly disintegrating Weir, tumbling to madness before our eyes. Laurence Fishbure is effective as the hard-nosed captain, and everyone else gets the job done.A lot of people gave Event Horizon flack upon it's release, and again, it's not the most original horror film made, but it is one of the more disturbing I saw in the mid to late '90s, and I would give it a recommendation, just be careful watching it by yourself.",7,196,240,2 October 2004
Evil Dead," Remake that doesn't quite make the cut
","There are two things for certain regarding the 2013 remake of 1981's The Evil Dead. First, the film's advertising tagline 'The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience.' is, not surprisingly, a lie. Second, if you have no tolerance for blood, gore and accompanying viscera, then you would do well to avoid Evil Dead. That being said, Evil Dead is not a horror film to be trifled with, that's for sure, although while it has it's moments of unease and shock, the underlying sense of terror and suspense is largely missing. Evil Dead is designed as an endurance test, can you make it past the next major set piece without turning it off, and on that front Evil Dead certainly makes an impression.Five friends, Mia (Jane Levy), her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), Eric (Lou Pucci) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) are at David's family cabin in the woods to engage in an intervention for Mia who is a recovering heroin addict. In the basement of the cabin, the group discovers a book that is full of satanic imagery and Eric reads a passage from the book, resulting in demon spirits being unleashed. The spirits possess Mia and one by one the possession begins to spread to the others who then engage in attempts to dispatch the still human survivors in rather violent, gruesome ways. Trapped by a washed out bridge, the group must try to find a way to stop the onslaught from the possessed souls, even as their number dwindles.The original Evil Dead has earned a place in the popular zeitgeist, partially for introducing the character of Ash, portrayed by Bruce Campbell, to the general American audience, and for spawning a number of increasingly comedy oriented sequels. But, it's easy to forget that the first Evil Dead was largely a straightforward horror film, and a fairly scary one, in my opinion. There is certainly no trace of goofiness in the remake. It is a solid, no holds barred serious horror film, although there is a moment or two that does elicit a chuckle every now and then. Directed by first time filmmaker Fede Alvarez and co-written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, Evil Dead pulls no punches in it's attempts to shock. From copious vomiting, people being attacked by nail guns, crow bars, shards of mirror and various electrical power tools, Evil Dead is intent on pushing the envelope of violence, leaving no stone unturned in its search for gory scenes intended to test the audience's willingness to keep watching. However, the reliance on violence proves one of the film's downfalls. It is so wrapped up in assaulting us with its gore that it doesn't put enough effort into the other elements of what makes a good horror film, such as suspense. Evil Dead isn't without it's moments of making us feel uncomfortable or uncertain of what comes next, but those are fewer and far between than the gore. Evil Dead is trying to make us feel terrified, but it succeeds more often in just making us feel uncomfortable as limbs and other body parts are hacked off.This remake does not directly rehash characters from the original film and manages to provide a slightly different setup for the story. The character of Mia takes on an unusual position of serving as, at times, both protagonist and antagonist, being both the lead character and the first to be possessed by the demon's of the title. By introducing the plot thread that Mia is a recovering heroin addict going through withdrawal, the screenplay attempts to play with the idea that the things Mia sees at first are all in her head, but that is quickly dropped because you can only explain so much from the concept that she is going through a bad withdrawal, and speaking in demonic voices and causing your housemates to start slicing off their own flesh doesn't really fall into that category. Lead actress Jane Levy provides a good performance as Mia, both as the tortured former addict trying to get herself clean, and then as the chilling demonic version, taunting the others both physically and verbally. Shiloh Fernandez is solid as her brother, trying to make sense of the world that is rapid crashing around him as strange things keep happening. Lou Pucci gives a bit of comic relief and also serves as the film's token 'geek' who seems to be the only one understanding what is going on and coming up with answers on how to escape. The other two female roles are fairly underdeveloped and the characters fail to register much with us.Evil Dead missteps in it's last act, with an ending that fails to really provide any significant payoff to what has come before and that also seems to be something of a head scratcher in terms of the film's internal logic. Needless to say, being a remake of a horror film that launched a franchise, there is room left open for a sequel (look, its the Evil Dead, you can more or less count on them being available for another round, right). So, when all is said and done, is this Evil Dead remake successful? Yes and no. The filmmakers were certainly trying their best to take the series back to its horror roots, and if you are looking for a hard core gore fest, you can't do much better than this. Where Evil Dead falls a bit flat is in making the whole experience scary and affecting. It gives it a shot, but doesn't quite grasp the brass ring. You can do worse for remakes, but you can also do better.",6,1,9,28 July 2013
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Enjoy this tour of the 'Factory'
","Director Tim Burton has interest only in those you would consider outsiders. Normal people hold no appeal to him, so Burton is at his best when the film he makes focuses it's attention on those we would consider to be outside the norm. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, based on the novel by Roald Dahl, is a film right up Burton's alley, featuring the eccentric character of Willy Wonka and his amazing candy factory. Dahl's point of view, to attempt to teach morals featuring rather reprehensible 'normal' people, puts all his attention toward the oddities. I don't think Burton would want it any other way.For the few that don't know, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was previously adapted for the big screen by directory Mel Stuart in the early-1970s film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory that starred Gene Wilder in the title role. Willy Wonka has become recognized as a classic, famous among other things for it's funny morality songs belted out by the diminutive Oompa Loompas. Burton was not among the fans of the original film, which was reportedly not enjoyed by Dahl himself. Burton's take on the material is similar in many respects, but very different in others.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory focuses on Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), a poor boy who lives in a slightly off-kilter house with his mother (Helena Bonham-Carter), father (Noah Taylor) and two sets of grandparents. Soon, eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), has announced that he has placed five golden tickets in five random Wonka chocolate bars. He has kept his candy factory closed off to outsiders for years, and now will allow the five children who find the golden tickets in the candy to have access to his factory, along with one guardian each. Four of the five tickets are discovered by some rather unsavory characters: Augustus Gloop (Phillip Wiegratz), a fat overeater, Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb), a gum-chewing overachiever, Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), a spoiled brat, and Mike Teaveee (Jordan Fry), a genius who is infatuated with video games. Charlie makes the fifth, and is accompanied by his Grandpa Joe (David Kelley), who used to work at the factory. They are greeted by Willy Wonka at the entrance at the factory and are escorted throughout by Willy as they visit the various exotic sections of the factory and the surprises contained within.The center of the film is the performance of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. With a long velvet coat, white face, perfect teeth, and bob haircut, Depp creates a rather naïve but at the same time strangely twisted character. Wonka is a shut-in who has lost all contact and sense of the real world, who is repulsed by the children he has invited and cannot bring himself to say the word 'parents', because of his damaged relationship with his own father, a dentist who forbade him candy, portrayed by Christopher Lee. Unlike Wilder's interpretation which was a little more warm, Depp is off-putting and distant, but enormously fun to watch. Depp is nothing if not entertaining, and he makes Wonka his own.The majority of the film unfolds in Wonka's factory, which has been realized by production designer Alex McDowell as a rather unique environment, full of curves and elliptical environments, appearing very much as if designed in the 1960's. The factory is once again populated by the Oompa Loompas, here realized by a single performer, Deep Roy, replicated digitally to create an entire population of small workers. And, once again, the Oompa Loompas belt out a number of funny musical numbers, realized in a variety of styles and dance numbers that are very amusing. It's obvious that Dahl was trying to teach some values to children about selfishness and excess, and most of those sequences as each of the children are treated to their fate are appropriately over-the-top to get the point across but not so much that it turns the audience off. As with almost all of Burton's films, the production design and cinematography go hand in hand to create a visually arresting picture. The factory interiors, an Indian temple created out of chocolate, the Bucket household that is latterly listing to one side, all of it is rendered in Burton's usual unique style that is arresting to look at.If Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has one weakness, it is that once again, Burton has chosen to focus the attention on Wonka, and Charlie and his family feels a little short- changed by the script. They are not completely underused, but you don't quite feel to attachment to them that you should. Again, Burton's lack of interest in the 'normal' world comes back to haunt him.Aside from that minor complaint, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an entertaining and enjoyable romp that is worth checking out.",8,4,6,7 August 2005
Mission: Impossible II," Not quite as good a Mission
","It is difficult to think of a sequel that deviates from it's predecessor's style and format as much as Mission: Impossible II. The 1996 original was a reasonably faithful updating of the formula of the original 1960s television series, with some variations, as to be expected. Mission: Impossible II is a full-on action film, however, loaded with fights, car chases and some outrageously unbelievable moments. It is not necessarily unentertaining, but it is a bit of a drop from the first film.Mission: Impossible II opens in Sydney, Australia, where bio-technologist Dr. Nekhorvich (Rade Sherbedgia) has decided to smuggle a deadly virus out of the pharmaceutical company he works for and attempt to turn it and the antidote over to the U.S. government. On his way to America, he is murdered and the virus stolen by rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) who plans to sell it back to the company for millions. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is recruited to stop Ambrose from fulfilling his mission, and in doing so forms an alliance with an old lover of Ambrose, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), a thief who Hunt promptly falls in love with himself.Where Mission: Impossible was criticized for having an overly complicated plot, Mission: Impossible II is pretty much the exact opposite. The plot is straightforward and, frankly, relatively thin. Mission: Impossible II replaces complex plotting with over-the-top, high octane action. Directed by Hong Kong action supremo John Woo, Mission: Impossible II is definitely very much reflective of his individual style. Woo is responsible for balletic action operas in his native country, including such films as The Killer and Hard Boiled, which were distinctive for their almost non-stop action sequences that were assembled with extreme style. Woo's two prior American films, Hard Target and Broken Arrow, also are reflective of his style, although both lacked the kick of his Asian work. Mission: Impossible II is more of his traditional element, full of hand to hand combat, with extreme, borderline unbelievable results.In bringing his unique style to Mission: Impossible II, Woo film has refashioned the series from a cerebral suspense thriller to a modern day James Bond knock-off, with Hunt at center stage and all the supporting players kept at arm's length. Mission: Impossible II delivers on some impressive sequences, and they are by no means boring, but the absolute absurdity of it all quickly begins to wear out it's welcome. But it is fun at times, and Woo delivers some pretty pictures, full of many of his trademark elements (including plenty of doves in action sequences).On the character front, Mission: Impossible II is fairly bare bones. Thandie Newton is capable as thief turned secret agent Nyah, but her romance with Hunt is fairly uninvolving. There isn't a lot of chemistry or draw to the two of them, and at times their relationship seems like a plot necessity and not an integral component of the story. Dougray Scott does the appropriate amount of mustache twirling as despicable villain Ambrose, but he is occasionally over the top and manages to make his character into a bit of a caricature at times. Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickle, the only character to return from the first film other than Hunt, but he and fellow team member Billy Baird (John Polson) are given cameos at best. Cruise is once again capable, but hardly amazing as Ethan Hunt. He delivers what is necessary for the role, but nothing else.Mission: Impossible II could be viewed in the larger sense as another example of the dumbing down of American movies. The producers, reeling from complaints of Mission: Impossible's complexity and also possibly it's lack of action have delivered the exact antithesis with the sequel: a film which looks good, moves fast, and in which lots of stuff gets blowed up real good. But that is all there is, and while entertaining, you can't help but think something is missing at the core.",7,3,5,12 June 2006
The Hangover Part II," Here comes the new film, same as the old film
","There are a lot phrases you could apply to The Hangover, Part II. 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' comes to mind as to what was possibly at the forefront of director and co-writer Todd Phillips thoughts when he was assembling The Hangover, Part II, because if there is one thing you cannot accuse the sequel to the surprise comedy hit of 2009 of being, its original. The Hangover, Part II is a near complete rehash of the first entry, just with different locales and certain individual situations. That doesn't necessarily mean it isn't funny, but some of the sheen of the first film wears off the second time around.The Hangover, Part II finds buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galafinakis) in Thailand to attend Stu's pending nuptials 2 years after the events of the first film. Stu, not interested in being involved in a repeat of the events of Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party, has decided to eschew that traditional pre- wedding event for a simple drink on the beach with his friends and his bride to be's brother, Teddy (Mason Lee). The next morning, the trio find themselves passed out in a seedy Bangkok hotel with a trained monkey, a pounding hangover, a visitor in the form of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), the criminal gang leader from the first film, and Teddy nowhere to be found. In short order, Phil, Stu and Alan are prowling the streets of Thailand in search of Teddy via clues they pick up along the way as to the events from the prior evening. The search takes them to a tattoo parlor, a club in a significant state of disrepair, a strip club with 'interesting' employees and a Buhddist temple, with a threat hanging over their heads from a Thailand based crime boss (Paul Giamatti) to deliver some information for a bank transfer the next morning or they will never see Teddy again.While it is not unheard of for sequels to films that seemed like a one- shot to try to replicate what made the first film successful, I can rarely think of one that almost completely remakes the original like The Hangover, Part II. Every significant plot arc, story development and twist is lifted wholesale from the first film. If you are really familiar with the first film, I can't see where it wouldn't be impossible for you to guess almost every major event that is going to occur in The Hangover, Part II and end up being correct. We are treated to the characters reacting in very similar manners to the events in the same way as the first film: Stu with complete, sheer bewilderment, Phil with a constant air of disbelief how things can keep getting so bad, and Alan with a degree of detached amusement. The only real element that is a bit different this time is that they friends are in communication via cell phone with Doug, who had decided to turn in early the night they were drinking. It's a way for the creators to keep Bartha involved to some extent without interfering with the trio dynamic that worked for the first film, I suppose.So, the real question becomes, is the Hangover, Part II funny? Well, yes, it is. Despite the familiarity of the situation in the broad strokes, the individual segments prove to have some decent humor to them throughout. One scene in particular, set at the aforementioned strip club, left me roaring in laughter. Many of the other outrageous moments provide more than just a chuckle, and a chase sequence in the latter part of the film is about as engaging as one in any action movie. Some of the reason the two Hangover films work at all is that, despite the fact that two-thirds of the main trio are rather reprehensible people, you can't help but imagine what it would be like to be in that situation and therefore you have some degree of investment in seeing them attempt to navigate themselves out of this mire they have become trapped in.As mentioned previously, there isn't a lot different to these characters in general. Phil is the debaucherous friend who is seemingly in a search of a good time to shake off the normalcy in his life otherwise. Stu is a straight arrow who is put face to face with his 'dark side'. And Alan is a clueless social misfit whose idea of getting his friends to have a good time is to drug them with paralyzers and hallucinogens. The actors sell their roles fairly well, especially, once again, Galafinakis, and are supported by Jeong as the subtly homosexual Mr. Chow, who still doesn't seem to be afraid to bare himself (entirely) to the audience. Giamatti, while scenery chewing with the best, can graciously be referred to as giving a 'cameo' in the film considering his very limited screen time.The Hangover, Part II's unoriginality once again spills over to its 'moral message', what little there is of one, and it is once again exclusively directed at the character of Stu. In the first film, he was able to give a comeuppance to his fiancé in a rather amusing, albeit crowd pleasing way. In Part II, there is a similar dynamic with a different character, but this time the moments where Stu must come into his own don't really work, and seem cheesy and, frankly, a bit uncomfortable and unbelievable.So, when all is said and done, should you see The Hangover, Part II? I cannot deny that I laughed at it more often than not once it got going for the most part, but not to the degree I enjoyed the first film. However, it is also difficult to overlook the complete lack of originality on display in the film, so The Hangover, Part II proves a mixed bag, and one that receives a mild recommendation from me.",7,1,2,5 June 2011
Mission: Impossible," It's not Impossible to like this film
","With the trend that began in the early 1990's to adapt old television series into major motion pictures, Mission: Impossible was one of the many added to the list. Premiering in the late 1960's, Mission: Impossible was hit series for CBS for seven seasons and brought actors such as Peter Graves and Martin Landau to popular stardom. In 1996, superstar Tom Cruise collaborated with director Brian de Palma to bring the modern film version to life, and despite some critical drubbing at the time, Mission: Impossible proves to be one of the better television to motion picture adaptations to grace the screen to date.Mission: Impossible, the series, was very much in the same mold of the modern police procedural Law & Order: it was almost exclusively plot driven. Sure, the same characters reappeared episode after episode, but none of them were ever fleshed out or significantly developed. The series was exclusively interested in telling it's tale of a team of U.S. spies using subterfuge, theatrics and make-up to confuse and confound their mark and obtain their goal. With Tom Cruise in the lead of the film version, it seemed unlikely that this format would hold, and while the film does give a little more depth to it's leads, it is still pushed along by the tale more than the people.The film opens in Prague, where the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) have gathered to perform their latest mission: to prevent a double-agent from selling off a list of the secret identities of covert agents operating in Europe. The team is comprised of leader Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), key man Ethan Hunt (Cruise), electronics expert Jack Harmon (Emilio Estevez), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott-Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), and Jim's wife, Claire (Emmauelle Beart). Part way through the mission, things begin to go horribly wrong, and before the night is out, all members of the team except Hunt are killed by an apparent assassin. Hunt contacts the head of his division, Eugene Kittredge (Henry Czerny) and discovers that the whole mission was designed to capture a suspected mole in the agency, and since Hunt was the only one who survived, he is labeled the mole.Hunt escapes capture and is determined to prove his innocence. With the discovery that Claire did not die during the mission, Hunt makes contact with an arms dealer named Max (Vanessa Redgrave) who the real mole was dealing with and makes his own deal: he will secure the information that Max wants if Max promises to deliver the real mole to him. Hunt recruits former members of the IMF who were discovered during previous missions and had to be 'disavowed' by the U.S. These include super hacker Luther Stickle (Ving Rhames) and helicopter pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno). Together, the group plans their heist, but things quickly become complicated and not everything with this whole operation is as it seems.At the time of it's release, Mission: Impossible was criticized for being so complicated as to be undecipherable, and while it is indeed complex, it is not impossibly so. The film does weave a complicated plot and requires the audience's attention, but that is actually one of the film's strengths. It doesn't proceed in an entirely normal manner, hitting all the usual beats you would expect from a Mission: Impossible story, so while it follows the formula to a degree, it also manages to stand that formula on it's head. If the film does fall short, plot wise, it is principally in one area involving a central twist to the story. From the moment the backstory for this twist is introduced early in the film until the plot finally reveals it, there is nothing terribly surprising about it. The final scenes of the film do suggest that it is not what it would seem to be, but even still, the fact that so major a plot element in a film that is supposed to be a suspense thriller is so easily deduced is a bit of a let down.Mission: Impossible is also not an action film in the literal sense. There is one major action set piece, but it is late in the film's running time, and up until then, the film has had no major car chases or fisticuffs. It replaces those with one major sequence of suspense, in which Ethan Hunt must attempt to retrieve information from a computer in a room littered with sensing equipment, including pressure sensitive floors, temperature controls and audio sensors. This sequence, played largely without dialogue and no music, is effective in building tension and literally putting you on the edge of your seat.Mission: Impossible is not really an actor's movie. All the leads, from Cruise on down, are competent and do their jobs well, but nobody really takes hold of your attention. Cruise is his usual suave self, Rhames is entertaining as Luther Stickle, and Reno is appropriately shady as Kreiger. There is the suggestion of a possible romance between Hunt and Claire, but there isn't much chemistry between the two.Mission: Impossible isn't a great film, but it is a good, effective one. It does require the audience pay attention and, emotionally, it doesn't pack a whallop, but it is good summer popcorn entertainment.",7,16,18,8 June 2006
Super 8," A fine piece of nostalgia
","Minus the computer generated visual effects, and if the credits at the end were lopped off, you might think that Super 8 was made in the late 1970s or early 1980s and was directed by Steven Spielberg. However, while Spielberg is a producer on the film, he did not direct it, that task was handled by J.J. Abrams, but the film plays like a love letter to many of Spielberg's best known works from that era. This isn't a soulless imitation, though, for Super 8 manages to recapture what made those films work well, delivering the audience back to a time, for many of us, of cinematic innocence.Set in 1979 in a small town in Ohio, we are introduced to Joe (Joel Courtney), Charles (Riley Griffiths), Cary (Ryan Lee), Preston (Zach Mills) and Martin (Gabriel Basso), middle school friends working on Charles Super 8 film for entry into a contest. Late one night, driven to a location by Alice (Ellie Fanning), the daughter of a man believed responsible, to an extent, for the recent death of Joe's mother at a nearby factory, the kids manage to capture footage of an immense train crash just outside town. The crash appears to have been instigated by their Biology teacher, Mr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), and the site is quickly overrun by military officials, led by Nelic (Noah Emmerich), who begins a cleanup and encampment in the town that proves worrisome to Joe's father, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), a deputy in the town. When mysterious things begin happening (power flickering, pets disappearing, engines missing out of cars), followed by disappearances of townspeople, Jackson suspects there is more to the situation than the army is revealing. In the midst of these happenings, Charles is trying to finish his movie, but Joe can't help but be pulled into the search for the truth of what is happening as well, while at the same time experiencing a budding young romance taking shape between him and Alice, complicated by their individual fathers not wanting the two kids to intermingle due to the accident at the mill.Super 8 pays homage to so many films that Spielberg either directed, such as E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or films that he had a hand in producing, including The Goonies, but not just by utilizing plot or character elements. No, Super 8 goes the extra mile, to the point that visual and auditory components feel ripped right from that period of time. Individual shots, especially those of the city below and the stars in the sky, match the feel of similar shots from Close Encounters; the lighting, film stock, all of it just oozes respect for those well loved films of that era. Even Michael Giachinno's score echoes the work of John Williams. Giachinno is an exceptional craftsman who has proved able to meld his work with the styles of other composers, and with Super 8 he has worked his magic once again, capturing the heart of the music in Spielberg's earlier works. None of this has the feel of a crass rip-off; it is all assembled with a deep felt love of those films from that period, and works beautifully.One element that Abrams has also managed to capture is the very 'ordinariness' of the characters. These are not superheroes, top trained military operatives or mathematical whizzes. They are average, small town boys, girls and adults, and they very much reflect the audience, much as Spielberg did often in that same era. Abrams has also assembled a fine cast, especially the very capable child actors, led by Courtney and Fanning, who have strong chemistry between them from their first scenes together, and it builds into a sweet, innocent romance that is effectively realized throughout the running time. The other boys also feel as if they are good friends, filled with a degree of curiousness and fear at appropriate times. The adult characters aren't ignored, focusing especially on Jackson, a man who is somewhat lost without his wife and not sure how to raise his son on his own, while also juggling the responsibilities of trying to figure out what is going on in the town. Chandler gives a strong performance, showing both the hard and soft of Jackson appropriately.If there is one element that doesn't quite work in Super 8, it is the central mystery of the film, most specifically its payoff. The 'monster' of Super 8 is well-handled early in the proceedings, Abrams again taking a page from the book of Spielberg, specifically Jaws in this case, taking care to not reveal the central antagonist, keeping it in the shadows for the most part. But as the film builds to its climax, the revelations about the creature, and its eventual full reveal, are somewhat underwhelming, and the degree of emotional resonance with this part of the story is limp, at best. That being said, overall, Super 8 is successful, filling you with a strong sense of nostalgia for an era, and a subset of work by a particular filmmaker, gone by. In a time when directors and writers seem to be constantly trying to cram more and more noise, frenetic action, and jump cut editing into movies, a refreshing look back at when that wasn't the case is welcome, and enjoyed.",8,1,2,5 August 2011
The Fly," One of the great 'horror' films
","Most remakes are simply not the match of the originals that they have pulled their inspiration from.  Usually, they are rather shallow, poor copies of their greater source material, and very few remakes find themselves the film that is better remembered.  Recent examples of this phenomenon are films such as Planet of the Apes, a truly classic film from 1968 that was remade in 2001 with most of what made the original a special event missing. There are, as with anything, exceptions, and one of the greatest, in my opinion, is the 1986 remake of The Fly.  While I have not seen the original film, I cannot believe for an instant that it is the better of the 1986 version, one of the great overlooked films of the 1980's.The original was based on a short story by French author George Langellan and is most well known for it's famous ending where a child finds a fly in the backyard of a house with a man's head on it, about to be attacked by a spider, as well as the flip side featuring a man with a giant fly head wandering around a lab.  It also starred famous Roger Corman player Vincent Price, the most notable name associated with the film.  While many people looked on this film with fond memories, it is also not really viewed as a true 'classic' and that is why in the mid-'80s producer Stuart Cornfeld and screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue hatched a plan to remake the film for modern audiences.  With financial backing from Mel Brooks (a rather unlikely suitor) the team of Cornfeld and Pogue attracted director David Cronenberg to the film.  Cronenberg, a Canadian native who had made several unusual low-budget horror films since the 1970s, had created his own minor subgenre of horror that became known as 'venereal horror' for it's often sexual nature.  The Fly, while much more mainstream than his previous projects to date, would fit his mindset perfectly, and lead to the birth of a veritable masterpiece.The film centers on Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) a scientist who has devoted his life and brilliance to developing teleportation.  He suffers from motion sickness, so his desire to do away with any standard mobile form of transportation makes sense.  While attending a press gathering held by his financial sponsor, Brundle meets and falls for science magazine journalist Veronica 'Ronnie' Quaife (Geena Davis).  She is late of a relationship with the editor of the science magazine Particle, Stathis Borans (John Getz), and is intrigued and attracted to the rather naive, yet charming and charismatic scientist.  They begin a relationship and she begins documenting his development of the teleportation devices (which Brundle dubs 'telepods') for a book to be published after the telepods are complete and fully functional. Brundle is dogged by a rather severe set of drawbacks in the development of the telepods when it comes to transporting living creatures, leading to an early scene where a baboon is teleported and arrives in the sister telepod inside out.  Brundle eventually licks the problem and successfully teleports another baboon.  However, coinciding with the completion of the telepods, Ronnie must deal with Borans who is using her relationship with Brundle to try and get her to commit to writing his story for him, as well as trying to not get her to leave his life.  In a jealous panic when Ronnie goes to see Borans, Brundle decides to test the telepod on himself, while unwittingly sharing the telepod with a normal housefly.  Initially, the teleportation is a success.  However, shortly thereafter, Brundle begins to show changes. He is physically stronger than he previously was, with an increased sexual drive as well.  This is also accompanied by a strong temper and rather displeasing personality at times.  Physically he begins showing some rather strange symptoms as well, such as strong acne and tough hairs growing out of different parts of his body.  Ronnie challenges him on these points, but Brundle just dismisses them, saying she is jealous of his new physical perfection, and he separates from her.  But when his fingernails begin falling out and he finds that to eat, he must regurgitate a strange soupy substance on his food first, even Brundle cannot ignore the reality of what has happened.  He discovers the truth of the event and tries to get Ronnie to help him, but she finds that she cannot continue to support him in the midst of the wild physical and emotional changes he is going through.The Fly received a lot of press for it's at times gruesome imagery, and I can't deny that it isn't the easiest film to sit through if you have a weak constitution.  But, that does not make the film not worth seeing.  While on the surface The Fly is categorized as a 'horror' film, the film cannot be easily and simply classified in that genre.  The film is in fact a strong love story and character study of Seth Brundle.  The film's heart is with the two people at the center.  Goldblum is near perfect as the scientist who knows how to assemble complex machinery and develop brilliant formulas for teleportation, but has a hard time expressing his feelings for Ronnie. It's the ultimate underdog story as the unlikely nerd finds love in the arms of a beautiful woman.  Ronnie is also portrayed well by Geena Davis as a tough journalist who has heard lots of interesting promises from scientists in the field before, but finds herself at first intrigued, and then finally attracted to, Brundle.  Their genuinely touching and involving relationship lays the groundwork for why this film works.  Once their involvement has been established, the film unleashes it's horror elements upon us, in the form of Brundle's disturbing transformations.  Most of the film from about the mid-point on is revealed from Ronnie's point of view and we can only watch in horror as she goes to visit Brundle and see what stage he is in at this point.  The strength of their relationship as developed by Pogue and Cronenberg early in the film makes the latter scenes all the more powerful.Much must be said of the makeup effects created and supervised by Chris Walas.  The film's eventual path lives or dies on the convincingness of the transformations that Brundle must go through, and Walas and his crew pull it off brilliantly.  There are no seams or zippers, no obvious tell-tale signs of makeup work being done here.  We believe, whole-heartedly, in the transformation of Brundle visually, and the film would not be the same without it.  Again, Goldblum helps sell the transformation as well, with his mood swings and erratic behavior, eventually leading to a man scared beyond belief by what is happening to him.  However, it is his powerful, gut-wrenching desire to be whole and human and with Ronnie again where the film's final strength is gleaned from.  The final fifteen minutes are truly difficult to endure first from Goldblum's performance and then from Davis', as the two lovers must come to terms with the inevitable.  There are few other 'horror' films that are as filled with human emotion as The Fly, and this film stands as the crowning achievement in David Cronenberg's oeuvre.",9,1,2,18 January 2004
Thor," Thor proves a strong contender
","In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.Liberally adapting portions of Thor comic book lore to fit in a more modern comic book film reality, Thor introduces us to a centuries old war between the Asgardians, beings that live for long periods of time and can travel through space from their home realm of Asgard to various other worlds, such as Earth, via the Bi-Frost bridge, and the conflict centric Frost Giants, whom the Asgardians conquered some time back. Odin (Anthony Hopkins), ruler of the Asgardians, is preparing to abdicate his throne to his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), but on the eve of Thor's inauguration, agents of the Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and attempt to steal back a device that is the key to their power, which had been taken by Odin at the end of their long struggle. When Thor disagrees with his father's desire to not to retaliate in order to not disturb the peace that currently exists between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants, he takes matters into his own hands, traveling to the Frost Giant's realm with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and compatriots Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Fandral (Josh Dallas) in tow. When the encounter with the Frost Giants ends with tensions re-ignited between the two factions, Odin decides that his son is not prepared to lead his people, and exiles Thor, sans his powers, to Earth.When he arrives on Earth, he is discovered by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who are convinced that he isn't a random homeless vagabond that they found in the middle of the desert. Thor must attempt to locate his power hammer, Mjolnir, from the government agents that have captured it, and attempt to reclaim his place in Asgard. However, he finds that, without his super-human abilities, and surrounded by humans, perhaps some of his previous attitudes were incorrect, especially when he connects romantically with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki, who turns out to have some ulterior motives, seizes control of Asgard following the collapse of Odin from strain, and begins to hatch a grand scheme involving the Frost Giants.Thor, much like Iron Man before it, proves that, in the right hands, a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure, Thor has elements that, on the face of it, may lead a bit to some audience snickers (Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times), but the creatives behind Thor, including director Kenneth Branagh, manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy, pathos, selflessness and, perhaps even more surprisingly, involving character development. Thor is more about the lead characters at its core, again akin to Iron Man, than some other comic book films and this draws the audience into its tale.When it was first announced that Kenneth Branagh would be taking the reins of Thor as a director, it seemed something of an unusual fit for someone best known for his cinematic adaptations of the works of Shakespeare, but the final results of Thor bare out that Branagh was just the right man for the job. Considering the larger-than-life origins of the Thor comic, involving beings with the power and appearance of Gods and the various machinations of their story, the material fits fairly well with Branagh's body of work to a great extent. Especially strong is the development of Loki, who proves to be less of a traditional mustache twirling villain, and more of a misguided soul, trapped between revelations he makes about himself and his past and his respect in his father, making him more of a tragic figure than a black and white comic book antagonist.Thor benefits from strong acting from its leads, Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Hemsworth embodies Thor, first as the brash, acting-before- thinking hero, and later as a man faced with the reality that some of his choices and attitudes were not becoming of a king. Hemsworth really makes you empathize with Thor, and gives you a reason to root for the character throughout the film. Hiddleston, working with the somewhat subdued (at first) Loki eventually transforms him from a seeming weak, malleable person into one who's penchant for vengeance and control is revealed in layers, peeling back one by one through the development of the narrative.Thor isn't without its weak points, however. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster is practically and afterthought, rushed into the narrative at light speed and then not given any room to breathe or develop, it plays more as a requirement of adapting the comic story than something that works organically in the film. Portman is fine in the role, but the screenplay doesn't give enough to this relationship for it to be more than a bump in the road of the film's story.Once again, Marvel has managed to take one of their lesser known heroes and make them the subject of an entertaining film version, with energy and depth that is a bit unexpected. May they keep on making comic book films of this caliber.",8,98,146,3 June 2011
The Happening," An open letter to M. NIght Shyamalan
","Dear Mr. Shyamalan, First, let me preface by saying that I am no basher of yours. I saw and enjoyed your first film, The Sixth Sense, and even managed to avoid learning the twist despite the fact that I didn't see it until it was on home video. I thought your Unbreakable was wildly underrated, being the first 'realistic' comic book movie that many have forgotten. Signs is, to date, your strongest work, in my opinion, featuring a palpable sense of dread and unease to keep you on the edge of your seat. I didn't hate The Village, although it was hardly your shining moment. However, when you made Lady in the Water, it did seem to be an exercise in self-indulgence more than anything else. Sorry, I call them as I see them.I state all that to let you know where I am coming from, when I say that The Happening just isn't cutting it. It is not terrible. I have seen terrible, and The Happening ain't it. However, The Happening does come up wanting quite significantly, in many respects, some that are just impossible to overlook.I will give you points for an interesting premise, in which people in major cities in the US Northeast suddenly begin killing themselves without much warning. Then you introduce us to Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), a schoolteacher in Philadelphia, who flees the city with wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo), with his daughter in tow. We see them escape the city and end up getting stranded in the countryside, where theories about the incidents, originally blamed on terrorists, start to multiply, and the search for a culprit focuses on a more, shall we say, natural cause.You know, I will say, your setup had a great deal of potential. Several scenes in which individuals take their own lives without warning are effective. There is a scene late in the film, which I will not repeat here because we both know what scene we are talking about, that is disturbing. You had a good starting point, I will give you that.However, what really kills The Happening is the performances of the actors. It seems reasonable to assume that, since most of the actors perform in a similar manner, that a lot of the problems are attributable to your direction, I am sorry to report. Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, most of the supporting cast, are all wooden, monotone, lifeless. All the actors seems as if they are reciting something from rote that they needed to regurgitate for a school project. There is little passion, energy, or life to the performances. Some rather cheesy dialogue compounds the problem, so that many scenes are almost laughable. What this does is drain all the energy out of the scenes, not to mention the tension. What should be a riveting, claustrophobic thriller, ends up with almost no atmosphere or suspense at all. It doesn't help that your film gets a bit preachy at the end, which is a somewhat similar issue that befell your Lady in the Water. I don't mind that your films have a 'message', but could you tone them down a little, it makes for a more pleasant viewing experience.All in all, I am certainly not going to give up on you, Mr. Shyamalan. You showed enough power and promise in your early days to remind me that you have plenty of ability. You just need to work a little harder on the execution. I say this with only your best intentions at heart believe me.Your humble viewer, Gerald",5,1,3,23 July 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Good idea to get Reloaded
","When released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded found itself in much the same position as Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace did in 1999. Riding on the coattails of an enormously influential property, expectations for Reloaded were sky high, and much as was the same for Phantom Menace, Reloaded simply couldn't deliver on the outrageously high bar that was set for it. Most critics and viewers look on with Reloaded with a certain amount of disdain and disappointment (Entertainment Weekly recently rated it among the worst sequels of all time), but the film is improperly maligned. While hardly the breakthrough film that the original Matrix was, Reloaded is entertaining in it's own right, albeit with some noticeable chinks in it's armor.Opening some time after the conclusion of the Matrix, Reloaded reveals that the machines that control the planet are massing and burrowing into the Earth to reach the last human city Zion and eradicate the remnants of mankind. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that the same ancient prophecy that directed him to find Neo (Keanu Reeves) also for-tells that Neo will defeat this new threat and Zion will be saved. Neo must travel back into the Matrix to consult with the Oracle (Gloria Foster, in her final role) to discover the truth of what he is to do, and quickly discovers there is a new threat within the Matrix: Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), a computer program designed to hunt down individuals in the Matrix not under machine control, whom Neo destroyed at the end of the Matrix, has returned and now is no longer connected to the machine world. He is copying himself into other parts of the Matrix, so that there are now hundreds, if not thousands, of Smiths, all after the destruction of Neo.Neo discovers that he must reach the Source, the prime code of the Matrix, but to get there, he needs a person named the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), who is being held by an evil program known as the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), while at the same time, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) are constantly being pursued by the agents of the Matrix.The Matrix Reloaded is a complicated film, that is for sure. Where The Matrix was a fairly straightforward picture, without too much in the way of convoluted machinations, Reloaded is a film that is not easy to completely decipher during a single viewing. Writers-directors Andy and Larry Wachowski are obviously full of ideas, and they use Reloaded to present some of these ideas. However, they do not pull this off in a perfect manner. There are several scenes in Reloaded where characters will engage in lengthy conversations about various metaphysical or philosophical issues, and while the underlying ideas are interesting, the film comes to a grinding halt during these scenes. Does the audience really care about these complicated ideas that are presented in a rather unentertaining manner? A film with good ideas is certainly welcome, but The Matrix Reloaded occasionally dips into the arena of academic discussion, and that is not what delivers a rousing good time at the movies.Add to that the fact that Reloaded's plot isn't exactly as tight as a steel trap. At times it is difficult to decipher exactly what the heroes are fighting for or trying to accomplish. It would seem the Wachowski brothers have an idea of their overriding goal, but it comes across in a haphazard and confusing manner at different points in the movie. More than one viewer may find themselves scratching their head throughout Reloaded's running time.All that being said, Reloaded does manage to deliver in the action set piece department. There are no less than three major action sequences, the most impressive of which has been dubbed the 'Burly Brawl,' during which Neo and multiple Agent Smith's face off in a lengthy all-out martial arts marathon. The visual effects in this sequence occasionally falls a bit short, with several moments appearing all too obviously computer generated, but for the most part the Burly Brawl is an engaging sequence. The others, including a multi-vehicular chase, are stunning. As for the film's other visual effects, something for which The Matrix was noted, the work is, on the whole, polished and exceptional. The effects may not be quite as photo-realistic as, say, the work in Minority Report, but it is still effective.The Matrix Reloaded is a flawed film, that is to be sure. It doesn't match The Matrix for it's storytelling conservation and simple freshness, and the film often gets bogged down in it's desire to address a multitude of issues, but it is still and entertaining piece of science fiction-action cinema, and does not deserve the extensive drubbing it has received and perhaps some distance from the hype will allow the Matrix Reloaded to be re-evaluated with a more unbiased eye.",8,1,3,28 March 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," A strong fact-based thriller
","With the success of 2008's Iraq war drama The Hurt Locker under their belts, it shouldn't have been tremendously surprising that director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal would chose to make a film chronicling the decade long search for Osama Bin Laden that culminated in his death at the hands of Navy Seals in May of 2011. The resulting production, Zero Dark Thirty, is a strong, at times involving, story of obsession and the, at times, monotonous and detail oriented search for Bin Laden that largely revolves around a single, dedicated individual.Zero Dark Thirty begins with audio clips of the assault on the Twin Towers of September 11, 2001 and then jumps forward a few years later, where we see the rough interrogation techniques being applied by the CIA to Al Qaeda members to attempt to glean the location of Bin Laden. The early scenes largely focus on fresh CIA analyst Maya (Jessica Chastain) and Dan (Jason Clarke) a more grizzled veteran of relentless torture of the various detainees. The two of them, overseen by the Pakistan chief Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler), utilize a wide variety of approaches to break the men down, getting various references to a shadowy courier of information for Bin Laden, Abu Ahmed. As the years stretch on, various incidents of bombings, including one in London, another in Pakistan, and a devastating attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan, lead the various CIA superiors to begin questioning the search for Bin Laden, but Maya, who has devoted her every waking moment to the hunt, refuses to give in. When a happenstance of information crosses her attention, she is able to eventually determine, with the help of a military operative, Larry (Edgar Ramirez), what she believes is the location of Bin Laden at a heavily fortified compound in Pakistan. She must then convince the CIA that Bin Laden is there so they can move forward with a plan to take him out.Zero Dark Thirty is a film that is driven almost exclusively by plot, recounting the various major events of the years since 2001 to the eventual raid on Bin Laden's compound in 2011. Various characters come and go in the course of the story, but few are given much of an opportunity to grow beyond the technical dialogue they are given to recite. The exception, for the most part, is Jessica Chastain's Maya. We still learn very little about her beyond a few details here and there, but some of that is one of the film's central points: Maya has allowed herself to be all consumed by the search for Bin Laden that she has let it subsume the rest of her life. In one scene, a co-worker of Maya asks her about her friends and a boyfriend, and she cannot respond in the positive to either question. What character driven aspects there are to Zero Dark Thirty are almost exclusively derived from Maya's story.The early scenes of Zero Dark Thirty can prove a bit disorienting to watch at times. The filmmakers throw a lot of acronyms, technical jargon and half explained dialogue at the audience, and it is up to us to try and see if we can keep up. On the one hand, I appreciate the filmmaker's willingness to not dumb down the material to keep it extra accessible for the general movie-going public, but on the other hand, by constantly trying to scratch out some semblance of what is going on, the film does lose of some of it's draw. Eventually, the details begin to coalesce into a story you can generally follow, but at times it feels like we are one step behind the details being unspooled on the screen. Some have criticized Zero Dark Thirty's depiction of torture by the CIA operatives on the various Al Qaeda members, and it even seems to take a neutral stance on the use of those techniques. Many of the torture scenes are harrowing to watch, as human beings are treated as animals by the agents trying to glean information from their prisoners. Zero Dark Thirty isn't a meditation on the ethics and morality of the use of torture, however, it is simply telling a story of what happened, and the filmmakers choose not to shy away from the darker aspects of that hunt.Bigelow and Boal do an exceptional job of building suspense at key moments in the film. More than once, the film will jump to a specific moment in time to correspond to a particular event that occurred over the course of the last 10 years, and the build of tension until a seemingly unavoidable moment of violence unfolds is effective and palpable. Other moments are without warning, as the films forward momentum is suddenly punctuated by an unexpected jolt. Both techniques work well and keep you riveted and involved in the film. The only time this fails to deliver is a late action scene involving Maya outside her home in Pakistan as the film careens towards a rather expected development. It doesn't rob it of power, but it still seems more and more certain before it arrives.Zero Dark Thirty's cornerstone is the final raid on the Bin Laden compound. It unfolds without music, in a very matter of fact fashion, lacking the sensationalism of most thrillers or action films. Zero Dark Thirty lives up to its perception of being true to events as they happened. Nevertheless, this sequence provides an at times moving climax as the events of the previous two hours finally lead to a resolution.Zero Dark Thirty isn't perfect, its early scenes can prove disorienting, and the film's lack of emotional depth can keep us at arm's lengths to the proceedings on the screen at times, but nonetheless, it is an effective thriller that delivers an at times powerful tale of one woman's unwavering dedication to complete her mission, moving all obstacles in her path.",7,1,5,29 January 2013
War of the Worlds," A decent little 'War'
","If there is a director who is cinematically equated with aliens, it has to be Steven Spielberg. The man who brought us Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the ever-popular E.T. has chosen to revisit otherworldly beings again, although this time with a decidedly more malevolent bent, in a new screen version of the famous H.G. Wells novel, The War of the Worlds.Unlike previous incarnations of the tale, or those that have used it for indirect inspiration (such as Independence Day), Spielberg and screenwriters David Koepp and Josh Friedman have chosen to focus the entire film on the point of view of everyman Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his daughter Rachael (Dakota Fanning) and son Robbie (Justin Chatwin). Ray is a blue-collar dockworker in New Jersey who is watching his children for the weekend while his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) and her new husband are visiting her parents in Boston. During the day, strange electrical storms occur that strike several places in the world, including near Ray's home. From the point at which the lightning struck, large tripod devices, obviously under the control by forces not from this planet, unearth themselves and begin laying waste to the human populations of the world. Ray and his family flee the area, moving towards Boston in a desperate attempt to locate Mary Ann, and hopefully, eventually safety.War of the Worlds is a rather somber piece of cinema, to say the least. While not as downbeat as Schindler's List or parts of Saving Private Ryan, War of the Worlds is hardly a light affair. Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski films the entire picture in dark, overcast tones, never really giving us much bright to focus on. Even the scenes set in day are shadowed to a point, never really giving us much of a golden environment, until possibly the end. The character situation is equally downbeat. Ray is not necessarily a good dad, but obviously not a great one either. He has a tumultuous relationship with his son, and while he works better with his daughter, it isn't all wine and roses as well. Spielberg has often been regarded as bringing the view of the average person to the forefront in many of his films, and War of the Worlds is not different in this respect. The invasion of earth by aliens as seen by Ray is the same thing almost all of us would see in the same circumstances. This gives War of the Worlds a different bent, not putting us in the same room as the scientists or military officials that are planning a counter-strike. This is a somewhat refreshing approach to something that has already been done from the other point of view before.Even so, War of the Worlds isn't exactly the most groundbreaking film when it comes to alien invasions. Aside from the original film version, produced in 1953, and such modern accompaniments, including Independence Day, as previously mentioned, War of the Worlds doesn't have a lot new to offer us in the way of imagery or events. We have seen other instances of humans and buildings laid waste to by alien energy weapons, and while the visual effects produced by Industrial Light & Magic and supervised by visual effects maestro Dennis Muren are spectacular and well-integrated into the live action footage, they are not as breathtaking as they would have been in the past. This is a well-trodden path that Spielberg has decided to travel, and he has a lot of baggage to carry. Much of what is offered up is a seeming retread of what has come before, and it is hard for Spielberg to shake that stigma.Performance wise, Tom Cruise again displays that he a more than capable performer. His Ray is a man trapped in a situation that he doesn't fully understand and seems somewhat incapable of handling at times, made all the worse by having to deal with his two children, who are not on the best of terms with their father. Cruise has played individuals with sorted pasts before, and he is willing to make his character vulnerable and a bit juvenile, as appropriate. Dakota Fanning, easily the best working child actor today, gives her usual top-flight performance, but she is not really pushed to any unusual limits by the script. Justin Chadwick is a bit overdone as the rebellious son, and has to deal with some strange directions the script sends him in. He comes across as a bit of a whiner. Tim Robbins has a small role as an unhinged survivalist who proves to be a danger to Ray and his family.All in all, War of the Worlds is an engaging entry in the alien invasion sweepstakes of cinema, and with it's more personal approach, it sticks out a bit in the crowd, but not enough to be an absolute knockout.",7,1,3,8 August 2005
30 Days of Night," An effective Night
","30 Days of Night has a premise that seems undeniably suited for a vampire movie: in Alaska resides a town named Barrow, the northernmost city of the United States. During winter, for 30 days, the sun never rises, bathing the city in a perpetual darkness during that period. Comic book creators Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith used this as the basis for their tale of a group of vampires that arrive in Barrow to feed for those 30 days on the unwitting, and largely trapped, populace of Barrow. Director David Slade has now brought the tale to the big screen, and while it is hardly a perfect horror film, it is a cut above many others in some time and provides the appropriate thrills for the audience.As stated above, the setting is Barrow, beginning the day before the 30 day sunless cycle kicks off. Sheriff Eben (Josh Harnett) spends that last day investigating a number of unusual occurrences around the town: burned cell phones, murdered sled dogs, the only helicopter damaged beyond repair. As the sun sets, the town finds itself cut off from the rest of the world, and quickly under siege, as vampires have arrived at Barrow and begin feeding on the population, first just a few on the outskirts of town, but eventually moving en masse. Finding guns incapable of stopping the attackers, a group of survivors, led by Eben, and including his estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George) hole up in an attic and lay the groundwork for surviving the seemingly endless darkness.30 Days of Night is not scary in a traditional sense. Even with some scenes of suspense, the film instead relies on the adrenaline rush of watching the survivors attempt to avoid detection by the undead, who utilize their stealth and the bait of other survivors to try to lure their prey into the open. The vampires are appropriately creepy, covered in blood from their victims, and attack with a ravenousness that vampires have typically lacked in previous screen appearances. These vampires are monsters, pure and simple, and that is reflected in several scenes where they confront their prey and fill the audience with unease since we are relatively certain the humans will not survive.Despite the fact that 30 Days of Night is not a character-driven piece, Slade still manages to evoke a degree of feeling and sympathy for his human protagonists. The film deals in the sticky territory of who lives and who dies when faced against seemingly insurmountable odds, and also the questions of whether the choices made, even when the outcome seems obvious, are the right ones from a moral standpoint. 30 Days of Night is not some treatise on the human condition, it is still a horror thriller, but the fact that it takes the time to consider the issues is better than we usually get from a film of its genre.Acting-wise, the cast is solid, if not amazing. Josh Hartnett is appropriately stolid as Sheriff Eben, but also manages to communicate his desire to try and keep those around him alive while his world seems to be unraveling at the same time. Danny Huston portrays the vampire leader, Marlow, and while he is not given anything in the way of English dialogue (the vampires speak in some subtitled foreign language), he conveys an appropriate sense of meance.Visually, 30 Days of Night is effective, showing the dark world of Barrow, and director Slade and cinematographer Jo Willems do a good job of conveying dread by often populating the edges of the screen with the vampires lurking, ready to strike. The makeup effects that realize the vampires keeps them appropriately evil, but the work in this department is hardly groundbreaking.30 Days of Night is no masterpiece, and Slade's previous effort, the disturbing Hard Candy, was a much better movie, but nonetheless, 30 Days of Night is effective and efficient, so if you like horror films, it's worth checking out.",7,2,5,22 October 2007
Wedding Crashers," I'm ready to 'Crash' this party
","Wedding Crashers is a throwback to comedy films that haven't been made with any regularity since the early 1980s: the sex comedy. I'm not referring to films full of innuendo or double entendres, but full on nudity and the raw language and outrageousness to back it up. For the most part, Wedding Crashers succeeds at creating a fun and funny romp, but it falls a little shy of being consistently hilarious.Wedding Crashers is the story of John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughan), two mediators who spend every spring season crashing weddings together to pick up girls and have sex with them. These guys are two slick professionals who have been at this a long time and know all the ins and outs of Wedding Crashing: what to say, who to claim you are related to, what kind of spectacle to put on to get yourself in with the susceptible ladies. Jeremy discovers that upcoming is a major wedding for one of the daughters of Secretary of the Treasury Cleary (Christopher Walken). It is while crashing this wedding that John finds himself falling for one of the available daughters, Claire (Rachael McAdams), while Jeremy sets his sights on the other daughter, Gloria (Isla Fisher), who turns into what Jeremy describes as a 'stage-5 clinger' which basically means she has developed an infatuation for him that he is not interested in. When Gloria invites them back to the family grounds for a weekend of fun, John is determined to get Claire away from her uber-competitive and arrogant boyfriend Zach (Bradley Cooper) and describe his love to her.Wedding Crashers is a film where most of the humor revolves around placing John and Jeremy in situations that force them to concoct elaborate lies and stories to keep themselves from being found out. Most of the film's best humor comes from Vince Vaughan, who is constantly playing fall guy to John's straight guy. Vince Vaughan is attacked by Zach during a family touch football game, sexually drained by Gloria in situations that rapidly explode in outrageousness, as well as the unwanted sexual advances of the Cleary son Todd (Keir O'Donnell), who is homosexual. Vaughan does a great job of portraying a man who's fun weekend of sexual debauchery is quickly descending into a nightmare. His terrifically cynical delivery is also perfect for the part.Wilson on the other hand is given the role of the man who is growing tired of the endless strings of one-night stands and is looking for something more permanent. Wedding Crashers has a serious side to it, with the romantic angle of John and Claire discovering and exploring their mutual attraction. Wilson is capable in the part, but he doesn't make quite the impression Vaughan does after the film's early scenes. He has the somewhat thankless role of playing the straight man in a raunchy sex comedy when some of the audience is undoubtedly looking for more laughs instead of a growing serious streak to film. On the female side of the equation, both Rachael McAdams and Isla Fisher are standouts. McAdams, who I had not seen in a film previously, has a great, easy charm and atmosphere about her that seems enormously genuine. She has a great smile and her line delivery doesn't feel the least bit forced or stock. She is a natural actress and I would love to see her in more films in the future. Fisher is also enormously memorable for her borderline insane Gloria. She plays the role of sexually awakened and starved Gloria with such verve as to believe it. Her scenes are a bit over-the-top, but they provide the film with some of it's best humor.As mentioned previously, the film does meander into a more serious story towards the end and the humor drops off noticeably. This is a trend that has become common in many comedies in recent years, and I wish it would start subsiding. I don't mind serious films, but when I walk into a comedy, I am ready to laugh, and straight subplots that hijack the film have become all the more frequent and unnecessary. Bring me the unending humor any day.Even so, Wedding Crashers is funny enough when it is funny as to garner a recommendation, and it is also good to see a film not afraid to push some limits that used to not be commonplace. If you are looking for a good laugh, Wedding Crashers is worth checking out.",7,1,2,8 August 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Not a horror, a tragedy
","With the possible exception of Frankenstein's monster, there isn't a more venerated horror icon than that of Count Dracula. Created by novelist Bram Stoker in the late 1800's, Dracula is popular culture's ultimate icon of the idea of vampirism, the idea of the dead continuing to exist by feeding on the living. The most famous and enduring adaptation of the material is Universal's 1933 version, which starred Bela Lugosi and created the image of Dracula which has become the yardstick by which all versions are measured. In the early 1990's, director Francis Ford Coppolla decided to try his hand at the Count, and while his Bram Stoker's Dracula will most likely never be viewed as the definitive take on the novel, it is to me one of the more successful I have seen.I must admit that upon first viewing, Bram Stoker's Dracula didn't make much of a impression on me. It was a visually interesting work, that's for sure, but I felt that it was, like many of Coppolla's other 'experiments,' an example of style over substance. It was only with repeat viewings that I began to see what I was missing the first time: this version of Dracula is much more a story of a tragic character trapped in damnation by his love for his lost bride than a horror story about an unredeemable creature tormenting the living.Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), working for a London real-estate firm, is dispatched to the wilds of Transylvania, where he is to complete transactions with the mysterious Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) to purchase several properties in London. Once he arrives at his host's home, though, he quickly notices that all is not normal with the Count. The castle he inhabits is practically empty and in a decrepit state; the Count speaks of events of the distant past with the fervor and memory of a man who lived them, and the Count fails to eat, drink, or cast a reflection in a mirror. Upon seeing a picture of Harker's intended bride, Mina Murray (Winona Ryder) in a locket, Dracula believes her to be the reincarnation of his bride, Elisabeta, who took her own life in 1462 believing her husband killed in a battle with Muslim Turks that were invading Transylvania, which caused Dracula to renounce God and enter his current state, that of the walking undead. Dracula imprisons Harker in his castle and then sets out for London with the intention of taking Mina for his own.Meanwhile, Mina is living with her friend Lucy Westerna (Sadie Frost) who is busy juggling suitors, eventually deciding on Lord Holmwood (Cary Elwes), but not before Dracula can arrive and begin feeding on Lucy, turning her slowly into his minion. Another of Lucy's potential suitors, Dr. Seward (Richard E. Grant), has summoned an old mentor of his, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) to assist in the case. It is Van Helsing who determines that Lucy's illness is not a disease, but the result of the feeding of a vampire. While using Lucy to meet his dietary needs, Dracula is trying to forge a relationship with Mina, but his plans are dashed when Harker escapes from his castle and Mina rushes to reunite with him, even as she is realizing that she does have feelings for the Count after all.In a departure from Stoker's material, screenwriter James V. Hart have transformed the character of Dracula from soulless creature to tragic figure. When the story has no real villain, it becomes difficult to root for the hero's to succeed, which makes Dracula a confusing watch, especially the first time. However, when viewed in the context of a tragedy, it becomes a more engaging story than if you were looking for a more traditional scare-fest.There are several standout elements in Coppolla's production, but few are more impressive than Gary Oldman's turn as Dracula. He embodies the character's naked ambition to be reunited with his love, mixed with his unending need to feed on the living. Oldman is most impressive as the aged Dracula seen at the beginning of the picture, before he transforms himself into a younger version to attract Mina. In the scenes set in the castle, Oldman commands the screen with his performance and is a treasure to watch.The film is also visually stunning, boasting some impressive costume design from Eiko Ishioka, giving a very different, more Asian influenced look to the characters in many situations that is a departure from the normal black coat that Dracula is most famous for. Coppolla and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus also utilize color rather boldly in the film instead of painting everything in various shades of gray as previous productions have been apt to do.This is not to suggest that the film doesn't have weaknesses. Aside from Oldman and Hopkins as the eccentric Van Helsing, the supporting cast is lackluster, most especially Elwes and Reeves. While the change in focus on Dracula from evil villain to tragic hero makes it more palatable for the other characters to not have much of an impact, the wooden performances from the supporting players is a significant failing of the film. Reeves, especially, seems miscast in the role of Harker, seemingly spending all his time focusing on his English accent and not on his performance. The star qualities later on display in films such as Speed and The Matrix are all but missing here. One final standout, though, is Sadie Frost as Lucy. She plays the character with a great deal of energy and playfulness, first as the young débutante searching for a suitor, then as Dracula's minion.When all is said and done, Bram Stoker's Dracula stands somewhat in the upper-middle of the stack of adaptations of the famous novel, but not quite at the top. The most important fact to remember when watching the film is to not expect a story of terror, but one of pathos.",8,1,3,12 February 2005
Hancock," Superhero movie with an identity complex
","In the modern era of comic book/superhero adaptation movies, Hancock is an attempt to create an original character and also imbue him with all too human frailties. The resulting film, directed by Peter Berg and starring Will Smith, is entertaining and involving, at times, for it's first two thirds, but fails to wrap things up satisfactorily at the end.As the film opens, we are introduced to Hancock (Will Smith), a man with superpowers, including the ability to fly, invulnerability and super strength. Hancock also has some significant character flaws: he is an alcoholic, appears unkempt and is generally uninterested in putting on a pleasant front for the public, offending almost everyone he comes in contact with. He also has developed a bit of a problem on the legal front, as most of heroic escapades end up with an associated property damage cost, which has resulted in multiple lawsuits, and the L.A. DA wants him behind bars.After saving the life of Ray Embry (Jason Bateman), a public relations professional, from a train accident (in which Hancock manages to derail the train and upset the commuters around him) Embry takes Hancock under his wing and makes him a personal project, with the aim of rehabilitating Hancock's tarnished public image. He invites him to his home to meet his family, including wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who gives Hancock some suspicious looks . . .At the outset, Hancock is an interesting take on the superhero tale, set perhaps in the most real world yet for a film of it's type. Here, as Hancock flies about doing good deeds, he manages to crash into things, tear up buildings, destroy yachts, and, frankly, people don't seem too happy. It is a sad comment on modern society that it is very probable that if a super-hero did exist, this is how he would be greeted by the masses.The script, credited by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, features a number of funny segments in the early scenes as Hancock interacts with the public and gives them his devil may care attitude. Hancock is a tortured character, saddled with super-powers and an innate desire to do good, but he also cannot cope with the loneliness of his existence, and so has turned to liquor to try to survive. Will Smith does an exceptional job bringing Hancock to life, making him somewhat likable, simply by being Will Smith, but also not being afraid to show Hancock as the jackass he is at times.However, at the three quarters mark, Hancock suddenly transforms into an almost completely different film and runs off the rails. It moves into a more 'serious' vein and introduces some borderline metaphysical elements, while also delving into Hancock's origin. But, frankly, this material fails to grab you. Hancock was much more interesting when trying to fight through his rehabilitation, driven by Ray, than the left-turn the plot takes the film in towards the end. Hancock seems to want to drive home a powerful, emotional climax, but it manages to do the opposite, robbing the film of it's strength.Smith, as mentioned before, is the anchor of the film and proves once again what an exceptional actor he is. Hancock largely works because of him, giving Hancock a injured soul, but one that still has good at it's center. Jason Bateman is amusing in the role of Ray, but his family story with Mary isn't anything tremendously special or unique, and Theron doesn't turn in a bad performance, but isn't really given a lot to work with either.If Hancock had stayed the course of it's original ideas, it may have been a strong contender for a great summer movie, but it's abrupt change of focus brings the film to a less than satisfying conclusion, which is a shame.",6,2,5,6 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The saga is over
","With the release of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas has brought his epic space saga to a close, and to what I would imagine is the relief of fans everywhere, he takes it out on a high note. Revenge of the Sith, is, by far, the strongest of the three prequel films Lucas began releasing in 1999.Revenge of the Sith still exhibits many of the weaknesses of his previous two entries: questionable dialog, some occasionally silly scenes and performances that don't always show the actors in their best light. But this is all trivial compared to the good aspects of Revenge of the Sith: engaging action sequences, outstanding visual effects and the most involving dramatic moments featured in a Star Wars film.As the film opens, the Galactic Republic is still in the throes of war with separatists that began at the conclusion of the previous film. We are treated to an breathtaking extended action sequence that features Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) attempting to rescue the Galactic Republic's Chancellor, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), from the clutches of Sith Lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and the robot army leader, General Grevious (voiced by Matthew Woods). After the success of the mission, Anakin is reunited with his secret wife, Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), who reveals she is pregnant with his child. Plagued by dreams of Padme's death during childbirth, Anakin finds himself more and more susceptible Palpatine's insinuations of learning the power available to one from the Dark Side of the Force. When a critical juncture is reached during the war, the Jedi, not trusting Palpatine's motives, decide to seize the Republic from him, with dire results. Palpatine then convinces Anakin to become his apprentice, with the reward being learning a method to save Padme from death, and so he takes the name Darth Vader. Palpatine then sends him on a mission to wipe out the remaining Jedi and bring the war to a close, while Palpatine manipulates the Galactic Senate into becoming the Galactic Empire under his rule.Most of the details of the plot are familiar to anyone who is fan of the original trilogy, so the outcome of the events of this film are hardly a surprise. However, George Lucas imbues the film with a stronger element of drama than any previous entry in the series. There is some powerful, emotional material on display here, intertwining the fates of various characters in a complex web of deceit and betrayal. Especially moving is the plight of Anakin Skywalker. His character is so desperate to keep everyone that he loves that he actually causes the very things he fears by holding on too tight and making questionable choices. More than any character in the Star Wars saga, Anakin is a decidedly tragic figure, and you cannot help but feel a strong sense of pathos for him as the film progresses.Lucas also delves into the nature of a totalitarian regime and how it can spring up, rather unforeseeable, from a strong and virile democracy. For the first time in the Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith also introduces some shades of grey into the conflict between good and evil, where previously everything had been depicted in black and white. The Jedi are presented almost borderline arrogant, sure of their passionless approach to the universe, while the Sith seem to embrace the affections of others. That does not necessarily change the conflict, the Sith are still evil, the Jedi good, but how Anakin perceives the situation is what gives the new nuances some strength.Of course, a Star Wars film wouldn't be a Star Wars film without some serious eye-candy, and Revenge of the Sith delivers in spades. The elaborate opening space battle is impressive, the screen filled to bursting with visual information. There are several digital characters in the film, the most interesting being General Grevious. He is a mix of machine and living being, and he is no less a character than any flesh and blood actor featured in the film. Yoda returns to the digital fold again after first being rendered with ones and zeroes for Episode II, and again he holds up just as well as the puppet of old.We are also treated to several elaborate action set-pieces, the strongest being the climactic lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan. The battle unfolds on the surface of a molten lava planet named Mustafar, and setting is appropriate for Anakin's decent into his own personal hell. The battle on Mustafar is intercut with a similar duel between Yoda and Palpatine in the Galactic Senate chamber, and both hold our attention without fail.If Episode III has a weakness, it's the acting and dialogue. While most of the performers do a serviceable job, at times they falter, struggling with clunky dialogue. That being said, Episode III does feature at least one standout performance, that of Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. Delivering what I think is strongest performance to date in any Star Wars film, McDiarmid shines as Palpatine moves his plans from the background to the forefront. Ewan McGregor brings some levity to the proceedings with his jovial performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but is serious when necessary. Hayden Christensen brings his work up a notch from Episode II with the darker, more serious Anakin. While he is saddled with some of the worst dialogue, he still manages it well.And so, after better than 20 years, the book is finally (theoretically) closed on Star Wars. I, for one, was glad to be there for the ride, and happy to see it go out on a strong note. May the Force be with you.",9,7,11,22 July 2005
Prometheus," Prometheus a solid, if not great, film
","Over the last year or so, fandom has been awash in hope and desire that Prometheus, the new film from Ridley Scott, and his return, if perhaps somewhat peripherally, to the Alien franchise he began in 1979 would be a welcome return to form for that series after a spiraling set of latter sequels and the infantile spinoffs in the form of the odious Alien vs. Predator films. Well fans, rejoice to some extent: Prometheus is certainly a fair sight better than the above mentioned films. It, however, will leave those who are expecting both a horror film and a very Alien-centric picture disappointed to a large extent, as Prometheus uses only the framework of the Alien universe to tell a wholly new tale, one that is more interested in asking questions than in giving you shocks.Opening in 2089 on Earth in Scotland, archeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered a similar pictorial representation of a star system at multiple scientific digs. Using this information, they have convinced aging wealthy industrialist Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to fund an expedition to the star system depicted in the images in the hopes of making contact with what Shaw and Holloway refer to as the 'Engineers', aliens they think may have helped engineer the beginnings of life on Earth. Once they arrive on the planet, the team discovers large structures that contain various chambers and artifacts, mostly small canisters, as well as one decapitated alien body. In the course of engaging in their research and exploration, they find themselves hampered at times by the limitations placed on them by their corporate boss, Vickers (Charlize Theron), and are also helped by android David (Michael Fassbender). But, as things unfold, the motivations of some of the crew begin to come into question, and the things they discover on the planet make them begin to wonder if it was a trip that was wrong to make.Prometheus is very interested in tackling some 'big' issues: the origin of mankind, the mix of faith and science and the search for immortality. Unlike many other modern science-fiction films, it isn't all slam-bang, hyper edited action. In fact, much of Prometheus is comprised of scenes of dialogue and moments of characters pondering what they have discovered. Science fiction movies with a degree of wonder and introspection are a rare creature these days, so the fact that Prometheus seems genuinely interested in exploring some of these themes is impressive in and of itself.Prometheus doesn't completely skimp on the scare quotient. While I would hardly describe it as a full on horror film, Prometheus has more than its share of jumps, tension and squirms, albeit these moments are often secondary to other elements in the film, but they deliver when necessary. Prometheus definitely benefits from impressive visual design and cinematography from Arthur Max and Darius Wolski, respectively. It also does an exceptional job of revisiting the designs of H.R. Giger that were originally crafted for Alien. While there isn't much new design material here from Giger, seeing his ideas on screen again reminds you of what a unique and interesting designer he truly is.Where Prometheus falls down, largely, is in the character department. Almost none of the main characters are really developed or given more than a cursory amount of personality. They are not neglected completely, but the audience doesn't really connect with them. Most of the development is given to Shaw and her search for answers about man's creation, but almost all the rest are provided with enough dialogue to serve the plot, and not a lot else. One of the most interesting characters in the film is actually the android David, who vacillates between being a helpful assistant to some of the humans to also having ulterior motives that may or may not be in the best interest of the crew. Fassbender does an exceptional job of making David have the outer appearance of warmth and congeniality, while hiding a cold, calculating core beneath the surface. David is a fascinating at times, and proves one of the more memorable elements in the film.For those who are looking for Prometheus to give them some Alien action, they will have to make do with the suggestion of the film setting up some of the material of the first entry in that franchise. Prometheus does borrow some of the feel of the first Alien at times, especially in some middle scenes involving secondary crew members whose curiosity gets the best of them, but this film is not really an Alien movie, but a prequel in the truest sense of the word: it sets the table, but leaves before the meal is served.Prometheus is a good, if unspectacular, science fiction film from director Scott that wants to play in the field of ideas and not just the space fantasy that many other films seem to be only interested in doing. While the lack of depth to the characters can at times keep the viewer at arm's length, in terms of look and feel, Prometheus delivers the goods. May Ridley Scott not wait another 30 years to re-enter the science fiction realm.",7,19,37,10 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," A prequel that works
","Typically when a film franchise decides to move into prequel territory, it rarely bodes well for the quality of the final product. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, and X-Men: First Class is one of them. First Class brings the X-Men film franchise back from the land of mediocrity it seemed headed toward with the previous entry, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and manages to mine some strong character material by revisiting where everything began.X-Men: First Class opens in Poland in 1944 (and actually features footage from the original X-Men movie) in which we see young Erik Lensherr tortured by malevolent Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) where he learns to harness his magnetic powers, but only when put through severe emotional trauma. Meanwhile, in America Charles Xavier comes face to face with another mutant, Raven Darkholme, and his family takes her in as an adopted sister. 20 years later, Charles (James McAvoy) is studying for an advanced degree in genetics, Erik (Michael Fassbender) is on a mission to exact revenge on Shaw, and the world at large is just becoming aware of the existence of mutants. Shaw is hatching a plan to turn humans against one another so he and other mutants can emerge victorious from the carnage if humanity goes to war with itself, and only Charles and Erik, who begin recruiting mutants to help them thwart Shaw's plan, stand between humanity and nuclear war.Many prequels exist simply to fill in the blanks between the known details of a franchise, and X-Men: First Class does tread some of that territory, as to be expected. But, for the most part, First Class works best when delving into the relationships between the characters who would be already established in the future X-Men films. The film focuses a fair amount of screen time on fleshing out Charles and Erik, as well as Charles and Raven, giving their interactions a degree of tragedy and pathos when viewed from the lens of the future. Raven, portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence, gets the majority of the depth that had not even really been hinted at in the other X-Men films, portraying her as someone who views Charles as much more than just an adopted brother, but also having to come to terms with the fact that her natural appearance, covered in blue scales, causes others, even Charles, to flinch, and she begins to realize that her path and Charles' will diverge in the future.One of the strengths of First Class is in the casting of Kevin Bacon as the villainous Shaw. Bacon manages to deliver both a magnetic and threatening performance, someone who is always seemingly one step ahead of the people around him that he views as inferior to his evolved self. While Bacon is hardly restrained, he doesn't take Shaw over the top into the realm of parody or silliness. The other standout is the always engaging Michael Fassbender in the role of Erik. He embodies the rage and desire for revenge in Erik, on a mission to avenge his tragic past while also never trusting the humans surrounding him. When Fassbender is on screen, he commands the scene, and gives Erik a strong, memorable presence.Lest you think X-Men: First Class is all darkness and unhappiness, it actually has a rather light touch at times. Director Mathew Vaughan manages to infuse the proceedings often with, dare I say it, a sense of fun, especially in scenes where the various X-Men are learning to use and harness their powers. There is also a degree of homage in many scenes in the film, both to the era in which it is set, the swinging early '60s, and to films of that era (you can't watch the scenes set in the war room and not think of Dr. Strangelove). There is a bit of tweaking of stereotypes of that era, such as sexism and the intolerance that was beginning to melt off society as the decade progresses. X-Men: First Class is by no means perfect. In an attempt to hit many of the bases of setting up the future films, some elements feel a bit rushed and unexplored, glossed over instead of being given the room to breathe that it sometimes feels like it needs. Also, as with the initial three X-Men films, not all the characters are given the opportunity to be fully drawn, and some of the more peripheral characters are left underdeveloped.That said, X-Men: First Class performs what would almost seem a cinematic miracle: it manages to save a franchise that many had written off. It is unsure what the future holds for the X-Men films, but if a few more like First Class can be served up, then they will be worth watching.",8,4,8,3 June 2011
Iron Man," Iron Man more interested in the Man than the Iron
","If there is one thing that makes Iron Man a cut above many comic book movies, and on par with such entries as Batman Begins and Superman Returns, it is it's reliance on character and the actions that occur because of decisions that emanate from them, and not the machinations of plot. Iron Man is a story about it's central character, Tony Stark, and he is carried well by performer Robert Downey, Jr.Iron Man opens in Afghanistan, where Stark, millionaire weapons developer, is showing off his latest product for the military. The convoy he is riding in is attacked, and Stark is captured by rebels, who demand he build them a version of his new weapon. Stark instead uses the parts and tools to fashion a suit of armor to help him escape, and keep him alive by preventing some shrapnel lodged in his chest from entering his heart.After Stark manages to escape from his captors, he returns to home, and announces to the world that his company will stop weapons production, which doesn't go over well with his board or directors, or his longtime partner and friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). While the political machinations are going down, Stark is busy tinkering with his armor design to get it perfected, and when he sees the atrocities going on around the world, often using weapons from his company, he decides to use the armor to act.At the plot level, Iron Man is nothing tremendously special. It follows a typical superhero origin story, letting us see how the superhero came into being, the early testing of powers, etc. In that respect, Iron Man is nothing to write home about. However, given that framework, director John Favreau and screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway use it to build the story around the cataclysmic change that sends Tony Stark from being a millionarie playboy who spouts platitudes about how weapons protect the US to a man awakened to the bitter realities that surround him that he had previously shut out.What helps sell Tony Stark is the strong performance of Robert Downey, Jr. Downey, in concert with the script, makes Tony Stark less of your typical superhero and more of an average, if someone eccentric, guy. Yes, Stark is a genius, and has a quirky personality, but he still manages to seem a bit like someone you know and like spending time with. Downey's exceptional dialogue delivery, paired with his devil may care attitude, makes Tony Stark a memorable comic book hero.Iron Man imbues it's secondary characters, even the minor ones, with enough development for us to care about what happens to them, so that when the action sequences occur, we have an rooting interest in the outcome, making them more than just random pyrotechnics. Favreau and company don't accomplish the best action sequences in modern comic book action film-making, but they work well enough to be entertaining.Most of the other performances are up to par, with Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's right hand woman, Pepper Potts, who has a somewhat unrequited interest in Stark. Jeff Bridges portrays Obadiah Stane with both a seemingly well-intentioned interest in Stark's success, but also a just under the surface sense of menace. Terrence Howard fills the role of reliable associate with good aplomb as Rhodey, Stark's longtime military friend.What Iron Man proves, and other filmmakers toiling in the comic book world would do well to take notice of, is that when you bring the focus of your story in on the people at the heart of it, and match them with good actors, the results can be exceptional. We can only hope Iron Man is the continuation of a trend that keeps growing.",8,2,3,5 July 2008
Identity," Good, but another big 'surprise'
","Identity is the latest in a long line of recent thrillers that seems to live for 'the twist.'  Popularized recently mostly by films written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, 'the twist' is a feature of a film that develops in one direction to suddenly end up in another.  Much to my surprise, Identity handles it's primary twist well, and I commend it for that.  However, on the way to it's main twist, it tries to hard to build in others that are quickly revealed, much to my chagrin.The film is set primarily at a lonely motel in the middle of the desert.  A group of strangers, from various walks of life, find themselves stranded at this motel in the midst of a torrential rain storm.  One by one, they begin to die off in various rather gruesome ways, leaving the survivors to be suspicious of each other as to who is the killer.  The characters are all different, and as such utilizes the seeming requirement that a film with this kind of situation (small group of characters trapped in a secluded location) feature unique, and sometimes slightly weird, 'types' to fill out it's roster.  The primary character is Ed, played by John Cusack, a limo driver transporting a fallen movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) to a job, and he quickly finds himself in his element as a former policeman while trying to solve the murders. The rest of the bunch is composed of Rhodes (Ray Liotta), a detective transporting Robert Maine (Jake Busey), a convicted killer; Paris (Amanda Peet) a prostitute on the way to a better life; newlyweds Ginny (Clea Duvall) and Lou (William Lee Scott); Larry (John Hawkes) the motel manager, and finally George (John C. McGinley) a rather mawkish man who's wife was injured in a traffic accident.  Even though they are 'types' most of the actors do a good job of filling out their characters.Identity is a stylish looking film, full of wet, dark imagery that increases the creep factor extensively.  The film is also suspenseful throughout, featuring plenty of genuine scares and surprises for the most part. However, as the film continues to run, it becomes obvious that we, the audience, are being set up for a switch in the film's basic premise, which I will not reveal here.  However, it is not too surprising when this switch happens, as various earlier scenes telegraph it to us.  Director James Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney have slightly sabotaged one of the film's central conceits by constantly reminding us of what appears at first to be a subplot and eventually turns out to be the movie's primary plot.  I think that this twist would have worked better had there been almost no setup, or at least a lot less than was featured.That being said, Cooney and Mangold aren't through with us after that first twist.  There are others to come, and the final one is quite a surprise that was not nearly as obvious.  From that point of view, Identity is a success, proving that a filmmaker can still surprise the audience in a time when thrillers abound with twist endings becoming more and more unsurprising in their revelations.  You occasionally find yourself wishing that directors and writers would just make a straightforward thriller and leave the twists and turns in the past occasionally instead of always trying to formulate the next big 'surprise.'",8,1,2,18 January 2004
Beowulf," A sumptuous visual feast
","In the ever evolving medium that is the motion picture, director Robert Zemeckis has thrown down the latest gauntlet in the arena of visual wonder with his computer animated adaptation of the epic poem Beowulf. Released in IMAX 3D, REAL-D 3D and standard two dimensional projection simultaneously, Beowulf is nothing short of a eye-popping marvel that proves a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The fact that it is not a masterpiece in other areas, but still a decent entertainment, does not dull its ability to provoke wonder for the audience.Alternately an adaptation and a deconstruction of the tale most of us have had to tread through, to some degree, in grade school, Beowulf opens in Denmark in 507 AD, where King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) has emerged victorious from an ongoing conflict with a neighbor. Reveling in his Mead Hall, Hrothgar and his people are attacked by Grendel (Crispin Glover) a rather pathetic, yet powerful creature who's ears prove sensitive to sounds of merriment. Hrothgar sends word that he needs a hero to defeat Grendel, and Beowulf (Ray Winstone), a warrior in search of glory, answers the call for help.He fights Grendel and eventually finds himself face-to-face with the creature's mother (Angelina Jolie), where he makes a deal with her that proves to be his undoing later in life. The film's final act finds Beowulf, now the King of Hrothgar's lands, fighting a dragon that is praying on the populace.Beowulf, is, first and foremost, a film that is designed to be looked at admiringly. Zemeckis had previously worked with the performance-capture animation technology for his 2004 Christmas epic The Polar Express, which was an equally impressive visual achievement, but Beowulf is definitely the superior on this front. From the detailing on the character's skin to the vistas and environments that the story inhabits, Beowulf is an impressive achievement in animation. The decision to attempt to replicate reality, to some degree, does place Beowulf in the unenviable position, unlike animated features that adapt an approach that chooses to stylize their environments, of being easily compared to the 'real world', and in that respect, it does prove difficult to not occasionally come up wanting, or sometimes cause the characters to have a plastic look to them. But the very detailed nature of what is on display overcomes this limitation and Beowulf does not disappoint in the visual category.Outside of the visual splendor of the production, Beowulf exhibits traits of drama, action, comedy and tragedy in mixed degrees. The screenplay, by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery, isn't afraid to have a little fun with the proceedings, featuring some cheesy, yet humorous dialogue, not to mention an extended sequence in which Beowulf strips naked to confront Grendel because Grendel will not be facing him with any weapons or clothing. This leads to scenes where Zemeckis has to choreograph the action so that Beowulf's privates, computer generated as they would be, are obscured by objects and environmental elements, such as fog. Beowulf is a film that is not afraid to play it a little loose.At the same time, Beowulf slowly builds a strong emotional undercurrent that takes hold in the last third of the film, and examines the frailty of heroes, the accuracy of tales of adventure and conquest and the weaknesses of men in general. While the material is not quite as emotionally resonant as it might be with real actors, Gaiman, Avery and Zemeckis do manage to leave you thinking. Much like post-modern horror films such as Scream, Beowulf wants to not take the epic tales of heroes at face value, but also look at the reality underneath and the cracks in the armor.It is difficult to judge the performances in a film such as this. The actors 'filmed' their scenes themselves on a empty stage covered in tracking markers, so the actions are ostensibly theirs, but the images have been adjusted by the visual artists after the fact. Even so, based on what is on display, Winstone is appropriately full of vigor and bluster as the younger Beowulf, and then melancholy and reflection as the older version. Angelina Jolie displays a seductive side as Grendel's mother, and Crispin Glover manages to realize a Grendel that is much more pitiable than frightening.Beowulf is just one more example of the encroachment of technology on film-making, as the lines between animation and live-action continue to blur. Beowulf is a stunning-looking production, and is worth seeing in a 3D venue if possible, with some substance beneath the surface, although it is not quite up to Zemeckis' other works. If you are looking for a film that stimulates the senses, Beowulf is it.",7,1,5,23 November 2007
X2: X-Men United," X2 a sequel worth watching
","After the box-office success of X-Men in 2000, revitalizing the comic book film genre that had fallen on hard times after Batman & Robin successfully chased audiences away, it was inevitable that the X-Men would return in a sequel, and that is precisely what happened with 2003's X2. Director Bryan Singer was back on board, supported by many of the key creatives that ushered X-Men to the screen, and in the process crafted a sequel that was stronger than the original.X2 opens some time after the conclusion of X-Men, with Magneto (Ian McKellan) held in a plastic prison after attempting to mutate the world leaders on Ellis Island, and things back to semi-normal at the Xavier School for Gifted Children. But things don't last that way for long: there is an attempt on the life of the President of the United States by a mutant, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) which gives General William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military official running a special mutant research and development wing of the military, license to crack down on mutants, including raiding the Xavier School.Meanwhile, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), has gone searching for some answers to questions about his past, but found very little. Returning to the fold of the X-Men, he goes on the run with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) when Stryker attacks. Stryker kidnaps Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and plans to use his telepathic abilities to destroy all mutants across the globe. Into this fray, Magneto, aided by his shapeshifting associate Mystique (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos), escapes, meets up with the still free X-Men and the two groups plan to join forces to assault Stryker's base and stop him from carrying out his plan.X2 takes most of what was good about X-Men and serves it up again in a much better package. X2 has a noticeably bigger budget, and while impressive special effects are rarely the sole reason to see a movie, when the film calls for it, they help immeasurably. Still, as with X-Men, Singer and company know when to hold back, and X2 is not ruled by it's visuals. Again, the material at the film's heart takes center stage, and this time the combination proves much more compelling.Essentially, X2 naturally steps up the first film, pushing the plight of the X-Men to the next level and further developing the obvious rift that exists between normal humans and mutants. The film is helped by the introduction of Stryker, a good villain who, while certainly appropriately evil, isn't without his shades of grey. He is a man driven by some dark demons, and while the lengths he goes to are extreme, they are not without some basis in the character's development.X2 once again falls a little short in one area: character management. The X-Men are a group of characters that have been around a long time and there are so many that it becomes difficult to introduce new ones and not begin overcrowding the film. Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter manage to balance it most of the time, but still you can't help feeling that some of the X-Men are coming up short on screen time and development, robbing the film of some of it's emotional power. When the characters are borderline strangers to you, it is difficult to really feel something for their plight.One strong point about X2 that improves over the original is the music score. John Ottman's entry is much more memorable and energetic than Michael Kamen's good, but at times restrained score for the first film. The actors are all in good form, with Hugh Jackman proving to be perfect casting again as curmudgeonly loner Wolverine, and Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart always bring touches of class to the material. Brian Cox is good as the maniacal Stryker and Alan Cumming proves memorable as Nightcrawler.So, X2 proves to be that rarest of beasts: a sequel that is actually better than it's original. X-Men was a proving ground that led the creators to push the boundaries on the sequel and make appropriate improvements when necessary. It's too bad all filmmakers didn't follow their example.",8,1,1,5 June 2006
The Matrix," The Matrix, unparalleled
","When it first premiered in the spring of 1999, I believe few individuals could predict the impact that The Matrix would have, not just on cinema, but on pop culture in general. What began as a modestly budgeted action-science fiction film starring an actor with little thespian acclaim quickly became a touchstone for the popular zeitgeist, and arguably cut into the popularity and impact of the soon to be released Star Wars Episode I. Time has not been kind to the franchise that was The Matrix: the two back to back produced sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, were met with critical derision and public indifference, especially Revolutions, which did not live up to the box-office success of Reloaded. However, looking back at the original film, it's easy to be reminded of why The Matrix was such a hit in the first place.For those unaware of the basics, The Matrix focuses on Thomas Anderson, aka Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker who is searching out a fellow hacker, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), whom Neo believes will give him answers to several questions he is holding, most specifically the question 'What is The Matrix?' Neo eventually meets Morpheus through an associate of his, Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss), and Neo is finally told what he may not have truly been ready to hear: The Matrix is an interactive software program that the entire human population is connected to and through which they appear to live out normal lives. In reality, humans are connected to a giant power plant and are held here by a race of sentient machines that have conquered the world and use humans as a power source. To keep them under control, they are attached to The Matrix, but some humans have managed to break free from the machine's control and are now building a resistance, with the eventual intention of destroying the machines and the Matrix and freeing all humans from bondage. Morpheus believes that one of the keys to accomplishing this goal is Neo, whom he believes is 'The One', an individual with the power to control and reshape the Matrix at will, and who will lead the humans to victory.To be completely honest, much of the Matrix is not tremendously new. Many elements are lifted from countless science-fiction novels and stories, and the film's writers-directors, The Wachowski Brothers, Larry and Andy, were unabashed in their love of particular types of cinema that they liberally ape here: martial arts and action movies, as well as a hint of Japanese Anime. However, as a package deal, The Matrix works stunningly well. While those who have read science fiction, or are fans of the genres of film that the Wachowski Brothers used as their inspiration for The Matrix, may be able to recognize some aspects of the film, most viewers of mainstream cinema would not have seen most of the components in The Matrix, therefore making it a unique experience. Even for those that can pick out the source elements, The Matrix is an entertaining blend of much of the familiar in fresh packaging. It's difficult to remember now, with all the knockoffs and 'homages' in the years since, what a new look and feel The Matrix had at the time. The fetishistic use of black leather costumes, the impressive martial-arts sequences, the elaborate visual effects, most specifically the 'bullet-time' super-slow-motion shots and the film's rather understated religious undertones were not worn out and overused by countless other films picking at The Matrix's bones. Everything here was new to the mass audience, and that alone could account for a large chunk of the film's success.Now, with the hindsight of seeing the two sequels, it's easy to see what a pared-down film The Matrix truly was. While it is obvious that the film has to take time to set up it's characters and situations, it is a very fast paced film, with very little fat on it. The Matrix glides along, never overstaying it's welcome in a particular scene and sequence. Many accused Reloaded of being a overstuffed film, but none of that is in The Matrix.One of the film's greatest strengths is it's character development. Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are not the most fleshed out characters in film history, but at the same time, they are not shallow. Each is developed enough to give us some insight into them, becoming individuals that we come to be invested in. Neo especially, being the focus of the film, is given the most screen time, and he acts as a surrogate for the audience, taking us slowly into the world of the film, allowing the new environs and situations to unfold in a natural, unforced way.Visually, The Matrix is stunning. It's production design and visual effects are both noteworthy (the film won the Academy Award for best visual effects for that year), with the ever popular 'bullet-time' sequences, as mentioned previously, being the standout. The Matrix also benefits from the decision made by the filmmakers to have the main actors train to perform most of the fighting sequences themselves, giving them all the more verisimilitude, as opposed to stunt doubles.Despite the bad taste left in many viewers and fans mouths by the two sequels, The Matrix is still a powerful and memorable piece of film that is as influential and pivotal as the Star Wars franchise, and deserves it's place in history.",9,16,32,27 March 2006
Fantastic Four," Not quite Fantastic
","After several stellar comic book adaptations from Marvel Comics stock of superhero superstars (X-Men, Spider-Man), we are finally, unfortunately, treated to a mediocre entry for one of their A-List, Fantastic Four. The big-budget adaptation of Fantastic Four is lackluster at best, proving to be a slightly diverting, but not tremendously entertaining, adventure.As with most other comic book adaptations, we are treated to an 'origin' story for the Fantastic Four. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud), a brilliant but bankrupt scientist, along with his friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), have approached rich industrialist Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, of Nip/Tuck fame) to fund an expedition to his private space station to perform research on a cosmic radiation cloud that might prove to reveal some information about human evolution. Von Doom agrees, although he demands that he keep most of the profit from any financial gains that the mission might hold. He brings along his assistant, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), a former love interest of Reed's, and her brother, hothead Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), who is the mission pilot. Shortly after arriving at the space station, it turns out that the calculations about the storm's trajectory are off, and it arrives earlier than planned, bathing the crew in radiation.Upon returning from space everyone appears to be unaffected at first, but shortly thereafter, they begin exhibiting some strange symptoms, and each quickly discovers they have been granted a unique ability from the storm. Reed can stretch his body like a rubber band, Sue can become invisible, Johnny can immolate himself and fly and Ben transforms into a giant made of rock. Von Doom, who was protected behind his station's shields, doesn't seem to have been affected at all, but his symptoms simply take longer to manifest, and he quickly realizes that his body is transforming into an organic metal that can store electricity and then return it in the form of lightning bolts. Reed determines that he must try to reverse the storm's effect on them, but not before the world is introduced to their existence thanks to an happenstance traffic accident that they are able to help out with. Thanks to this exposure, the group become media celebrities overnight and are dubbed the Fantastic Four by reporters, although some of the group meets this newfound fame with trepidation.If Fantastic Four has a key problem, it is that the members of it's group are woefully underdeveloped. Much like X-Men and X2, there are almost too many characters to adequately juggle for a two hour movie. As such, most of the group gets short-shrift. Reed comes across as a shy, socially inept geek, but we don't see much beyond that superficial exterior. Sue Storm is developed even less, she is memorable only because Jessica Alba is easy on the eyes. Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, on the other hand, make something of an impression, even though they are also not completely fleshed out. Johnny is entertaining in a juvenile, annoying sidekick kind of way, and he provides a great deal of the film's comic relief. Ben has the most interesting plight of the four, shunned by his girlfriend because of his looks and having to deal with the most difficulty with his body (elevators won't rise, chairs and silverware break when he sits). The screenplay develops Ben best of the group. Finally, Von Doom turns out to be a bland, uninteresting villain, who is evil simply because he is narcissistic. That is a good start for a bad guy, but there is not enough meat on the bones to create much dislike for him.Aside from underdevelopment, Fantastic Four suffers from a rather limp script. The film just sort of meanders its way along, never developing much excitement or interest. For anyone looking for action, this is not the film to see. While hardly a requisite for a good movie, action scenes are well used in both Spider-Man and X-Men, but are rather wanting here. The visual effects are a mixed bag also, most being impressive, but some at times some come across cheesy and unconvincing.Acting-wise, nobody embarrasses themselves in the film, but there is little that is outstanding either. Chiklis turns in the best performance as Ben Grimm, giving the character the appropriate amount of pathos. Chris Evans is also effective as Johnny Storm. Sue and Reed are about as bland as bland come, adding little to the mix. Julian McMahon is underwhelming as Victor Von Doom, proving to not be a memorable entry in Marvel's rogues gallery of villains.In many ways, Fantastic Four is the antithesis of X-Men. Where the X-Men is an allegory for racial bigotry and the X-Men are viewed with fear, Fantastic Four are in the center of the spotlight because of their abilities. There are some interesting ideas that could be introduced with this concept, but the script doesn't do much with it, although it is nice to see the outside world react to the discovery of these unique individuals in a way that seems to be realistic for our current day and age.Overall, Fantastic Four is a very weak link in the Marvel film chain. We can only hope that the next entries for X-Men and Spider-Man don't follow suit.",6,2,4,11 July 2005
Sin City," Revel in 'Sin'
","There are few comic book adaptations that are as faithful to the source material as Sin City. Most comic adaptations make some kind of obligatory change for reasons that range from good to nonsensical, leaving fans of the original graphic novel bemoaning the desecration of their beloved comic. Not with Sin City. Advertised by director Robert Rodriguez as a 'translation,' Sin City replicates its inspiration impeccably, right down to individual shots matching individual panels of the original comic. But aside from slavish attention to detail, Sin City is an enormously entertaining film in its own right, recapturing some of the magic that made Pulp Fiction a runaway success.Sin City is based on a series of graphic novels written and illustrated by Frank Miller, a comic creator most famous for his hard-edged take on Batman in the late 1980's with the graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns. Here, Miller has drawn on an apparent love of pulpy, hard-boiled detective and crook stories right out of the 1940's. His leads are all anti-heroes to one degree or another, his women are hookers or bar maids, the police are crooked, and violence surrounds everyone in abundance.Sin City is essentially three separate stories: the first introduces us to Marv (Mickey Rourke), an ex-con with an ugly mug who gets picked up by a hooker named Goldie (Jamie King), but when Marv wakes up the next day, Goldie is dead, and Marv has been framed for the murder. So, instead of just taking it, he goes on a warpath to find the truth about Goldie's killer and lets no one stand in his way. The second story focuses on Dwight (Clive Owen), a murderer who just obtained plastic surgery to change his face. He is witness to a bar girl's boyfriend, James Rafferty (Benecio Del Toro), roughing her up and decides to take matters into his own hands. But before he can do anything, James and his crew ride into a section of the city dubbed Old Town, where the prostitutes have license to protect themselves, by any means necessary. The last story revolves around a police detective, Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who saves a little girl named Nancy from the clutches of a sadistic serial child rapist (Nick Stahl), only to end up framed for the crimes as revenge by the father of the rapist, a powerful senator (Powers Boothe). Eight years later, fearing for Nancy's safety, Hartigan manages to get released from prison and goes searching for Nancy (Jessica Alba), unaware that he is being followed by someone from his past.On the visual front, Sin City is a knockout. Rodriguez, who has begun to rely more and more on advancing digital technology to craft his films, filmed most of his performers in front of greenscreens with limited props and sets and combined them with digitally rendered backgrounds. For the most part, it works beautifully. As with Miller's graphic novels, the color palate is mostly black and white, with a little color utilized, often to represent story points, or sometimes to make an emotional impact. The computer generated backgrounds are exceptional, creating a seedy, non-time-specific world of dirt, grime and dampness. By utilizing this technique, the style of the film stays relatively intact, with no jarring change from real set to digital at any point in the film. Rodriguez also frames many of his shots to one-for-one match Miller's original panels. For those not familiar with the Sin City graphic novels, this attention to detail will not be recognized, but for anyone who knows the source material, it is one extra touch that helps elevate Sin City above much of it's comic adaptation brethren.Sin City lives up to its pulp roots at every turn, especially in its dialogue. At first, the film's hard boiled, very pulp-style dialogue seems jarring, unrealistic and stilted. But after a few minutes, that feeling dissipates and the dialogue flows naturally at that point. Rodriguez also does a good job of intertwining humor into the film. This is a picture that doesn't take itself too seriously, but also doesn't descend into camp.The characters are mostly engaging, especially Marv. If there is any example of career resuscitation at its best, then Mickey Rourke's performance as Marv would be it. Rourke has been generally unimpressive to me for his last ten or so films, but he is a standout in Sin City. He breathes live into Marv and manages to make us care about this rather simple minded thug, finding pathos in the character. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen as the other male leads are both notable also, but they don't quite match the memorable Marv.The one caveat to make about Sin City is that this is definitely not a film for everyone. It's laced wall-to-wall with graphic violence and some rather frank and explicit nudity (although never dipping towards pornography). Many people will be repulsed by its no-holds-barred attitude, but for those who enjoy this type of material, Sin City does not disappoint.",9,0,1,20 April 2005
V for Vendetta," Claim your Vendetta
","In the world of comic books, many in the know believe that Alan Moore is the finest comics scribe to have graced many a paneled page, and I cannot argue with them. Responsible for some of the finest comic stories I have ever read, including the seminal series Watchmen, Moore has never been treated extremely well in big screen adaptations of his material. The attempts to date have included From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, neither of which were disasters, but hardly shining examples of great movies. Now, with V for Vendetta, Moore's source material has finally been given the cinematic respect it deserves.V for Vendetta comes from the Wachowski Brothers of Matrix fame, although this time they are just writers-producers, turning over directorial reins to their longtime First Assistant Director James McTeigue, who makes his feature debut with V for Vendetta. Those expecting anything in the Matrix vein will be disappointed, because this is not a film about kung fu fighting and virtual worlds, it is a film about ideas and principals, with some controversial material at it's heart.The film opens in 2019 London, where the world has changed. America is a cesspool of disease and England has become a totalitarian state under the iron-fisted rule of Supreme Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). He runs a ruthless propaganda machine that provides nightly broadcasts from a media mouthpiece known as the 'Voice of England', Lewis Prothero (Roger Allam), telling the nation what to think. Nightly curfews are in place, and it is after the curfew for the evening has gone into effect that British Television Network employee Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) has gone out to meet a friend. She is assaulted by government agents and rescued by a man dressed in a cloak and donning a Guy Fawkes mask, who goes by the name V (Hugo Weaving). V is out to destroy the London landmark the Old Bailey, accompanied by fireworks and the 1812 Overture over the city's loudspeakers.After V's first act of terrorism, he issues an offer to England's populous: stand with him at the gates of parliament in one year's time to resist the government and take back their freedom. Meanwhile, video camera's that recorded V's first act has singled out Evey, so the police are attempting to find her, and V takes her into his protective custody, but she is uncertain if V is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. V is also in the process of murdering several key member's of England's ruling party, putting police detective Finch (Stephen Rea) on his tail, but he quickly begins to discover more than he bargained for.V for Vendetta has at it's center a question that is arguably of more relevance today than when the original multi-issue mini-series was published in the 1980's: is terrorism always unjustified? Or is it sometimes a label used by those in power to stop the efforts of those attempting to undermine an oppressive regime. While the film is set in England, the issues at V for Vendetta's core are very relevant to Americans, going as far back as the American Revolution, and the events of 9/11 can't be ignored for recent volleys for this issue.While not an action film per se, V for Vendetta has a few decent action set pieces that are well staged, but they are not the film's thrust. V integrates material as diverse as Hitler's Nazi regime, featuring swastika like symbols, jack boots, intolerance of racial, and sexual, differences; the infamous George Orwell novel 1984, with it's relentless pro-state propaganda and large images of the head of it's leader consuming television screens; and finally, film noir detective stories. It is this last aspect that doesn't really work well. At times the film's scenes involving the investigation of the murder of prominent members of the society is almost the central focus, but are quickly ushered off and the connection to the remainder of the plot seems at time tenuous; you know it's important, but the screenplay doesn't quite weave the material into the other aspects of the film's story.The film's performances are mostly adequate, but there isn't really a standout. Natalie Portman, top billed, fills the role of Evey well, but is just good enough, not outstanding. The most memorable performance is actually Hugo Weaving's vocal work as V. The character never appears without his mask, so we never get a view of his face. The role was originally filled by British thespian James Purefoy, but he left over 'creative differences' and Weaving took over the role, and since the actor's face is never seen, what remains on screen physically is a mixture of Purefoy, Weaving and a stuntman. However, the voice is all Weaving, and he deliver's V's often colorful lines effectively, making an impression without having to even view his countenance.Overall, V for Vendetta is an entertaining and often thought-provoking experience, almost sure to cause debate in some corners, and rightfully so. The issues it raises are not easy ones, and many will undoubtedly be offended by some of the film's material. But, without debate, there is no greater understanding, and V for Vendetta entertains while engaging. What a fresh breath of aid that can be.",8,3,4,2 June 2006
The Island," A sufficient Island
","In some respects, The Island is something of a departure for director Michael Bay from the usual. Oh, there is no doubt that this film comes from the same individual who gave us The Rock and Armageddon; it's full of the same high-octane, fast-paced action, but it also shows that Bay can indulge the more intellectual side of the medium, although apparently only to a point.The Island is a thriller that is part sci-fi, part action film, and it uses the ethics and practice of cloning as it's basis. This isn't a new idea, there have been several other films that have addressed cloning before, at it also isn't a new concept to meld action with cloning, that was already done in The 6th Day. But the package as assembled is reasonably entertaining and holds your attention for it's running time.The film focuses on a character named Lincoln Echo Six (Ewan McGregor), who lives in a massive multistory facility with many other individuals. They are all led to believe they are survivors of a great environmental holocaust that has rendered the world incapable of supporting life. The only remaining 'pathogen-free' zone is called The Island, and the survivors are given a random opportunity to be sent to the Island through a regular lottery. The inhabitants of this contained world are monitored for health and nutrition and given various menial tasks to accomplish. Lincoln has developed a friendship with another member of the society, named Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannson), who wins the lottery to go to the island. After discovering an insect in the service areas of the plant, Lincoln explores further and discovers that their existence is actually a fraud. There is no Island, Lincoln and the others are clones of rich, powerful individuals in the outside world. There is no contamination, and the clones exist to provide replacement organs and other items to the clients who ordered them and can afford the hefty price tag. With the desire to save his own existence and that of his best friend, Lincoln escapes from the facility, with Jordan in tow, and meets up with a technician he had befriended at the facility (Steve Buscemi) who sets them in direction of their 'sponsors' to try and reveal the truth to the world. Meanwhile, the facility owner, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), desperate to ensure the truth is not revealed to the world, hires a freelance hit team to bring back his 'products,' led by a man named Albert (Djimon Hounsou).The basic quandary that the Island focuses on, the ethics of cloning, is an interesting one to explore, and The Island does raise some questions concerning the moral dilemmas of the possibility of using clones as a source of 'spare parts' for humans, but much like 1990's Total Recall, aside from introducing the issue, it doesn't quite take the material to a higher ground. We don't see the repercussions that might evolve out of the populous discovering that the rich and powerful have paid for living humans to be created and then eventually slaughtered so that the originals can go on living. After introducing the premise the film swings into full on action mode, featuring several chases, shoot-outs and fight sequences. The action sequences are well staged, and more than a little engaging, so from the point-of-view of serving as an entertaining action vehicle, The Island does it's job well, but those looking for a little more meat to the moral quandaries introduced will walk away feeling short-changed.As with all of Bay's films, The Island has a very slick look, with gorgeous production design by Nigel Phelps and very atmospheric cinematography by Mauro Fiore. The film also features Michael Bay's trademark: fast-paced, breakneck-speed editing. I enjoy a good action sequence as much as the next man, but do all of his have to edited as if by a spastic child? Bay does keep it a little more on the ground than some of his previous turns; it's not quite as overdone as, say, Armageddon, but it is still a bit much for my taste.On the acting front, most of the performers are capable, turning in effective performances, but no one is pushing their limit. Ewan McGregor has some fun scenes playing both Lincoln and his 'sponsor' opposite each other, differentiated by the accents in their voice, but its nothing that hasn't been seen in some form before. Sean Bean does his best snarling as the villain, but he keeps it from going over the top.The Island is that sort of middle-ground movie that is featured most every summer: intriguing idea not fully fleshed out, blended with heavy action to fulfill what is believed to be what the audience wants. It is effective at what it does, you just wish it did a little more.",7,0,2,8 August 2005
