Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well worth seeing, but there is room for improvement
","I'm going to ignore the nay-sayers and rabid fans both for this review and tell you, yes, this is indeed a movie worth seeing.  In describing what's good about it, well, it's hard to do so without simply copying other reviews.The special effects are impressive, not so much for their flashiness and so-on.  You CAN achieve that without CG and the like.  The thing I liked was that this was the first time I've seen such consistent use of CG that doesn't advertise itself as such.  The fact that such work was put into this movie for the sole purpose of hiding the tell-tale  markers of CG was impressive.  Other, previous movies have made use of the new effects technology, but there was always little signs; like the black border around such characters and the like that you simply couldn't ignore them.  SWE1 melded real-life and computer generated life wonderfully.Aside from the effects, the movie had other merits, McGregor has done a bang-up job capturing the essense of Guinness' Kenobi while providing a glimpse of that same character as a head-strong apprentice Jedi.  We can see the Obi-Wan to be in Ewan's acting.  The other characters are portrayed well, even young Anakin although as an old Star Wars fan it's difficult to see the Vader to be, but there's time and two episodes to go.  Darth Maul's battle scenes were truly awe-inspiring bringing a real sense of battle that was slightly lacking in IV-VI.Otherwise, Maul was disappointing.  Previews, trailers, and yes, hype made Maul out to be a larger villain than he turned out to be.  He ended up little more than a henchman and not much of a menace (although I suspect the movie's name sake was meant to be Palpatine more than Maul). Nevertheless, Darth Maul hardly seemed worthy of the Darth title.As for other points, the movie is fun, but you can definitely see the influence of parenthood on Lucas in this episode.  George admitted this movie would be geared more towards children this time and such intent is understandable considering his own children.  However, I think he underestimated the intelligence of today's children, unless he was aiming for the pre-school bunch.  The Gungan's simply couldn't be taken seriously at all with Jar-Jar's annoyingly cute bumbling and the incessant mugging of the Gungan leader.  Humour in the previous movies was subtle, but hardly out of the grasp of even children in their first decade.  TPM seemed to rely more on obvious physical comedy that just looked out of place in the Star Wars universe.If the last paragraphs made you think I didn't like SWE1:TPM, sorry, I enjoyed it a lot although I'm somewhat biased being a fan from my first big screen experience when A New Hope was simply Star Wars.  Hopefully though, Lucas listens to the fans when he puts together the next two movies. Ignore the 'professional' critics.  Any criticism from them is simply a few sad sacks hedging their bets in case this movie doesn't do well so they can say 'I told you so.'  Reviews like the ones found here on IMDB are from the real people who actually shelled out their own hard earned cash and Lucas has claimed that's who he's interested in.I still have hope for the two episodes to come.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Rude, crude, and hilarious
","First off, for anyone who's not a fan of South Park the TV series because of it's profanity, irreverence, etc.; don't bother going to see it because this movie is South Park on steroids and you'll likely be moved to write inflammatory reviews condemning the movie and anyone who enjoys 'potty' humour.However, if you're a fan of the boys I'm sure you'll get a kick out of 'Bigger, ...'  The movie's plot is simple and reminiscent of an early episode where the parents of South Park take on the cable network that shows Terrence and Phillip for the constant fart jokes in the 'Canadian' comedy.This time, Terrence and Phillip put out a movie where they pull all the stops in showing profanity and even more fart jokes (Hmm, familiar?).  The kids go see the movie and begin cursing and farting and once again, led by Kyle's mom, the South Park parents are on a rampage.  This time they wage war on Canada itself, the home of Terrence and Phillip.Beyond this point the movie slips back to its standard of irreverence and crudeness.  On the face of it, there's nothing particularly redeeming about this movie, but I still laughed 'til I had tears in my eyes.Parker and Stone have tried to pull this movie off as something of a musical, but this sure  ain't no Gilbert and Sullivan score.  With songs like 'Uncle F**ka', and a world spanning rendition of 'Kyle's Mom is a Bitch', you can bet there'll be no Oscar nominations for best musical for this one but you'll still be humming the tunes afterward and no doubt giggling like a maniac from time to time.In the end, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut remains an acquired taste, if you're easily offended, forget it; there's something here to offend just about everyone.  However if you're a fan, I'm sure you'll love it; they've left no politically-incorrect stone unturned.",9,0,0,3 July 1999
The Matrix," What is the Matrix? A terrific movie.
","It may sound like cliche now, but you have to see the Matrix, you cannot be told.  Partly, because of the obvious reason, if you're like me, you hate spoilers and you want to see it for yourself. Partly, because although it's in a way a simple enough concept, it has to be seen to be really understood.That said, let's get to the meat.  If for no other reason than to see some great visual effects, this movie is well worth seeing.  The effects are wonderful and innovative without becoming a 'look what we did with CGI' movie.  The sound is also great, well worth looking for a Dolby Digital theatre to see it.  This is one that will likely be snapped up quickly once it's out on DVD by people who want to showcase their 5.1 systems.As for the story, as I said, it's a simple yet intriguing concept of the future.  There were a couple minor plot holes, but nothing you can't overlook.  I won't go into what it's all about since I'm sure you've either heard it all before or want to see it for yourself.  Rest assured though, it's good.Character wise, the movie holds its own.  I've yet to be disappointed by anything Laurence Fishburne has done and he certainly doesn't disappoint here as the enigmatic resistance leader Morpheus.Personally, I'm not one for Keanu Reaves bashing, he has become somewhat typecast as the brooding, strong-silent type and he pretty much sticks to that character here.  I know, everyone's thinking about Johnny Mnemonic (Moronic), frankly, the suckage factor of that movie cannot be entirely laid on Keanu's lap.  They could have put anyone in that role and the movie would have still out-sucked Electrolux.The supporting cast supports well, even though the only characters you really get to know to any degree are Neo (Reaves), Morpheus, and Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss).It's hard to really critique this movie further without lapsing into spoilers and cliche, so I'll leave it at this;  The Matrix is an entertaining two hours and well worth the price of admission.",10,0,0,3 April 1999
