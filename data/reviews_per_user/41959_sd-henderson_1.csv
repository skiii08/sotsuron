Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful Follow-Up to Blade Runner
","Wow. This is a beautiful film. I'll be honest, I am still processing it, having just watched it last night.
As a huge fan of the original, in my humble opinion, Denis Villeneuve showed tremendous restraint in not turning the sequel into a messy, over the top, action-packed version of the original. Instead, it is likely the most aesthetically pleasing films you will have seen in a long long time, as well as a complex meditation on what it means to be human. Again, I am still processing BR2049, as I should be. The themes touched upon in the film are worthy of contemplation. It is a long film to be sure, but I was willing to put in the work, so no complaints from me there. Frankly, the film could have last 5 hours and I still would have watched it.",9,2,9,25 April 2018
