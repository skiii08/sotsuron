Men in Black 3," Nothing but pure genius.
","I love the first 2 films. This one? Genius. I love everything about it. I think the chemistry between Will Smith & Josh Brolin is on point and it makes the movie and as always Tommy Lee Jones just swings it out of the ball park.
I loved getting a bit of history about K.I could watch this movie over and over and I have.
A classic.",10,1,1,15 September 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Not just any war movie.
","I think sometimes critics use their big words to distract you into thinking what they think about a movie. And unfortunately Hacksaw Ridge has a few of those critics around. Not only is this movie beautifully written and directed but the all actors talent is A+ and I can't fault it.
It's real and it's gore but war is real and these men fought the hard fight and it frustrates me when critics sit behind their computers and tear movies like this apart. This movie has the stomach to pack a punch to the audience and it's one of the few war movies that really leaves you speachless at the end. Mel Gibson has done an amazing job and we are so lucky to be able to see what the men and women went through for us.",10,1,1,30 April 2018
