50 First Dates," A Sandler movie for romantics
","This movie started out like a typical Sandler comedy, and gradually gain momentum as a heartfelt romantic comedy. Despite some crudeness and idiotic jokes in the beginning, I would say that overall this was a love story, not a typical Sandler comedy. The acting by Sandler was both funny and touching, even the scene in which he was the typical 'Sandler' in his slapstick comedies.The story was well-written overall and I was truly touched by his love for her. The ending of this movie was as beautiful an ending as I've ever seen in a movie. People who are romantics will truly enjoy this movie as much as me and my wife did.",8,0,0,16 August 2004
