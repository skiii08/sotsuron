It," A fresh take on a movie who's genre is over saturated with cliché scares and awful plots.
","It's very good. As I watched this movie I obviously tried comparing it to the original IT film. I was both surprised and shocked by the similarities and differences between the two films. Is it scary? Yes and no. This isn't your run of the mill cliché horror movie filled with constant jump scares and a predictable plot. This movie is what I would consider a very well done reboot of an older movie. The characters in this film were expertly picked and perfectly played and portrayed. The reason I gave this movie a 4 and a half out of five stars is because its not very scary at all. That's not to say it wasn't suspenseful. it was filled with tension and suspense. There were very few jump scares but it is still scary. Another reason I am giving it 4 and a half out of five stars is because the movie will be split into 2 parts. the original IT movie was almost 3 hours if I can remember correctly. The movie covered the story of Pennywise the clown terrorizing the town of Derry when the characters were both children and adults. The new IT movie covers only the events that occurred during the lives of the characters when they were children. Now granted, the new film is absolutely terrific, but I am a little nervous to see how they will do the sequel to the newest IT film. I hope they don't drag it out and fill it with reboot/sequel crap. Overall, IT (2017) is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend it. 4.5/5 stars. Must Watch!",9,2,3,27 September 2017
