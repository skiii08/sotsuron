Skyfall," Classic Bond is Back!
","I won't say I loved this film, but I definitely liked it. As usual Daniel Craig's Bond is spot on. He makes Bond somehow more real than previous actors.Skyfall has a purpose, and that purpose is to bring back the classic Bond. You are finally introduced to the new 'Q' and 'Moneypenny'. Bond exclusively uses a Walther PPK as his weapon. He drives the old Aston Martin he won in Casino Royal, only now it has machine-guns behind the headlights.(sound familiar?) This is definitely homage to all the other films, and is perfect for the 50th anniversary. Skyfall is filled with innuendo and references to the Connery days which adds a certain whimsy to the movie. It has action, humor, drama, and charm galore. A perfect 007 movie. If you are a Bond fan, this movie is a must see. If you are not a fan you might want to wait till it hits DVD.",Null,8,18,10 November 2012
Prometheus," No Science in this Sci-Fi
","Yesterday I watched the film 'Prometheus' and was so moved by it, I felt I had to share it with everyone. This movie is total garbage. Do not pay to see this film. If you are a science fiction fan you will be tempted to walk out within 45 minutes. The whole thing lacks plot. The acting is hard to judge because the script is so ridiculous. And finally there was extremely very little science in this science-fiction movie.The main so- called plot of this film is clearly stated in the previews, but beyond that, there is no continuity. The idea is that all life on earth originated from an ancient, advanced, humanoid, alien life form with the goal of evolving into copies of themThere are obvious holes in this theory. Evolution is based on random biological mutations. The environment dictates the evolution of DNA. DNA is more like a record of where an organism has been, not where they are going. So these aliens created us in the beginning, and you get to actually see that moment within the first couple of minutes of the film. However you see the same exact humanoid aliens at the end of the film. Why haven't they evolved further? You'd think there would be some changes to their appearance in 3.5 billion years! Apparently there is an apex of evolution and once you reach their level there is nothing moreNot believable in the slightest.Once the movie explains the basic plot you are now forced to believe that within a matter of a few years a trillion dollar space exploration mission is put together and on its way to a foreign planet, which by the way is only two years away. The closest solar system to ours is, Alpha Centauri, which is 4.7 light years away. That means you would have to travel the speed of light, for 4.7 years to get there. They did not travel the speed of light and only had a seemingly conventional propulsion system. The best they could hope for was mars. The ship was ridiculous. No attention was paid to scientific accuracy, or scale for that matter. It is supposed to be a scientific exploration vessel, why does it have a basketball court? The lab is extremely small and seemed very ill equipped. They had plenty of booze on board, but very little medical equipment. Except for a miracle machine, that can do surgery, but only on men. The supervisor of the trip has a huge extravagant suite complete with the largest TV you will ever see, wet bar and tons of swanky furniture. I am surprised there wasn't a fireplace and bear skin rug. All the crew members have small private quarters with their own bathroom and vanity. It also has a huge cargo hold that carries tons of vehicles (one the size of a short bus), and flame throwers. During the pan out shots of the ship it can be estimated at no more than 100 meters in length. The real life space shuttle is 40 meters long! There is no way you could fit all that junk in that tiny space craft. They clearly did not build an actual ship set. You never see the crew walk through the ship from one end to the other, this is to hide the true scale. Once the crew wakes up from their 2 year hyper sleep they regain all there strength within minutes and are really hungry. LOL. Then they take their positions on the ship and immediately find an alien structure. No searching or orbiting. Bam they find it just like that. Lucky I guess Everyone suites up in there very stylish space suits and just walks right into the structure. No hesitation. One of the crew members is an android named David. Why didn't they have more androids to do their dirty work? Why didn't they just send a bunch of androids in first to check it out? He is very smart but totally unpredictable. He touches everything and contaminates everything.That is very annoying, when you are trying to explore a potentially dangerous site. Characters in this film have no substance and really no logic. One minute they are screaming around hysterical about a spooky hallway and the next they are trying to pet an alien cobra, calm as can be. The characters also do every cliché B movie thing they can. Take off there helmet to find out if the air is OK, start pushing buttons to find out what they do the list goes on. The main character is a total enigma. Her boyfriend,who later impregnates her with a squid, has four lines in the whole movie. He is a totally forgettable character. They all are forgettable. You are kind of happy when each one dies because it's one less annoying character and you know it's one step closer to the end.There are no explanations about the aliens, or the squid baby or the black goo you see everywhere. You are just guessing what everything means. I suppose this is just a cheap ploy to get you to come back and see 'Prometheus 2'. I can only image the garbage that would be. At the very end you are graced with the appearance of a traditional alien. It makes you laugh. Not scary at all and everyone is either already dead or safe.The only positive thing about this movie is the design. Everything looks pretty cool and it's even kind of fun to see all the design elements that went into it. It's not worth a movie ticket though. Bottom line- This movie is bad, really bad. Every second of this movie is implausible, laughable and totally ridiculous. Do not give 20th Century Fox, or Ridley Scott a single penny more for this film!",2,6,11,9 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Best Picture!
","First off, do not believe any of the reviews that give this film less than a 5. I am pretty sure these people are either on drugs or are writing bad reviews just to get people going. This is a perfect end to a perfect superhero trilogy. Christopher Nolan has created an entirely unique batman universe and that gave him a lot of artistic freedom. Sure there were a lot of differences in this movie from the comics and other films. All of the Chris Nolan's Batman movies had these differences. The Important thing to remember is that he wanted to portray a more realistic and gritty version of Batman. I am glad that he sufficiently ended the trilogy in such a way that somebody else will not be able to come along and ruin it with a batman 4, like they did to the previous versions. Those movies just got worse and worse with every sequel. Chris Nolan Changes that I Loved:*Bane didn't use venom to get buff- I always thought the whole steroid thing was really lame, this new Bane was way more evil and intellectual.*Robin was not a trapeze artist- Seems to make more sense than the 'boy wonder' homo-erotic storyline. I also hated the fact that Batman was always a hypocrite to Robin in previous films. *Batman actually gets hurt- You actually see this a lot in the comics but up until now has been left out of the movies. Of course you would be barely able to walk if you took a beating on a regular basis.*Batman Retires/ Bruce Wayne Dies- Bravo Christopher Nolan, for having the guts to bring this to a real ending! *Cat-woman did not use a whip- I always thought that was an unnecessary accessory for a thief. I think they originally added that just for a sexy edge. The special effects were perfect in this movie. I was really hard to tell when they were doing CGI or if it was the real thing. The movie was long but it moved really fast and was packed with action. There was some really good acting, especially Michael Caine (Alfred), and Gary Oldman (Gordon). Bottom line- I loved this movie. Definitely will buy the blue ray when it comes out!",10,5,11,24 July 2012
