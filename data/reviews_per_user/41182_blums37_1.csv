The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Cheapo Hollywood's way of ripping money of you!
","This is one of the movies that I regret watching it and waisting my time. Can't agree on one person who thinks this movie was great, because NOTHING happens in that movie and then it ends on a unfinished note.The story about children killing children is a pretty sadistic theme, but the first two movies make up for it! but now that is see that their ripping money off you I think thats wrong I mean it actually should be called the 'The Hungergames part 1 of part 3' NOW DO YOU SEE IT?If anyone is reading this before watching! DO THAT, WATCH IT! But remember - this part didn't have anything important so you can just wait this out and just start from the next movie",1,35,52,6 December 2014
