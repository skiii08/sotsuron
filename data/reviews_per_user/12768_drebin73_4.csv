Walk the Line," the best movie I've seen in a while.
","Walk the Line covers the story of the late great Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Johnny Cash is one of the greatest musicians in music history and this is a well done tribute to his work. Joquin Pheonix is Johnny Cash and is a very good one at that. Pheonix had learned how to play guitar for the role and he also supplies the very convincing singing voice for Cash. Reese Witherspoon is June Carter in an award worthy performance.Witherspoon provides the singing voice for June carter as well. This movie is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. It has great music, great story, great editing, great directing and great performances from everyone in the movie. The movie shows how cash toured with June Carter, Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presly. The movie basically covers the story of Johnny and June and how they came to be and the Folsom Prison album. This movie needs to be seen by anyone who likes Cash and music in general. 10 out of 10",10,0,0,5 March 2006
Gone with the Wind," Great Movie
",I got this movie from someone else. There would be no way that 'I' would buy Gone with the Wind. There was no way that I was going to watch literally four hours of a full blown romance movie. But when I decided to try it out I was very surprised that I was eager to pop in the second part. I was surprised that I was engulfed in a romance story but then I though its not like that at all. This movie is commonly referred to as romance and that is how I viewed it when I started it but I quickly realized that its not a romance movie its a war story. I'm not saying that it is not a romance movie. There is a fair share of romance in the movie but thats not the whole movie. Vivian Leigh is great as Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable is great as Rhett Butler. The movie takes place during the civil war and there are a lot of exciting parts. The whole movie is a triumph and it gets a lot of crap from the younger generation. Everyone should at least give this movie a try. I went in thinking that I was going to hate it but came out surprisingly satisfied. 10 out of 10,10,3,5,25 February 2006
Rear Window," Hitchcocks Best, Cinemas Best
","This is the greatest movie of all time. I believe that Jimmy Stewart is one of the greatest actors ever and that Grace Kelly is one of the best actresses of the era. Rear Window takes place in a small apartment complex in the village. Jimmy Stewart plays famous photographer L. B. 'Jeff' Jefferies who after an accident is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. He has nothing to do but stare out of the window and look at the neighbors. He plays this role very well. When Jeff thinks he has witnessed a murder from the apartment across the way he gets help from his high society girl friend Lisa played by Grace Kelly and his comical nurse Stella played by Thelma Ritter and his detective friend Lt. Doyle played by Wendell Corey. When you carefully watch the movie you can see that there is a great amount of humor throughout the whole film as well as a whole crap-load of suspense. Thelma Ritter is the more obvious comic relief of the film with funny one liners: ' When two people love each other, they come together - WHAM - like two taxis on Broadway. ' One thing that this movie tackles is the subject of voyeurism the act of watching someone without there knowledge and not for sexual gratification. This is what most movies are anyway, we are in a way spying on the people in the movie and become interested in their lives.This movie just focuses on it specifically. One thing that it is interesting is how the camera never leaves Jeff's apartment. We can see conversations between the neighbors but we can not hear what they are saying so we have to figure out what is going on by their body language. The whole movie is a bunch of reaction shots from Stewart. Jeff sees something, then we see him react to it. Another thing in this movie is the relation ship between Jeff and Lisa 'Jeff: She wants me to marry her. Stella: That's normal. Jeff: I don't want to. Stella: That's abnormal.' Jeff feels that her lifestyle would not be the kind that she would want to be apart of seeing that he travels all over the world to photograph things like war and other things of that nature' Raymond Burr stars as the suspected murderer Lars Thorwald. This movie is the greatest movie and I can't do it justice by telling you about it like this. This one just needs to be seen by everybody. 11 out of 10",10,7,13,22 February 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Mrs. Hogwallop up and R-U-N-N-O-F-T.
","Fargo. No. O Brother Where Art thou. Yes. O Brother Where art thou is the Coen Brothers best picture. This movie is filled with great comedy and great music. The movie is based on Homer's The Odyssey. I'd personally would rather watch this adaptation of the book than read the book itself. The movie stars as George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, John Tuturro stars as Pete and Tim Blake Nelson as dim witted Delmar O'Donnell. All of them play escaped convicts looking for the treasure that Everett had buried before going to jail. So when they bust out out of jail it is a whole new adventure waiting for them. When they record a song to get some cash they end up recording a hit song. Everyone is looking for these new found musicians but they are trying to hide from the law. This whole movie is filled with hilarious one liners from Clooney. The move also stars Holly Hunter, Charles Durning and John Goodman as a greedy bible salesman. This movie is a success in in every aspect and it is the Coen brothers greatest film.",10,3,4,24 February 2006
