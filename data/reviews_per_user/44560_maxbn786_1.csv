Requiem for a Dream," Gloom and despair
","Literally the most sad movie i have ever seen. Makes me feel so hopeless that for a moment after watching the movie i might have killed myself if given a chance. The motive is undoubtedly a good one but the sadness of the plot is overwhelming even for the most positive thinkers. I mean life is not always fair or beautiful but still cinema is for entertainment and spreading hope for a brighter future or at least a future in this case. For people who choose to see the empty half of the glass the movie is a piece of art, for those who believe in 'we shall overcome' please stay away from anyone who has to do anything with the movie.",1,3,7,11 November 2012
