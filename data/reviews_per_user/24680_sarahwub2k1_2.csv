United 93," Surreal and Moving
","I wanted to see this film, mainly because of all of the controversy surrounding it. I automatically thought it would have been made to be extremely Hollywood. But I was surprised. This film was probably the most emotionally moving, heart wrenching film I've ever seen. It's very strange because your watching it, and you're thinking, this is a sad film, then the realisation suddenly kicks in that it's not just a film, that what you're watching happened pretty much word for word. The actors/actresses in the film make it so watchable, and I sometimes found myself forgetting that what I was watching wasn't 'documentary' footage from the actual plane. The actions of the people on that plane showed true courage and determination. I'm British, but after watching this film, I would be proud to be an American. If your ready for an emotional true story, then I recommend this film 110%",10,1,4,7 May 2006
The Descent," A surprisingly good film
","Now I'm a sucker for horror/thriller jumpy films. But there are very few that have actually ever made me jump. I went to the cinema to see this thinking it could either be quite good, or extremely bad. I was pleasantly surprised! I was worried at the start of the film that the acting was going to be a bit bad but they really were good. The varying accents became slightly confusing at times as they don't really explain the friends backgrounds at all such as how they met, where they are from etc.But I lost count of the amount of times this film made me jump! The 'crawlers' I thought kind of looked like the orks out of Lord of the Rings! But I was impressed as they could have taken it way too far (aka Jeepers Creepers, man thing with wings! What was that about?!) It really did keep me on the edge of my seat and in parts my mouth fell open in slight shock! I'm sure this film won't be everybody's cup of tea but I really enjoyed it. I think my main tip will be, if you don't like gory images, then this film probably isn't for you as there are quite a few gory/bloodbath images! Anyway, a definite thumbs up from me & I will be buying it when it's out on DVD. I recommend it!",8,2,5,14 July 2005
