The Expendables 2," Oldies fire up big time!!
","Never thought the series was an expandable one, but well, Expendables 2 is a far better movie than its predecessor. With some extreme but good action - was a bit over the top in the first movie, some very good comic liners, and then the screen magic with an ensemble cast - not to mention the electrifying vibe when one gets to see the oldies together - the movie is definitely a thrilling outing, and to the ones who grew up watching Stallone, Bruce and Arnold, this might serve to be nostalgic too. This time we have another oldie as villain, Gosh!! missed VanDamme and his kicks. Statham so funky, crude and witty with his oneliners as usual. Nothing thought provoking with the plot, in fact its just cooked up to bring together the characters. With a not so loud music and some decent action choreography, the movie finally ends up satisfying the masses. Definitely worth watching for the Oldie's fans. :)))",6,0,0,16 October 2012
Catch Me If You Can," handsome biography!
","Biographic movies are always populace, this one in particular would be my personal favorite of all. The ensemble cast in a Spielberg movie which happens to be a biography would be nothing less than good, true to keeping the name high, Catch me If u can is a terrific watch for those who love biographies and for those who enjoy quality movies.Leonardo Caprio And Tom hanks teaming up with Spielberg was more than enough for me to watch it way back like a decade ago. And never feel tired watching it even today, for its all handsomely shown, those life pictures of a con man from real life. Frank Abagnale JR would be your real life hero instantly, cant think of another person portraying Frank than Caprio, hes just handsome and his behavioral acting would have helped a lot in it. The music was tricky with a mystical feel adding tempo to the chase and tricky parts in the movie.When a hearty biography is directed by Steven Spielberg cant complain about a flaw anywhere, but to be fair, it wasn't that engrossing as a Schindlers List - i know its stupid to even compare- and would be able to give only a 8 though i thoroughly enjoyed it",8,3,4,13 October 2011
Midnight in Paris," A fantasy which sedated me with sensuousness..
","Who wouldn't love Paris! Who doesn't love fantasy! And if you are in love with both of them, Midnight in Paris would be the fantasy you would hate to come out of. And i too felt the same, I never wanted to come out of the dream I was in, i was sedated with sensuousness walking along with Owen Wilson through the streets of Paris, meeting eminent artists whom i always loved to meet, and finally getting someone whom i could walk in the rain with, talking about everything which I love about.Woody Allen was never my favorite until i saw 'Midnight in Paris'. Owen Wilson was cute - I really would like to see more of him in meaty roles like this rather than in silly romcoms, Marion Cotillard was sweet & gorgeous. The casting was too good, that it would be hard to find anyone misplaced. The music and background score did make the movie experience merrier. I would love to watch this movie over & over again, its hard for me to stay away from this fantasy..",9,1,2,13 October 2011
Horrible Bosses," Boisterous and hilarious..
","Oh its a skimpy plot, whats new with those goofy one liners you take it from movies and put it across to ignite a laugh!! Well, the point is you did laugh, right? And so goes Horrible Bosses, you take it all light from beginning to end and why else do you wanna see this movie for than to have some great time! I was amazed by the ensemble cast,and wondered what they were all gonna do in a supposedly run of the mill comedy when i first read out the preview. To my surprise it all came good, really filling in places in that stupid little plot, but oh boy, were they too comical! I mean, kevin spacey & colin farrell getting to do some real cracker ass roles was really hilarious. The main characters - all of them TV biggies - acted it out with precise comic timing, notably Jason bateman who takes the lead in the movie. A big awww to jennifer aniston, the poor thing was just confined to be a bitchy boss.IF you really want to smoke out your boss, this is one ride you ll definitely love, coz its too boisterous & a bit too hilarious.

The Amazing Spider-Man," not an amazing Spider-Man
","The Amazing Spiderman doesn't quite live up to be an amazing reboot of the franchise! But its a good one time watch, and probably lovable for those who got fed up with the Sam raimi - toby maguire Spiderman trilogy.. To be fair, The Amazing Spiderman might be close to the plots in comics, Ha! but then the rebooted comics version isn't a good reason to reboot an already successful movie series. Dejavu when you get to see too many scenes so identical to the 2002 film, understandably all grown from the same roots, hmm and like many, i strongly believe the reboot version was a bit early to be made..Some better things, however, worth mentioning : the pretty Emma stone who is much better than Kirsten Dunst ( don't give a darn whether its Gwen or Mary Jane, they are meant to be Spiderman's Lady love anyways). A strong villain in Dr.Lizard, thanks to good CGI (poor characterization and casting though) and finally Music composed By James Horner. Andrew Garfield is cute - a good leap from 'The Social Network' - but isn't quite the lovable Peter Parker we know.The script, the dialogues and the closing lines were all lacking the firepower and the emotional vibrancy, just to make a comparison, the voice-over of Tobey's Spiderman(With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-man.) still gives me the flare, which sadly is a huge miss with the rebooted movie. Memories afresh how I got crazy with Spider-Man(2002) during my schooldays!! hmm, The Amazing Spider-Man never comes close. 6/10",6,11,24,6 July 2012
Goon," bloody, gritty & sporty!!
","I wasn't expecting the bloodshed in an otherwise heartfelt and appeasing movie which would be remembered for the astonishing, rather absorbing performance by Sean William Scott more than anything else. I should admit, haven't yet got the hang of Ice hockey and the fighting thing. But the sportiness and the spirit of the protagonist did rush my ante up - now that's not uncommon with Sport movies. But something's different about this one, Doug Glatt & his 69 wouldn't be that easy to forget coz he's too simple, stupid and darn crazy when he's a team guy.With some good laughs, a love affair and a tough antagonist, it might sound quite clich√©d. Yet you would never feel tedious, rather you feel for the rawness and emptiness Doug Glatt is going through. His blending with the team, the crush he develops for the girl, the way he pushes out the baddies from cornering Laflamme, and the final wait for fighting the evil legend is all knitted very well. The background score keeps the tempo intact. Some of the scenes and circumstances needed much detail, it never went over board being too dramatic. For instance, the climax was a bit ragged and missed out some emotional values. Sean William Scott deserves special mention, he sheds all his typecast personas and have acted the character of Doug Glatt with all his heart. Thank God, he isn't just 'Steve Stifler' anymore.Goon is a feel good movie which is simple yet compelling and a bit too bloody for a sports movie. Loved it.",7,37,50,14 March 2012
Drive," classy & stylish...
","I couldn't believe my eyes watching the sensitive romantic notebook guy getting to do some chilly acts which was stylish and raw. Vow, i just loved him, Ryan Gosling just went up in my books. The movie was an awesome watch with some catchy music throughout, very realistic screenplay and funky editing - the 'vice-city' model titles in the beginning was fresh and aberrant.The story about a stuntman doing 'transporter' model getaways at nights,and leads an isolated life was so remarkably filmed, considering the fact that it was all without any trace of surrealism, whatsoever. True, Taxi Driver came to my mind at times - those on the road scenes, the traffic lights, the isolated life choice, and even wearing the mask which reminded me Robert De Niro's Mohawk hairstyle - it never hindered me from enjoying the movie, felt more like a classic being revisited with style! Carry Mulligan was just okay as the female lead, but a mother!! that didn't go down well with me - perhaps i still got memories afresh of a confused teenager in 'An Education'.Car Movies are known for action, thrilling chases, and rocked up music. And if you need to watch one with some substance filled stylishness, Drive 2011 is a must watch, its classy and stylish..",8,0,3,10 October 2011
The Theory of Everything," the beautiful theory!!
","The buzz around 'The Theory of Everything' is in full swing, thanks to the various nominations including the Oscars it garnered this awards season. I wouldn't have dared to bet on the movie having any chance to come this far when I first saw it, courtesy the screener copy (hate to reveal being a pirate :P), none whatsoever except Eddie Redmayne for his portrayal as Stephen Hawking in the movie. Well here it is, standing tall with handful of nominations this awards seasons with 5 nominations in the Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor, Actress and Original Score. I just watched it a second time in cinema, this time falling more in love with the movie.The story about Stephen hawking, the world renowned physicist and cosmologist wouldn't have been unheard of, there being lot of movies, documentaries and TV shows on his life and works. This movie though is shown from Jane Wilde Hawking's perspective who was Stephen Hawking's wife. The plot is not purely biopic as such but the movie takes us through the hard life Stephen Hawking had to go through after he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease and how his wife backed him throughout the tough times before eventually parting their ways. It would be an instant love affair if you happened to be a Stephen Hawking fan and for others you would appreciate the heart breaking drama which never goes over the top melodramatic. I loved the ending very much, a fitting climax drawn parallel to his work 'A brief history of time'.The lead cast terrific and deservingly front runners in acting categories this awards season. I have had seen Felicity Jones (who played Jane Wilde Hawking) earlier and this without doubt is a breakthrough performance from her. The surprise package comes in form of a relatively unknown Eddie Redmayne who nearly nails it to perfection as Stephen Hawking, the kind of performance which reminds us of Daniel Day Lewis in 'My Left Foot'. Music by Johnson Johanson deserves a mention too for rendering an emotional texture to the frames. I, for one, loved the pace of the movie barring the lagging scenes somewhere in the middle, it kind of felt like dragging the movie into a heartfelt climax. :) To conclude, 'The Theory of Everything' isn't the type of movie for casual movie goers who are looking for some time off the park. I would recommend it to serious movie buffs or for those wondering what the Oscars buzz is all about!! Not the perfect biopic yet a must watch. My rating 7.5/10",7,1,1,18 January 2015
Reservoir Dogs," bloody and graphic drama...
","Am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, his cult classics, his nuance screenplays and his occasional cameos. And Reservoir Dogs was the only one which i missed out. Well here's a Tarantino era on the making in Reservoir Dogs, his debut work, was just immense and classy like any of his later movies. With no stupid surrealism, a clean and real violence plot which is definitely not meant for the sensitive fellas.There's no hanky-panky twists, no dupe-floured action scenes or chase, yet, u get engrossed in the drama. Well i loved the theme of getting into how the heist went wrong rather than showing how it went wrong or say what the heist was all about! Now that's why i thought it was real classy. You don't get to feel a female part in the whole movie, i don't get reasons to think why! The ear cutting scene was really bloody, but oh, i have seen worse from Tarantino.A must watch bloody-noir film from Tarantino, not my favorite, though would definitely top my list.",7,0,0,12 October 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," brilliant finish to the epic trilogy.
","The Dark Knight Rises(TDKR) is a brilliant finish to Nolan's Batman Trilogy. Its no mean thing to live up to the hype, The Dark Knight being one of the most acclaimed movies of the decade and Christopher Nolan being a God to fanatics ( me included :P), the rave previews, the buzz for Oscar had all made it the most anticipated movie of the year. One should watch it to get an idea why it was fussy all along!! And for the fans this is a must watch.TDKR isn't flawless as its predecessor Dark Knight, yet turns out to be a stupendous movie, courtesy to a brilliantly written screenplay by Nolan brothers. The best thing about the screenplay is the buildup of each characters, each of them getting ample screen time which though ends up with a long running time ( 2 hours 45 minutes). It might not be appealing to first timers, for the movie carries huge references and links from the previous movies. The Villain Bane is hunky, destructive and ferocious unlike The Joker who was quick witted and wily. And there's a surprise package too which would keep u glued to the story - I shouldn't have said that :P. The movie isn't but without minor plot holes, certain things might just stop on you.Ensemble cast with most of them reprising their roles from the previous movies, Marian Cottillard & Ann Hathaway sizzle as the lead ladies, Joseph Gordon comes in as a handy sideman (the Robin from Comics). The score by Hans zimmers keeps your pulses pumping throughout, and worth mentioning is the technical brilliance. Very less CGI for a comics movie, but yes the brilliance of Christopher Nolan is one to watch out in action scenes, the setting, the locations. TDKR is too realistic, dramatic and a bit too heavy for a superhero movie, and as someone said, makes all other comics movies look so cheap!! Don't miss this.",9,1,4,20 July 2012
Before Sunrise," soulful drama of an idealized romance ..
","Why do we need twist and tales and stuff in romantic movies to keep it going when it can be kept simple & meaningful! Before Sunrise is such a masterpiece, very simple yet so sophisticated and one of the best romantic movies ever made - romcoms, scifiroms, noirroms and all those movies with romance as a subplot are categorized as pure romantic genre nowadays.What would you do with your girlfriend if you are given a day off! what would you talk about, where would you go to spend time! yea, its difficult, the world is no small compound to take her for a walk or tell her about stuff you want to, in a day. Well, the movie is all about two strangers finding something between them so soulful that they can spend only a day before they have to part ways.The movie voww, it is all like magic, the conversation, the walk and the night spent and the final departure which was so painful. Am not that fond of Ethan Hawke, but then its magic that works out when hes there with Julie Delpy. The final scene leaves a lump in your throat, so poignant when those places they visited are shown vacant in the end. The background score would only thicken your sore throat.A soulful Drama with nothing but pure romance, indeed one of the the best romantic movies ever made.",8,5,7,13 October 2011
Up in the Air," Picture Perfect!!
","I love George Clooney, and i would say i Loved Ryan Bingham more, he stays close to my heart coz he resembles me and others who feel are solitary and isolated in their lives. And there are certain things which are true to itself as shown in the movie. You don't always get to watch a happy ending where a Lady who gets stuck somewhere in our life be there forever, neither are we gonna change our life style to be someone else!Ryan Bingham, a downsizer & motivational speaker - motivational stuff as to how to avoid commitments and stay single and lively - subtly shows how men have been more to being negative and having the dark shades of life, i mean firing others and abstaining from relations is a common plight with guys around, who doesn't find the meaning of life and just lives on somehow. Ryan Bingham is even referred as a 'cocoon of self banishment' to which he replies its simply a life choice. The way the story winds up was so beautiful, the climax scene in which George Clooney stands alone watching the schedule in the airport would be my favorite.George Clooney was suave, neat and perfect as Ryan Bingham. I still believe he deserved more than an academy nomination. The supporting cast were all good, anna kendricks so perfect as the newbie, Vera Farmiga and Jason Bateman doing their parts so well. The soundtrack was good and drove the movie in good tone. The snaps from the air were all beautiful. Wonder why The movie didn't win a single Oscar!",9,0,3,13 October 2011
