Source Code," Am I the only one havinh deja vu?
","The plot of this movie is not bad, though the scientific explanation for me at least is a joke. However, we should be used to that, so it's just a minor setback. The true problem here is the great resemblance of the plot with Deja Vu, the movie with Denzel Washington (who was way better in my opinion) - the components are completely the same, even down to the pathetic mechanics of the machine, that allows time travel or passage between plains of existence, dimensions or whatever you like to call it. Oh, maybe, just maybe the usual light bulb with heatable wire continues to glow for some time after you switch off the power just because it can't cool down immediately. (Seriously disappointed 'bout that).",Null,0,1,25 August 2011
