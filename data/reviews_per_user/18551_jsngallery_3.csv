First Man," Mission: FAIL
","I really looked forward to seeing this movie. alas my hopes and dreams were crushed.
First Man is a bad attempt at trying to recreate Apollo 13 (which is a top notch movie). too much 'home' stuff which leaves the viewer not caring about any of them (wife, kids, etc). puking, why???
its just a bad lifeless movie. its all about $$$ these days.",1,3,6,10 March 2019
Darkest Hour," another oldman flop
","Why do people keep hiring gary oldman to be in their movies??? hes bad, just bad. (remember him trying to be sid vicious?) now as winston churchill hes even worse. especially the speeches, which is what puts wc all together. wc never spoke like he was introducing two wrestlers who are about to 'get it on!!' no, wc's speeches were monotoned and low key, but the phrasing and delivery is what made him a master of his craft. not this oldman crap",6,0,5,11 August 2019
Arrival," unimaginative
","If you're going to make a ufo type movie, make a decent one. they're walking 'sideways' (ooh ahh) inside a rock tunnel with a 100' wide screen at the end of it. thats the movie!!! can u believe that?? cant they have used their imagination a little here?",3,0,4,10 February 2019
