Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Flawed but positive start to the prequels
","The visuals are stunning and were groundbreaking back in 99.
Too much politics for some people but I found it realistic and engaging.
It has its problems but the good stuff outweighs the bad stuff.
All the Maul scenes are great. Mcgregor is great choice as Kenobi and then dual at then end is flat out stunning - even now it holds up and is better than anything in the new Disney flicks!",8,1,3,30 December 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Authentic Star Wars
","This one stays true to the originals.
The tone, the visuals are great with great battles and a Vader scene that will blow your mind!",9,0,1,22 December 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Fun and trippy
","Very fun and trippy. Reminded me alot of Flash Gordon.
Too much humor though throughout even in the serious scenes.
Odins arc should have been better",7,0,3,22 December 2017

","Seems to be trying to be more Marvel-esque..
Some great scenes",6,0,0,22 December 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Is as good as the trailers suggest
","Perhaps the best Marvel film.
Cap and Tony both make you feel for their cause.",9,0,1,22 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Brilliant conclusion to the prequel triology
","Underrated but very good conclusion to the prequels. A major jump up in quality.
Links up episode 3 to the original films perfectly.
The battle scenes, the lightsaver duals - Anakin versus Kenobi, Windu versus Sidious and Yoda versus Sidious are all awesome.
A must watch.",9,3,4,30 December 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Underrated
","Loved the dark and different tone.
Affleck is great as Batman.
Will age well.",9,6,9,22 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Rehash
","Is a poor cheesy reboot of the originals.
Even the worst of the prequels had a strong story with scenes you could enjoy again and again. Not so with this.",4,2,2,22 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Rehash
","A cheesy and not that good reboot of the originals.
Even in the worst of the prequels there was a strong story with scenes that you could watch again and again. Not so in this one.",4,2,2,22 December 2017
