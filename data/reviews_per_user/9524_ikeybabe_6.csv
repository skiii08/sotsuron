The Lobster," Dull, Tired and Daringly Useless
","At first intriguing, the spark of interest fizzled like cotton candy dipped in water - flat, still water. This film was pure and simple boredom. The character dialogue was stiff and while the main character did his time in the hotel, it was somewhat interesting with how everyone interacted with one another - from the horrible duet on stage to the private time lap dances. And then it got painful. I kept thinking when will it end, maybe there's a pay off at the end, but NO. The end was so benign and unfinished. I guess I didn't get it. And you know what? I don't want to get it.",2,3,5,13 August 2019
World War Z," Scary, Suspenseful, Action-Packed Zombie-Fear-Fest at it's BEST!!!
","I absolutely LOVED this movie!! This is now one of my very favorite zombie movies of all time. I saw this at an early screening prior to its release and now I've seen this and the director's cut/rated R version several times. I can not get enough. This movie is like a fast-paced, teetering on the edge, racing freight train that could topple over and destroy everything with your next heartbeat. It's scary. It's mind- boggling. It's action-packed from the moment the first zombie appears. The suspense doesn't stop for a moment. You can barely catch your breath before the next body-wriggling, plague-infested being attacks! Brad Pitt was fabulous and smart and still looked incredibly hot! The Israeli soldier was terrific. Even little Tommy was bad *ss (but only in the Rate R version). I tried reading the Max Brooks book years before the movie and it was difficult and not at all like this movie version. The movie is 200 percent better. The script was really well-done. The make up and cinematography was all superb and the action sequences stellar. And the solution to the zombie epidemic was genius! I can not wait for WWZ2!!",10,7,11,16 June 2014
Don Jon," Yo Intenet Porn Can Be Addictive
","This was a good, solid entertaining movie about growing up. The start was rather annoying. I don't know why but it annoyed the hell out of me every time Don Jon tossed that balled up tissue in the trash. The clanking sound was all WRONG! Who did the sound effects? Tissue makes a soft swishy sound - not a loud clunky sound. So, that bothered me. And then the extreme Jersey accents were a bit of a pain too, but then I realized these were the stereotypical Jersey characters - oversexed, loud, self-absorbed young adults. *SPOILER ALERT* Jon thinks he's the typical guy who just happens to self-pleasure to Internet porn every day, multiple times during the day. Yo, you're addicted dude! It's not until he meets a pained older woman who teaches him that reality can be way better than the unreal digital fantasy. I liked the juxtaposition of religion too - no matter how much you've sinned recite a few holy phrases a few times and you're good to go. The acting was stellar, the script well-conceived and nicely paced and overall a really good movie. And, Rob Brown was terrific - his character was a solid friend to Don Jon. Lastly, I loved how Jon's sister, who didn't speak throughout the movie, relayed her emotions with these telling looks - until she finally speaks the truth! Nice job JGL.",7,2,2,16 June 2014
Lion," Beautiful, Moving and a Must-See Film
","This was a beautiful, moving film. It was inspiring and so hopeful and brought tears to my eyes. Dev Patel did an excellent job and that little boy who played the young Saroo was exceptional. The director did a great job in the retelling of this true story. The screenplay relayed the heart and depth of this incredible story. The cinematography gave the story beauty and texture. This is a must-see film.",9,0,0,12 August 2017
Mr. Nobody," Masterpiece!
","I was completely thrown by this film. I didn't know what to expect and what I got was the furthest from my imagination. By the time I was halfway through the film, I thought it had similarities to Terrence Malick's 'Tree of Life' which I absolutely hated! This movie, however, had far more dialogue and despite the fractured pieces of reality slicing in and out the clips clicked in my head. It all made sense and by the end I was in awe of what the director put together. It was visually stunning, lyrical and fascinating and humorous. The acting was so good. Leto was great throughout as was Kruger. I will say after a while Polley (whom I normally love) just got on my nerves. Her character was either smiling or crying in the most irritating way. (I just wanted her to slash her wrists already (I know, so cruel)). This film was about choices and exploring each decision to its fullest. It's about the road not taken - taken. And at the end when the old man takes his last breath, I smiled because it all came together in a masterpiece of creativity and emotion. Bravo.",8,6,8,4 May 2014
Never Back Down," Never Back Ugh!
","Never an original moment...Never great acting...Never again. This movie was so predictable from the very start to the end. It was a slightly older 'Karate Kid' kind of flick. The main character was such an easy target. The antagonist may as well have called the main character 'chicken.' That was enough to bait him into a fight. Amber Heard's character was the usual ridiculous blonde chick love interest who is so vapid you could practically see 'vacancy' signs behind her eyes. Djimon Hounsou is usually cool to watch, but his Mr. Miyagi was lacking and that whole story line of how this kid teaches him to re-connect to his family was utterly ridiculous. The only redeeming parts to this film were the fight scenes, even though they were heavily choreographed and had the typical hero- gets-beat-up-throughout-the-fight-and-despite-his-many- injuries wins in the end theme. So, there ya go.",3,0,1,20 March 2014
