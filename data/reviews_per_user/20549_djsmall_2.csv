Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
","'The Phantom Menace' has taken a lot of slack from the press since its release May 19, 1999, but I am very confident that in twenty years when the Special Edition is released, everyone will consider Episode One a noble edition to the Star Wars film family.  In fact, I believe 'The Phantom Menace' to be the best Star Wars film yet.  It is full of subtlety and, contrary to many fans' opinions, is ripe with spiritual symbolism and metaphor.  I have seen it ten times now (in the theater) and with each viewing I puncture an additional subtextual layer.  It astounds me that the most prominent criticism of the film is its 'flimsy' or 'childish' plot. The plot is incredibly complex, far more complex than any other Star Wars film to date, and definitely too complex for the average child.  It took me roughly five viewings to fully understand the entire plot, that is, to really grasp the motivations behind Darth Sidious/Palpatine's political maneuverings.  However, the politics are only skin deep, so to speak, and underneath lies a vast spiritual symbolism which catapults the mythological nature of the Star Wars films to another level.  The planet of Naboo, with its two estranged civilizations of water-dwelling Gungans and land-dwelling humans, is a wonderful metaphor for the divorce between the mind and the spirit ('The Naboo think their brains are so big,' says Boss Nass, the Gungan leader) which is threatening to tear our own civilization apart; indeed, this menacing inner phantom of disequilibrium can be found throughout the film and gives it its beautiful meaning.  I love this movie, as should every Jedi-at-heart who desires true peace and justice in the world.",10,0,0,9 June 1999
The Iron Giant," A Film Gem
","Once in a great while a movie is released that reminds filmgoers just how powerful the medium can be.  'The Iron Giant' is one such film.  The fact that it is animated only adds to its magic.  The animation is absolutely superb, strongly rivaling Disney's best.  The screenplay is wonderful, all of the characters are incredibly three-dimensional (something which, alas, I have a difficult time saying about the most recent Disney films), and the voice-over acting is simply the best ever.  The young boy who voiced the character of Hogarth Hughes is a true talent - his voice coupled with Hogarth's animator's drawing prowess gives the audience the best depiction of a young person ever.  Hogarth is very honest and real-to-life, from his innocent romping and make-believe sessions to his deepest and most heartfelt emotions; at no point in the film does director Brad Bird patronize youth. Hogarth is unabashedly human and not a 'boy as he should be' caricature. Not since Elliot in 'E.T.' has a young character been so real.The character of the Iron Giant is so well drawn - both visually and emotionally - that I often had to remind myself that he was not a living, breathing human being.  In fact, the magic and mystery of this film is the fact that it took a character of cold metal and made it more human than the average person one sees walking down the street.  The Giant is a wonderful symbol of modern man and the beautiful heart that is still within him, albeit buried deeply beneath layers of materialism and aggression.  This movie is a great reminder of man's true nature - 'souls don't die' - and the possibility that, with the help of the Hogarth Hughes within him, he will discover the Superman he truly is.",10,1,2,7 August 1999
