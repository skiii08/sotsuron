Blade Runner 2049," Amazing film for film lovers!
","As many have said, this film is amazing! All the actors are good, all the set designs are great, the camera shots are great,the atmosphere is cold and wonderful, the story is interesting, and the musical score was great! Even though the film is almost 3 hours long, to me it didn't feel like it. I didn't want the movie to end. Its a cold and dark sci film with perfect pacing to grab you in the story. Some say its boring or too slow paced...but the pacing is what gives it it's character. Having certain lights and sounds go over certain areas of the set take you into the world. It's the little things and that attention to detail that the cast, crew, and director use to bring the audience into the story and the world of Blade Runner. This sequel definitely honors the 1st blade runner film, ten fold. You can't cut scenes and dumb it down to just action, jokes, and explosions...and make the movie only 1 hour and 30 minutes...we have too many movies like that already. The 1st movie proved there is an audience for this type of film. And some say that the 1st film was boring....well that 1st film happens to be a cult classic among many others. This movie will go down the exact same way...as a classic film experience. Not everyone will get it. Some people like deep meaningful films....even some films where there is no dialogue at all....but they still get pulled into the film, and escape in the story. I have about over 3,000 movies in my collection, and I love movies. I've loved movies ever since I rented them in the 80s on beta cassette tapes as a kid. I know a good movie when I see one, and damn, I'm backing this film as an awesome movie experience that I cant wait to see again.",10,7,15,11 October 2017
