Saturday Night Fever," A classic
","I don't know what people are expecting from this movie but it is what it is. It is not the fluffy disco movie that people think it is.This movie leaves many issues unresolved and is actually the snapshot of a period of time in the lives of the characters. They are dysfunctional - they have loads of problems. That's what makes it real.Saturday Night Fever is a great movie from a great period of time. The music serves as a backdrop to a time in the lives of the people in the movie.If you've never watched the movie and you get the DVD, watch the VH1 'Behind The Hits' presentation on the DVD before watching the movie to make it even more real.",10,0,1,6 August 2003
Quiz Show," Don't know how it could be any better
","I like action movies. This is not an action movie. This is a GREAT movie.If you like parachuting yourself into another point in time and learning about events in history then this is a must see. No, it won't blow you out of your seat with thrills and chills but the acting is top notch and it never lost my attention for a moment. Actually, I've seen this 5 times or more and I never tire of watching it or introducing it to a friend.If you want to go back in time to see the quiz show scandal of the late 1950's, then this is a perfect 10 in my book.",10,1,1,12 August 2003
