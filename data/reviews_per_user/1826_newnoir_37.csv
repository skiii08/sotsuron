Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Sinematic Sequel
","Yes, Sinema, movies that are too much fun to not be a bit of a sin to watch.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a worthy follow up to Kill Bill Vol. 1. But it's a bit of a letdown from the sheer perfection of 1.It's a bit slow, talky, and without a doubt needed an action climax worthy of the final action sequence of 1.But, that aside, it's still a fine film. With an Oscar worthy performance by David Carradine. I'm reminded of Burt Reynolds comeback flick Boogie Nights. Neither won the Oscar that year and it was a crime. Burt should have played the part of the coked out titty bar owner. He seemed like an ideal fit for it.And Carradine is one of the coolest cats in Sinematic history with this performance. He has one line that sums him up in the flick, 'I'm the Man.' And he is.The film cries out for one last epic action sequence with perhaps The Bride taking on a ton of Bill's henchmen and then Bill himself. Another thing that vexed me is that Carradine got into the best shape of his life for this film and he is almost NO action sequences in the film! None! Now who wouldn't want to see Bill kicking some serious ass in this? A flawed, but still awe inspiring, blood drenched, sin filled and sinematic sequel!",Null,1,4,19 May 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," INDY!
",The most kickaxe action film of all time!  Indy Jones is one bad dude with just a hint of an antihero in his personality to give him that extra edge. I love that almost crazed look he gets in his eyes when he spies an ancient priceless artifact almost within his grasp.  No other action film has wowed me like this one.  This is my fave Spielberg film by far and if I had to be stranded on a desert island with one action movie this would be the one.,Null,1,1,19 July 2000
Oldboy," Best Film Of The Year
","Oldboy has to be on of the greatest revenge films ever. If not one of the best films ever.Min-sik Choi is mind blowing as Dae-su Oh, the drunkard who is imprisoned for reasons unknown for over a decade. The film has many influences, The Count of Monte Cristo being the most obvious.Just when you thought the revenge flick was old hat, along comes an awesome shock fest like Oldboy jammed with dark humor, action, and some of the best fight scenes in recent memory.Many people rave about the one take fight scene where Min-sik takes on a whole gang single handedly. It's an amazing fight. And one the viewer is exhausted after watching in a way. Dae-su starts off fighting the gang frantically, claw hammer in hand, he falls to the ground, you think he's beaten, exhausted, but he comes back fighting, he falls down again, seemingly he MUST be beaten this time. But no! He fights back and when it's all over it's amazing to see he's defeated and worn down the entire gang. And all of this shot in ONE TAKE! Incredible.There are plenty of small moments in the film that are excellent as well. One of mine being the voice over line where the hero wonders if fifteen years of pretend training can work, the short ensuing fight scene has a great, hand held kinetic energy to it. It's a mini-film school for directors on how to properly do a bad ass movie fight. And the hammer and teeth scenes are some of the most intense tooth torture scenes since the movie Marathon Man.This is one of the best movies I've ever scene, with a twisting, turning plot that is totally off the wall and fresh and unpredictable. A revenge epic that tops or equals Kill Bill. Four stars out of four for director Chan-wook Park's masterpiece!",Null,11,96,9 May 2005
L.A. Confidential," A Little Of This, A Little Of That, L.A. Style, That Is
","Yes, yes, I must confess.  I walked out on this film the first time I saw it.  I rented it months later so I could see what supposed GREAT filmmaking was all about and what all these punk movie critics were raving about. It's a good film, not a great one.  Certainly it was better than that other acclaimed film that came out the same year, 'Titanic'.  In my somewhat less than humble opinion that is.  I'm a Los Angeles county resident m'self so I usually dig L.A. films.  Kev Spacey does a fine job here actingwise, as do Russell, Guy, and Danny Devito.  Off the record, on the QT, and very...hush hush.  Later.",Null,1,2,27 October 2000
X-Men," Utter Crapola
",What a waste of a great comic book series.  There hasn't been a great film made about a comic book superhero since Chris Reeve's Superman films. These guys needed a better script and a better director.  Bryan Singer doesn't know how to direct big budget action special effects pictures.  The casting isn't the best and the plot is dull as can be.  The dude who plays Wolverine has some good one liners but that's about it.  Patrick Stewart and Ian M. were good choice for their characters I have to admit.  But this piece of crap film making still doesn't work.  But if you are easily amused you will probably dig this.,Null,1,1,30 September 2000
Taxi Driver," PURE GENIUS
","Taxi Driver is one of my fave films and remains one of the best flicks ever made.  Marty's direction is flawless, Robert's acting is outstanding, Paul's screenplay is magnificent.  The pain of rejection from society, from New Yorkers, from women, from everyone and everything it seems fills the character of Travis Bickle.  I know all to well what its like to be driving by couple in your car like Travis does and seeing every guy you pass with a beautiful girlfriend on his arm.  When it seems everyone else seems so together and you seem out of place.  A thumb in a world full of fingers. Travis is God's lonely man and we feel for him.  I remember lines like when Travis muses aloud about the Cybill Shepherd character: 'I realize now how much she is just like the rest of them.  Cold and distant.  Many people are like that, women for sure.  They're like a union.'
When you see where Travis took the Shepherd character for their first date, however, you kind of have to laugh at why he can't realize altogether why she rejected him.  I've known some women you could take to an X theater on the first date, don't get me wrong, but Cybill's character in this flick is not up for that.  Not on the first date anyway.
But humor aside, this film retains all of its raw, emotional impact it had when it was first released.  I saw the 20th anniversary re-release into theaters back in 1996.  I remember I was 26 yrs old at the time.  The same age as Travis is in this film.  Weird.  That added an extra connection to the film for me.  Plus the way Travis' crummy apartment was strewn with Doritos bags and Big Mac containers and the way Travis walks into a store to buy some milk and a six pack of donuts before shooting an armed robber is something I have done many a time in my life as a bachelor.  Getting the donuts, not the shooting thing.  But anyway, see this film.  See it soon, see it now.  It lives, it breathes, it is cinema at its finest.  Rock on Travis, baby.  I got the sense at the end of the film his near death experience ahd strangely purified him.  I felt a similar way after seeing this picture.  Over and out...",Null,0,0,2 July 2000
Barry Lyndon," Pretty Good Kubrick Fare
","Stanley Kubrick, my favorite filmmaker, has made MUCH better films.  Not to mention much faster paced films.  This doesn't compare the The Shining or Clockwork Orange but it is still passable entertainment.  I am amazed to see Ryan O'Neal in a Kubrick film.  This was made before Ryan was all fat and washed up like he is now.  But if you like Dangerous Liason type costume dramas you will enjoy this if you can handle the very tedious pacing. Ciao.",Null,1,1,13 July 2000
The Color of Money," COMMANDER USA LIVES!
","This is a good Scorsese film.  And Newman and Cruise give fine performances as an old time pool hustler educating a young punk hustler in the ways of the grifter.  But the real star is Jim Hendricks or Commander USA from the old USA network show, Commander USA's Groovie Movies from the 1980's. There's a scene where Mary Elizabeth is watching TV in her silken panties and Newman walks in and on the TV is a clip of the Commander USA TV show! I wonder if that was just an accident or if Marty Scorsese was a fan of the Commander's show?  What ever happened to the guy who played the Commander anyway?  I'd luv to know!  That's an obscure thing to praise this film for but that's the way I feel, Neal!  Long live Commander USA! Sure!",Null,1,3,20 October 2000
Pitch Black," Vin Diesel Rocks!
","I was expecting this to be another cliche ridden Alien rip off.  And it was cliched it some parts, but the performance of Vin Diesel made this a great kickass sci fi time at the movies.  Everything about Vin Diesel screams presence.  The man has a presence like few young actors of today do.  I'm glad the film makers had the guts to make his lead character an antihero. See this movie soon, you won't regret it.  Viva Vin Diesel!!!",Null,0,0,4 October 2000
American Psycho," Say What?
",This is a pretty good film.  But it is waaaay different than the book it is based on.  The book was more epic and had a more serious tone.  This version is way too jokey and over the top.  David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick mighta been a better choice of director for this material.  I am amazed a woman wanted to direct this movie.  But the filmmakers did a decent job if nothing else.,Null,0,0,7 September 2000
The Shining," One Of The Great Horror Films
","This movie scares me every time I see it.  The music will have your skin crawling just like mine is with every viewing.  I saw a scene from an old black and white film called 'Curse of the Demon' with a scene of a character walking through a hallway with similar creepy music playing like the hallway scenes in 'The Shining'.  I wonder if that film is where Kubrick got some of his inspiration for the mood of this flick.  The visuals are both horrifying and beautiful.  And like all Kubrick films there is a good dose of humor throughout the picture.Be sure to find a recent copy so you can see the short documentary on the making of 'The Shining'.  Scatman Crothers was honored to the point of tears to be involved with this picture as you will gather from the short interview they have with him.  Seeing Jack Nicholson brush his teeth before going back to set is also good from some grins.  A feature length documentary and an in depth interview with Stanley Kubrick himself would've been nicer though. Kubrick was such a private person I guess we should be glad they got what little footage they did of him.
Jack Nicholson gives possibly his greatest performance as well.  Shelley Duvall, Scatman Crothers and the little boy Danny do terrific acting jobs too.  See 'The Shining' and watch at night with the lights out and prepare yourself for a night of having the wits scared out of you.  Later alligator...",Null,0,0,16 July 2000
American Beauty," GREAT FLICK BUT WHAT'S UP WITH THAT T-SHIRT?
","I really loved this film.  One thing I found QUITE disturbing was the scene where the Annette Bening real estate character is showing a house and one of the potential buyers (a short dark haired woman) is clearly wearing a t-shirt with the face of the infamous Chinese communist leader CHAIRMAN MAO on it!  What's the deal with that?  I didn't see the shirt mention in the published screenplay by Alan Ball.  Sam Mendes, the director, musta slipped it in.  Chairman Mao?  Cripes, how many people did that guy kill?  American leaders have more than their share of blood on their hands but Mao was absolutely evil.  Mao was anti-freedom, anti-freedom of speech, evil to the core.  It doesn't get anymore anti-American than that.  Still a great movie, but that shirt has gotta go!",Null,0,1,15 June 2000
Aliens," One O The Most Kickaxe Action Pics O All Time Ya Dig?
","Aliens rocks.  Pure and simple.  James Cameron is a balls to wall action director and he shouldn't be wasting his time on fluff like that 'I'm the king of the world' crap.  Terminator and T2 and Aliens remain three of the greatest action flicks ever made.  They still hold up today on the brink of the 21st century.
Ripley is one of the best action heroines ever put on film and this is a more than worthy sequel to the first 'Alien'.  This film has plenty of suspense but has much more axe kicking sequences than the first film.

","Drive! Amazing, stylistic, supremely gory, animalistic, blood soaked, violent, with a killer look, score and soundtrack reminiscent of Michael Mann's Thief, only better.Gosling's brooding loner Driver has nearly no dialogue, a quality I dig in a character, and yet says everything with just his face, his violence and his stone cold cool scorpion jacket, as he gets himself in high stakes trouble with organized crime in neon lit Los Angeles.A kickass script, master direction by Nicolas Winding Refn, and a fantastic supporting cast with the mega buxom and super sexy Christina Hendricks, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston, Carey Mulligan and comedian Albert Brooks cast against type as a bloodthirsty gangster.One of the best thrillers of the new millennium bar nada.",Null,2,4,6 April 2015
Caddyshack," Slob Humor At Its Finest!
","Ah, yes, Caddyshack.  The king of low brow comedies.  I remember working at my dad's San Leandro restaurant as a young jerk and loving the sound of the Kenny Loggins' 'I'm Alright' theme song as they played Caddyshack on the big screen TV's in between sports games.  That friggin' song made me wanna jump down and rock out, baby!Caddyshack isn't so much a movie as it is an excuse for a bunch of one liners, gross outs, and stand-up comedy schtick.  Chevy Chase, Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield were at their funniest in this movie.In fact, this movie was made back when Chevy Chase WAS still funny. Remember those days?  Man, was that a while ago.  I read an article recently where a reporter asked Chevy, 'What happened to your career?'  And Chevy looked totally pained and wounded at that cruel question.  Chevy's a great comic actor, he just needs to track down another decent script like the one in Caddyshack and get his comic chops back on track. But I dig everything about this film, the background music, the great comedy gags, the gopher, even the look of the ritzy, snob ridden country club setting!  Freeze gopher!",Null,10,15,20 July 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Badass Martial Arts Revenge Flick Sinema Extravaganza!
","Without a doubt, the best film of 2003. And certainly master filmmaker and derivative auteur extraordinaries Quentin Tarantino's best film so far.It's strongly influenced by the two Lady Snowblood films. Kill Bill tops both these flicks and then some.It is, on the surface, a simple revenge story. But QT jam packs it with dark humor, incredible action, great performances and music. David Carradine is back from B-movie oblivion with his role as Bill. Even though we don't even see his face in the flick. He is the epitome of the Most Evil Man Alive. And so cool his breath would give an Eskimo shivers.It starts of with a brutally grisly shot of The Bride (Uma Thurman) being shot through the head. I jumped out of my skin when I first saw it. And from there it was a non-stop roller coaster ride of a movie. It was unlike anything I'd seen before, I was floored, mesmerized, blown away, loving every minute of this blood soaked masterpiece.The final fight sequence where The Bride takes on the Crazy 88's is one of the great action sequences in Sinematic history. Sinematic since a movie this on the edge, this blood filled is a bit of a sin to see. It rises above mere cinema and becomes Sinema. A genre onto it's own.Remember to wipe up when done...",Null,2,5,19 May 2005
Quiz Show," Good But Overrated
","I remember seeing this many moons ago. I enjoyed it. But found it to be a bit overrated.Rob Redford is a talented director. And I wish he had acted in this in El Sucko Supremo's Rob Morrow's role. Morrow's character was named Dick Goodwin. A fitting first name.But this movie did not deserve the raves to the proverbial grave it got when it was first released. Granted, I was a number of years younger when I saw it. So maybe seeing it from an older perspective would allow one to appreciate it more.It tells the story of a famous American TV quiz show scandal and it's another in the long line of 'America's Loss Of Innocence' films. I love America with an unbridled passion (unlike some types) but She, nor any other country past or present or future on Earth, was ever that innocent.I'd rather see Quiz Show's John Turturro (looking very homely with skanky ass choppers in this role) in a much better film from this era, the Coen Brothers' Barton Fink. And the annoying, talentless douche Rob 'He Majorly Sucks' Morrow befouls this movie with his presence. Thank Heaven Morrow's 'star' has crashed and burned in recent years. Let him go to the dustbin of entertainment where he belongs. His 'acting' is worse than X-rated goat fisting porno. Okay, it's not that he is all bad. He's just one of those actors that annoys the Hell outta you. We've all got performers who rub us the wrong way. He's this reviewer's Carrot Top. And I kinda like old Top's comedy. Hell, he plays at the Luxor, my fave Vegas hotel. I like the room service there and the buffet that resembles an ancient Egyptian archaeological dig. And Chivas whiskey they sell in the lobby gift shop. Good for boozin' the night away while in the City O' Sin.Where was I? Oh, yeah.Quiz Show? Overall? Yes, worth seeing. For Ralph Fiennes and Redford's direction. And El Kickass Actor Supreme Turturro. But not one that you'd (okay, me) wanna see over and over and over again, kiddo.",Null,1,3,30 March 2008
Annie Hall," Max Are We Driving Through Plutonium?
","One of Woody Allen's best. I saw this as a kid and was really disappointed when it beat out 'Star Wars' as the Oscars best picture in 1977. Years later I think the academy made the wrong choice. Star Wars was the better film (dare I say it?).It's weird to think that this killer flick was once going to a murder mystery and then Woody figured out the love story between Alvy and Annie was the best thing in it and dumped the whole murder mystery plot. I heard he recycled it for Manhattan Murder Mystery.Anyways...I loved this film and I especially liked the relationship between Tony Roberts and Woody Allen, especially the weird little quirks they had like Tony constantly calling Woody 'Max'. Those bizarre little touches, a great script and lots of all star cameos make for one great movie. And the cocaine scene is a classic for now and forever...",Null,0,0,25 July 2000

Never before have I seen a film more perfect from beginning to end.  Its also amazing how close it is to the original book.  Most films based on books take huge liberties with the text.  Not this film.  It remains a frightening, darkly comic classic to this day.",Null,0,0,17 July 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's Best Film So Far
","With all the hoopla about 'Pulp Fiction' many people forget that this QT film was much better, in my opinion.  Grittier, more violent, brutal, funnier.  It's amazing what a filmmaker can come up with when his whole story revolves around a bunch of gangsters hanging around an old warehouse and just talking, bitching and bleeding.  A nice little film noir flick. With influences by John Woo, Kubrick, Big Jim Thompson, and Scorsese.  I don't know why, but I also liked the nice shade of green the warehouse interior was painted.  The multicolored graffiti background that Mr. Orange uses as a mock stage to practice his commode story was a nice touch too. These are the weird little details of a film that only I probably like.",Null,2,4,18 October 2000
Pulp Fiction," THE BAD ASS MAMA JAMA BIG DADDY OF ALL MOVIES!
","Quentin Tarantino struck mega paydirt with this little diddy of a movie. And invented, or perhaps, re-invented a whole genre of film.  Tarantino is perhaps the most derivative filmmaker in history, but much like rap music, Tarantino has taken the art of ripping off other people's ideas and making them fresh and cool.The shoots out and wiseguys in black suits with skinny ties?  That's straight outta John Woo and Scorsese.  The pop culture references?  That's Godard.  The trippy way the film jumps back around in time?  Jim Jarmusch and Kurosawa did it first.  Despite all of this Tarantino has made a brilliant film.  You don't just see 'Pulp Fiction'.  You drink it, eat it, bleed it, breathe it, savour it, spit it out and ask for more.

Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs: A Mad Saint
","Saw the Steve Jobs film for the second time. Under Ridley Scott's direction, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay and Michael Fassbender's portrayal as Apple founder Steve Jobs, you really get a feel for the man and his genius, his cruelty and his madness.The film takes place over the course of three new computer presentations years apart with flashbacks to Jobs career and early life. The final scene is almost painfully beautiful with a perfect song by The Maccabees used on the soundtrack. You get the feeling the world really lost someone special when Jobs died so young. Jobs changed the world. The film leaves you with a sense of wonder, what would it have been like to be someone like Steve Jobs? A self-made billionaire who grew up a loner with few friends.I read that Jobs repaired old cars as a hobby and worked as a repo man in his youth and that the gig suited his personality. That's one scene missing from this bio pic I'd have love to seen. That and what Jobs thoughts were on the working conditions in Apple factories in foreign countries where they had to install suicide nets to save the workers from jumping to their deaths. Or his friendship and rivalry will Microsoft's Bill Gates.Good night, dark prince.",Null,2,5,8 November 2015
Love Actually," I Love Love Actually
","Quite the cool film.  And talk about a lot of subplots and characters!  I usually don't care for romantic comedies.  Except when they're good, like this one!  Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as the Prime Minister.  The many subplots pretty much all work.  The one section that didn't work was the loser English chap who went to that USA bar and easily picked up three chicks, that seemed silly and out of place.Hugh Grant's opening voice over in the first scene at Heathrow Airport was very touching, very poignant.  The music is fantastic too.  Bill Nehy's Christmas rock and roll song is destined to be a Christmas classic, baby.Richard Curtis' film can even make the most bitter amongst us think love is all around us, actually.

Kong: Skull Island," Killa Thrilla Kong!
","Caught a righteous screening of Kong: Skull Island at the local IMAX theater and it's what you'd expect, a rock 'em, sock 'em monster movie!It stars a great cast, the indomitable John Goodman, Mister Senor Love Daddy Samuel L. Jackson, the great John C. Reilly, the super cool Tom Hiddleston, the dynamic Brie Larson and her amazing gravity defying breasts and Toby Kebbell as the CGI actor of King Kong himself, yet some may be wicked bummed Andy Serkis didn't return to reprise the role of Kong from the 2005 Peter Jackson film.This cast of motley characters is sent to investigate the mysterious Skull Island, home to the legendary simian giant King Kong, and they end up bruised, battered and bloody and getting mucho more than they bargained for on the monster filled isle.Some may say this sequel pales in comparison to the 1930s original King Kong or the 2005 Jackson remake, yet this film's just for kicks and it delivers the goods with a healthy side badassery and a killer stinger scene that promises many more kooky and cool Kong sequels to come.",Null,4,8,17 March 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Beauty
","A beautiful film.  I must have seen it twenty times.  No joke.  Thomas Newman's haunting musical score still touches me with every viewing.  This is one of those films that plays on TV almost constantly and yet you still find yourself watching it every time.  I guess its because of its epic scale and like a great painting you can find some new in it each time you view it.
Frank Darabont does a great adaptation of Stephen King's novella from his 'Different Seasons' collection.  I guess the theme of each novella in the book relates to the different seasons.  The quote 'hope springs eternal' is at the preface of the Shawshank section of the book and if you've seen the film you know hope is the movie's central theme.
Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins make a great pair in this, probably the best on screen pair since Redford and Newman.  See this film and you may become a Shawshank fanatic like so many other people.",Null,0,0,20 July 2000
Fifty Shades of Grey," O' Fifty Shades!
","In the spirit of Saint Valentine's Day, I bought into the hype and went to see the film Fifty Shades of Grey.As someone once wrote, the ending was less a grand finale than a grand finally. Wooden acting, no full frontal nudity, sex scenes cut short. I can't remember the last time a major studio erotic film was released, and this doesn't bode well for a revival of the genre.Some scenes worked, including some bondage scenes, yet you never feel fully engaged with the innocent female lead Anastasia or the mysterious young billionaire and S&M enthusiast Christian Grey.My guess is the book was wall to wall sex, which is what made it readable despite the schlock value and the book's humble origins as Twilight fan fiction, the movie needed more of that, or a better screenplay and director.",Null,2,7,14 February 2015

I usually like Rich Dreyfuss but not in this movie.  It was nice to see the always weird and sexy Alicia Witt in this.  She's one of my most favorite milky skinned redheads working in film today.

The Greatest Showman," The Greatest Showman: One of the Year's Greatest Films!
","I remember seeing the trailer for this film around Christmastime and while I dug some of the actors I wasn't that impressed with it. A movie musical about the life of circus impresario P. T. Barnum? Cut to the aftermath of this film's opening weekend. It was written off as a box office bomb. Then slowly audiences made it a worldwide sleeper hit. Finally I saw it at a matinee and found it doesn't just grab you by the opening scene, it grabs you by the opening credits. The first of ten incredible songs takes you on this whirlwind musical journey that doesn't stop. Plus it's literally a highly colorful film that lights up the screen.Hugh Jackman as P. T. Barnum is perfectly cast a romanticized version of the flawed, controversial showman. This film was a true labor of love for Jackman, taking him over seven years to get it to the big screen. And much like the critics in Barnum's day, the stuffed shirt critics didn't get or like this film. One critics's review I read actually complained about the treatment of the animals in the film! When any astute viewer could tell all the animals were CGI! Another described the newspaper critic character in the film played by Paul Sparks as a weaselly little move by the screenwriters, guess that character hit too close to home for that douchebag extraordinaire critic! Those who can't do teach, those who can't teach, review.Hugh Jackman and Zack Efron have incredible chemistry in this film and the rest of the supporting cast including Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Keala Settle and Sam Humphrey all give fantastic performances. Though I would have liked have heard actor Sam Humphrey's real voice in the film and not dubbing they used.Musicals are all about the music and that's the catalyst that makes this great, albeit imperfect, movie musical great.

Casino Royale," Bond, Dead Serious Bond
","Man, Daniel Craig played Bond dead serious. Oh, a little humor here and there. But he took it in a totally new direction.If I recall from the books Bond wasn't a guy with a wry sense of humor. He was a pretty serious badass.Daniel Craig is the first Bond who looks like he could actually hurt you. I mean break you in half. Connery was tough, menacing. But nowhere near as badass as Craig. The guy is friggin' ripped.I love Connery, Moore, Brosnan, and even the somewhat lame Dalton and Lazenby.Connery played it tough and serious. Moore played it more charming and he was always my favorite Bond. Lazenby just did his best. And Dalton wasn't really a good fit.Craig is without a doubt the best actor to play Bond. The one with the most range. I don't think there has been a good Bond film since Moore left the series. But Bond is back with this kickass new film. Can't say I was too jazzed about seeing Lame, uh, sorry, Dame Judi Dench back as M. M is a male character. And if this is a re imagining of the Bond series what's Dench doing back in the series? She always plays the same sourpuss role. She isn't a bad thespian just overrated.And Martin Campbell as the director? I wasn't too thrilled that he was returning for this installment. I still haven't forgiven him for those uber lame blue screen shots of Brosnan free falling to an descending airplane at the start of GoldenEye. Play the GoldenEye game, avoid the movie. I was hoping for Christopher Nolan as Casino's director. But Marty baby more than exceeded my expectations. The theme song from this Bond flick is one of the best I've heard in years. Good show all around.Still, there are flaws. Some of the action sequences are tepid, trite and not that interesting. Not bad but nothing spectacular like we've come to expect from past Bond's. And the final action sequence with a collapsing building descending into the sea isn't the greatest. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd though more than holds her own as Bond's counterpart. And the screenwriters maintain a good chunk of Fleming's original story in the flick.I was a tad bummed Pierce wasn't borough back for another Bond movie. But in all honesty, I dug him as Bond but not the films he starred in. When it got to where they were giving Bond lame invisible cars. Well, it was time for him to go. Just as well, Pierce gave us one of his best film performances ever with The Matador shortly after that. Moore made one Bond film too many and should have gotten out earlier when he got a bit too weathered for the role. Fate stepped in and saved Pierce from that.But. Casino Royale. Best Bond in a long time, baby. Nowhere near groundbreaking as Nolan's re imagining of Bats. But in the general ballpark. Ciao.",Null,1,5,20 November 2006

The scenes that use Peter Gabriel's The Book of Love always get to me. Beautiful stuff, wonderfully executed.It's a remake of, arguably, a superior Japanese film that tells the sweet story of an unhappy lawyer who's life is reinvigorated with of all things, ballroom dancing.Are parts of the film predictable? Sadly, yes. My guess is the original screenplay by Audrey Wells was superior to the final studio approved version. But it all still works very well.Don't listen to the cold hearted naysayers who bash this flawed gem. I saw it multiple times at the theater and each time there was a great vibe in the audience. It seemed like everyone left loving this movie. It's cool to see Jennifer Lopez make a good movie again. I can't remember digging anything of hers since Out of Sight. Kudos all round.",Null,0,1,31 December 2004
Casino," Good Film About Wiseguys In Vegas
","I saw this film a whole buncha times when it came out.  But the shot of the dummy in the exploding car in the beginning looks SO totally fake.  How could a master director like Marty miss that?  That bit has always driven me nuts.  Why didn't they just use tinted windows on the car?
That aside, this is a good Vegas mob movie.  It isn't as good as 'Goodfellas' but its good enough.  You get a real sense of 1970's Las Vegas as well as a nice cameo by my fave rave TV movie host, Joe Bob Briggs.  Its also nice to see Sharon Stone in a movie that doesn't completely suck for a once.  That gal has made more bad pictures than Photomat.  Marty should stick to directing mob movies like this.  Its when he tries to do something different we get stuck with junk like 'Kundun' or 'Age Of Innocence'.  Rock on Marty baby...",Null,1,2,19 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," SPACE OPERA
","Don't see the retouched 'Star Wars' film with the so called extra footage for anything other than curiosity.  The stuff they added was just a bunch of cheesy state of the art CGI images that just clutter up the scenery.  The 1977 original version is the only TRUE version.  Lucas even wimped out and toned down the great scene where Solo blows away Greedo in the nightclub! What a wuss.  Still a great film and a great filmmaker but don't waste your time on the re-released version.
'Star Wars' was more than a film, it was an event.  It changed movies forever with the single opening shot of the starship zooming over the audiences' head at the beginning.  No other epic sci fi film since has been able to show spaceship dogfight battles with as much energy as 'Star Wars' and probably no film ever will.",Null,0,0,19 July 2000
Cube," AWESOME
","One of the best films I've seen in years.  Original, suspenseful, frightening.  The idea and execution of this film is so simple yet it's still a very complex and brilliant piece of work.  The acting is sometimes a little over the top but it still works.  The most amazing thing to me is that the filmmakers only built one cube and made it seem like they made several.  This is clever, clever filmmaking.  Whoever said there are no good ideas left hasn't seen 'Cube'.  Dig it.",Null,138,195,23 January 2001
The Nice Guys," Los Nice Guys!
","The Nice Guys turns out to a worthy successor to writer-director Shane Black's cult film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.A neo-noir thriller and buddy action comedy set in the gloriously tacky 1970s, The Nice Guys stars Russell Crowe as a badass for hire and Ryan Gosling as a clueless yet capable, effete yet effective private dick on the hunt for a missing big tittied seventies porn star with help from Angourie Rice as Gosling's teenage sleuth daughter.While not every scene is cinematic gold, the film more than makes up for it with double loaded barrels of action, laughs and a literally glass shattering climactic finale set in a Hollywood high-rise hotel.Dig it.",Null,3,7,9 June 2016
Goodfellas," A Perfect Film
","What can I say?  The greatest film of the 1990's?  The best mob movie ever made?  One of the best films ever made?  All these comments are equally true.  The music, story, dialogue, acting, direction, camera work, everything in this film is flawless.
Ray Liotta will never give a better performance.  This is the kinda film that will make you WANT to be a wiseguy.  This flick also captures the purest essence of New York City.  New York is almost a character in the film itself.  Brutally violent, hilarious, gut wrenching.  All these emotions add up to one great movie, ya hear?",Null,0,0,19 July 2000
Furious 7," Fast Furious 7
","Sometimes I feel compelled to follow the crowd and see the films everyone else is going to see. Which is how I ended up at a matinée of Furious 7.Pretty much what I expected, slick, loud and proud filmmaking with by the numbers storytelling, save for a few scenes, my fave being Dwayne Johnson's Luke Hoss' character's insane in the membrane scenes with a minigun trying to takedown a helicopter that's the second coming of Blue Thunder.The paint-by-numbers plot concerns badass Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw, seeking revenge against badass Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, for the near death of his brother. Mostly it was an exercise in how the filmmakers used semi-believable CGI to have the late Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner seem like he was a lead character in the film, with a rather touching tribute to him in the finale.One change at the end that might have worked better, rather than an on screen 'For Paul' title, show a closeup of Brian's or Dominic's cars with a vanity license plate with seven letters that says, FORPAUL, and then have the car(s) cruise off into the sunset, fast and furious.",Null,1,2,5 April 2015
