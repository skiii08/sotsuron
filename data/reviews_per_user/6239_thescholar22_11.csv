Catch Me If You Can," Catch me if you Can Review
","This movie came out in 2002 and was directed by Stephen Spielberg. It's about this guy Frank W. Abagnale Jr. coning as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer in the 1960's. The thing here is that he did all of this before he was 21. The movie starts off with a game show talking about why he did all of this. Then it goes to Frank in French prison in 1969, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He tries to escape but the flashes back to 1963 with his father, played by Christopher Walken, winning some kind of award. Later his father is investigated for tax fraud. As his father slowly loses his fortune and gets divorced Frank runs away. He learns coning from some tips his father did earlier in the movie. After coning as an airline pilot he starts to get the attention of an FBI agent Carl, played by Tom Hanks. Carl almost gets Frank but he gets away the first time they meet. Then he cons as a doctor to throw the FBI off and then a lawyer. You probably know from the opening Frank will get caught eventually. Thought after he gets back to America the ending is actually pretty good and satisfying. I think this movie also started to create the 60's craze until Mad Men perfected it a bit later. Anyway this movie is pretty good as a biopic about Frank's coning and struggle to get back his fortune.",8,2,4,9 June 2015
Star Trek," Star Trek (2009 Reboot)
",First seeing this I thought it would just be a retread of Kirk and Spock growing up. Then about halfway thought the movie it really starts to change and really becomes a reboot. Overall J.J. Abrams did a good job with this Stark Trek movie and Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as Kirk and Spock are good.Some people attacked this for having a lot of it borrowed from Star Wars. Like the bar scene and the ice planet but it's pretty good on it's own. The cast does a pretty good job as the original Star Trek crew. A The twist and the middle is pretty good for Star Trek and people who watched the other Star Trek movies will go 'That didn't happen!'.Even though they try to explain it and not ruin the original shows. This way J.J. Abrams can do his own thing with Star Trek without destroying the time line and the other Star Trek shows people loved. I'm trying not to divulge too much because it's that good of a movie and I hope people get a chance to see it. This is pretty good for a movie and reboot and the sequel I'll do some other day as well.,8,2,4,9 June 2015
Kickboxer," Kickboxer Review
","When I saw this on Crackle just recently at first I didn't take it as seriously. Not because of Jean Claude Van Damme but because it was on crackle and I don't like commercial blocks in movies. Not because there are blocks but because they have too many stretched out and might be just the same one over and over. Also when Van Damme talks it's like his accent is too thick even for a French or Belgian guy. Anyway this movie starts out with Van Damme's brother fighting in a kick boxing tournament and winning.They then go to Thailand to fight this guy called 'the Tiger' but his brother get's his back broken. Van Damme get's his brother to a hospital by this black guy Winston. At the Hospital Van Damme finds out his brother can't walk again after that blow to his spine. After that he goes around trying to do a montage and finding trainers for Muai Thai Kickboxing. The choreography for the kick boxing is okay for a Van Damme movie that is and I think he helped with it as well.Some of the dialog from the Thai people sounds dubbed at times if you look close enough. Or even care, but anyway Van Damme goes into some town for this trainer guy to help him. The trainer tells him to go to the store and after that there's another training montage. There's even this scene where the trainer and Van Damme go to a bar and after a few drinks, he starts to dance a little and he seems to do pretty well. He also find love with the trainer's daughter but after a bit she gets kidnapped and attacked by the Tiger.At the end Van Damme's brother get's kidnapped by the Tigers goons and threaten to kill his brother if he fights. During Van Damme's fight with the Tiger the trainer and Winston go to save Van Damme's brother. They arrive at the match and Van Damme beat's up the Tiger and wins.This is a pretty basic martial arts/revenge film but it seems to have a bit of a cult hit.",6,0,0,9 June 2015
American Sniper," American Sniper Review
","At first I heard this was a bit of propaganda from some people. Also dad spoiled the ending when scanning through it on his own. I was surprised that Clint Eastwood did this since he can be a good director when he can like in Letters From Iwo Jima and Grand Torino, which I WILL review one day. Anyway the movie starts with the sniper played by Bradly Cooper, at the front lines. Then it flashes back to his upbringing hunting with his dad. Then he joins the Navy Seals after seeing an uprising on TV with his brother after a rodeo.He seems to do good for the training that's being thrown at him and then he meets a girl at a bar before his sniper training. They start to hang out every now and then and then get married. The sniper gets sent to the front lines and gets his first people kills, a boy and his mother, and has regrets at first. Then it ends up being in the middle a sniper vs. sniper story when he tries to stop a rival sniper from killing a kid. That sniper vs. sniper story dates back to Vietnam my dad told me, also thought it would be an action movie but it's a drama.There's also this scene with him pinned down at some building and then a sandstorm comes by. Thought that was the end but it wasn't and it was hard to see everything when it hit. I also remember this quote from the movie when the sniper says 'Hell of a thing to stop a beating heart.' and that's so true. The ending I won't give away since I don't want to spoil it for all of you but it's pretty powerful. Even touched my dad a little.The whole movie seems okay like a 7 out of 10 and my dad thinks Bradly Cooper looks like Sean Penn. Even though Clint Eastwood can be a good director and some of his work was amazing too. This movie is just okay but give American Sniper a watch when you can and see what you think of it.",7,0,5,9 June 2015
Big Hero 6," Big Hero Six Review
","Today I went to see Big Hero 6 with some friends. It's based on a weird Marvel comic of the same name and it's pretty good. I saw it in 3D too which I couldn't quite know if made it more engaging. The movie takes place in San Fransisco and is about a kid genus Hero. He makes robots as well as his brother which made a robot that kinda looks like a balloon. I'm not going to mention much because I don't want to spoil the plot too much. The animation is amazing and the story can have some touching moments as well. Even some slight twists here and there too. At the end I was surprised that Man of Action helped make it. To those who don't know he made cartoons that tell a great story like Ben 10, Generator Rex, and Avengers: Earths Mightiest Heroes to name a few. Most of his work is on Netflix if you ever want to take a look at them. Anyway it's a pretty good movie from Disney and Marvel. Almost up to par with Guardians of the Galaxy for comic adaptations so far. Anyway it's a good movie and the balloon robot is pretty caring and kind too.",8,2,4,9 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Felt like a waste of Mark Hamill and even China didn't like it.
","When I finally watched this on Netflix I was a bit worried since the last movie, 'The Force Awakens', felt like more of a retread of 'A New Hope'. Though in this movie it felt kind of slow at times and even China thought of that as well. Basically Rey goes to this planet to train with Luke Skywalker but he now wants nothing to do with the force. Even though he brought back balance to the force in the original trilogy.Also the resistance base is discovered by The First Order, somehow, and the Resistance tries to evacuate everyone they can on their planet. There's also this scene where Leia gets killed in space and it seems like an amazing send of something since Carrie Fisher died after this movie was done with. Then somehow Leia uses the force to get to a ship and is hospitalized for most of the movie. Then this purple haired lady takes over and it seems like she doesn't cooperate with others resistance members along this slow chase to some planet. Not even The First Order tires to cut them off from the planet by sending some extra ships along the chase at the planet to ambush them.While Ray is on this planet with Luke Skywalker she tries to learn some ways of the force, but Luke ends up being kind of tired and grumpy at times. Luke also mentions how he tried to teach Kylo Ren but Luke ended up trying to kill him, since Kylo felt to angry with the force. Feels kind of out of place given Luke's struggle with the Empire in the original trilogy and how he was going no to bring balance to the force.Also some of these resistance members try to get help from the thief on a casino planet. Then the thief when freed and then trying to sabotage a main First Order ship ends up betraying the resistance members, kind of making that side story pointless.Then Rey leaves the planet Luke was on and gets kidnapped by the first Order and gets interrogated by Kylo Ren and this guy Snoke. Kylo and Rey end up killing Snoke and his personal guards. Rey then leaves and helps out the Resistance on this other planet that's made of salt and has crystal foxes.Still felt like Ray didn't know or learn anything with her time training with Luke, feeling pointless as well. As Rey helps the resistance, Kylo ends up being on the salt planet and sees Luke at this entrance to some bunker. As Kylo and Luke fight it's discovered Luke is force projecting all the way from the planet he is on and dies, feeling like Luke was just there in this movie.Leia comes out of her stasis chamber and she and Luke I think say goodbye to one another before Luke disappears completely. Then as Rey helps the remaining resistance members leave the salt planet, purple haired lady does this thing with her ship where she rams it into the First Order's main ship just as she enters hyperspace. Creating this weird and yet beautiful explosion but most of the people on Rey's ship don't see it.In the end this movie felt okay, just felt like some of these scenes dragged or were poorly pasted. Also it felt like Rey didn't go through any kind of struggle in this movie and f it felt like this was a complete waste of Luke Skywalker. Hope the next movie thought ends up better is all I'm wondering.",6,4,8,30 October 2019
Sausage Party," It was okay, sad how the animators were mistreated behind the scenes.
","As kind of excited at the concept of this movie since there isn't many adult animated movies anymore now. Even the animated movies for kids can feel like they're not trying at times. People say 'It's just for kids!' but just because it's for kids doesn't mean you don't have to try. Also saw this pitch meeting sketch from Screenrant just to see what I'm getting into and it feels like this movie is pretty basic for a adult animated cartoon. Onto the review now.The movie starts with this supermarket and the food sing this song to start the day about going to 'The Great Beyond' when they're chosen. There's also this sausage named Frank and this bun Brenda who want to have sex but can't until they get to the great beyond. Then there's this jar of honey mustard saying that the great beyond is a lie and the gods eat them.There's also this douche that's basically a jerk or a douche as people would put it. Then they meet a bagel that's Jewish and a falafel that's Arab and they all make it to the liqueur section of the store. There they meet a Native American whiskey called Fire Water, some grits that's black and hates crackers, and a Twinkie that's gay. The fruits are also gay as well and later in the movie there's this toilet paper and a condom that talk as well. There's also this taco played by Selma Hayek and she's a lesbian and likes Brenda. Also this piece of gum that's kind of like Stephen Hawking too.Around the end the food find out that the people they thought were gods can die. So they end up killing the people in the store and after that the food has this big orgy. It does't look that graphic, then again I've seen hentai so it felt tame to me. At then end they make this stargate to try and go to the human dimension, maybe hoping for a sequel.This movie felt okay but I heard behind the scenes the animators were mistreated and forced to work overtime without play. Hearing that it just makes me wonder about the animation industry in general now since people seem to rush this all in. Also seem to rely more on nostalgic cartoon reboots and intellectual properties. The reboots then just feel like they are the exact opposite of when the original or what the cartoon was about and that's kind of sad. Anyway give this a watch if you want but it doesn't seem to be TO deep like other adult shows now. There's just so many food puns and curse words you can say until it gets real old too fast.",6,1,1,30 October 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Watched This to Compare This With 'World's Finest' Crossover.
","I wasn't sure about watching this sinse I have seen World's Finest, the Batman Superman cartoon crossover back when I was watching Toonami as a kid. Only really wanted to watch this as a compare and contrast between the cartoon crossover and this live action movie.I was a bit disinterested since these live action DC films now get attacked for being too dark and unpleasant. Just feels like these movies don't know want they want to be is all. This movie starts out with young Bruce Wayne watching his parents killed like in the original origin of Batman. He's played by Ben Affleck, though I have nothing against him but Hollywood says he's kind of a jerk but correct me if I'm wrong, since I'm not sure. The movie then shows Bruce Wayne in Metropolis during the big fight between Superman and Zod from the last Superman movie, Man of Steel. Bruce loses some people from his company in the crossfire between Superman and Zod and this somehow makes Bruce hate Superman.Then the movie goes on with Superman story where Lois Lane goes to some African nation and Superman ends up saving her from getting killed. Also where someone finds kryptonite, a mineral that can kill Superman, somewhere in the ocean. After that there becomes this elaborate plot to try to frame Superman for murder or something like that and it starts with the African nation. This part of the movie felt a bit too intricate is all. Also Lex Luthor is played by someone else that looks like he could be his son and he just feels like the Joker but if he was a redhead. Also kind of felt like Lex in this movie has no reason to hate Superman since after Man of Steel, Lex rebuild most of Metropolis.Along the way Wonder Woman makes a cameo which is a bit out of place since this is supposed to be Batman vs Superman and not Batman versus Superman vs Wonder Woman. Though along the way Batman gets a vision of what might be the future or if the Injustice video game became a movie. Basically where Superman man conquers the world after losing Lois Lane and the Flash's future self tells Batman to create the Justice League to stop that future.After Lex Luthor, takes Superman's mother hostage, he tries to get Batman for help but they end up fighting a bit until Superman mentions his mother's name and Batman has a change of heart since it was her mother's name too. Then Lex Luthor somehow makes Doomsday out of Zod's DNA and from his, and this Doomsday doesn't feel quite right since in the comics he was supposed to be this super powerful alien. Also he didn't look like him and just his big grey monster and didn't have all these spikes on him. Though there is this scene or after he's nuked he sheds his skin but that's about it. Then Doomsday somehow can fly and get laser vision even though I didn't think that was how he was he was just supposed to be this big Powerhouse of strength.After the big fight somehow Doomsday and Superman get killed but it feels like we barely knew Superman when this happens, also he ends up coming back in Justice League as well anyway. At the end Batman emails, the Flash, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg, to put together the Justice League.This movie felt okay but I already knew that feeling how these movies have been going now. In the end it just kind of feels like now Hollywood is choosing and doing more of this style over substance with movies. Also feels like they are overpaying for the effects and actors instead of having a good story or good writing. There's this Ultimate Edition of the movie with more scenes to explain things but it might be a way just for people to buy the DVD or Blu-Ray instead. I feel like if you want to see a better Batman vs Superman crossover, just see Worlds Finest. I might even do a review about THAT then this movie.",5,4,5,3 October 2019
Ben-Hur," Ben-Hur Review
","I read the book to this by Lew Wallace first and understood some of it. Maybe it was because of some of the writing but when I saw the movie I just loved it. I was surprised that it was directed by William Wyler who did 'The Best Years of our Lives' earlier too.This was when epics of Christ were goof and did actual effort in attracting the audience. Back then they were actual epics and just a grindhouse movie like Passion of the Christ.This epic starts with Christ being born with all of the people from the good book. Then it goes to a Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, played by Charlton Heston. He hears about what Christ is teaching the world. At first he's skeptical about the word of Christ.Then after freeing a slave he's convicted of murder when the roman's come to visit. He's then taken into slavery and even meets Christ in one scene.There's also another part of the movie, the chariot race, which is considered a classic scene in cinema. I also heard a lot of people got hurt badly in that scene and I didn't know until someone told me.I won't tell you about what happens to Judah's family because I want people to watch this. It is pretty long too so give it a watch when you have a lot of free time.",9,0,2,9 June 2015
Godzilla," Godzilla 2014 Review
",Last week I went to see Godzilla with some of my friends and it was okay but better than that 1998 Godzilla. I heard that TOHO had to rename that monster Zilla and Zilla gets killed easily in Godzilla: Final Wars in 2004. The sense with Brain Craston were good but there not much of him in it. There's some other monsters too besides Godzilla and they're pretty good too. Godzilla in this movie I heard looked bloated and that his roar almost sounded like an explosion. He also has his nuclear breath where he breathes this blue fire and that's fire at it's hottest.The human element was kinda boring and bland and the only good parts are when there was Godzilla in it. I still think it's better than that 1998 one I can tell you that. In the end it's a nice reboot to a classic monster so give it a watch when you can.,6,0,0,9 June 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," Slumdog Millionaire Review
","I remember watching this in a writing class back in 2009. I kinda knew what the mood of the movie would be like. Think I even heard this thing from 'Mind of Mencia' where the says 'all 3rd world kids have in the world is being alive.'. Wasn't until I saw this film it was sadly true but also made me appreciate what I have in the world. Basically it's about a Indian kid from the slums trying to win the million dollar prize on Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. This movie was also made made by the same Director that did 28 Days Later, Danny Boyle, and it really shows.It starts of with our hero Jamal's childhood all the way up to him being on the game show. I'm going to try not doing any spoilers since this is one of those movies that shouldn't be spoiled. Seeing Jamal and this brother go though all of this at such a young age shocked me and it still does. At the end it's pretty amazing and so true about good TV, movies, books, and even games maybe.My friend Don also mentioned this was kinda based on the 2002 movie City of God when I bought Slumdog Millionaire at a dollar store recently. Never really saw City of God probably because I was too young and it was an independent movie as well. Anyway Slumdog Millionaire is a classic with all of the Indian music and locations as well. Even kinda mocks the Hindu caste system a little in the game show scenes, at least I think. I recommend watching it when you can. It'll make you appreciate what you have in the world.",8,2,3,9 June 2015
