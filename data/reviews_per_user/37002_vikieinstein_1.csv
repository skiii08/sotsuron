The Avengers," Vow awesome and fantastic movie.
","The movie is awesome, 2 and a half hours non stop action and story twists, the main thing is the movie, when the fight comes i wont that to stop. I want it to continue, it is done in such a graphics and design. Looks real and superb. Even on watching the avatar movie, i don't experience this much fun and acceleration. This movie is meant for non stop action acceleration. The climax is good, i felt sorry that the movie is over, bcoz i don't want to miss the super heroes, even my family too. Everybody from the age of 1 to anything it is, will love to watch the super heroes performing a splendid action to save the world. If you are not watching this movie, you are going to something in your life which is a world wonder project i would say. I will give it endless points if i can for making me to forget who am i for the 2 and a half hours. Enjoy guys... See you in the next avengers...",10,1,4,28 April 2012
