Skyfall," Worst Bond movie in years
","Being a big James Bond fan I looked forward to this movie coming out, especially since all I heard and saw about it in reviews were glowing reports about how this was the best Bond movie yet.As far as I am concerned this is one of the worst Bond movies ever made. The plot is weak, the Skyfall theme song does not live up to what I would call a catchy tune that would have you running it over and over in your head and overall it was just a boring and overly long movie. It lacked the Bond type gadgetry that we all have come to expect in a Bond movie.Three of us watched this film and all of us came away with the same opinion, it doesn't live up to the James Bond standards.",2,11,23,17 February 2013
