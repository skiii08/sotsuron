Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stupid Critics (besides Roger Ebert)
","This movie had every thing  the special effects were the best I've ever seen, the story fit the Star Wars name perfectly, and The characters were probably cooler in this one than in the original (besides Jar Jar Binks, will somebody shoot him, PLEASE!) Darth Maul was cool as hell, with his double staffed light sabre, and his satan type lookAll in all I think (and so did all of my friends that have seen the movie) that this film lives up to (or passes) the name Star WarsStupid Critcis",10,0,0,22 May 1999
Se7en," Amazing!
","What a movie, how could I expect such good things from a movieThis movie had it all, the chills, the thrills, and it scared the hell out of me, because of how realistic it was, the acting, directing, and script were amazing (especially Kevin Spacey)Although a lot of people wouldn't like this film  because of how dark and depressing it is. But in my opinion this film is perfectA true 10/10",Null,0,0,13 May 1999
Taxi Driver," Scorsese' best
","When I first saw Casino a friend of mine told me that it wasn't anywhere near as good as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Goodfellas I thought this Scorsese guy must be the greatest. So I went out that same night and rented Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Cape Fear Everyone of them blew me away (My friend was right, all of them were better than Casino) I would say that Taxi Driver is Scorsese' and DeNiro's best work.

The Game," Amazing
","David Fincher has done it again! The Game and Se7en are two of the best films I have seen, they are so dark and both are greatly actedThe lead role (Micheal Douglas) Is perfect for the role and Sean Penn was amazing,Out of ten I rate this film 9.5",Null,0,1,12 May 1999
Reservoir Dogs," cinematic genius
","Quentin Tarantino proved his cinematic geniusness with this filmIt is a crime film that is (to some people) depressing. The story is that there are criminals that set up a jewelry store heist, but it goes wrong, cops are there in 30 seconds There has to be an informer among them, but who is it? that is the question you have to figure out before it is revealed.10/10",10,0,2,13 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," AMAZING!
",Star Wars (as a trilogy) is the best sci-fi I have ever watched having watched Star Wars since I was just a kid. I think that the special effects of the original release were great and still aren't outdated.Out of ten I rate the trilogy 10,10,0,0,12 May 1999
The Godfather," Truly amazing
","This movie is so great, it has excellent acting, directing, screenplay, and the reality of the whole thing, the actors didn't look like actors the actors looked like real people.However this film would be found at a movie store in under the Crime section, everybody knows that it is a film about family. one of the most dramatic films (that I liked) that I have ever seen and the best too10/10",10,0,1,13 May 1999
