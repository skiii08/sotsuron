Casablanca," This is my all-time favorite movie!
","The ranges of characterizations, the ranges of emotions, are performed by what turned out to be a  simply perfect cast (although not always first choices). I just watched it again and the more objectively I try to view it, the better it gets. Even most of those who don't agree with me that it is the BEST movie ever made have to concede that it ranks in the top ten. If you haven't seen it at least three times, there is still more there - reason to see it again.",10,1,1,5 June 2001
