Raiders of the Lost Ark," Grab your fedora, uncoil that bull whip, and sit back to watch one of the best films ever!
","'If adventure has a name, it must be ________________'. Who can't finish this sentence without saying 'Indiana Jones'? Raiders of the Lost Ark must be, without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made in movie history. Right up there with Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Casablanca, and Suparman, this film marked a milestone in film history. Creater George Lucas came up with the idea of a 'globe-trotting archaeologist' long before he came up with the Star Wars story. However, when coming up with the story of the space adventure, Lucas shelved the idea of this adventurer for a later time. During the opening weekend of Star Wars, Lucas and fellow friend and movie director Steven Spielberg were sitting on a beach in Hawaii, talking about what each of them will do in their future. Spielberg commented 'I've always wanted to direct a James Bond film,' and Lucas quickly commented - 'Nah, forget him, I have something better. It's called Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Then and there, Lucas told Spielberg all about the idea of an adventurer who was more like a grave-robber than scientist, who went all over the world embarking on adventures while finding wonderous treasures. Spielberg was in love with this idea for a film, and said on the spot 'Let's do it.' Spielberg agreed to direct it, while Lucas would produce and overlook the project. George got the name Indiana from his dog (who also gave inspiration for Chewbacca in Star Wars). Originally, the main hero was going to be named 'Indiana Smith,' but Spielberg said he didn't like it that much. Lucas than said, 'Okay, how about Indiana Jones?' Spielberg simply said '.....okay'.After getting Paramount to fund the project, and hiring screenplay writer Lawrence Kasdan, it was time to find the one to fill the boots of Indiana Jones. Many actors were tested, but the one who had been chosen to play Dr. Jones, was Tom Selleck. Howeverm due to a contract with him and CBS (to make Magnum P.I) Selleck was forced to leave the project, and now Lucas and Spielberg had to find another person who would fit the part. 'How about Harisson Ford?' Spielberg suggested. Lucas objected, because Ford was already in his Star Wars film(s). However, after having an audition, Lucas finally agreed to use Ford.After finding the actor, now it was time to make the character's apparel. The main things that people will remember from Indiana Jones are the fedora, whip, and jacket. Those are truly the icons of Indiana Jones. Deborah Nadoolman put together an outfit which most suited Indiana Jones, including Harisson Ford. She set out to make a costume that would be remembered. If Indy were in silhouette, you'd know who it was instantly. Alright, so we got actors (including Karen Allen as the feisty Marion Ravenwood; Paul Freenan as rival Rene Belloq; Denholm Elliot as the good-hearted Marcus Brody; John Rhys-Davies as Indy's Arabic friend Sallah; and Ronald Lacy as the slimy Nazi-Major Toht.), script, costume, director, and money, so that leaves actuall making the film. Shooting was done like the old adventure serials seen on TV every Saturday morning (which Lucas got inspiration from): quick and dirty. Even though Ford did many of his own stunts (like running from the enormous rolling boulder in the famous scene), stunt men were required to do stunts such as going under a truck, and hanging onto a falling statue. The most grueling shooting was during the shooting of the Cairo Market Place scenes. Ford, who had a bad case of diarrhea, was frantic to get off the set, and move on. You know the famous scene when Indy shoots the Cairo Swordsmen? Well, originally, there was a long fight scene involved, and the actor playing the swordsman had practiced a very long time twirling the sword right just for shooting. However, Ford couldn't stand the heat, so he just said 'How about we just shoot the bastard?' Spielberg chuckled and said 'Okay!'. The score of the film was made by John Williams, who had worked on Jaws and Star Wars previously. John Williams is well known for making themes that people can hum to, and he did not fall short with Indy's theme, the 'Raiders March,' which has become an American icon in itself.Will Indiana Jones IV happen? Who knows. What we do know, is that even if the Indiana Jones franchise doesn't continue in film, it will continue to live on in fans, and people who enjoy great films. See Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and Last Crusade, to experience true movie magic. Afterall these are the films that created the legend of the man, and the man, who became a legend.",10,0,1,7 June 2005
