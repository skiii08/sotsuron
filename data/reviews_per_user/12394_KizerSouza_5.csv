50 First Dates," h o r r i b l e
","America's fascination with all things Sandler proves there is a devil, and Satan purchased this lame comedian's soul about 10 years ago.Granted, Sandler's performance in 'Punch Drunk Love' was charmingly off-beat. However, his nuanced delivery was more the work of director Paul T. Anderson, who knew to keep Sandler under a tight reign, rather than any innate talent.What we have here is a single joke (and I use the term 'joke' extremely loosely) 'comedy' that grows tired before the opening credits finish rolling. The very premise of the film, that Sandler essentially ignores ALL responsibilities (including earning a living) for several months to set up an elaborate scheme to restore Barrymore's memory, is purely idiotic. A lot of less-than-brilliant people seem to find this movie romantic, but if this is what passes for 'romance' these days, we are all doomed. The secondary-characters are caricatures of people that were never entertaining to begin with. In fact, there is not one single thing in this movie that makes it worth recommending -- it's not funny, the plot is stupid, there is not one memorable quote and the characters are all boring, lacking coherent motivation.Even the ending scene, meant to be endearing, is just plain moronic. SPOILER: Barrymore has a child with a guy that she 'meets' for the first time every single day? Their daughter is going to have some remarkable life with a mother that forgets giving birth daily. Just like the rest of this movie, this theme is pathetic and stupid.Fortunately for me (and hopefully a few other sane people remaining on this planet), I avoided Satan's command to 'love Sandler no matter what garbage he gets paid $20,000,000 to do.' If you have an IQ in the double digits, avoid this turd. 2/10",2,5,12,9 January 2005
Shakespeare in Love," Completely Overrated
","This movie shows the power of marketing. As history clearly records, the Weinsteins shoveled this thing down the throat of every Academy voter - the first instance of a studio bringing the 'academy campaign' to the public's attention. They created a false buzz about how good the movie was, immediately setting off a 'me too' reaction. No one wanted to be the critic who didn't 'get it.' The same thing later worked for that piece of high-school drama level garbage - 'Titanic.' Before this film was up for Oscar contention, all the payoffs, favors and heavy-handed sales-pitches went on behind closed doors. However, the scheme was a resounding success because this very mediocre film, with very decent, yet not exceptional, performances, took home three Oscars - including best film. To anyone who isn't aware of how Hollywood works, don't for one instance be fooled into thinking this was really the 'best picture' of 1998. It just had the hardest-hitting academy campaign. And because it won best picture, some audiences have convinced themselves that what they saw was actually something special. Marketing - it can work miracles.As for the film itself, it is definitely a lot of fun to watch. While it's got its moments of melodrama, Fiennes is affable and does a nice job of giving a silly story some gravitas. Judi Dench, who laughably won the Oscar for best supporting actress, despite having only minutes of screen time (remember that campaign!) is quite effective - very cold but with a noticeable undercurrent of humor at the absurdity of the existence of a 'Queen.' The weakest performance is Paltro, who does a fine job, but never draws you in enough to care much about her character. The big finale, which is supposed to be a gut-wrenching separation, never reaches that emotional level because Paltro fails to convincingly expresses inner desire. Oh well. Who cares - it's good clean fun while it lasts!",4,3,6,26 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Amazing How Critics Completely Dropped the Ball on This One. A Great Epic That Will Restore Your Faith in the Force.
","First, I am a fan of the Star Wars series. 'A New Hope' being the second movie I ever saw (when I was 6), I really did not have much of a choice. However, I am not a fan of biblical proportions. For example, although I know the Millennium Falcon will do .5 past light speed, I have never made myself up like Darth Maul. Nor do I have any delusions about the time-line inconsistencies of 'Empire' or the emotional emptiness and overuse of matte backdrops in 'Jedi'. I was also strikingly disappointed in 'Menace,' partly because it has several glaring inconsistencies with the events to come, but mostly because, despite its dazzling visuals, it was flat, with dialogue aimed at a 2nd grader, (i.e., - 'Coriscant, the entire planet is one big city,' told to us as we are looking at the one big city. Lucas did not trust us enough to see the train when it was 2 feet in front of our noses and felt he had to clue us in on the obvious - insulting).(MINOR SPOILERS) Yet for all this we have forgiven him, because 'Clones' is a fast paced, visually spectacular, with a wonderful story and dialogue that, while not 'Glen Gary Glen Ross' is never embarrassing, nor out of step with the characters. Hayden Christensen IS Anakin Skywalker. I have read several critics who felt he was emotionally vapid and unable to display the facade of a Jedi with the core of a Sith. Obviously, critics no longer have to know a thing about acting to find work, because Christensen's deep seething, intense gaze and impulsive outbursts are Vader's core. You feel you are actually watching the man underneath Vader's cowl and know that this boy is on the path to evil. Christensen does a fantastic job with his difficult task and deserves accolades. The rest of the cast is also top notch and tight, obviously having a lot of fun, now that the actors have had time to get comfortable in their character's skins. The only misstep is actually Portman. She is gorgeous as Padme and can be quite the action heroine (though her nanosecond recovery from a high fall from a moving gun ship was laughable). However, she never exhibits more than a cute likability, and not enough heat to convince the audience that she is so taken with Anakin, she is willing to overlook his dark nature. Surely, the movie has its silly moments. C-3PO's mishap at the battle droid factory is simply absurd and should have been cut. Actually, the whole factory sequence has a strange incongruity to it, because there's too much going on with no visible means of management or structure. R2's sudden ability to fly also seems an afterthought to solve a minor plot problem. Another weakness is that Lucas is so concerned with visuals, he is willing to sacrifice character development. Anakin had been dreaming about his mother for months, and his delay in acting on his feelings causes him to find her just 10 seconds before she dies - too absurd by any standard. At least there are none of 'Menace's' 4-second scenes with just 1 line of stupid dialogue. However these minor quibbles still do not defeat the story's epic quality or beautifully orchestrated action sequences, which are enough to convert anyone to the Jedi Order. The story has a sweeping feel to it and a grandeur of presence that may not fit with the rest of the series, but on its own, is just fantastic. The plot unfolds to us in pieces sandwiched between glorious battles. I have also read many critics were unhappy with the political exposition. Again, I often agree with critical assessment, but here, they just DID NOT GET IT. The politics of a Republic becoming an Empire IS the plot of the series, just as important as Anakin's turn to Vader and essential to propel the story. If the Republic needs an army, do we not need to see why? Fortunately, Lucas handles these scenes quickly and smartly and they last just long enough for the audience to catch its breath before the next action sequence unfolds. All well done, and great to watch.The grand finale that finally shows the audience why Yoda is the head of the Jedi Council, will send you spinning. It also sets up the rest of the series and gives away some future secrets. The worst thing about this movie is that it is the next to last one. My score - 8 Congratulations Mr. Lucas, you have done it. May the Force be With You.",8,0,0,19 May 2002
Hitch," Ehhhhhhh . . . . Pretty Average Stuff.
","I saw this movie because I promised a friend I would. It was exactly what I expected -- Hollywood is at it again!! Filling a void that doesn't exist, we are confronted with yet another 'romantic comedy.' The unique appeal I guess is supposed to be Will Smith's charisma, but is that really worth $9.50 (in Manhattan theaters)? I guess the answer is - it depends. There is no need to get too involved in the plot. It isn't novel, it isn't even a unique approach to an old idea. The perfect match-maker who is unable to relate to the person of their dreams has been done before(Emma). Is anyone actually naive enough to sit there for two hours biting their nails out of fear that Will Smith WON'T land the babe? Please.Since the plot is entirely inconsequential, what we have is just a vehicle for Smith to exercise his on-screen charm. He is OK, I suppose, but it takes more than one solid performance to make a movie worth watching. I really don't understand American audiences. Alfie was 1000000 times more thought provoking and engaging than this light-weight fare, yet no one went to see it. Maybe people just don't want to be forced to think anymore at the movies? Eva Mendes is nice to look at I suppose and can exhibit warmth that catches you off guard in a positive way. The fat guy from 'the king of queens' isn't bad, but he isn't great either.In the end, if you like Smith and are able to sit back and zone out for a while, you will probably like this movie. If you are a serious fan of cinema, then this movie is like an average slice of pizza. It gets the job done, but you don't really give it too much consideration.5/10",5,2,4,24 February 2005
Fantastic Four," Lame!
","A 6.0? Are You People all MORONS? This movie was crap. Let's review: Crap script - check! Crap directing - check! Crap acting - check! Anyone else see a pattern here? Crap crap, double crap! Ugh - the love story between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl was less believable than the one about Tom Cruise and Katie Homes. The horrid story drags along for over an hour, then suddenly picks up speed and wraps up all in about 20 minutes. On top of every other bit of ridiculous nonsense that happens in this terd, the plot-line where Ben is 'cured' of his hideous affliction, but then goes and ChOoSeS to be an ugly giant rock seals this movie's fate as a piece of garbage.Awful awful awful. I guess fans have to pretend to love it in hopes that a sequel will be better. It couldn't be worse.",2,2,4,26 September 2006
