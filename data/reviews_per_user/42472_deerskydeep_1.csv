Mission: Impossible III," psychology amongst the bangs
","Despite misgivings about going to watch this movie; expecting the usual blockbuster nonsense that Hollywood produces. However it is entertaining. It does contain Explosions, car chases, helicopters and non-stop action which is rather a let down compared to Bruan De Palmer's double bluff intelligent spies mystery. Of course Cruise is central Tom Cruise and does a pretty good job as usual which is why he's seen as a safe bet by Hollywood. But more of his screen time should have been for supporting cast, Philip Seymour Hoffman in particular. He is great actor turns in the best performance ease the villain, but had he more time he would have upstaged Cruise and exposed his limitations. If there's going to be a fourth then maybe Christopher Lee, Stephen Armourae (that would be really dark and psychological, and he would know all the science of the gadgets), Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Charles Dance (oh so suave as he kills everyone) should replace Hoffmann and upstage Cruise again.",10,1,3,26 May 2006
