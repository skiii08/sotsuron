The Blair Witch Project," Australia
","I really wanted to see this movie, but then I was told it wasn't any good, so I really didn't expect much. But I absolutely loved this film. It's the creepiest film ever and it is definitely a masterpiece. I'm sure there will be many films which will try to copy it, but this will always be a great movie.",Null,0,1,12 February 2000
X-Men," Excellent! But something was missing.
","When I walked into the cinema, the only thing that I was worried about was if I didn't understand the film.. but this movie was very easy to follow.The only problem was, when I left the cinema, I felt like I hadn't seen the full film. Things weren't wrapped up enough. Maybe the sequel will continue from the spot (I hope).Other than that, this was an excellent film and I recommend it to anyone.",10,0,0,28 July 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," One of the best Teen-Theme movies ever.
","After seeing this movie, I was very much impressed. Not only does this movie have a lot of laughs, it also has a great storyline and a good cast. If you're a fan of Clueless, you'll love this one.",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
American Pie," A good film.
","The first time I saw this movie I thought it was the best movie ever. But when I saw it for my second time (on video), I was really disappointed. Don't get me wrong... this still is a very good movie. I think I just got my hopes up about it being as good the second time around. I'm a big fan of teen movies, and this one is a good watch.",Null,0,0,28 April 2000
