The Avengers," Marvels The Avengers
","It is true that every movie has its own particular genre, and The Avengers is of the Action/SciFic genre. But a good flick is such that, regardless the genre, possesses features like: *Good 'trainy' storyline (conceived out of the script) *Emotional content (even if its a little bit of suspense, intrigue or unpredictability) *Realness (excluding the visual-special effects, which is not Real, but cool and allowed)I had such high expectations for 'Marvel's The Avengers', but i was disappointed. The storyline is very weak. The Other: 'The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power, but our ally knows its workings as they never will. ...'. How did the tesseract come about? From where and how did it come to manifest on earth? And how come the Asgardians (from a distance light years-planet) speaking English??? I could predict this movie from scene to scene till the end. Its like watching one cranked-up episode of super-man cartoon.This movie is a 143min of explicit action and special effect (which i so love), but all these, without the afore mentioned points is like eating jam without bread.Nevertheless, this is my opinion, and you are so rightfully entitled to yours. Nice day y'all :)",8,1,4,28 August 2012
