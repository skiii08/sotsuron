The Ring," The Scariest Move I Have Ever Seen
","I've seen very many movies in my life, including all the cheesy 80s gore and the 90s haunted house horror movies and what not, as well as the newer crop of more intelligent 'thrillers' such as The Others and The Cell. The Ring, however, is in a totally different league. It is by far the scariest movie I have ever seen. Ever! Highly recommended!",10,0,0,27 October 2002
