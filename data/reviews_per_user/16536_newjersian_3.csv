Child 44," If Russian minister of culture banned the movie, it's a must to see
","The Russian media these days is flooded with ugly anti-Western propaganda. Just a year ago a movie like Child 44 would be watched by millions of Russians without any objection from the Russian government. However, since Russia started the war in Ukraine, the ideological climate there dramatically changed. Now they are talking again about 'enemies of the people' and about America that wants to destroy Russia. Russian trolls are everywhere in the western media. Read their angry reviews on this site, and you'll understand that we are dealing here with a national psychosis that overwhelmed Russia. Political issues aside, the movie shows no brilliancy at all. It's very average in quality, and has many factual errors. However, it's worth watching since it shows the Soviet human tragedy and helps American moviegoers to understand it. I give this movie a score of 10 only for one reason. If it upsets the intellectual midgets like the Russian minister of culture Mr. Medinsky and his cohorts, who work overtimes to distort and glorify the Soviet past, then the movie is absolutely successful.",10,48,117,17 April 2015
American Made," American made drivel
","Although the movie makers claim that this film is based on real events, the only real thing in this movie is the fact that there was a pilot with the name Barry Seal. The rest is the pure and simple fantasy. 
The script writer has the right for developing fantasy. But what Nancy and Ronald Reagan do here? What colonel North is doing in the drug smuggling history? 
This movie is so politically charged that no room for art was left. It is schematic,chaotic, unbelievable, primitive and not worth watching.",1,5,14,12 January 2018
Arrival," Pointless, boring and disappointing
","The extraterrestrial contacts always intrigued authors, movie makers and viewers. Despite the many books and films touching that thematic, it's so overwhelming that the movie goers have an endless interest in it. However, Arrival succeeded to kill even that interest. The movie is simply boring. For minutes you should watch just a dark screen on which nothing goes on. And the dialogues are as interesting as a lesson on the dialects of the wooden frogs. But how this move got its high rating? Most of those ratings are coming from the young viewers. They have never seen the great movies of the 50s, and 60s, and 70s, so they have nothing to compare to. Any drivel that has a killer or a thousand of car crashes gets their high approval rating. Too bad that the movie industry is dying against our eyes.",1,16,31,2 February 2017
