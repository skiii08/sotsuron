Hereditary," I just didn't feel it.
","I was eagerly anticipating the release of what was billed to be an excellent horror movie for the ages. It wasn't excellent and probably shouldn't have promised horror fans to be so terrifying in the first place. I found Hereditary to be good at instilling a feeling of long-term dread. I definitely felt that. The thing was besides a few jump scares, it wasn't scary. The ending was downright silly, reminding me of several other films in the horror genre of the last decade. If scary movies aren't for you, I think you could like this one because it plays like a tense drama.",5,3,6,13 June 2018
