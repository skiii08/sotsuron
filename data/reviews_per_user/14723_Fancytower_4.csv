It," Disappointed
","I truly do not understand the high rating on this film. Is it from people that never read the book or from people that are easily scared?I know it is difficult to transfer King's novels to screen. Anyone that is an avid reader of King's knows this. I liked IT back in the day but I didn't love it like many. It just didn't thrill me like other King stories. I mean it's about a clown. Even back when it it came out, it wasn't about the clown. It's about the kids and his or her fears. And the movie totally missed the mark. Don't waste your money. The film is awful. It's like a B movie with good cinematography. Don't waste your time or money",3,1,1,24 December 2017
Fight Club," Banal and Overrated
","Uninteresting, clich√©d look at capitalism, moralism and human nature.....yadda, yadda, yadda. I think the appeal to the masses must be the 'cool' rebel element. I just found that boring and senselessPitt and Norton are fine and actually necessary for the film to even be watchable.Roger Ebert said it best 'Women, who have had a lifetime of practice at dealing with little- boy posturing, will instinctively see through it; men may get off on the testosterone rush'Yes, we see through it and are embarrassed that this movie is rated so highly",5,4,13,23 June 2013
The Machinist," Amazing
","A very sad look at self-loathing and self- hatred. The movie moves slowly, therefore, if you must have action at all times, then this movie isn't for you. If you like a slow, quiet introduction to a troubled character, then you will love it. Christian Bale is excellent. He is likable, sad, unstable, creepy, and warm all at the same time. I found the movie extremely sad and depressing as I watched Trevor navigate his psychosis.I spent many hours thinking about this movie after I watched it. Humans can inflict self- hatred upon themselves is so many ways",10,0,0,23 June 2013
Warcraft," Trailer park version of Lord of the Rimgs
","I cannot express enough how bad this movie is. It is a horrible combombulation of bad CGI and bad acting. The script could have been written by a six year old. Too much fluff and not enough substance. In other words, it is kind of like a comic book movie but without the cool characters behind it. Actually now that I've watched it completely, it's a disgusting attempt at at a cross between Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and some kind of comic book movie. Do not waste your time or money on this drivel. I do not think I can even call it a 'movie'. It is a video game, trying to be a movie and it fails miserably. Bad. Just bad.",2,3,5,1 October 2016
