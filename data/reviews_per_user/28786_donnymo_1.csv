Whip It," Very very amateurish screenplay and directing
","I thought it was one of the very worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The writing was sophomoric, the directing was really poor, and some of the acting was poor too. Ellen Page was fabulous, as always, but even she couldn't pull this one out of the toilet. It was laughingly bad. The plot was weak to begin with, but the weakness was compounded by really dumb plot devices added willy-nilly throughout the movie. A fire marshal? Really? Her friend just up and kisses Birdman, out of the blue? Please. And the swimming pool scene had me howling with laughter at how bad it was. I really thought I was going to like the movie. I love Drew, I love Ellen Page, Juliette Lewis cracks me up, I love Jimmy Fallon, and I was really looking forward to seeing roller derby. Yet even my positive prejudice couldn't save this one. Really really poor job.",1,9,26,31 January 2010
