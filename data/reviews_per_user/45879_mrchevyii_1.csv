Ford v Ferrari," Best Racing Movie I've ever seen.
","Being a gear head, they got this movie on par. Not too many scenes about lingo that nobody will understand, I took my wife and she thought it was going to be a guy movie, she was in tears at the end. Centers more around the relationships between Carroll and Ken, and Shelby International and Ford Motor Company. Straight up fun and drama. I will owns this movie, just waiting for the Blu-Rays to come off the press. The racing scenes were not complete CGI, they were real scenes with added touches. It feels real because it is real. If you haven't watched this movie then you are sadly missing out on a great time.",10,1,1,7 February 2020
