50 First Dates," Unexpectedly enjoyable
","I went to this movie on a date (her choice) expecting to not find it as charming and entertaining as it was.  I found myself laughing exceptionally hard at some of the jokes.  Then, the paradox of my review: the movie is what you'd expect.  (what?) It's a romantic comedy, and who cares if it kind of reminds you of, say... Memento, or even Groundhog Day.  I didn't care.  So there's a few things that don't/wouldn't quite add up in real life.  Nothing ever does...  I still thought the film was a riot.A note about the humour: much of it definitely IS Sandler humour, so some who hate him (or even Rob Schnieder) might be predisposed to not finding anything funny.  Well, not me.  Schneider, and even Sean Astin, provide fantastic laughs, and of course so does Sandler.    For the dramatic areas, I actually found myself positively moved by one of the scenes, towards the end.  I was glad that there was no hollywood-type medical miracle/cure, as well, which may have plummeted the film's credibility, in my eyes.  All in all, it's no epic, but a romantic comedy (emphasis on the comedy) that I positively award a thumbs up. (one of few)7.5/10",Null,0,0,7 March 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Enjoyable
","Anyone going to this film expecting more than goofy coincidences and misunderstandings, throwing realism out the window in favour of light-hearted comedy, is expecting far too much.  I'll be the first to say 'don't judge a book by it's cover', but from the trailers or tv spots you can't expect anything more than that.That being said, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Yes, from a critical viewpoint I'm not so sure about the chemistry between Hudson and McConaughey, but big deal.  I found myself laughing despite how ridiculous both were being throughout the movie.  A good date film for laughs, in my opinion.All in all, I rather liked it; the film doesn't try to be anything more than advertised.",7,0,0,3 January 2004
Van Helsing," '...I'm just a friar; I can curse all i want...damnit.'
","Just saw it tonight..  and you don't get much more than you'd expect.  Which is good in most ways.  Hugh Jackman is perfect for the role. 
The bads:  some of the accents are terribly overdone and/or way out of place.  They changed the dracula story slightly (not on the original Vlad the Impaler, at least not quite... the guys name was Vlad, though) The dialog from the 'brides' was mostly TERRIBLE.  But hey, they're she-devils, so what...  I could be (more of?) an obsessive critic and take the point of watching a movie out films, but I won't.  I only mention those cons because they really got my attention.  Others may not mind the accents...The rest, even the excessive swinging from ropes, (plenty of 'yeah right!' but big deal... the whole 'Dracula/Frankenstein/Wolfman plot is a whole bit of that, isn't it?  ..so no use complaining) was good fun.  A good mix between Indiana Jones and the classic supernaturals, as well as some humour. At first when I saw that werewolves and Dr. Frankenstein were going to be in this I groaned, but they were written into the plot fairly well.Overall... a B+.",Null,0,0,12 May 2004
The Last Samurai," Epic
","A wonderful movie.Comparable  to Gladiator.  Not just because of the music.  The score was definitely status quo Hans Zimmer, which is great, but you could tell it was him.  Nevertheless he was the right composer for the job.As for the film, a fantastic performance was made by Watanabe.  Cruise as well, but overshadowed by his co-star, if you ask me.  I found the whole movie fascinating and filled with feeling.The battle scenes were quite well done... seemed realistic enough for me. Not quite the grandeur some other film battles, but very effective nonetheless.The historical accuracy of the film I can't comment on, because I have no idea.A solid 9/10.",9,1,2,3 January 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A good and unique movie.
","First off, i've never read the original book.  I am led to believe that in terms of sequence of events and characters this film is quite close to it. 
The romantic theme and overtone is completely new, (apparently) however, and while that's a huge change, i rather enjoyed it as it made Dracula, or Prince Vlad, more of a tragic villain.  Of course, the gruesome details of the historical Vlad III, whom, (although never ACTUALLY stated in the book OR movie, i don't think) the supernatural Dracula is undeniably based on, were largely ignored or only lightly touched upon in this movie; but I think that's more so you can actually empathize with the antagonist. 
Great performances by Oldman and Hopkins.  The rest of the cast wasn't bad... although i do think Reeves was miscast...Interesting directing style and cinematography, too.  Sometimes, however i didn't exactly know what was going on, and i think that was just a symptom of the 'artistic' efforts of the filmmakers.  If i were to pick a definite weakness of the film that'd be it.  On the upside, however, that 'weakness' leaves much of the film, including the ending, very up for interpretation to the viewer, which is kind of nice.  Some of the 'tools' like the superimposition used very often in the film were very effective.All in all, the movie is appropriately creepy most of the time, there's a good link between the bloodlust and pure lust, and the love story is a first in Dracula movies, i think, which is nicely creative.A definite classic.",Null,0,1,19 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the entire saga
","Hands down.(spoilers) It's still a StarWars flick, and I am a fan of the series, doubtless, so I excuse the impossibilities.This movie had all we needed... a very human flaw that led to a good heart being twisted, and how that kid and teenager became such a badass. The end of the movie wasn't happy, and it shouldn't have been. Lucas had a tough job ahead of him: ending the movie with appropriate satisfaction AND gloom, and he did it.There was far more real emotion in this movie than perhaps any other. Maybe rivaled by Empire, although up til now Jedi was my favourite.The performances were all quite good. On par with any Star Wars acting. Let's be clear: the original trilogy was nothing that great... I loved them, sure, but critically/artistically/dialog- and acting-wise: no better than the new trilogy.Anyway, I digress. This film witnesses Anakins cross to the Dark Side, and i loved how it was done because he always thought he was doing the right thing, for the republic and/or the woman he loved, for example. He began his descent with remorse, ('What have i done?') and gradually totally 'seduced' by the Dark Side (sorry) It was all very human; you could, if not relate, understand the emotion behind it - the desperation.All of this builds up to a sad bunch of scenes of the Jedi being hunted down and then a fantastic climax in the film where the heavyweights do battle, all to an incredible John Williams score.This movie was a step up in maturity from the original trilogy, which is what was needed in this new trilogy as a whole (and unfortunately didn't happen until now) So i consider this redemption of sorts, because, yes, despite being good star wars movies Ep1 and 2 were too lighthearted - their only real flaws in comparison to the OT. DEFINITELY worth the money and trip to the cinema!!",9,2,5,14 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," nearly flawless
","minor spoilersI'm a ring nut, let's just make that clear. This film, even more so than the other two, from a critical standpoint is a true masterpiece; an uncanny achievement in film-making.The music, the costumes, the art direction and sets, the acting, the passion... all come together in a brilliant package that does the great novel justice.Of course it's not totally perfect... some might complain about the spirit army being 'ghoulish' or what have you. My only two critical quips would be the absence of Saruman (and having seen the added scene in the extended cut, truly a shame it was cut) and how exactly Denethor died... he should have stayed in the pyre if you ask me, not jump off a half mile cliff. Minor.The acting: superb. True camaraderie shines through each of the performing artists which makes their performances all the more believable. The effects make a movie of this scale so believable you're not sure when you're looking at a effects shot or not. It's practically seamless. From and entertainment as well as artistic standpoint, this movie is NOT to be missed. Just watch the first two parts, first.",10,1,2,14 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Unbelievable (minor spoiler)
","I'll make this short. For both other films, I found myself being very critical and not crazy over them until I saw them more... and I liked them more and more.  I have only seen this film once, and already I love it more than the others.  It's a near-perfect finale.The performances, the scope of the story, the emotions, the wonderful themes of loyalty and good vs evil, and more, combine to make a masterpiece.Having read the books and being a huge fan, sometimes it's hard not to be too critical, but with this film I didn't find myself questioning the screenwriting or direction at all... or the effects.My only gripe I think is how Denethor is handled.  This is a common gripe i think and let's face it... if some details had to be cut, which they did, he was what had to go. But to add to that, what I think SHOULD have in fact been cut was the jumping off the cliff in flames...Unnecessary and kinda goofy.  Running further into the tomb or whatever it was would have been plenty, just as if not more dramatic, and more like the book.So, even with any of my gripes included, this movie rocked.  A full Four Stars.  If this doesn't clean up at the Academy...",10,0,1,21 December 2003
