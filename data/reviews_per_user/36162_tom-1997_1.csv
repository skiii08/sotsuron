Despicable Me 2," What a disaster!
","Catchy headline, hey, but I could not look at it for 1/3 at the time. So it took me 3 sessions to get through this horrible sequence.I've watched it, but it wasn't as pleasant and fun to watch like part 1.Gru needs to be a villain, not a nice guy, it doesn't suit him. It looks hopeless.The first one had some black humor in it, this one doesn't. It's all too....sweet.The rating in IMDb is certainly not right in my opinion, I don't understand it.Waste of my time.",3,2,4,2 November 2013
