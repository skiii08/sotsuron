Scarface," Really weird that I can't like this movie
","Everyone and their yokel stoner buddy is going to vote against me here, but outside of good acting, awesome scenes here and there, and memorable 'cheesy' lines this version of Scarface simply does not hold a shadow to other so-called 'great' mobster cinema.A few of my favorite movies are: Once Upon a Time in America, Little Caesar, and the original Scarface. AS a kid, I was obsessed with the Untouchables television series too, never missed an episode. But, I have never liked this movie! The reason I don't like this is due to the way the main character is presented. All I see in this version's mobster character is some murderous sicko whom is in love with his sister, Gina (Mastrantonio). Then throughout the movie, Tony Montana (Pacino) makes one dumb decision after another because he thinks he's 'too big' for the world and doesn't have to listen to 'nobody.' Montana is inevitably gunned down for his decisions in the famous 'say hello to my little friend' scene. Now I'll go back and break down the plot points of this movie so that hopefully someone else in this world will see my reasoning as to why this movie is no good and overrated:Small mobster rises to power. Everyone does cocaine. People die. The main character and his friends kill some more people and have fornication with lots of women. The mobsters do more drugs.Small guy becomes big mobster and kills his loyal friend (Bauer) for making a move on Gina, then finds that he didn't just kill his best friend, but his now brother-in-law. Sister; Gina sees that her brother is in love with her. Tony does more coke and IT hits the fan.Small-big mobster is gunned down and takes almost everyone with him. Then the movie ends like a Shakespearean tragedy, only with more bullets.So here's a guy into incest, into drug addiction, who is paranoid and he is burdened by a Neapolitan complex too. And I won't even touch on how he makes Colombians look either, but I will mention that the original idea of Scarface was a modern day Robin Hood born and second generation America, who is sucked into the wrong type of life. This character was meant to me based on mostly the life of Al Capone. Montana was only similar on the surface, while Camonte from the 1932 original played by Paul Muni was clearly based on Capone. This does not mean to that for me to be a satisfied viewer I had to see a total remake word-for-word. But there are some things you don't twist such as real facts about a character from a book. Especially when the facts are based on a real person. When that is done, it's practically distorting history. Example: say that they made a movie about Sigmund Freud, without pointing out that someone tried to in 1984. The father of psychology comes up with many concepts. The ideas inspire others such as Jung and Adler to take the inspirational concepts and make them into psychiatry legend. Before this one Jewish man used his 'theories' to make the human mind a more comfortable place, the cranium was simply a mystery that no one would touch. Then, instead of making a movie like that, someone, let's call the writer Olive Stoner, decides to make a movie about a man who was in love with his mother, robbed rich women based on 'oddball' theories that his equals mocked, and the little man snorted cocaine all the live long day and was rude to everyone around him while demanding individuals refer to him as 'Genius' or Dr. Freud. Stoner throws in a few catchy lines, some Hollywood eye-candy, two tommy-guns, and then calls it a day. The movie makes millions, kids buy the action figures, and everyone is happy, right? No. To write a character, you need more than a scar on a face, you need to show the other side of his face too and the freaking backside. When playing with a character that someone else created, you can't rip it apart and make 'em something else entirely while keeping the title 'Mob' in your idea.So Stone's adaptation of this character was overrated by the public. Now, the character Camonte in the original was not a simple guy that you could describe as 'just this' and as 'just that.' There was a lot to that mobster, in fact the writer Ben Hecht studied and analyzed real mobsters for the film and even had real historical moments within based on Al Capone's life. Plus, unlike Stone, Hecht actually read the book Scarface that Armitage Trail wrote in 1929 and he worked with the writer. Montana on the other hand was two-dimensional and clearly based on a rewritten screenplay of the 1932 film.",3,6,11,29 November 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Likes and dislikes of this one
","Slight Spoilers, too minor to matter What I didn't like: In the beginning, Alice becomes normal, if I want a movie about a normal chick fighting zombies, I'll watch Strippers VS. Zombies a.k.a. Zombies, Zombies, Zombies or Zombieland or most other zombie movies that aren't this. I expect to see a superhuman Alice kickin' zombie butt with her normal buddies helping her out. Alas, she is now a normal human fighting zombies. I also felt like the middle was a little pointless and there are several inconsistencies such as one person retaining their memory right away while another takes throughout the film to retain their memory - and that among other things such as the predictable dialogue and all the 'it's been done moments' those things made the film a little sloppy.What I liked: Although she is normal, Alice can still kick butt. Only, she is clearly weaker. It is evident that they are going for a character who has flaws so that the viewer can relate and some girls can aspire to be like, while dudes aspire to shag. The dynamic between the other characters and their relationships were pretty believable, however, some moments were ha ha funny when they were meant to be cool: Claire stopping to pose in the middle of a fight for instance. I liked the addition of Chris too and the way he is introduced. There is also more mystery and bigger and stronger enemies.Like the others: this is cheesy, has a well based, simple plot with likable characters. If you can get past the fact that the main bad guy in this one is basically Neo from the Matrix, and enjoyed the other films, you'll probably like this one too. I know that I rated it high, but that is because it had everything that I expected. I am looking forward to seeing RE5, which should happen, with how it ended.",9,2,6,31 October 2010
Match Point," 3 stars
","For me to like a movie I have to like the main character. I usually like Woody Allen movies also and was surprised at my disgust for this film. Here are 3 reasons: 1. The main character was a cheating, lying, manipulating, murdering sack of crap with no appealing characteristics.2. The movie was misleading. Was it a romance? Was it a comedy? Was it a drama? It was none of the above... it wasn't even a mystery. It was simply about a cheating, lying, manipulating, murdering sack of crap with no appealing characteristics. 3. Skip this one if you haven't seen the movie: The cops didn't do their job. For those of you who saw this, ask yourself... why didn't the police ask the girls friend from work what Nola's plans were before she was killed? And who she was going to meet? Why have the scene with her co-worker unless that had a purpose? Why have the cop solve the crime in his dream and then not follow up? Why have the speech at the beginning of the movie about the ball going over the net, then showing the guy miss the metaphoric net near the end, only to get away with the crime anyways? Life may not be fair, and perhaps the reason Allen made this was to articulate just that. However, in real life this would not have happened. It is every cops job to not leave loose ends, and the poorly written cops in this could not seem to do just that. That is bad writing. The only good thing about this movie was how great Scarlett Johansson looked. Before seeing this I didn't get why all my friends thought she was so hot and talented. She really shined.",3,3,5,29 April 2009
No Country for Old Men," Not close to copper!
","No spoilers here Until the last half hour this looked like possibly one of the greatest films ever made. Then, the storm came and washed that idea away for me. I understood the symbolism of evil and all. But, for a movie that tried to be realistic, it failed to do so. For one thing it had some under qualified rambling sheriff played by Jones chasing the antagonist he barley tried, gave up fast, and mostly sipped on coffee. The psycho killed several along his journey and yet no one contacted the FBI which is protocol for escaped serial killers.We get it Coen's; old people don't get it and neither should you... bleh!The antagonist/ protagonist was chasing this hunter that found a bunch of money next to some dead bodies. They never explain how he knows about the money in the first place or (aside for one instance), how he finds people so easily but yet he just magically does. Next, Woody enters the movie for apparently no reason and while doing a great job at it he had a totally pointless role. You'll probably join the herds of others that liked this because that's what people do these days, they accept crap and smile at it as though it's gold. This doesn't come close to copper! P.S. I didn't like Fargo either",1,38,63,1 January 2008
Avatar," Okay for propaganda
","Whether you agree or not, James Cameron has a very distorted view on what the American military is like. He has probably watched Full Metal Jacket, The Last of the Mohicans, and Fern Gully too many times too.The bad guys in the film were not American military but rather something that a liberal extremist conjured up to make a point on something that he clearly does not understand. Avatar would have been a five star, if the anti-military propaganda was taken out. He could have just gone with a local enemy on the planet, something original. Everyone and their grandma has mentioned the fxs and it is because they were amazing. If one were to look at the story and ignore the distorted view on the American military than this would be a well written one with a great cast of actors yet underdeveloped. Someone please tell James Cameron that if he hates American policy so much that he would make up stuff against our fine military than he can move to France with Johnny Depp.",6,1,4,27 May 2010
The Reader," This glorifies nazi's!
","I give a lot away so you might want to read the next one.I heard great things about this from some friends... then after viewing: realized that my friends are a little antisemitic. Here's a summarized premise: A young law student runs into a forty something year old sometime after the Holocaust. They fall in love. He finds out that she's illiterate so he starts to read to her. Fast forward a bit, she's on trial...responsible for over 300 deaths during the Holocaust. At the ending of the trail the young law student weeps when his lover is sentenced to a lifetime of imprisonment. The worst part of this scene is that the mood attempts to actually try and get the viewer to feel for this illiterate nazi! Years go by and she is released from prison... yeah, they apparently just let some of them free after awhile. Anyways she can read now: how great for her... who cares she's a freaking nazi! The fact that there was a movie created to get people to feel something for these people who were truly scum of the earth is repulsive. It attempts to also send a message that 'reading is good.' However, that is just a shelled message to promote biased opinions in favor of nazi's, explaining that they had feelings and were people. Do you really care if some nazi learned to read while she was in jail? Did I mention that she had the Jews read to her and then she would send them off to die? The only good parts about this movie were the reminders that when nazi's were imprisoned they too were given numbers... and that many of them took their own lives because they weren't strong enough in the end to live with what they did. Too bad they weren't all put in gas chambers instead so that the world today could call it a little poetic justice. If this still sounds interesting than watch the stupid thing. Next you can give ten stars to the one about the child molesting blind man",1,10,37,15 April 2009
