Scarface," THE classic gangster movie
","this movie is the classic gangster movie, the one all the others imitate. it's quite entertaining and very well done, but the violence and gloominess gets on your nerves after a while. again, i'd like to say that the performance of the actors is very convincing. the movie clearly attains its objective perfectly: it shows the horror and paranoia that accompanies the life of gangsters and drug dealers. i recommend it even to the people who don't like the genre for it is very informative as well ass disturbing. the only downside is that it's pretty long...or at least it felt long :P not because it's boring but because it's quite dark and pessimistic.",7,0,2,3 September 2011
American Beauty," the madness of suburbia
","where shall i start? this movie is one of the best i've seen not because it's super hilarious or exciting or sad, but because it's so puzzling. each character is in himself/herself a mystery. indeed, the depth of each of the characters is astounding.also this movie is FULL of symbols, it's an analyst/psychologist's dream! the red door, the roses... each of the main character has a complex which is really interesting from the autistic withdrawal of the neighbor to the hysteria and control-freakness of the mother to the depression and then snapping of the father. i kept thinking about this movie hours after watching it and would gladly watch it again! this should be seen with another person because, i'm telling you, you'll want to discuss this masterpiece avidly after you've seen it!",9,0,1,3 September 2011
