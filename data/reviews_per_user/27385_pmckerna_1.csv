The Blair Witch Project," C***!!!!
","I've seen many a film that's been overhyped.  It usually results in a certain degree of disappointment,  but more often than not these films do have some level of quality.   However,  I feel totally cheated having gone to see 'The Blair Witch Project' last night, only to conclude that it was the dullest film I've seen in a long time.   Did I miss something?   Where were the scary parts? What was the point of watching 78 mins of jerky footage of 3 dumb students plodding through the woods, only to have them eventually go into an old house, hear a scream, run upstairs, run downstairs, see a figure facing the wall, then be confronted with the end credits??!!!!!    Nothing happened!!  I sat through this boring affair and literally NOTHING HAPPENED!!! I could've stayed at home and watched my houseplants grow for better entertainment value!!!How this film has been compared to classics like 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen' is beyond me.   I also notice that it has been receiving high scores from other IMDb users - can someone explain what I missed here???",1,2,3,30 October 1999
