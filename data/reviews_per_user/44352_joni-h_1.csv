Ghost," Love Demi
","The imaginative idea of writing a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually for one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. His movie Always(1989) had its visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with action-based expectations. Yet, Always was lack of the sense of romance, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline of the Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.However, Ghost accomplished of what 'Always' tried and failed. There were indelible moments in Ghost, which were lessons to whom wants to be loved. It is scraped in our memory how Molly and Sam kept their thoughts off each others' feelings, that taught us: 'Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts'. On this account, they never called off their faith on believing to last endlessly together. There were also indelible scenes in Ghost, where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is eternal.I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: 'I will never forget the first time you kissed me, the next would be the end of my life' Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss of all time. MTV had honored this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in a movie of the last decade of the 20th century. Superimposing that, the scenes that Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only; are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",7,1,1,4 February 2012
