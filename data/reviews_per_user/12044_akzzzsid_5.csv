Iron Man 3," Don't expect too much.You would not get it
","For someone like my brother (7 years old),this movie would be his favorite .But for people like me who likes and loves to watch movies which has a strong story to hold it,this movie did not suit my expectations .i don't know why is that.Maybe people like me are expecting more 'DARK' movies after the recent Batman movie. Watching this movie does n't waste your money.Because it is n't that boring.If you are expecting action and good visuals,go and see 'the dark knight rises',because iron man does not have enough to cope up with dark knight!!!!!!If you are expecting Robert Drowney Jr. in iron man,then you got the right movie to watch.",7,0,2,22 September 2013
Jurassic World," Not getting that nostalgia.But Good.Well Done
","Jurassic World delivers a not-so-scary, but an entertaining theme of dinosaurs.The film tries hard to deliver an epic feel.But since the prequels were directed by Steven Spielberg,you gotta give a chance for this director.Chris Pratt delivers an excellent performance in this film as a dinosaur trainer(?).Visual effects are to be appreciated.The originality is well depicted, thanks to Universal Studios and Legendary.The film throws a hint of the upcoming sequels as it is clearly provided.All together, the film can be used to create a wow feeling in kids and fun feeling for adults.The story line could've been better.And some roles were unnecessary.Irfan Khan delivers a cool yet a shady character for his standards.",8,6,20,14 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Marvel is tricking their fans..
","Avengers:Age of Ultron brought in a lot of hype. Action packed figures, lot of TV Spots, leaks, and all stuff that made me think 'Oh, looks like this is gonna be great.'Watched and felt like downloading an illegal print was way much better than spending money and watching this movie. There are moments of 'Wow' and 'Lol' and ' Oh No'. But that's not enough for a movie. If Marvel thinks that putting in some great VFX and graphics would make people like the movie,they are so wrong. Individual performances are to be appreciated. Especially Aaron Taylor Johnson,Elizabeth Olsen,Paul Bettany and last but not the least, James Spader. At a point you would believe that this movie is going to be so awesome.But then your expectations would fall off when you realize that you had been tricked by the amazingly created complex visual effects that would put powder in your eyes and stop you from going out of the theater. The only scene that was outstanding was the unexpected arrival of a special character that would soon be playing a big part in the upcoming phase 3 of Marvel films. Looks like Joss Whedon needs to take rest because all his superhero films are becoming something of a similar candy wrapped in different wrappers.",5,4,10,3 May 2015
Thor: The Dark World," Awesome Movie!!!!
","Just seeing the trailer of Thor 2 made me rethink my decision of seeing this film.But it was all in vain.It really was an awesome film.The moments when i cursed Loki and the moments i loved him was the most awesome. Natalie port man was the main part of the film.All the roles were equally distributed in such a way that no one was seen less and no one was given more importance.So if there is anyone who has been reading this review, i have to say just one thing.Shut down whatever you are using and rush to the nearest theater. I am telling u again folks, go watch the movie.N.B:go out of the theater only after you have seen till the end of the credits.Marvel is up with their usual end scenes.",9,3,8,24 November 2013
The Martian," Matt Damon delivers an outstanding performance of his lifetime
","There was so much buzz going on about the Martian in the internet for the past week. These commotions made me book the ticket for the first show, first day. And it did not disappoint me. The Martian delivers a strong message that willpower can even defeat Mars. Ridley Scott, has developed the movie at a very intense emotional level that we forget to laugh at the jokes sometimes due to the desperate condition of the Martian.Matt Damon delivers the performance of his lifetime as the Protagonist of the movie. He pulls of the character so intensely that we fall in love with the character that whenever he suffers from a tragedy, the audience gets disturbed too. Donald Glover brings in some unexpected comedy that puts up a smile in the face of audience. The rest of the cast has delivered an excellent performance regardless of how big/small their role is.Visual Effects is mind blowing in all the way. This film cannot be compared to Gravity as both films tells stories of people stranded at entirely different situations.The film is excellent. It's an inspiring film of hope, willpower and science..",8,2,59,2 October 2015
