Marie Antoinette," Yikes!
","Wow, where do I start? Simply stated, the marriage of 18th century France and 20th century eighties crap-rock was embarrassingly painful. Dunst, Molly Shannon and Rip Torn lent the picture a general tone of silly 'unbelieveableness' (yeah, I make up stuff too) this picture was like Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton dropped acid and said 'Oh my dog, I just had an idea. Let's totally make a movie about that France chick that got her head cut off in France like 500 years ago'. At any rate, the blame rests at the feet of the douche-bag that green-lighted this abomination. This movie was lazy, trite and jaw-droppingly agonizing. In short, I'm glad this movie sucks so badly because it shows how vapid, insignificant and worthless Hollywood has become. Hopefully someone will rediscover the lost art of movie making.",1,11,19,3 April 2008
