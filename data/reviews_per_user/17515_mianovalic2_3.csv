Iron Man 3," Not perfect,but very well made.
","I was very surprised with people criticizing this movie at first, because of the Mandarin twist many people are saying it wasn't as good as they expected it, well we all have different opinions, but to criticize entire movie because of the villain twist which actually fits the movie way better or simply not liking it is somehow in my opinion...well, screams a person never pleased with anything and is very pessimistic and as well as much as I hate to say it didn't ''get'' this movie. *SPOILER ALERT* Let's start off by Tony's panic attacks, considering that in the comics he struggled with alcohol for the younger audience it is way better to make him simply have anxiety issues other than let them see a hot mess drunk Stark, and oh well, he's a normal man, New York left a mark on him, it's understandable. The reason why his suits were a lot ''weaker'' is because they were prototypes, the original 7 or 8 suits he has were way stronger but they couldn't get attached to his body whenever he calls them and didn't have the new special features that he gave these new suits, he didn't yet perfect these suits and do every little detail right when he got attacked, when his house got destroyed the suits we know and see were also destroyed, but the House Protocol was this perfect back up plan he saved for the big moment, he saved it for the moment he will need them the most and that IS to save the president, if he used the protocol straight away when they attacked his house it wouldn't make any sense. Now the villain, as much as I know about the real Mandarin from the comic books, he just in my opinion wouldn't fit in this movie, still they portrayed him as a lunatic terrorist, and no matter how intimidating he looks, he's just another terrorist, and Tony has fought them in the first Iron Man, so this wouldn't be that big of a problem he would find his location and find a way to kill him, Killian is different, his problem with Tony is more on a personal level, and look at it this way, the man has learned how to ''upgrade'' humans DNA, and we all have seen that while it's not perfectly upgraded, after becoming extremist it is very hard to defeat it. This was the first time the villain actually was maybe smarter than Tony, this was the first time Tony had to show off his skills outside of the suit, this was the first time I wasn't so sure will he win at the end, and in my opinion that is what makes this movie very well put all together, finally we see Tony Stark is not invincible, he isn't perfect, he isn't a non emotional son of a bitch that only cares about himself, he takes risks, he makes plans years ahead, and well, his suits are not a distraction or a hobby. His suits are him,he IS Ironman. CGI was incredible, every action scene was well done, the ending made up for few plot holes which every movie has. 9/10",9,15,23,23 November 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," One of the best if not THE best Marvel movie to date!
","The first movie was decent, but The Winter Soldier stands on it's own. I applaud the Russo brothers for doing what they did to this movie, Captain America was kinda like an underdog in Marvel's The Avengers, but this is everything Captain America movie should be like! The Cap that kicks ass and fights for his country, a good man who hasn't change a bit since he got the serum, a man that might be out of time but is adapting very well! The plot,the CGI, the acting everything was outstanding, but what I mostly was surprised by were the action fight scenes, the choreography's were excellent, these scenes put to shame many other superhero movies and their fight scenes. What also was impressing is that there was plot behind every single one, which is not happening that much in nowadays movies. Whoever thought Marvel movies couldn't get any better, well think again. Because this is the top!",10,0,1,23 November 2014
Interstellar," Brilliant movie, but not for everyone.
","People that will complain about this movie, or call it ''boring'' and give it under 5 ratings simply didn't understand it, neither did they actually pay attention and this is possibly simply not a movie for their taste or them in general ( considering this is a science fiction movie ). Everything about Interstellar makes you question, how much do we actually know about space? What is possible and what isn't? I believe this movie has very small plot holes, nothing unforgivable, also visual effects are done very well, my only complain is that space and those other planets could have been different maybe more imagination put into it, waves and clouds looking way too, may I say basic? Well, since we don't know what is out there, specially so far away, Nolan could have used more imagination, but whatever, Saturn as well wasn't shot well, I felt like it was a Windows background that they used, however everything else was done brilliantly! The books scene at the end gives a lot of ''Inception'' feelings, plot is well done and many plot twists turned out better than I expected them to. I think the movie lives up to it's hype, I am glad it wasn't too much like ''Avatar'' even though I loved it, I hoped for a better plot, which Interstellar has. A great movie worthy of watching but you have to pay attention to everything and not text someone while watching!",10,1,8,26 November 2014
