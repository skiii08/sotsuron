Sucker Punch," Great Concept, Shaky Execution
","I really don't know what to think of this movie, but based on gut instinct I'd say I liked it. Just wasn't really what I was expecting. It was a lot more dark and depressing than I expected or was led to believe. That's not a bad thing, but it definitely took me by surprise. It's one of those movies where every little thing means something or is symbolic. Some are so obvious it's cringe-worthy, and others that you really have to think about.I'm glad there was a fair share of character development to go along with all the action. Really got invested in their stories which was nice. Babydoll, Sweet Pea, and Rocket were the real leads. Amber and Blondie have a few nice moments, but mostly stood around unfortunately. Blue was just repulsive. Acting was strong. The supporting cast, especially Jena Malone and Abbie Cornish, stood out the most. Vanessa Hudgens surprised me. Emily Browning wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, but was still pretty good.The action scenes were pretty hit or miss. There was one that was one of the best I've seen on film, another that was just plain awful, and the others were must 'meh'. Very style-ish. Sometimes a little TOO much style though.So yeah, Sucker Punch is good. The concept is excellent, there's a lot to think about, some good characters.... I just wish the execution was a little bit stronger.",7,4,15,24 March 2011
