Alien 3," Bad compared to the previous parts
","Alien 3 is bad compared to the previous movies(Alien and Aliens) but still it's an OK movie. The worst part of the movie is probably the beginning. They show us some random frames of a xenomorph 'walking' round the spaceship. And then suddenly we see a planet and understand that the ship has crashed on this planet. Now the question is - What happened? What was the xenomorph doing on the ship? Why did the ship crash? And of course the answer isn't revealed.Another thing worth mentioning is the part when Ripley learns that Newt had died. In Aliens we saw how strong is the relationship between Newt and Ripley and now when Newt is dead, Ripley just accepts it and goes on. All the parent-child relationship we saw in Aliens is gone. Everything else is alright. The movie has some action. There are some interesting events, like the part when Ripley learns that she's carrying an alien in her womb. But still the strange beginning and the way Ripley accepts Newt's death show that the writer and the director decided to skip the 'important' parts and leave the movie with some holes in it just so they can put more action in the movie.",7,3,8,6 March 2017
Alien: Resurrection," The worst Alien movie ever made
","First of all I want to state that I don't think that this movie is as bad as everyone is saying. It is a decent 90's sci-fi action movie. Of course, if you compare it to the previous Alien movies it really seems like a bad movie. Alien was a masterpiece that defined a whole genre, Aliens was a great action, Alien 3 was also a quite good horror (not a popular opinion) and then there's Alien: Resurrection. It is neither a horror, nor an action movie, it's some sort of a mix between this two genres and that just doesn't seem to work right for an Alien movie.Even though Alien: Resurrection is a bad Alien movie it is, as I already stated, a decent action movie. A simple plot and script, filled with puns and medicore jokes, which is typical for most action flicks from the 90's. So, if you ignore the previous movies and watch it as an independent film it won't seem that bad. But there are still a few things that completely destroyed the Alien franchise and made me not enjoy this movie.First, the Alien-human hybrid. I don't know who came up with this idea but it was awful. They tried to make something original and they failed miserably.The second thing that destroyed this movie for me is the whole idea for Ripley being cloned. It just shows that the only purpose of Alien:Resurrection is to continue milking the franchise, even though it died with Alien 3.I can go on and point more reasons why this movie ruined the Alien anthology. But I'll stop here and just say that Alien: Resurrection is another example of how too much sequels can destroy even the best franchise.",5,5,10,8 January 2019
12 Angry Men," A real classic with great dialogues
",There's not much that can be said about 12 Angry Men apart from it being a very well made movie. It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better. I personally think that if they had shot this movie form different angles it would've looked more intriguing and intense. But still as I already said 12 Angry Men has a very well written script and that's enough for it to be called a good movie.,8,2,4,17 January 2019
Batman Returns," Michael Keaton is back and his Batman is worse than ever
","I'm quite amazed by the fact that so many people enjoy this movie and that there're even people out there who call it a masterpiece. It's nothing more than an average or even below average movie.Probably the only thing that this movie did good is the portrayal of the Penguin. Danny Devito is a great actor and surely did an excellent job. His make up is also on point and very well made. But everything else is just awful.I'm going to skip the criticism of Michael Keaton's Batman because it is without doubt the worst portrayal of the Batman so far. It's not only the witless facial expressions that he makes, but also the robotic like movements that make the Batman seem more like a tree rather than a fighter.The script is a bit better than the one in Batman(1989) but still requires lots of improvement. As for the plot, all I can say is that it is nothing special and unoriginal.",4,6,31,7 January 2019
Alien," The start of a great anthology
",Alien has a slow and mysterious beginning. It starts like nothing special - some people eating and talking on a space ship. But it gets more intense when they detect an unknown planet and land on it so they can explore it. The audience has to wait more than 1 hour to see the thing they paid for - the xenomorph. And this waiting makes its emergence one of the greatest moments in the cinematic history. Still we see the xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes the alien more mysterious and gives the movie a horror character. And of course another reason we see the xenomorph so rarely is because the CGI wasn't very well developed at that time and it was pretty hard to make the alien's appearance. Alien(1979) is a great start for the Alien anthology and even though the bad CGI it's the best movie in the whole anthology. The movie is worth watching.,9,5,8,14 February 2017
Interstellar," A science fiction movie that is definitely worth watching
","A great science fiction movie, with an amazing plot and of course a very talented director. No one can deny Nolan's talent, all his movies are well made and Interstellar is one of his best works. Some people say that the plot of Interstellar is confusing but I don't think so (maybe because I've watched this movie more than 20 times). Still we can say that it's a bit confusing if you're watching it for the first time but don't worry it won't be confusing after the second or the third watch.Something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something explodes in space, there is no sound, simply because of the vacuum. In many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of explosion, gun fire,etc in space, which makes it look less realistic. But in Interstellar every single thing is physically correct, because Nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie realistic.Interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it different from the other science fiction movies. It shows us the pain of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new home for the mankind.Interstellar is an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching.",9,3,6,17 February 2017
Aliens," A great action movie that shows us how powerful is the relationship between the child and the parent
","Aliens is a bit different than the first Alien movie, it has more action and it has lost its mysterious, horror character. The movie provides us with great action scenes, we see hundreds of xenomorphs and even their queen in the end of the movie. If we compare it to the other movies from the Alien anthology we'll see that this one has the most action. The movie also shows us a relationship between two of the characters - Ripley and Newt. Ripley has recently found out that her daughter has died while she was in hyper sleep. This loss is very painful for her and when she meets the little girl Newt she manages to establish a parent - child relationship with her. Ripely protects the girl, even though she's not her biological daughter. And in the end when she goes back to save Newt we can see how powerful a mother can be when she has to protect her child.The movie provides us many action and emotional scenes. And I can say that it's as good as the first one.",9,4,8,15 February 2017
A Quiet Place," If they hear you fart they won't hunt you, for some reason
","I tried really hard to like this movie but I was unable to and that's not because of bad cinematography, acting or plot. The idea behind A Quiet Place is unique and original and everything else is well made but there is one thing that ruined the movie for me and that's all the plot holes.First of all, it is made clear that even the smallest sound can trigger these monsters. But if that's true how did these people survive. There are numerous sounds that the human organs make uncontrollably. So everyone would be dead as soon as someone farts or if their stomach makes some noise.Another thing that really bothered me is that these monsters' hearing barrier changes throughout the movie. So they are unable to hear people walking but near the end one of the monsters manages to hear how the boy falls inside the barn that is kilometers away from the house.As for the ending, it was really disappointing. They probably thought it would be cool if the characters find a way to kill the monsters but to be honest an open ending that leaves them in the situation they were before would've been better.There are many plot holes but if you ignore them this movie has a good cinematography and acting. And most importantly an original plot.",6,2,5,23 January 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Extremely overrated
","Over the years I've heard many people saying that this is the greatest sci-fi movie ever made. But in my opinion this movie is nowhere near as great as it's said to be and every time I state this opinion people start telling me that I'm stupid and that I just don't get it. I'm quite sure that this isn't the problem, it's just that the movie is slow in an extremely boring way. I really enjoy slow movies, I'm a big fan of Tarkovsky and he is the director with the slowest movies out there. But 2001: A Space Odyssey is no Tarkovsky, it is just an awful and boring slow movie.I have to admit that the visuals are great considering that this movie was made in 1968 and I actually think that this is the reason why it got so popular. But if you take away the awesome visual effects there's nothing left.2001: A Space Odyssey is an extremely overrated and boring movie. And by stating that this movie is bad I don't mean to say that Kubric is a bad director, I actually enjoy some of his works but doing slow movies is jusy not his thing.",2,7,17,29 January 2019
A Clockwork Orange," 'Viddy well, little brother. Viddy well.'
","To be honest I'm not a big fan of Kubric as I find some of his movies overrated. But I have to admit that this movie is truly a masterpiece and a classic in both crime and anti utopian geners.There are many things that make this movie so great. The acting is on a very high level and Malcolm Mcdowell gives an outstanding performance. The scrip is well written and the plot is intriguing. I can go on and list many other things that make this movie a masterpiece but probably the most important one is the storytelling. Kubric has shown that he is a good storyteller and this movie proves it undoubtedly.Let's not forget how controversial 'A Clockwork Orange' is. There are many scenes that might seem disturbing to some viewers. But these scenes are of great importance for this movie as they make it more intense and intriguing.It is a controversial movie, indeed. But even though filled with violence and sex, 'A Clockwork Orange' manages to talk about important themes that concern the human society.",9,4,9,5 January 2019
Pulp Fiction," A true Tarantino classic
",Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that not everyone can enjoy. Many people say that it's boring and senseless. It is true that the plot isn't something special but it isn't the plot that makes this movie so unique but the awesome script and great cinematography.Probably one of the greatest things in this movie are the dialogues. The dialogues just like in all other Tarantino movies aren't directly connected with the plot. Take the first dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta. They are talking about how a certain burger is called in France. This and many others dialogues don't have a direct relation with the plot line but their function is to somehow build the characters' personalities.The other thing that makes this movie so unique is the unexpected turn of events. Like in all other Tarantino movies you don't know who they are going to kill next or what is going to happen. The scene where Vincent shoots Marvin in the face is a great example for such unexpected turn of events. This makes the viewer more intrigued and thus makes the whole experience form the movie way better.There isn't much more that can be said about Pulp Fiction. It's not a movie that everyone will enjoy but still deserves to be seen.,9,21,38,25 January 2019
Psycho," A horror classic
",I'm not a fan of Hitchcock's works but I have to admit that I really enjoyed this one. The plot is intriguing and makes you watch the movie with interest till the very end.The cinematography isn't perfect but I'll omit this fact because after all Psycho is from 1960 and no one expects its cinematography to be as good as the one in the movie from the next decades.The acting was good. Of course there are a few scenes with overacting such as the one where Marion gets murdered but that's not of vital importance for the overall acting in the movie.The plot is as I already said intriguing and well thought. It is the greatest thing in this movie and is there probably the only reason why Psycho is considered an all time horror classic.,8,2,7,1 February 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," A must see movie
","It has been argued for years whether this movie deserves its fame or not. Some say that it is overrated and others say that it is the best movie ever made. What I can say is that it is true that this movie is a bit overrated but it still deserves to be called a masterpiece.There is something about The Shawshank Redemption that creates a specific atmosphere and makes you not only watch but experience it. I have read the book and I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie more. The combination of outstanding acting, great directing and well written script makes this movie the masterpiece it is.I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie except for its high place in the IMDB top 250's list. It is an amazing movie but it still doesn't deserve to be called the best as there are many others that are equally good or even better. But still, this movie should be on everyone's list of must watch movies.",9,3,8,10 January 2019
Life," Did I just watch an Alien reboot?
","Life(2017) doesn't show anything new and lacks originality. Watching this movie felt like I was watching an Alien reboot. They bring the alien organism to the station, where it grows and kills everyone - I've already seen that in Alien. They try to kill the alien with a flamethrower - I remember that part from Alien too. So you'll ask is there anything different from the Alien movie and my answer is no. Even the alien looks like a xenomorph, I was very surprised that it didn't have acid instead of blood. The unusual ending is probably the only part, which is not copied from another movie but everything else is (as I already said) copied from Alien.Another problem are the 'tense' parts, where everyone just stay silent and look at each other, like in a movie made by Tarkovsky. There are like 2 or 3 'tense' parts in the movie but somehow these parts make the audience feel annoyed rather than tense.Of course there are some good things in the movie but they're mostly CGI. The ending was one of the good things too, it was different and unusual and surprisingly not copied from Alien.",6,3,8,19 June 2017
The Godfather," A real classic in the crime genre
","There are many mafia movies out there but The Godfather truly stands out among them. And it is not great just because it is one of the first movies in the crime genre but also because of it's great cinematography and outstanding storytelling .If you retell the plot to someone it will sound like it is extremely dull. It's just the story of how a son takes over his father's business. But the way the movie presents this plot (with many betrayals and deaths) makes it great and memorable.The acting is not always good. In some scenes it is extremely bad. Take the scene where Connie starts breaking utensils. The acting in this scene is so bad that when it comes up while I'm watching the movie, I just turn my head away. Of course I should metion that Marlon Brando and Al Pacino do a great job. Their acting is outstanding and deserves the pride it gets.The Godfather is truly a classic in the crime genre that must be on everyone's top movies list.",8,8,14,28 January 2019
