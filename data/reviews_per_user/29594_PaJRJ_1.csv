Resident Evil: Afterlife," What a Bloody Mess - it just makes no sense in spots
","In a post apocalyptic world one might tend to think that basic necessities such as food and water would make it to the top of ones hit list. From the opening Alice clone attack it's obvious that what working class survivors are left are manufacturing ammunition. Lots of ammunition. Lots of magic ammunition that automatically reloads itself.It's obvious that one pair of clones are simply mirror images. A blatant and cheap looking way to save money on the special effects.Also, other than food and water it is obvious the ruby red lipstick and hairspray abound as Milla never looks the slightest bit disheveled. I am a fan of a hot, gun-toting babe looking her finest, nut a lack of lipstick and the occasional smudge would be more realistic.Up next is the aircraft graveyard when Alice goes to Alaska to search for Arcadia. The final two craft are helicopters parked underneath trees. This does not make sense since I have it on good authority that after their 1985-1987 border skirmish trees and helicopter rotors do not get along to this day.And did I mention the lipstick? Ali Larter's Claire character is introduced looking much more normal considering the circumstances and probably badly craves some lipstick. We are shown a device that Alice removes from her cute little tummy that may be important to the plot. Natch no mention is made of it again unless it was film that ended up on the cutting room floor.The feral Claire is tied up and thrown into the back of the plane that is powered by he same automatically fuel reloading technology as the ammo.Did I mention the lipstick? After a particularly unbelievable on the roof plane landing we proceed to the main setting, a prison that a small group of survivors has holed up in. One of the few things that makes sense, Fortified prison walls would be more zombie proof. This prison comes complete with the same magic technology as it still has running water. Miracuously Claire's brother has survived and is being held prisoner in the prison - yet not in a prison cell. By the time of their reunion Claire has cleaned up nicely and has the requisite magic lip coating.In order to get the action going we have the introduction of one huge axe wielding boss zombie. Can't have those pesky survivors stay holed up where it's safe.In a last ditch attempt to improve their chances versus the impending released by Mr. huge axe zombie a failed attempt at procurement of a huge armored vehicle the group and removal of the plane as an option (from the roof that is obviously too small of a runway by the resident evil sleazebag human) the group is forced to take to the sewers to reach Arcadia. By now we know this is a ship that has acquired Time Lord technology and is much larger on the inside than the outside.Resident evil human sleazebag has miraculously survived crashing the plane onto the Arcadia and has teamed up with the over the top uber-villain from the initial Alice clone attack at the beginning.Long story short - good triumphs over evil because it's nicer in one final magic ammunition display and a 'Whoa, I never saw that planting the bomb in the uber villain.s plane' Yes, this is sarcastic.Numerically the rating I give is basically a 1 out of 10. Add another point for Milla just because she's hot. Add another half point for the Ed Woodian laughter and another half point for the, 'Oh well, did you really expect high art?' factor.",3,4,9,9 April 2012
