The Equalizer," What a refreshing action film, one of its kind!
","Saw the trailer few month back in the cinema, got hooked instantly. The movie did not disappoint at all and delivered more than what I expected. This is not your typical Hollywood action flick. Justice is pouring down like rain and it ain't stopping. The fight scenes in the file are refreshing and powerful. The story lines is easy to follow and unique. Some special effects may be somewhat low quality, but the action definitely makes it up for it. Two and half hour does not feel long at all with this film, you will be hooked with the story before you even reaches the end of the film.It deserves to be one of the best action file of the year!",9,2,8,3 October 2014
