Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Insanely Hilarious
","Borat originally got his start on 'Da Ali G Show', quite the funny HBO show starring Sacha Baron Cohen, who also plays Ali G, an English rapper/thug, and a gay television reporter from some European or Asian country. Many at first assumed Borat was a real person, not an actor, but he's exactly the opposite.The plot of this movie is one of the simplest ever, which is one reason why I think it's such a success. Not that it's a bad thing, but you don't have to think deeply about the moral of the film, what's going on, or any deeper meanings the movie might posses. It goes basically like this...Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a Kazakhstan news reporter sent to America with his friend, Azamat, to learn and experience different cultural styles of 'The U S and A' so that Kazakhstan can become more culturally knowledgeable. Simple plot, huh? Borat is originally sent to the Big Apple to fulfill his cultural duties, but stumbles upon a 'Baywatch' collectors book at a garage sale, and sees his true love, Pamela Anderson. Yes, I know, that's a little if not VERY dumb-sounding, but all of this makes that movie absolutely hysterical! Now Borat's journey is set for California, the only place where he can find his true love, Pamela.Along the way, Borat winds up at an Evangelist church, dining with the South's finest (among other things bound to get laughs), taking driving lessons, being deathly terrified of a bed and breakfast, adopting a wild bear, getting hold of a cruddy ice cream truck, and hanging with some new-found Atlanta thugs. These scenes are just some that got laughs from everyone at the theater I attended, there are many more.But, there is one BIG scene that 'takes the cake', beats the rest. I will only say it involves some grossly nude wrestling, that is actually quite disturbing, but in a hilarious way! If you see this movie, you'll know what scene I'm talking about! Everyone I know that has seen this movie agrees that it was the funniest one they have ever seen, especially this scene here. I laughed myself into tears, as did many others. It was such a simple scene, but it was so crazy and absurd that it was extremely funny.So to state it simply: Go see Borat! Funniest film ever! (By the way, that is not just an isolated opinion, MANY critics (newspaper, television, magazine employees) have said this too)",10,2,14,6 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Decent, yet somewhat disappointing
","Upon leaving the theater after seeing 'At World's End,' (AWE) I was left with that 'kinda-sorta-okay' impression. The first two films in this series are truly excellent, and that is one of the various reasons I was so disappointed. I expected to be wowed and pulled into a fast-paced world of action as I was when viewing 'Curse of the Black Pearl' and 'Dead Man's Chest,' but I was bored.Before ever seeing AWE, I had heard there was too little action; not enough sword fights, exciting battles with strange creatures of the sea, etc. I had always thought of myself as one who disliked action in movies, and I just thought of it as filler. However, this series absolutely needs action and those famous sword battles on top of moving objects (like the giant wheel shown in the second film) that we have all come to know and love. Without that needed action, the film unfortunately became dull. And the numerous sappy plots of the film, such as Will's (Orlando Bloom) ordeal with his father as well as Elizabeth's (Keira Knightley) situation with her father, were just not enough to keep the viewer entertained.And that brings me to my next point---all this boring talk about fathers. Nearly every other word out of both Bloom and Knightley's mouth was 'father.' To speak the truth, the movie was mainly about the character of Will Turner talking about his father, and Elizabeth Swann crying over hers.I have never been a Johnny Depp fan until seeing the first film in this series. Depp brings character, humor, and entertainment to the screen. A lot of critics are saying this and I must agree---there was not enough Johnny Depp. He made the first two movies such wonderful films, and with the third missing his presence in too much of the picture, it failed. Depp has a tendency in really any movie to spice things up. I looked forward to seeing Depp because I've noticed he makes otherwise boring scenes just fantastically entertaining. The movie missed a lot due to his lack of appearances.There were also a number of confusing scenes that left many questions unanswered. Instead of focusing on the film, I was stuck trying to determine whether 'it was real or just a dream.' These weirdly baffling scenes distract the viewer from any real significance they actually had. For instance, the first scene involving Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was incredibly strange, although I think the writers were going for more of a 'creative' feel. It is wildly weird, and never explained. Perhaps if there was some sort of explanation, the importance of the scene would have been shown.Even after all the flaws AWE had, I did enjoy some aspects of the film. As always, composer Hans Zimmer brings a wonderful set of songs into the movie, including the easily recognizable 'He's a Pirate,' the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' theme song. The appearance of Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's father was quite interesting also. Richards had supposedly been asked to appear in the series for quite some time, and I am glad he took a part, in my opinion, the perfect part. I would have liked to see more of Richards though, because his part was rather small. The special effects were, as usual, great. With the potential for much more action that was never capitalized on, there could have been plenty more special effects though. But, what was included in the film was substantial.In conclusion, I guess I would say 'At World's End' could have been much better, but we have to deal with what we are given.",6,0,1,8 June 2007
Detroit Rock City," One of the Best Movies...EVER
","When I first watched Detroit Rock City, I absolutely fell in love with the movie. The music is excellent, featuring TONS of great songs from KISS, AC/DC, Sweet, Cheap Trick and more top notch bands. The entire cast acts their roles amazingly, and I really felt each actor/actress fit their part perfectly. To briefly describe the plot of the movie, four high schoolers who are total KISS fanatics purchase tickets to see KISS live in Detroit, but, it's not as easy as that! Without giving away too much, they encounter so many hilarious problems along the way to Detroit that are very entertaining! Plus, Detroit Rock City contains so many laugh out loud lines throughout the whole movie! This movie is great for someone who knows the music and is familiar with KISS, but I'd also recommend it to someone who isn't as familiar with the group. Detroit Rock City is my all time favorite movie, and in my opinion, one of the funniest movies ever!",9,1,4,21 July 2006
