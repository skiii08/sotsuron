The Ring," An unfortunate let-down
","***Spoilers Ahoy!***Fill in the blanks: Our film begins when _________ mysteriously dies as a result of having accidentally stumbled onto a _________ with strange supernatural powers.  It turns out that when the characters see the ________, a female voice then tells them that they have ______ days to live, after which a creepy little girl shows up to usher in their untimely deaths.  The only real way to solve the mystery is to have the main character subject him/herself to the ________, thus putting them in harm's way and the ____ day countdown begins. At the very last minute, our hero discovers that the cause of all the commotion is because the creepy girl was murdered by ________ and just wants her soul set free.Is this the plot line for 'Feardotcom' or for 'The Ring?'  Unfortunately, it's both.  'The Ring' is by far the better of the two films, with superior acting, pacing, effects, and script.  It also tacks on a pretty interesting twist to the 'little girl done wrong' story, which I presume is what will ultimately set this film apart from its cinematic doppelganger.  However the backbone of 'The Ring' is so strikingly similar to 'Feardotcom', that I ultimately felt like I had already seen this flick before, and it sucked. Very, very disappointing.I also felt that the film-makers chose their path too early on.  Four teenagers die in the opening sequence (almost entirely off-screen) as a result of having seen 'the tape' (as it comes to be known).  After some sleuthing, our main character Naomi Watts discovers the tape, watches it, and begins the countdown to her demise lest she solve the mystery.  At this point, we can assume that either she will succeed and live (very probable), or will fail and die, leaving the peripheral characters to pick up the slack (not very probable-this IS American cinema after all).  And that's just it. We know that if anyone is going to die on screen, it has to be Naomi Watts first, and I just didn't believe that was going to happen.  Now, there is the now-obligatory twist at the end, so the audience doesn't go home completely unsatisfied, but the explanation is sketchy and it's too little, way too late.  4/10.",5,0,0,17 October 2002
Signs," You have to ask yourself
","About halfway through M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs,' Mel Gibson's character tries to console his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) by posing this question:  Is he the type of person who sees the signs and believes them to be divine, or is he the type who simply writes them off as coincidence? Mel then raises the stakes a bit by qualifying that the former type will be comforted in knowing that they are not alone, that God is with them regardless of how things turn out.  The latter, however, do not have that comfort, and will live their lives knowing that they are alone.  While Mel's farmer-under-attack probably won't be getting any job offers from Hallmark any time soon, his statements form the core of the film, and ultimately will determine how you the viewer feel when the credits roll.If you are the type of person who plans on going into 'Signs' waiting for this year's greatest suprise ending, then you'll definately get it. Suprise!  There's not one.  What Shyamalan has created is a superb rural science-fiction picture that works terrifically as a summer popcorn thriller, and as arthouse-type discussion fodder.  He gives you a lot of thrills for your buck, and the atmosphere is genuinely creepy throughout. The camera direction is extremely tight, hiding the evils that may (or may not) be lurking just beyond the visibility of the actors and the audience. It's almost as if the viewers are wearing blinders, forcing them to look only where the director wants them to.  Much like and escalating roller-coaster, we know we're about to take a huge plunge but we still can't see anything but the top of the hill.
Interestingly, Shyamalan turns the 'big question' on his own audience. It is either truly brilliant or totally egotistical (probably both) to actually guilt-trip your audience into liking your film.  If you are the type of person who believes what you are shown as intentional displays of the higher power (the film director as God), then you will be rewarded with an enjoyable film experience.  If you choose to disregard the director's intent, and pass pieces of the film off as coincidence or, more 'blasphemously,' as poor sci-fi filmmaking, then you are like the film's hopeless characters, lost and alone.  Most importantly, as you walk away from 'Signs,'ask yourself how many times in the last hour-and-a-half you had to squeeze your date's arm just a little harder for comfort.  This should be the true sign that you have been in a master's hands.",Null,0,1,9 August 2002
