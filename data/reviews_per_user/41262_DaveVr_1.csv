The Blair Witch Project," Good student film, but nothing more
","This movie was exceptionally over-hyped, even more so than Star Wars.  I felt that it was OK for a zero-budget movie made by a couple of film school students, but is certainly not deserving of the lavish praise it has received.  As a movie, it is poorly done in many aspects.  It is very boring at times and poorly paced.  The characters are never developed, so you really don't care what happens to them.  It is more scary than the recent batch of post-modern 'horror' films like Scream, but does not come close to something like The Exorcist.  In fact, I thought that Event Horizon (a terrible movie, btw) was much scarier.  Catch this one on video.",6,0,2,29 July 1999
