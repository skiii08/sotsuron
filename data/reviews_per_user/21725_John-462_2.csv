The Legend of Bagger Vance," Well-done period movie
","If you asked me what subject I would suggest for a period piece, I guess golfing in the Great Depression probably wouldn't have been on my list.But it was on Robert Redford's list, and this Will Smith/Matt Damon golf-o-rama carries itself pretty well through over two hours.Rannulph Junuh (Damon) is the town of Savannah's golfing hero, before being drafted to fight in World War One.  Losing his entire platoon doesn't do his mental health any good though, and he returns to Savannah anonymously after being presumed dead 12 years.  His old girlfriend Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron - aaaaaah) has been waiting and isn't one bit happy that Junuh hasn't written.With me so far? Good.In order to save the family golf course and prove to the town that her fathers' building of it and subsequent suicide weren't in vain, Adele (Charlize - aaaaaaaah) persuades the two top golfers in the country to play against each other. Junuh is reluctantly made to agree to play in the competition.  He's game's no good though, but things start to improve when a mysterious caddy shows up and shows him the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Oh, and golf.Truth be told, my heart sank when Will Smith arrived.  I though he was going to cheapen the movie by lowering it to his fast-talking, joke cracking, streetwise (i.e. usual) style.  However,  he plays the happy-go-lucky Bagger very well; and portrays a character that's easy to believe.  Hard to admit Smith can acutally act. That said however, you never quite get over the fact that this is Will Smith here; it's like watching old Leslie Nielsen movies where he plays serious parts - you're waiting for the joke, and it never comes.Go see this for something paced a little more toward the American south - i.e. a little more slowly.  Don't expect riotous action or fast-n-furious comedy - but this one will make you smile.Special mention: Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus gets a free lollipop for some excellent visual work.  Actor B-List Spotters like me will also get a smile - Lane Smith plays - guess what? - a reporter (From The Earth To The Moon, New Superman etc.).",7,1,3,11 February 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Solid: good story, graceful execution
","Range of performance from actors was on the whole good; Nicolas Cage and John Hurt doing really quite well - although Cage's part had more scope.
Cage's accent was quite believable as English with an Italian lilt. Hurt's, as Greek, was less so; lapsing into pure English occasionally.  The English/German accents were pretty terrible, no points for Patrick Malahide or David Morrissey.  Ranges of the Greek island natives was small, but then, having been occupied by the Italians, they didn't have very much to smile about.All the acting was very good, down to passable.  Points to Cage and Hurt for some great performances as the suave love-struck Italian and rugged, long-suffering Greek father respectively.The story - okay, a group of opera-singing Italian artillerymen is perhaps not the most natural subject, but the boys could definitely sing; Cage's mandolin playing was haunting and thoroughly believable (I can't believe it wasn't him playing it, in fact).  The story is classic love-triangle material, but a war and a twist keep it interesting.The cinematography was excellent, John Toll showing us the lush Greek Cephallonian landscape. However, with scenery as striking as this, Toll could hardly go wrong by just pointing the camera anywhere.  The scenery, already really a character of its own, becomes somewhat more dominant toward the end.Pacing was rather slow for my taste. Some shots lingered a little too long when I was expecting a cut.  General pacing was slow; with the start of the third act being a jarring acceleration into high-gear.  After that the pacing slows down again with a slight bump toward the end.Overall: for someone interested in a solid film, and willing not to bitch about the pacing, this is definitely one to see.  Good story, direction, and cinematography.  If the editor could tighten it up a little, this would be 8/10; otherwise 6.",6,2,3,17 October 2001
