Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Face it, reputation made this film...
","If Phantom Menace were to be an original film, not a sequel, not a prequel, but the first of it's kind, this movie would have been thrashed and trashed as much as Travolta's folly Battlefield Earth. The reputation of Star Wars made this film. I  will not excuse it of it's horrid production however. You can serve a beautiful cuisine with elaborate colors and garnishes, but if it tastes like cardboard, what's it matter?First of all, I can understand that Star Wars as a genre is a silly sci-fi film. Was it meant to be serious? Probably in Lucas' mind but even Mr. Harrison Ford states that maybe someone other than Lucas should be penning the story. Of course the best  interpretation of an idea is the one who thinks of it first. However, George Lucas excels in bringing eye candy to us all. The aliens, the scenery. NOT the story. The dialogue is the prime killer of this film. When I hear Qui-Gon praise Obi-wan that he will one day become a great Jedi Knight, and a much more wiser man one day might I add, after being scolded and led around like a clueless student, I shudder. What has Obi-Wan done in the film that deserves that remark besides an absurd attempt to foreshadow? Maybe that one sword fight in the end? Qui-Gon is the MAIN Jedi of the film. Obi-Wan, well he was there because he had to be there. The Queen, maybe its her character but shes reading lines from cardboard. Padme? I like her, but what's so unique about her? She can shoot guns and dodge guns like her bodyguard? Who needs the bodyguard then if she could do all that. See the end of the film when they try to retake Naboo and you'll see what I'm talking about. Speaking of, I found this absurd as well. If the Queen is the decoy, the bodyguard. She seems to be fit to rule as well. Why would they refer to her, talk to her, in the beginning of the film when NO one but her trusted Council is there. Does Padme not trust her own people? Or is she unfit to rule so they consult with the bodyguard instead.Alot of people loathe Jar-Jar Binks. I don't abhor his character, he's an alien. So, some act peculiar to us standards. However, I do have someone I totally detest in the film. Anakin Skywalker. Why did they envisioned Jake Lloyd as Anakin? So he could play this cute little kid who makes light of every situation and cracks out the lame lines that they give him? I feel so much pity for the dead pilots of the assault on the Trade Federation Controlship. These are, I assume, trained pilots risking their lives to save their planet. Obviously I was terribly mistaken as they were actually saved by this little kid who somehow maneuvers better than any of them shouting out, 'Now this is pod racing!' or the classic 'Let's try spinning, thats a good trick!'. Or how about firing those torpedoes and that disabled the entire controlship. How fragile and flimsy of the aliens that an internal implosion would destroy it. Granted that MIGHT have been its power source or whatever, WHY was it exposed near a docking bay full of ships that can shoot torpedoes? Was that the force guiding young Anakin? Give me a break. Last but not least, the android army. Giving them ranks was, um, for lack of better term retarded. I don't feel like going into why. I will say they are plainly cannon fodder. The Jedi are good, but not the way Qui and Obi displayed that they could disable 20 androids at once. How slow are they? Heaven forbid even in one scene during a heavy fight, an android had its back on Obi-Wan looking like a lost idiot. Any guesses what happens?Star Wars doesn't deserve all the hype, and it shouldn't. The Box-Office says otherwise, but that's what hype gets you, refer to Mission Impossible II please. The accolades will show you what the film is made of. Sure it's full of neat scenery, great special effects, and an impressive score with one extremely annoying Parade song, but what is all that without good dialogue? Phantom Menace may as well be one of the greatest silence films of all time if you hit the Mute button.",2,0,1,23 October 2000
Alien: Resurrection," A sorry ending
","I never liked Joss Whedon and this movie is another example as to why. First off I can not treat this movie as it's own. The series brought us a powerful and memorable heroine and a frightening and memorable villain. You can't separate the films apart. They are forever linked with those characters and thus they are to be scrutinized in comparison between them. Saying that I am sorry Alien Ressurection was made. What made Ripley who she is in the Alien series? Obviously Whedon had no clue whatsoever and went ahead to change her character into this blasphemous Terminator-like hero. I for one didn't like this change. It's because she is human, succumbed to emotions, and most of all AFRAID of the unexpected and the horrific nightmares these creatures wrought upon her that made Ripley... Ripley. Turning her into an Alien is a novelty, and I suppose what they were trying to accomplish was an ironic and cruel twist of fate tossed to her. The thing that has haunted her for so long she becomes. Unfortunately, the performance wasn't convincing and we end up hating this new persona. Blame it on the script.Visually this fourth installment is pretty much what we have been experiencing over and over again with the series. Again, they try to reproduce that claustrophobic experience Aliens gave us with the tight corridors, the running out of time factor, etc. Some of the humor in the movie was unnecessary and bland. The General saluting after destroying an alien, then gets killed by one but not before going through a few gestures which screams comedy, was insulting to the series. I will never understand european humor.Anytime you're given a franchise, you'll love to excercise all possible storylines. Since it's already had it's success, you have a greater margin for error. What Whedon gave us is a plot thin as a wet tissue, and full of holes to see through. There was little explaining of anything, which could be a good thing. A script this messy how much more can it get if you let them explain it. What plot was there, was for the aliens to be shot at, destroyed, a character dies in between, and more aliens die. It's getting old, and so is this series. Thumbs down.",1,4,8,13 November 2000
Blade," Great action flick
","Blade was simply fun. Ignore the critique a while and just sit back to watch the movie. I wasn't expecting Wesley Snipes to go Braveheart with the humans over the terror being brought down by evil vampires. I expected good action, martial arts, and lots of it. Blade delivers as an action flick. Some of the characters maybe like cardboard, particularly Blade himself, but it's not so to hurt the movie. It doesn't become too melodramatic to a degree unlike many action movies try to do with their heroes. What you get from Snipes is a good I-can-own-your-ass-anyday performance. What more do you need? About the only negative side of the movie I can tell you right off would probably have to be its reference to vampire history. 'Pure Bloods'? Vampire eccentrics will cry infamy over this novelty but that's about the worse of it.I was disappointed at the ending though, and so the DVD version is a MUST see with the alternate ending.",7,0,1,23 October 2000
Gettysburg," Over-dramatic, over-patriotic film bogged by needless speeches
","Gettysburg as a movie is less about the battle and more about the some 100,000 American soldiers (Union and Confederate) which took part of. What it tries to accomplish is to squeeze in every famous, and not so recognizable, name into the film with a bunch of zealous speeches including moments where they actually turn to you and EXPLAIN what they are doing as if we had absolutely no clue what the heck's going on. That is perhaps one of the biggest flaws. I don't want to hear them explain to me. I want to see it on the screen.Speaking of speeches, too many for a war film. Sure, they want to show Gettysburg from the Union and the Confederate's side. Sure, they want to show that even though the two sides are in this extremely horrifying and bloody political war, they are still Americans at heart. They still love each other. I like to see that once. I don't like seeing and hearing it over and over again on the film.Overall I gave it a 4, and only because I'm a sucker for war films... except maybe Pearl Harbor. If you want to watch a Civil War film, watch Glory instead. Dramatic and patriotic film that doesn't rely on speeches. Just valiant acts.",1,6,17,13 February 2002
Gettysburg," Too much on so little time
","Give the production crew a ton of credit for trying to cram as much of the epic battle as possible in a time frame as small as the budget will give.
Gettysburg had way too much story. The battle focuses on every character. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I've studied the battle itself and every commander made a difference. Was it necessary though to add a speech for every character? It seemed to me the diector wanted each hero to be glorified, and there were alot to begin with. The movie doesn't focus on the Union, nor the Confederates, it does to both. Having both, the movie breaks down and focuses on each and every general to the lieutnenants. Why so much? If the movie focused on a group of characters, a piece of the battle, it would have scored higher for me. There was just too much, too much talk, and too much of the battle altogether that nearly made me fall asleep.
Gettysburg isn't a great documentary. If it were broken down to a made for television series, then it would have been enjoyable.  Otherwise, I found it too long and it didn't keep my interest for too long.",1,3,12,11 November 2000
We Were Soldiers," We Were Trying Too Hard To Be Different
","I consider We Were Soldiers an okay film at best. It conveys a simple message, and we understand the gist of the first major battle between the U.S. and North Vietnam. However, as it goes into details, that's when things start to go awry and near borderline tedium and boredom. My main problem lies with Randall Wallace's approach into making this film. Aside some shoddy directing, the script was mediocre. Unlike previous Vietnam War movie attempts, Wallace gets rid of all the negative aspects of the war (refreshing change), and fills the movie with good Christians and loving fathers versus a determined enemy composed of mostly cannon fodder. I liked how he portrayed the NV leader as a strategist, and a bit of human emotion (he is defending his homeland from the American invasion) but can Wallace do better than letting the NV soldiers run mindlessly towards blazing M-16s? Another question, what's the deal with the tacked on fictitious scenes towards the finale? Is this supposed to be more patriotic and dramatic? Hardly. The acting was average at best. It's difficult to deliver good characters with solid development, and recount the events of a major battle all under 2 hours, but it CAN be done. See Glory for a prime example. We Were Soldiers, falls a couple of steps short however. BUT, I can pardon that because like Black Hawk Down, this movie was made to only tell you about the La Drang battle and not provide characters to remember.Of course, all of these questions are a matter of personal preference with war movies. You either feel moved by tear-jerking scenes, or you can be joes like me that simply don't buy it (especially those who've read the novel). For me, I say again that this movie was okay, but certainly not great and certainly no Oscar contender.7/10",1,5,10,8 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas continues to flaunt his inability to write
","There are minor improvements from Phantom Menace (Jar Jar with FAR less screen time and no more Jake Lloyd) but nevertheless a motion picture disaster flawed by the same glaring faults from the previous installment. The blame, again, falls on George Lucas and his stubborn and egotistical mindset that no person on this good Earth should be unable to appreciate is utter nonsense. The writing was, once again, atrocious and pitiful, and when you have a charcter spout lines like this:ANAKIN: I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything's soft... and smooth...
That is one major malfunction in the Skywalker Ranch. I can excuse the diner scene (which was completely ridiculous in a sci-fi fantasy film) and the absurdity of Dooku's characters and his cartoon side-kicks, but I can not excuse lousy writing. Here's an idea for Episode III, get a new Writer, and get a new Director.3/10",1,11,25,7 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the greatest fantasy films of all-time...
","The first installment had its moments and yes, I was wowed and thrilled by seeing one of my favorite novels come to the big screen. However, FotR didn't exactly leave a lasting impression on me unlike, for example, Platoon, where I would always remember the message it brought to me... sort of like a novel. FotR, to me, was more like a spectacular fireworks show.The plot behind the story is simple and Jackson and his group did a very good job transmuting what was in the novel to a screenplay. I don't know why some people complained about the 'complexity', or didn't understand the purpose of the characters or the plot. How much clearer can Jackson make it without smacking you all in the face and telling you to wake up? It's about a ring, a very powerful ring, crafted by a evil menace. That evil menace lost his ring, and now he's back to reclaim it, but it's now in the hands of an innocent Hobbit. That Hobbit goes to Place A for advice, meets a myriad of characters all of whom describe how evil and powerful the ring is, and now he must go destroy it. Jesus Christ, this isn't quantum physics here.In any case, the movie does a more than adequate job portraying Tolkien's world in oh, 3 hours. It's a monumental task and I'm sure Jackson has spent many a sleepless nights pondering what he could use and what he had to throw out from the 600 pages of the original novel. The sets were done flawlessly (Khazad-Dum ranks as one of my favorite scenes) with the amount of CGI and excellent directing and lighting, and it provided a real and genuine fantasy feeling unlike the schlockfest from Attack of the Clones. My only gripe would be the characters themselves. All of them, decent acting, but the decision how they were going to be relevant to the story... well... that's my gripe. Examples, Jackson's poor handling of Boromir's death scene, the lack of the Broken Sword story with Aragorn, and Gimli's 180 of character from the novel. Regardless, it didn't detract me from thoroughly enjoying most of the movie.I am eagerly anticipating for the Two Towers based on the second novel, IMO, the best of the trilogy, this winter.9/10",10,1,1,7 October 2002
Lilo & Stitch," A decent family film for 2002
","There's nothing grandiose about this Disney film. It is, after all, about a super-strong lonely alien crash-landing on Hawaii and looking for a bit of refuge. What it does accomplish is good, clean, fun entertainment for children AND adults alike in one movie (toss in a few family value lessons, too); something I have yet to seen accomplished in the Summer of 2002. That's all you could really want and Disney does it with good style with nothing over the top. Lilo & Stitch is a pure gem, and certainly worth the time to go see, or if you have already, add to your DVD collection.8/10",10,1,1,15 August 2002
Resident Evil," Mind-boggling stupidity
","SPOILERS... After a year since I last saw this mockery of film-making, I figured maybe a second-viewing would help me tolerate this film. That had to be the second biggest mistake of my life next to agreeing to go see Wing Commander. The mistakes and flaws in the film were made that much more obvious with a second-viewing I nearly had to gouge my eyes out in spite of its sheer medicority and utter ridiculousness.I tried to like this film... it was, after all, based on the cheesy video game from Japan that had some pretty good moments. I guess it was too much of a task to have both actors and a script in a movie even though Anderson has made some horrible films with some decent acting (Event Horizon) or cheesy acting with a pretty good film (Mortal Kombat). Resident Evil has neither. The plot is generic, and serves only as an excuse to develop a senseless sequel, have Milla pose half-nude (to appease the RE fans I figure) and have plenty of zombies go ballistic. With some stretch of the imagination this COULD be tolerable and FUN but there are two very glaring mistakes in the film that stand out like a leper in a crowd:1) Their choice of Actors - Cheesy, screwed up action films have only 2 saviors, excellent action sequences (to some degree), and at least average acting. Brotherhood of the Wolf, as ridiculous of a story as it was, had very decent acting and incredibly well-done sequences and cinematography. Resident Evil, with its silly storyline, had characters with the uncanny power to read their lines off script cards. Impressive. Can they act that horribly, or did they put effort into it? The leader of this ragtag bunch of soldiers was pretty cool. He could deliver all of his lines in monotone and display one facial expression. Needless to say, he was killed off quick. In fact, nearly all of the useless soldiers were killed off quickly (just like John Carpenter's Vampires) which I guess was a plus for Anderson. Michelle Rodriguez, playing in vain as the Vasquez-hack of Aliens (more about this later), tops him by emoting one emotion along with her delivery of lines in monotone. Sad, she was wasted in this film. A myriad of other characters share this same profile, including the dear Milla who can kill zombies with martial arts even though an entire clip of a MP5 will do nothing. By the way, why was she trained to do this? She could kick some serious behind for no explicable reason yet her partner/husband (this was never explained either) had none of the training? I assume all of this was discarded to ensure the people will return for the explanation in the sequel. At the other end of the spectrum, we also have Eric Mabius, who could display two emotions... slightly confused, and very confused. You know I've read the early drafts to this heinous monstrosity and he annoyingly keeps adding about how the suspense of this movie will freak you. Sorry, buddy, your whole crew of actors actually made us laugh more.2) Hacking other movies - I can point out at least a half dozen different scenes where Anderson (who loves to recycle other people's work) pulls from Aliens. These aren't subtle attempts, or clever renditions. I'm assuming his thought process was like this:Anderson: Wow, I just thought up of a cool and gruesome way to kill off all of my useless actors! What can I do to make it 'suspenseful' and filled with 'tension'.Anderson's Brain: How about watching the movie Aliens and copy the scene where the marines were attacked for the first time?Anderson: Good idea! Let's see, I'll take the Hive, the Queen, and even the Aliens popping out of nowhere and snatching people. I could even recycle the lines without changing them! I am a GENIUS!Pretty pathetic, and I'm not even going to bother pointing out the stupidity of some of the plot elements or the other movies it borrows heavily from (like Odyssey). By the way, if this T-Virus was so powerful we are led to believe, why does it take a millennia for it to take effect on a live person? All in all, I couldn't find a single shred of entertainment in this. Why would I? If you took a recipe for Chicken with sauce diable and you thought it'd be neat to recycle it and throw in tang and peanut butter, it's not going to taste any good.3/10",1,24,46,25 October 2002
Resident Evil," Quite possibly one of the worst trash
","... to ever be exposed to celluloid.SOME SPOILERSResident Evil follows the cliché and the stereotype right smack-in-your-face down to the letter. Excusing the fact that this is yet again another blatant Aliens hack, what we have here is one tough chick with a questionable past leading a bunch of commandos (except her reason was never explained clearly) into ground zero of monster-infested territory. All sound familiar?Paul Anderson shows once again what he does best and that is try to rip off past successful horror-action flicks with high budget slick special effects and show absolute no regard to continuity or a plot that makes sense. Good God the amount of crap that was displayed on the screen. We have plenty of cannon-fodder here who wander off for no apparent reason (other then being plain stupid) to be chomped on by zombies that appear out of the blue (and disappear just as quickly) or diced up by slick special effect laser beams! This happens way too often by the way. We have also the, err, undead themselves that seem impervious to close range 9mm rounds, but yet some skinny supermodel actress knocks them out with martial arts? Speaking of undead, the story itself how they were created is pretty hilarious. It's not really the virus as some of veteran gamers of the series believe. It's really this evil machine that went HAL9000 on its or hers or whatever folks. Funny stuff!To add to the camp factor, we also get to have a sex scene. Simply can't do a movie of this caliber without one. All in all, Resident Evil might seem good if you're into the mindless mayhem with bad acting and crayon written scripts like the godawful monster flicks from the Sci-Fi Channel. Otherwise, skip this crap and go for mindless mayhem with real style like Blade 2.Score: 1 out of 10.",1,2,5,15 March 2002
Independence Day," Eye Candy once more...
","Independence Day drawn out money from pockets everywhere with one recycled plot and that is aliens invade and defeat us, and now we must have the strength to take back what's ours. Anyone expecting any sort of patriotism from this film should have their eye's and mind rechecked. It doesn't offer enough for you to feel any sympathy for the characters. It DOES offer enough action and special effects to thrill you however. So this begs the question. Does all of the technical know-how and eye candy substitute dialogue? Should every film in the future like Godzilla, Battlefield Earth, Start Trek: Generations, The Phantom Menace, continue to exist where the only reason why they were even made is to a) exploit the audience's weakness for mind-blowing FX, or b) build on an ego?ID-4 had some good moments, when the invading aliens were in the picture and they use their weaponary. Then we're involved with the heroes. Harry Connick Jr. for lack of better words was retarded in this film and had no place in it. Hence the ego statement earlier. At times the people in the movie were frightened from the alien experience, then zany, then happy, then sad again. Do they even know that nearly a third of the world is in ruins? Does Will Smith even remember that his 'so we are led to assume' buddy Harry Jr. died just seconds ago when he pulled out a tacky one liner 'Welcome to Earth.' at the aliens?ID-4 is a brainless movie attempting to bring out good feeling of patriotism just like Armageddon. The fun factor isn't all too well with this one. Some characters were just a bit too dissappointing and annoying for me to bear. Watch this is under mute and then it'll score points.",1,3,7,8 November 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The legend continues...
","*SPOILERS*I'll say this right off the bat. Whatever problems I had with this movie (and there were a few), I nevertheless was impressed deeply with Jackson's handling of CGI and camera. I don't care if you're a naysayer of the series, or a fan. If you're not impressed with the choreography and direction of the battle of Helm's Deep, you need some serious help. No director, to this date, has done what Jackson has done on the screen. He doesn't just throw rambunctious CGI as you would throw a bucket of paint on a murel and call it art. He has a formula. He knows what fits, and what works. Call it good instincts, or maybe he's just a genius. The most important trait for a director is being able to tell the story without the script. Can the audience understand the feeling, or the gist of the story just by looking at the scene, and the actors, and the lighting? Can you integrate CGI into this and still achieve the same effect on the audience? If you mention Final Fantasy, or Star Wars, you'll probably say 'Heck no'. This movie stands alone. The Two Towers, if not going to be recongnized for its good storytelling, is cinematic masterpiece by biblical proportions. That said, I believe Andy Serkis needs some serious, serious consideration for the best supporting actor role as Gollum. It's not just Jackson's employment of some of the most realistic CGI ever used, but the script and acting was done perfectly. We're not just looking at a mindless talking CGI, like Jar Jar, for that whole moment. We really believed we were actually seeing a living, breathing Gollum.Now on to the story itself. Some dedicated Tolkien purists will probably have a few beefs with Jackson for the myriad of changes in the characters. For those who have never read the novels, these changes are only additional subplots for the audience to remember. These aren't detrimental to the actual storyline (to some degree), but nevertheless not very subtle and made rather obvious. I'm a bit on the neutral side in this, but I thought Jackson could have done a lot better. Two things that stand out:1) Legolas - I find it disturbing that fangirls seem to like this character only because Orlando Bloom is 'cute' despite the horrible dialogue Jackson and Walsh provided for him. This only cheapens Legolas. If he were any other movie character concocted by any other writer, it can be excused. Not Legolas. I thought Jackson should've given more thought to him. Give him one personality (he seems to bounce back and forth between optimism, and pessimism at the whim), and make him kick more butt. He's an Elf. His combat prowess and reliability should be paramount. Why make him act and look ridiculous (the surf scene with the shield bugs me to all Hell)? I'm not saying give Legolas the powers of Jet Li, but at least enhance his fighting abilties if you are not going to give him good lines. Just wishful thinking. This brings me to the next point:2) Legolas / Gimli - I can somewhat see the need of comedy relief in something as dark and morbid as the Two Towers would eventuate towards the final hour of the movie. I have no problem with that. However, because Legolas seems to shift between personalities, and Gimli seems to be more focused on creating comedy relief, their friendship is virtually non-existant. As a result, their whole 'how many can you kill' little adventure in Helm's Deep is out of place, and awkward.
Not exactly detrimental. None of this detracts me from enjoying the movie, but it stuck in my mind even at the closing credits. Oh well.
The Two Towers succeeds in telling the story, and that's important. Not exactly Tolkien's story, but Jackson interpretation of the novel series. He provides enough, without going overboard, or cutting too much. The dialogue isn't exactly top-notch, or memorable (in fact, it's actually quite subpar in my opinion) but it gets the job done.Anyway, I'm not going to go anymore deeper. For me, I'm not going to remember this movie for the story. I'll leave that to my leather-bound collector's series (yes I am a Tolkien fanatic). I'll remember this movie for its technical achievements, and the way Gollum stole the entire show.8/10",10,0,0,22 December 2002
Men in Black II," Nod ya Head, if you were bored like I was
","The sequel is pretty much recycled garbage built around unused jokes that were left on the editing room floor (for a reason) from Men In Black One. Putrid, and infantile. Will Smith plays the exact same character from all of his movies, the Fresh Prince, with a dog as a partner this time around (Tommy Lee Jones comes in later after Will finally realizes he can't carry a film even if his life depended on it), and we get to see the powers of the Miracle Bra.

Black Hawk Down," A good film for those who understand it
","I'll keep my review short and sweet. A whole lot of you seem to have misunderstood what BHD is as a movie, based on the reviews I'm reading here. Some of you expected some message to be conveyed by this movie, like a lesson in life or whatever. That wasn't the purpose of this movie. BHD is a step-by-step retelling of the Mogadishu (sp? too lazy to check) incident which involved U.S. Delta Force / Rangers on a near-botched mission against the thousands of warring-Somalians. It's simple as that. I wasn't expecting to leave the theater completely enlightened (unlike Platoon which is one the true WAR films), but I did learn more about the events that went on there and for me, that's good enough.7/10",Null,0,1,15 August 2002
There's Something About Mary," A good romantic comedy
","The movie is a good comedy and an excellent date flick. I enjoyed the oddball type chemistry between Stiller and Diaz. The relationship works for me and no way tacky in any manner. I would have expected something worse but the story is good and dare I say heart warming. Some of the wacky scenes and jokes were pushing it a tad too far, e.g. the scene Matt Dillon spies Diaz removing her top and accidentally sees the neighbor. That can trigger endless nightmares.The jokes were funny, provided a few laughs, and the twists in the end were interesting. I did find it odd though that Mary / Cameron Diaz loves a man who travels alot, doesn't like to settle down in one place, yet her work lies in one place and it seems her work is equally as important. She enjoys helping the mentally challenged, why would she say she liked travelling around? Anyway, besides that, this movie is an excellent film to watch on dates.",Null,0,0,11 November 2000
The Matrix," A Favorite
","The Matrix is a technical and special FX marvel of unbound lengths. What they have put together here, the scenery, the colors, the lightning, the sets, is a true masterpiece of the sci-fi genre. The story, a bit more serious and exponentially more intelligent than the folly of Phantom Menace released in the same year, does make you think about the privacy of our own world. This question has always been around us, although maybe in a different tone and not as dramatic as how The Matrix brings it out. Are we really monitored and watched by someone? When we purchase by credit card, make a phone call, go on the Internet, what have you, all of those signals broadcast out, are they being monitored? It at least plants a thought in your brain compared to some of the other recent mindless sci-fi films which includes the aforementioned Phantom Menace and Wing Commander. There are a few parts of the movie that were recycled from earlier films. I don't really mind since NEARLY EVERY sci-fi film since the birth of the genre has recycled one of the older concepts at one point or another. It's already a known fact. Tinkering around it however and throwing in your own blend and style is what distinguishes the new from the old.Every character in the film is unique, with the exception of maybe Neo who Keanu expertly plays as another airhead. What I like about the characters is that they work with each other well.  They rely upon each other's individual strengths. Neo could have turned into a one man show easily for the entire film but it took everyone to get him there and he feeds off of that.
I'm glad that this film did so well with the awards and the box-office. It tells you the sci-fi genre, the serious sci-fi, is still alive.",10,0,0,27 October 2000
Heat," Great movie with excellent characters...
","*Spoilers*The movie is an incredible film and it serves as an excellent piece to show you how a great director and writer like Mann can take many characters, and give each of them enough depth so you understand and pity them when their time comes. Examples, Breedan (played by Senator Palmer from 24) has about 10 minutes of total screen time altogether in the movie but we know he's an ex-con, and we know he's trying to get his life back together. However, as we can see in the film, not everyone has a welcome mat for him, and he struggles. The short dialogue between him and his loyal girlfriend afterwards serves as a great scene as he vents his frustrations which ultimately leads to his decision to rejoin De Niro's crew. Subplots like this, done smoothly and all tie in with each other, help establish each of the great characters. Val Kilmer is a reckless gambler and a horrible husband, but his wife still loves him and he finally acknowledges that when the world's coming down on him. Sizemore is the complete opposite. He tries to be a good father and husband, BUT he has trouble balancing his loyalty to De Niro whom he has worked with for years, and his family. His job is dangerous, how long can he continue doing this? And there are plenty of others, all question their obligations towards family and their work which is good. I simply don't understand how anyone could consider this 'boring'? Would people have preferred no character development and just mindless explosions and shootouts? Let's not forget Heat is a drama/action film (by the same man who brought us Miami Vice), not an action film.
And to all of the other naysayers of this movie, based on your inane and asinine remarks of various scenes, it's quite obvious you have NOT seen the movie. If you intend to criticize a good film, try to watch it instead of taking what little negative remarks (when they are themselves fabricated out of their bungholes) out there and using it as your own. You sound like a complete moron when you do.Heat is a great film, with memorable characters.9/10",10,0,0,24 September 2002
Braveheart," Flawed, but well done...
","Mel Gibson, who also directs, plays the hero William Wallace, a Scottish patriot who brings a fighting passion into the common man against the tyranny of the English and the bigotry of the Scottish nobleman.As it turns out, he becomes a brilliant tactician. He designs a new weapon to counter English armored cavalry. He outwits the English by having his army fight in unorthodox pattern, the Scots now are smarter and they fight better with more passion now with Wallace leading. All of this for not in the end because Wallace fails to see betrayal within the eyes of the Scottish noblemen who want nothing more than money and land in exchange for their peace. Seems all too predictable but it sets up half an hour of what the bad side of William Wallace really is if you get on it.The battle scenes are the best choreographed I have ever seen at the cinema. Watching the fights on the big screen makes so much of a difference. It is stunning, I will tell you that. The story is compelling, for the most part, and it leads you along smoothly which I like. I found the intimacy between Wallace and Isabelle odd and out of place however. Much of what drives Wallace, besides freedom from the English, was anguish from his slain wife. He dreams about her, has visions of her after her death. Why cheat his dreams on another woman? Did he finally give in to the fact he's lost her? If so, that entire piece of Wallace was cut off from the film. Or, maybe they gave in to their feelings to each other. Again, if so, that entire piece was cut off as well. It was too sudden, too quick.
Nevertheless, Braveheart is an impressive film and easily will rank as one of the greatest stories ever told on film. Beautiful  sets, and well directed. If not for some of the tacky scenes like that romance, it would have been flawless and as close as perfection of a movie as you can get.",5,2,7,30 October 2000
