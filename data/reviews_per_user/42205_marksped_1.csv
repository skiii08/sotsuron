Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat
","Its either your cup or tea or not, I'm a big fan of this sort of comedy, where the actor is in part and there is an unsuspecting member of the public, in this instance trying to come to terms with someone who they think is foreign and culturally different.Its insulting, sexist, racist, homophobic and will be totally appalling to anyone who is politically correct and takes offence to this kind of humour, but if it is your cup of tea, you'll find it very funny, there are parts that are mediocre, i thought that a feature length film would struggle anyway, on the TV you get snapshots condensed in a limited time frame and it's great entertainment, but overall I found the film very funny.Chenquie.",9,3,10,14 November 2006
