The Rock," The Ultimate Man Movie
","Now I'm not saying that 'The Rock' doesn't have flaws in it, or that cheesy American patriotic crap, but what I am merely saying is that if you are a man, this movie runs through your veins.  So you could call it a test of manhood (yeah, I did get that from Braveheart) if they like the movie, at least you know they're not turning into femmy guys.  However, this movie is not just for guys, there are girls who like it too (not many I know), but it is aimed more towards the male audience.'The Rock' has pretty much everything that a guy could ask for from a movie: Sweet cars in fast paced-chase scenes, great action sequences, a girl, stunning special effects, tense amazing music, and of course, Sean Conery. Throw in some comedy, and you've got a super-sized platter of Steak du jour.The Plot is great, no, it's classic.  I could not think of a much better plot for a movie, or how I could make this movie better, I wouldn't want to, classics should be treasured in our hearts!If you are a guy who has not seen this movie, shame on you, you've failed the gender.  if you are a girl, maybe you should watch this movie to better understand your man.  if you are confused about what you are, watch 'The Rock' and if you like it, I can bet good money on it, you're a guy.",Null,2,2,8 December 2002
