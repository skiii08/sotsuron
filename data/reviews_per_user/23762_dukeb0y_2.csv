The Monuments Men," Interesting, to a degree.
","Only three stars. First, a glaring mistake. When the map of April 1943 is shown to President Roosevelt, is clearly shows Vichy France. Which no longer existed after November 1942. A similar map is used in 1944. Doesn't anyone check a history book?I will agree, this movie is interesting, but poorly structured. For example, we have no clue as to how the extra soldiers were ordered to help the 'Monuments Men'(MM). The MM find a mine loaded with art, then suddenly, 100s of men and trucks show up to retrieve it. And yet earlier, a MM, could not even get two extra soldier as guards to go with him.As far as the sets and equipment, it gets a passing grade. The Kubelwagen was a nice touch.Three stars, that's it.",3,26,34,12 February 2014
Interstellar," Choppy, and way too long.
","I went into this movie with high hopes. Glad I had a DVD to fast forward.Spoilers spoilers spoilers.... OK, the crops are dying and we have a new dust bowl, so far, so good. But it went on and on. (and on and on....and on and on) And as another reviewer pointed out, we have this secret underground NASA base just a stones throw from where his farm is. Uh Huh. OK, So, gee, he 'wanders in'..and will leave the next day on the hidden spaceship to save the world!I buy that, don't you?Now, it did have a GREAT idea, as we go through the wormhole, we 'could' pop out at a different time. Forward in time , and 'MAYBE' backward. OK, this could get interesting, could they pop out BEFORE the dust bowl and return to earth? (and save the world?)Nope.But they do find the other astronauts who went out before them, but I won't give that part away. Land on a few planets.And the robot, at first, I thought, what a CHEAP looking robot, but I took a liking to it. 'He' actually saves the day. His name is TARS. Kind of liked him.I gave it one star to balance out those 9 stars.",1,4,10,20 May 2015
