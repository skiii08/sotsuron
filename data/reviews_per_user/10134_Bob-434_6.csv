Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, not great, well worth price of admission
","This is a very entertaining movie that I would recommend, especially for kids, but also for adults.  I preferred the earlier Star Wars and am looking forward to the next two installments.  Everyone says that the special effects are wonderful - and they are right.  The plot and characters are ok, about what you would expect from a good, not great, movie.I enjoyed Matrix more than Star Wars and recommend Matrix as the better movie, although it has the drawback of depicting a lot of violence, which Star Wars does not.  Star Wars is a wonderful family movie.",7,0,0,25 May 1999

The Mummy," Average with a few nice special effects
","This movie is flat.  It does not draw you in.  Some of the special effects were pretty good - if you've seen the preview, you've seen them.The prejudicial stereotypes of Arabs were unpleasant.  They were depicted as stupid, smelly, uncouth, underhanded, etc.  One cannot imagine a major studio releasing stereotypes like this of blacks or Jews nowadays, but apparently Arabs are still fair game.I suspect the movie is being both helped and hurt by Matrix.  Matrix was so good with such incredible effects and a good story, that I was hoping such innovation had become standard - that the next big release would also be able to match it.  So I went with high hopes.  Which were dashed.   Matrix really was a creative work.  Mummy was just boring.My bet is that after a colossal first weekend based on audience hope, the movie drops like a stone.",5,0,0,10 May 1999
Arrival," Incredibly boring, and I really like SF movies
","This movie just dragged and dragged. At the end, it tried to resolve issues (here is the spoiler) with a version of time travel, which turned out to be fairly senseless itself. Mind you, I really like sf movies, particularly that use time travel, say, About Time or Edge of Tomorrow, but this movie was just boring. Scenes drawn out and drawn out. The interactions with the aliens seemed to be time wasters. There are such good actors in this movie, but except for the lead Amy Adams, they had almost no role to play that contributed to the story. Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker. What a waste of good talent. I have seen the high ratings given by critics on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes and just do not understand how they arrived at their conclusions.",1,144,316,31 December 2016
The Matrix," Use the bathroom before the movie starts!
","Silly me, drinking all that coke before The Matrix--thinking I could just dash out to the john during a lull in the film.  Surprise . . .the lull never happens!  I was glued to the screen , mesmerized for over two hours--not daring to leave for fear I'd miss the twists and turns of this thought-provoking plot.  At the end I can honestly say, I've never been more impressed with a sci-fi flix and my bladder has never been fuller.",9,0,0,11 April 1999
The Matrix," Stupendous special effects, great action flick, the audience clapped at the end.
","This movie is about as close to a William Gibson (science fiction Hugo award winning) cyberpunk novel put on a screen as one could imagine.  It's not written by Gibson, but seems like it could have been.  The virtual reality is almost perfect.I had read that the plot was thin and the middle third slow.  The plot is just fine for an action film and the pacing throughout was just right in my opinion.  I wish it had been longer.  I hope it makes a fortune so more like it will be produced.My eleven year old son and his friend also thought it was great.   My son's first comment was; 'Dad, we have to get this video when it comes out.'  I agreed.  To put that in context, when we saw 'Wing Commander', his comment was - 'That sure was boring.'The movie is rated R and there's quite a bit of video arcade/action style violence.  There is also a scene at the beginning that I thought might produce nightmares for a kid - shoot, maybe even for an adult.  So don't take children much younger than 11 or children who you do not want exposed to violence.The evil guy, Mr. Smith, is nearly perfect for the role and the role is just right for the movie.  Kudos also to the two lead actors and actress. Actually, a lady who shows up in the middle of the movie pretty much steals the scene she's in.",9,0,0,3 April 1999
