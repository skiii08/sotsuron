It," Why hate this movie? I loved it!
","In short:
Was it a good movie?
Yes, yes it was. (I personally loved it)Was it scary?
No, not really. But I knew what to expect and it delivered it, so I had no problem of not jumping out of my seat every 2 minutes but wahtching a bunch of kids battle a clown-monster-thing while facing their own fears...
Any problems with it?
Well, the CGI looked like CGI a lot (in fact most) of the times. But thankfully it wasn't just CGI, so I can let that one slip. That is why this movie is no a perfect 10 in my book, but just a solid 9.
Anything outstanding?
Oh my yes. The acting. These kids were so great I was amazed. And I really have to point out that Sophia Lillis was just so great in the non-scary scenarios. I'm really looking forward seeing her in other films. Anyways back to the movie and why others migh not like it as much as I did...((Now comes the part with the spoilers))
Was it supposed to be the the book on the big screen?
To answer this I have to say, that I've seen the miniseries as a child (probably the reason why I never really like clowns). But only read the book a few years ago as an adult. And when I heard a new IT movie is in the making I watched the old one again.
Now the miniseries was supposed to be the book on the big screen. And it mostly was. And that is why I didn't like that one... It was a really good adaptation of a good book that I hated the ending of. Seriously.. a giant siperlike thing? In the sequence with the kids there were no spider-monster... and when you are an adult.. you have to face a huge ass spider? why not the same old clown with like a chainsaw or I dunno... anything else..
anyways the 2017 IT movie got it right. It took the STRONG part of the story and made it a stand-alone version of it. AND IT WORKS! Now it has an AWESOME ENDING!! This is not the book on the big screen. BUT IT NEVER WAS SUPPOSED TO! The moive is BASED ON THE NOVEL. (that is what's written at the lower left corner of the screen at 5:16) You all know what 'based on' means right? It means it's not the novel! If you want that, you go ahead and read it. It is a great reading (up until the end, but that's my opinion only).
((End of spoilers))Was it a good idea the change the setting so much?
It's 2017. Back in the late 80s when the book came out (or in 90 when the miniseries did) it was supposed to be set in the 50s and in the 'present time'. Now it's a good thing that the 'kids sequence' is set in the late 80s when we were kids (well I was born in the late 80s, but still. The whole setting just felt a lot like my childhood). So to answer my question. Yes, it was a good idea, that the setting was changed (so much).Well I could probably go on for hours, but I won't. What I will say is:
Watch it with an open mind and think of all the things you were so afraid of back when you were a kid. I know I did. And I enjoyed (almost) every minute of this movie. (And thank you for reading my review.)
And one last thing: did I mention how good Sophia Lillis is?",9,1,1,22 December 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," A movie you have to watch at least two times.
","To be honest, the first time I didn't get why anyone would love this movie. It was fun to watch and sometime in the middle I got what it was about. (didn't know anything beforehand, that's how I like to watch movies)
I really like Joss Whedon's style and this movie screamed of it. That is why I kinda liked it the first time.After a year or so I tought why not give it a second go? As I remember it was kinda fun...
And than the magic happened! Everything fell into place. Now that I know what was going on from the first minute this movie just got so much better I can't describe. I LOVED every minute of it. It was a whole new experience.This is a movie you HAVE to watch at least 2 times to fully enjoy it. So on the first go I gave it a 6/10, now it's a 10/10... So I'm gonna average it at 9/10 :)",9,0,2,7 February 2018
