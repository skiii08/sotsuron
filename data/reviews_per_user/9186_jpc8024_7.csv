Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," my review of sherlock holmes 2 a game of shadows
","Sherlock Holmes 2 A Game of Shadows The sequel to Sherlock Holmes has more pizazz and atrocious slow motion camera shots then any film this year. The story is a coherent one but the action sequences slow it down. Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriaty, a genius mathematician who wrote the book The Astronomicals of an Asteroid are common enemies. Professor Moriaty distract Sherlock Holmes evidential and clueless mind while building ant-Christ missiles and bombs in a abandoned stockyard. While Holmes is busy with talking to a fortune teller/gyspy played by Noami Roapooce, Dr. Watson is getting married and enjoying his honeymoon with his beloved wife. But soon Sherlock Holmes invades Dr. Watson's life by meeting with him intensively on the train and throwing Watson's wife off a bridge to catch up with his brother Mycroft Holmes who is setting up a summit auction party in Switzerland. But for Watson's wife, he is embarrassed to be around Mycroft Holmes because he is in the nude. Robert Downey Jr.'s accent is great. Even Jude Law portraying Dr. John Watson is fun. I have no problem with the art direction. It is gorgeous in 1891. You have London, Paris, Switzerland, Berlin and Scotland. It sets the mood for a Sherlock Holmes story. The problem is the action sequences. For a young audience Sherlock Holmes goes from a detective having fun with clues and spy games in the first half of the movie to a elite stone cold action hero in the end. The slow-mo scenes are in every corner. It reminded me of the Matrix Reloaded or a PC computer game. The editing is way off in the sequel and the original score is the same from the first movie 2 years ago. No new piece of music. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows has it's flaws but it is still a quirky film with humorous and naughty moments to pleasurable movie entertainment. If you want a film that really is like the Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories go back and re watch the films from the mid-40's or early seventies PBS Mysteries that reinvented the Holmes character as he is in the book, a clueless detective looking for mystery. Robert Downey Jr. is the right choice for portraying Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law is reliable as the infamous Dr. John Watson. But except this one to be more marveled than the classic mysteries of the past.",8,1,2,2 January 2012

This movie is directed by Steven Spielberg who is fit for the job of bringing Herge's visual story to the screen. The film is a treat for Spielberg fan lovers. It's action-packed animation can be exhaustingly fun. The 3-Dthrowaway glasses do make A DIFFERENCE WITH THE PICTURE. I say it was one magical movie with lots of stuff thrown at you on screen that will explosively feast your eyes on the magical adventure roller coaster ride.",8,0,1,28 December 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Slow, but good
","The prologue is interesting. Afterwards, it gets slow. Not many action scenes. But the characters and plot are watchable. This movie is passable. It explores the world of tolkien. It's an introduction. Some of the scenes are like a video game such as the bridge of khaz-dum. Some of the scenes are well-done like the battle at the end. The ending is a good premise that were going into some darker themes. Good fantasy.8/10.",10,1,2,30 October 2003

District 9," District 9-Going to see it again
","'District 9' is a science fiction film that clearly states a message in it's arc of story. Producer Peter Jackson and first time director Neil Blomkamp takes a documentary/mock'u'mentary approach that we should understand other unknown species, we should protect strange lifeforms that come in our science laboratories and we should envict, protect and care for illegal human aliens who get a free ride into the country without being a licensed citizen and can't find a way to live on money because their jobless , that is the reality we have to face.The fantasy of this movie is the fictional South African character Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley who gets picked upon as the head of the Department of Alien Affairs at Multi-National United Environmental Corporation in Johannesburg, South Africa to do a job. Wikus and his G-Men are going to drive out to the District 9 colony where these so called aliens nicknamed 'prawns' have been living there for the last 28 years and now all the general population people want them out of the city, but MNU is buildung a facility called District 10 to keep these aliens away from the busy day lives of Earthlings. MNU has these big over-sized motor vehicles to keep them safe. The District 9 Colony is a junkyard and I mean a junkyard. These aliens who look like grasshoppers, shrimp and lobster tails with a over-sized tunic on their bodies need a reality check but they also need protection and possibly death. Some of them have children. While Wikus is their he finds a Nigerian soldier who is guarding the District 9 colony and only asks for money and aims a weapon at him. The third act of this movie is a action-packed thrill ride. Wikus transports himself with the alien spacecraft to the mother ship but does not succeed.With all the hype out their and all the fanboyism 'movies' this summer, 'District 9' is a film that will be understood by the general population if you the moviegoer 'tells them what I just explained to you'.Peter Jackson is a genius. Him as a producer is going to be what really sells this movie. Move over 'Lord of the Rings'(joking because I'm a fan of that movie) because there's a newbie in town. Director Neil Blomkamp is also the genius storywriter. Blomkamp took the science fiction genre and turned it right side up telling a story and visually shocking the general moviegoers who are just passing by for a entertaining show. I can't wait to see this film again. It will help us grow a little each day.",10,6,13,15 August 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Stunt ensemble Oscar Here We Come
","MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 4: GHOST PROTOCOL Mission: Accomplished. Tom Cruise as Ethan hunt, Simon Pegg as Benjie, Jeremy Renner as the helper, Paula Patton as the girl. The first film in the series opened in 96' with the NOC List operation throughout the Globe, spanning from Prague to Berlin to CIA intelligence to Paris to London. The second film was the operation Khimera. Global nuclear war was starting to spread. The third installment got more hypothetical, more challenging and interesting. The fourth film in the franchise is a stunt spectacular and the most complex spy game scenario ever. There's a lot of extremely well played 'pull it off' stunts that will have action audience fans and geek squad fans talking for months about the new gadgets, the new earpiece technology to play a real good spy game for fans of Bruce Geller's famous Mission: Impossible series. But the one big stunt-scale that people will be talking about is the high jump wired stunt that is 130 stories tall at the largest building in the world in the city of Dubai, the BeLerg Tower. This sequence had some serious aerial dares. It's something to speculate on. Another big stunt which opens the film is lighting the fuse and breaking out of a Russian prison. Another big hit with this movie is foreign language humor. Speaking to a person in a different language so you can crack the codes. You speak Russian especially to get inside the Kremlin, if you are a assassin. If your IMF your in disguise. You have to wear that Russian uniform because your under protection of United States Law Enforcement. The Russian bombing on the Kremlin is a big news deal in this movie. Who do they blame the IMF but IMF doesn't realize this. IMF-Impossible Mission Force thinks there the good guys and the bad guys who are terrorists framing themselves and setting IMF up as the bad guys when then they really coming up with good plans to get after the bad guys. complex protocol and procedure in Spy Commando stuff. Tom Cruise is on his best, most planned mission best behaved mission, yet. Tom Cruise had big hits with Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut, Minority Report and War of the Worlds but he's been making a decline lately ever since his little mishap with doing the jump and down kiddie stunt in his chair on the Oprah Winfrey show. Cruise as Ethan Hunt is a powerhouse in this film. He has a billionaire dollars and accessories to go along with his mission and so does Simon Pegg who seems to be a better technician in the field of robotics. Paula Patton is pretty good as the girl. The girl in this one is a hot tie. Simon Pegg like I said is the geek squad guy. Jeremy Renner is interesting coming straight off the Town and Oscar winning drama The Hurt Locker and other roles he's appeared in.Mission: Impossible 4 is very awesome, very action packed. Those Oscars should have a stunt performance category after this film is finished with the BOX OFFICE run.",9,1,6,28 December 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Unbelievable
","This movie is a first rate epic.  From start to finish, it delivers the essence of Tolkien and his world.  From Gollum to Helm's Deep, the special effects are innocent fun and spectular.  I think Helm's Deep is unbelievable though.  Peter Jackson knows what he's doing.  He has a vision of Middle Earth, that none of us could've imagined.On one hand this is a fantasy, and it's totally not real.  That's why I think it's unbeliveable.  How could this happen?  I don't know. But all I care is that at least it's good.The movie will utterly be remembered years from now.",10,3,4,30 October 2003
