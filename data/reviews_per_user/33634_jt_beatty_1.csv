The New World," I felt obliged to walk out on this film (a feat never before preformed), as did half the audience
","If god were to punish Humanity by forcing them to watch a movie in repetition until their eyes bled, this would be the movie he would show. In all honesty, and i am rather shy to admit this, but i have even sat through some crimes against humanity called 'Spice world' (the spice girls movie) and the terrible wastes of film directed by Uwe Boll (the Hitler of the film industry) and yet The New World takes the cake as the only movie i have ever walked out of. The story was long and felt rather like staring at a wall, minus the action (as staring at the wall, eventually there might be a fly which crawls on the wall, and that is much more exciting then this film, in fact if this film randomly cut into a sequence of some random fly on a random wall, it would have doubled in action. I am not one to complain about lack of action, as i am highly against Van Damme and anyone else who are responsible for plot less movies, but Has anyone seen BraveHeart? Gladiator? i mean a epic is supposed to be epic, and the only moving part of the movie was when half the crowd in tandem decided to move the hell out of the theater 2 hours in. and I'm sorry, but you cant hire 15 year olds for the lead actress!!!!!!",1,4,14,23 January 2006
