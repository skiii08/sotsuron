Sucker Punch," Unbelievable...
","This movie... blew me away. I'm still reeling from it, from this apparent naked-chicks-kicking-ass-gore-fest which is in fact a cinematic masterpiece (and I quite rarely resort to such high praise). It's entirely a metaphor, on multiple levels, and it's just... indescribable. It was something I never expected. I'm just speechless, even now... Watch it and think deep about it. Much more than meets the eye, I promise.The worlds created as babydoll (how ironic to name a victim of such abuse such an innocent name) battles her trauma and inner demons, as she locks herself inside, are spectacular to say the least, humongous in size and obsessive in detail. Even the faux-centerpiece of the movie, the action scenes, have a certain flow to them that is very well built and very properly held together. I also loved all the Matrix references, cracked me up a bit, can't wait for it to come out on some form of disk so I can more closely examine every bit and maybe figure more out of the metaphors and the metaphors inside the metaphors. (inception is kindergarten compared to this)I'm really finding it hard to express my feelings in words about this movie but what I can say is this: it certainly made its mark on me... I'm still trying to understand it all, still affected by the powerful emotional scenes the movie is filled with... I quite honestly feel it is an incredible achievement, a true piece of art, and it deserves huge points for disguising it all under a wrapper of pop and cheesiness that only makes the actual content so much more hard-hitting.",10,9,21,26 March 2011
