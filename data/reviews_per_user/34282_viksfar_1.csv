The Longest Yard," Adam does it again
","I have not seen the original, and maybe that's why i like it....A lot!!! The timing in the jokes is 100% right, and there's one after another...! The only thing I did not like, is Rob Scheider. I know that Adam Sandler and Rob are good friends, and they appear in each others movies, but i think that Rob should have had a different person to play....He's overplaying it. So, if you're down and borred....then put this awesome picture in the DVD/VHS and laugh your socks off, i know i did! The thing that makes it just right, is the thing between Adam and Chris Rock. These guys make it precise that 'it', that kept me crying off laughter!! Watch the film...specially if you like Adam and NFL!",10,1,2,10 February 2006
