It," Awful
","This movie ruined the soul of the book for me. I didn't understand if this was a comedy or a horror. Stephen King does not write comedy's like that. The kids are so annoying in this movie, their acting is so wrong for IT. They are against a creature like IT and they are so childish. They look so 'heroic'. The kids are the stars, Pennywise is just something to beat. That looks really lame to me. It is also giving more attention to the relationship between Bev and Bill then the character of Pennywise or anything else. ï»¿",6,14,27,7 September 2017
