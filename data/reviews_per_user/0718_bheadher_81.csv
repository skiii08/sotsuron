Blade Runner 2049," OMG, this should not have been filmed...
","How can anyone rate a movie that is so slow, drab and gloomy...even when the director turned on some lights, Bladerunner 2049 still was moving so slow that I simply could not get interested...What we are presented, is a bare echo of the Bladerunner we new and loved. The original was filmed as a drab and dreary world, but this one IS drab and dreary, with nothing at all to grab your attention...to me, it was the same as reading a scifi book that isn't very well written, and spending most of the time skipping ten pages at a time, to see if you can find something good in there...this one had exactly the same feel...The ambiance was literally atrocious, and the little things that make a movie good were missing. They even forgot that when someone is in fridgid cold, and it's snowing, you can see your breath, heh heh...that is how bad it really was...",3,3,5,28 January 2018
Men in Black 3," Unfortunately strained and lacking...
","I couldn't give this one more than a 5...while the original MIB was brilliant in its imagination and presentation, MIB3 felt smaller by contrast. MIB2 was much more fun also, but the story behind this outing just didn't hold together. Both Will Smith and Tommy Lee looked like 'What am I doing here, and their performances showed it.The CGI was pretty good, but thrown together to take your mind off the meager story line. Let's face it, somebody decided, 'hey, let's make a third MIB but not too juicy...'. I mean, is there some rule that says sequels must degenerate in quality. Other than the CGI, so much was lacking that I lost interest rather fast, and that doesn't happen that often to me.",5,2,4,20 March 2015
Ghost," There are good movies...and then there is Ghost...
","I've waited thirty years to comment on this one...I remember seeing Ghost when it came out and felt good about it. Now I can actually describe it; the entire presentation was so near perfect as to make you wonder about life after death. The cast meshed with a story that had to be hard to pull off, but they managed it.I've always liked Whoopy, and in this one she actually surpassed herself...she was the perfect foil to bring the thing off...",9,1,1,12 January 2020
Hereditary," Barely has a plot, yet manages to produce ZERO horror...
","Really, I should say that you pretty much know the plot before you ever sit down...it just doesn't really go anywhere else...My housemate is the horror fanatic, so I trust her judgement...me, I can take it or leave it, when it comes to horror flicks.These glowing reviews I see here, have got to be paid reviewrs chosen by the producers...there is literally nothing frightening in this movie, little suspense, and certainly no mystery about why it was made...did I mention scary is absent ??To be politicly correct, Hereditary was hyped as a frightening horror movie, with twists and turns...the only twisting was my housemate squirming, waiting for the movie to end...truthfully, there was almost a riot at the theater, with people demanding their money back, heh heh...",3,36,87,9 June 2018
Gravity," Was This Supposed to be a good movie?
","If so, I'm still trying to figure out why. No, I haven't seen all of it. Only from when they are already outside in suits. I'm no Astronaut but I certainly understand the concept of action and reaction. The suit work with the jet pack was abysmal to say the least. Firing all jets at once isn't the way to control your movements in space, let alone when you have another person tethered to you by a 40 foot tether. They were bouncing all over space like a couple of monkeys. Then to top it off, when they get to the space station, and she is holding onto the severed tether the guy has already stopped his momentum! Yet he convinces her to let go, and off he goes into orbit...unbelievable...I can't go on, don't even want to see all of this one.",4,2,5,16 March 2016
Erin Brockovich," As a true story, it does not get any better...
","While certainly dramatized, this movie does something that most 'based on a true story' movies don't...it feels 'real' all the way through...that is how it was written and acted.'Legal' movies tend to focus onjust the wrangling, and leave the people out of the equation...this one demonstrates just how the people react to legal battles; and how hard it can be to keep proceedings on track...Erin Brockovich is real from the first moment to the last; I watch it every time I see it is on...",10,0,0,9 February 2019
Star Trek," Why is it...
","...that the arrogant Writers and Directors of today believe they can do a story better than the originals? I don't know, but I have not found any fan of the original series (or follow up series) who has one positive thing to say about this 'new version'.JJ needs to go back and read Gene Roddenberrys Guide to the Star Trek Universe in order to perhaps see where he went wrong here. He also needs to realize that CGI alone does not a movie make...Heck, JJ even had the temerity to produce an engine room scene that literally looked like it was shot in an oil processing facility, so enormously huge that it would have taken up over two thirds of the 'real' Enterprise..and let's not forget they had the slowest transporter ever in a Star Trek universe.To put how badly this one came and went, my son even thought it was an insult...and he is much more tolerant of todays movies than I am...",6,2,3,8 November 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Never intended to be a masterpiece...but it suceeds anyway...
","Try and stay with me now...Rogue One departed from the classic look we have all learned to expect, throughout the years, but in this case it isn't a bad thing...this is a more subdued look at what I believe real space warfare would look like...all scenes are darker, both in tempo and presentation. Even the brightest daylight scenes are physically darker...oh, there were one or two bright scenes, but they actually detracted from the overall look. The acting is slower paced than all the other movies, and only vaguely fits into the Star Wars genre...This could be a stand alone movie, for none of the story really ties into the Star Wars Universe, as we would expect. Darth Vader does show up, but this time he is presented more as a Drath Veddar kind of character, heh heh...All in all, I did kinda like this one, simply because it was ultimately better than The Force Awakens...try it out, you might just like it...",7,0,0,16 December 2017
Passengers," This is an excellent movie, period !
","I always take the professional critic reviews with a grain of salt, because after all they get saturated with watching movies, and generally lose that natural magic feeling after a while...many of them definitely missed the mark on Passengers...A solid 8, that's what I gave Passengers. In the modern world of movie making, I have had a hard time finding one or two that really grab all the emotions...This is one of the best scifi movies I have seen recently. It possesses all the elements that make for excellent story telling, yet without all the space action the usual space epics have...in short, this is a love story, a well done science fiction story, a human condition story, and everything in between...all rolled into one extremely well told and entertaining narrative...One thing I noticed in some of the reviews, is the technical accuracy in the movie. By that I mean that much of the science implied is already being experimented with, so it isn't hard to relate to the movie from that perspective. But the story itself isn't really about science at all. It is totally about two people, and their lives on a star ship...No, I won't tell all the story, it needs to be seen to be appreciated completely. If you want fast paced movies, this is not it, but it does have a lot of fast action scenes woven in...and, some viewers will find the ending something of a let down. My housemate finally watched it, and she wanted more to the ending, heh heh...but even though it ends rather blandly, it is nonetheless very poignant...I am very glad they created this one...!!!",8,3,4,26 July 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Waste of time...
","Even worse than the first one, this outing was a total insult to any Star Trek fan...you would think that after failing with a poorly rehashed attempt at reinventing the franchise, Abrams would at least try to improve the experience. But no, he went even deeper into depravity and copied story elements from three separate classic episodes and one earlier motion picture to trash the new franchise worse than repairable...JJ has lost all hope of gaining a solid following, not to mention any respect for his work. I really don't expect to see much from him anymore...And no, I won't be watching the third one...",2,4,7,25 June 2016
The Natural," This is a movie for all time...
","This is not only a baseball movie, but also an in depth look at the human spirit...sorry to get all flowery, but the story reaches rather deeply into your soul.As a young man, Roy Hobbs is recruited as a baseball player, but while on his way to the team he makes the mistake of hooking up with a mysterious temptress who shoots him in a hotel...Years later, Roy gets another chance and is contracted to a B team, managed by Wilford Brimley, a crusty old guy who, at first, has little faith that this nobody can save his failing team...Through some carefully written dialog, and superb acting, the story takes the 'Knights' up to the pennant game...what happens in the closing minutes is spectacular, and reminds us all of the power that faith in oneself can bring...I love this movie, and really wish it had done better in the box office...",9,3,4,9 August 2017
Terminator Salvation," Good, but doesn't quite live up to the theme
","This was suppose to be an 'in between' movie, not a prequel nor really a sequel. I read somewhere that this was going to tie up some loose ends from the original and the Judgment Day movies, but unfortunately it leaves many more dangling loose ends than it ties up...I suppose the insertion of another Terminator, who doesn't know he is one, is someone's idea of mystery or intrigue, but it sure didn't do anything to make this more 'interesting' to me. Wow, and the first scene in Skynet's control room had me seeing Vickie from 'I Robot'. That felt like the writers didn't have enough imagination to handle this one. Oh well...I did give it a 7, but it just doesn't feel like a Terminator movie...good action.p.s. I thought I'd better put this in too, since someone is bound to notice...no, I didn't reference 3 movies, since I don't consider the T3 one to be 'worthy' if you will...the only part of T3 that impressed me at all is at the very end when 'John' realizes that the weight of the world really has landed on him...",7,0,0,11 March 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," I had to really laugh...
","...but I was laughing at some of the reviewers here frankly...Sure the movie is seriously overstated through much of its runtime, but it wasn't made as a semi-documentary anyway, so I do believe many missed the real intent of the movie, i.e. getting people to realize that climate change is very real. Each year we are seeing the earliest beginnings of changes that the deniers would have you believe is perfectly normal...and it really is not, simply because it is admittedly a slow change.So yes, the message was ultimately overstated, that a sudden catastrophic storm could threaten our existence, but the promise of long term threat is very real...Ok, enough environmental...the movie is seriously good entertainment on its own merits...",7,1,3,10 October 2018
The Terminator," After 35 years I still watch this...
","Yes there is good SciFi...but then if you bother looking long enough there is Great SciFi...I remember watching Terminator on that big screen, and could not take my eyes away or even blink most f the time. That is how perfect the movie is...and here it is 35 years later and I'm watching again for about the hundredth time...Yes, it was and is that good!",9,2,4,29 July 2019
Ready Player One," I've never been much of a video game player; but I thoroughly enjoyed this...
","This has enough mystery, puzzle solving to entertain any film detective; perhaps it's a good thing that I'm not a gamer, because I had fun with this movie...enough so that I actually bought it the second time...Presented in everyday dialog, with plenty of gamer words thrown in, I find it hard to believe that some avid players didn't like it. Visually it is stunning and personally, for once the CGI enhanced the story because it was all about just that in a way...",8,1,2,22 July 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fast action, but downright stupid otherwise...
","I watched the earlier trilogy, and thought of them as pretty darn good, even though I've never been a comic book fan. In fact, I'm not much of a Super Hero fan either...but I do like entertainment, and this version isn't it.There is a huge amount of fast action, which seems to please the kiddies, but hardly any useful story at all. You can't really get into the characters, and the dialog is plain cheesy. Nooo, this one doesn't deserve any high rating, and especially not as entertainment...",4,2,5,25 February 2018
Alien," The Penultimate Classic Space Horror Movie
","This is the one that set the bar very high for those movies to follow...After so many years, Alien grabs you right from the beginning. Casting was superb, special effects were way out there perfect, and the story simply could not be improved upon...The space commercial tug Nostromo, on it's way back from a stint of 'mineral mining' operations, is tasked by the 'company' to investigate a strange alien signal sent out from a planet not far from the tugs course. The crew is comprised of a Captain, First officer, two interestingly rebellious engineers, a planetary engineer, and a strange crew member who apparently is the ships medical Doctor, but later turns out to be a sinister company android.I won't go through the whole screenplay, but this movie was written with the twists and turns of Twilight Zone in mind, it is that good...One thing that amazed me over the years is the incredible detail put forth in the models of both the tug Nostromo, and the complete mining and processing platform it is towing. The exterior and interior shots of the space tug is quite simply 'believable'. It looks like a completely utilitarian workhorse, as it should. You could literally close your eyes and imagine being a crew member in the far future...Alien is the mark that all space operas must live up to now...",10,1,2,4 September 2016
Life of Pi," It is not often that a movie catches my attention like this one did...
","How does one put to words the emotions that Life of Pi generates? It ain't easy.At first I chose the movie on TV because there was nothing else on...literally! I caught it after it had started, when he was with his family on the ship (in the chow line no less). I thought, OK, just another half hearted attempt at making some money and went back to browsing on the 'pooter', thinking 'ho hum, better than watching a million reality shows anyway. Then the increased volume of the shipwreck made me look up. Never went back to the computer until the movie ended. Talk about grabbing you!The Life of Pi is decidedly slow moving, and necessarily so, in order to capture the fear, frustration and emotional roller coaster that being lost at sea can bring. Add wild animals into the mix, three of which don't last long, and you begin to create a very interesting story. Captivating is a good word...",Null,0,1,23 May 2015
Interstellar," I'm wondering how this got such a good rating...
","Interstellar has some good points, and some very bad points entertainment wise...First of all, the movie is extremely boring...which may tickle some people I suppose. Literally the first half of the movie is some sort of family affair for the stars, with shots of their flying a drone, and experiencing a huge dust storm at their big farm...only to have McGaunahey and his daughter go off searching for some ultra secret space base out in the boonies, where they find out there is a plan to go through a wormhole to somewhere else...Then we have a crazy robot that is a clone for the mystery obelisk in 2001. This robot never does anything much,except wiggle its segments and occasionally respond to voice...Then the trip into space, on a Saturn 5 rebuild, that links up to a spacecraft fixture in space, which promptly begins revolving to produce pseudo-gravity...A boring flight out to Saturn, through the wormy hole, and we arrive at somewhere else, supposedly a planet...land 'in' the water, get thrashed by a tsunami, and here we are...still no solid plot at all...I remember watching the movie Contact, which was boring in it's own way, but this one is ten times worse...only one step above awful...",2,5,11,9 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I'll never learn...
","This is probaly the fifth time I rented a movie on impulse, and while I was bored...and regretted it not even 10 minutes into watching...yes, I should know better after being disappointed so many times, but believe it or not some movies that were rated badly here were actually quite entertaining for me...Not so for the re-imagined Star Wars...I saw the original Episode 4 when it came out big screen, and wanted that feeling of magic, but alas it is not to be so...this one stinks so badly I will likely press stop in another 5 minutes or so and never go back to it again...grand total maybe twenty minutes for $4.99 rental fee...Of well, at least there were a few seconds of good CGI...",3,23,35,13 April 2020
Pacific Rim," You either love it or hate it...
","Gee, Transformers meets Godzilla...I never thought I'd see old Japanese monster movies from the 50's and 60's again, but here it is!!!There is no real middle ground for this movie. It is either love it or hate it. You can't say 'Wayul, it has some cool visuals so it has to be amazing', or'Geeee, what a cool story'...because it isn't.This movie plays out very much like a slow moving video game. It has no catchy plot, only that some weird, huge monster characters invade the Earth from deep under the sea (Pacific to be exact...hence the title, wow is that creative or what), and a force of huge manned robot kinda machines, reminiscent of Transformers have been created to battle the threat. You really have to exercise your imagination to even understand the main plot let alone the whole story here. It just doesn't compare as an epic...I gave it a 5 for trying, nothing more...",5,1,1,14 April 2016
Empire of the Sun," While slow moving in parts, still a powerful movie...
","This had Spielberg written all over it, and rightfully so...it is his trademark to make you think when you see his movies...Empire of The Sun does just that, makes you reflect on your own life while watching a young boy grow up far too early in a war that is legend now.I expect many to disrespect the movie, simply because they don't have the patience to see the underlying story...",8,0,2,10 January 2019
Forrest Gump," Soul Searching 101...
","Many of us go through our entire lives never really seeing the world. I don't mean the world in News reports, or on TV...I mean the beautiful world, the simple world, beyond the the hatred and dissatisfaction that assaults our senses every day. The beautiful and uncluttered world as seen through Forrest Gump's eyes.OK, enough flowery talk. This movie will mean different things to different people, there is no doubt in my mind. For some it will be seen as nothing more than a patronizing joke, a crude attempt to make people think our world should be a fantasy land. I feel sorry for them, as they just don't get the simple message that shines throughout the movie.For others (I hope we are a majority), we see Forrest as a gateway to our own soul. Forrest Gump experiences all the hurt, the hatred, the huge brick wall of insecurity that we all experience. Yet he continues on, finding a strength within to overcome all the obstacles placed before him...Maybe we aren't perfect, maybe we don't know all the answers, but Forrest Gump lets you know that we don't have to be perfect to see the beauty all around us. Just look! I find myself watching this movie every time I see that it is on...",10,1,1,1 June 2012
"Monsters, Inc."," Marvelously entertaining...
","There are some very good reviews here already, just thought I'd add my two cents worth. I was surprised to find out how many creative pains went into the making of Monsters, Inc. I suppose that is a necessity to get a movie 'just right', and this one does! Monsters, Inc is a cartoon certainly, but even if you don't like cartoons you can immerse yourself in the character's antics. I do like classic cartoons, not the modern clap trap they show now, and this movie just tickles every emotion you can think of...in an entirely intelligent way at that. I watch this one every time it shows on TV. Heck, I even find myself watching it when there is a competing movie on in my favorite genre, Scifi!!!",10,0,1,29 July 2012
Ant-Man," Delightfully weird...
","When I first saw this showing in my TV lineup, I was looking for anything that might seem interesting...I'm rather glad I gave it 5 minutes, because I watched the whole thing, heh heh...This is not the standard Marvel Weirdness, but rather a special weirdness that grabs your funny nerve if you stick with it. The plot is sorta strange, but the dry humor sneaks up on you, and you find yourself laughing at the quick one liners.Michael Douglas was outstanding as the eccentric, yet not too eccentric scientist, who discovered a way to communicate with ants, and invents a neat super suit that shrinks someone down to ant size, while giving them super strength as well...I know, the concept is out there, but once you get into the story it definitely grabs you completely...Rudd is the ex-con who steals the super suit, finding out later that the mad scientist planned for him to, heh heh...The story is weird, the acting top notch, and Antman will give you some seriously funny entertainment...",8,0,0,17 September 2017
Oblivion," Can't I hope that a good movie will show eventually???
","I keep trying to find that one good scifi movie that will pay us back for all the drivel that occupies the movie industry lately.Wayul, this one isn't it!!! Tremendously slow moving through most of the movie, Oblivion never really captures your imagination. It is missing the most critical piece for any scifi movie, a solid plot that you can follow but not predict.This plot is simply choppy, with Tom Cruise spending much of the time flying around in a suped up flitter bug/combination jet with a anti-rotation helicopter tail rotor. There are a mix of quick action scenes straight out of a Nintendo game, sewed together with uninspiring fill in love making and background Earth devastation plot that never makes sense. Morgan Freeman tries mightily to explain the entire movie plot in 5 minutes of dialog, but comes up way short of saving this one. In fact, Morgan Freeman is the only one who I found interesting at all.Maybe it's just because I'm an OLD (ok, ancient) scifi fanatic, but can't I hope that there will be at least one more good (or great) scifi movie from this current generation of movie peoples??? Perhaps, but I'm getting real tired of drivel!",3,1,6,25 August 2013
Man of Steel," Just another remake that falls short...
","Ritualistic, stylistic and not much more. Full of Smash, bash, beat 'em up and destruction, it will surely please all the immature little kids out there...but it doesn't do much for the moderately intelligent. Stan Lee did his infamous bit performance here, so he probably approved the outing. Or is it perhaps that he is becoming desperate. No matter, he is becoming a liability rather than the anchor he once was in the Fantasy genre.Man of Steel is chock full of action, but very empty in the areas of back story and character building. In this film no character is sacred, especially Superman himself. Relying solely upon visuals, there isn't any real story line to grab onto. We are treated to more astounding technological wizardry that isn't explained certainly, and scene after scene of monumental fighting and destruction, but only one or two scenes total showing the Superman soul...as I said in the Summary, just another remake that falls short.",5,2,4,25 February 2016
The Thing," Very Possibly the greatest Horror Movie ever produced...
","The use of eerie music and visuals is superb; John Carpenter had a clear vision of what he wanted to create...while this version only touches on the original's plot, it does so to actually enhance the story. CGI was only a glint in someones eye at the time, and if you blink you miss the fact that they used no CGI at all.Yes, this is definitely a masterpiece of the highest order, and reminds the viewer that the very best horror movies are all in the presentation; both visually and psychologically",9,4,7,21 July 2019
Armageddon," Good action, but where's the science?
","Ohhh, this one is a visual masterpiece alright...but believability took a vacation big time. First off, asteroids simply don't look like that, except perhaps in an artists tortured mind, nor do they act like this one does. Also, shuttles don't fly like fighter planes in space, banking and maneuvering like the infamous Battle Star Galactica fighters. Secondly, NASA just happens to have not one but two 'shuttles' of a never seen before design sitting around begging to be used. Third, but probably most telling, is that the NASA people can't seem to do much of anything right, so they have to recruit Harry and his crew to save the planet in only 18 days...with a unique little compact drilling rig that NASA conveniently 'stole' from Harry himself but can't get working right...and the obligatory Nuclear weapon that just so happens to be the right size to fit into the hole they drill.Ohhh, and don't forget the old decrepit Russian 'gas station' parked in orbit that conveniently can refuel both shuttles, complete with its own 'attendant', an eccentric and grumpy old codger who believes the only correct solution for anything mechanical or electronic is to give it a good bashing with whatever wrench is handy.Well, you get the picture I suppose. The movie is actually quite entertaining in its own way, if you leave your brain at home and forget any hint of common sense.",5,1,1,20 August 2015
The Revenant," What it is supposed to be, and what it is, are two different things...
","I can see why it went to streaming sites so quickly. In my humble opinion, the only reason why it made some money, is because many people were hyped (conned) into going to see it.Frankly, The Revenant looked to me more like a poor imitation of Jeremiah Johnson. Most of the movie is slow, and really drab. Most of the time I acually felt like I was watching a movie shot in black and white, there is that little color in it...If they wanted to do a survivalist movie, they should have cast a survivalist...",4,1,2,2 August 2018
Knowing," I had to think about this one for quite a while...
","There are movies Nicholas Cage is good in...this was alright, but not his usual fare...Somewhat spiritual in nature, Knowing fell a bit short for me with the changes in direction..while it is a watchable film, it just does not measure up as memorable, although there are some good parts near the end...",7,0,0,20 March 2020
"I, Robot"," Looks good, but as usual the book is better
","When I was quite young, some 55 years ago, I read the book 'I Robot' and it hooked me on science fiction.While this movie is a far cry from the book premise it does remain true to the 'Three Law' concept...actually, the movie takes you on a tour of the consequences of robots circumventing the three laws. After a respected Scientist dies from a fall out of a very tall building, the cop is tasked to investigate. After a long but not dull lead up to who 'murdered' the Doctor, we find out some very interesting variations on how robots could run amok...It's a pretty entertaining movie, but if you pick up the original book, and read it through, then you'll enjoy it more.",8,1,2,21 March 2012
Heartbreak Ridge," I am disappointed...but not with the movie...
","I'm old school Military...no, not a Marine, but I served alongside them often, so I do have insights into Heartbreak Ridge...Yes the movie is a fictional story, yes it is dramatized...but there is one thing that seems to have been missed by some of the reviewers here...militarily, and specifically from the Marine perspective, the movie is NOT overacted. The concept of the Marine Code of Honor is frankly spot on despite some of the dialog glitches. So I don't care if some missed the point entirely, if you don't get it I doubt anyone could explain it to you...Semper Fi Marines...",8,0,1,26 March 2020
Ender's Game," A Surprisingly Good Adaptation of a book...
","I'll say it again...this isn't a book review site folks, but I do understand your inner turmoil...Unlike Starship Troopers, which didn't even try to reflect the book (see my review of THAT one), the producers of Enders Game really worked at respecting the Authors story line. I suspect screen play writers and directors cringe when being signed on to a book based movie. It's only natural that something in the original story must be left behind, otherwise you'd have 4 hour movies all the time. I have to applaud these movie crafters however, they really went the extra mile to remain within the original vision. Without giving out too many spoilers, Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley did rather well as the Colonel and Earths greatest hero Mazer. After seeing Harrison in that stink bomb Cowboys vs Aliens I was disillusioned, but he came through on this one. SciFi movies are but a sideline for Ben, but he really went out of the way to make his character totally believable (especially going through the uncomfortable makeup sessions to make him an all out Maori warrior, head to toe!). You gotta love an actor who gives his all to the character, heh heh...While it won't ever grab Oscars, this outing was very pleasing to a book reader who only picked up Enders Game as an after thought.Nooo, this isn't a rehash of the book...but it does a respectable job of simulating the book, so lighten up a bit...",8,0,1,26 January 2016
Aliens," It doesn't get any better...
","Well, actually it was the first Alien movie that set the bar very high. But this is a sequel you can be proud of too. After 57 years (movie timeline that is) Siguorney (Ripley) is back at it, this time having been 'rescued' from the Nostromos lifeboat only to find that her report falls on deaf 'company' ears.After being doubted to the point of ridicule, she finds a job on starship loading docks, her starship 'license' having been revoked as senior officer. After a few weeks she is contacted by a company rep that wants her to accompany a rescue mission with some tough (hombres') space marines. She finally agrees, and off we go on an exciting journey that is both exciting and scary at points throughout the movie...it was fun to watch and we get reintroduced to Michael Biehns well done acting...a very good movie!",9,0,1,27 March 2016
Now You See Me," Oooooo, some people didn't like this one...
","Doesn't matter really, this was produced to entertain, nothing more...and the twists and turns definitely did that. Some complained it had no coherent story, but frankly it does...I guess you hafta be as crazy as I am to appreciate it though...Ok, enough for now...I'm watching it again...",7,0,0,29 April 2020
Pearl Harbor," 12 years later, and it still insults the viewing public...
","Where to start, such a dilemma. I suppose I could start at the beginning, but unfortunately the first five minutes is the only good part in the entire movie! The rest is, shall we say, less than stellar. Never mind that only twenty minutes is spent on the attack of Pearl Harbor...never mind that those twenty minutes had only one accurate fact (Yes kiddies, Cuba Gooding did get the one 'vaguely accurate' portrayal in the entire movie), never mind that they try to get you to believe that two fighter pilots suddenly become qualified multi-engine, medium bomber pilots in order to participate in the Doolittle raid on Japan...never mind that those same two pilots were flying Curtis P-40 Tomahawks during the attack on Pearl Harbor, AND matching the Japanese flying Zero's (Two real life pilots DID take off from Haleiwa field during the attack. After calling ahead to get their planes ready,they drove 12 miles and jumped right into their cockpits, then downed 5 attacking planes. So that was vaguely accurate, although P-40's were never as maneuverable as they were depicted in the movie)......Well, you get the idea anyway. This movie was crap from the start, and should have been banned from ever being shown at all.",1,2,3,10 January 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Huge on hype...weak on delivery...
","I just got back from seeng this on the big screen; first time to a movie house in 40 years.I will start by saying I do like Marvel and their superheroes...that being said, I felt Infinity Wars was too fast paced and lacked a coherent storyline. With all the hype for Endgame I was expecting a similar fast pace...only to be amazed at how boring the first half of the movie was. YES kiddies, a full hour and a half was literally 'snoozy time' when it comes to any story at all. To tell the truth, at one point about an hour into this I was thinking I was supposed to be thinking up excuses for why there was nothing of substance going on...For the entire three hour time frame, there could not have been more than 15% total with action of any amount in scenes; and that felt more like it was thrown in as an apology...frankly, I expected more; much much more than was delivered...at least all the characters who disappeared in Infinity Wars came back in Endgame...The short opinion...Huge Disappointment!",4,26,40,10 May 2019
Independence Day," Too many comedians really...
","I went to see this in the big screen, and it was pretty good...except, when I thought about it some, I realized that all the comedians were competing for the best one liners through much of the movie. That detracted from the overall experience for me personally...The story line is right out of the classic 'aliens come to take over the Earth' theme, but with considerable panache this time. It seems the entire alien race lives on this humongous star ship, and even have smaller attack 'shuttles' that are still 15 miles in diameter...All the actors are household names in their own right, but in this case putting them all in the same movie, each one trying to out do the other was a letdown really...Otherwise, the acting is presentable, the CGI rather well done, and it was an enjoyable experience overall...",6,2,4,9 October 2017
Alien vs. Predator," I liked it much more than I thought I would...
","Frankly, when I see any new remake, or in this case 'merging of two movie themes', I usually expect a poorly done show with just making money as the goal. In AVP I was pleasantly surprised however. Taking the best of both themes from Alien and Predator, this merging was done intelligently and with considerable thought to a detailed story line.The 'Hunters' seeded Earth with the dreaded Alien species thousands of years ago with the intent to create a hunting preserve of sorts. Although it isn't stated specifically, it never the less is unmistakable in the translations of the pyramid glyphs. So much for my spoiler...As I said, this one surprised me, and I actually watch it every time it comes on TV. The mutual respect developed between our heroine and the hunters is a very nice addition to the story as well...",8,1,1,21 November 2011
Legends of the Fall," An Exceptional Film
","This was a departure from my usual love, SciFi. While I wasn't glued to the TV screen, I did watch most all of it, and found it to be a well thought out and produced movie. I am not normally a fan of Brad Pitt but enjoyed his performance quite a bit. Anthony Hopkins is superb, as he always is, giving his all to the character. The rest of the cast, while I'm not as familiar with them, were excellent in bringing the story to life.I liked Legends of the Fall, and will undoubtedly watch it again. The story qualifies as mesmerizing, covering not only the personal lives of the main characters and their inner turmoil, but to an extent also touches on the unparalleled horrors of war. Well written and performed.",8,2,2,15 February 2015
District 9," Apartheid all over again...
","There are an inordinate number of glowing reviews on here, that just don't match the actual quality in the movie...did Blomkamp hire every South African to run right over and provide these reviews??? I don't know, but there can't be that many degenerates in the IMDb world, to account for those glowing ones, heh heh...to be honest, there are some good CGI moments sprinkled throughout District 9, but the story itself is entirely Apartheid...but this time it isn't Blacks who are the underdogs, it is a spaceship full of insects, who spend most of their time vomiting or stealing, or just trying to be annoyingly gross...Sorry folks, but this was a rude, crude, under the top movie direct from South Africa...And it should have stayed there...",4,1,3,19 October 2017
Toy Story 4," I'm kinda sad...but not because of the movie...
","I frankly can't believe all the negative comments. I've seen so many sequels over the years, most tend to lose their magnetism as the stories continue, but not this one! Toy Story 4 actually improves on the originalsMaybe it's because I tend to be snarky with my humor, I got the bouncy bouncy feeling right off...there is alot of snarky humor in this one because it was written that way...you can feel the emotions that would run through a toy if they really did come to life...I thought this was done creatively and with the kid in all of us in mind...Oh, so maybe I never really grew up, but for a 72 year 'old guy' it brought back the child in me...so there!!",8,0,0,31 March 2020
Saving Private Ryan," An excellent movie, period...
","First off, I liked this movie. Spielberg went the distance to create the real pain and terror of war with this panorama of death and bloodshed. The twenty minutes of Normandy footage is the most realistic I have ever seen, They cast real people with lost limbs to show how battles are carnage, not pretty scenery. Also, without making it obvious they showed how the invasion was completely thrown off track with airborne drops way off the intended marks. Simply put, the detail is authentic for every minute throughout the movie.Certainly, Saving Private Ryan was never intended to be a documentary. The individual plot is, of course, total fiction. Yet the plot is, and never was, the focus of the movie. The focus rather, is the individual honor that comes from deep within the human psyche, the fear and anger that was prevalent through the ranks. This is a movie about us in a way...",10,1,4,13 April 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Very well done, even for a die hard original POTA watcher...
","I watched all the original POTA movies when they came out, so you can imagine I wasn't exactly confident I would enjoy this reboot. I was surprised at how taken I was with this movie. It felt every bit as new and exciting as the original.If you remember Escape from The Planet of the Apes, you'll appreciate how difficult it is to accept a completely different origin for Caesar. No space ship, no intelligent ape parents from the future, no Carnival Owner a.k.a step father; ROTPOTA has a totally new concept/theme to account for the prelude of Apes taking over the Earth. With the recent garbage truck full of poorly thought out and executed reboots, this one grabs the imagination right away, with excellent writing and direction. Sure, there are a few seemingly meaningless nods to the original through some inappropriate dialog 'borrowed' from the originals, but essentially you can allow them as momentary lapses in judgment. Get past those and the movie stands well on it's own dialog and acting/CGI merging. The final scene is particularly moving and pretty well timed. No, not gonna tell you about that, heh heh...this is by far the best reboot in 30 years!",9,1,3,23 December 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," Ummm, did they forget a plot?
","Sorry folks, but I'm not one of those people who goes, 'Yaaaayyyy, WOW, Super Cool, every time there is an action sequence...me, I like a movie with a coherent plot behind it; something that characters can build on...and I'm not seeing it here...There is action sequence after action sequence, but no real why to latch onto. We have every super hero in the Marvel Universe either fighting some nondescript super villians or fighting amongst themselves...and not any solid story to follow...Oh, I understand that Kronos is suppose to be wanting to be the King of the Universe, or something like that; be let's be real here. why is there so much hooray for this movie just because it has a Marvel Intro to start it...I guess I just don't understand fanatical cults...Marvel actually pulled out the stops, engaged every super hero ever, and threw a bunch of action together to please their fans...apparently it worked from the ratings I'm seeing...",7,2,3,27 December 2018
2012," Highly improbable, but entertaining anyway...
","If I were to rate this movie strictly on science or believability it would be a 2, but ultimately I found 2012 to be rather entertaining. The CGI was superb throughout, and surprisingly the acting was OK, but the story itself was not so hot and very overdone. If you want scenes of total devastation and cataclysm this outing will thrill you, for the CGI is superb and almost terrifyingly realistic.While the story itself is lacking, you can at least relate it to the headlines in the news sometimes. It is the ultimate disaster movie no doubt, and if you leave your cape of reality at home you can enjoy it thoroughly...",6,1,1,22 April 2016

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force Awakens was poor quality...
","...So they decided to kill the franchise all together...Star Wars is dead, long live Star Wars !!!Truthfully, for a viewer who saw the first episode (IV) on the big screen, this is sheer torture...there is literally nothing in this movie that I would consider a saving grace...nothing...We have a Leia who can live in the vacuum of space...we have a Luke, who can't fiugure out what he wants to be, so spends much of the mivie all somber, dark and emotionally void...we have Chewie, acing like he doesn't want to be chewie anymore...And then all the new guys start acting like they are the Power Rangers or something...Honestly, THIS IS NOT STARWARS!!!",3,9,14,3 September 2018
Brave," A delightful flight into fantasy...
","I am frankly amazed at the many negative reviews, half blaming Pixar for being Pixar and the other half blaming Disney for latching onto Pixar...This movie isn't Wall-e, and I doubt they ever intended it to be similar. Where Wall-e had a moral picking at the recesses of your mind all the way through, Brave has a very subtle message, that is neither flaunted nor shoved at you...The movie treats you to pure entertainment, with no agenda either apparent nor implied. Perhaps that is what all the negative reviewers were looking for, an agenda...instead, what is presented to you is a simple story of a family that learns, on several levels, what being family is all about...It isn't tradition, it is Pixar through and through...",8,0,1,6 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Big Screen Comic Book...
","To appreciate GOTG you must disconnect from the real world, and explore the world of comic books...to be honest, it took five times watching the movie to realize I wasn't supposed to be watching a movie. This is a big screen comic book, with so-called 'normal people' and bizarre aliens, fantasy creatures, spectacular graphics, super human exploits, but no coherent story...to put it into analogy, until you understand the intended 'feel', watching is much like having a dislocated shoulder. It hurts like he!!, until you sit back and relax...then it just aches a bit, until you get used to the watching...Oh, there is a story of sorts, but it is buried deeply within all the fast paced action. In fact, the story is very choppy, something like mincing an onion, heh heh...you really aren't supposed to be able to follow the story though. You're just supposed to have fun...And ultimately, you do...",7,0,1,12 July 2017
Jurassic World," This was someone's idea of a joke, right ??
","If the hour and a half I saw is an indication, then I'm glad I didn't see every minute of this one...Frankly, I can only presume that all those 10 ratings came as a result of one or two reasons...either someone paid a bunch of people to praise this disaster, or some of them never saw the original, or the sequels...Very very bland, for a supposed honor to one of the best movies ever...in the time I was watching, there were only 10 minutes of a dinosaur, or two. Perhaps it is the first hour that has all the exciting action everybody else is talking about, but I saw the last 2/3 of it and it was a big yawn for me...And what's with the riding around the island on motorcycles...and who thought up using raptors as hound dogs, to find the T-rex they apparently lost, heh heh...Truly, there is little to praise JW for...certainly not a coherent story, nor the mediocre acting...even the CGI was not up to par with the originals...it just turned out to be a nothing movie...",3,7,9,4 October 2017

Elysium," District 9, without the bugs...
","Whenever fairly big name stars get conned into a mediocre project their portrayals always seem strained, like they really need to visit the bathroom quick? That was certainly the case here. Jodie Fosters presentation looked more like 'When will this disaster be finished so I can go home', rather than what her character needed to make her performance believable. Matt Damon at least tried to deliver his dialog in some believable fashion, occasionally expressing some genuine emotion.Or perhaps it is the theme and background to this story. It was delivered in the same inane way that District 9 was done, with about the same result...which is to say it had none. At least no coherent story to speak of. It is more of a collection of taped up scenes with no real direction in mind. Sure, there is a story or two in there somewhere, but they are buried with so much useless dialog and a bit of CGI thrown in that it is near impossible to figure out what happened to the world.I thought I was being generous by giving it a 4 rating...",4,0,2,18 October 2015
Avatar," An Amazing journey
","I sometimes can't understand why so many thought Avatar was less than amazing. I do understand that people have differing views, but darn! Sure, the plot has some vague similarities to other movies, but how can anyone say they were 'stolen' plots? Every 'great' movie I ever saw had similarities in both emotional presentation and character development. Oh well, to each their own view...mine is that Avatar deserves nothing less than a 10, both in creativity and delivery.i know I was mesmerized from the start, and quite frankly didn't realize that three hours had past. I can't wait for the promised sequel, thank you James!",10,3,6,30 July 2013
Total Recall," Totally better than the new crappy version...
","After seeing the 2012 Version of Total Recall, I just had to time travel back to 1990 and review the original...There simply is no comparison that can be applied to the two movies. Arnie's Total Recall has all the elements that make for a very entertaining film, where the newer one has none of it...this movie has dynamic, location scenes, good acting (if a bit over the top), and frankly always has your attention...the new one has none of that either...So ultimately, trying to compare these two versions would be like comparing a one pound hamburger to a one pound pile of hay. It just does not compute, heh heh...",8,1,2,29 August 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," I liked it, and am proud to have liked it...
","One reviewer said they went 180 degrees on this one, and I agree...While the first installment was literally a big screen comic book, with lots of action and very little story line, Volume 2 showed Guardians with a soul, plain and simple. There was still a fair amount of over the top action, but now we also see the characters for who they are as well, frail humans and aliens (and Racoon and Baby Tree), with fears and real feelings. So, I really do understand all the negative comments...I wouldn't expect die hard comic book fans to feel any other way. But I fall into another category, one that expects a movie to first and foremost entertain me with a story...which this one does...Sure, it is much slower moving than the original, and that is certainly a shock. But it redeems itself by showing the characters to be something more than comic book heroes...and for that consideration I gave it a solid 8...so there !!",8,2,4,4 September 2017
The Da Vinci Code," I like it, but don't understand all of the mystery...
","I find myself watching this movie on TV every time it shows. Each time I find out a little more about what confuses me within the plot. I suspect that many have the same problem, since the overall rating is lower than I expected...The DaVinci Code follows a fairly straightforward storyline, yet gets convoluted quite easily trying to follow the clues along with Professor Langdon. I suppose another movie could have been made just to explain the Holy Grail line of thought, although they did try somewhat.Still, the movie does hold you within it's mysterious grip. I know I like it, so I gave it an 8...",8,0,0,12 August 2012
War of the Worlds," Just another remake that fails...
","No matter how many times I try to like this, it just isn't happening. Perhaps it is the miscasting. Just like Keanu Reaves should never have been in The Day The Earth Stood Still, Tom Cruise ultimately was a dud in this remake.Perhaps it was the cut and paste feel to this version of a classic SciFi thriller. In the original 60's movie, Gene Barry was an astrophysicist yet Stephen S. decided to make Tom C. a dock worker with an attitude? They lost a lot of credibility right there. Sure, some of the plot elements parallel the original but not quite enough. The story line just didn't have the same feel of tension and fear, or at least the changes did not carry the same 'grab you' aura. I'm just losing interest in all these classic remakes that fall flat. Some liked it I guess, to have managed a 6.4 average.",4,2,5,24 May 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers...
","This movie is so bizarrely ridiculous, it actually gets entertaining...The first five minutes of action reminds you of Star Ship Troopers, with fast moving bugs killing everyone in sight...In fact, all the action scenes resemble that slug of a movie...but the underlying plot is every bit Groundhog Day, with Tom Cruise reliving the same horrible day of carnage over and over, with slight differences each time, because the 'Alpha bug' infected him with it's own blood when Cruise killed it the first time...You can never say this is a great movie, but once you get over the unbelievable parts that infest the first 45 minutes or so, it actually starts grabbing your attention...ending up being rather entertaining.I did give it a 6, even tho' it is a watch once movie...",6,1,3,12 November 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Why did I think this might be good...
","For those of you who thought dumb movies were a thing of the past, fear not, they saved one just for you...This has got to be the dumbest Kong movie ever made, far surpassing the 1976 version of King Kong...The plot is so bizarre, taking place supposedly in the 60's, during Vietnam, and the characters provide some of the dumbest moves in the movie. They actually fly all their helicopters at, and around Kong, as if to say, 'take me take me, knock me to the ground. Of course, Kong obliges them, grabbing or knocking every chopper out of the air...And they actually used a tanker ship for this one too !!!",3,0,2,17 February 2018
Arrival," Not your average Scifi movie...
","I confess, I had to watch this three times before the story started to sink in to my Scifi saturated brain...yes kiddies, this is another very slow moving movie, where you must really pay attention to figure out what it is about...Yes folks, I am a Science Fiction junkie...and I'm proud of that, as I believe it gives me a good understanding of the different ways alien contact is portrayed. While most have presented aliens as the nemesis, always a threat in real time, Arrival instead goes in a different direction entirely...This movie isn't about alien threats, space battles, or any of that. Instead, it is a thesis on our own human paranoia. You don't know what the aliens want, unless you can communicate with them, soooo...Enter the linguistics expert, our prime character, who has been tasked by the government to figure out how to talk to the aliens. The movie is very slow moving, has no battles, and if it has a message at all, it is that we are our own worst enemy, as always...So the bottom line is that I did like it...but it does take a few viewings to get the message...**Update**I managed to watch it again for the fourth time, and well...I still can't say I like it as a classic SciFi example...but it is still ok as a drak movie with a not so hidden message...",6,0,3,20 August 2017
Platoon," Quite good...but
","Platoon does a nice job of balancing reality with Hollywood theater. The atmosphere is pretty much spot on, with only a few scenes going a bit over the top. The 'war' in Vietnam was supposed to be a somewhat normal 'by the book' conflict, but everyone on the ground found out fast that the rule book just wasn't translated into Vietnamese. The characters portray the general feelings that persisted through much of the war, including the in fighting and back stabbing in some units. It was a brutal, non-standard conflict, and it reflects that reality all the way through the movie...But...the movie also crosses the line by implying that the conduct of the soldiers in Platoon is somehow justified. As the years after Vietnam have come and gone, we are seeing more and more incidents where American soldiers are not holding to the conduct that built this nation. Iran. Afghanistan and Pakistan are merely the latest examples of how our own moral values have been left by the wayside.Anyway, overall this movie is gratingly accurate in showing the realities of 'modern warfare' on the ground. I liked it, but it also made me cringe at the same time. Perhaps that is the real intent of the movie, and it does make you rethink your own values...",7,0,0,4 March 2012
Prometheus," After finally seeing this, I'm actually disappointed...
","One reviewer mentioned it already, but the acting was not up to par. 'Two dimensional'? I wouldn't give them that much really, even Fassbender. He did a passable job as an android, but sheesh! Rapace could have done something more original, not a Ripley clone! And I thought all through the movie that the blonde was the supposed 'Captain', but no. The pilot really was, for as soon as he says he's going to ram the alien ship, she goes running for an escape capsule! Ohhh, I get it. She indicates she is Weyland's daughter, so Daddy gave her a whole big ship to play with! And the pilot! He spends the whole movie looking like some extra they hired, then suddenly he's a hero? Please!!! And to make it worse, two other flight crew join him, both of them treating dying as just another job. Totally unbelievable really.In another scene, we have two 'scientists' treating a new alien animal as if it were some cute little puppy dog, heh heh...I mean, seriously, these two actually lean closer so the snake looking thingy can attack them more easily...come on, too stupid to be believed...No, I wasn't impressed with this outing in the 'Alien' universe. And here's why: Far too many reused pieces of dialog from all the Alien films. I detested the call 'We are LEAVING!' That line belongs to Michael Biehn, and him alone, it was so well delivered! Too many recognizable scenes from other Alien films. I won't describe the entire movie, so you judge for yourself. It actually looked like they cut and pasted the script at times, for crying out loud.One particular scene has always bugged me too. When the Prometheus rams the Engineers ship, it is a mile or more from Rapace and the Captain...so how is it that the alien ship drops right on top of the two ? A really big glitch for me and continuity...At least they had some very good CGI visuals throughout, that's the best I can give them...I paid my 20 bucks for the DVD Mr Scott, so you made some money off me. Now I understand the reasoning behind holding back the release, more chance to con as much as you could out of it.Someone actually started a comments topic as to people feeling that film makers owe the audience. GEE, what a novel idea!!! Of course they owe us stupid! If we didn't expect quality, we wouldn't buy, would we. This movie was not quality Mr Scott",5,2,4,12 October 2012

After about 1 hour, I'm still trying to figure out if this is a Black musical, Black culture movie, a Crime solvers movie, or a bizarre ethereal movie...'cause it sure as heck isn't a super hero movie, which I thought it was supposed to be...The plot, if you can find it, seems to be about a wannabe super hero, that people saw in another movie (I didn't, sorry), who goes back to his mysterious, technological country, that happens to be invisible, to do something that I never did figure out, but was sorta explained in the synopsis, that didn't make sense to me anyway...So, you see, I'm rather lost on how to give this one a knowledgeable review...But I tried, heh heh...**Update 45 minutes later**Ok, I think I figured out why this movie is so slap dash boring to me...apparently Marvel decided to produce Black Panther as only an International (foreign) release, so it doesn't fit into an American concept of a superhero movie...then decided to subtitle half the movie, and released it in the US too...THAT is as much sense as I can make out of it all...",3,1,3,6 September 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," What do you do...
","...when all the super heroes have saved the world a thousand times over? Why, pit them against each other of course! I'm not terribly excited over the premise really. In fact, the idea of making enemies out of the two coolest heroes makes me cringe. In one respect I can respect what the producer wants to convey here, suspicion, uncertainty of a world in turmoil, seeking hope and understanding perhaps...but only if they tread very carefully with a compelling story. And there you have what has been missing for quite some time, more real story lines. Don't pack the movie full of huge action scenes only to leave the story back at the studio...please! I actually hope they succeed with this attempt...**Update July 18 2016**Yes, I have seen this flop...Nooo, I will not be buying this on DVD...while I did hope they would get this one right, as opposed to the Man of Steel fail, I was apparently right in my premonition. I didn't think pitting two of the best superheroes ever against each other was a good idea...after reading a fair sampling of the reviews here it is obvious to me that it was in fact a poor idea.Fans were rather impressed with their actors performances, or rather their showing up on screen at least, so I can relate to that. But overall, most were unhappy with how the story was treated...so I'll leave it at that...well, one more thing! I cannot believe they actually had Batman with GLOWING EYES, and a gravelly voice...**For IMDb Staff- If, in the future, when you get an abuse report from another user, would you please investigate that user before deleting my reviews.

Bruce Almighty," Clap on, clap off...

Besides being an irreverant genius with comedy, Carrey actually acting depth as well, something refreshing in a method that few can emulate...I liked this one, and am proud of that...",9,0,0,3 September 2018
Lucy," A Bizarre Flight of Fantasy, but WOW...
","I'm giving it an 8, just because I've watched it three times, and it still has my attention...This is a rather dry and subdued look at the potential power of the human mind, and I'm one of those ten percent that find it fascinating...Lucy takes her boyfriend's place as a narcotics 'mule', ends up with a large bag of blue drug surgically inserted in her stomach cavity. The bag leaks, and she begins a transformation into a super mind, with bizarre mental powers materializing throughout the flick.Now, like I said before, this is a rather dry and bizarre movie, so it won't appeal to a huge audience. The ending is something of a let down for superhero fanatics, but I found it appropriate in maintaining the subdued atmosphere...I find that I really do like this one...**Update** Heh heh, I'm watching it for about the eighth time tonight 20 November, and it is still exciting to watch...",8,12,19,11 June 2017
Midway," I'm gonna stick my neck out again...
","While it is flashy and cinematically correct (that's a back handed way of saying technically appealing), there are none the less two things wrong with this version of history...maybe I should have said 'problems', for the first is CGI. This vehicle can do some amazing things when showing fantasy worlds, but here they forgot to pay attention to how planes actually fly. The attempt in this movie was to make amazing battle scenes, but they didn't impress me.The second problem is you and me...we sometimes forget that there were real people fighting and dying over the four days of the battle. It's only my opinion certainly, but I could not empathize at all with some of the portrayals. Yes I'm gona say it; Woody Harrelson should never have been cast as Chester Nimitz...!In summary, I didn't like it...yes I'm a Navy veteran too...",6,1,4,10 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not Star Wars, not even close...
","There are some fairly cool action sequences, but overall the movie pays no honor to the originals. A good percentage of the film is comprised of boring scene after boring scene, with horrendously poor acting.And having Harrison Ford in this actually detracted from the overall feel. We all have to admit that he's getting old, and he simply cannot live up to the Han Solo mystique...**Update** I'm changing my assessment of Harrison and Chewie a bit, they did make for a few minutes of fun ala' the original...but, I'm afraid he needs to step away from Star Wars for good...Carrie Fisher, nooooo...her contribution seemed to be standing around waiting for someone to feed her some lines, nothing more...I looked and looked, but I couldn't find an actor amongst the bunch of new faces who were credited as front line actors, and the plot was so convoluted as to be non existent.I was being charitable by giving it a 4, frankly...",4,23,58,5 August 2017
The Truman Show," The Ultimate Reality Show...
","...before there were reality shows. While I'm sure it wasn't intended, this movie is the perfect spoof of all reality shows, and demonstrates just how ridiculous they really are.Truman is a man who was 'enlisted' at birth to be the sole focus of a new wave in television, a 24/7 reality show that runs continuously over his lifetime. The whole world watches his progress throughout this 'scripted' life, where Truman's every move becomes a fanatical obsession with viewers.Truman becomes suspicious of the ploy, and begins to be disillusioned, seeking ways to exit this created world that has boundaries...As a different movie it shines, but as an epic it falls short...it does, however, make you wonder about our link to television, and how it has taken over our lives...",8,0,1,15 October 2017

Life," The best parts in the movie...
","...were at the start, and the very last 5 minutes. In between, we have a mishmash of useless dialog, and rather poor acting. One reviewer said it true, 'Another movie with professionals acting stupidly...' Which turns out to be the highlight of the story...No, this one didn't make the grade, even though some of the actor's movements in zero G were good. Unfortunately, the rest of the action is predictable, to say the least. You can tell what the whole movie is about in the first 20 minutes, and plays out that way. The only surprise turns up right at the end, but I won't tell you that and spoil the whole viewing experience for you...By all means, see this movie...just don't expect a masterpiece...",4,4,8,22 October 2017
Apollo 13," It was actually underappreciated...
","Yes it was a dramatized movie, and yes some of the sequences were made up...but the movie was as accurate as could possibly be to make a movie. This happened, it was real, and I watched it live as it happened...Frankly it doesn't get better than Apollo 13, a moon flight that never made it...yet captured the hearts of an entire world...",10,0,0,19 June 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Every bit as grossly real as the battles it portrays...
","Some might say that the battle scenes are too gross...but there is, and never has been a nice clean battle...ever...That, I think, is the strikingly accurate tempo of the movie, even the non-battle parts. Desmond Doss went through a private hell when he enlisted in the Army, and faced initial ridicule for what has become to be recognized as a valid belief. But this movie also shows the personal heroism that resides within each veteran, whether they carry a weapon or not. In fact, Hacksaw Ridge brings to light the truth of non-violent heroics...The battle scenes are straight out of hell itself, and if you can't handle gruesome, perhaps you should avoid this film...for this one is indeed more gruesome than Saving Private Ryan. don't kid yourself, I find WW2 movies very entertaining, but even I had a tough time with some of it...",7,0,1,1 October 2017
Gladiator," A superbly crafted movie
","There just isn't much you can say that's bad about Gladiator. Ridley Scott did a fine job in this outing, recreating the majesty and barbarity of ancient Rome. Russell Crowe captures the intense loyalty and inner turmoil that must have permeated every Roman soldier of stature during the heyday of the civilization. And certainly all of the supporting cast were 'in the mood' during the filming. While it is not a semi-documentary story, it never the less grabs you with the somber way the love story progresses. Yes, it is a love story too, not just between two people but of an entire empire as well. I find myself drawn to this movie every time I see it is playing on TV...excellent couple hours of that good old entertainment!",10,1,2,26 January 2014
Contact," I guess I'm still not cerebral enough...
","...because I found much of the movie to be dry, bland and frankly not terribly exciting at all...I did like one particular part at the end, when the Senator talks to the skeptic scientist, after Jodi has been raked over the coals, and dismissed as a goofball...She mentions to him that she found it strange that, for an event that apparently took only 30 seconds, the onboard recorder recorded 18 hours of static, heh heh...a nice touch...",7,0,1,10 October 2018
Jurassic Park," What can you say about one of the most brilliant films ever.
","When I sat down in the theater seat I had no idea what to expect. I hadn't seen a big screen movie in a long time, but I'm glad I saw this one the first time there. I'd have to say Jurassic Park was brilliantly executed from start to finish, with absolutely outstanding CGI blended in with some very stunning acting. I'm kind of a science follower anyway, so when they incorporated some sound scientific elements into the story, it sort of added to an almost perfect story. Don't believe you could 'genetically engineer some dinosaurs??? While there are two conflicted camps in the Genetics realm, there is generally agreement that it is possible. It would simply be very difficult to create the right genetic conditions, then you wouldn't quite know what you had until the animal hatched. So yes, the apparent ease of manipulation you see in Jurassic Park is a bit over the top, which is one of the reasons I only gave it a 9. The other reason is that about half the dinosaurs depicted in the movie were from totally different time periods. The Brachiosaurus is about the only truly large dinosaur that was firmly entrenched in the Jurassic period. There were a couple other plant eaters that were really huge also, but no large carnivores. The majority in the movie belonged in the Cretaceuos period.Oh well, it was and still is the leader in movies that bring dinosaurs to life!",9,2,3,24 October 2015
Alien: Covenant," I should have read the reviews before renting...
","I had the bright idea to rent this on Amazon Prime. After watching for twenty minutes, I thought the movie hadn't started yet, so I came here to read the reviews...and found that I had made a BIIIGG mistake renting it...The first 5 minutes is some inexplicable footage, with a man 'testing' an android in a huge blank room with a window, a chair, a piano, and a statue. Totally bland and boring as can be...Suddenly we have the starship Covenant traveling through space, deploying a solar sail array for no apparent reason. We are supposed to read the horribly small print to understand that it is a colony ship, on its way to a planet, with 7 some odd years to go on the trip, with our resident android the only one moving around, tending 2000 frozen colonists and 1500 frozen embryo's...Mysterious space storm pops up, AI calls the 'Doctor' android to the bridge, space storm trashes the solar sail, throws the starship around in a series of suspicious gyrations that knock the cryo pods off their hangers onto the deck (Yes folks, these pods were 'hanging' up like clothes on the line)...you get the picture yet ??? Suddenly, because of the storm, a bunch of the people are given emergency wake up calls, fall out of their pods...except for one, whose pod turns bright shades of red light, and then cremates the guy inside with flames...YES, I said flames...that is one heck of a cryo-freeze failure.AND WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHO ANYONE IS !!! And that is only the first 40 minutes...Before Prometheus I thought Alien Resurrection was the worst, but then Prometheus took the lead on that...now Covenant take the prize as the absolute worst of the franchise...There is no lead up to the story, no character building at all. A full hour into Covenant, you still have no clue who anybody is...One reviewer did say it best. Another Ridley Scott film, of supposed professionals, running around doing stupid things...The plot, if there is one at all, is completely disjointed, and there is a lot of useless action throughout the movie that does absolutely nothing to help you understand what is going on. The acting is horrendously abysmal, to say the least, with no one clearly in charge. People start dying for the dumbest of reasons, or are infected with the xenomorph through an alien 'spore' that gets breathed up through their noses. Heck, these idiot characters even go out exploring an unknown alien planet in, what looks like, Russian Revolution hand me down regular clothes, with no real protection at all...To give you an idea how bad this Covenant is, I felt less angry wasting 20 bucks on 'buying' Prometheus, than I do about totally wasting 5.99 to rent this loser of a movie...Alien Covenant is truly that bad...",2,2,4,2 September 2017
The Martian," This was well thought out and frankly well done...
","To be honest, I am not sure where some of the negative reviews came from...but I have to wonder what kinds of movies they consider good...The Martian was simply put together very well, having a realistic plot, and a totally believable story...the scientific accuracy is the best I've ever seen in a scifi movie, and you can relate to what Mark Watney has to go through to survive. There might be a couple scientific inaccuracies, but you'd have to look very closely to pick them out...Yes, ok. The space ship was rather over the top design wise, and the actual rescue stretches credibility a bit...but overrall it is an excellent movie to watch...",9,0,1,10 June 2018
