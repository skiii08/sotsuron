The Blair Witch Project," The Myrick/Sanchez Hype Project.
","Yawn. I don't know - although everyone I know loves and worships this film, I was completely unmoved. It consists, for the most part, of two whiny guys and a snotty girl shouting obscenities. It makes me wish I had videotaped my own failed camping trip - perhaps I could've made $100 million off of it too. Definitely a film more interesting to talk about than to actually see (although its only real interest is as a marketing concept.)",Null,0,0,8 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Another argument to ban CGI
","It was quite clear that Lucas & Co. were so in love with the idea of CGI that they failed to notice that the original Star Wars characters have far more dimension than these flat (both in appearance and quality) characters ever did. The effects in the old movies were actually more convincing and interesting. The only characters that were at all likeable were - surprise - R2D2 and C3PO. (Thank the Lord they didn't CGIfy R2D2! And don't get me started on that awful Jar Jar creature.) As for the writing, the story was apparently none of our business. I would like my $6 back.",1,0,1,5 June 1999
Fight Club," Sorry, I don't buy it. (spoiler, maybe)
","This movie makes the occasional gesture towards Nietszche and being a fight between Reason and the Id - this becomes most apparent closer to the end, when we learn a little something about our main characters. Mostly, however, it is about grown men beating each other into gumbo, because the actual meat of the movie barely touches on that. Essentially, it is a little bit of philosophy wrapped up in a lot of very, very bloody boxing. There's something suspect about the whole matter.It's a rush, sure, but if they wanted to film a WCW match, why did they feel the need to wrap some half-baked quasi-New Age ideas around it? I fear that a bunch of guys around the country will miss the spirit-vs-flesh angle and decide that this fighting thing is Way Cool, Man, and will set up little Fight Clubs in their basements until they all die from internal hemorrhaging. I guess people will buy anything if you wrap fake spirituality around it.",2,4,11,31 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," I laughed, much to the chagrin of my guilty Catholic conscience
","Well, I like the TV series, but this movie .... aaggghhhh! I thought it was impossible to offend me, but _man_, is this movie nasty ... Not that it wasn't funny - I laughed my little gluteus maximus off, but the whole time I was thinking, 'Oh my God! I can't believe I'm laughing at this!' If you're a more hardened soul than I, you'll probably love it. 'Saddam is from Mars, Satan is from Venus?' Heh heh heh ...",3,0,7,26 September 1999
Sleepy Hollow," I was thoroughly unimpressed. (slight spoiler, maybe?)
","Well, actually, it isn't all Tim Burton's fault. The script was dreadful. For starters, it abandons the actual Sleepy Hollow myth - and we're not talking about a few artistic liberties here; it's a completely different, and somewhat inferior, story. The script is weak, confused, and can't even follow its own internal logic (I can't give you an obvious example, unfortunately - it's a spoiler), and one character (let's not say who) comes down with an unfortunate case of James Bond Villain Syndrome. If you see it - although I suggest you don't - you'll see what I mean.Tim Burton seems to have been so in love with the image of the gloomy forest and galloping horseman that he forgot about the rest of the movie. Get a decent script next time, Tim.",3,2,5,27 November 1999
Romeo + Juliet," Oh, come on ... it wasn't completely worthless.
","Modern adaptations of Shakespeare are all the rage, of course, and they're always a big gamble - in the attempt to communicate the 'timelessness' of Shakespeare's plays, one can wind up with something all the more dated and forgettable. This is probably along those lines, but it's not without charm.I seem to be one of the few not disturbed by the present-day setting. If there was one thing this movie actually did very well, it was to effectively grasp, perhaps by accident, the emotional motif of Romeo & Juliet and place it in the present day. The decadence and schlocky absurdity of all the scenery is actually quite consistent with the feel of the play.Personally, I'm not sure what to make of it. Perhaps Baz Luhrmann realized that most of the actors under 30 didn't know what they were doing, and decided to distract from it with his camerawork. If you want to see Romeo & Juliet, this is most certainly not the version to see - the acting is generally horrid and the script takes some highly questionable, er, 'liberties'. But it's still an interesting little effort somehow.",Null,0,1,30 September 1999
American Beauty," Good Lord, what a fantastic movie
","I'm speechless ... but let me try. Just saw a preview screening at my school, and it was perhaps one of the best things to come out of Hollywood in years and years. This movie is almost unquestionably Oscar-bound - one of the few movies I've seen that treated the American middle class experience with some degree of truth. Kevin Spacey is fantastic, and there was a VERY shocking moment in the film which I will not give away, and can't even think of an appropriate way to hint at ... Just see the film!",Null,0,0,21 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," Malkovich Malkovich? Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich.
","This movie is probably the closest Hollywood will come to avant-garde filmmaking. It's a fascinating, Kafkaesque little tale (as I imagine every review is probably describing it) about celebrity, personal identity, puppets, and the New Jersey Turnpike. Performances are great all-around - John Cusack as a misunderstood puppeteer, John Malkovich as both himself and John Cusack, Cameron Diaz as a woman less attractive than Cameron Diaz ... definitely worth seeing.",10,0,1,7 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Not worthless but still quite overrated
","The film means well, and for the first half hour is indeed riveting, but is done in due to Spielberg's clumsiness. In time, the battle scenes begin to simply play out like a video game. And why the triumphant music when Jeremy Davies kills the German soldier? Is Spielberg trying to declare all Germans to be pond scum and deserving of death? Probably not, but it's poorly directed and ambiguous. And regardless of the absurdly jingoistic sentiments of some of my fellow countrymen here (which are not worth responding to), the US flag at the end was tacky and implied American superiority. Even my great-uncle, a proud WWII veteran, agreed that this was unnecessary. Spielberg may have meant to shown the true hell that war is, but he has inadvertently made a pro-war film. American entry in WWII was inevitable and necessary, but it's nothing to celebrate.",6,0,1,15 February 1999
The Graduate," Ah, a movie for young people to love and old people to be embarrassed they loved
","I have heard critics speak of how much they loved this film when they first saw it as a young whippersnapper, and now look at it and say 'What were we thinking?'Well, as a young whippersnapper, I must admit I love it. I think the people who criticize it for projecting shallow people don't understand that this is the point. How does one explain the ending, where the camera sits on the allegedly happy, triumphant couple for just a tad too long, forcing us to reconsider this 'happy' ending?I think these critics are embarrassed by this movie because they missed its basic theme the first time around, which is that Ben and Elaine are Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, and the viewers of 'The Graduate' are not immune from the same fate. Overall, a tremendously insightful movie, even more so than it gets credit for.",Null,0,1,15 December 1999
