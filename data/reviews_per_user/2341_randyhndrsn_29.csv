Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I did not like the 1st one, and this one was even worse.
","I am not a fan of the kill bill movies, but i could handle the first one and say it was cool.But Kill Bill Vol. 2 was pretty bad, it had some very stupid scenes that just blew me away with how stupid they were.And the end of the movie was terrible, you think there will be a big fight between her and bill, it last about 20 seconds.And scenes with uma and her daughter were really bad, out scenes of her training were even worse.I can respect cool movies being made like a clockwork orange, but kill bill just can not do it.A very highly overrated film that i hope people Will someday see how bad it is.I guess people just can not see where great plot comes in to a movie.",6,1,4,20 January 2006
Love and Death," This movie is great.
","This is one of Woody Allen's funniest movies, it made me laugh the entire time and i just loved it.This is back when Woody Allen did more stupid type movie, instead of the drama ones that a lot of us know.But his movies like this are just great to watch, his comic genius really shows in this movie.I think just about anyone can laugh at this movie and enjoy it, his films blow me away and love and death is one of my favorites.Woody Allen is a true genius and his movies are nothing but pure genius, i love this movie so much and always like to watch it when i need a laugh.This movie is also very cool, it has some of the coolest stuff i have seen in a comedy and that helps the movie become nothing less of a classic.",10,2,2,21 January 2006
Howl's Moving Castle," I was so happy when i saw it.
","I am a huge fan of his films, and when i first saw that this was coming out i wanted to see it so bad.And today i actually got to see it at the theater, and was so excited about seeing a good anime at the theater.The movie is great but what made it great was the theater experience, i really enjoyed the movie though.I put it in one of the better anime's films i have seen in a long time, the movie could of had more action but it did a great job with a good old story.It being sweet and a well done was nice, i loved the parts that had action and had things happen with a lot of magic.The animation was awesome, sometimes i thought it was real and then i saw the characters and remembered it was anime.This is worth seeing and probably Worth owning, i will never forget seeing it at the theater and the movie will always be with me.",9,2,3,27 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I liked it.
","I am getting tired of people saying bad things about phantom menace, i love this star wars and think it is great.It has amazing special effects and great acting, with very cool special effect scenes like the race or the final light saber fight.When i saw this at the theater, i was not disappointed at all, i am surprised to how many people talk bad about this star wars.It has everything that you could want in a star wars movie and is so good, i love watching this movie and think it was very well done.I am glad that it did well at the theater so George Lucas would make the other 2, i like the new star wars and think they are underrated.There a lot like the old star wars movies, just with a lot better special effects and better light saber fights.The old ones are classics, but i have nothing bad to say about the new star wars.",7,1,2,16 January 2006
I'm Not There," This movie is good but in a weird way.
","I recently watched I'm not there and this movie isn't done in a way that really makes sense sometimes or flows, but after the first 10 minutes you really understand what is happening.This movie has differen't stories from differen't characters that come in and differen't times, and they all have something to do with bob Dylan's life.I thought the movie was gonna show one story at a time, but they show one for like 5 minutes then another one and comeback to it later and sometimes only show a clip for it for a few seconds.This is done in a very art-house style and is for fans of the genre, it isn't abstract crap like some movies but actually has some great scenes that are visually wonderful.Some scenes play like Fellini's 81/2 and this movie feels like a foreign film a lot of the time but the characters speak English.This movie is far from perfect for my taste and I am not a huge Dylan fan but I respect him a lot, the movie pretty much does a good job at pulling you into it and you go for a ride.It's well made and the acting is good all around, don't watch the movie if you don't like art type films or movies that focus on characters and out of place scenes that are put there for a visual purpose.It's a cool flick and I think a lot of people can respect it, it's nice to see something original and not in some movie formula like a lot of Hollywood blockbusters we get these days.",8,77,115,3 January 2008
Star Trek," A reboot done right?
","The new star trek was a major surprise, with fantastic pacing, acting and special effects, this turned out to be the first real blockbuster of 09.In a mediocre summer that 09 was, this film stood out by being inspired and never too stupid or too clever, the basic tone is something like a star wars film.That was the way to go, the story focuses on the origins of the star trek characters from the original series, and the cast is fantastic with Chris Pine being my favorite.Not always perfect, but it actually does get better with multiple viewings and you can look over the plot flaws in the film, you end up loving the flaws.I promise if you ride along with this baby than you will have one great time, worth even owning and watching a lot, I am excited for this cast and crew to take me into a new franchise.",8,5,9,23 November 2009
Fight Club," What a cool movie.
","Fight club is awesome, and it is one of the coolest movies i have ever seen in my life and the reasons are.Awesome acting, cool scenes, wonderful twists, the narration is great and the effects are nice to.I did not know the movie was gonna be the way it was, it had so much to it and was just such a cool movie that i watched it 2 times in 2 days and i wanna watch it again.This is my kinda movie, the only reason i do not give it a 10 is because it was not perfect, it needed more story then it had.And even though i like long movies, i think they did not have enough in this movie to make it as long as it was but it starts out great.The end is one of the best ends to a movie that i have ever seen, brad Pitt's part is well known but i preferred Edward Norton's acting in this movie.I have a certain taste of movies, and this movie was exactly what i want to see and is close to a perfect 10, but i just could not say it was perfect.I say this movie is worth buying, and most definitely worth watching more then once, so i say check out fight club.",10,0,2,17 March 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Pretty bad and the director sucks.
","This 4th film in the X-Men franchise should of been pretty good, the mistakes with the 3rd film are understandable considering the change of directors and writers.But the studio had a chance to take a fresh stab at it with a new crew for Wolverine's movie, the problem is that fox got a bad director and writers on this movie and the final product is nothing less of awful.The film has a cast that isn't really great but none of the actors are bad actors, Hugh Jackman has been fine as the main character before and the supporting players are all decent enough actors for a summer blockbuster but the problem isn't really the acting.But the writing of the characters and what the actors have to do with them, the cheesy moments and bad dialog that they have to say must of been hard for the actors and there is few really good scenes in the movie.The movie pretty much fails with it's opening and ending, the only decent thing about the film is Sabertooth and perhaps getting to see some other characters.But the really fault with this film isn't exactly the story itself or the producers, but I want to put the blame on director Gavin Hood who has pretty much no experience to make a high level blockbuster.It was a risk by the studio to hire him and sometimes that works, and it isn't like because he made this bad movie that he is going to make nothing but bad movies.David Fincher made alien 3, then went on to make nothing but good movies after that terrible film, perhaps Gavin just wasn't given enough to work with on Wolverine.The movie is poorly shot, edited and paced, the tone is wrong and it just isn't a very well made film from a technical or artistic standpoint but it also fails at being fun.A movie dosen't have to be well made to be enjoyable, it could have good special effects and action scenes to keep you enjoying the film and make it worth the time and money.Wolverine happens to be boring and terrible as a action film, every time something good is happening it ends up being pretty lame and the fights themselves are not very memorable or special.Remember the liberty island fights in x-men?Or the great night crawler whitehouse scene in x2?Nothing like that here, just a lot of cheap looking images and bad direction, save your money and time and just don't see this movie.Wolverine, I wish I could give you the claw middle finger.",5,27,71,22 April 2009
500 Days of Summer," Being dumped sucks.
","I suppose we have all wanted love or have been lonely many times In our lives, but the truth Is that we must play these up and downs games with life.I watched 500 days of summer after a pretty major breakup, and I can tell you that It helped, this movie makes us think about all the right and wrong things we do.Relationships aren't always meant to last, and perhaps some of us start to take things too seriously, but never have I seen a movie that captures a guy so well.Not a man or some Hollywood Image, but the lead Character Tom Is the person you know you are, the one who wants to die when his love goes against him again.Wonderful chemistry between the two leads and dialog push this movie to high levels, It may not be perfect because It tries a little to hard to be original.The editing and the pacing Is off, but you really don't care by the end because everything made so much sense, this Is a hard film to watch because It feels like life.Life can be a painful thing, but 500 days of summer helps you remember that It's beautiful sometimes and thinking straight always helps.",8,0,1,6 October 2009
Cloverfield," No it dosen't suck.
","I remember hearing about the trailer of the movie and everyone was asking questions, so I found out all I could and over time became another nerd wanting to to know.Well the movie is called cloverfield and I'd say it's a winner, a lot of the early reviews I read were mixed but I think the movie was very good at what it wanted to do.It was very intense for some scenes and visually nice, the story is simple yet very effective at times and a lot of stuff is a little hard to enjoy because it's just a bunch of stupid 20 something's talking.But once the monster attacks, it gets good and stays good for the rest of the movie and the I wasn't really disappointed or blown away.It is a theater experience and a event everyone should go see, I was in a packed theater and that made it even better and when the film ended I felt very satisfied and the movie stays with you.Just go see it and have a good time, this movie is a pretty good time and it isn't too long or boring and keeps your happy most of the runtime.",8,1,5,18 January 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Pretty funny and pretty cool.
","I think this is a very good movie that is very funny and very original, i am a Stanley Kubrick fan and i like how he did this.The black and white with it being like a war movie was good, but it being a comedy making fun of those movies was great.I loved how this movie was made and just enjoyed it so much, i like watching Dr. Strangelove after awhile and it is always entertaining.Before i saw it, i had a lot of ideas what it would be like, i was surprised to how the movie actually was all comedy.I was so glad that Stanley Kubrick made a very funny movie that is very good, it is not my favorite movie by Stanley Kubrick.But i do like this movie and hope to own it someday.",9,1,2,15 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Best Star Wars Movie.
","This is in my top 3 favorite movies, and i think it is the best star wars movie that George made.The movie is like the movies in one, it has a beginning then a middle part and a end part that comes together in one movie.I love how this movie is the first star wars to use a lot of lightsaber, and have the great scenes on the planets and a lot less space.George Lucas out did himself with return of the Jedi, and this movie even has my favorite lightsaber fight out of the entire series.This movie has been my favorite star wars since i was a kid, and i always think people underrate it as not being as good as the empire strikes back.This is the best scifi movie i have ever seen, and one of the best movies i have ever seen period, with all of the great things this movie is i say watch it.Star Wars is my favorite movies, and i think this one is the star wars to really watch and may the force be with you.",9,3,6,15 January 2006
Lost in Translation," I love the movie.
","This movie is very good and very well done, i love the writing of this movie and the acting is very good and it is a original movie in many ways.It is a movie that you can relax and watch, it has something about it and that something is like a very cool movie with just these slow and nice scenes.The thing i most liked about this movie was the shots of japan, there was some great camera work done that helped this movie out a lot for me.Scarlett Johansson does a great job and she is one of my favorite new actors, she is great looking and has so much potential to be a Oscar winner.Bill Murray is one of my favorite comic actors, and how he acts in his new movie like this is very good, he has this very upset 40's man character going on.I think this movie is very good and i do not give it a 10 because it is not perfect, but i wish i could of saw it at the theater and i always enjoy watching it.",9,3,7,20 January 2006
Léon: The Professional," A very romantic and violent film.
","This film has a great sorta love story between a young girl and a man in his 40's, jean reno is a great actor and really find the exact perfect role in Leon.Natalie portman is as good as kid actors can get in this movie, and the film is directed very well with some nice shots and angles.The story isn't too complicated but a cool one, and the movie has some big action scenes that I think really standout as far as action films go.The professional is a film about someone who never has known much about love or feelings for someone else, and someone who knows how to give love but dosen't get it from others and deserves it so much.I really love the french style look of this film, it isn't perfect sometimes but it is mostly a fine film and a lot of people love it, for the style of the film and the real charm it has in some scenes.",9,2,4,31 January 2008
Jarhead," I liked it a lot.
","This movie was better then i thought it was gonna be, i loved the shots and some of the scenes were just well done and had very good acting.I think this movie deserved a couple Oscar nominations, but it seemed like the academy does not agree with me.I wanted to see jar head for awhile, and i finally got it on DVD, me and my friend were watching it and laughing for awhile because of this movies comedy.But it has a lot of serious parts, at least it gets serious they more you get into the film and time goes kinda slow.But it did not seem long, it was my kinda movie that i enjoy watching, i kinda knew id like it before i even started the DVD.I would buy jar head because i think i could watch this a lot more times, it is worth renting and i think you should go out and get it when you can.Jake did a good job like he usually does, and the movie satisfied me and that is all a movie should really do for you. so jar head was not a great movie, but it was a pretty good movie that i am glad they made for me to watch.This movie kinda reminded me of full metal jacket, but it wasn't as good and you can probably find better war movies.I don't care, i liked jar head a lot and that is i really need to appreciate a film.",8,0,1,13 March 2006
Spirited Away," One of the best anime's i have ever seen.
","This movie is wonderful, and it really made me respect Hayao Miyazaki as a person and as a director.I love his movies, but i think this is his best work for the reason that this is a spectacular anime, that i love to watch.I always try to figure out what his best movie is or what my favorite Hayao Miyazaki movie is, but i am gonna say spirited away is his best work and really blew me away.It has great animation and it is one of the most original anime films out there, so i think he just showed how good he is with this movie.If you are a anime fan, then i think you should like this movie a lot and once you see one of Hayao Miyazaki's movies.It is like you have to see them all, this is a excellent anime that is done perfect.",10,4,9,16 January 2006
City of God," This movie rocks
","City of god is one of the best movies ever, it is so awesome with great violence a very awesome style and very good writing.aia just finished watching it, and it was so cool.It is a movie that you can not get off your mind because of how great it was, it just absolutely rocks so much.I think most people period will love this movie, it is got the violence, the story and great characters.It is a all around classic in my mind and blew me away, i am not a fan of subtitled movies.But i had no trouble reading the subtitles in this movie, i think this movie will only be good subtitled.Not if you can understand it, the reading helped make the movie's style even better to perfection.Just plain cool and very well done, city of god rocks.",10,1,4,27 January 2006
Across the Universe," I don't know how someone couldn't like it.
","I saw the trailer to this film and got really excited but then the film got mixed reviews and I was worried, but this movie is one of the best of 07 and one of the best musicals I have ever seen.If you love the Beatles or the 60's this movie is for you, the story is actually good and the acting is also much better then one would think from such unknown actors but they all do good.I went with 2 other people and one was my father who grew up in that time and the movie made him remember some stuff, and the music works because the Beatles represent that time and period of the world.This film looks good and sounds good, I hate when the Beatles are sung by other people but somehow this film didn't bother me.I also was surprised how I got into the love story of the film, don't let anyone tell you it was disappointing or bad because you need to make that choice yourself.Also do not wait for the DVD, this is a theater experience and if you see it on a DVD you will miss the joy of seeing this on the big screen.Go see this movie, tell others to see it and make sure to just set back and get into everything that is going on and you will have a great time.",8,0,2,30 October 2007
Dog Day Afternoon," One of the best movies I have ever seen.
","This movie is absolutely great, the beginning was terrific and it just stayed good through the entire 2 hours of the movie.And id like to say that Al Pacino's Performance, was one of the best acting jobs that i have ever seen in a movie.He put passion into the character, and made you fell sympathy for him even though he was robbing a bank.The directing was fantastic, and how Sidney Lumet did the filming in a actual new york building made it like you were actually there.Excellent true story that was adapted to this movie, and when I think of suspense or bank robbery movies.I think of dog day afternoon, anyone who does not like this movie just does not know what there talking about.One of my favorite movies, and I will never forget the acting Pacino did in dog day afternoon.",10,3,4,6 April 2006
Amadeus," If you heard it's great, Then that is true,
","I watched Amadeus last night and it blew me away, it was 160 minutes of pure excellent acting and just such a fun movie.I was not sure if I was gonna like it, but i loved every second of Amadeus.The movie had a job done by both main actors, and the music was just a pure excellent pleasure.Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a great composer, and this movie shows his talents very well even though his character is not very smart.You can see the drive for music in his life, and the final scenes of the movie where they are writing the end to Wolfgang's song of death was just amazing.And the lines said about the voice of god, and the parties and operas were just pure brilliant and pure fun.What a awesome movie to watch, I can not believe some people find this boring or stupid.A great Motion Picture, that is exactly what this movie is and all it will ever be.",10,1,2,25 June 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I like the director, but i do not like this movie.
","This movie is very highly overrated, i am a fan of all of Quentin's work, but this movie is really bad.It has no plot really, besides she wants to kill bill and the acting is kinda terrible.It is like they got a lot of good actors, and told them not to act good for the movie and just act stupid.It is a cool movie, but besides the action scenes and the style of the movie, there is not much to like about it.Films like pulp fiction were based more on good acting and well written scenes with violence when it was needed.This movie just is missing that, i was very surprised that i did not like this movie and i think it is only worth watching on TV.I was very shocked from Quentin here.",7,1,3,20 January 2006
Annie Hall," Woody Allen is a genius.
","Woody Allen is one of the greatest film maker's of all time, his movies are written perfect and he does comedy perfect.This is not my favorite Woody Allen movie, but i do like it a lot and i love how he does this movie.It is drama with comedy, and scenes in new york and the same music in all his movies, Woody Allen dosen't like to change.But i think he has something perfect, i wouldn't change it either and one thing good about Annie hall is woody.Him acting the way he does and talking to the camera is perfect, this man makes the movie with Dian Keaton doing a great job as well.Her roles in a lot of his movies are always excellent, this was Woody Allen's first big Oscar winning movie and is still considered his best work.If you like Woody Allen, then this film is just for you and i think it is a good couple movie that you can watch with a wife and girlfriend.The great Woody does it again with Annie Hall.",10,29,60,21 January 2006
The Graduate," I think this movie is awesome.
","The graduate is a great movie that has some of the best things that a movie can have, and is one of my favorites.It has great music, acting, scenes and even good writing that makes this one of the coolest movies out there.Cool is the perfect word for this movie, it is a classic movie that i have watched a lot of times, with everything in it being some of my favorite stuff to watch.I really enjoy the graduate and i think any movie lover will love this film, and it is one of the best movies from the 60's and one of those good movies that you don't see being made anymore.I have a very high opinion of the graduate and think it is Dustin Hoffman's best movie.",10,0,0,16 January 2006
Titanic," The great love story.
","I have only a few things to say about titanic, and that is i think it is nothing but a event in films.The film in my mind, is one of the greatest love stories and movies of all time.I am shocked that it is not in IMDb's top 250.The movie has great direction and a great story with some very nice and well done special effects.It is also one of the biggest money making movies of all time and deserves more credit.It won so many awards and was loved by the critics in a great way/The movie starts with a team searching for a safe on the titanic and when they find it.They discover pictures, with one of a naked woman that they ask for information on.A old woman named rose, comes forward and tells her story of how she lost her love.And how she basically fell in love with theis man.The story is great and has a lot of fiction and non-fiction at the same time.Eventually the ship has a accident and starts to sink, then it becomes a survival for thousands of people who mostly die.The movie has very famous scenes and out of them all.The scene where rose and jack are holding hands and he sais never to let go.This scene has become a very famous scene and has been made fun of as well.But it even has a great song that is played a lot in the movie.And i am proud to of watched such a great film and i hope it get's in the top 250 someday.Titanic is a film that is in a whole level of it's own, and it is a one kind film for are times.",9,1,2,29 September 2005
Vanilla Sky," I really like it.
","Vanilla Sky is a very odd but very cool movie, i like everything about it and i love the great special effects that it has in some parts.The film is a awesome idea, but they director and writers just seem to screw it up.It had so much potential to be great, but they made it have a lot of scenes that were not needed at all.I like a lot of things about the style of the film, i am all about colors of things and images that we see in a movie.Vanilla Sky does a good job with those thing that are kinda retro and original, i liked this movie and had been looking forward to watching it for awhile.The Mexican version of this film, that this movie is a remake of does a great job, and i wish they could of done it more like that.They made this movie too long for what it had to offer us, now i still like vanilla sky a lot and what it has is very good.You have to like a certain kind of film to like this.",8,0,0,21 January 2006
Casino Royale," Bond is serious, and it is a good thing to see.
","I really liked casino royale, the one thing that really was good about it was how James bond came off like a real spy or assassin.Instead of just some ladies man with a gun, I am a huge fan of the 007 series but this one had something about it.The action was just good, and Craig makes a very good bond for the new generation who doesn't wanna see the movie bond.The only thing that kinda needed some work, was the story that I found a little weak at some points and while watching the movie I thought about this.But after it was over, I thought about the whole movie and everything I had just seen, then I came to the conclusion of it being a very solid movie.Even some minor weak points couldn't destroy that, this film had style and it was just a pretty cool movie to watch.I'd advise people to see it in the theater, and I even think it is worth owning because I feel it is like a movie that gets even better with multiple viewings.All in all, casino royale had a great new style for a bond movie to be made and this makes me really wanting a sequel with Daniel Craig as bond again.",9,2,4,29 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This is as good as it gets,.
","Star Wars is a awesome movie, it just shows you how amazing films can be and how they can change the world and film history forever.I love this movie for many reasons, but one is because this movie is just a classic and one of the best movies i have ever seen.I am so glad this movie has done so well over the years and become so loved across the world, it really deserves all of it's praise and all of it's fans.I really respect George Lucas more then any other director that i know, and think he is the best guy at making a great movie.This film started all 6 of the great movies, and no matter all the times i watch it, it never seems to get old.I say this is in the top ten best films of all time, and i think it is as good as a movie can get, i will always be a star wars fan and i will always love this movie.",10,1,2,15 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," I love this one!
","This is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best movies that has ever been made.Star Wars was a great movie, and a sequel being better then it seemed impossible, but empire strikes back is a better movie with a lot of good stuff.The special effects are still good today and the story is pretty good, i love a lot things that this movie has that star wars didn't.Like a lot better fight scenes, and they show a lot more of places and planets then the 1st one.I was very pleased with this movie and think it is a great film for a true movie fan to watch, i disagree with a lot of people who say it is the best star wars movie.But i can understand why they say it, empire has a lot of things to it that are just well done and impressive.I think this movie is worth owning and is a movie you can watch many times.",10,4,7,15 January 2006
Princess Mononoke," Great anime.
","This is a great anime and the first movie i ever saw from Hayao Miyazaki, i loved this movie and did not know he made it until later.After this movie i watched a lot of his movies like spirited away and castle in the sky, his films are some of the best anime movies out there and this one is one of his best.It is very original, but i love thus movie for it's great fight scenes and wonderful creatures and characters.The story is wonderful and the animation is just about perfect, with great voice overs that i just loved.This is a rare anime that i think any anime fan shouldn't miss out on, with many great things this anime is a classic.",10,5,9,16 January 2006
