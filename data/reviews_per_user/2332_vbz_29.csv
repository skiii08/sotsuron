The Blair Witch Project," Groundbreaking Film mortally hurt by excessive hype
","A spit in every major Hollywood studio's face, to say the least, and the second film this summer to learn a lesson from MTV's atrocious programming and put it to superior, even revolutionary use. With 'Run Lola Run' it was the relentless pace and non-dependence on dialogue which created a sublime effect, a near return to the silent era. 'Blair Witch' took the channel's utterly false reality of home-video footage and documentary-style acting, transforming it into perhaps the most realistic falseness to ever grace the silver screen. The enormous buzz that surrounds this amazing horror movie (which never aspires to be more than a cheeky genre entry) has already started an undeserved yet equally strong backlash, mostly by jealous film-students at first, then by the spoiled masses which could not comprehend anything beyond Will Smith's special effects-ridden vehicles. Misunderstood both by the critics who hailed it as the next cineamtic movement and the audiences bombasted by the hype, 'Blair Witch' should be taken at face value; although currently that is practically impossible to do. The degree of scariness in the exploits of three young idiots (types all too familliar to everyone who attended college) doomed to perish in the haunted Maryland woods will largely correspond to one's own level of sensitivity, but regardless of how frightened the film makes you, it amounts to an experience of gleeful delight,(akin to the great 'Evil Dead' series minus the cartoonish gore), of taking part in something new and refreshing. Of course the overall execution is not totally original, deriving mainly from 'The Real World' and an obscure 80's Vietnam flick called '84 Charlie Mopic', but what does it matter? Nothing, repeat NOTHING spurts out of the blue - (a classic case in point would be Tarantino inspired by Goddard and Melville inspired by Carol Reed and John Huston inspired by the 20's expressionist cinema and 'Public Enemy'). 'Blair Witch', while not transcending its genre, still has a share of pure visual artistry, some probably unintentional. A certain beauty lies in the shots of Heather Donahue's white shape jetting through the dark forest, the ominous rays of sun glittering in the evening trees. The amateur feel the directors generate is but an expertly-crafted illusion and therein lies the film's ultimate pleasure.",10,1,2,28 December 1999
Vertigo," Prime Hitchcock
","As mesmerizing as it is long and difficult to comprehend, 'Vertigo' is one of cinema's strangest tales of romantic obsession, the kind that certainly would not be made nowadays, since the subject is increasingly demonized in the American culture. Surprisingly enough, it works, in large part through the director's mastery over the medium. Some speculate that it was a highly personal project for him, a casting out of his own internal struggles. Such theories validity is questionable, but anyone watching will notice the movie's much lesser degree of calculating, joyful logic that almost all other Hitchcock's works are saturated with. Incredibly true to its title, by virtue of an eerie score and some dizzying cinematography, the movie induces the sense of romantic vertigo in the audience. A fantastic opening credits sequence which resembles digital animation, suggests a visionary quality that refused to be confined to its time period.",10,2,3,20 April 1999
Come and See," Apocalypse Then
","In all fairness, this Belorussian-made World War II picture detailing Nazi atrocities, holds a special distinction in world cinema: it is by far the most brutal and emotionally draining of all - in fact, a viewer whose senses have not been properly trained would most likely find it unwatchable. Those brave souls willing to be put through an ordeal of almost 2 1/2 hours will find themselves deeply immersed in an absolutely horrifying experience that will not easily subside whether they want it to or not.The title, 'Come and See', taken from the frequently repeating lines of the book of Revelation, clearly dares the audience to assume the role of St. John, witnessing the Apocalypse, or rather one of the darkest periods in the history of humankind. What we are assaulted with, plays somewhat like a demented version of 'Modern Times' transpiring across the panel of Brueghel's 'Trimuph of Death', if such a combination is possible. The camera is consistently filtered through a murky, slightly unfocused gaze, and the sound is often heard through shellshocked ears. This tends to eirly distance the events, yet make them even more frightening and unsettling. Much of the dialogue lacks specific meaning or even concrete sentences - it is replaced by subhuman growling, wailing and other spine-chilling, gluttural sounds of the war. What the director prepares is something Spielberg would never even dream of - no sign of compromise with the audience. A crowd of civilian villagers locked up in a barn by Nazi soldiers is not spared at the last minute like 'Schindler List's' Jews- they are burned alive, and we get to watch all of it.Unlike most of the films in this genre, 'Come and see' relies mainly on images and sounds instead of a coherent plot, which is not necesserily a weakness, since the sheer terror distorts time and space into a kind of hallucinatory blur, clearly intentional and understandable. But this incredible level of bleak intensity in the long run, has a negative effect on the film: the viewers have to desensitize themselves just so they can keep watching, so the most harrowing scenes are sat through in numbness.Another questionable move on the director's part is his occasional use of surrealism. While some visuals are painfully believable, while others are simply baffling: crazed villages consructing an effigy of Hitler, a pensive German commander with a pet slender loris (a rare African primate) on his shoulder, a female Nazi eating raw red lobster, not even mentioning a bizzare final montage wich is both inexplicable and obvious, ending with a real-life photograph that is perhaps the most terrifying of all in its implications. Yes, at times the movie overachieves its goals and seems almost like the footage in 'The Clockwork Orange' that they made Alex watch to cure him of 'ultraviolent' behaviour; yet other times it delivers the kind of jolts those accustomed to mainstream cinema could only wish they had. The face of a youth who had lost all sanity and aged many decades over several days, will be etched for an indefinite amount of time into the memory of anyone who has seen this film.",9,148,180,5 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," To Lucas: 'If money is all that you love, than that's what you'll receive'
","Well, Ladies and Gentlemen, the verdict is out. The film that will undoubtedly outgross 'Titanic' in its opening weekend alone is  obviously not up to par with the now-sacred trilogy. It does not even try to match the original's level of greatness. As a matter of fact, the new Star Wars does not even constitute a work of cinema: it's not really a movie. Most of the time, it resembles a historical reenactment of Vader/Anakin's early years , complete with detailed ethnographic and technological insights into the Galaxy that Lucas built; a kind of dramatization one would see on the Discovery Channel, or better yet, 'America's Most Wanted', only with a 150 million dollar budget. Everything that could give the 'The Phantom Menace' any artistic merit, i.e. character development, evocation of suspense or any other emotion, and a dynamic plot, are utterly lacking.For true fans, however, such a thorough examination of their beloved space locales would not be a disappointment. Hordes of creatures, machines and buildings are fascinating to behold, a testament to the collective imagination of Lucasfilm's crew. But give any teenager with an imaginary universe the proper resources and you'll see the exact same results. They will be happy to document their world on camera, but in a form of a chronological, documentary-like fashion, rather than a true work of fiction with exciting personalities and an engaging story. The later requires a different kind of talent, that of a writer, like Tolkien, for example, not a mere dreamer. Perhaps, Lucas should have consulted one instead of taking on the job himself.Only the middle section of the film, set on the familiar Tatooine, can generate some form of excitement, with a magnificently staged pod-race, albeit stolen from 'Ben Hur'. The wooden acting of most non-digital characters seems to have been also adopted from that sleep-inducing 1959 epic. The most fully-developed creature, ironically, is young Anakin's winged blue owner, who resists Jedi mind tricks and displays basic feelings that others do not. Jar-Jar, a sidekick designed for   laughs is no Chewie, and largely detracts from the action with his irritating behavior and an inexplicable Caribbean accent. The Humans, meanwhile, appear to be going through the motions, some like Samuel L. Jackson, barely get to even open their mouth. Darth Maul, a potentially excellent villain, overflowing with malice as he slices and dices everything in sight with his double-light-saber is the movie's single biggest letdown. He almost never speaks and reveals absolutely nothing about himself, not even juicy one-liners that Vader was so fond of.Those who know and cherish the Star Wars mythology will revel in the stunning visuals, while those who do not will likely feel confused and alienated by this highly impersonal production which is in many ways typical of the decade's blockbuster overkill. Perhaps it is only for the better, that the prequel does not violate the sanctity of episodes IV, V, and VI. It simply offers an explanation of previous events without much pretense. George Lucas is fully aware that he cannot outshine the works without which this project would not be possible. In any event, by the century's end, he has proven to operate by the principle that once moved Han Solo. As Leia has pointed out to that lovable scoundrel, 'if money is all that you love, than that's what you'll receive'.",2,0,1,20 May 1999
Casablanca," A most enduring classic
","The only pre-MPAA rating system movie that holds its popularity and cult status from the very time it was released (even 'Gone With the Wind' had a minor period of neglect), 'Casablanca' is most people's primary association when they hear the word 'classic'. And rightly so: all aspects of the production have no glitches whatsoever. Plotwise, the film recounts the aftermath of a romance undermined by a disaster (in this case, a devastating war): a theme forever exploited for its box-office potential. Here, the three-hankie quotient is relatively low due to an intelligent script which concentrates on Europe's reaction to a near-apocalyptic threat to its way of life and its freedom of spirit. We also have some unforgettable musical moments (and an answer for why the Beatles used 'La Marselliase' in 'All You Need Is Love'), the inspiration behind the Mos Eisley cantina in 'Star Wars', the only representation of a black character up to that time that wasn't somehow demeaning, references which are widely speculated to be bisexual, and so much more! Some characters, one has to admit, are better developed than others (Bergman, who pimps herself back to Bogart in order to help the Resistance, is considerably more interesting elsewhere), but the writing is flawless and works of cinema and literature are still being named after the movie's lines of dialogue, one as recently as '95. Ironically, Ronald Reagan was supposed to play Rick Blaine before Humphrey signed on: what the picture might have been with him in the lead is anyone's guess.",10,0,0,15 April 1999
Fight Club," 'Clockwork Orange' this ain't...
","Is 'Fight Club' an endorsement of faschism and violence, or merely a cautionary tale? None of the above. David Fincher's controversial fourth feature is simply put, one big joke, that the unsuspecting audience is subjected to, under the pretense of criticizing modern consumerism and materialism, as well as mourning the loss of true masculinity by today's y-chromosome bearers. Edward Norton, a renegade corporate slave, and Brad Pitt, a flamboyant, mysterious rebel, organize a cult-like establishment where men can turn to for venting of their innate aggression. Before long, the aggression is redirected toward the rest of the world.  The film spews much venom aimed, it seems, at human life in general, occasionally hitting the right spots, provoking the viewer to sport a wicked grin or two, but no more. Fincher's penchant for nihilism does not leave room for any other feelings when viewing these frequently pointless displays of brutality. In the end, especially in the light of the twisted, 'Sixth Sense'-inspired parallel ending which only strengthens the 'joke effect', one gets the impression that the movie is trying to meddle in too many genres at once, while not being powerful or engaging enough to stand outside genre boundaries.",8,3,9,28 December 1999
The Birth of a Nation," Racist Propagana
","How 'Triumph of the Will' can be hailed as a masterpiece is strangely more understandable than the persistent acclaim of this atrocious example of a mass medium used to disseminate ideas of duplicitous evil. From a historical standpoint, Griffith's Civil War and Reconstruction themed saga of three plus hours, was a blueprint for modern narrative film, but do its methodological novelties justify the movie's claim to be a work of art ? Can, in any event, a practical recruitment ad for the Ku Klux Klan, be viewed as a work of art ? Can the climactic 'rescue ride' by the white-hooded clansmen be deemed exciting ? No more so, I daresay, than a pornographic video, no matter how high in quality, which depicts simulated rape or torture. But the latter's existence is in a way, more justifiable, since assisting a disturbed individual to release (usually his) dark fantasy in a safe manner is not the same as an active promotion of hatred. No smutmaker would ever demand legitimate recognition as an artist, and no critic would ever even give so much as a thought to lauding a smut flick, even if it's a personal favorite. But 'Birth of a Nation' has a greater purpose than instant gratification - as the opening intertitles declare, to 'preserve the purity of the Aryan race', and to paint the events as truth, albeit unfortunate. Watching the film in its entirety can be an ordeal which one does not soon forget. It is a spectacle of little dramatic merit : after calculated sentimentality of the prewar exposition, and a few grand-scale battles, the 'Negro savages' (white actors in blackface who act like subhuman troglodytes, bipedal apes) are introduced, and an indignant posse of 'noble white knights' is promptly assembled to liberate the South once and for all. What follows is a spectacle that makes one twitch in disgust and anger, the viewing of which can start a riot in a matter of minutes. Only for educational reasons, to stimulate meaningful discussion, Griffith's opus should not be prohibited from being shown, as any first-amendment protected work. The director himself later repented, making some real cinema with the the obvious title 'Intolerance' in 1916. Why the AFI voters did not include that instead, baffles any intelligent mind.",4,4,9,14 April 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Run, William, Run !
","An entertaining, ultimately shallow, yet well-meaning film, whose numerous verbal anachronisms can be forgiven for its sheer sense of fun. Joseph Fiennes makes for a goofy, doe-eyed Bard, and Paltrow (as his Muse) seems to fit the Elizabethan period well, although aside from her fashionable looks, Gwyneth's acting has little to recommend itself for. Most of all, the screenplay deals with the world of Theatre, the whole writing/production/staging process, here presented in a freespirited manner that at times rings true, but again, is all too superficial. Obvious visual inconsistencies irritate the eye (notably the mysterious accommodation of Paltrow's sumptuous hair under her tiny boyish disguise-wig ),but not enough to ruin the whole show. Perhaps the movie's biggest saving grace is that it rarely slows down, aside from the obligatory love scenes. Of course, the sex here is overdone and glossed over almost unbearably, but not as bad as in most mainstream genre pieces. If anything, it demonstrates that Miramax is truly no longer an 'indie' studio: it has fully accepted all of Hollywood's conventions and restraints. Also, SIL is notable for the second portrayal of Elizabeth I in '98: (this time around she's in her waning years ), probably in her best known context: exuding royal patronage on Shakespeare; a brief, yet definitive performance by Dench, fresh from playing Victoria in '97.",6,1,2,21 January 2000
Taxi Driver," The only flaw is the 'epilogue'.
","Scorcese must have known his Dostoyevsky well, and not strictly in the positive sense. In a decision of startling audacity for the seventies, he created a modern-day Rascolnikov as an emotionally scarred Vietnam vet, plunging into greater madness at the very core of the world's rotten heart: New York City. One who develops his own agenda of redemption, and eventually becomes a near automaton set to eliminate all that he hates at any cost. De Niro, as Travis Bickle is no more a mere promising talent, but a true revelation, a paragon of male urban despair, a picture-perfect definition of a walking timebomb. His metamorphosis into a killing machine is incredibly vivid and tense, a performance that glues to the screen and transcends all boundaries, making you revel in its very depravity and rejoice in the sublimely staged climax through which De Niro almost sleepwalks, blinded by uncontrollable obsession. This is interactive cinema: the kind that takes the viewers' senses into full custody and does not release them until the very last moment. Jodie Foster, unlike Dostoyevsky's fallen saints, plays her part with bitter cynicism combined with hidden vulnerability, a far more appropriate behavior for a teenage prostitute. Bernard Hermann, the man who brought you the 'Psycho' soundtrack creates an equally memorable score. Yes, 'Taxi Driver' would have been an all-around 10, if not for the final three minutes. Just as 'Crime and Punishment''s tacked-on epilogue of dubious 'salvation' spoils the overall experience, so does the film's, which should have ended right at the end of that overhead crane shot of authorities and bystanders arriving on the scene of Travis' ultimate crime.",9,0,0,20 April 1999
Forrest Gump," Worst Oscar Winner of the 90's
","A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The uber-conservative approach takes to US history is frankly misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allen's 'Zelig', the title character involves himself in all of the most famous events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest movements of the 60's and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently Gump-invented slogan: 'S**t happens'. Why create a hero who celebrates stupidity as a national characteristic is anyone's guess. Any true American patriot with an intelligence quotient above 75 would be deeply offended by the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely objective level,  'Forrest Gump' is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly borrow (or makes a very conspicuous 'homage') from such masterpieces as 'Midnight Cowboy', it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible climax, it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks gets into even more of his 'stupid' adventures.",5,4,9,20 April 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An earnest, but not entirely sucessfull attempt at filming the unfilmable.
","Being a lifelong fan of the book, and having re-read it just weeks prior to the viewing, it is completely impossible for me to give Peter Jackson's FOTR an reasonable evaluation from an artistic standpoint. I couldn't help but dissect the film scene-by-scene as opposed to perceiving it as one cinematic whole. At times it felt like a protracted illustration and little else. Perhaps a second or third viewing will correct that. For now, on first impression, I can only say that the film was uneven, at times frustrating. Frustrating because some of its aspects worked beautifully; and some were pulling it into quite the opposite direction. Frustrating because Jackson does have a strong personal vision, yet he did make some grave and obvious concessions to Hollywood. Here's the breakdown:* WARNING! POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD*********************************THE GOOD:1) Visuals: Landscapes and Architecture. Flawless. Majestic. Alan Lee as design consultant worked miracles. And furthermore, it made New Zealand a lucrative travel destination for me.2) Certain Actors. Specifically portraying Gandalf, Bilbo, Sam, a few others... mostly dead-on, much like I always imagined.3) The 'creative license' scenes. Surprisingly enough, most of them did not detract from the movie, and even enlivened it a bit. Arwen's involvement did not seem out of place, and her 'flight to the ford' scene is easily one of the finest setpieces of the whole 3 hours. In fact, I would have liked to see even more of her. The allusions to various chapter titles were in good spirit, and the comic relief for the most part worked decently, although it was somewhat upsetting to see Merry and Pippin reserved strictly for that purpose. The subtitled Elvish was a nice touch, in part because it eliminated the prospect of listening to Aragorn's and Arwen's romantic dialogue in English (!)4) Action Scenes. Nicely staged, esp. the entire Moria sequence.THE MEDIOCRE:1) Heavy Cuts. It's true that the film is rushed. The only clues to how much time elapses between various scenes are periodic edits to the transformation of Isengard, and that is insufficient. Many scenes feel shortened in order to meet the 3 hour obligation, especially those of Lorien and I would hope the more complete version makes it to DVD.2) At times, overdramatic. Some of the players' approach is not very authentic, overly self-aware, Elrond most of all. Aragorn and Boromir overact on occasion, but sparingly. Saruman and Gandalf, bellowing spells at each other across mountain passes come off as a pair of grand opera singers.3) Derivative Effects. While impressive in their own right, the Wizard duel scene, Cave Troll, and Balrog seem to be inspired by latter-day videogames rather than by Tolkien's descriptions.THE BAD:1) Frodo's cleanliness. While Elijah Wood's undoubtedly put his heart and soul into the role, his physical appearance was just a tad bit overpolished. He resembled a CGI model rather than a living, breathing hobbit. And throughout the film, not a speck of dirt seemed to have touched him - does being the ringbearer automatically merit a daily bath in wartime conditions?2) Prologue. Cheezy and unnecessary. Much of it is repeated through subsequent flashbacks anyway. Could have done without it and went on straight to the original storyline. The initial shot of Sauron holding up the ring is laughable, straight out of a grade-Z flick.3)The Soundtrack. Atrocious, absolutely atrocious. The single element of FOTR that tipped the scale toward the negative for me. If it was used half as much, the movie would have been greatly eleveated in my mind. But this generic tripe...too closely reminiscent of Titanic for comfort. Remember that scene in South Park where a character is tortured by Enya's music? - well, that's precisely how I felt.",6,0,0,21 December 2001
Armageddon," Celluloid Diarrhoea
","I didn't bother spending a penny on it, but my brother happened to see it for a buck on his college campus. So here's what he thought:Armageddon is by far the worst piece of cinematic trash since Kevin Kostner's, 'The Postman.' Due to the enormous amount of technical inconsistencies found in this film, the subject will have to be addressed in my upcoming treatise entitled, 'How Armageddon Has Violated Science.' Sections will include, Astronomy, Mechanics, Statistics, Thermodynamics, etc... The overall experience of watching this movie can be likened to a trip to the bathroom that has suddenly gone awry. At first the s**t flows smoothly: the menace of the approaching asteroid, and the group of characters that will be pitted against it are given their crude and brief introductions. Regular action movie shit. Nothing to sweat about. Then there is an explosion of diarrhoea which refuses to cease the flow of its mucky blobs for an excruciating two and a half hours. It comes in the form of downright moronic characters whose main repertoire of macho yelling and grunting is framed by MTV style editing which alternately flashes images of gray, crumbling asteroid turf (reminiscent of nothing other than feces), and dimwitted faces of the men. Some action sequences filmed this way actually make even less sense than an average music video. In some places it becomes next to impossible to figure out exactly what's going on, even though the movie's outcome is just as predictable as that of Apollo 13's. Could the world really end? Could these idiots actually save the planet? It's obvious that they will, but by they end you wish that they would all perish. Making violent, gutter trash men the heroes of the picture, the movie also does a terrible injustice to women, making them look like whining, insignificant, subordinate nervous wrecks. 'Armageddon's' poor quality and its blatant and distasteful use of US patriotism to please audiences places it behind its horrid rival, 'Godzilla.' After watching both, an intelligent person will become convinced that a generation of people raised on movies such as these would not survive an encounter with an asteroid.",3,0,1,21 January 2000
Doctor Zhivago," Does NO justice to novel
","An embarrassment for Lean, an otherwise supremely talented director, with special skill regarding epics. None of his usual complexity is evident here, in fact, none of Pasternak's original novel is either. There's nothing remotely Russian about the overstuffed turkey, which can get so tedious at times, that the fast-forward button seems a blessing. Basically, 'Doctor Zhivago' is high-class Englishmen going through the motions in phony 'exotic' locations. Julie Christie, with her blank stares and pouty lips, possesses all the acting ability of a blow-up doll. Shariff, with all the huffing and puffing, is just about as unconvincing as Zhivago as an actor can get. Smaller roles, like Alec Guiness' chilling KGB bigshot, fare better, but none are playing Russians for a second. Which fantasyland these Brit-accented Commies are in, one simply has not a clue.",6,1,3,20 April 1999
American Beauty," Best Hollywood film of the decade
","Arguably one of the finest dramas to come out of a major studio since modern cinema's heyday in the 70's, 'American Beauty' owes much of its style to a longlasting independent tradition - it's a veritable marriage of Todd Solondz's bitter, detached commentary in the guise of a sitcom-like comedy of errors, and David Lynch's subversive, dark visual poetry, rich in dreams and hidden meanings. And what a glorious marriage this is! Pure irony is juxtaposed with pure tragedy here in a fashion both funny and painful, since the first-time director and a noted stage veteran Sam Mendes permits the audience to actually get to know his characters well (something that most 90's filmmakers, Mike Leigh aside, never bother to do). Essentially, Kevin Spacey's post-mortem recounting of a crisis in two very different disfunctional suburban families, the film speaks volumes of about the trouble with the current American attitudes and social behaviors with surprising eloquence and complexity. Unlike its cynical predecessors who often just throw the wreckage upon us and then leave it be, 'American Beauty' does offer alternatives to the widespread pursuit of happiness through financial success (meditation and aesthetic awareness ), all the while without succumbing to blatant, didactic posturing. No simple solution is offered, however: even the characters who manage to bring themselves closer to the noncoformist, more desirable state of being, achieve it through questionable methods. As close to perfection as the picture may be, a few inevitable flaws do creep in (a predictable, Hollywood score; a few cases of overstatement, when the plot carries itself a tad bit further then credibility would allow), yet none inflict enough damage to lessen the overall effect of this superior work that should serve as a wake-up call to a nation of self-deluding automatons.",9,0,0,28 December 1999
American History X," weak directorially, strong performances nevertheless
","The scandal of Tony Kaye disowning his work and condemning New Line who took it away before he could realize his 90-minute cut is well publicized by now. And it's no surprise why the director became so enraged: American History X is definitely in need of major editing. In it's two hour theatrical version, this study of California skinheads seems haphazard and even amateurish at times. The studio's attempt to improve the film actually made it much worse:the picture looks like an effort by an ambitious, self-indulgent high school student assisted by his far less inspired teacher. Most of the black-and-white sequences (flashbacks of Norton's and Furlong's life as skinhead brothers) are much more powerful and beautifully shot than the trite and cheaply melodramatic color scenes set in the present day. One cannot help but contemplate this film's potential on all levels of production: for one, it should have used a more urgent and appropriate soundtrack of modern hip-hop and hardcore instead of the typical Hollywood solution to all dramas which we've all heard literally hundreds of times; and also cut down on the slow motion, arguably the most gratuitous since The Postman. Still, Norton's extraordinary performance and several thought-provoking scenes make one wonder what the movie could have been if Kaye was allowed to perfect his material without intervention.",6,2,7,21 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," significant flaws abound, but has merit
","After making such inexcusable trash as The Lost World, Spielberg just can't be taken seriously (neither can Tom Hanks, after Forrest Gump), no matter how hard he tries. And in his most recent attempt at redemption, he doesn't succeed in the slightest: He simply cannot refrain from being the typical Spielberg with his heavy-handed, lofty and ultimately sappy direction. The problem here is not the film per-se, it's the fact that he tries to pass it to us as Reality :the supreme truth about WWII. In fact, not only there are many visible historical and strategic inaccuracies, but most importantly, the human interaction is injected with familiar Spilbergian fakeness I coudn't help noticing. The dialogue, aside from a couple of obligatory f-words and a few explicit sexual references, feels at least fifty years old, when the Hollywood Character Actors went about delivering grand, all-important speeches, and witty , crowdpleasing lines. Sorry, Steven, but if you wanted to 'keep it real', you should've cut down on melodramatics or better yet, hired a different screenwriter. The soldiers suffer from a lack of character development, and remain nothing but polished stereotypes, their emotional responses not always justified. If all the obvious false-note subplots that make this a Spielberg vehicle would be removed (Hanks' trembling hand, the German prisoner's hysterical clowning, one of the privates' 'symbolic' confrontation with the enemy as a Jew, and so on), SPR's level of realism would have been consistent enough to allow for it's now-classic status. The main reasons to view this film, of course, are the two Battle Scenes, enveloping the story, (much like in the Wild Bunch). Only here, instead of using Peckinpah's now-cliched slow motion violence, the scenes are shot in real-time, or even speeded up slightly to an amazing effect. John Williams, thank god, quiets down for the duration of both scenes and lets us listen to the actual sounds of war without any musical interference. The first scene, the Storming of Omaha Beach, is so tension-packed, exciting and simultaneously terrifying, that it could well be the best of its kind. The last one,(a small group of men versus a veritable army - hmmm,where have I seen THIS before?) is almost as good, if not for the cheap Hollywood trick at the very end, which finds the movie venturing into Indiana Jones territory. It almost seems that SPR was directed by TWO different people: Spielberg and his WWII battle consultant. On the very primal level, however, the film achieves at least one of its makers' many aspirations: when I exited the theatre, I felt lucky to be alive.",7,0,0,6 August 1999

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Superior to the first installment!
","After a year of anticipation, increasingly intense with each day of waiting, each spoiler revealed, and each rave early review read, the second part of LOTR has finally arrived. As a wary filmgoer who seldom wastes money on current cineplex junk, I was naturally concerned whether this colossal undertaking will live up to my expectations, let alone its equally collossal hype.Perhaps, The Two Towers is an easier book to adapt cinematically, because it is more action-based, and its main events occur during a more condensed time period - weeks as opposed to months or years. On the other hand, it creates greater challenges in terms of intercutting between three separate storylines. Peter Jackson does a near-flawless job facing up to these challenges, and largely succeeds. The flaws are still there, but they are less jarring. The 'gloom and doom' yet hopeful spirit of Tolkien's second book is present in spades, and again - painstalking detail is lavished on all visual aspects of Middle Earth.Now, the usual discussion of strengths and weaknesses - and the latter are definitely fewer this time around.WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! -----------------------------------------------THE GOOD:1) My favorite character in the entire book was always Gollum, and Jackson's team along with Andy Serkis absolutely nail him. He is best acted and most complex of all, a feat for a CGI creature. As another reviewer said, 'Jar-Jar is not fit to lick Gollum's ass', a view which I wholeheartedly agree with. When Gollum/Serkis remembers his past as Smeagol, the moment alone is worth the price of admission. Personalit(ies) indeed go a long way. Nearly every scene in the book that featured Gollum is reproduced here, with great accuracy, even the 'rabbit stew' scene! The final scene of the film is extremely effective, possibly one of the finest.2) Gimli - yes, he is largely relegated to necessary comic relief, but he is funny, not laughable. His character is actually well realized, because a Dwarf would truly feel like a fish out of water in such foreign surroundings. He also gets to save the day more than a few times. I have a feeling he'll have even more to say and do in the Extended DVD.3) Merry and Pippin display passion and wit, taking their development further.4)The movie is historically/geographically minded, and handles various new places and concepts well. The fans even get references to the Bombadil Story omitted from FOTR - the Old Forest and the Barrow-Whigths (Gollum sings their song). All of the landscapes are gorgeous, and 100% Alan Lee.5) Of course, the epic feel is tremendous and the action spectacular. It is unneeded to even mention. At times it seemed like I was watching something out of the Iliad.THE NOT-SO-BAD:1) Arwen and Aragorn came off well, at least non-distracting. The sequence of Arwen mourning and wandering the woods alone was starltingly beautiful.2) Faramir I never cared much about, so his motivation changes did not bother me. The actor playing him was not very strong however, and didn't impress me. Good thing he had little screen time.3) Treebeard was decent, not quite as I would have liked but in the context of the film, the ents worked. I know that they will get additional scenes in the DVD from Jackson's interview. Their scenes appeared choppy. The Destruction of Isengard, though, was magnificent - goosebump-worthy.4) The music was still excessive, but better. The Rohan theme was more pleasing to the ear than any pseudo-Titanic pap.THE NOT-SO-GOOD:1) The Rohan 'women and children' storyline. Used purely for dramatic purposes, cheesy and worn-out. Could have done without it.2) Sam's long speech about heroic endurance at the end needed some editing. Jackson is not a director known for subtelty.3) Haldir's real death and Aragorn's fake one were overdone (slow-motion bathos syndrome) , but that is a fairly minor complaint.4) CGI was spotty in places (the wargs and oliphaunts come to mind), but not enough to ruin the scenes. In fact, none the action scenes falter much.
------------------------------------------------------------In closing, I am pleased that TTT not only lived up to the hype/expectations, but managed to exceed them on almost all accounts. A gleeful smile has hardly left my face in all 3 hours, and my expression changed to an annoyed cringe only once or twice - far less than during Fellowship. I have to say that this film was the one (in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre) that I enjoyed the most ever since the good old days of the original Star Wars Trilogy, and I do not say that lightly.",9,0,0,20 December 2002
Schindler's List," By no means perfect
","This grandiose opus Spielberg directed to cement his name as a 'serious' filmmaker, stands in a very dubious position : its very subject is so sacred and untouchable to the civilized world (including film critics), that questioning the film's integrity as of late has been almost equated to denying the Holocaust itself. The truth, however is bitter: 'Schindler's List' is far from perfect. Spielberg, previously known for his family-oriented, gawking adventure yarns that usually were as far away from tangible reality as possible, indeed has surprised everyone with the heartwrenching brutality of the Jewish victims' suffering, which he vividly depicts. The most powerful scenes in the film work on a purely instinctive level: they're silent and do not involve familiar individuals, they play almost like some perversely voyeuristic yet priceless footage of Nazi atrocities. The wisely chosen, eloquent black and white cinematography is a definite highlight. Everything else, for the most part, has Spielberg at his old game: he was always best at spectacle, and worst at character development. A dozen or so Jews are singled out as 'types', and are traced throughout the film. In over three hours, we learn absolutely nothing about them, they're merely sheep to be saved by Schindler. The man himself is provided with almost no real explanation for his change from an opportunistic slaveowner to a righteous saint-like figure. In the last ten minutes, he simply steps out of character and lapses into a stagy farewell; seductively tearjerking, but completely out of place in a movie that aspires to an authentic representation of the Holocaust. The only character that even begins to approach three-dimensionality is the local Nazi henchman , (Ralph Fineness), one of the most interesting portrayals of a villain in recent cinema. Despite its considerable problems, 'Schinler's list' is still widely used to introduce the new, unsophisticated audience to the mid-twentieth century horrors: whether or not is should be, remains open to debate.",8,4,10,20 April 1999
Pi," pretentious but watchable cult flick
","A cross between Travis Bickle, Henry Spencer (you cannot be truly hip if you don't know either), and your typical high school geek, wanders around NYC trying to find mathematical order in the universe. Along the way, he is being destroyed by his own inexplicable fits and various factions (high class businessmen, Orthodox Jews), who desire to possess the code. Upon close observation, 'Pi' is not as revolutionary or original as it may seem. If anything, it recalls David Lynch's astonishing 1978 debut, also black and white. The similarities are many, there's even a 'girl next door', albeit more attractive than Lynch's. But Aaronofsky is unclear on which venue to pursue, and his film walks the thin line between Avant-Garde and a contrived Thriller. That is precisely why it can't be totally cohesive or enjoyable. By the second half, the Avant-Garde visions become repetitive, and the Thriller twists all too predictable and even ludicrous. On the other hand, an intense, eeiry and captivating electronica score that captures the whole atmosphere of the movie, is of great help, and the whole premise of a genius making sense of the universe's mechanism is unique and admirable, especially in the light of today's mindless junk cinema. Flawed as it is, Pi is the only film in the past few years which makes the audience contemplate a philosophical point of view they might not be comfortable with. For that it should be praised. Those looking for a true masterpiece of surrealism should rent 'Erraserhead' instead.",7,3,4,21 January 2000
Mulholland Drive," Master & Margarita meets Vertigo - bold, brilliant stuff!
","Don't call it a comeback, he's been here for years - and hopefully for many more years to come - David Lynch is truly the only remaining American director from that great 70's generation who is still capable of enthralling his audience. He knows well that they have seen everything, every imaginable plot twist, and yet he manages to surpass any and all expectations, to disregard all convention and lovingly proceed with a vision uniquely his - the trademark dreamscape with layers of sinister perversion underneath. We are pulled in, and emerge some 2+ hours later from a sensual experience more enjoyable and powerful than any intoxicant. At first, a scorching, hellish version of Los Angeles is presented, where strange, supernatural, possibly infernal characters interfere with the status quo of comically drawn Hollywood types - much like the opening chapters of the famous Bulgakov novel where the devil and his companions come to Moscow and wreak havoc in the literary circles. The local powers that be are ridiculed in a very similar fashion. But before one has time to get comfortable with the narrative's course, a torrid relationship bursts on the scene and suddenly we are in a very different place, physically and emotionally. After a hypnotic climax (Llorando will indeed make you weep), comes the equally bizzare denouement which purposefully leaves more questions than answers.Still, the end result is enormously satisfying - various parts of the film linger for days, weeks... Exquisite style and color, old-fashioned Hitchcockian camerawork, effective use of seemingly innocent 50's pop (Sixteen Reasons never sounded creepier) as counterpoint to Lynch's dark brushstrokes all work to near-perfection. This is a shot in the arm for those who are giving up on cinema.",10,2,3,10 January 2002
Life Is Beautiful," Begnini is no Chaplin
","There is no subject in the world sacred or horrific enough that it cannot be dramatized for cinema. Holocaust, because it occurred so recently, is deemed an unfilmable taboo by many. Some of the people I know, refused to see Benigni's controversial film out of sheer principle. I resisted seeing it as well, but not because of the nature of its topic. Everything can be approached from many different angles, and in this case, Comedy has the most risk in striking wrong notes with the viewers. At times, Comedy ,particularly in the guise of social satire, can expose truth and even present it in a bold, provocative manner. But a Holocaust comedy? Of course, life in the concentration camp can provide plenty of material for life-affirming sentimentality, but as presented in 'Life is Beautiful' it is obviously FALSE. This is simply milking a historical event of great importance to modern humanity, for the purpose of luring an unsophisticated audience to admire one's work. Benigni without a doubt makes a talented comic, and the first half of the film, when his big-mouthed character mocks Italian fascism, IS funny, precisely because it's satire. As soon as he and his on-screen son are shipped off to the camp, the object of ridicule becomes less clear. What we get is a soft toned, PG-rated, annoyingly unrealistic treatment of unspeakably brutal conditions, where death and disease prevailed. In a fantasy or a science fiction setting, the duo's exploits could have worked, but to anyone who is aware of history, they would seem implausible. It's surely a noble effort to protect one's child from the terrifying reality by pretending that the whole setting is a game, but unfortunately, had it been a real camp, both father and son would have perished within a week of their ordeal: the later would die of starvation, the former be shot on sight for excessive talking or better yet, silenced by his irritated fellow prisoners. Chaplin, whom the director is often compared to, in The Great Dictator, never even tried to exploit the 'Final Solution'; wisely, he stuck to Hitler and his henchmen. Besides, Chaplin was most brilliant at silent comedy. Benigni, on the other hand, just can't seem to shut up.",5,12,26,6 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," does not live up to Kubric's standard
","In his old age, the late great Stanley Kubric may well have gone off the deep end, much like a character in one of his last films, 'The Shining', as this pointless and underdeveloped urban epic demonstrates. Does as banal a subject as martial fidelity problems require such a grandiose, overstuffed and overacted treatment ? Is a sequence where an 18th century venetian carnival is coupled with an orgiastic cult ritual have any relation to modern borgeuois America? Would prominent citizens or anyone for that matter actually want to engage in the kind of debauchery witnessed by Cruise ? Does a movie which opens with Nicole Kidman's bare behind and closes with her utterance of the f-word have reasonable merit? Odd characters who drop in and out of the plot, a ludicrous pseudo-suspense of the piano score, an extremely slow buildup which ends abruptly at about a third of its logical progression, are some of the picture's more baffling aspects. Indeed, the question that arises as the credits begin to roll is not 'what happened?', but 'why?' Why was Kubric compelled to make this ? Was it the voyeristic prospect of working with Nicole and scores of other nude women? Hopefully not just that. Regardless of his motives, the end result by no means makes the impression of a total waste, possessing the kind of lush camerawork we'd come to expect over the years, as well as a consistent level of interest that renders 'Eyes Wide Shut', like all of the auteur's creative output, worthy of discussion and repeat viewing.",7,0,0,17 August 1999
Some Like It Hot," As hot as it gets
","A Comedy that has it all, and lacks absolutely nothing. 'Nobody's perfect' may be an inherent truism, but 'Some Like it Hot' is a definite somebody in the universe of cinema, thus it IS perfect in every sense. Swing, sex and slapstick, (three words that immediately come to mind when trying to describe it) , are a mix so delicious, so fruitful in its possibilities that one cannot imagine a film which can live up to them, and yet this one does. Marilyn, her trademark, displeasingly infantile voice aside, is a bombshell of thermonuclear dimensions, whose powers of titillation will not expire so long as there are hormones and/or Viagra. The sexual content, for socio-historical reasons cannot be as explicit as we've come to expect, but there's still plenty of it, from Monroe's see-through outfit to the double entendre worthy of the Farelli Brothers ('What do I do if it's an emergency ? - Pull the emergency break!' ), including overtly gay themes that have a cult following of their own. The Lemmon/Curtis duo operates with gleeful, unrestrained vitality that can only be likened to Chaplin in his heyday. Though not a Musical, the combustive energy of this movie is so stimulating it almost makes you get up and dance.",10,47,74,20 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," I'd rather watch 'The Shining' over...
","A surprise hit of the year, and completely undeserving attention at that. The plot of this slow-building horror-noir, heavily drawing on cult classics like the certain 1980 movie directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick, is not without merits, courtesy of a poignant treatment of a disturbed, misunderstood child prodigy. The supernatural elements of the film, on the other hand are contrived to such extremes that they are not believable at all and lack the power to truly frighten. Bruce Willis, as the child psychologist with a tough case and an unhappy marriage, should be given proper credit for restrained, realistic acting. But neither he, nor his gifted young patient can fix the holes in the scenery, which, if properly scrutinized, will reveal inexcusable and ludicrous inconsistencies. The consistently solemn, dour tone set to painfully conventional 'gloomy suspense' music, does not improve the picture either; and the so-called 'surprise ending' which everyone seems to be so fascinated with, makes VERY LITTLE SENSE if given sufficient thought.",3,9,22,28 December 1999
The Thin Red Line," An 8 out of 10
","For Spielberg, the world's most popular filmmaker, it's only natural to indulge in fraudulent pomposity and shameless audience manipulation. Terrence Malick, who hasn't yet experienced the pitfalls of fame, is in a way, a direct opposite.  In 1998's second WWII epic, TRL (concentrating on the battle for Guadacanal in the Pacific phase of the war) , he proves to be a nonconformist to the bone, delivering a highly personal, uncompromising vision and sacrificing such essential principles as a coherent narrative structure for the sake of his individualism. Many of the world's greatest directors were rebels with a cause , creating masterpieces in their own unique styles, but with Malick, unfortunately, this is not the case. His bending of the rules does not amount to a satisfying whole: never surpassing Saving Private Ryan, the film is often frustrating and downright incomprehensible. TRL seems to completely disobey the laws of cinematic physics: after an excruciating  middle sequence, the movie loses momentum and continues for another hour without a climax in sight, alienating and bewildering the viewers, instead of channeling their intensity towards a final, necessary release. The lopsided, barely visible conclusion fails to involve them. What further complicates matters is the often indistinguishable off-camera narrations by at least five different characters: keeping track of all the perspectives is a daunting task, in a film riddled with faces that quickly dissapear from view and from the plot. Famous actors (Travolta, Clooney, Harrelson): appear for as little as a minute each, unnecessarily distracting from the rest of the cast, since they have no time to develop a character that can replace their own public images as big stars. While most of the soldiers are not walking stereotypes, like in SPR all are underdeveloped, leaving us in hopes of a deeper investigation. Finally, the nature of the voice-overs is often banal and is much better left unsaid. The universal questions about the relationship between nature and humanity, good and evil, and the like, should arise in the viewer's mind without additional sonic assistance, since Malick's images speak for themselves. Eventually, his philosophical asides become forced and cliched, much like Spileberg's tearjerking patriotism. The positive aspects of the film cannot, in the long run, overshadow the negative ones, but they do offer us an experience not easily forgotten. TRL is shot from an unseen observer's point of view, constantly zooming in on priceless details: some horryfying and some touching in their realism. The mis-en-scenes and individual frames, depicting men in their primordial surroundings with intricate and violent beauty, can only be likened to those of Kurosawa.  Some 100 minutes or so,  form a protruded battle scene: the storming of the Japanese hilltop fortification and the pillage of their encampment. This 'middle sequnece' is nothing short of absolute brilliance. Often lapsing into an almost 'Doom'-like stlyle of some deranged, esoteric videogame, the camera explores the 'green hell' that is Malick's vision of war.  The incredible tension generated by this assault soon dies down, and never quite regains itself, leaving the audience  numb  for the remaining hour. Any anticipation of a fitting conclusion, a final cathartic battle, remains unfulfilled.  But all flaws aside, the director should be given full credit for making a challenging , unconventional film without any commercial aspirations (except, perhaps, the all-star cast).  While Spielberg begins his work with a plot device, overblown and predictable; TRL opens with a single symbolic image: stirring and original.",8,0,0,31 December 1998
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Blueprint of Modern Black Comedy
","Where do you think such hip 90's favorites as 'Pulp Fiction', 'Clerks' and 'South Park' got their inspiration? Just one of the many influences: does the irreverent discussion of European vs. African swallows remind you of John Travolta/Samuel L. Jackson's famous 'quarter pounder with cheese' exchange ? To be fair, Monty Python itself hails from an important tradition of subversive humor that, at least in the cinematic world dates back to the days of Buster Keaton. Then of course, came the Marx Brothers,  the Golden Age of Warner Bros. Cartoons (1937-1957, arguably THE most influential humor of the century), and 'Dr.Strangelove'. But Monty Python really set the pace for the kind of absurdist satire we know and love today. The impact of 'Holy Grail' reaches far and wide - from Michael Keaton's horseless galloping in Kenneth Branagh 'Much Ado about Nothing' to the Columbine High Shootings('It's just a flesh wound' was reputedly a favorite quote of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold).",10,0,0,4 January 2000
Gangs of New York," Bloody Awful
","What is it with film directors that they cannot produce consistently good work once fame and reverence goes to their head? Scorsese is considered the greatest US filmmaker still active (by all those who don't think so of Spielberg). Much like his endlessly-feuding, barbaric, mid-19th century New Yorkers, the man seems to have worn his welcome in history, and what a sad, sad realization that is.His masterpieces ('Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas'), will always remain such, and hopefully endure in the annals of cinema. But why, why such travesty?Abandoning his unique style in favor of a concoction between 'Moulin Rouge' and 'Braveheart' (with a bit of 'The Postman' thrown in for good measure), Scorsese, in his apparent eagerness to catch up to the 21st century, seems to have adopted the worst traits of modern moviemaking. The next step in this witches' brew of a film is assembling the most familliar and tired screenwriting cliches, grinding them, stirring them to a boil, and then pouring them out onto the screen. Add to that a haphazard, sluggish editing, which may or may not be the result of Scorsese's battle with Miramax. Then some generic actors who clearly look uncomfortable and not even very significant before such a gigantic ego. Construct a post-apocalyptic looking set, and include a CGI(!) elephant stampede during the climax. Shall I even continue?GONY's underlying themes are even more dubious and incomprehensible - what are we supposed to make of the primitive stab at Civil-War America's social/ethnic urban politics? Vengeance, religion, parenthood, and yes, democracy - are distilled to a comic-book level.What has happened to the master who in his heyday created such dynamic, urgent, intoxicating (and subtle, in their own inimitable fashion) character studies? After seeing this grandiose folly, one wishes that Scorsese would have taken a graceful exit, and retired or stuck to film preservation. Bergman, for example, has not made a feature film in almost 20 years, and that makes him no less great...",4,10,24,25 January 2003
The Godfather," Most accomplished US film
","This epic of epics, in my wholehearted view, remains to this day America's  most accomplished feature film. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the storyline's elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time. What makes it so enormously appealing and deeply satisfying is Copolla's masterful direction. Every frame is constructed in such an ingenious manner, that if taken out of context and hung up on a wall as a painting, it would take up another value, becoming as work of art in and of itself. Indeed, it is tempting to compare the dark indoor compositions (the mise-en-scenes' arrangement especially) to Rembrandt and other Dutch masters, without exaggeration. The staging of each scene is handled with the kind of technical and spiritual balance advocated only in Eastern religions: no extreme close-ups, no jittery or stale camera movements. On a visual level, 'The Godfather' possesses an ethereal beauty regardless of content. The picture's other aspects reveal an astounding proximity to irrefutable perfection: an immortal original score with at least three distinguished motifs; the superlative acting by all of the Corleone Mafia clan and their enemies; the compelling plot which swiftly unfolds before us through, among other things, the most riveting montage since 'Battleship Potemkin', no less. Even its minute details are widely quoted today: what comes most easily to mind is the shot-by-shot parody of Brando's botched assassination in '99's 'Analyze This', and the more obscure slang term : 'to pull a Fredo', coined  in 'Swingers' (one of the 90's hippest comedies). Just to decipher the later (decidedly dirty) reference should be a good excuse to watch 'The Godfather' yet again.",10,0,1,20 April 1999
