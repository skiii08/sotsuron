National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Goonies for Grownups
","I would actually give this films 6.8 out of 10. It's better than a 6 not good enough for a 7. This is a fun, family film with Nicolas Cage returning as the decipher of government secret hidden in public views. This time, its about clearing his family name as some guy comes up and claims his family was part of the group that conspired to kill Abe Lincoln.The cool thing about this film is that it makes you believe that all t his stuff could be possible. That if you look at a dollar bill closely, look at the constitution closely, you would find stuff their that was hidden for anybody to decipher. The film takes you around the world and back again in it's Indiana-Jones like action adventure. It's like Goonies for Grownups. And if you like Goonies, you will like National Treasure. It's not complicated, its not a serious political thriller. Its the right film at the right time when you don't want to see another fake biopic (dewey cox), or the Oscar contenders. When you want to see a film that reminds you of summer past blockbuster, go see National Treasure. Nothing new, nevertheless entertaining.",6,1,2,29 December 2007
Sucker Punch," Love the movie, just a tad issue with the writing
","I love the movie. Great idea. I have been anticipating the movie since I first saw the preview last year with the music of Silversun Pickups. The movie is about a girl who gets thrown into an insane asylum and how she internally deals with it. First - the movie plays a bit like a video game and maybe that is on purpose. But it is a very very cool video game and I wanted these scenes to last a little longer. The problem I had was that the director didn't string the scenes all that well together. It's noticeable but it is minor. I see how it is very heavily influence from Watchmen. SECOND- The music for the movie is ON POINT!! The director not only choose the music, and some of the music may sound familiar, but he has different artists singing. Music and visuals works well together. I can tell you, it is as different of a movie that I expected it to be, so that is a good thing. I just wish the writing was a tad bit better... this movie felt short like it was missing something. But I really like people who go for it and who don't make cookie cutter movies. And this movie is FAR removed from being cookie cutter.",5,4,7,26 March 2011
Us," It didn't live up to the the Anticipation
","Let me say.. GREAT Trailer. Unfortunately they give away WAY too much in the trailer to make this as enjoyable as it should be and maybe that is why I just thought it was just OK.Jordan Peele hit it out of the park with Get Out. With US, its more like a ground rule double...Let me also say that Lupita is just amazingly beautiful and she can act. Winston Duke.. eh.. I don't know what he was trying to do with his lines. He sounded like he was in a skit trying to sound like a suburbia person.The film really suffers from pacing... I heard a few audience members say 'I can't wait until this is over'.
It's a good concept.. but it didn't seem fleshed out fully. And they completely wasted Elisabeth Moss (Handmaid's Tale) but maybe that was on purpose.Over all, good effort. I really, really wanted to like it and maybe I am scoring it to high. I feel I am scoring it to high.. At no point did I feel scared or creeped out like the trailer made me feel. I will give it a solid C. I",7,2,6,22 March 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," And this is how the world ends
","Don't think!  Just watch!  That should be the printed on the posters.  It just a good enough film to showcase a few special effects. And here is a newsflash... ITS LIKE ALL OTHER DISASTERS FILMS BEFORE IT.  I did enjoy the special effects and the less than passable storyline.  But you have to remember that this movie sole purpose is to entertain.  To destroy stuff and to give that false hope that they give us in every flick of this nature.  I did like the special effects but it wasn't enough destruction for the story that was being provided.  These are the same guys that brought us ID4 and it seemed they had some left-over special effects they wanted to use.  They are certainly no writers due to the lame and over used dialogue, but dialogue is not the point of this picture.  This film is also best seen on a big screen. I saw it at a drive in with a bunch of friends and this is the perfect drive-in movie.  This is the film to eat popcorn, drink sodas, stuff yourself with hotdogs and when it's over there is nothing to really think about.  Its good entertainment to waste time with family and friends.  It's not thought provoking, not controversial and you will not be blown away, but it's good cheesy fun and we all need those types of films from time to time. So go to the drive in and watch the world get destroy.",Null,0,1,22 June 2004
Thor: Ragnarok," It is why you go to the movies
","This is just simply an extremely fun and entertaining movie from start to finish. And it is a family friendly movie (probably no kid under 7 or 8). This has all the humor of character and all the action of the previous superhero movies. It has great pacing and not a single solitary boring moment. DC needs to seriously think about hiring these directors. I had a bit of inside info going in. I've read Planet Hulk and World War Hulk so I know about a few incidents and it didn't disappoint. And it has some wonderful cameo appearance. And I love, love, love Cate Blanchett as the main villain. She isn't over the top and she is just simply delicious in her role. I didn't want the film to end. I'm writing this pretty generic and spoiler free. But do yourself a favor and just go see it.",9,2,10,2 November 2017
Silent Hill," Disappointing
","This wasn't as good as I thought it would be and I guess that is all on me. Despite the performance of Radha Mitchell this movie just took too long in-between scenes. Don't get me wrong, there are some moments that I thought were intense, but just not enough of them. And there is just too many things that don't make sense. Between what the husband and wife characters were doing, it was as if you were watching two different movies and they leave way too many things unexplained. I haven't played the video game and perhaps that is where my knowledge is lacking. But one shouldn't have to play the game in order for the film to be coherent. It just miss the boat, but barely. It had potential, to quote Marlon Brando, it 'could have been a contender'.",5,1,5,24 April 2006
Knocked Up," So This is what passes for Comedy?
","This isn't the worst film nor the best film, but after hearing so much about it, it was the most disappointing comedy of 2007. The humor is flat, the relationship is totally unbelievable. The plot surrounds a hot blonde (Kate) out celebrating her promotion to on screen on E!, she has a one night stand with ultimate slacker dude (Seth). They go their separate ways and weeks later she calls him up and tells him she is pregnant. He is a guy who lives with other guys and their main goal in life is weed and porn and yet, she starts falling for the guy because (and sarcasm is coming up), they have so much in common! So the humor is suppose to be how surprisingly shock she is when she finds his humor crude,oafish, and that of a highschool senior. Unfortunately, for me, this become boring after 10 minutes and it goes on throughout the movie. He says the inappropriate things, always, seemingly at the wrong time. It's the typical, and I do mean, by-the-books, typical star-cross romantic comedy, where, at the end, he decided to clean up his act and change his ways and she learns to accept his friends. Give us something different. It's like we keep getting spinoffs from The Wedding Crashers and Bruce Almighty. You know, Bruce Almighty & Wedding Crashers begot 40 Year old Virgin, 40 Year Old Virgin begot, Knocked Up and now Knocked UP begets Superbad. I am sure that the guy who played McLovin will have his own film. Knocked Up is a spin off of a spin off of a spin off and each one gets less funnier. There are only a couple of really funny moments in the movie but overall this film is in the middle of the road. Humorous, yes, but outrageously funny, not even close.",5,3,7,25 February 2008
Suicide Squad," It did its job to entertain
","I think ultra fans will hate this film but I thought the film was entertaining. You sort of going to have to do you homework a bit if you don't know who these guys are. They are DC villains and since the rise of the anti-hero, DC decided that it would be fun to through a 'what if' scenario. What if the villain becomes the hero and thus the Suicide Squad, named so because the government wouldn't care if they die. The movie does a brief introductions to each villain and assumes that the audience knows who they are.. and if you don't, if may be confusing. After that brief intro the movie just jumps right into it. Between the intro and 'the mission'.. there is a giant plot (or lack of plot) hole. Will Smith is the unofficial leader of the bad guys and Will Smith plays Will Smith in all his movies. Listen its not a clean movie. It is, truly like a live issue of a comic book. Lots of action. i wasn't bored. A lot of the other villains (outside of DeadShot and Harley Quinn) are kind of glossed over. Maybe I like it because Batman vs Superman was long and boring. This was short and to the point. If you want more, see another movie.",7,2,4,10 August 2016
Oblivion," A really good Sci-Fi flick, beautiful imagery
","First, I recommend going to the theater to see this movie because it was made to be shown on a massive screen. I thought it was a really good Sci-Fi flick, good story line, good pacing. My friend and I never once found ourselves board. They did a good job of telling the story. It starts off with the future and throughout the movie you find exactly what happened. Tom Cruise is kind of like a more 'action' oriented Wall-E. As he and his manager are left to fix the drones that roam the earth. And you know, with any destitute place you always will have a monkey wrench thrown into the mix, but its a really good monkey wrench. Its a gorgeously looking picture and the thing about Sci-Fi vs action for me is that is about, could it be believable.. and I say yes. It has good action scenes in it as well. I compare it to Prometheus and it has better pacing and more action than that movie, although they have about the same scale. I recommend seeing it on a large screen because the scale of the imagery and the job at hand is really beautiful. I saw it on an IMAX screen.",7,1,2,21 April 2013
The Village," A fan of m. night's but not a fan of this film
","The Village, the latest film from producer, director, writer and actor M. Night is a story about a small village surrounded by trees and mysterious creatures that roams the woods.  The creatures and the villagers live in harmonious peace as long as the villages don't ever enter the woods.  Ah, but something is a-foul here and, or course, that trust is broken.  So anyone that is familiar with M. Night's films, they know there is a twist in the film.  When they reveal the twist in the films, I was thinking, so what.  There is nothing shocking, nothing unique, in fact the film is rather boring.  It is slow in the beginning, slow in the middle, had a couple of interesting points, but that is about it.  I mean, you are going to be sitting there and really not care.  They have the ever boring William Hurt who mistakes indifference for acting.  Joaquim Phoenix repeats his same sense of acting he used in SIGNS in this film and while it seems fresh in SIGNS, he style is quite boring in this film.  Sigourney Weaver is just a name in this film and completely wasted.  She isn't require to do much but be a familiar face you have seen in films before.  Adrian Brody does a good job, a bit over the top at times, but it's nice to see him getting more parts and he pulls his character off rather well.  The bright spot, the star of the film is Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard.  I guess those acting classes really paid off.  She reminds me of a younger Mia Farrow.    But the main problem is the writing.  It is so uninspiring and M. Night's gimmick is getting kind of old now.  It is obvious that Alfred Hitchcock was a big influence on him in not only in film making, but now it becomes a game to see if you can spot the director.  Still, I cannot fault the young director because he is trying and he is different.  Unfortunately the advertisement for the Village is better than the actual movie.  I just wish the film lived up to it's potential.",6,0,0,4 August 2004
Knowing," An extremely enjoyable movie with a horrible Title
","I almost skipped out on this highly well made film because of Nick Cage's previously two films and the fact that from the previews that this looked like a Davinci Code rip off. This movie is much better than the Davinci Code (and nothing like it). Cage plays a scientist who discovers that a recently unearthed time capsule has a numbered piece of paper that predicted major future catastrophes where there is a high body count. Being a scientist, this challengers his way of thinking (obviously) and he is on a quest to find out what's next. Also thrown into the mix is the fact that not only is he brilliant, but he is a single father of a very intelligent young boy.So let me just say this, this movie is rather PG13 and its is extremely intense for children. In fact, because of some of the images, I am surprise this film didn't get an R rating. I would not take anyone under the age of 15 to this film. I heard audience members saying that they are going to have nightmares and about 5 people left because it was so intense. I am a grown man and the accident scenes were some of the most intense I've seen in movies. But it was 100 percent believable. I got to warn you though, the first half of the movie (30-45 minutes) is a bit slow and dry, but once the film gets going, it moves at a pretty good clip. This is a summer blockbuster type of movie that has such a bad title, that the title itself (and the so-so preview) may prevent people from going to this movie. But the special effects are FIRST class. And the film didn't over do it (like the Day After). It's a drama/action/horror movie and its awesome. I highly recommend going to this film and seeing it on a big screen. You will surprise yourself on how much you will like it. I sure did. Still, I cannot stress this one point enough again. There are some extremely intense, graphic images that isn't appropriate for children and because of the theme of the movie, you may find that your kids will need some reassuring from you.",7,1,3,29 March 2009
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Game Changer
","Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron ManWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.Plus our the villains are so well done..But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.",10,316,437,21 December 2018
Van Helsing," Weak Action Film with Weak Monsters
","This movie is souless.  Its not bad and its not good.  In fact, its so boring it's barely watchable.  The writing is absolutely atrocious.  It's as if they piece the script together from other films.  It absolutely brings nothing original to the screen.  You seen everything here before done much much better.  The actors seem as if they are mailing in their performances. And that crap with the Friar and tying him into Q from James Bond almost made me want to leave the theater.  I've seen Van Helsing played better by older men with less effect and no modern weapons.  Obvious the blame is squarely on Sommers.  All he did was took his shell from The Mummy and inserted different characters.  He had no idea what to do with his leading lady and his leading man, as the same with the Mummy, is just trying to be a weaker version of Indiana Jones.  You will recognize all sorts of films in this movie: Mask of Zorro, The Mummy, Underworld (with all the blue in the movie), James Bond, Indiana Jones.  It's just a formula film whose formula needs to be retired.  There is absolutely no passion in this film.  No risk taking, nothing that WOWS you.  You would only see this movie once you exhaust all other ideals on what to do with your evening.  And guess what, you can tell it's lifeless from the previews.  And the funny part of it all, is that you pull for this film to be better while you are watching it. You want them to go that extra steps, but apparently the director just doesn't have the confidence to do so and in the end the audience gets cheated.",4,0,0,11 May 2004
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Movie
","I've never read any of the books (Potter or this one), so I go into all of these movies completely blind. This was done very well. Families, singles, adults, and kids... all will be highly entertained. This is different than the Potter movies because these aren't folks who are trying to learn their craft, they know it so they aren't limited using their magic and the things that they don't know. One of the best performances, if not the best one is that of the lone muggle. We seem to get to experience everything through his eyes (to a certain extent). His wonderment is our wonderment. And I really enjoy the actor Eddie Redmayne, for the life of me, I can't remember his character name, but there were opportunities for him to be over the top and he never was. I sat next to someone in her 20s (I am in my 50s) and she was just over-the-moon watching the movie. I enjoyed it immensely as well. Just fantastic special effects, great storyline.. and all actors perform splendidly. This is a multiple view movie that your kids will never get tired of. It is a nice little addition to the Potter franchise. (The story takes place before Potter). I say this is a must see on the big screen.",9,31,60,17 November 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Wow, simply wow.
","I don't know how they were able to keep things so cohesive. This is, arguably, part 22 of the longest story telling in the history of film. It so good and so intricate. There isn't a moment where you are bored but to understand all that's going on, at a minimum, you should watch Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel first... but to enjoy the full maximum benefit you really should watch all the Marvel films.I'm going to keep this spoiler free because I hate spoilers and besides...no one should be reading any reviews if you are planning on seeing this. You already know what's the deal now and you are either invested or you're not.Let me just say that the CGI is just gorgeous. This is a pretty thing to watch. Bradley Cooper'S Rocket is just a brilliant piece of voice acting. Chris Evans is the ultimate hero. Not the strongest or smartest but he totally sells you on being the truest.This film is pretty emotional at points... in unexpected places for me. And it is a must see on the big screen.I just realize I didn't really review the film in the typical sort of review but I can say that there are moments in the film where the audience cheered and you didn't mind. This is the Super Bowl of super hero films. I like the way they wrapped it up. And i bet it receives a Best Picture nod. It will not win but it will be nominated. It definitely will clean up in all the technical categories.God, I'm going to miss all of this. Going to see a Marvel movie or two, every year... i can't wait to own it so I can host a marathon. Please enjoy this with your friends and family.. because in the end that's what it's all about and this film drives home that point.",10,1,4,26 April 2019
Twilight," Poorly directed movie, should have been better
","I am not here to bash Twilight because its for teen girls. I am here to write a review on a movie that should have been better. So I finally decided to see what was all the fuss about this movie. People either love it or hate it. Some people take offense that this movie exist and some people take offense to anyone doing anything but praising this movie. Well.. I am sorry but I will offend you.I think this movie was missing some true direction and the editing was really bad because the movie made some questionable leaps as if middle part of the movie was missing. There other people in the movie might as well not exist. They were basically treated as if they were an inanimate chair, which wouldn't have been bad if the leads did more than just stare. The script is horrendous. The part when she figures out that he is a vampire and they are in the woods and he just tells her to 'just say it'. Seriously? That's the biggest dramatic moment in the movie. I really couldn't tell the difference between the guy that played Edward and one of the trees in the forest. He was that wooden. They almost had a good story there with the vampires that do like to hunt humans, but they just didn't really do anything with it. And the supposedly climatic fight between the two vampires was pretty dull and it was over really quickly. The movie felt really long and really short at the same time. It didn't seem romantic at all, well maybe a little but that what its main thing suppose to be, romance. The love between the two advance so fast that if felt like a victim and her stalker. It advance with any reason what so ever and that was missing from this film. But, the movie isn't for me. I am not the movie's target audience, but I just thought it was poorly directed. The director should have required better performance out of her actors/actresses.",4,0,2,22 February 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Exasperating Slow start
","First, I think people who are 'true' fans, the D&D, Gamers are going to love this film no matter what. I love the other three, but to give you my honest opinion, this film is so slow of a start that I wanted to give up on it. I like the film, but didn't love it and I tell you why. The Dwarfs makeup were so fake looking that it played more like a Saturday Morning Puppet show than a adventure movie. And of course they come in all shape and sizes and for a minute there I thought they were rejects from a Snow White film. They sure acted like it. But the movie just trudges along at a slow pace and it's not revealing any true relevant information. Unlike the other three, when this one was over, I wasn't thinking 'wow'. I was thinking, thank god. It fees a heck of a lot longer than 3 hours, I can tell you that and a good movie should never make it seems you are spending more time in the theater than you actually have. I think true fans will love it, but I think most people will like it. Once the movie got going and the pace picked up, I thought it gotten better. But o me, it is Peter Jackson version of the Phantom Menace. Beautiful to look at, but missing that 'X' factor. It isn't magical. It is just another movie, not an adventure. It's a bit too kiddie. I can't see myself sitting in the theater and watching it again. I couldn't get past the slowness and the fake-looking characters. One last thing... beautiful set and I welcome all the familiar faces.",6,2,11,18 December 2012
The Incredibles," Pixtar ups the Ante (and then some)
","This film is simply amazing and is such a joy to watch. The animation is so fluid,colorful and so first class. Pixtar made a film which combines not only top notch animation, but a very good story and great action. At times you your jaw will hit the floor and your mind will be will with such wonderment on how well the film flows and the incredible scenes you are watching on the screen. You can tell that such care and master craftmanship went into the production of The Incredibles. Wonder voice overs are provided by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson. The film is about retire superheroes who have adjusted to their humdrum life and having to reluctantly (and not so reluctantly) come out of retirement and do the superhero thing all over again. If you are an adult, this film will turn you into a kid again. Between Dreamworks (for Shrek and Shrek2) and Pixtar (Finding Nemo, Toy Story and The Incredibles), it is now safe to take your whole family to the movies again. For your hard earned dollars I can't think of a better film to spend your money on then this one. So go see it for yourself. Take your kids, take your nieces and nephews, your grandkids, your grandparents and perhaps the family dog and go see a movie that is all of that AND a bag of chips (in this case popcorn).",Null,0,1,5 November 2004
Guardians of the Galaxy," I was amazingly surprised
","I absolutely knew NOTHING about the comic that this is based on. Friends of mine kept asking me if they did justice to such and such character. And my answer was, well, since I thought the movie was excellent, they did justice to all the characters. My biggest fear was that this was going to be too kiddie (the talking raccoon in the preview and the tree). but it wasn't. It's highly entertaining with a good plot, good characters and great pace. The special effects are amazing.. you completely forget that the tree and the raccoon are digital characters, you just accept them. This is a movie for the whole family, also a movie I think single adults males and females will enjoy. It reminds me of when I first saw Star Wars and I am not afraid to compare it to that glee I felt after wards. I think this film is deserved of multiple viewings and a must have when it released. And Chris Pratt is the perfect 'Star Lord'.. sort of like both Harrison Ford character Indiana Jones and Hans Solo wrapped up into one'.",9,0,4,6 August 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill Thrills
","Yuen Wo Ping should get half the directing credit for this movie because half the film is his remarkable choreographed fight scenes.  This is a stylish, slick, wonderfully artistically violent film.  Uma Thurman is not only amazing but believable.  Tarantino is very much aware of the importance of music and just like in his previous films I think he did in outstanding job in choosing each musical number for each scene.  Basic synopsis: Uma Thurman wants revenge on a former employer and her former coworkers who shot her up during at her wedding.  She spends the rest of that movie planning and exacting that revenge.As I said before, there are some amazing fight scenes in this film, in particular with a young 17 year old, but deadly Japanese school girl with a ball and chain.  This is Tarantino's homage to the violent Asian action films of the 70s.   Pretty much everyone knows that Quentin is a big movie buff and freak and his whole career in film making has been paying homage to the films he loved while growing up.  This guy sees the beauty of the uberviolent, smashed nose, low budget films such as Cleopatra Jones, Game of Death, Fist of Fury, The Killing Machine (Japanese its - Shinkansen daibakuha).  In fact if you ever get to see The Killing Machine you will understand much about the violence in Kill Bill.  Anyway, the fight scenes in this film are nothing short from brilliant.  My biggest detraction of this movie is that the way it ends.  It felt, very much so, that it ended in the middle.  I know Volume 2 will be released in February and I understand some aspect of splitting this film in half, but that is the problem.  Most films that have sequels attached to them are films that have a definite ending themselves.  But they were made with and ending.  Volume 1 of Kill Bill was original made to be a single picture and thus the ending for the movie is actually in Volume 2.  What we have here is a film that ends on its crest.  We only get half the plot, we only get half the character development (what little Tarantino usually have in his films).  What we get is half a movie.    I am sure that Tarantino has a final cut clause in his contract and thus ended up with a 4, probably 4 ½ hour film.  And I am sure he as willing to release it as such, but Miramax came up with the (not so) brilliant idea of releasing the film in 2 parts.  I guess in a hope of doubling its profits. I know theater chains hate 3 + hours films.  They would rather have 8 showings of a 2 hour film instead of 5 showings of films such as Braveheart or Gladiator.  They make more money during the day by faster turnover rates. So they WILL NOT support a 4 hour film.  3 ½ hours is as a far as they are willing to go, heck they barely support 3 hour films. Now when a director wants to tell a story and it takes 4 hours to tell the only way we get the whole story is through director's cut DVDs (for example The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, 1st two parts added an additional 30 minutes each, it was the same way with Cameron's Aliens).   There is only one POSTIVE light in this whole 2 part nonsense and that is that part 2 is being released in February and not a year later (as in Lord of the Rings).  Will they release the film on one single DVD?  I doubt it, where is the profit in that?  Anyway, I give KILL BILL an A.  I liked it and Quentin Tarantino along with fight choreographers Yuen Wo Ping and Sonny Chiba not only delivers a highly entertaining film but a highly memorable one to boot.",10,0,1,11 October 2003
Black Snake Moan," Sam L. Gives a Tour De Force Performance
","I went to the theater, intending on seeing the 300. But it started to late and I wanted to have dinner first. So me and my buddy settle on Black Snake Moan. Now the movie started off a bit shaky for me and to tell you quite honestly, I had no idea what the movie was going to be about. All I knew it started Sam L Jackson and Christina Ricci, two actors I admire in past movies. The film takes place in an unnamed hard-times town in the south somewhere. Sam L is going through some stuff separately from Christina Ricci. Fate brings them together and the movie really takes off. You don't know if he is crazy, but you definitely know that she is. The poster gives you no hint on what happens next. Sam L amazed me with all of his abilities. And there is a scene that is definitive to the movie and I don't want to say, but you know it when you see it (and here it). Special movies have those scenes (i.e. Harrison Ford's gun play in Raiders, Holly Hunter dance scene in Living Out Loud, Brad Pitt scene at the end of Seven, Uma 88 scene in Kill Bill Pt1). Some movies just have those definitive moments which makes the movie great and this memorable scene, lets just say it involves a storm, will transfix you. I didn't think I would like the movie and I ended up loving it. This is, by far, Sam L Jackson best performance to date! Even better than his bible verse quoting Jules in Pulp Fiction. And to tell you quite frankly, the man needs to do more work like this and less films like The Man or Deep Blue. Samuel L Jackson can act and he GROWLS in this film. And I didn't even mention the fantastic job that Christina Ricci does. But, by far, Sam L is the star of the pic.",9,1,4,25 March 2007
The Dark Knight," Heath Ledger makes you forget Jack ever played Joker!
","This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted 'Dark Knight'. We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight.",10,23,48,20 July 2008
Grindhouse," Two Films, One Glorious Guilty Pleasure Experience
","There was one image, above all, that made me want to see this film, Rose McGowan and her assault weapon leg. Now Grindhouse films have been back already (Wolf Creek, Tourista, High Tension, etc). So Tarantino and Rodriquez set up to honor the fabulous Z films of the 60's and 70's and they honor those films well. It starts out with Planet Terror which is about a town turning into zombies by the release of a mysterious gas from a nearby army base. The film is fast pace, action pack and so over the top gleeful that you sit smiling the entire time and trust me, there are some just shocking moments that you can't help but react. Freddy Rodriquez (from Six Feet Under) is fantastic in this film and Robert R does not pull any punches. His half of Grindhouse is outstanding from beginning to end. Next we have Death Proof, Tarantino's half. Its a bit slow at the beginning because you just want to get to the action. I think the purpose of all this setup is so you can care for the characters. Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike, a drifter/outsider with one heck of a car. Now this isn't giving anything away. He seems nice but he turns, oh how he turns. This is in tribute to those films where you meet a very helpful nice stranger and take there offer and you end of regretting it through the rest of the film. Overall I give this film an 8 out of 10. Tarantino film is a bit of a letdown after planet terror (until the end of Tarantino's film). The movie also feature at least two fake trailers done by other directors, friends of Rodriquez and Tarantino and I can tellyou, if they WERE actual films, I would see them. Grindhouse films were those made by second-tier directors who were outside of Hollywood and just had a camera some friends and a little money. Is this film art, no way, but it sure is enjoyable and I can tell you, IT IS NOT, I repeat, NOT for everyone. DO NOT TAKE ANY CHILDREN TO THIS FILM. I cannot stressed this enough. Now if you are under 17... and you can't get in... you may have to do some parental negotiation. I say that, at the very least, you have to be in highschool to see this film. Anyone under 15 have to wait. I mean, it's not even appropriate for adults with certain sensibilities. And for you men out there, know your wives and girlfriends before taking them. Otherwise you will have to profusely apologize and may have to take them to the next 10 chick flicks. But if you must take them, the price to pay is soooo worth it. Zombies, weapon legs, nudity, disgusting images.. all worth it.",8,3,8,7 April 2007
In Time," Eh, worth the rental
","Cool concept of a movie and Timberlake is pretty good in it, but the dialog is clunky at best and there isn't any chemistry between the co- star. Justin lives in the ghetto, Amanda lives in upper society. The only currency is time itself. Having time, keeps you alive. They never explain how people are engineer that their lives are measure by a timer, it just is. With everything you do, you have to pay for it in giving up time on your life. You can get time back by borrowing it, stealing it, or being super rich. Rich guys comes into the ghetto, tired of living, he gives all his time (a century) to Timberlake. Justin, having all the time in the world, goes to see where the rich lives. He meets Amanda and bada bing, they are being chase. The whole premise of the movie is based on people running out of time and controlling time Like I said, good concept, but not so good execution. It just flat in a lot of places, A LOT. Amanda isn't ask to do a whole lot and she doesn't to include deliver her lines with any convictions. The movie should be called 'Justin Timberlake gets chased' Because is on him 90% of the time. Everyone else is just cardboard background people, to include the guy playing Amanda's dad and the cop that chases Justin. And the end of the movie is so anti-climatic and boring and it makes no real sense. Still, if you must see it, Rent it from Redbox for a dollar or wait for it on Netflix or HBO.",5,0,1,1 March 2012
The Happening," The Crappening
","So this is M Night's first R rated film and it's much ado about nothing. I normally like his films, The Sixth Sense, Signs, and even Unbreakable, but for me, his last three movies (The Village, Lady in Water and now the Happening) have been HUGE disappointments. In this film you follow along with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel as an unknown virus is striking the US. No one knows what it is and after awhile, you will not care what it is. This movie is so slow and boring and all it does is pose. I swear I thought I was in a staring contest and lost after 2 hours. A whole lot of nothing happens in this film. M Night doesn't bring the audience in along for the ride. It feels as if its one of those movie that we are suppose to marvel in his brilliant use of subtlety, but its all subtleness. You sit through it and it just feels so pretentious that you feel like eating your own arms just for something to do. It is a one note film. It is the bad karaoke of film making and for his first 'R' rated film, it is completely devoid of danger, excitement, of fear. He basically told a story that has no beginning, no end, just a middle and when you find out the possible cause of The Crappening.. I mean the Happening you will roll your eyes and question it... i mean really? really? thats it, really? M Night next film better knock it out of the park or people will not go see his films anymore. A suggestion to M Night. How about trying you hand of just directing and leaving the writing to someone else. You are not Alfred Hitchcock because you can't just have suspense without the threat. With going to a film costing more and so many good films this year that DID knock it out of the park, the Happening is such a big let down. And, if you all are like me, you really are pulling for M. Night. But you have to call it like you see it. Nothing happens in the Happening. Sorry.",3,3,7,17 July 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Where is the heart?
","A while ago, I written a review on this movie when I saw it in the theater. Now that it's available for DVD I would like to revise a few things.  As I was trying to watch it, I kept blinking out.  No matter how hard I concentrated and how much I wanted to watch the movie, it just couldn't hold my interest and I now know why.  The movie is lifeless.  It has no soul.  I compare it to watching your best friend play someone else on a video game and you are observing.  Sure it's fun to them and for you it's semi-interesting, but after awhile you become bored with it because it doesn't involve you.  The Matrix Reloaded doesn't bring it audience in with it.  It doesn't seem like it is interested in presenting characters that you care about.  Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and even Agent Smith are just cardboard cutout of their previous self from the previous movie.  Morpheus and Neo have become deities (for lack of a better word) and Trinity is there in order to give Neo a purpose, but she doesn't do much.  Zion, the last free city, doesn't seem like a city worth fighting for.  It's more like an elaborate cave dwelling. But the one thing that stands out like a scab is the obvious looking fake scenes.  Everything is so obvious CGI.  At least the first film final battle seemed as if there was some serious since of urgency and danger.  But this one hits you with so many stunts and CGI effects that after awhile, it becomes dull.  I still give it props on what it is TRYING to achieve, but I have to toned down my earlier glowing remarks.  Hopefully Revolutions can wrap things us for us and make this film a better film.  I know it's a better film, but until Revolution comes out, the trees indeed are blocking the forest.",Null,0,0,25 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Plot slacking (who cares) eyeball popping special FX entertains!
","Well since the surprisingly huge hit of the Matrix which seems to define a new generation of movie goers, all anyone can talk about is when the next sequel arrives.  It finally has arrive and I saw it on it's opening night and you can tell right off the bat that they spend a lot of money on it. Plus there are many actors/actresses, non-actors (such as Roy Jones Jr.) trying to get involve in the phenomenon.  A brief synopsis.  The Matrix Reloaded fine our hero Neo finally making it to Zion.   Him and Trinity (Moss) are now a bonafide item.  Our ubercaptain, Morpheus arrives in Zion like a prophet except not everyone believes in his vision, especially not his boss.  His boss believes in that sheer might and numbers will be the machines as Morpheus still believes that Neo is the one.  Meanwhile, our coolest villain since Darth Vader, perfect diction Agent Smith, finds himself new life, and just as the Beatles did, he decided to try a little help with his friends to get back at Neo.   Of course his friends are himself, and himself, and himself... so on and so on.
This movie has a heck of a lot of action and I do mean a ton of it. Some very expensive CGI effect, but, event though I hate to admit it, it does lack on plot.  I did think they overused the slow-motion camera a bit too much.  It seemed that practically every action scene had it in it.  A little something I like to call.. Matrix mode.  Needless to say I was still blow away by the stunts that I saw, particularly a highway chase that even John Frankenheimer(Ronin) and William Friedkin (French Connection)  would have liked (even though it was CGI'ed).  Keanu is still Mr.. wood when it comes to acting and if they ever make a movie about the life and times of Al Gore, I am sure Mr.. expressionless one can play Mr.. expressionless two.  But, for the Matrix Reloaded you really don't need the Oscar winning caliber performance.  All you need is a cardboard guy to give you a few whoa's here and there and Keanu fits perfectly in here.  Overall this is a gleeful, butter-popcorn munching, goobers eating big screen bonanza that did it's job of bringing entertainment from Hollywood to the audience at the megaplex and isn't that what's it all about.  Entertaining the masses.  Can't wait to see Matrix Revolutions and see more stuff get blown up in Matrix mode.  Film gets a B.",Null,0,0,8 June 2003
The Fountain," Misleading preview has it as a total different movie
","This movie is COMPLETELY different then how the preview portrays the film. The preview makes you believe that this film is about the legendary fountain of youth, the tree of life and back during the Spanish Inquisition days a conquistador finds and an lives on and on... but nooooooooo... First, I pick this film out to watch with other people and this is a film that either you watch alone (first) or you watch with people who have opened minds. I show have known better because it is a film by Darrin Aronosky (directed Pi and Requiem For a Dream, both excellent films). The reason I say you watch with people with open minds, because you have to be ready to watch a film like this. The film is very poetic and surreal. You aren't exactly sure what you are watching. You aren't exactly sure what is real and what isn't real. In fact when its over, there are several different interpretations of what you've seen. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. And that is all I am going to say because by telling you what happens, gives away too much and things have to open for you on its on. I will say this, it reminds me of What Dreams May Come, mixed with Jacob's Ladder. Here are some question this film brings up for me. Do you want to live forever? What would you do if you could? How do you let someone go? What would drive you crazy? I gave this film a 7 out of 10 because the film is visually S-T-U-N-N-I-N-G!! And what else I like about the film is that its not obvious and it ABSOLUTELY requires a second view. The first view asks questions, the second view may answer those questions. I like that. Good luck with this one and be ready for something COMPLETELY different.",7,1,2,8 July 2007
Mystic River," Mystic River the Shakespearean tragedy
","I saw this movie a while ago and just now, while thinking about it, it reminds me of so many of Shakespeare's tragedies. Something bad happens to someone and they become a victim. That victim grows up and something worse happens and now the victim is the suspect but no one knows the true heroic deeds and nature of the once victim until its too late.The film stars Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. They were childhood friends and something horrific happens and the grow up and grown apart. Years later, as adults, they all have different roles. Sean Penn is now the neighborhood go to guy who is a little shady but nothing to serious. Yet everyone knows that he is the guy you can rely on to solve neighborhood disputes. Tim Robbins is now the strange guy that people avoid but are cordial to when they see him on the streets. No one wants to talk to him (as he was once a victim himself as a child). He is married to Marcia Gay Harden who loves him (but not unconditionally) and is a little unease by him. Kevin Bacon is now a detective and has been completely removed from the scene, but an event happens that brings him back in touch with his old childhood friends.So tragedy strikes and it becomes a race between street justice and official justice. People become short-tempered. They want to know, right now who did it. They do not want to wait for an official investigation so they start their own. The problem with street justice is that it doesn't require any evidence, just suspicion and like all Shakespearean tragedies a little bit of information becomes an extremely dangerous thing. Lots of little things play out, like the disloyalty of one wife, another wife egging her husband on ala Lady McBeth. Daughters not permitting to date into certain families ala Romeo and Juliet. And in the end, everyone change and none of it for the better. Jealousy is a hungry goddess and in this film, it is feed a lot and is the main culprit. Plus it's interesting on how the mind would take a single nugget of info and totally self-destruct and turn something that isn't true, into fact. And once your mind is set to that something is a fact then the truth sounds like a lie.This is a film worthy to watch and it leads to discussion. The film is dark; there is no joy in it, but its great to see how things can spiral out of control. Tragedy muddles the mind and everyone's mind is muddle in this film. I give this film a 7 out of 10. You have seen this before, although this film does a great job of it, but it's not a film that will amaze you. And 7 is a great rating for a simple drama.",7,1,2,2 February 2008
Whiplash," 10 out of 10 out of 10 out of 10.. this movie is that excellent
","I've seen the other nominated Best Picture and I genuinely like them, but to me, this is by far the Best Picture of the year. Great writing, great acting, great directing, fantastic editing and amazing music. J.K. Simmons is an amazing actor. I remember him on OZ and boy did he blow the performance out the water... And you know what, Miles Teller met him step for step. This film is about obsession. Obsession of Mile Teller to be the best and Obsession of JK Simmons to never settle. The film centers around Miles as he is studying at a music conservatory. He is picked to be part of the best jazz ensemble in the school. But soon he realizes that the guy he admires is the toughest and most demanding person he has ever met. And you sit on the edge of your seat with each scene, ESPECIALLY when they are in it together. I wish I can tell you how its all going to play out, but I can't. I want you to enjoy each morsel, each moment that happens. I knew I wanted to see this movie once I saw the preview and heard part of the music. If you a fan of jazz, this is a must own. But music fan or not, this is a must watch.",10,2,5,1 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas hits the game winning shot!
","My goodness! I was not impressed with Episode I with the performances and it's lack of threat. I was more impressed with Episode II, although I thought Hayden Christiansan was wooden to the core. But everyone comes wonderfully together in Episode III. I compare it to a Michael Jordan championship game winning shot at the buzzer. Hayden is much much improve so much so that his internal struggles seem genuine. The execution of the story, from the scrolling beginning credits to the end credits is worthwhile to the point that this movie makes Episode I and II BETTER! You have lots of Stromtroopers, who are a welcome site after the first one. I wanted to see more Jedi battles, but I understand why Lucas made it the way that he did. I was impressed with the Jedi fight between Anakin (now Darth) and Obi-Wan, and even though you know the outcome, it still nice to SEE it. After all, all three stories are about how Darth became Darth. Sure this movie is the darkest of all six film, but that is what sets it apart. For me, although Episode IV: A New Hope has a special place in my heart, this one, Revenge of the Sith is the second best, just behind Empire Strikes Back (funny, the best 2 star wars film is when evil is at its most wicked). And the cool thing is that this film answers all questions on why the characters in Episode IV, A New Hope behave and interact with each other they way they do. Bravo to all the performances in this film, to the well film and well scripted story and to the dazzling CGI effects that dwarfs my imagination. Thanks George for taking us on that journey, long ago, in a galaxy far far away.",8,1,4,24 May 2005
Wonder Woman," Wonderful Wonder Woman
","I cannot tell you how glad that this movie lived up to the hype. I was so severely disappointed with Batman v Superman except the Wonder Woman part. So I was a bit worried but this is a runaway hit. Gal Gadot commands the title character and thank god because I know there were people who were surprised at her casting. The director allowed her to be the heroine and not just as another capable woman being rescued by some guy. She comes off as powerful. The movie is exciting. The pace is great. I was also worried that it would feel dated like the first Captain America being as the setting was during WW1. But it felt fresh while holding onto the WW1 setting. The movie focuses on Gal Gadot and never distracts with side characters like the previous movie this character was in (Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice). In the end, you didn't want it to end and that is about as high a praise you can say about a movie. I wanted more. If I was going to rate it among the DC movie, its a very very close second to The Dark Knight, because the Dark Knight had a great villain. But no one has a better hero of all the DC movies than this one.",10,16,32,1 June 2017
Godzilla," Godzilla. Good enough
","I'm a fan of Gozilla movies. And this was way better than the Matthew Broderick one. But being a fan this is a straight forward Godzilla movie with better CGI. It wasn't mind blowing so it's no as 10, but it was satisfying. And I'm not going to include any spoilers but seriously it's impossible to spoil a Godziila movie. Giant lizard + mankind. Shake and watch stuff get destroyed. Some issues: I thought they took to long setting up the movie. And a slight issue with the creature design. And as I said the story was straight forward. And we didn't get enough of Godzilla's fire breathe because when they did show it, it was great. The movie feature some talented actors and actresses but this movie really didn't need THAT much acting. Fun to see the dude from Kick A in another movie. But regardless of who is in it, it is entertaining and that's all that counts with this type of movie. I say a must see on the big screen.",7,1,3,18 May 2014
Her," I seriously don't know what to think
","I like Spike Jonze movies and because I like Being John Malkovich, I decided to give this a shot. To tell you quite honestly, I had no real desire to see it because of the absurdity of the plot. So after watching it, I'm glad I did. Is it a second viewing? Probably not. An extremely lonely guy buys this new 'SIRI-like' operating system. Apparently the computers in the near future are all voice base. So the OS is a learning one and he is asked a series of question and then 'Samatha' is created. He is fascinated at the technology of the thing as it learns about him and his surroundings.. He finally finds something that really understands him. So when I think about this movie, I think about all those folks who have online relationships only and I find it no real difference since both seems similar. And then I got it. He has someone (something) in his life that doesn't challenge and criticizes him and some people need that. The movie is thought provoking because you think.. this is crazy.. but there was an interesting scene, when he looks around and seeing everyone is completely engage with their devices. And aren't we there now? So I think the story is well developed. I like all the music selection. Joaquim comes off as a sympathetic figure which could be viewed as creepy. And it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. Great casting to.. It was a nice surprise to see Amy Adams in this film.",8,0,1,6 August 2014
Valkyrie," Unfortunately Boring
","Now I go into this movie knowing a lot about this particular attempt on Hitler's life and no one is going to be surprise about how this movie is going to play out if you know history. I mean, after all, this is not a 'what if' movie.To me, this movie took forever to get going. It is extremely slow pace and that may sit well with others, but you expected to have a bit more meat than it had. But I guess this movie wanted to show you how much commitment that these guys had. Unfortunately this movie really centers around Tom Cruise's character and waste so much talent of the other cast members (Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard). It is in interesting story but the movie didn't make it so. This movie feels a lot longer than its 2 hour running time and unfortunately I think Universal has a big dude on their hands. For people who are going to think they are going to see a WW2 film, save your money, it's not that type of movie. And I knew what I was getting into, but unfortunately this movie did not entertain and thats should be the number one priority of any movie. It just didn't keep my interest. It looks good, it sounds good, but it just misses the mark. I give it a 6 out of 10 and I think I am being generous by one mark. But it gets that score because of the last 15-20 minutes.",6,4,12,1 January 2009
The Island," I actually like this Logan's Run wannabe
","Lets not kid ourselves. We have all seen this before. The future where all is cool, but not so cool. But you know what, it doesn't stop it for being fun to see it again. This time around Michael Bay gives us the Island, a film about 90 percent Logan's Run and 10 Percent the Running Man. It's the future and all are perfect and all are kind of stupid. Everyone acts the same, think the same and even dress the same. It's a perfect utopian society. Everyday the inhabitants are entered into a contest (well practically every day), where they can win a permanent vacation to paradise. They all want it. But, one gets to see whats behind the wizard's curtain...This is what Michael Bay does best. He combines CGI with fast camera movements and familiar faces. He is trying to entertain us. He isn't trying to give us the best story, what he is trying to do is give us a good time at the movies. I think he does it. Ewan McGregor is a fun actor to watch and no matter what the role is, you know he believes in it. He does a really good job here in the role he is given. Scarlett Johannson (sp?) is inconsequence, but she is use as a motivating tool to put our main star in action. Normally, in this type of films, the female character doesn't get a whole lot to do but be in peril. They may give them one good fight scene (or love scene) and that is about it. Think of Michael Bay other films (Armageddon, The Rock, Pearl Harbor to name a few) and just think how really important were the females in those films. Nevertheless, its how Hollywood wants their action films and so with The Island, we get the same formula we always get from Hollywood, but in a faster, prettier picture. The CGI stunts look awesome and it was a popcorn eating fun picture. I think the critics may have been expecting THX-1138. Oh well, I recommend seeing this film as a matinée.",7,0,1,9 August 2005
