Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Atrocious - George Lucas Should Be Forced Into Retirement
","This movie is atrocious. I'm watching it right now and thought I would take this commercial break to say how awful it is. Like thousands of other people I went to see it at the theatre when it first came out. I waited in line and the theatre was packed and there was so much excitement which turned to shock at how bad it was. Have you ever heard five hundred people groan all at once? I have, at this movie. Every time Jar Jar Binks was on screen doing his pathetic 'comic relief'. Every time that useless kid tried to act, and every time a fourth-grade level line of dialog was delivered. GROAN! Then everyone just got angry that this movie with such high hopes and with so many years of thought put into it was allowed to suck so completely. I hoped that it was just a 'horrible by comparison' thing and that when I finally watched it again (today) it might not suck so much but no such luck. This movie sucks, completely, totally sucks. Avoid at all costs, it has ruined the entire Star Wars franchise for me. I'll still give the other two prequels another try but I'm guessing the second movie will also still completely blow and Revenge of the Sith will still be an okay film but not nearly as good as the first three.",Null,3,5,13 August 2008
