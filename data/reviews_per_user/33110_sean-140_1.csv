Gremlins," exciting, compelling and touching
","Very compelling, an extremely touching ending with a great speech from the old Chinese man and touching speech about why Phoebe Cates doesn't like Christmas.  Plenty of black humour to enjoy from the gremlins themselves and the old lady flying out of window.  Character development for some of the characters not great but can be overlooked.  Overall 10/10",10,0,1,19 September 2001
