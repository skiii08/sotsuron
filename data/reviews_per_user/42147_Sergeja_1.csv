Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Film is a great joke about USA and not about Kasahstan
","My boss in Germany told me that American people don't even understand that the film is about USA and all west countries and not about Kasahstan .I could not believe him, but now I see he is right.That's a greatest Joke of that film that millions of American people don't even understand that the whole film (100%) is the satire to American way of life and US people,Kasahstan is only alias for some country of '2-3 word':The main joke is that US people really think there in KAsahstan or some where else lives some 'idiots'.But now the whole world see were the most crazy people lives: in the US and A.And it is not funny !",10,1,38,25 December 2006
