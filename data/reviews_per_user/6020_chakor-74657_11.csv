Men in Black 3," A Great Time Travel Story and a Worthy Sequel
","Men in Black 3 has to be one of my top 5 favorite films of all time, along with the first Men in Black and a few others. With the five year anniversary of Men in Black 3 coming up, I figured that this would be a good time to finally write my review for it.The basic plot of the film involves a villain from the past who comes back for revenge on Agent K. Boris the Animal, played by Jemaine Clement, escapes from Lunarmax prison and goes back in time to July 16, 1969 to kill Agent K. With the timeline altered, the Boglodites begin a full scale invasion of Earth, and Agent J has to go back in time to save his partner. As much as I love Jemaine Clement's portrayal of Boris, the best part of the film has to be Josh Brolin as the young Agent K. He's near spot-on identical to Tommy Lee Jones in terms of voice, impression, and appearance. When I first saw the film, I was highly convinced that a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones went forward in time under the name 'Josh Brolin' specifically so that he could play this part in the film. Needless to say, the chemistry between Agent J and the young Agent K is pulled off very well.As the two agents follow clues, they run into Griffin the Archanan (played by Michael Stuhlbarg), an alien capable of seeing all possible timelines at once. Griffin ends up giving the two agents the ArcNet defense system, which is a shield capable of protecting the Earth from the Boglodite invasion. It turns out that the ArcNet needs to be attached to the Apollo 11 rocket, which is a part of the story that I found very creative. There is also a very emotional part at the ending that I won't spoil.While it has its fair share of plot holes (what time travel films don't?) and it's not the greatest film in the whole world, Men in Black 3 most definitely succeeds where Men in Black II failed, and it is a more than worthy sequel to the original. If you're a fan of the franchise and haven't seen the film yet, or if you're just into alien and time travel stories, you need to see Men in Black 3. You don't know what you're missing.",9,1,3,15 April 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Could Have Been Good, But Ended Up Boring and Forgettable
","When I heard that this film was basically another prequel and not just an bland retread like The Force Awakens, I was actually somewhat looking forward to it and thought it would be a good home viewing - boy was I wrong. Long story short - a lot happens in Rogue One, but almost none of it really means anything because it has almost no substance. The idea on paper was still good and the Vader scenes were well done, but other than those two scenes, the entire film is horribly bland and completely forgettable. The characters are about as cardboard as they come and have almost zero character development. There are only three characters in the entire film who I found myself giving an iota for as I watched it, and those were the droid (can't remember its name), Jyn, and Galen - and even all three of them weren't given enough development; they were just better than the other characters. The score is also unbelievably 'bleh' and does not help the film at all. I have heard other reviews argue that this film is 'deep' - yeah, maybe for a 13-year-old. But for someone simply looking for a good film, there is no substance and it feels like a two-hour waste of time. It is so boring that it is almost the perfect opposite of entertainment.So, at the end of the day, this is yet another fine example of how to sell a film with its name. If this film didn't have the Star Wars name on it, its Rotten Tomatoes score would be incredibly low and I doubt it's IMDb consensus would be a 7.9/10. Normally I would rate this about a 3/10, but considering how high the current IMDb consensus is, all it's getting is a 1/10.",1,2,6,13 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Surreal
","The Good: Visually I loved pretty much everything about it (minus some of the Sakaar scenes). The film certainly has its moments, and I loved the overall storyline when it was properly used (which isn't very often, I'll talk about this more in 'The Bad' section). All of the cast are very solid in their roles even if they are a bit annoying at times (Grandmaster I found particularly annoying). Most of the action sequences are well done and easily some of the best parts of the film. My favorite scenes of the entire film are the scenes when Hela kills the Asgardian soldiers, Hela explains her backstory, and the scene where she resurrects the dead soldiers and Fenris with the Eternal Flame.She was actually my favorite part of the film. She has plenty of good action sequences, is tons of fun to see on screen, has a passable amount of screen time, and has some decent dialogue when it isn't hindered by the comic relief. However, the only things that really make her a step above most of Marvel's past bland villain offerings are the performance, visuals, and of course the fun factor. Hela is essentially to this film what Tim Curry's Pennywise was to the 90's IT miniseries. Loki is easily my second favorite part of the film as he is still a great character and we've gone for far too long without seeing him on the big screen.The Bad: This is one of those movies where they show you a lot of good story elements but never fully utilize them - ever. To me it almost feels like an attempt by the studio to troll the audience by saying 'Hey, we know we can do this, but we won't anyway and instead we'll substitute it for comic relief or pretend it didn't happen'. I can't tell if the writing was originally this lazy or if it just turned out that way because of the humor. I didn't feel that any of the characters had their backstories explored to their full potential. Grandmaster was by far the most underused as we only get these vague hints as to his origin. Hela's backstory is ironically the most fully-explained albeit still not fully utilized. Skurge was a joke.And of course, now we get to that part. Albeit overused in the MCU's past, humor has never been something that fully hindered by ability to enjoy any of their movies. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. The opening scene with Thor and Surtur pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film from start to finish. The final battle is by far the weakest part of the film, both due to the nonstop one-liners and the fact that very little emphasis is actually put on the coming of Ragnarok until near the end of the battle. I wanted there to be some humor in this, but not American Werewolf in London-level humor where I just can't stomach stake and ice cream on the same plate.Conclusion: Overall it was an enjoyable watch and I'm certainly glad I went to see it. However, despite its moments, I can't help but feel that the film was a massive waste of potential on so many levels. They show you so many glimpses of really good stuff, but whenever you think they'll use it, they don't. Thor (2011) is by far the superior film in my book, although this is still far better than The Dark World where the entertainment factor is concerned.On my first viewing I'd give it a solid 6/10. I may very well be coming off more negative than I really mean to sound and I might be a bit too harsh. I desperately wanted to like this more when walking out of the theatre, but I simply cannot bring myself to. If the rumor is true that they made this a full-blown comedy to make the 'impact' of Infinity War greater, then it is truly a shame that they had to sacrifice the quality of what could have been one of the best MCU installments in exchange for something else. Who knows, I may change my mind on a second viewing. Post credits scenes are nothing worth staying for this time around.",1,2,6,3 November 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Dismal, tedious, overstuffed, and unearned crossover
","Let me first start off by saying that my view on this film is a bit biased because I never liked the idea of a Winter Solider sequel and the Avengers Civil War being one film to begin with. I do find it very ironic that this film released the same year as Batman v. Superman because both films shared very similar if not practically identical flaws - yet one was properly negatively received whilst the other got much high praise that I still do not understand. Let's look at the flaws both films share and then I'll talk about the other reasons as to why I didn't like CW.Unnecessary villains - Isn't the theme of BvS and CW supposed to be heroes vs. heroes, as in a conflict strictly between the heroes? If so, then why do both movies more or less ruin that premise by adding in unnecessary and ultimately worthless villains like Lex and Zemo? The latter had a good character arc and good motivations for wanting to drive the Avengers apart, but it just doesn't work when the whole theme is supposed to be heroes vs. heroes.Spent too much time setting up other films - Much like Age of Ultron, I found that this film mostly set up events for the remaining Phase Three movies more than it actually focused on the story at hand. We have Spider-Man thrown into the mix for no reason other than setting up Homecoming, whilst BvS had Wonder Woman thrown in for no reason along with a bunch of Justice League teasers. Black Panther's arc in CW is great and feels relevant to the story, but he doesn't get enough time which is a shame because he is easily the best part of the entire film.Tedious and depressing - I personally found both films extremely dragged-out and lacking in the entertainment factor, which is even more surprising with CW because Marvel at their worst are usually entertaining. This film, on the other hand, consists mainly of tedious and boring lectures from Ross and its atmosphere is often dismal such as Tony's visit to the Raft. There are a few scenes here and there that feel more in the spirit of your average Marvel movie, such as the airport battle - but directly after that, it's back to being boring and depressing.Faux character development - Both films try to fool you into believing that their long running times are necessary for character development, which would work if those 2 and 1/2 hour running times consisted mainly of development - but they don't. The big difference between the two is that CW has actually convinced itself of its own lie and genuinely believes that its contributing to development. A good example of this would be the first scene with Wanda and Vision - the movie wants you to believe that this scene is developing these two characters and providing you with the reason as to why they fall in love, but in reality it is just pointless filler.In addition to those flaws shared between BvS and CW, my main reason for not liking CW is that I feel like this film should have never been titled 'Captain America' unless it was actually going to be a proper Steve Rogers standalone like Joe Johnston's underrated First Avenger and the excellent Winter Soldier. Instead this film is basically Avengers 3 but without Thor and Hulk. If it had been titled 'Avengers' then maybe I would be less harsh on it, but as is I feel cheated by it. Tony Stark is at his least likable in this film; tied only with Iron Man 2 for the worst portrayal of his character in the MCU. And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, we get cheated out of multiple battles. Crossbones gets killed off within the first 20 minutes or so and the other Winter Soldiers created by HYDRA are killed by Zemo, and both of these are huge middle fingers to the audience masquerading as clever plot twists.On top of all of that, the film pretty much ends just the way it began. Yes Rhodes had a minor injury, T'Chaka was killed, and Zemo was locked up, but it ended with Steve Rogers agreeing that the Avengers would come back when they were needed - totally defeating the purpose of Civil War.All in all this was pretty much a WWE Raw episode with superheroes and an unearned, unworthy, overstuffed sequel that couldn't decide whether or not it wanted to be a Winter Soldier follow up or the Avengers Civil War. As someone who mostly enjoys the MCU, this film is at the bottom three of my list and it is only worth watching on repeat viewings for Boseman's excellent Black Panther IMO... and Stan Lee's cameo which was admittedly hilarious.",4,3,4,30 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Finally another triumph for Marvel
","As someone who mostly enjoys the MCU, Phase Three has been really hit or miss for me. On one hand I loved Black Panther along with this film, but was very disappointed by the dismal Civil War which hardly brought anything new to the table and I absolutely loathed the nonstop comedy and horrible character writing for the main villain in Thor: Ragnarok. You can imagine I was a little cautious about this film, but it managed to exceed my expectations.First and foremost, I would like to thank the directors/writers for finally bringing another great villain to the table. Unlike the majority of Marvel villains who are just evil for the sole purpose of being evil and are mostly carbon copies of Loki (cough, Hela, cough), Thanos is actually a great character who not only has motivations but is a villain who you can root for at times. And at the end, he actually wins.I was also impressed by how the Russos handled the comedy in this film - so much better than the God-awful Ragnarok which was practically destroyed by its own comedy. Here the Russos not only knew how to use humor but they also knew when to tone it down. Most of it came naturally by nature of the situation and wasn't just one-liners thrown in for the sake of one-liners.Thor's arc in this film is exactly how he should have been handled in Ragnarok and his banter between Rocket and Groot was great. His arrival in the Wakanda battle was perfect and they did a great job establishing his motivations for wanting revenge against Thanos. Doctor Strange also had some great action scenes here and he was so much more memorable in Infinity War than in his own movie.From a narrative standpoint, I can understand how this movie would be considered a failure among nonfans/critics because the film doesn't really get enough room to breath when it comes to characters like the 'Secret Avengers' (Cap, Widow, Falcon, Bucky, etc.), but given how much Civil War made me not care for them and given how bland most of them are (save for Cap who I hope gets more moments to shine in Endgame), I wasn't disappointed by that. Thor and the Guardians had enough time and those characters were part of the main plot points here. The entire Outrider battle in Wakanda was just as chaotic and eyesore-inducing as your average Bayformers film, but thankfully it got much better once Thor arrived. Otherwise the only thing I was a bit disappointed by was that the Black Order were honestly lame villains that might as well have been disposable canon fodder aside from Ebony Maw who had some really cool scenes.Overall just really well done, and unlike Age of Ultron and Civil War which were mostly soulless 'Avengers Junior' episodes that began the way they ended, this movie actually leaves you feeling like there was a real consequence at the end. While I have concerns for Endgame, I am just happy that I can add Infinity War to my top 5 favorite MCU installments.",8,0,1,30 December 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A return to form for the Pirates series
","Let me first start off by saying that the first two Pirates movies are the air that I need to live and breath - they are the Star Wars and Empire of my generation, so my view on this film is going to be a bit bias. As a big fan I wanted to like this film but at the same time I never went into it with high expectations - and I kid you not, it is up there in my list of top 5 movies that I enjoyed the heck out of in a theatre. I am rather surprised by the amount if negative critical reception this got, and I could not disagree more about it being bland because I honestly found it rather refreshing in an age where it seems like Marvel and Star Wars are the only films that matter and the only ones that people like.Let's start out with what I liked:Captain Salazar was a really well-done villain by Javier Bardem and definitely my favorite part of the film. Just this character alone makes this movie a win IMO. Loved his performance and Spanish accent even if he was hamming it up a little bit here and there. The CGI for his weightless hair was also probably some of the best in the series since Davy Jones. It was also impressive how they managed to completely digitally erase the right side of his head, which was often covered up by the hair. Him and his crew being brought back to human form during the third act was predictable as hell and his demise was rather silly (as was the entire final battle), but he was definitely leagues better than Blackbeard and made for a memorable villain. Also unlike Blackbeard he had a really strong connection to Jack which made his character work well. As much as I loved the film for what it was, I really feel like it would have benefited tremendously from seeing more of Salazar as opposed to Henry, Carina, and the nonsensical Trident of Poseidon business which I'll talk about later.I really liked most of the visual gags and thought they were very well-choreographed.  You can see the whole bank heist thing coming from a mile away, but it was still hilarious. The battle between the Silent Mary, Salazar's ghost ship, and the Black Pearl was also pretty good, especially the one part where Jack using one of the Mary's canons to destroy the figurehead come to life.While some of the score was just remixes of soundtracks from CotBP and the other films, there were some really good tracks here and there. I especially loved Salazar's theme which took me by surprise and sent chills down my spine when it unexpectedly started playing about midway through the end credits. While it was directly remixed from CotBP, I also loved the track that played after the big final battle when we see the lighthouse from the beginning for the second time. I darn near teared up.Jack was sort of a positive and a negative at the same time. Depp definitely seemed like he was enjoying it more this time around (whereas in OST he was totally phoning it in and looked bored), although I think they somewhat missed the mark on the character himself. That whole flashback scene detailing the story of Jack and Salazar was very well done and definitely gave us classic Jack Sparrow in all his witty glory, but in the present day during the main story here he seemed like too much of a buffoon who couldn't do anything right and he had no standout moment where he planned out an escape or whatever, which is something that almost all of the previous films had.Now here come the negatives. Most of these didn't hinder my ability to enjoy the film, but they are definitely worth bringing up:In terms of writing - and this is probably what bugged me most - I was actually surprised by how much stuff they seemed to neglect from the previous films and expected fans of the series to ignore. I could go on forever, but things like Will Turner being cursed to captain the Flying Dutchman when the rules in DMC and AWE established that Jones was only cursed because he neglected his duties is a good example. I really wonder if the writers even saw the previous films. There being no explanation as to what, specifically, cursed Salazar and his crew when their ship crashed in the Devil's Triangle also annoyed me a little. I can't say it was good from a writing standpoint overall, but none of those inconsistencies and little annoyances took me out of the film.The wedding scene - yuck! Why was this even in the film at all? Who thought that an audience would actually find it funny? I seriously closed my eyes when it came up. It was so gross and pointless. Why give nonfans more ammunition to trash the franchise?The zombie sharks - why have them at all? I just thought they were a little too OTT even for Pirates because Salazar had no real need for them and I think they tried too hard with the gross factor by adding flies in their mouths... Blah. The CGI for them also looked pretty bad, but that entire chase scene was actually pretty fun despite being too OTT.The Trident of Poseidon - this is kind of an issue with the writing, bu I didn't care for this MacGuffin at all. Much like Henry and Carina who I'll talk about later, I thought it was completely unneeded and detracted from the story. I really didn't like the phoned-in rule that all curses at sea were held inside the Trident because it again contradicts rules established in the previous films.Henry and Carina - I thought both actors were pretty good, but the characters themselves couldn't escape feeling like complete ripoffs on Will and Elizabeth. They were obviously trying to recapture that CotBP love story vibe with these two characters, and while they were enjoyable to see on screen unlike that awful clergyman and mermaid love story in OST, I thought they were also unneeded characters at the end of the day.Barbossa - as much as I love and welcome Geoffery Rush in the role, I feel like the ending of OST where he killed Blackbeard and took the Queen Anne's Revenge was a great end for his character arc, with him finally sailing the seas as a pirate yet again. Here I feel like he didn't even need to be a part of the film and the only purpose his presence really served was to release the Black Pearl from the bottle and for sake of a really hamfisted twist that didn't jive with me at all. Ultimately I feel like they really screwed up Barbossa.So at the end of the day, I feel this film is nowhere near the level of bad 0/10 that critics and nonfans want it to be, but at the same time, it is simply a lazily-written entertaining film. For all of their faults, Pirates 3 and 4 are honestly more solid films than this from a writing standpoint. Technically I would rate this about a 7, but to bring the IMDb user consensus score to a more reasonable level, I'll give it an 8.",8,0,1,30 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Still beating the same dead horse
","Did we really need a ninth Star Wars film? Is there really anything new they could have brought to the table? Not really, and for the most part they don't, but I actually thought this was a minor improvement over The Force Awakens and definitely leagues more entertaining than the bland and abysmal Rogue One, but that doesn't really say much.I mainly give it a pass because Mark Hamill was really great in his role despite his character material being questionable. Adam Driver also kills it as Kylo Ren here and he is shaping up to be a good villain in Episode IX - but beyond those things however, it's just more of the same old same old. Not necessarily 'bad' same old same old, but still nothing we haven't seen before. It's beating the same dead horse as the Transformers series.I did think it was very well-made from a technical standpoint with a a lot of beautiful and well-choreographed shots, but the problem with this movie is that the newcomer characters still remain uninteresting and poorly-developed whilst most of the original cast are killed off.So it's more entertaining than Rogue One and a slight improvement over The Force Awakens, but aside from Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, and being well-made, it doesn't have many positive things to say about itself on its resume. I only rate it 1/10 to bring the IMDb general consensus down to a more reasonable score, normally I would rate it about 6/10.",1,22,30,31 December 2018
Thor," An underappreciated installment that deserves a revisit
","Many Marvel fans and nonfans alike tend to view this film as one of the weaker entries in the MCU, especially after the release of Ragnarok - but I personally couldn't disagree more. I hated the third installment of the Thor series because the main villain was terrible from a character writing perspective and I absolutely loathed the nonstop comedic direction that they took. But this isn't a review on that film nor is it me trying to force my opinion down your throat, this is why I personally love Branagh's Thor and why I feel it deserves a revisit.The set designs for Asgard are off the charts beautiful. While we may only see Asgard for 50% of the movie and Earth for the other 50%, it is far more memorable and unique here than it was in The Dark World and Ragnarok where it looked like a discount Game of Thrones set.Patrick Doyle's soundtrack for this film is probably the best in the entire MCU. If you tried to name the original scores from Age of Ultron, Ant-Man 1 and 2, or even Infinity War and Iron Man 1 and 2, you just can't because they are just so bland and devoid of identity. With Thor's soundtrack however, you instantly know which movie it belongs to - and the soundtrack is used perfectly for almost every scene in the film.At least an hour's worth of this film is dedicated to Thor's development. This isn't like The Dark World where Thor more or less begins and ends as the same generic superhero character or even the first two Avengers movies where his character just isn't very interesting - here he actually begins as an entirely different person than what he is at the end of the movie. His character may not be as sympathetic or memorable as Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins or Tony Stark in Iron Man 1, but he at least has a point where he hits rock bottom unlike all of the other portrayals of MCU Thor prior to Ragnarok. The important thing about Thor in this film, to me, is that he actually redeems himself -something mostly lacking from Thor's other MCU appearances - and earns his powers back during the Destroyer's rampage in New Mexico.While I still love plenty of other aspects of the film, my main attachment to it is our introduction to Loki, who makes a great villain. Tom Hiddleston was the perfect casting decision for the character and so many scenes with him are masterful. The reveal of him being a Frost Giant and confronting Odin about it is a 10/10. My only issue with Loki here, which certainly doesn't stop me from loving the character and enjoying the film, is his goal had his plan come to full fruition - if I had learned that my father had lied to me my entire life, the last thing I would be concerned about is trying to impress him. Nevertheless, he is one of the best villains in the MCU and this film is a great introduction to him. And unlike Hela in Ragnarok, Loki works really well because you get a sense of there being a fleshed-out relationship between him and Thor and he has relatable motivations, unlike Hela who was just evil for the sake of being evil and had practically no relationship with Thor.Anthony Hopkins also does a great job playing Odin and Idris Elbra is really good as Heimdall. The Warriors Three aren't the greatest characters in the world but they still work just fine.I can understand how the scenes on Earth in New Mexico involving Jane Foster and her friends Selvig and Darcy would be a drag for many casual fans since the chemistry between Portman and Chemsworth is often lacking and comes off a bit forced, but for me none of it was ever a deal-breaker.So you can have your Thor cracking bad one-liner after one-liner and not really earning anything in Ragnarok, or you can have your stereotypical superhero with almost no development like Thor in The Dark World, but give me the Thor that Branagh gave us and give me Loki as the main villain. Give me the amazing Asgard sets and Patrick Doyle's soundtrack. Give me world-building and not literal world-destroying like Ragnarok. Loki's development in this film alone outshines anything in Thor 2 and 3 IMO.",9,0,0,30 December 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Not the worst, but not the best either
","For the most part I enjoyed this movie for what it was, but the biggest flaw with it is that it has a hard time justifying its existence beyond being a sequel for the sole purpose of having a sequel. The best parts are easily Loki's development, but he's honestly not in the film that much. The problem is that, beyond Loki, it just isn't very interesting and the plot is utterly uninspired and predictable.While I actually rather enjoyed the cheesiness of Makekith and the Dark Elves, as characters they were still unimpressive. Another thing that did annoy me is how Asgard no longer looked gold and grand as it did in the first Thor movie by Branagh and instead it looked like your average Game of Thrones set (which is appropriate since the director was also involved with GoT). Without Loki around, Thor's character here honestly isn't very interesting and he just feels like a generic superhero. The score is good but it still isn't anywhere near as memorable as Patrick Doyle's score for the first film.Overall it is just an OK movie and a fine watch when binging the other Marvel films. It is far from being Marvel's absolute worst film as many Marvel fans and nonfans alike proclaim, but it's still a massive step downward from what the first Thor movie was and it really didn't add much to the MCU as a whole other than the Reality Stone/Aether and Loki usurping the throne of Asgard.",6,0,0,30 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," How to Sell a Film with its Name
","Bare in mind this is coming from someone who was really never much of a Star Wars fan and has found at least 2/3 of films in the series extremely 'meh', but I thought 90% of this film was a completely unnecessary and uninspired retread of previous Star Wars material. The plot is an extremely eye-rolling carbon copy of the original 1977 film whilst 90% of the characters are completely cardboard and uninteresting. There was potential mind you, but Rey is the epitome of a Mary Sue and Poe, Finn, and whatever other characters there were, were completely forgettable. The one exception to this is Kylo Ren, who is an admittedly interesting character but he isn't given enough to do. There are only maybe two scenes in the entire film that I found remotely entertaining, and those are the last scene involving Han along with maybe the lightsaber duel near the end. But beyond that, it is a horribly bland film. It's still well-made and well-shot, but at its core, it's mostly hollow. The only reason it got positive reception and made the amount of money it did was because of the Star Wars name and nothing more. If this film had a different title, its Rotten Tomatoes score would be in the 30's.Normally I'd rate this more like a 3/10, but given that the general IMDb consensus is surprisingly an 8/10. all it's getting for now is a 1/10.",1,15,21,13 June 2018
Incredibles 2," How the mighty have fallen...
","Let's be honest with ourselves - Incredibles 1 is the only movie where the 'the world is afraid of superheroes so they need government supervision' plot trope worked. In everything else it's just boring and tedious (Civil War, Batman v. Superman, etc.). So what's the logical choice for the plot of this movie? Revisit that trope for what feels like the one millionth time.It starts out promising, but the plot is one of the most boring and cliche I've seen in a superhero movie in a long time. Elastigirl is the only character who gets anything to do, meanwhile all Mr. Incredible gets to do prior to the third act is stay at home taking care of the kids. They play with this subplot of Violet having a crush on this one boy from school (can't remember his name), but they barely make anything out of it. And to top all of this ugliness off, the film copies the 'villain twist' from Iron Man 3 with this lame throwaway character called Screenslaver who is only in the film for about 50 seconds. Meanwhile, the real villain is incredibly cliched and forgettable.All around a total fail and letdown of a sequel. Boring, cliche, and nothing we haven't seen before. I'm surprised it got the amount of positive reception that it did. Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man 2 and 3, Age of Ultron, and Ant-Man and the Wasp are honestly better superhero movies than this.The only reason I rate this a 1/10 is to bring the general user consensus down to a more reasonable score. Normally I would rate this about a 5/10 or a 5.5/10 if I'm generous.",1,6,14,30 December 2018
