Ali," Islam this - Islam that
","The film 'Ali' was one of the worst boxing films of all time. To be honest, I don't even regard this film as an action/drama film at all. All this film is, is an Islam promotion/documentary on what its about to be a Muslim. Will Smith who played the part of Muhammed Ali/ Cassius Clay was an alright choice for the part, however I can't even take him seriously as an actor anymore for I can only remember him as a child actor (ie.In the TV series - The Fresh Prince of Bel air) and not an adult actor. Fine - Being a Muslim is what Muhammed Ali was all about, but whether or not Malcolm X was assassinated and everything else in this film that had to do with Islamic history and lifestyle should be irrelevant to this film, as this film should be about Muhammed Ali becoming the Heavy weight Boxing Champion, and not the Muslim prophet Muhammed and Malcolm X. If your thinking about becoming a Muslim, than go ahead and watch the film 'Ali', but otherwise don't bother.",5,0,1,12 December 2004
The Terminator," Nobody goes home, nobody else comes through. Its just him - and me
","The Terminator is definitely one of the best Science fiction films ever made. A lot of people argue on which film is better Terminator 1 or Terminator 2, but in my opinion the first Terminator film is the better film. Although Terminator 2 (also 3) were fantastic films with better action scenes and special effects than the first Terminator film, what I prefer about the first Terminator film is the good acting,(especially by Kyle Rees/Michael Biehn) sense of depth and storyline that the other two sequels lacked. What all three Terminator films had in common were that they had elements of Science Fiction and action in them, but what the first Terminator film had that the other sequels didn't have was that it had a romance element. The romantic side of this film is how Kyle Rees travelled back in time to meet Sarah Connor(to save her from the Terminator) and falling in love with one another, while conceiving their son John Connor during their short time together. This film is quite similar to the film 'Somewhere in Time' with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour for that film is also about a man who travels back in time to be with the women he loved.The whole concept of how Kyle Rees was sent back in time from the year 2027 to the year 1984 to save Sarah Connors life from the Terminator and then impregnating her with John Connor (the Future Saviour) is a mind boggling concept. Where does it all begin and end? If Kyle Rees from the future didn't go back in time to the year 1984, John Connor would never have been, but yet it makes absolutely no sense WHATSOVER, that Kyle Rees could be his father considering the peculiar circumstances - however he was his father for unexplainable reasons. The story just goes round and round in circles. In answer to how John Connor was Kyle Rees' son was that the original John Connor from the year 2027 wasn't Kyle Rees' son as he was somebody elses son. When John Connor sent Kyle Rees to the year 1984 to save his mothers life from the Terminator, Kyle Rees accidentally corrupted history by impregnating Sarah Connor with their son John Connor, who of which wasn't the original John Connor. When Sarah Connor found out that she was pregnant with Kyles son, she mistakenly assumed that her unborn child was the saviour John Connor from the future - when he wasn't. The real John Connor would have been a son that she would have had with another man(In a different parallel universe) who of which was never born, for Kyle Rees prevented her from meeting him because he changed history by telling her about the future - as this somehow prevented her from meeting the father of the real future saviour John Connor and bearing him as there son. Thereafter the alternate John Connor who was conceived from Kyle Rees became the new future Saviour only because his mother prepared him for it and because he wanted to live up to his mothers death wish. Its all quite complicated; the whole sequential repetitive cycle of Kyle Rees going back in time to the year 1984 and then another 44 years passes to the year 2027 and then Kyle rees travels back to the year 1984 is a never ending cycle, as its an infinite cycle that goes round and round in circles forever. The first cycle of the original undisrupted John Connor who sent his Sergeant (not father) Kyle Rees to the year 1984, was in fact the only undisrupted future history cycle that happened. However, every other time travel sequence that goes on and on forever in time travel circles that occurred after that original time travel cycle, was in fact the disrupted time travel cycles with the alternate John Connor in a new and changed parallel universe - this is as explained all due to Kyle Rees accidentally altering history. Considering the alternate John Connor took over from the original John Connor who of which got erased from time all due to Kyle Rees, one could say that the original John Connor never even existed - but yet he did! He lives in the lost dimensions/parallel universe of time.As this film is Science fictional, romantic and action based it caters for many types of viewers, whether you're a love-sick girl/ women, a person who is action thirst or just somebody with a good imagination for imaginative people, like myself, do tend to love science fiction films.Anyway, if you haven't seen this film, I strongly suggest you to watch it, for this film is non stop action, has great film atmosphere and had a great and original storyline",9,4,5,26 March 2010
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Brilliant
","Although this film 'Terminator 3' Rise of the machines wasn't as good as the first two Terminator films, I can still say that I enjoyed this film. Considering how very few of the original actors were in this film, that were in the first two Terminator films, other than Arnold Swartzeneger the Terminator and Earl Boen(Dr.Peter Silberman) who was Sarah Connors Psychiatrist, I thought this film carried itself extremely well. I thought the lighting and special effects were superb and the directors choice of making the new Terminator into a woman was a great and original idea. In many ways I found this sequel somewhat more humorous compared to the other Terminator films, a humour that the other films lacked. The scene when the Terminatrix(Kristanna Loken) breasts grew larger after looking at the large breasted women on the billboard poster and when Arnold Swartzeneger(the Terminator) walked into the strip club in the nude, for everybody thought that he was a stripper hired by the nightclub, I found extremely funny. I did, however, find it unrealistic when the Terminator was deprogrammed by the Terminatrix to become bad and then mentally fought his deprogramming to remain good and managing to shut his system down. That was so unreal! Why - because the Terminator is a Cyborg, not a person. It doesn't have feelings of its own. Its programmed to follow his orders - nothing more. As all Terminator fans know, that John Connors father(Kyle Rhys) who was one of John Connors Sergeants in the future was sent back in time to the year 1984 to save Johns mother(Sarah Connor) from being killed by the Terminator. It would have been good if the Terminator named John Connors fathers name(Kyle Rhys) to John Connor(Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster(Claire Danes) when he was telling them the listed names of the Terminatrix' assassin hitlist, who were John Connors top Sergeants/ Lieutenants in the future, that she was planning to kill. That would have been ironic for this film, for his father(Kyle Rhys) was one of John Connors top Sergeants in the year 2027, but unfortunately his name wasn't mentioned on that list. Then again, it was only fair that he wasn't on the hit list for Kyle Rees wasn't alive in the year 1997 as he was born in the year 2006. Despite the ways I feel this film could have improved, I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend anybody to watch it, as this film had amazing special effects, exciting action scenes and most of all had a fantastic storyline.",7,2,4,15 December 2004
Rocky IV," The worst Rocky Film ever made
","This film 'Rocky 4' started off really good for Ivan Drago is like no Boxer you've ever seen, for his freakish strength and powerful outlook was most scary and intimidating and it was also quite sad and emotional when he killed Apollo Creed in the ring, however as the film went on, it completely went down hill. Up until the point when Rocky and his family arrives in Russia this film was alright, but thereafter that scene this movie became dull and boring.Not only I found this film boring, but I found the storyline completely ridiculous for there is no way that Rocky Balboa (The Italian Stallion) could have possibly defeated a powerhouse musclebound freak like Ivan Drago. If Ivan Drago was strong enough to kill Apollo Creed in the ring than there is no way that Rocky Balboa could have possibly beaten Ivan Drago. In fact, he's lucky to have even survived the fight.As a Rocky fan, i've enjoyed all the films except parts 2 and 4 but if you haven't seen parts 2 and 4 I recommend you to watch them anyway because although they were boring films, you need to watch them in order to understand where the next Rocky sequel is coming from.",5,2,6,16 February 2005
Saving Private Ryan," One of the worst war films ever made!
","I still don't understand today, why this film got such excellent reviews.'Saving Private Ryan' was one of the worst war films I have ever seen in my life. This film had no proper storyline and plot, as it was a load of Hollywood Hype that tried to come across as deep and dramatic, but in actual fact, was shallow and disappointing. What was the point of all those soldiers dying in Combat, only to find/save one soldier, and that when they found him, he didn't want to come back home with them. Yes, this film had its dramatic scenes, like at the beginning of the film when old Private Ryan was crying at his friends gravestone, but even the way that scene was portrayed, I found it was corny and melodramatic. Overall, this film completely dragged-on, as it had bad editing, a pathetic dialogue and had a terrible conclusion.",5,1,3,5 November 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A show-off poser film
","This is the kind of film that you may very much like when you first watch it, as one may get carried away with the bright lights, fancy costumes and model actors, but if you have any depth, whatsoever, you'll soon change your mind after you've seen this film at least twice and realise that beyond the colourful, superficial glamorous surface of this film, that it is nothing but a load of shallow nonsense. Although this film had spectacular lighting, good choreography and most of all, great talented acting, this film had no proper storyline. Although, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were the perfect people to act in this film, as they are both incredibly talented actors (ie.Singing and Dancing) I found this film completely fake and hollow. The reason why some people may enjoy this film is because they have mistaken this film for what they believe is sophisticated culture, but in actual fact, isn't. In my opinion, this film is a hyped-up, over rated chick-flick, and if thats your type of film, than watch it, if not, don't bother.",5,0,2,10 November 2004
Back to the Future Part III," okay film sequal. Though I preferred the first two.
","Back to the future (Part 3) started off really good, but went down-hill as the film went on. In between the scenes when Marty was recovered in the McFly home in 1885 by his great great grandparents and when Marty arrived back home to the year 1985 I found this film quite boring, but before and after those scenes, I found this film quite entertaining.In all three Back to the Future films there's sequences in which Marty and his descendants/ancestors are being confronted in a cafe/bar by Biff and his descendants/ancestors as well as when Marty injures himself and ends up being recovered in his mothers/great great grand mothers home and including a few other examples. I quite like this repeated sequence in the first two films, but seeing it again in the third film simply bored me, for its as though the same old storyline in all three films is being regurgitated over and over again with no originality whatsoever.If you think about it, there's no reason why Marty should have been temporarily stuck in the year 1885. The fact that Marty and the Doc couldn't fuel-up the delorean as there was no fuel(gas) facility in the year 1885 shouldn't have been a problem. Why - because if Doc Brown was able to write Marty a letter from the year 1885 for Marty to receive in the year 1955 and as a result of the letter Marty then went back in time to the year 1885, he could of also easily written in the same letter to Marty to receive in the year 1955 asking him to bring an extra supply of gas fuel when he visits the Doc in the year 1885. Itr would have been the only way we can get back home to the future'. Then they wouldn't have gone through the hassle of being pushed by a runaway train in order to get up to 88 miles per hour. This is just one example on how this film didn't make sense as there are many more examples similar to this one that I won't get into. One good element about this film is how it shows how bad things happen for a reason. When Marty went back in time and changed his parents destiny from being losers to winners, he not only changed his families past and present lives, but he also changed his families future - but for the worst. Seeing as Marty changed his fathers destiny, as a result of this change his father George McFly didn't loan his 4 by 4 jeep to Biff, for which Biff would've smashed up in a car accident in the parallel universe for when George was afraid of Biff. If Marty didn't change his fathers destiny, his father George McFly would've loaned the jeep to Biff out of fear and the car would've have been totalled in a car crash. That car was destined to crash! So that Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer wouldn't have used it that night to go camping, in which they wouldn't have crashed it out of a dare from Douglas Needles to go drag racing - leaving their and their children's lives in ruins, for which this car crash led to a result of their children being arrested in the year 2015. However their children's problems in the year 2015 was fixed when Marty and the Doc changed it for when they travelled into the future to the year 2015. It goes to show that although Marty did change his families lives for the better, in the long run it would have been better if he had left things the way they were. Destiny is set for a reason, whether its good or bad.I think making a third sequel to this film was a good idea, but I think it would have been a lot better if the director of this film made this sequel completely different from the first two films. A good idea would have been if Marty and the Doc were travelling all over time to different years doing whatever they want and meeting up with themselves in the same year that they've visited more than once without worrying about a time travel paradox. In my opinion this film could have improved, but even though I feel this way I'd recommend anyone to watch it, for it did have some good moments and if you've seen the first two 'Back to the Future' films you've gotta see this film in order to complete the trilogy.",6,1,3,21 February 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Richie, would you do me a favour and eat my p*s*y for me...please?
","The film 'From Dusk till Dawn' is a fantastic film for the excellent choice of actors, great soundtrack and extreme storyline made this film into a one of a kind. I can understand, however, a person not liking this film, but in order to appreciate this film you have to have the right mindset. By doing so you must realise that you can't take this film seriously and that its just another typical black horror Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarentino film. What I love about this film is how extreme the storyline changes on how an ordinary family gets kidnapped by wanted criminals, Seth Gecko(George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) and is forced by these criminals to smuggle them in their camper-van over the Mexican border and how the story changes from that to blood sucking vampires killing everybody in the Mexican biker nightclub. I quite like this style of directing for the director Stanley Kubrick has a similar directing approach, for many of his films story lines do tend to rapidly change half way through the film in the same way. Another directing trademark that Robert Rodriguez and Stanley Kubrick have in common, that I'm quite entertained by is the micro-second subliminal film shots that was filmed in this movie, in which the same micro-second subliminal filming was also done in Stanley Kubricks film 'A Clockwork Orange' This happened when Seth Gecko(George Clooney) walked into the motel room and viewed the woman hostage lying dead on his bed, in which his brother Richard gecko (Quentin Tarantino) had just raped and killed.The actors Juliette Lewis(Kate Fuller), George Clooney(Seth Gecko), Quentin Tarantino(Richard Gecko and Harvey Keitel(Jacob Fuller) are ideal actors for this film. What intrigues me about Harvey Keitel, George Clooney and Juliette Lewis is not the fact that their good actors, but is how confident their acting is, for in my opinion these actors (and a few other actors) are three of the most confident actors in Hollywood. What I like about Quentin Tarantino is that although he's not a great actor, the role that he does play in this film (and others) he does well at, for his eccentric acting, humour and wacky outlook makes me love watching him in films. Anyway if you haven't seen this film, I suggest you to watch it, for if you like George Clooney and Harvey Keitel you'll definitely like this film.",7,0,1,23 April 2005
A Clockwork Orange," I'v taught you much my little Droogies! So tell me what you had in mind Georgie Boy!!!
","Clockwork Orange is a classic 'Stanley Kubrick' production, as its a film way ahead of its time. I admit this film was low budget, with disturbing scenes and the storyline/plot got cut in half from one extreme to the next, but I think what held this film together was its great acting, soundtrack, memorable scenes and its genius script/ dialogue for its Russian Lingo, Old-style Cockney accents and sophisticated (yet hip), Cult-Like London jargon, made this film a 'One of a kind'.I can understand a person not liking this film (especially women), considering the rape and violence, but in order to appreciate this film, you've gotta look beyond that; By doing so, you'll need to watch this film at least twice in order to absorb the unique dialogue and Lingo (ie. If you want a motorcar - you pluck it from the trees and if you want pretty Polly - you take it) and of course its amazing memorable scenes. The scenes I love in this film are when Alex chatted up the two women in the record shop, when Alex was strait jacketed in the Institution (with his eyes held open), while watching the violent films, when Alex beat-up Georgie and cut open Dims hand at the canal (in Slow motion), when Alex wacked Dims lap, with his cane, in the milk-bar, after Dim mocked the ladies singing ! and several other scenes. However, these scenes wouldn't have been half as good as they were, without the brilliant soundtrack in the background. Another element of this film that I quite liked, were the subliminal (micro-second) camera shots that Stanley Kubrick hid within the film. This happened when Alex dropped the over-sized penis ornament on the catwomans head. If you haven't seen 'Clockwork Orange' and would like to, than go ahead and watch it. However, please concentrate on the external view of the film and not the internal view of it, as its the only way you'll appreciate watching it.",8,0,2,6 December 2004
The Fly," He dreamt he was a man and loved it, but now the dreams over and the insect is awake
","The film 'The Fly' has one of the saddest story lines I have ever seen in a horror(Sci-fi and drama) film. Its about a man named Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) who invents a Teleportation machine and accidentally teleports himself with a fly from one transmitting pod to another, which places the insects genetics into Seth Brundle, causing him to slowly mutate into a giant insect. What mostly moved me about this film was the sorrow and pity I felt for Seth Brundle and his girlfriend Veronica (Geena Davis) as he was mutating into an giant insect. To see a man who loved life so much and finally making it in life by meeting the woman of his dreams and by succeeding in his six year goal in inventing Teleportation and then losing it all by transforming into a monster, is enough to put a tear into my eye. I admit this film in many aspects was quite hideous, but because Jeff Goldblums and Geena Davis' acting was so proper and convincing, this is what made the film into what it is. The scene when Seth Brundle went smashing threw the abortion clinic window and then trying to convince Veronica (Geena Davis) not to abort his unborn baby as the baby was the only thing left of the real him, I thought was very sad and moving for Jeff Goldblums acting was so real and professional in that scene, I honestly don't think that any other actor could have played the role of Seth Brundle better than him. I recommend anybody to see this film for I rate it an 7 out of 10.",7,36,57,11 December 2004
Reservoir Dogs," A load of tripe
","This film had its good moments like when the gangsters were planning the robbery in the basement and when they were sitting in the cafe discussing about waitress tipping etc..but on whole I thought this film was rubbage. The funny thing is, is that I've always enjoyed watching these actors in different films(ie Harvey Keitel), but in 'Resevoir Dogs' I hated watching them because there acting (for once) was terrible, when usually I like there acting. However, the only actor I did like watching and did act well was Tim Roth for he is a superb actor. The scenes of the gangsters in the warehouse arguing and torturing the Policemen/Marvin Nash, I thought was childish, bad acting(especially by Mr.Pink/Steve Buscemi) for they clowned around talking non-sense and when they weren't doing that, they were either killing one another or behaving like kids on trying to find out who the rat of the pack was. This film completely dragged on, for it had a lame dialogue with no proper plot. I always wondered, did Mr. Pink get away with the diamonds in the end, or did the cops catch him with them?",5,1,3,4 November 2004
Titanic," Iv seen better Titanic films
","When I first saw this film, I absolutely loved it, as I got carried away with the fantastic special effects, good acting and great soundtrack. However, in order to realise what this film is truly about, you have to watch it at least twice in order to understand that this film is a load of ignorant and political nonsense. First of all, the storyline was completely ridiculous and unreal. The fact that a hoodlum vagrant like Jack Dawson(Leonardo Dicaprio) could possibly seduce a highly sophisticated lady such as Kate Winslet(Rose De Witt Bukater) is impossible. Having a fling with him is possible, but to have left her successful rich Fiancé Billy Zane (Caledon Hockley) for Jack Dawson would never happen in real life. Second of all, this film had untrue facts to what really happened at the Titanic tragedy and its main focus was to praise the Irish and to racistly put down the British. The fact that the British boat loader gunned-down the Irish hoodlum, never actually happened in history, as that man was a hero, not a murderer. Also, the fact that the British racistly locked the Irish in the third class section when the Titanic was sinking was untrue to the way it was portrayed. Yes, the third class section was probably locked up in the basement when the Titanic was sinking, however it was a class issue, not a racist issue. There were just as many European and British people in the third class section, as there were Irish and many Irish people in the first and second class section as well. So the fact that the third class people were locked up in the basement because they were Irish was completely nonfactual. Besides which, statistics show that more Irish people survived the Titanic disaster than any other nationality on that boat.Last of all, for James Cameron to write and direct a love story based on the Titanic tragedy is totally insensitive and disrespectful to the victims, family and descendants of the Titanic tragedy. There's nothing wrong with making a film based on the Titanic disaster, but to make a fictional romantic love story on the Titanic disaster is completely wrong. Whats next - James Cameron directing a romantic love story about a couple who fell in love in the New York Twin Towers(9/11) disaster on the day it collapsed, with people jumping out of windows (with heartfelt music in the background) and hitting the ground. Now that would be truly sick. Anyway, if you've never seen this film and would like to see it, I suggest you view it at least twice as that'll be the only way you'll truly understand the real meaning of the film.",6,4,8,4 December 2004
Rocky III," He's a killer...he's a wrecking machine. He'll knock you out inside of three rounds Rock.
","The film Rocky 3 was definitely, in my opinion, the best Rocky film of all time. Some people might argue with this by saying that Rocky 1 was the best as it showed the rise of Rocky in boxing and the romantic side from when he fell in love with Adrian, others might prefer Rocky 2 for when Rockys son was born, doing his TV commercial advertisement and when he became the Heavy weight champion of the world, while others might prefer Rocky 4 after the coming of boxer Ivan Drago, the sadness of Apollo Creed dying and when Rocky travelled to Russia. Although most of the Rocky films were spectacular, I have to say that Rocky 3 compared to the other Rocky films had so much more to offer compared to the other Rocky films as it was action packed and ongoing excitement all the way through the film. It had Rockys boss Micky dying, Mr.T and Hulk Hogan(and Wrestle-mania),the building of Rockys statue, it had Rocky losing everything and then getting it all back again and the brilliant one line quotes (ie. When the newscaster said to Clubber lang 'Whats your prediction for tomorrow nights fight'... Clubber Lang replies 'Prediction'...Newscaster replies 'Yes Prediction'... Clubber Lang replies... PAIN!! and from when Clubber Lang says to Rockys wife 'If you bring your pretty little self on down to my apartment tonight, I will show you a real man etc...) and not to mention the fact that this film had three fights while every other Rocky film had a maximum of two fights. Also for Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone)to fight in the ring two hard man icons such as Mr. T and Hulk Hogan is quite a spectacular challenge for one Rocky film to offer as no other Rocky film has ever matched up to it.If you haven't seen the Rocky films, then watch Rocky 3, followed by the first two Rocky films for I gaurantee you that if you like boxing films, you will definitely like Rocky 3.",9,0,0,15 September 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Is that crazy enough for you, do you want me to take a s**t on the floor
","One of the best films ever made, as I can just watch it again and again and never get board of watching it. It goes to show how good the film was, that almost every main actor in this film made a success in acting after taking role in this movie. Jack Nicholson was truly made for the part as RP McMurphy, as nobody else could have played the part more convincing and dramatic as he did. To perform a film set in a mental Institution takes an incredible amount of patience from both the directors/actors to learn how to act mental, as Danny Devito(Martini) and Christopher Lloyd(Taber) were especially remarkable at this, as they knew how to put on such convincing mental facial reactions (ie.when C.Lloyd was screaming/laughing when Will Sampson(The Chief) escaped from the mental Institution and when D.Devito(Martini) was playing Monopoly with Harding as he put his hotel piece on the board.This film in all aspects was funny, witty, heartfelt, dramatic and quite realistic, as all the way through the film you are either angry, laughing, crying, at something or other, that is going on in the film, whether its being angry with Nurse Ratchett(Louise Fletcher)over her legalism, or crying when Billy(Brad Dourif) harms himself at the end of the film or even laughing at the way RP McMurphy was acting, when he was listening/ observing Mr.Hardings and Mr.Tabers argument during Nurse Ratchetts therapy group. There is not a moment in this film, for which ones emotions aren't triggered, as this film is 'all go' and never drags-on. If you haven't seen this film and would like to, please watch it, for I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. PS Memorable/Favourite quote - I don't have anymore questions, do you have any questions Mr. McMurphy 'Where do you suppose she lives'",10,1,2,4 November 2004
Back to the Future Part II," Great Scott - this is Heavy
","Back to the Future 2 is a brilliant sequel, for its incredible futuristic special effects made this film into a Classic Time Travel movie. There was a period, however, when the entire film went stagnant and downhill, but did pick-up again as the film went on. Up until the part when Marty McFly(Micheal J. Fox) returned to the alternate(Biff ruled) 1985 for when Marty got hit over the head by Biffs goons infront of the Clocktower/Biffs Casino Hotel this film was spectacular, but thereafter that scene, this film endlessly dragged-on.In time this film did pick-up again when Marty McFly went back in time to the year 1955 to retrieve the Sports Almanac that Old Biff gave to young Biff, for that spiced up the film again. Even though I very much enjoyed this film, I did find that there were loads of contradictions in it that didn't make sense. The scene when Old Biff travelled back in time from the year 2015 to the year 1955 to give the Sports Almanac to himself (so he can win money on horse racing by knowing the winning results ahead of time) and then returned to the year 2015 didn't quite match up. This is because when Old Biff travelled back in time to the year 1955 giving himself(Young Biff) the Sports Almanac so he could become rich, he did in fact change history. This means that when he returned to the year 2015 it should have been the new alternate(Biff ruled) 2015, but it wasn't, for it was the same normal 2015 that he departed from.Another scene is when Marty and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) went back home to the year 1985 after fixing Martys family problems in the year 2015, didn't make proper sense either because seeing how old Biff changed history, that prevented Marty and Doc Brown from ever meeting one another and even Doc Brown from inventing the Time machine. This doesn't match up either - for this would have caused a time travel paradox that Doc Brown often speaks about, which would have ceased their existences to time as they knew it, and their souls would have been redeemed into the new alternate(1985) existences, for Marty would have become the new Marty that lives in a boarding school in Switzerland and Doc Brown would have been redeemed into the life of the alternate existence of being committed into a mental Institution, but it didn't happen that way. Instead, there were two Doc Browns and two Marty McFlys living in the same year and from different parallel universes/ time vessels - and many other examples of contradiction that just go on and on. Mind you, this film is a Comedy/Sci-fi and seeing as time travel is a fantasy subject, a person really can't take these contradictions seriously, for this film 'Back to the Future/ Part 2'(and other time travel movies) are about enjoying yourself and having a laugh. Despite this films contradictions which aren't a big deal anyway, i'd recommend anybody to watch this movie for the acting was good, especially Thomas Wilson(Biff/Griff Tannen) who performed a fantastic acting job, the special effects/background was amazing along with its great lighting and colour co-ordination and most of all the storyline was good. However, this film didn't have the most original storyline as this films storyline was copied from the film 'Its a wonderful life' but don't let that put you off watching the film 'Back to the future/Part 2' for the film 'Its a wonderful life' was a beautiful movie with a great storyline with a great plot and moral.",8,30,57,16 December 2004
The Breakfast Club," The next screw that falls out is going to be you!
","The Breakfast club is one of the best teen movies ever made. Although this film is low budget, I found this film to be very precise and realistic to what high school environments are all about. Its about five high school students that attend a high school detention session one Saturday and all became good friends by the end of the session.What I found realistic about this film is how the director John Hughes managed to include every social class that children have in the high school environment. You've got Brian Johnson (Michael Anthony Hall) the nerd, John Bender(Judd Nelson) as the rebel punk, Claire Standish(Molly Ringwold) as the prude, Allison Reynolds(Ally Sheely) as the weirdo and Andrew Clarke (Emilio Estevez) as the jock. You even have Richard Vernon as the strict angry teacher(Paul Gleason) which stereotypes a typical example of an American teacher. What I also liked about this film was the brilliant acting, especially Judd Nelson who played John Bender for without him this film wouldn't have been half as good as it was. Although he was a punk, I found his persona quite cool and yet funny in the ways he behaved with his piers and his teacher Richard Vernon. Even though John Bender was in the wrong with Mr. Vernon and how Mr. Vernon got the best of him, I did respect John for standing up for himself against his teacher and for getting the best of Mr. Vernon by escaping from the room he was locked up in by Mr. Vernon and without Mr. Vernon knowing about it. I loved the scene when he yelled out to Mr. Vernon f**k you when Mr.Vernon left the room. Anyway, if you haven't seen this film then you should definitely watch it, for I believe the moral of this film is that whatever social class your apart of whether your a nerd, a jock, a prude, a weirdo or a rebel, we're all the same, no persons better than the next.",8,0,1,20 February 2005
Back to the Future," Hey McFly! Hey I'm talking to you McFly you Irish bug!
","This film is a Classic time travel film for when I first saw it as a child, i've loved it ever since. This film is without a doubt the best 'Back to the future' film ever made. What makes this film different from the other sequels is how it maintains its sense of fun and excitement all the way through the film. What I mean, is that although (Part 2 and 3) were good films, they didn't maintain its on-going thrill like the first film did. All three films had a sequence in which Martys mother/great-great grandmother had recovered Marty in either the McFly home, Baines home or at Biff Tannens home at the casino hotel until he woke up some hours later. In sequels 2 and 3 these films were good up until those scenes and then went completely down-hill after. In part 1, this film never went down-hill from beginning to end. The only aspect of this film that I didn't understand that I'm sure many viewers have noticed are the contradictions this film made (ie. Why George/Loraine McFly didn't remember Marty in 1985, from 30 years before - even though Doc Brown remembered him) which included even more contradictions in parts 2 and 3. Also the scene when the Doc was trying to send Marty back to 1985(via. The Clock tower) when the Doc was up the Clock Tower connecting cables, for that scene completely dragged-on. Other than this, this film was perfect in every way; The acting was good (especially by Biff Tannen/Thomas Wilson) it had an original storyline, perfect soundtrack, had great stuntwork and had a good dialogue. If you haven't seen this film, I suggest you do, as it suites viewers of all ages, classes and cultures.",8,0,1,9 December 2004
