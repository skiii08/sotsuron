The Blair Witch Project," almost too good
","The Blair Witch Project is without a doubt the most original and unique movie I've seen in a long time.  Besides the bone chilling fear inflicted upon me, I left the theater seriously questioning whether the movie was real or not.  In all good sense I know that it was just a movie, but since seeing it I've seen a documentary on the scifi channel all about the Blair Witch that insists that there really was three film students that disappeared while doing a documentary on the Blair Witch and whose footage was found. This film has two qualities that are outstanding in my mind, the believability of the characters and my disbelief, against my better judgement, that it was just a movie.",8,2,3,3 August 1999
True Romance," classic love story
","what could be more romantic than this?  gun fights, prostitutes, pimps, murder.  not to mention Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  The combonation of the two of them together is nothing less than hot.  The film has Brad Pitt as a honey bear pot smoking loser, Gary Oldman as a glasseyeyed pimp, and Christopher Walken as the same kind of bad ass that he plays in every movie.  It's not your typical any kind of movie, but that's what's refreshing about it.  It's got a little bit of everything.",Null,1,2,6 August 1999
