"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," David Schwimmer directs Simon Pegg stars: and this has running power
","'Big Nothing' was a decent collaboration, but lacked punch. RFBR is much closer the mark - classic British humour all dressed up as a good comedy sports romance movie.It looks and feels like it got Ealing Comedy in its genes - or more recently The Tall Guy from the 80's, or Steve Coogan's The Parole Officer rather than class based comedies like Four Weddings - a good small low-key British comedy, with a nice parade of eccentrics - not high concept, not too low brow, rather good old fashioned heart which it absolutely wears its heart firmly on its sleeve.David Schwimmer seems comfortable behind the camera - our favourite scene in terms of camera was the bin fight - but overall you know what genre you watching and it doesn't require too much effort to relax and enjoy.The plot is a simple one - Dennis (Simon Pegg) gets cold feet and literally bolts on his wedding day from his pregnant fiancée, Libby (Thandie Newton). Five years on, and life has not been good to Dennis, he's suffering from middle-aged spread, working as a rent-a-cop for a lingerie store, and living below his Indian landlord (A wonderful Harish Patel, who deserves lots more work based on this).When his son starts bonding with Libby's new man Whit (Hank Azurius), whose everything Dennis is not, and American to boot, Dennis realizes the relationship with Libby is what he cares about and the only way to beat Whit is to run the same marathon as him. Needless to say Dennis is as fit as beached whale, but where the heart will, the body doth follow.His best friend, and unrepentant gambler Gordon (A super cynical Dylan Moran at his absolute laid back best) urges him on, partly for financial gain, and partly, well, because he enjoys seeing Dennis flounder and succeed.Like any competent sport movie we get the training etc; but here the emphasis is on the laughs.Of course, like any romantic comedy the pay off is sweet, and uplifting.It doesn't have enough bite to lift it up to the echelons of classic comedy - but it works well as a small comedy - there are lots of sweet touches that pay off - but not enough belly laughs to really satisfy.We like it a lot - the camera tells the story really well - nothing too smart, just good narrative filming. David Schwimmer definitely knows his British films - this looks and fells straight out of the genre - and you'd never guess a Yank made it - all the nuances are there. Nice.These guys obviously like each other and we look forward to seeing more from them in the future...Recommended as a good small British comedy.",7,44,63,16 February 2008
The King's Speech," My 360th Review: Superb, Entertaining, and A Real Film
","In an age of cookie cutter movies this stands out by a mile.With acting rather than action to the fore this is a masterclass is good production, great acting, and clear directorship.The story is both funny, accurate, and moving and records in detail the amazing transition of George from stuttering misfit to regal ruler with humility, humour, and a good lack of hubris.Above all this is film. It is captivating, the performances and the film meld together to take you to another place and it is always fun and interesting when history is so well captured and reproduced.It is, above all, refreshing to see a film that is original and entertaining. Some have complained it is over-sentimental - we didn't get that at all - I think rather it captures well the spirit of the British at that time - there is a sense of reserve in the film that lifts it to another level.With superb performances and very confident direction this is, quite simply, a wonderful film.",10,1,2,3 February 2011
Moneyball," 468th Review: Oscar worthy film about the real sports
","I love inspirational sports movies, who doesn't? But Moneyball is not that kind of movie - Moneyball is about the reality of big money, corporate sport - where millions buy the players - and results mean careers; and what we get is complex, satisfying, and interesting as a result.Moneyball is the true story of the league's 'poorest' baseball team, with a team roster bill of $37 million, one fifth of the big boys budget. It is also the tale of how the game changed forever through the smarter use of statistics.Shot in a style that is very reminiscent of The Social Network, semi-documentary camera angles (distance on speech for example, which traditional film narratives will cut in close-up, and close-up on non-narrative etc;) , this is smart film- making that doesn't resort to devices to drive it - it is a subtle piece of filming that compliments the story well.Above all though, this is a film of performances, and not just the excellent performance from Pitt, who rewards the viewer willing to try to understand what a General Manager must go through, and his team of coaches and players who really ring true.All in all, this is one of the better films of 2011, it rewards careful, thoughtful watching, and breaks from the Rocky style of sport films that have dominated the genre.",8,1,2,17 December 2011
Whip It," My 299th Review: Redefines The Term Chick Flick - And I Mean That.
","In a sense this is a 6 or 7: a kind of kookie inspirational sports movie - fun, energetic, easy to watch and easy to like.However it gets a 9 because I cannot recall any film that truly takes the conventions that male cinema does so well and wholesale translate them to something that girls will love.This film isn't sappy but it isn't about masculine heroism - it is about women having a great time being truly what they are - not 1950 prissies, but punky, spikey, ironic, sexy and just plain fun.Whip It has great roller derby sequences but more than that and more than most male sports movies we get to see the personalities of those involved and they shine.Drew Barrymore knows films - she's being doing it all her life - and this may look lightweight and simple, but the way the camera tells the story is excellent - it is all well-composed and supported by a tip-top script and a great cast. The romantic interest is too good-looking (of course) and above all this is a film that will hit the target with girls and women - but I promise you guys will really like it too.Almost impossible not to enjoy we loved its free spirit and would recommend it heartily to teenage girls as a film about doing your thing and being strong.",9,37,53,4 January 2010
Angels & Demons," Simply National Treasure for Intellectuals? A Pretty Good Straight-up Murder Mystery.
","This is a Boys' Own adventure for grown-ups pure and simple. Sure you can chuck in the mix a secret society and the Catholic Church, and that works better here than in Da Vinci, but at the end of the day this is a film with one premise: unravel some clues, defuse a bomb, and the obligatory twist. It's a watchable and enjoyable murder mystery with less of the pseudo-intellectual than Da Vinci and it really does look and feel like National Treasure for the over 30s.I was surprised at how much better the pacing and action are in this one, but disappointed at how little real sleuthing was involved. Many of the clues were solved by simply following the directions.All in all a surprisingly fun film (If fun is the right word for a murder mystery) with just enough philosophical musing amid the break-neck action and gruesome killings to justify your brain cells involvement.With excellent settings (Even though we all suspected a lot of computer wizardry) and with Ron Howard and Tom Hanks as always working well together this is good entertainment if a little popcorn.All in all: go for the plot and stay for the action.",6,1,2,23 June 2009
Black Swan," My 370th Review: More Awful Than Excellent: The Explicit Exploration Of The Subconscious Is Not A Winner
","Since the Ballet Russe and Dhiagiliev ballet has been explored on film. But not often. This is a waste, given that Merce Cuningham and The American Ballet changed the dynamic of dance and that film and ballet are both moving arts. Ballet has been explored in films like White Nights with Baryshnikov and All That Jazz, but has only been captured once truly successfully in Powell and Pressburger's stunning The Red Shoes (Which is one of THE films - whether you like ballet or not). So we were looking forward, especially after the positive reviews, to seeing Black Swan. I considered The Wrestler to be very very good indeed and while I get that they are companion pieces I did not find Black Swan to be the same rich experience.This is not the fault of Natalie Portman or an excellent cast who do give it their all.Perhaps Aaronovsky in trying to pull the same trick twice shows too much smoke and mirrors here - and by this I mean, the film's constant desire to explicitly state the tortured side through images, which the Wrestler never does. It is effective sure, but it lacks the aesthetic to bring the dark side of the dance life to more than a reduction - and what we get IS a sledgehammer to crack an egg. I have nothing about the scenes per se (and they have been discussed so much in the papers I don't need to any spoilers here) but in this reviewer's opinion they do seem a cop out for the really hard process of conveying what they convey without this chicanery. The better question is does the film lose by removing them? - In this reviewer's opinion, in all but the final 20 minutes - no, not a jot - which means they are at best a device and at worse a distraction. There is enough emotional impact in the relationships to drive the character to her final place, and the other scenes do not lend weight they simply overburden the film.The film is at its best in the dance scenes - and I don't just say that simply as someone who loves ballet - it simply is. The back stories, mother, NY bars etc; somehow don't give the weight to the creation of Natalie Portman's character in anyway the same that the dance rehearsals do, or say, the simple act of children chasing Mickey Rourke in the Wrestler did.I sense here a missed opportunity - yes, it is one of the great films about dance, but there are not that many to compare it to. Black Swan tries to imagine the complex world of pain, agony, and happiness that dancers inhabit, but in doing so it resorts to several devices that though uncomfortable are not more than effective. It is worth seeing, but I for one, and this won't be the popular opinion, cannot rave about it.All in all I was left strangely unmoved and distanced by the subplots and would wish that it had focused harder on the dance process. It is not an easy to watch, and I would not want that for one moment, but by making the internal so external it fails to achieve the pinnacle.",6,6,12,14 February 2011
Changeling," Eastwood Classic 30s True Story
","Eastwood makes great films - think of his body of work of the past ten years - both the modern and the WWII - and you get an oeuvre of work that will stand the test of time.Changeling will too. A period piece of the true story of the disappearance and the subsequent false reappearance of a son that changed California's justice system is simply powerful and in places very painful, horrific, and shocking.This is film as it should be: the filming (particularly lighting) is exemplary, the story mesmerizing and the performances are all excellent.Not easy viewing in places it is still a rewarding view in that it offers us reminders that no matter the obstacles good can come from evil.Recommended.",9,6,9,10 February 2009
Love and Death," Extends your life by 10 years and your IQ by 40 - THE comedy writer's film
","Like Mother Russia itself the themes are sweeping from death to herring - but unlike Sleeper and Bananas this is a masterwork because it leaves you wiser and wise-cracking. Beneath the wonderful silly seriousness and a veneer of intellectual mimicry is the feeling that watching Love and Death extends your life by ten years and increases your IQ by 40 points - a favourite Woody Allen, and without a doubt one of the smartest, and funniest comedies ever made.In Love and Death you get the best and fullest exposition of what Allen really did best before the the comedy of manners, or the New York settings : witty, fast, furious, hilarious, clever writing: here he proved beyond a doubt that the one-liner could be smart, and poignant.Every comedy writer (And comedy actor) should watch and learn - the timing, and the way your brain dances when watching is marvellous. A total triumph and a writer's paradise.",10,10,11,27 December 2006
Frost_Nixon," Devastating and excellent
","Frank Langhella and Martin Sheen are two actors of the absolute highest caliber and here under Ron Howard's direction they triumph.For my money this is an outstanding film of the 2008 awards season - not showy or full of effects it is simply what great cinema is all about: absolutely mesmerizing and very entertaining.Given that we know how the plot goes it's the fine detailing here - with some excellent political insights - that makes this even better.Frost/Nixon is just simply devastating - for those of us who remember the events this rings true (even in all the details like the ads and the planes etc;). Many say Ron Howard's films are too different for him to make great films, that he lacks his own style. Can I disagee? Thinking about Willow, Truman, Apollo 13, even the Da Vinci Code, Frost / Nixon does what Ron Howard does best, it reminds us of how film can inspire us and move us by telling the story clearly yet with force. I hadn't expected it to be so beyond nostalgia and emotional sentimentality and rather a real call to values.Great stuff and a surprisingly devastating watch.",10,4,7,12 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," 473rd Review: Under 25 probably your new favorite movie, over 25, not so much...
","Action! Explosion! Fight! More fight! More action! IF that's what you love then that's what'll you get. Guy Ritchie uses every camera trick and every excuse to be cool, but for this reviewer it just all turned into noise.This is a great movie if you like Batman, Spiderman style action and many do and will love this. But if you want some of that and something more then honestly the breakneck pace of this leaves no breathing room whatsoever, it's all at one pace, which may be exciting and thrilling, but it is also not very entertaining.Left feeling like my brain had been assaulted rather than entertained. Too much action not enough sleuthing and way too much editing and directing. I'm getting old. =/",5,1,4,30 December 2011
The Monuments Men," 562nd Review - Tells a tale but not as film
","Fascinating tale, great cast. Seriously one of the most interesting stories of WWII. And yet TMM is instantly forgettable. Why? Well, having spent some time thinking about its merits and faults I would say it points the camera and shoots in a way that disengages rather than involves and it doesn't really allow its actors to be more than predictable and above all the script is frankly, dull - it focuses when the viewer wants more scale, and diminishes the small stuff - it is frankly not good enough.This combination of a very straight camera style, and lack of cinematography - lighting in particularly is very straightforward - with no sense of vision for the acting makes for a very decent, even noble, but dull film. It's fault is, honestly, it is mainly bland: bland camera, bland acting, and above all, bland script.Only Cate Blanchett seems to bring some depth - everyone else has turned up and given their all but it doesn't translate. What we get is moderately exciting or interesting - and given the amazing story it really should be more.One wished this film could have been as good as the plot deserves - it is certainly watchable - but it's not the film it could have been. As you can probably tell this viewer had been really looking forward to this one, and was monumentally disappointed.",5,0,1,2 May 2014
Source Code," 426th Review: Groundhog Day goes Sci-Fi - good film to get you thinking with good thriller elements
","Source Code is one of those films where 40 minutes in your going meh, but by the end you're impressed. The premise is neat, that recreating an event over and over will lead to different results, but it's the mystery elements that carry this - and the human story that evolves that clearly lifts it from other such films.We found ourselves really walking out satisfied - and half-way through it seemed to be just the same scene over and over, but as the film develops it does truly surprise you.All in all, the concept will get you thinking what if, and the plot and the actors will have you engaged and enthralled. We were really surprised at how much we enjoyed Source Code - not bad at all.",7,0,1,11 June 2011
Skyfall," 514th Review: Glamorous, no. Different, yes. Challenging, certainly.
","After 50 years of Bond many will want Skyfall to be a cookie cutter movie of bikinis and smart weapons, quick quips, and fast cards and faster cars. And that is fun. But it is not Skyfall. In a confusing world, where cyberspace decides the fate we see Bond is a living in a grey world where good and bad are no longer absolutes - the villain (Bardem) is again much darker than any before and is a surprisingly complex character. Bond is shown deliberately not on top of his game - this is a film about the borderlines, the shadows, and reality of the spy game - well, to a certain extent, after all it is Bond, and there are a number of set scenes with motorbikes and trains that are as good as anything in any Bond film.At 2.5 hours this is easily the longest Bond film to date - and it is also a character study - perhaps we don't really want to know Bond - we want him to be a superhero and fun and not human. Here he is human and the effort shows.",7,6,16,27 October 2012
Casablanca," Magic, pure magic.... every time
","The greatest love story on film - pure and simple.The telling is so perfect: the setting, the timing, the exotic, the human.Bogart was never better, Ingrid Bergmann never more beautiful: the first time they see each other takes my breath away every time - truly one of the best moments in cinema history.Casablanca has a true timeless to it: partly because it is so beautifully shot; it is one of the most beautiful B & W films: the use of lighting, and shade are exquisite and compliment the settings perfectly.Above all, though it is a film about love: who wouldn't want to be Rick, or to be Ilsa, and to have had Paris...Exceptional, excellent, and will remain a favourite as time goes by",10,5,9,22 January 2007
In Bruges," Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are.... in Bruges
","I tell you what - life is offensive, funny, eclectic, existential, and just plain p!ssed off when you're a hit-man in Bruges.Colin Farrell plays Ray, a very bored philistine hit-man who hates his life, his conscience, and everything about Bruges. His mate Ken, an excellent Brendan Gleeson,, is more stoic, dependable, and has seen it all.What lifts this is not only the script by playwright and first time director Martin McDonagh but the deadpan delivery and wonderful sense of comradeship.Without a doubt one of the better films about hit men of recent memory - better than Matador et al - due to a stonkingly good script and lots and lots of little touches and surprises. It has real depth and polish, but it is best when it just plain vitriolic.Top drawer comedy with some action thrown in, probably not granny's cup of tea, but definitely a good film if you're in the mood.",8,3,7,16 June 2008
I'm Not There," How to peel a pomegranate...
","Without a doubt one of the better films ever about music. I think back to others that have tried before: 'A star is born', 'Saturday Night Fever', 'Coal Miner's Daughter', Milos Forman's 'Hair', 'Ray', 'Walk The Line', even 'Amadeus' , and really none take both the film and the music and fly with it the way that 'I'm not there' does.It is a powerful evocation of what Dylan means: to a generation, to a listener, to the heart. It is made with deep thought, a light touch, and great skill.What makes this shine for my money is the combination of performance and expert directorship. This is not MTV video: it looks, feels, and sounds like mature film. It elicited a response from this viewer that has been missing all year in other films, for the way it is shot, paces, framed, lit, and sounds - and was dramatically different from the usual fare that is wholly linear or retreads others' ideas.There is an aura of unique and original here and that makes it stand out clearly from the pack.The blessing of Dylan is there is so much to choose from - and therein lies the curse. Here we get the blessing: by covering the psyche and not the psychology we end up with a feast not a blow-out. Shot in a series of characters we find the different persona that Dylan foisted on the eager and not so eager public played out by a host of different actors and actresses that capture the zeitgeist near perfectly.It deserves awards and accolades. Quite simply one of the best music biography I have ever seen; and if you argue that it isn't a biography then you miss the point entirely - a beautiful, complex, and impish tribute to the man who cannot be pinned down.And why my title: well, apart from the obvious multi-faceted, you can only really successfully peel a pomegranate one way. Otherwise you end up with a sticky mess and broken seeds. But I'm not telling you how....Just left to quote Ramblin' Jack Elliot on the album 'A Nod To Bob':Happy (?th) Birthday, Bob.",10,5,10,14 December 2007
Star Trek," Good, very good, but not fantastic
","Star Trek is a great action movie - and that says it all. What could have an opportunity to make a really interesting developed series and we get great CGI and safe guaranteed winner options.The moment I knew I would like rather than love this is when Kirk says he'll make it through academy in three years, and the next moment we see the words 'Three years later' in screen. I don't know about anyone else but I would love to have seen the academy training more than another phaser being fired.This major gripe aside the best moments are those with Leonard Nimmoy who really does have a gravitas about his role.All in all, too much eye candy, and just not enough brain food. Not complaining it's enjoyable, but in a summer blockbuster way rather than in the greatness of film way...",7,1,8,9 May 2009
42," 538th Review: Best Inspirational Biopic in A Long Time
","Sports biopics, who doesn't love them? When done well they lift us all, and if they can avoid being oversentimental, they can really be the most inspirational of all movies. 42 does all of that - it is really a wonderful movie that moved this reviewer to tears four times, and just lifted my spirits.Telling the breaking of the color bar in the person of Jackie Robinson, it does two things really well - one: a great cast who all give it their all, and secondly, a ton of baseball with drama - never the easiest mix but here it works very well indeed.This is the perfect film for spring - uplifting, inspiring, and it does what all good movies can - it makes you believe the world should, could, and might be a better place.",9,0,0,2 May 2013
Argo," 517th Review: Great, solid, film that takes you with it all the way
","There is little not to like about Argo - it is made with a real sense of care, pace, direction, and purpose. From superb production values - the 70s really look right, (not just the clothes and hair, but also a wonderful lack of self-conceit), as does the Iranian Revolution - to great solid acting, a superbly sparse script, and above all, excellent directing this is a film to simply watch and be carried along.The true story of the rescue of six Americans who escape the Storming of the US Embassy in central Tehran is told with verve and great attention to detail.It is not often we see a film that scores so highly in all categories and still remains simply tenterhooks watchable - this is suspenseful, watchable, and exciting stuff - and to balance that are nice low-key performances - one of Argo's key qualities is its ability to avoid melodrama while still piling on the tension - it's a very smart balancing act.For this reviewer it certainly does stand as one of the better films of this or any year.",9,1,3,23 November 2012
The Rocker," Comedy - for laughs - not irony or sarcasm - and all the better for it.
","This was the biggest surprise of the year - bar none.A great comedy - as in laughs, feel good, and just plain enjoyable.The plot of the loser who makes good at rock'n'roll second time around is very Jack Black and Rainn Wilson does a GREAT job - there is no recourse to gross or sarcastic humor here - rather it plays on its rock roots, chucks in some stupidity, and some kick-ass tunes, and lots of excellent one liners and like I say totally surprised us as to how genuinely funny and warm-hearted this is.Great cast and a great script - sure it's not perfect, but after all the pseudo-comedy and angst of 2008 it was refreshing just to sit back and enjoy an entertaining movie.we loved it and are normally really cynical about comedies - but this rocks and would recommend to anyone as a real effort by all involved to stop being smarter than the audience and just enjoy life - in two and a half words? - it rocks!",8,44,56,28 December 2008
Public Enemies," Dummy bullets
","Mediocre, disappointing, dull.... as others have noted here there isn't much to cheer about here.I wanted a film that was at least as good as Brad Pitt's outing in the Assassination of Jesse James and with Depp and Mann one expects something special.Cruelly disappointed. Sure, I get the point that it's not a pure 100% accurate biography, that is reflects the Depression, but it just doesn't gel: we are never engrossed in the film, we are left as outsiders, and strangers at that.Despite good production values and an OK cast the plotting is weak at best and it seems the film could have been at least 30% shorter without skipping a beat. Like Zodiac it is too long, unlike Zodiac the pacing is too much the same-o same-o throughout.Probably the most disappointing film I've seen all year given those involved...",3,2,4,17 July 2009
Balls of Fury," Generic, but OK
","Loved the training sequences in this - but the rest was slightly off-kilter.The idea of taking the martial arts film and using ping-pong as its weapon of choice is a nice one and actually the strongest idea in the film. the homage to Bruce Lee films are seen throughout if you're looking - and the Chinese scenes are the best thing in the movie.Had to say the tournament just wasn't exciting enough, just not enough real sports - this only works as satire if it has moments of real heart as well as real dumbness - plenty of smart dumb ideas, but not enough heart.Pizza and beer movie - sure - just don't expect to really laugh, you will chuckle, and smile wryly though.",5,3,6,17 November 2007
Pirate Radio," Too lightweight but still fun
","This was a film I was really looking forward to - part of my growing up along with the Old Grey Whistle Test in the 70s and John Peel there was pirate radio.This is a fun film done in fine style but it appears the crew and actors had a lot more fun making this than we do watching it - it is fun and it is nostalgic, but by taking it so unseriously it actually reduces it to a so-so comedy rather than a winning film.Here was the 5th classers version of the 60s: string some scenes together, add a kicking soundtrack (A bit anachronistic as Hendrix hadn't yet recorded the track etc;) This is not a film for the real muso (And who isn't?) and everyone seems to be just doing what they do without being stretched in any way.Good good fun but so candyfloss it lacks any goodness...",6,0,3,22 August 2009
Spotlight," 571st Review - Outstanding Investigative Drama
","The story of Spotlight - the investigative team at The Boston Globe - who uncovered the abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, is told with such outstanding verve that this viewer was knocked sideways. I cannot recall another film this year that so intelligently and without melodrama produces scene after scene that just leave you wanting to know more.The all-star stellar cast is underpinned by Keaton, who seems to have proved he has had his comeback - here he focuses on a nicely underplayed performance, and Ruffalo, whose slightly off-kilter manner works to his advantage, and Rachel McAdams, who moves from romantic comedies to this with the ease and promise she showed in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. There is not a dud moment in the film - it really is one of the best films about journalism, and ranks along with All The President's Men.At the end of the day this is not just a great story, director Tom McCarthy, takes us along emotionally - but does so in such a forensic and well-judged manner that it produces a good mixture of trust and a measure of level-headedness. His script, with West Wings regular Josh Singer, is outstanding, simply the best script of the year that I can recall by quite a margin.Of all the films I've seen this year, this is the one that tackles its difficult subject with bravery, clarity, and simplicity, but it never loses sight of why it matters. I am a loss to understand why it is not on everyone's Oscar list.",10,3,5,10 January 2016
Juno," One of the best teenager comedies...
","Watching Juno is a treat - it is one of the few films that really does seem to get inside the teenager world - sure it is too smart sometimes, but in the main it really does hold true to its aim. It is one of a handful of films that made me actually remember what being a teenager was really like.With a very solid cast and a sure hand upon the helm it never loses its way - and contains lots of small details that reward close viewing.Above all, the script and Ellen Page's performance as the non-angst ridden, but cool and smart teenager that shines. For me the biggest surprise was Allison Janey and JK Simmons who are wonderful as the practical, boring, fierce, calm, and loving and utterly convincing step mom and father of Juno.This is the kind of film that will be seen as a milestone; I guarantee that it will win awards not just for being funny and fresh and having heart, but for being an important film that moves the current youth films beyond Superbad...",9,2,10,19 January 2008
Yes Man," Cute Date Movie
","Yes Man is a great date movie about letting go.Jim Carrey's mean spirited depressive get's a new attitude by saying Yes to Life - and anything else, and here balance goes out of the window in favor of some pretty cool fun.We found ourselves enjoying this as it is a clear and well-made film; the rom-com plot is just zany enough to keep you intrigued, the characters just fleshed out enough to be likable and all in all that word pretty much sums it all up: likable.It's a fun film - nothing mind-blowing, but it does leave you feeling, well, in a decidedly positive frame of mind.",7,2,3,6 January 2009
Zodiac," In a word? Bland.
","Zodiac is a complex police investigation wrapped up in a thriller.There are moments of extreme heart-stopping fear, followed by long periods of getting nowhere in the investigation.Is it a great movie? Not for my money - it is too prosaic in places, and the first hour is much better than the second.It is a good movie? Sure, if you have the time and like the genre.I went with high expectations given the pedigrees of all involved but was genuinely blanded out by the resulting film.Disappointing effort that doesn't justify the cast and cost - just not tight enough.",5,1,4,2 January 2008
Milk," Excellent and powerful biopic
","We came to this knowing little about the man, the politics, or the circumstances but by the end we were impressed.Compared to most biopics this has chops - particularly Penn's performance is not his usual tirade but far deeper and more developed - the rest of the cast are excellent and there is top-notch performances from all.We liked Milk most of all as it is a passionate and lively film. It has a sense of a story worth telling and is told well. My only gripe was that it was slightly less complex that we would have wished - everything is too linear and simplistic - but it is a minor gripe - we were certainly gripped and entertained the whole two hours.Overall, an excellent and powerful biopic and one that deserves a wide audience.",9,2,6,29 December 2008
Once," One for the Emo in all of us
","Really more an extended music video than a musical it does what you expect - it is all about the emotional journey.Shot in a semi-documentary style and using kitchen sink like acting this is honest and simple film-making; and all the better for it.The music is the pivot: strong Damien Rice type tunes that give the film a delightfully down feeling.But it the two central performances and their restrained, confused, love for each other that shines. Here, there is a real sense of gentleness, of hope, and happiness that invades otherwise pretty desperate lives.A different kind of film - it takes a while to work out the pacing, but an a one-off once works well.Sit back, relax, and chill...",6,6,12,2 December 2007
Crash," My 411th Review: Interweaving stories of race in modern LA
","I have seen Crash three times now and each time its Robert Altman approach improves - the way the stories interweave, the fact that it is addressing rather than disguising race, and the way the story impacts remains powerful and effective.Many of the negative reviewers seems to find it akin to soap opera or like a Lifetime movie; I disagree, though it does resort to some cliché in parts, the effect of the film rises above any simplistic notions of happy endings or trite messages, and tries to state and explore, nearly always with great success, the current state of race relations in the US.Did Crash deserve its Oscar, is it the best film of the year? Perhaps not, but what it is, is a brave attempt through non-linear stories, to portray a very complex issue, in a way that has not been done often before in US cinema and for that reason alone its worth the award and worth viewing.",8,0,3,6 May 2011
The Way Back," My 382nd Review: Epic without sentimentality - a better film for its straightforward approach
","Research affirms that 56 millions Soviet citizens died in the Gulags.The Way Back focuses on one story, without melodrama or fuss (and some will want it to be more an adventure film, but it is a more realistic take than that). It is serious about suffering - not in any generic horror fashion - but genuinely, how much can humans survive and are willing to survive to get to freedom. This is film-making where the plot is foremost - and what a plot. The film reveals in the first 20 seconds that plot, but takes over 2 hours to show how it is achieved.I personally came away from this deeply inspired, partly because it really makes you think that if they can achieve what they achieved, then how can I not complete any task in front of me, and secondly, because it is not glorified story-telling - it keeps it focus and keeps this pretty plain and simple - and yet it totally hypnotic.At every stage the detailing and the relationships are well done - but it is the effort that carries this to the heights - and like 127 hours you can complain that it's not full-blown production heavy filming - and you'll be right, but like 127 hours what you'll get instead, if you can let yourself become involved, an extraordinary journey that defies all sense of human effort.Well worth the effort. It is a story of the triumph of the human will and a very good watch.",9,6,10,7 March 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A Bloody Masterpiece
","This is Tim Burton's masterpiece: it is simply one of the best film adaptations of a musical ever and there is a sense that here Burton's dark vision finally cohere into something of a whole.From the onset this is marvellous: London never looked grimmer, grimier, or more gruel and gruelling. The costumes deserve an Oscar - they add significantly to the production - as does the set and lighting - a fully realised vision of a Gothic Victorian London that comes to life - there are some beautiful detailing - the vegetables in the market are grey and Gothic - and it all works to place the characters in a setting of real significance.Overall, the casting is flawless: Johnny Depp is dark, menacing, brooding, damaged, and coldly insane at both the loss of his wife, his deportation to Australia, and imbues a very real sense of revenge. He is well complemented by Helena Bonham-Carter's Mrs Lovall: a woman who really does know how to fail and obsess well; and Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin is lascivious, and evil. Timothy Spall gives a career best - I thought him even better here than Boys from the black Stuff, which is saying something - he weaves an intricate beadle, who knows his status depends on obsequious violence, and Sasha Baron Cohen is simply a turn to be enjoyed - and shows his very fine skill as giving credibility to pomposity.Yes, it's dark. Yes, it's violent - but that's its tone. The Sondheim score is amazing - never did natural speech sound so good as music - and one sees why this and Pacific Overatures, along with Sunday in the Park, reinvented the genre. True, Depp doesn't have the voice to really excel as a singer - but he brings an acting skill that I would trade much better singers for.The first hour is simply dazzling, we felt that it could have been 15-20 minutes shorter - what works on stage drags a little - but at no point does it lose its way in anyway.It is bloody, visceral, and dark - but, as we would expect from Tim Burton, it's not disgusting or repellent.Overall, it is no exaggeration to say that this is a very fine film, and an exceptional musical. With Hairspray and High School Musical is it possible we're seeing a revival? Sweeney is essential viewing, and I would not be surprised if it is a dark horse come awards time - stunning visuals, stunning acting, and stunningly sharp. Might make you want to give up shaving, or wanting pies, for a while though...Highly recommended.",10,2,6,25 January 2008
Blades of Glory," Brilliant premise... good farce
","Because men don't know how to bond anymore...You know it's a funny world when the movie with the strongest message for its audience disguises that message so brilliantly, its stupid.Blades of Glory, the story of two male rivals who become two pair skaters, is not that funny, the film is ludicrously generic, the script weak, the laughs thin (but they are there) BUT it works well as what it is: farce. Ice Skating is, obviously, a bizarre enough sport already and yes there is enough Lycra body suits to make you feel queasy -so the script goes for a healthy dose of testosterone in Ferrell's performance. I felt Ferrell performance was heading towards nonchalant and lacked the spot-on timing that made Talladega shine. Jon Heder is more on point but his character lacks a little.Jon Heder's Jimmy MacElroy is the artistic, shy teenager type, and so, of course, falls for the younger sister of the pairs' arch-rivals the bizarrely close sibling team that are the Van Waldenbergs - a sweet and fine role by The Office's Jenna Fischer, who I predict is a future star and will turn better and better - and Will Ferrell the sex-addict macho man who learns that he doesn't walk alone.My major criticism is the utter predictablitility of the plot: it feels like going out to buy new trainers, getting home , opening the box, and discovering your old trainers are in there. Guys, please don't just keep on repeating a winning formula - hero falls, journeys, retrains, discovers values, wins - over and over again: the hero plot needs some serious workover if this is the best that it can do...BUT it works for this simple reason: it does what the Western did in the 50s, or buddy movies did in the 70s, or hero and sidekick movies did: it shouts men who can be themselves and be mean 'without the gayness' as Will Ferrell's Chazz MIchael Michaels would no doubt state. In a world where men are not allowed to be men (And ice skating must be the pinnacle of all such worlds) Blades of Glory is pretty much a great movie about how men can do what women do naturally - like each other - and still be men, and remain straight, cos straight men can bond too.All this subtext is disguised on a morass of stupid, and mainly, sorry, lame humor - but if you're in the right mood it works: the achievement is that the two keep it all silly enough - and it requires no brain cells to sit back and watch - it just fails to really elevate the film to a better level by never quite capturing it title - the sport aspects of skating are not as thrilling as Nascar - these blades of glory are simply not sharp enough for greatness...",6,1,2,5 April 2007
Tangled," My 354th Review: Excellent entertainment - really
","With jaw-dropping graphics and an abundance of heart this is simply what you would wish for in a fairy tale: memorable, magical, and magnificent.We cannot remember the last time we saw a film that was simply so entertaining - there is almost nothing to complain about here in any way and much to praise from values to comedy to several scenes that were genuinely moving - this really is one of the best movies of the year and deserves its massive box office success.If perhaps you are reluctant to see it as you think it will just rehash old Disney ideas or be unsuitable for small children I would say those are always my first concerns, but here for the first time in a very long time I can honestly say that here we have a film that holds its own integrity and so, even with the villain's death, you don't feel that it was put in to scare.All in all, a magical, hilarious, witty, and very well thought through movie that deserves the Oscar that is surely coming to it - simply the best animated movie of the year as, more even than Toy Story 3, it rises beyond animation to make a wonderful heart-filled adventure that makes for very satisfying viewing indeed.Thank you, Disney.",10,29,31,9 January 2011
Pacific Rim," 551st Review: Again a Great Director Turns to Shouting And Boasting - A Dreadful Waste
","Pacific Rim is noise, color, and clash - but while the CGI takes over at every point, the movie truly fails to be anything other than PowerRangers on steroids, or Transformers in a better class - and if that's your cup of tea then no bad or balanced review is going to put you off and you'll love it.Honestly, the actors are the best robots here - the lines are flat and mostly delivered in a Marine sergeant style monotone shout that seems to be becoming the hallmark of US action films. Guillermo del Toro is a marvellous director but here he has been tempted to let his imagination be kowtowed to convention - and really this is a 1980s film with 2010s special effects.Who buys that we will all have advanced so much in 5 years? That aside, Pacific Rim is simply frustrating - a cacophony of loud noise, big fights, pseudo-emotional scenes that leave us hoping the monsters win if it puts out of our misery. I cannot deny that the effects are stunning, nor that the overall effect left me stunned and not in a good way - this is not entertainment, it is boasting - and Del Toro was never Michael Bay - but here the boasting leaves no room for film.A huge shame.",3,4,9,3 October 2013
Nightcrawler," 554th Review: The Big Sleazy
","Nightcrawler is a superb watch - the genius lies in taking all the lines they've sold us over the decade about management and work, self-improvement and negotiation, and put them into the hands of a narcissistic sociopath that is Louis Bloom. What we get is a both the snake and the snake charmer in one person - and just as mesmerizing.When Bloom gets his shot at the big time, he not only grabs it, he manipulates everyone in sight with a slick sleaze that leaves you gasping at his chutzpah. This is characterization and script with real zing. First time director Dan Gilroy gives us the slimy underbelly of TV news, where ratings have become more important than any sense of ethics - and flies with it.The film has a streak of dark humor, but more than that, it reflects the zeitgeist. In a world where TV is struggling this makes us a little too uncomfortable as we suspect it might all be possibly possible.With excellent performances and a killer script this is the thriller of the year - a nasty slice of satire that deserves its evident success.",9,2,3,13 December 2014
Burn After Reading," One for the narcissist in all of us....
","Burn is not the best Coen comedy, it has it's moments, but really it's a tale about narcissism and narcissists - and the lack of intelligence that gets you there.The plot is fun in a French farce sort of way and the characters are flawed enough to be fun too; but it's the dark side of human nature, the underbelly, those little vanities that we all contain that pushes this forward.For my money it was OK, didn't love it all, didn't hate it all, it's watchable - found the use of the F-word a little deadening after a while, Malkovitch deserves better; but all in all pretty much what you'd expect from a Coen project.Passable, but not great...",6,4,8,30 October 2008
The Last Legion," I swear I saw Xena and Hercules....
","Completely and utterly entertaining....This is really like Willow or any other action / adventure / fantasy film around. If you watched Xena or Hercules then yo've seen this. It might try to play it straighter, but really.... Fine effort is made by all - but boy you had better be watching with your cheesomatic goggles on full. Great, great fun: silly swordplay and lots of objects flying in all directions; Rome full of evil Goths and bad senators, then suddenly we're in Britain....This one is definitely for the guilty pleasure. It ain't no Gladiator or 300; more like the old 60s Sinbad films - I guarantee any eleven year old boy will love it - just don't start thinking or it'll ruin it immediately.The time flies by - and it is watchable. Just leave your thinking brain outside and you'll enjoy it. Just don't comment on lighting, direction, costumes etc; all adequate but definitely not big film: will do well on Cable / Satellite and as a New Year movie. For my money pleasant enough, but horrible if you start thinking in anyway whatsoever...Cheezy, breezy, and brain easy 5/10",5,0,1,21 October 2007
The Bourne Identity," Tip top thriller
","A very worthy addition to the Bourne series - provided that you like the breakneck pace- we found it very thrilling form beginning to end - really gripping - and a decent amount of thinking to balance some very good chase and fight scenes.The art is in the details and here the details are well thought through, it looks and feels right and just makes the time fly by.Very exciting and very watchable - just concentrate for the first 15 minutes and you'll be up and running--- the plot is complicated enough to get you involved, and the action is (mainly) feasible given Bourne's training.Highly watchable",8,2,2,16 November 2007
Baby Driver," 601st Review: True Romance meets The Blue Brothers
","Baby Driver is an extremely solid bit of filmmaking - Edgar Wright turns on both the pace and the charm as director and this is not just a beautifully crafted film, it's also a very good crime film with real chops.This has everything the moviegoer could want - top performances, a solid story, thrills but much more than those this is a very well put together film, Amos and Machliss deserve to win a ton of awards one day for their editing - the way the music and film work together is exemplary - and Bill Pope's cinematography shines - it's just a great film to watch.Baby Driver shows it's still possible to make real cinema: it blends True Romance's constant surprises with the Blues Brothers' sense of vitality, and does so without tipping into either comedy or Tarantino style violence - it makes for exceptional entertainment that puts its pedal to the metal and zips by.",7,1,3,21 September 2017
Armageddon," My 407th Review: Space Cowboys
","I saw this at the cinema when it came out and watched it again on TV when it comes round - though very good in places the overall effect for this viewer is barely passable. THe film is full of good performances and the comedy is excellent, but somehow the heroic, for this viewer, never gels, so by the end I wasn't truly caught up. I guess the fault lies in the romantic comedy syndrome: if you know he's going to get the girl how do you make the journey worthwhile; same problem here - I never, not for one second, believe that the oil drillers won't succeed.The film is surprisingly by the numbers - with huge effects a crushingly loud soundtrack, and some fun, but all in all, it will never be anything other than a boy's own adventure in space. You know those you don't recognize from the beginning are in trouble, and the one you do will be the heroes, and so on.All in all, barely passable way to turn the brain to porridge; a popcorn summer blockbuster that looks good and delivers just enough.",5,1,2,2 May 2011
Trouble with the Curve," 520th Review: Happy to go out to this ballpark
","Curve is a return to a more old-fashioned style of baseball film after Moneyball - but one that has some real acting and even a little sport's magic about it - and you can see both styles of film-making here.Eastwood is more than watchable as the old dog of a baseball scout, Adams deliveries a great performance - she pulls off the difficult role of cute and ballsy with panache, and Timberlake is charming, but definitely Wahlberg would be first pick here, Justin struggles a little to get beyond romantic comedy to something matching the gravitas the other two bring (with a light touch).The film is a wonderful relationship film with sports - not many films really look at grown father and grown daughter and work that through in mainstream cinema - Curve does, and the script is good.All in all, if you like sports with more than just the sport this is well worth your time - it is one of my favourites of the year.",8,11,17,7 December 2012
Hugo," 491st Review: intriguing but not involving enough?
","Hugo is beautifully made with some fabulous shots that show the complexity of CGI and imagination - and reconstruct in beautiful details the interior of a Paris railway station in 1930. It is a film that should be about cinema and our love of cinema, but, excepting the final twenty minutes never really engages us in that love.We sensed a lost opportunity here to create some real magic that was lost in its determination to tell the story of Hugo and not to tell the really interesting story that lies behind it. We really like the two child stars and Ben Kingsley is excellent - the fault lies in frankly spreading an idea too thin.All in all, this should be a film about why we love cinema, the art form of the 20th century so much, about how it takes us to other worlds so wonderfully, but Hugo never quite captures that sense of wonder and instead we are stuck at the station waiting for a train that never arrives.",6,2,5,11 March 2012
Wanted," Oh, so good and oh, so bad
","Definitely a great beer and pizza movie with some lazy friends on a Friday night, but a philosophical masterpiece about work, ennui, and nihilism, I think not.Look, the point is action is action and here the action is just fine. Unlike Crank, or Shoot'em up however it can't find a post modern humor to it, it just plays the action too straight and too improbable, and the word that spring to mind is bathos.However, philosophy is great only if really tight and not pop dollops of pseudo meaning - there is not enough explanation, it's all very mysterious, but simply not mystic enough.I would have liked less bullets and knives and more creativity in the action scenes - and finally at the end of the day the film can't cram in all we need to know in the time continuum provided.Good, if violent, entertainment, but a good film... uh huh.....no way.",5,104,209,23 July 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," 524th Review: Easily the best rom-com of 2012 and better than that
","SLP is a very well-judged, beautifully acted and just plain entertaining slice of rom-com. With an outstanding ensemble team thisworks - it entertains, and uncommonly for a rom-com, it makes us use our brains and not just out hearts.The two damaged protagonists are just the right side of crazy, more deeply heartbroken and mad at it than psychiatrically gone, and as we share their journey we do so taking a little of ourselves with them.This really is one of my favorite films of the year - and it stands out by a mile in the cinema as being a film about the pursuit of happiness whereas we have a decade of maudlin films this mixes the sorrow and the joy just right.SLP is worth seeing for the performances and the killer script alone, but it is how it lingers after that will get you. Good movie.",9,2,5,11 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," 505th Review: Great plot, solid filming, but above all, an outstanding female role
","TGWTDT is a great remake of a very hard to beat Swedish film - and they do pull it off. Cannot recommend the Swedish original highly enough - simply stunning - and scary. But this is faithful to the spirit and place of the original and it is mesmerizing. It is in places an uncomfortable watch, but the tale of the journalist (Daniel Craig) who is hired to solve a family mystery and restore his reputation is spellbinding.But more than that is the outstanding writing, characterization, and above all acting by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, who is a wonderfully complex and well-drawn character than easily outshines Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsgård with a knockout performance. Above all this is a female character, not some male ideal, she is vulnerable and broken, but also tough as nails and unbreakable, smart, frighteningly independent, yet searching to validate her choices, a mass of contradictions and dichotomies of the sort that actresses deserve but rarely get. It may be a gift of a role, but what Rooney does with it is a gift for us - simply the best performance by an actress, in my opinion, this year, and the best since Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone.",9,2,7,11 April 2012
The Intouchables," 513th Review: One of the Front Runners For the 2013 Oscars
","Hilarious and moving, Intouchables is simply one of the best films of 2012. Based on a true story the unlikely pairing of an immensely wealthy quadriplegic with an African immigrant carer produces line after line and scene after scene that are genuinely funny (and I mean really funny not just a gentle smirk) and also wonderfully acted.It's a hard film to fault - it isn't over-sentimental or maudlin, but it makes us care - the drama could have been deeper and more dramatic but I, for one, like that it is a genuine odd couple, buddy comedy - it is simply a pleasure to watch - I have seen it twice and enjoyed it more the second time around.It is also, significantly, one of the most affirming film about disability to date - this is not a film looking for your sympathy or tears - but neither does it gloss over or veer away from disability - but it shouts that disability is not inability or shaming - it is certainly a very strong contender for Best Foreign Film and expect to see an American version (Dustin Hoffman would be great - they are almost twins) soon....",10,3,6,20 October 2012
Ratatouille," My 334th Reivew: Even better now than when it first came out
","We have seen Ratatouille four times now and each time we love it more and more: of all of Pixar's films it is a wonderful tale of hope and talent triumphing against seemingly unlikely odds - and who doesn't love movies like that?...It remains one of the best films for dreamers that there is, and is an animated masterpiece. Every plate of food, every bottle of wine, every cooking utensil, every gesture is beautifully rendered; but not just to impress: the animation serves the story not the other way round and that is the real triumphAnd perhaps this is the point, here is originality with verve and Ã©lan, and at at the end of the day Ratatouille remains one of the best animated films of all time. It really is a treat for anyone who loves life.",10,0,1,22 August 2010
Goon," 494th Review: One of the best, the very best, sport comedy out there
","This is a lot smarter than some reviewers are giving it credit for - it's tough, even nasty on the ice, but seriously not only laugh out loud, but it's also a wonderful inspirational film that both moved and surprised this reviewer.Full of great performances, especially Seann WIlliam Scott and Jay Baruchel (who co-wrote) and Liev Schrieber, the surprise though is Kim Coates, who with over 40 films to his credit, is a well-known face, but here is seriously the most realistic coach I've seen on film in a while.If you like sports movies you should love this, yes it is raw in the fights and the language, but that's where a lot of the real laughs come from - but what makes this really worth watching is that it's about the unsung hero, the underdog, the loser finding love, finding a home, and I for one loved every minute of it.",10,11,14,15 March 2012
No Strings Attached," My 404th Review: Pretty cute date movie
","This has spark and wit and good performances, and was all in all, a good grown-up romantic comedy. The leads show good chemistry with Natalie Portman playing the more male traits against Ashton Kutcher's ready to commit male.The plot of two adults who think they're only in it for the physical and then discover more is fin and feisty, with a solid supporting cast including Kevin Kline playing Aston's father.All in all if you like your romantic comedies with a little bit more bite, but not too blatant, then this is not a bad choice. It's fun to see both leads using their good comic abilities and all in all this is a fun night out.",7,0,3,26 April 2011
The Duchess," Excellent costuming, BUT Knightley is not the actress for this
","Fantastic settings: Althorp, Chatsworth, Bath etc; amazing budget on costumes - without a doubt the best since Sophia Coppola's Marie Anotoinette - and a feast for the eyes with it's detail for Georgian times.However, and it's a huge however, no matter how great the production values, and this looks pretty expensive, nothing can disguise the fact that Knightley is beautiful but fails to be more than than a good actress. She is not a great actress. This may be an unpopular comment, but in the scenes with Rampling or Fiennes she lacks depth. As a young ingénue thrust into a marriage she is perfect; as the most political women of her day who found herself in probably the most famous triangle before Prince Charles, not so.She is in no way bad, and this is watchable, but it is not brilliant. It is a great shame. Knightley must find a way to really convey the smallest gesture to mean more. She loses her temper reasonably well, but not completely. One senses there is no madness, it is all too self-conscious and shows too much control. One gets the sense that she is an actress, but not a fully developed one.We enjoyed this, but my wife's comment on The Duchess was the same as mine: looks brilliant, lacks power.",6,4,6,2 January 2009
No Country for Old Men," Simply the best thriller of the year
","'No country' is a beautiful and tense thriller. This is not just a simple plot of man finds money, gets into a whole bag of trouble as a result.There are a number of elements that lift it out of the ordinary: exceptional dialog, characterization, and filming.For me, it was impossible not to be swept along by the surprises and the overall melancholy of the piece.What lifts this so hugely out of the ordinary is a clever trick: the characters are all slow, thoughtful, philosophical, even existential - but the action is fast, violent, and the combination produces a thriller of a very high class indeed.Tommy Lee Jones gives, I believe, a career best: laconic, hang-dog, the sheriff who is not fazed by anything. Javier Badern plays a psychopath with no limbic pathway whatsoever - he just hasn't a human emotion in his body - and yet his own logic is impeccable. Just like the poster suggests, and the Coen Brothers want, he lingers on and a superb cinematic figure.Rather like 'Paris, Texas' even the desert and its surroundings are a major character here; and the film is brilliant at marrying both the landscape and the moment into one. But above all it is the story and the way that it's delivered - marvelous performances from all the leads and minors, tense action, and even humor, and above all a sense of uncertainty as to where we were going next.Never boring, and a superb plot, never wrong-footing itself this is, without a shadow of a doubt, simply the best thriller of 2007.Absolutely recommended.",10,0,6,28 December 2007
Bridesmaids," 451th Review: Rude, Crude, and Seriously Laugh out loud funny...
","Bridesmaids is the funniest straight-up comedy that this viewer has seen for a very, very long time. Sure, it's rude & crude, with a sentimental side, and it's all delivered with such verve that it triumphs.The plot is exactly what the title says - Bridesmaids, and every one of them is portrayed well (We really liked Melissa McCarthy, know from the Gilmore Girls and Mike & Molly, who gives it 100% - she is the OTT character and rather than nauseate she brings her wonderful energy to this and it works). Director Paul Feig, best known for TV comedies The Office and Freaks and Geeks does a really nice job.There is scene after scene of laugh out loud lines, and we can't remember the last time a comedy made us laugh this much, instead of just smile. Bridesmaids is definitely not just all focused on sex and relationships, there's a good measure of life in there too. The situation comedy is nearly as sharp as the lines and generally work well - it's the wit in the script and the comic timing that really makes this though.Honestly, if you coped with American Pie there is nothing worse here - and for my money this there is an honesty about being female, single, and over 30 that makes this more than just the laugh-fest it is.A funny and fun film with a great ensemble cast that you'd have to have missed the last 20 years to find offensive - made us laugh....a lot.",9,0,3,6 September 2011
The Chorus," A lark ascending...
","This is a film to make the soul sing.A new warden, Clément Mattieu, (Gérard Jugnot) arrives at an 'internat', what is to all extent and purposes a borstal, to find boys out of control and a sadistic head (jean-Paul Bonnaire). Clément begins a choir and small changes begin...'Les Choristes' is a marvel - here there is little posing and much poise - all the parts are well done, especially Jugnot and the children. they seem to have gathered the most natural group of children I have seen in a long time. Their acting reminded me of Danny Boyle's Millions - though that is a modern fable it has much the same effect - but 'Les Choristes' has not one dud scene it.The time flies by watching this - as things get desperate then better. Of course, the music is wonderful, and the part of Pierre Mohange (jean-Baptiste Maunier) is beautifully played. The pacing is perfection, nothing is rushed, and we are left to understand the utter misery as well as the joy here for all along the way - it is not a fairytale - though it does lift the soul wonderfully by its endThis is only director Christophe Barratier's second feature film and is extremely impressive on that basis.Highest recommendation. Immensely charming, and very watchable.",10,5,5,31 December 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," The cinematography alone is breathtaking
","I watched El Cid last week and Lawrence this week and you could not see two more different films: both may be about heroism but one is old-fashioned, theatrical, and exploding with action and color; the other is an extraordinary canvas of film filled with simple, devastating images that invade and linger, that takes its time and creates some of the best shots on film.From a technical viewpoint Lawrence is extraordinary, it really does look and sound and feel like it was made now. The film looks fresh, there is none of the artificial colors of films prior to Lawrence: it is truly a masterpiece of film and one that deserves a very special place in film history.I firmly believe that David Lean changed film: films after Lawrence are simply more lifelike more real less theatrical less acted, but are also more carefully shot, with the color and lighting far more subdued and real.Of course, Lawrence, is also about heroism, character, and a unique individual: but it is in the combination of both the film and the story that the film's greatness lies.Simply stunning.",10,1,4,25 March 2008
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," 442nd Review: Good but not great summer blockbuster
","TROTPOTA is a CGI led fest that while good in development asks for major suspension of belief in the last 40 minutes: from the ape facility we suddenly get literally over 120 apes pouring into the streets and they seem to multiply every second on screen - it lost a huge amount of feasibility for us there. How do we get from 1 gorilla to 8, 10 orangutans suddenly pop-up etc; Are there really 200 apes in the Bay Area? Nitpicking maybe but it really loses major credibility.Likes: the apes' intelligence is well explained, and the body language etc is excellent Dislikes: the climax scenes though good lack credibility and weaken the film.All in all a reasonably good summer popcorn blockbuster, but for this review, and I bet this'll be the unpopular opinion, why should it be about science then expect us to suspend our logic - it ruined a great film.",Null,0,5,6 August 2011
Behind The Candelabra," 541th Review: OK, we get that it's a good performance & well directed, but the middle 40 minutes are stupefyingly boring....
","BTC is not a likable film - it may have performances that required hard work to carry off, and capture the excess, but it is about as deadening from minute 45 - 65 - a third of the film - as it'll possible to be - a good first third, and a good last 15 minutes are destroyed by the absolute meanderings of an expansive middle.It's exploration of the relationship is done in a high camp style - it's all about glitter and sex, and the film makes both protagonists out to be performers 100% of the time.Though it does capture much of the camp of LIberace it is still a pretty boring view - it's not that we can't or don't want to connect with the characters - it's that everyone is trying so hard to convince us of the weirdness that overreaching and overacting take over at every stage. I just couldn't find any enjoyment in it - and was massively bored in the middle.",5,1,6,14 June 2013
Get Out," 600th Review: As Lingering and Effective As You Would Want It To Be
","Get Out is full of touches and surprises, strong acting, excellent direction, and above it, it's a ride, a trip to a place Hollywood doesn't normally go - it offers a unique experience - and in this age of copycat, cookie cutter safe choice cinema, it stands out by a mile.Get Out is that rare beast - a film that leaves you satisfied yet pondering. We objected to its constant referral as a horror film - it's an effective thriller with mild horror elements - but it is not a gore/slasher movie - this is more about getting under the skin, and inside the mind, of the viewer.The plot is simple: girlfriend takes boyfriend home. Home is not what home seems to be. Fun ensues. The genius of this is the way it plays on both white and black perceptions - we asked how the film would be if you reversed all the roles (pretty darn effective) etc;Get out and see it.",9,88,178,29 April 2017
Bolt," Good entertainment if a little complicated
",Bolt is surprisingly complex and involving. I expected to take the kids and then sleep but I enjoyed it more than them - the kids are very bright but still found the idea of a superdog who isn't a superdog but still thinks he's a superdog a little too much...However by the time Bolt gets to New York that was all sorted out and they enjoyed the movie - especially Rhino the Hamster who was funny.Good animation throughout and lots of adventure and excitement make this easy viewing (I'm not convinced it is really worth an Oscar nomination though) there is a lot to see and take in but we were surprised at how developed the plot was.All in all a fun movie with some good moments!,6,1,4,31 March 2009
The Lives of Others," Who's listening?
","It is rare to see a film that is so totally convincing as Das Leben der Anderen.The movie focuses on Stasi agent Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), and the wiretapping of Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a famed author, and actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). The whole film from the architecture to the furniture is beautifully bought to life.But much more than that is the sense of menace through the banal that the film draws you into.Extraordinary performances by all involved, wonderfully understated and suppressed and controlled, and the overall washed-out tones add to the surreality of a world whether you are either a listener or listened to.A perfect paranoia for all involved the film unfolds and builds with a tremendous sense of pace. For a film this long it is beautifully handled.Of course, the film is about the need for freedom, but that sells it way short; perhaps, it is more truthfully a film about good in unexpected places.Definitely deserves its Oscar: one of the outstanding films of German cinema, and for my money the best German film since Das Boot and Run Lola, Run.Hugely recommended.",10,5,6,1 January 2008
Schindler's List," 500th Review: Simply the greatest historical movie ever made
","Schindler's List is almost too painful to watch - a remarkably subdued but traumatically powerful account of the greatest evil ever perpetrated by mankind. I can't watch it without weeping, not just crying, but every time, I just weep. Spielberg sets aside all sense of melodrama and instead gives us not only remarkable characterization in Oskar Schindler, Amon Goeth, and Itzak Stern, but also brings an enormous sense of humanity and dignity to an almost impossible subject. I cannot begin to say what it was like to see this for the first time in the cinema the week it was released - it was simply the greatest film I had seen - it truly captures something about human dignity and hope as well as evil and complacency that go beyond words.I could write about the magnificent production, and filming, grading, editing and care - but above and beyond this there is just the power of the true story - that one man did make a difference is almost impossible to comprehend given the odds and given the circumstances.Cinema at its very very best can capture both the reality and the hyper-reality in a way that no other art form can - Schindler's List does - and it remains a living testament and the most powerful reminder that we all can and must choose good over evil. Schindler's List remains for me one of the greatest, if not the greatest, film I have seen and I always knew it would be my 500th review. Thank you Steven Spielberg, and I hope it will serve always as a reminder why courage and good really matter.",10,9,14,26 March 2012
Stardust," Absolutely charming and much better than expected
","Compared to Pirates this has a definite edge: wonderful story, great acting, real issues and time to create wonder, thought, and amazement: above all it was just really sweet and charming when it should be, and dark when that was called for.With a great cast - it is good to see Clare Danes back in action, and Michelle Pfeiffer - this is far and away one of the most original and entertaining films of the year.It is clearly well-made, well thought out, and a winning movie.It is NOT a children's film - there are moments which would clearly frighten youngsters, but for teenagers and older definitely recommended.",7,3,5,16 November 2007
Kick-Ass," My 325th Review: Way OTT film for the fans of fast freaky fun....
","A lot of reviewers here are more concerned about others morals than just simply enjoying a film for what it is - if they went in expecting a superhero movie and didn't like le théâtre du grand-Guignol approach should have done their research.This is not a film for dose whose only knowledge of comics and superheroes comes from knowing who and not what Spiderman, Superman are. This is a movie for those who know and have read Sandman and Mus, it's for those whose sense of irony and action is more in the Shoot'Em up, Wanted mould. I didn't find it that 'violent', though it is, but it is as I said Guignol rather than action thriller, there are OTT bullets and knives aplenty around by the end.The first half is really just about ordinary guy who dons a costume and messes up, but it is the second story of the cocaine mafia and Hit Girl that completely takes over and triumphantly steals the show.This reminded more of the Tick than Superman, it is about a YouTube, Fark generation and it is fun, funny, and hip.Not perfect by any means it is the best action film around at the moment and it full of self-irony and nods to a bunch of post-modern sensibilities.All in all, surprisingly both stupid and intelligent, and well, just plain fun...",8,2,10,8 May 2010
Unknown," 422nd Review: OK thriller, nothing super special though
","While not quite cookie cutter Unknown is nothing we haven't seen before. Having said that Liam Nilsson does a nice job as the man whose memory had gone south.All in all, it was not bad, but apart from an excellent car chase there was little here that really jumped off the screen and made it memorable.If you like thrillers with some action then you're going to like this: it suffers from the fact that it takes its central idea of a man who is without identity and wears it thin without much more - when it gets into the action it does liven up.All in all, nothing special, but good competent thriller.",5,1,4,25 May 2011
Gran Torino," A thoroughbred shows hip chops
","Clint Eastwood is, of course, the Gran Torino - the 1972 classic that just gets better with age. In 1972 Eastwood was the young blood with the mostest - the Man's man - drifting and shooting his way to Megastardom - here he is again giving a masterclass in what a small film can achieve, and still teaching his message of male values.If Steve McQueen had lived you would had to have given him this role - he would have been perfection - but here Eastwood has a magnificent growl as the impossibly old and just too red blooded Polack.(His term) Gran Torino is a mixture of current realism, some very good comedy, and 70s hard-edge neighborhood films that juxtapose well. You can see many levels and metaphors here, but in the end it's just the story-telling shines through.It would have been a really interesting (But impossible?) film to make with a Muslim neighborhood, but hey, I guess we'll have to wait another 30 years until we're all ready for that one! Enjoyable on many levels - but most of all for the balls out performance by Eastwood who is tougher and yet more together than all the action heroes half his age.Gran Torino is not Die Hard or Charles Bronson as Paul Keirsey in Death Wish - this is a drama film with action, not an action film with drama - there is some real acting chops here and a great dose of real humour, particularly from the young Asian cast.Of course, this film is just part of a growing trend towards the graying of Hollywood - but it truly is a cross-generational film about the values that mainstream America is losing - and an interesting film about bridging both the generational and the racial divides.",8,0,2,1 January 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A masterwork and feast for the eyes, but a disappointment for the heart...
","Benjamin Button is a stunning triumph if you judge it on its special effects alone. Simply great. Make-up, CGI, attention to historical detail etc -- great.While the story is a very intriguing one the actual execution is good, not great - the performances are fine, but the whole project doesn't reach the heart as one would wish.I am not saying for a moment that you shouldn't watch Button, it is entertaining - but, it is not a GREAT film, I am pleading that major studio films be prepared to make their films more challenging or charming; there is a severe lack of both brains and, more seriously, charm here (Gump which this loosely resembles had oddles of charm) : the result is just too bland and most of all it lacks charm to be great.It will almost certainly win Oscars for its effects and make-up (Or perhaps TDK will take that? It should win for costuming - excellent. But it should not win for Best Picture.In conclusion: the look and design of production are not enough if at the end of it all of it leaves us unmoved.",7,0,3,30 December 2008
Wimbledon," A Grand Slam Of Tennis, Romance, And Heart
","This is a real fun movie to watch when you want to cheer, cry, and just feel great - lots of love, and lots and lots of tennis - all the actors are right for their roles with Bettany outstanding as the recalcitrant over-the-hill journeyman player who get a second lease of life when he fall in love with fellow tennis pro, Kirsten Dunst. All in all, this is much much better than most romantic comedies - the sporting angle really is brilliant and it really is a film about tennis rather than just a situation comedy. It's even got lots of John McEnroe doing the running commentary.Surprisingly moving and very funny this was one of our favorite films of the year.Recommended!",9,3,4,12 August 2009
Children of Men," A new 1984: An under-rated masterpiece and an important piece of cinema
","In settings, cinematography, sound, lighting, casting, and above all, directorship this is mature film-making. The triumph is two-fold; firstly, it is remarkably low-key and refuses to shout its stunning credentials; it does not hit you over the head, but rather invites you to be the camera's eye, and secondly, none of the huge amount of detailing detracts from an unbelievably assured storyline; and the detailing shows in every shot. And it is the visual surprises that linger; just trying to take in the detailing in every shot is a delight; the faces and crowd-work, the graffiti, the modelling and styling of cars, architecture etc; the interiors are extraordinary in every setting, and the future touches are subdued and understated. In the action sequences I have never seen or heard better bullet squibs: a totally different experience from the normal pumped-up ubereffects. Only wardrobe and hairstyling jerk us back too fast to where we are coming from. What is evident is a huge amount of love, care, and creativity has gone into the production design - and the production teams should get great work from this.Cuarón captures a zeitgeist about fears of the political now and pushes it into a future that echoes our subconscious. I would hesitate to get preachy here and call it political satire directly, but you need look no further than Orwell and Bradbury for a suitable frame of reference. Though the pacing, story-telling, and look and feel certainly do not weigh down the film in any way: it is hugely enjoyable.Is it a great film? What makes film great? Not that they made you laugh, or cry, or think; or even captured the zeitgeist. Rather, they linger. They invade the senses, and touch that part of us that we forget exists now and then...We came away inspired and talking about how the film is a in a very real and powerful sense a call to ourselves: what world do we want? Are we so afraid of each other in other countries and cultures? What world do we want for our children to inherit? We loved it: exciting, moving, and original.One of the best films of the decade so far. Go see.",10,2,5,18 January 2007
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A different approach
","I hope they will always, but always, make films about the worst crime that human being have ever imagined against each other.The Holocaust is a difficult subject and here we get a different approach: an eight year old moved away from his friends, as his father becomes commandant of a concentration camp, is left friendless and bored.He explores and befriends through the barbed wire a Jewish boy - and it their friendship that is the film's fulcrum.As with most BBC productions the production values are excellent, and it looks and feels right, especially the Bauhaus.The last 15 minutes are very moving and well done and the rest of the film builds well; though the mother's sympathies were unrealistic in the main and we thought it would have been stronger if she had been different.All in all a good film approaching a very difficult subject and moving in a different way.",7,1,2,25 January 2009
Ip Man," Without question, one of the best, if not the best, kung fu biographies ever...
","Grandmaster Ip man is simply a superb and inspirational biographical movie about the father of modern Chinese martial arts.Shot in a modern style but embodying all the virtues of The Good Chinese Hero of Confuciansim this is a really marvelous and very good watch.The film is made by the exceptional performance of Donnie Yen as grandmaster Ip. Yes, the fighting skills are exceptional - though this is in places more explicit that many earlier fantasy kung fu movies and younger viewers should be made aware of this - but more than this Yen gives the role a true and very deep and abiding sense of stillness, dignity, and gravitas.From its beginnings, which are much lighter in tone, to the Japanese occupation, which are not, (And the Japanese here are best thought of as Nazis) the story intrigues and moves along with a wonderful sense of pace - nothing is rushed but a real sense of build-up exists.This is a masterful blend of Western styles of cinema - it is exceptionally well-lit and shot with superb grading on the film - and Eastern love of the hero story. The fight scenes are all exceptional with a real sense of mastery and vision - without resorting to either too much slapstick or out and out violence. In places the moves are simplicity personified and all the more stunning as a result.If martial arts are your thing you will absolutely love this - but if drama rather than action is also your thing - then I guarantee you will walk out a foot taller.Moving, exciting, and inspirational - an exceptional movie.",10,2,4,17 May 2009
Here Comes the Boom," 525th Review: Huge surprise -James finally makes very good indeed
","This has real charm, motivation, comedy, and a superb Henry Winkler and Selma Hayek - and a very good Bas Rutten as the coach who will be getting a ton of work based on this - all in all this is a surprise from beginning to end - and James finally seems to have learnt to rein it in and learnt that OTT all the time is just deadening.So, a confession - Mall Cop, not my favorite movie, just OK, the one at the zoo, definitely not my thing (or my kids), so I had very low expectations indeed going in to see Boom - but what a difference! The plot is simple: loser teacher seeks to raise school funds by becoming a MMA fighter. And it works. The surprise is how inspirational this is - the school aspect is a really smart move - and totally lifts the movie.If you want a pizza movie you could do much much worse, this is a well-made, well-judged, and fun movie. One strongly suspects that James found a character he could totally connect with and it gives him what he does best - heart.",8,37,48,18 January 2013
Clash of the Titans," My 338th Review: The PERFECT film for an eleven year old boy...me, not so much
","This truly is the best movie ever if you're aged between 10-13 - Greek heroes, mythical gods and outrageously OTT monsters, beautiful heroines and heroes aplenty you couldn't ask for better or for more: it's a combination of Space Troopers and 300 with some LOTR.But for me as an adult it was deadening: seeing some of the best actors this side of the Atlantic (British, Irish & Dane) all spewing lines in a way that didn't fit their style at all, and the beauty of Greek mythology reduced to a couple of sentences and two or three massive set scenes replacing any need for film with Transformer style action left us dull and deadened.As I say, great boys' film, seriously, but as a great film - not a chance.",5,0,1,1 September 2010
The Dark Knight," Letting the terrorists win, very, very ugly film-making that belittled my soul...
","I don't care about the acting or the effects or whatever. Not matter how ... brilliant... uh-huh...Dark Knight is just so completely devoid of any compassion from anyone; it's like watching computer euthenasia. There isn't an ounce of anything equating to a human emotion here. I wasn't afraid. I wasn't entertained. I was just depressed.If this is the best film of 2008 then films have become a way to feed the worse of the human spirit.Ooh, but it exciting, and ooh isn't the Joker a real baddie.When you leave a film just plain bemused at how so many people can buy into this, I for one was definitely not entertained.If you love this then wow yippee....To me it's just ugliness, and really horrible vision of a world where the terrorists always win.And if you find that great entertainment, then what will top this, what more do you want next time? Sorry, just found it all thoroughly horrible. Really.",1,33,71,22 August 2008
Friends with Benefits," 449th Review: At best when sparking...
","FWB tries to be a pastiche of romantic movies and, inevitably, ends up being exactly what it's sending up.THe first 25 minutes are simply excellent - witty, fast, furious, and fun. However, it totally runs into cliché territory and not in a good way.There is plenty of spark between the leads and a great supporting cast, but not even they can rescue this by the end. It is harmless and good fun, but given the excellent promise of the first half hour you are left cruelly disappointed by the end. Sure it's a romantic comedy, and a good one, but this is not as new or as innovative in any way.Enjoyable, sure, but nowhere near the promise of its excellent beginning.",6,0,1,1 September 2011
The Greatest Game Ever Played," My 11th Review. On the Scorecard: Dignity, Poise, and Great Heart
","If you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then this'll work for you big time. Oversentimental in places? Sure, of course it is - and proud of it. It is the biggest and best ride in the Carnival and should be enjoyed as that. Big production values, simple telling, with creative shots: it is not complex, is a very nice and remarkably sweet film. It really feels like a labor of love from Bill Paxton; and I bet his son gets that.The build-up is slow enough to be enjoyed, the conflicts feisty, and the British vs. Americans handled with a degree of vaudevillian villainy, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always to the fore. I have minor gripes: the score wants to be James Horner but is too overblown, and there are too many close-ups, and panning shots for 2005, but if you want a straightforward, decent, and good-looking sports film then this is it.So here's the thing, and I feel like I know my film, but I actually liked it more than Seabiscuit: which is a better film, but Greatest Story is simply Disney at its core and hugely enjoyable! Thanks, Bill.",9,0,1,19 December 2006
Taken," Straight up a good action movie with a good theme
","Sometimes old fashioned just works - yes, this could have been made in the 80s with Mel Gibson, but darn, it really is immensely entertaining.A sordid plot of kidnapping and the sex trade is well done - it gives the film real depth - and is actually a very well-made part of the film - it adds a drama element that gives real depth to what is otherwise a popcorn action thriller.It is slow initially but gathers pace then when it gets going it just doesn't stop - and the action is well done.A good turn by Liam Nilson (My wife hated his fake hair color though) and the supporting cast - it's all pretty much what you'd expect and it is very watchable.I'm giving it 8 because the time flies by and because of the drama elements - very watchable and a good blend of spy skills and straight out hard-nosed action.",8,1,2,11 January 2009
Alice in Wonderland," My 330th Review: Lots to admire, little to love
","Alice is clever, but it's not in the least bit fun in the way the book is: it lacks any real sense of lyricism and poetry, any sense of a light touch and subtlety that would makes the darkness intriguing and what we end up with is a mess; and a very contrived mess at that.As an exercise in computer wizardry it excels, but Tim Burton of all directors was never about the technology and all about an extraordinary Adventure: here the Adventure is more Action than Acting. We were left exhausted and deadened senses and so numbed that our souls were empty....We wanted to love this: it has a weirdness to it that is intriguing but at 1hr and 48 mins it felt twice as long, everything is at a ludicrously fast tempo - never a great sign - and above all, it allows the special effects to tell the story not the other way round.I say again, lots to admire, little. if anything, to love.",4,0,2,28 June 2010
Avatar," My 294th Review: Meh...
","This will win a truckload of prizes, and Roger Ebert compared it to watching Star Wars, and he does know what he's talking about, so why couldn't we get that feeling too?We enjoyed the spectacle but weren't moved. It's an huge film in that it is serious eye candy but when my heart and mind are not left on Pandora isn't it an empty feast? It may be the biggest and most spectacular blowout at the movies (And the 3D was good) but is this really the best film of this or any other decade?The anthropologists did an OK job but I never really got under the skin of the culture and so what we get is just about a retelling of a Man Called Horse and the Native Indian experience.All in all, fun, but for us it lacks that special feeling that makes the spectacle into a great experience...RE-EDIT: I have just watched the BlueRay DVD and enjoyed this much more: I hadn't realised how much darker a film looks in 3D on the DVD the colors explode and the whole thin comes to life - really enjoyed it this time. Still not classic, in my opinion, but what an improvement!",7,5,14,23 December 2009
Selma," 557th Review: King's Indelible Legacy - Marching To Today
","Selma is a magnificent, inspiring, and massively watchable film that does not shy from the politics or from showing King as a man. Above all, though, this is the film that bothers to take its research very seriously. As many of us, I have studied in depth the Rights Movement. The attention to historic detail, without glorification or hagiography is commendable. The attempts to use actors that look like the person they portray, excellent, and the tone and mood of the film is a truly fitting depiction.The Civil Rights movement took the impetus and teachings of Gandhi (King traveled to India and stayed in Ashrams in 1959 in order to understand NVDA) and coupled that with the true spirit of Southern Baptism - and found their leader in King.There has been nothing like Attenborough's Gandhi for King. Partly because of internal rights (and it is too complicated to explain here, but worth research) and partly because other attempts have not captured the true spirit of both sides. Where Selma succeeds massively is that it captures deeply what both sides believed in - the incredible bigotry is shown as is - the film shows that morality, justice, and the dignity of men lies in justice and fairness and that such freedoms are worth all; then and now. This is a film that inspires young and old people and reminds us all that we can do and do better.Selma is a clear and sincere historical account of the events of late summer 1965 that would lead to LBJ enacting the Vote Act - it is powerful tribute to one of the most important events of 20th Century American history.",10,7,19,16 January 2015
Invictus," My 295th Review: World In Union
","As someone bought up on rugby and a strong anti-apartheid supporter - and those two things could go together - I was always going to love this.With Eastwood at the helm we get a wonderful performance from Morgan Freeman, who really dominates this film, and a very solid performance from Matt Damon, who obviously took his rugby training very seriously.This is a film whose central theme is inspirational leadership - Mandela had that wonderful ability to inspire people with his humility and drive - and this is bought out wonderfully.This is a great film to simply enjoy - it is at its heart a film about inspiring a people through both sport and healing a nation - and Eastwood captures that.This film deserves to be a real success in those countries where rugby is still a major sport, but deserves a much wider audience - it's a great film for anyone who enjoys an inspirational sports movie and good politics and is a glimpse of the best that humans can achieve when inspired to do so...",8,2,3,23 December 2009
Rio," My 410th Review: Great theme, but maybe not for the smallest kids?
","Rio is brash, colorful, bold, and bouncy full of energy and drive and great characterization. It is a terrific theme: animal trafficking and embraces a very strong Eco message that is just wonderful.However, and it is a really big however, our kids did not enjoy it, for them the character of the baddie bird Nigel, is, without spoilers, just too much; they were just frightened and even though they like a little, this was too scary for them. At six, you'd think it'd be OK, but they just found it too much and it really ruined it for them.I guess this will work best with the tweenies - it's a shame the music and the humor are all good - and the fact that this is a real green movie is terrific; but I'll not be buying the DVD of this one.",5,4,9,6 May 2011
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," My 406th Review: Emotive, emotional account of two brothers and the early day of modern Eire
","TWTSTB is not a difficult film to simply like or admire: it deals with a sensitive subject - the control and abuse by the British of Eire in 1922, the handing over under the Dublin Accord, and the subsequent civil war that occurred.Rather than going big and sweeping Ken Loach with his normal panache chooses to focus on one family and one community - and the film is better for it - here we get the moral conflict and the hope for a better future through independence. Ken Loach pulls no punches in depicting the English as arrogant pigs who abuse the locals and their power and show no respect or attempt to befriend anyone: they are cruel, vicious, and sadistic from the off. As nearly all the major critics have pointed out, it's nigh on impossible to see this without drawing analogies to the contemporaneous Iraqi situation - stop and searches, random snatches, even language barriers; however this is a film is that is very much about Ireland and its identity and its values.Beautifully shot, with excellent production values throughout, the story is compelling, and keeps up a cracking pace throughout - a mixture of action, drama, and politics - it is both uncomfortable viewing, but in its own way, mainstream too.It really is a film about what price freedom, true freedom and democracy takes - and as an account of history it is excellent.Ken Loach is not afraid to be honest, and to challenge our comfort zones. This film won the Palm D'or at the Canne Film Festival for good reasons - worth seeing in every way.",8,0,6,2 May 2011
Limitless," 421th Review: Competent but wastes a brilliant idea
","Limitless is one heck of a great idea for a movie: a pill that instantly makes you super-smart - and the film is, as others here note, fast, fun, and all-in-all not bad per se.My objection may seem irrelevant to the finished film but why take such a brilliant idea and reduce it to a) a thriller and b) a movie where the hero does nothing except satisfy his own selfish ends.Seriously this film lacks all sense of moral vision, really given super-intelligence would you not see some of the bigger problems and how to cure them would you really just go give me money, lots and lots and lots of money....All in all, an OK thriller, but given the elegance and brilliance of the concept a lightweight effort indeed...",5,3,5,24 May 2011
Les Misérables," 523rd Review: Mostly perfect....
","Do I love the stage musical? - a huge resounding yes! Les Mis is easily my favorite musical of the past 30 years - and I really know it inside and out - so like many I've been on tenterhooks waiting to see the big screen version. And it is great - mostly.The story of Jean Valjean, a victim of heavy justice who discovers redemption and his journey that finally leads up to the barricades of a Paris student uprising in the late 1820 is told with verve and assurance.It is moving and well done. The younger cast in particular shine with heart and vigor. (I did have a problem with two songs that were absolute showstoppers on stage and both were curiously underwhelming in this reviewers opinion.) All in all, this is a unique and interesting interpretation and as nearly everyone else has noted it is not a straight from stage to screen adaption that tries to reimagine the soliloquies and internal dialogs in a far more intimate way.Considering it was the film I was most looking forward to it was a great experience....mostly....",8,4,7,11 January 2013
Thor," 448th Review: better than most and Brannaugh does an excellent job
","This could have been the new Flash Gordon - cheesy and frankly bad, but with Ken Brannaugh in charge we get a film that frankly is one of the better superhero films. Brannaugh is best known for Shakespearean theater, and Shakespeare on film, as well as Mozart's Magic Flute; and it is perhaps these very qualities that carry the fantasy sections so well.Thor, son of Odin, attacks the Norse gods enemies without permission, and is exiled to Earth, where he meets an astrophysicist (Natalie Portman). PLotting is get simple, but not simplistic, and the fact that we can follow the story clearly at all stages again says much for the director.All in all, this is a very successful film: exciting, interesting, and surprisingly intelligent. We enjoyed it a lot.",8,0,1,30 August 2011
The Departed," Screams Oscar!
","Extraordinary performances from the absolute best cast of 2006.A character driven maelstrom.Amazingly fluid, visceral, gripping,powerful, real, honestHas it received too much praise?No. For my money, and without a doubt, the best character driven movie of 2006.Why? Because I simply go to the dark heart of the human condition, betrayal, trust, loyalty, honor, dishonor, and the nature of each and in that it leaves the herd behind. Wahlberg (awesome), Sheen, Baldwin, Damon, Di Caprio, and Nicholson (just forgivable grandiose) ARE real - even when the situations seem overblown. An immense feeling of absolute immersion that moves it from another film to something better. Impossible to imitate: though many will try. Topping this should be interesting Marty!",10,2,5,29 December 2006
The Holiday," Unashamedly old-fashioned romantic comedy
","The Holday is the perfect cure for your winter blues. A lively fun film that does precisely what it says on the packet - it brings out the Christmas romantic in all of us. My wife and I cried and laughed and knew it would all work out - of course.Grown-up enough to make you feel awake, and romantic enough to make you cry, laugh, and sigh, it is about nice people who have nice lives even when they are all finding it hard to find love. We particularly liked Eli Wallach - simply wonderful.If you imagine curling up with a glass of wine, a blazing fire, and a film; then the film you want to complete that picture is The Holiday. Pure Hollywood - and pure as the driven snow. England and Los Angeles never looked so perfect, and yet inside the package there are enough surprises and little touches that it never becomes too saccharine.The Christmas spirit suits well - and it is neatly and expertly directed by Nancy Myers. Yes, it wears its heart on its sleeve all the time, but it didn't make us cringe. Too perfect? Of course it is, and proud of it - if you are in the mood for a feel-good romance, with enough heartache to make it bitter-sweet followed by the clean resolution then this is your slice of movie magic. For out and out holiday cheer The Holiday is a winning and heady mix.",7,1,3,21 February 2007
Crazy Heart," My 315th Review: Over-hyped: nice small film
","Crazy Heart really doesn't stand a chance - so over-hyped it's almost possible not to get yourself for the performance of a lifetime.Though good, there is nothing so good about Bridge's performance that takes your breath, heart, or much anything else away.It is a good, competent performance - and I'm a fan. Thunderbolt and Lightning was the first R film I ever saw - but really here he's on point, but nothing as good as last year's performance by Rourke in The Wrestler.As I say, nice film, good songs, lightweight plot and just not enough to leave this heart crazy.More sleepy....",6,1,4,16 February 2010
12 Years a Slave," 556th Review: One of the Singularly Most Important Films of the Decade
","12 Years A Slave is more than a film - it is, as noted, superb, and I mean really superb as in a meaningful subdued grown-up mature cinematic experience - it has sequences that must make the hairs on the back of Terrence Malick's neck go up - the cast, the technical crew, and above all, director, Steve McQueen, will be lauded feted and deservedly all the good karma coming their way - but it is also one of the singularly most important films in film history.It has taken America 140 years to finally begin the process, which South Africa did in the Truth & Reconciliation Commission, of addressing openly the unbelievably deep wound of slavery - that still divides cities, that still determines worth and status, that still...This film tells of the absolutely true and unquestionably verifiable story of Solomon Northrup. There were 100s of such narratives collected and published in mid-century America by abolitionists though Northrup wrote it himself and his editor David Wilson was not an abolitionist. There are also accounts in Vermont and other newspapers of Northrup's lectures etc;. 12 yrs tells the story of a middle-class man, a family man, with a solid schooling, a good job: an ordinary American excepting, one detail. Without spoilers he, obviously given the title, loses all instantly and ends up a slave.Look, film needs more than Tarantino's sardonic satires: the greatest films did not 'entertain', they do not simply offer an emotional escape for two hours, they should, hopefully, change something inside those who see them.See it twice. If it seems too disconnecting first time then see it again. It deserves it. It is a film that drives for an honest take on the American Holocaust (60 million children, as Toni Morrison points out in her groundbreaking Beloved, never saw adulthood - if that's not a holocaust what is?). Let's just hope it creates space for America to stand still and stop still determining that some deserve, and some deserve to be in their place. We created slavery as an industrial process. It's just going to take forever to fix that pain unless the wounds are drained properly and that at least the high culture to take a stand. 12 Years is horrific without showing scene after scene of sadism, what is shows is more simply horrifying: men and women, families, like you and me, but without any choices in their lives - no choice allowed, not over their children, their work, their right to die. The real living dead. Above all, this is a film without platitudes, its about quiet placid suffering, and courage - it never shouts it credentials. It is more than just Roots for a new generation - it also opens up future history too.My instant reaction as I headed home in Sweden is that this film is the Schindler's List of the post-millennial - it's will not be seen by as many, even if it wins the Oscars it deserves, but here's hoping many more will go, if it does.How many really important films are made in a decade. This is a really important film.I'm laying my cards on the table: Oscar Winner of 2014 for best film, male lead for Chiwetel (though Matthew MacCouhany deserves it too), supporting male (Fassbender), supporting female (Lupita Nyong'o over Sally Hawkins - hers is coming for sure though), editing, sound, and finally Steve McQueen - sentimentally I want it to be Woody's year, but this is a truly important and groundbreaking film.",10,7,14,16 January 2014
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," John Hughes Meets Kevin Smith And Wow! - One of the better date movies ever---
","I've seen a ton of romantic comedies, some are good, some are awful; very few are really really good....You guessed it... wow! Did we love this: smart, dippy, cutting, funny in all shades of funny, sweet romantic with a down low low-fi edge, up to date and even occasionally over the top this was far and away our favorite romantic comedy of the year and I'm giving it a solid ten in its genre.Need to go on a date movie? This is your bucket of chicken - I promise you'll leave feeling lighter and curly wurly.Very well directed by Peter Sollett it really brings an affection to its making and he's a name to look out for if you ask us...All in all kind of our bag through and through... go see...",10,17,29,25 January 2009
Burlesque," My 362nd Review: Perfect for teenage girls....
","Burlesque is exactly what we expected: both Aguilera and Cher do well - one thing is for sure - Aguilera gives it some shtick, but the film is nothing new, and you come away feeling like Coyote Ugly just went Burlesque.Both Allan Cumming and Stanley Tucci are way underused and the substance of the film is non-existent. What we end up with is really pop videos and an American Idol feeling.But it works.It's actually fun to watch and there are way worse ways to spend time with friends. Watching it alone just doesn't suit this at all - it screams for an audience.All in all, it's made for teenage girls who are having a film party, but lacks that Chicago kick that would take it to a sophisticated audience.",5,1,2,4 February 2011
Whiplash," 558th Review - And all that jazz
","Whiplash is a tour de force of a film that hits you hard in stomach from the get go and keeps going. With career defining performances from J K Simmons as a Svengali mentor and Miles Teller as an ambitious young drummer willing to go through hell to achieve greatness.Director Damien Chazelle gives the film a near stage like look that suits it well, there are only three or four outdoor scenes, otherwise the claustrophobia created by focusing on the music practice room suits the piece well.This is a film about suffering for ambition. A film about the need to be the best, to strive for fame, but also about two characters who are destined to clash. Simmons is pure vitriol, knowing exactly how to use his temper and words to break a player, and it is a fine performance - showing just the right level of loss of control with a cold logic.Central to the film is the struggle jazz has to be seen. Given the immense work required to become a jazz great, jazz tends to be difficult on film compared to the glamor of rock. This is a film that likes it jazz straight up - and is better for it.It is one of the better films of the year. It is a powerful film with great performances that it is about very human traits: the need for approval and the abuse of power and if liberation is ever possible. Recommended.",8,0,1,22 January 2015
Stranger Than Fiction," Engages both the heart and the mind in a lo-fi way...
","Stranger than Fiction is a kind of a Garden State for grown-ups. Strange but not over-complicated, or overdone: sweet, sincere, surprising, and original. Unsual fare that is highly watchable and definitely worth the admission or rental.In particular, it's hard not to like the underplaying by all the actors: even in the moments where overacting would seem appropriate. Will Ferrell gives a performance that is much more in his Woody Allen style: small nuances, and an everyman confusion - even the compulsive disorder is played down: nice. As the movie develops the characters become more and more entwined but - and here is the clever part - every character is given enough time and space to make their delivery count - it really is a pleasure to watch, and like a great meal it is not the fare but the experience that really matters and lingers.A film about life, death, fate, literature, and yet it is handled with a sense that this is entertainment for the more grown-up without being intellectual stodge.The viewer is left with a very rounded experience - it really engages both the brain and the heart in a way that's all too rare - definitely one to savor and enjoy.",8,2,4,18 February 2007
The Wrestler," Powerful indeed
","The Wrestler works. It is first and foremost a straight-out tale of a man who has seen his glory days, and in powerful performances from the Rourke and Tomei we really do get two of the most satisfying performances of the year.Shot in a gritty realistic way, it plays on the Eighties with its dreams of economic forevers versus the cold reality of 2008, on fame, fortune, and even Lady Luck. Here, we have a man who did one thing really well, and just kept on going way past his sell-by date - yet he is heroic for it.What is impressive is that the characters have real lives and real depth - when Rourke is kind to kids or living it up or losing his cool in his other job it looks and feels immensely right. This is beyond method acting - it really is deeply if strangely honest. I totally bought the film, and Rourke can wrestle for real, and Tomei's dancer is just brilliant in her desperation and self-awareness - heartbreaking.The myth of Rourke himself is a strange one but you can't watch this and separate out the two. He has, despite what the myths would have us believe, never stopped working. He has made a film or two every year since the 80s but they generally were barely passable.He certainly takes the prize for the films he rejected. This from Wikipedia: 'He is alleged to have turned down a number of high-profile acting roles, including Eliot Ness in The Untouchables, Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop, Jack Crawford in The Silence of the Lambs, Tom Cruise's role in Rain Man, Nick Nolte's part in 48 Hrs., Christopher Lambert's part in Highlander and a part in Platoon. In a documentary on the special edition DVD of Tombstone, actor Michael Biehn, who plays the part of Johnny Ringo, mentions that his role was first offered to Rourke.' Here, he, Marisa Tomei, and Aaron Aronofsky are triumphant.It is kind of a hymn to blue collar values, and strangely enough it's also about how we stand by our values - even if it costs us a lot - whatever we have decided those values might be.Easily watchable - if full-on in the wrestling scenes - it lingered with us for days after and we found ourselves talking about it a lot.Mesmerizing and very good, definitely Awards-time good performances and production, this is 100% Rourke's best performance ever.This parable of modern America is powerful and carries a real punch - go see!",10,1,2,6 January 2009
Inception," My 331st Review: A Brilliant Thinking Summer Blockbuster
","Not one person moved in the largest cinema in the Nordic region last night. The premiere started at 10 pm and we we left at 12.30 completely immersed, satisfied, and astonished that a film could be so non-condescending to its audience and still be a summer blockbuster.This is real brain food coupled with summer blockbuster action that makes for an immensely satisfying experience - words spring up - labyrinthine, complex, high octane action - above all, Nolan gives us a real sense of cinema. Rather than some high end ideas and lots of CGI chucked together, we get instead a thorough exploration of some harder epistemological questions about what is reality coupled with stunning effects (that were made using mechanical sets mixed with CGI). On many levels this is one of the more satisfying films of the past decade.The plot of a man who can enter people's subconscious, who, after losing his wife, is not allowed Stateside to see his children, is then offered the chance to see them again, if he helps a Japanese industrialist. He must be insert an idea into deep subconscious of the heir of a rival industrialist. This is played out through layer upon layer of dreams. The plot is convoluted -but not contrived - and concentration pays off : effort = reward.We liked that fantasy is kept to a minimum - and that the dreams have more weight as they are based in reality.All in all, the film looks gorgeous (And we saw it on the largest screen in Scandinavia in Malmö, Sweden), it requires that you concentrate, does not condescend, is fresh, smart, exciting, dark, complex, and fun - and above all, we deserve films this smart. Can i say that again? We want films this smart - really.Not one person in the two and a half hours in the packed house of 600 went for a toilet break- and if that ain't recommendation enough I don't know what is....a great movie.",10,3,10,24 July 2010
Defiance," Great story but lacks real focus
","Defiance is a good effort - not as good as Katyn which tells a different story of a massacre and was released this year - to tell a tale worth the telling.It suffers from being too long and under-directed in places but it has a good cast and sense of purpose.It is best in the action scenes and maintains a sense of story elsewhere - it is a worthwhile watch, but I must agree with other critics here who comment that it looks too made for TV there is very little camera action excepting straight story -telling and the film is entirely linear and lacks a directorial cohesion and vision that would have lifted the excellent story to another plane.Overall, definitely worth viewing, but lacks greatness.",7,5,21,1 January 2009
Mary and Max," My 298th Review: Should garner awards: a brilliantly different film
","We live in an age of cookie cutter movies: action, romantic comedy, drama, thriller, you know what you're getting - it may be comforting both for the movie goer and the producers, but boy this decade stinks when it comes to original outstanding film - rather than a copy of a copy of a copy.Max and Mary is for those who admire the effort of originality. Telling with great humor, warmth, insight, and a certain darkness, and above all a unique style, it is the story of a small girl in suburban Australia, who is desperately lonely and an outsider, who, by random chance, befriends as a penpal a middle-aged Jewish Asperger: Max.This is not a charming film (though it has heart) it is a film about radical honestly, and a stark reminder that contact is what makes us human.The fact that it is also a true story just tops off a truly original piece of work. It should win awards for both style and content.",9,2,8,30 December 2009
X-Men: First Class," 435th Review: Outstanding Prequel - simply superb
","Forget everything you have seen in other prequels - this may well be the film of the series (Even without Wolverine). It is certainly a group effort and it is superb.Every scene and every actor delivers a deeply satisfying film that perfectly prequels and expands the X Men series.For this reviewer, this was easily the best film of the series so far - the script has real purpose and drive - and the action doesn't kick in too soon - we get tons of back story and character development, something of a rarity in action summer blockbusters.All in all, probably will not best Transformers or Pirates at the box office, but it certainly deserves to - hugely better than expected - and a good film all over.",10,6,10,9 July 2011
La Vie En Rose," The utter gut wrenching performance of a lifetime
","Marion Cotillard gives a performance of raw power and that will drag genuine emotions from the viewer in 'la môme', or 'la vie en rose'. Not tears of sympathy, or a sigh, but a real emotional response.I guarantee you will not see a better single performance that will tear and kick the tears out of you like this for quite a while. Despite my better judgment, (the direction is good - but lacks true vision for greatness), I found myself totally convinced by Marion Cotillard's performance. To describe it as simply accurate is to belittle her central force, she embodies the point of Piaf - the tiny, emaciated, nearly crippled waif who became the embodiment of Paris and one of the central cultural icons of France, more than Brassens, or Trenet, because she throws her heart , body, and voice into the part - and most of all into the pain.Piaf's life is the embodiment of a life that persevered no matter the cost. Everyone should see this, if only afterward to understand that they have nothing to complain of, ever, compared to the life of Piaf -- go see, and go beyond melodrama, or pathos to another place - Hugely recommended as one of the outstanding performances of its genre.",9,2,5,30 December 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," At last, at least, a return to nuances
","Vicki Christina Barcelona is a surprising tapas of a movie: it deals with emotions, sex, even sexuality - and does so with panache.Here Woody Allen makes the subtle subtexts shine again; there is a real honesty and openness to the writing - even when paradoxically the characters are hiding their true motivations - that lifts beyond many of Allen's films of the past decade.All in all the laughs are there but in a more knowing sort of way, there are little insights and great performances and everyone obviously enjoyed the process here.We particularly like the fact that this is a film about the heart and the mind; a film that encourages up to be neurotic if it helps us find love, and that anything is more important than settling - though settling is what we are all given.A film to enjoy, a film to make you think, and if Match was about London then VCB is about Barcelona: a more wild, a freer, a more Guadiesque, even Daliesque Allen, and one that we mostly enjoyed.",7,3,7,6 February 2009
Get Him to the Greek," My 340th Review: It's only rock'n'roll - hit & miss comedy that tries to sum up the madness of the music industry
","GHTTG is in no way the funniest film I've seen this year or the smartest - it's crude, rude, filled with sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll, but it does have a couple of good performances that grow on you as the film progresses - however, it is saved by the fact that it is one of a handful of films that actually tries to be about the music industry and it's complete madness.Solidly made there's lots to both and like and dislike here, it's pretty hit and miss, but if you've ever moshed in a pit, been covered in mud at a festival, been stoned and laughed like a drain then you'll understand this film 100%. If you're idea of rock'n'roll is that you're too old to like new music then you're not going to ever enjoy this.A tale of excess and excessive excess at that all wrapped in memorable oneliners it's just way too lightweight to score more than a 6 but it is offensive, crude, funny, self-deprecating, and by the end there is something of a journey - and that's what 's it all about. If you like Apatow comedies and a genuine satire on rock'n'roll then GHTTG will fascinate - just don't expect it to hit more than 50% of the time - it's a weird film with OTT performances that makes good mainstream comedy - go figure....",6,0,2,19 September 2010
Fast Five," 444th Review: High Octane Heist in Rio
","FF5 is a real thrill a minute ride - and given that it's over 2 hours long - it never flags or loses it's way for a moment. There's less racing and more action in this one and it could well be the best of the series - intelligent, fun, exciting, and even some heart, this really does have it all - and it a great guys' popcorn movie.The action takes place in Rio - and after corrupt cops and the FBI all start chasing our heroes they decide to go for one last big score both for the money and revenge.Honestly, this is entertaining action, and an absolute knock-out of a movie - don't let the fact that this is the 5th installment fool you - this is full-blown with a real budget and action stars - all in all a truly entertaining movie.",9,0,1,19 August 2011
Braveheart," If Oscars are given for effort...
","Then this is well deserved.Like all the best movies, it is amazingly ageless. Beautifully made, never feels like the 3 hours it is, with a BRILLIANT score by James Horner (For my money much better than Titanic) and wonderful sweeping shots of the Highlands, very well-done battle scenes, and one of the most romantic love stories ever on film it melts the heart and fires the blood...It may not be historically perfect, but it is near perfect film-making for an historical drama - better than Henry V or El Cid - it will remain a landmark film and rewards viewing over and over again.Very stirring stuff indeed.",10,5,13,21 March 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Gotta love Danny Boyle, Gotta love Mumbai!
","My first ever review on IMDb was a little known film from 2003, directed by Danny Boyle. Now some 230 reviews later I am back to where I started with Danny Boyle again...That film was Millions about a boy in Scotland I thought it was brilliant: an honest, moving, fantasy, all centered on hope in desperate situations.And that pretty much is Slumdog Millionaire: a film about hope and a film about romance, eternal love, with a neat plot device of using Celador's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire to frame each extraordinary chapter. Borrowing from sources as wide apart as 30s Westerns and the classical Arabic tales, as well as the questions themselves this opens up a vista of wonderful possibilities.The other star of Slumdog is Mumbai - and this is the breakout film for India - unlike Gandhi which was very Attenborough - this really looks like an Indian production team has worked at this - amazing colours, sounds, and settings - just a shame smellovision isn't ready yet! It is a tale of pessimism and optimism, it is fun, intriguing, and charming - and if course, exciting.It is deeply romantic, but as with all of Danny Boyle's films, it is not cloying or sentimental: honesty in film is the keystone here.It's above all entertainment, and entertainment with a conscience.A clear winner for the Awards and all we can say is please Mr Boyle can we have some more?",8,0,2,25 February 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," Gripping and definitely delivers on its promise
","A very worthy addition to the Bourne series - we actually thought it the best of the three - provided that you like the breakneck pace- we found it very thrilling from beginning to end - really gripping - and a decent amount of thinking to balance some very good chase and fight scenes.The art is in the details and here the details are well thought through, it looks and feels right and just makes the time fly by.Very exciting and very watchable - just concentrate for the first 15 minutes and you'll be up and running--- the plot is complicated enough to get you involved, and the action is (mainly) feasible given Bourne's training. All in all a very nice and satisfying resolution to one of the best spy trilogies.Highly watchable.",8,3,4,16 November 2007
Up in the Air," My 304th Review: Modern Parables - But Only A Partial Success
","Up In The Air is a nice movie - a good satire about work and a comedy about the price of modern business.It looks like its going to mop up at the awards and I'm just not convinced it really deserves to.Why? Well, it has a good performance from Clooney as the confident consultant and good directorship, but it lacks true honesty - it sacrifices real integrity for Hollywood feelings and I'm not sure i want to see the top awards going on a film-flam type of film.Others will say this is honest and strong and entertaining (A tough act to pull off) but even though it is a nice film, well made, strong performances etc; it just somehow is a little trite. Even Clooney, who really can make anything work, ends up a little bemused. I think its a shame that films like $5 a day, which we loved, will be chiefly ignored and this will be lauded to the skies.Fun to watch and it does have heart; but for out money it is too shallow to really deserve all the accolades coming its way.",7,53,107,10 January 2010
Atonement," Excellent production values to top a very good adaptation
","Atonement has awards written all over it.The story of two lovers betrayed by a younger sister then parted by the second world war is beautifully shot and conceived by a wonderful team. The settings are perfectly realised, and McAvoy et al do a good job. For my money, the ending is the best of any major film this year.Credit must go to Working Title and the legacy of George Harrison, Merchant Ivory, and even, Greenaway for laying the tracks that kept the British Film industry alive. It may not produce anything like the amount of the US or India but the quality is outstanding.The score by Dario Marianelli is certainly a highlight. Not the typewriter, but towards the end the score definitely captures strains of Elgar and Tippett. For my money better even that his score for Pride and Prejudice which was Oscar nominated last year. In addition, Seamus McGarvey and Paul Tothill both deserve mention for the cinematography and editing respectively.Will it win an Oscar? Perhaps not best film - but one thing is clear it will clean up at the BAFTAs for sure.Definitely worth the viewing- for my money better than the English Patient - more human and detailed emotionally - a must for all who like their films to be something to linger.",9,4,6,2 January 2008
