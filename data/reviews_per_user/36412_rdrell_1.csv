Requiem for a Dream," fabulous
","This movie is out of this world. That's the only way to describe it. It was incredible, yet I felt like I wanted to kill myself afterward. It really goes into the depths of some really twisted lives. The cinematography is absolutely unbeatable and really adds to an otherwise seemingly boring movie. I have nothing but good things to say about this flick except that you should really only see it if you need feelings of depression to compliment your already low-on-life attitude. Jared Leto actually did a wonderful job as the lead, and of course Ellen Burstyn stole the show. As a first time viewer of the movie with a friend of mine, my friend commented that she thought it was such a great movie, but could never watch it again. It's understandable. People that own this movie should really be questioned as border-line depressed or addicts. This movie can really be used in different contexts.",8,7,13,6 November 2006
