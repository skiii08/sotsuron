The Longest Yard," amazing must see film
","i saw this film last night at the cinema and i will definitely go see it again,it has got to be the funniest film i have seen in a while.Adam Sander is his usual self as an actor(funny loud very cocky and slightly cheesy) Nelly looks really nice looking in it and Terry Crews is just as funny as he was in white chicks playing cheeseburger eddy.Rob Schneider is in yet another one of Adam Sanders films with yet another weird and funny line which made me want to wee myself with laughter. Chris rock is also a funny character who plays caretaker Farrell.this film has the same kind of beginning middle and ending as mean machine so really it is the same story with a few differences.if you liked mean machine then you will definitely love this and if you didn't like it you will still probably like this film.its a must see film,and i will be buying it when it comes out on DVD.",10,0,2,11 September 2005
