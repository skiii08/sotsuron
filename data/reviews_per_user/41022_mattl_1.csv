The Blair Witch Project," A scary indie film that puts 'horror' back into horror films.
","At once scary, clever and disturbing this film is designed to give audiences the creeps. With video and some 16mm footage one woman and two guys head into the forest of Maryland to find the legendary 'Blair Witch.' They become lost and wander for many days pursued by something they (and we) never actually see but which they encounter in many frightening ways at night while they camp. Their scary story is recorded on jittery video and film footage that is apparently the only thing found of their remains. The two directors Myrick and Sanchez used a 'method' directing style to enhance the movie's effect. Sometimes the actors become annoying but in context of the directing method it works out well. The film teeters between documentary and fiction and will most likely keep people from camping in the woods for a while in the same way 'Jaws' kept people from swimming in the ocean.",Null,1,2,10 May 1999
