Spartacus," Freedom is worth dying for
","Spartacus is about a group of slaves rebelling for their freedom and ending up crushed, crucified and used as a political tool for a Roman senator to seize dictatorship. The main external plot, the slave rebellion, falls to a failure. The failure tries to convey the point of the story: that freedom is worth dying for, and the failure leaves us with a hint of hope for the future as a baby of a slave has been born free.The external plot is pulled to a failure because of another external plot's rise: that of a Senator abusing the slaves cause to capture dictatorship powers. This adds another dimension to the futility of the slaves' cause: that all their lives added together is worth no more than a politician's expediency.The external plot's hope at the end is given by an internal arc of another senator who turns moral and saves the newborn baby of the slave.The main plot of the story is powerful mainly because it unexpectedly fails when you expect it to succeed: the hero is spared by a 'Negro' fighter instead of winning as we expect, thus showing him the compassion that he would bring to his army of slaves in fighting for their freedom. The ultimate failure and crucifiction of all the slaves is also quite powerful in that you expect a journey like this to end positively (I didn't read the wikipedia article on Spartucus until afterwards).The supporting plots that involve the power struggle in the Senate are also surprisingly engaging.The story mainly falls flat on the arc (or lack thereof) of the main protagonist. Spartacus has no arc: he is a rebellious slave from beginning to end. Sure his rebellious nature gains greater purpose as he seeks to bring freedom to all the slaves, but that is established in Act 1 (the first hour). So for the next two Acts (the next two hours), the story's energy is sapped and stalled every second we spend watching Spartacus alone: building his army, getting a wife, building a bigger army, the slaves getting along harmoniusly, Spartacus and the slaves dancing in the sunset etc... These scenes are a complete waste of time since it doesn't come with any turning point on any plot. Maybe audiences in the 60s expect these filler moments to go to the bathroom during this 3 hour marathon, or maybe the female lead demanded Kubrick shoot her with fuzzy focus to make her look good and had a contractual limit on the amount of screen time she got, but it does no service to the story. With these scenes cut you can probably have a powerful film in a compact 90 minutes.Tangential thoughts below...My theory is since the story was produced by and starred Kirk Douglas, who brought Kubrick in after a disagreement with the previous director (see wikipedia), maybe the actor had too much say in the storytelling. So much so that the director and editor couldn't leave the boring bits on the cutting room floor. Or maybe the producers wouldn't let army marching scenes be cut since they paid so much money for so many extras to fill the screen. Reminds me of the big boring fight at the end of the first Pirates of the Caribbean that ruined a great movie: no way the producers would shorten those scenes after millions were already spent on the computer graphics. Maybe that's why the Pixar films are so great and tightly cut: its all computer graphics anyway and they all cost the same amount of money to render so cut away. So this leads me to think its a good thing for Director's to have final cut. But then again, a lot of these extended director's cut versions basically put a lot of boring filler back in. So I guess its only a good thing for 'good' Director's to have final cut, and they should only be allowed to make one cut, not a short one and (guaranteed worse) long one.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",5,2,5,19 July 2013
12 Angry Men," Everyone giving an honest effort to civic duty is a matter of life or death
","12 Angry Men is about the idea that everyone giving an honest effort to civic duty is a matter of life or death. It sets out to prove this idea with two external plots: one plot chronicles the journey of finding reasonable doubt for a Not Guilty verdict, the other chronicles the jury gradually giving an honest effort to the deliberation process. The result of these two plots, both of which end in success, gives rise to the idea that without everyone giving an honest effort, the democratic process would be broken.The movie is a short, confined story tightly told. It is an important story since the idea at the heart of democracy is a delicate one: that all members of society are innocent until proved guilty and that they each have the right to be judged by their peers. That 12 random people from all walks of life are the ultimate arbiters of what are life and death judgement is scary and liberating at the same time. It's scary in that each of us is a bundle of individual prejudices and hardened views that can sway our judgement. It's liberating in that these 12 random people need to unanimously decide on a single judgement despite their inherent differences.The movie highlights the democratic process by showing 12 specific individuals who are too busy and prejudiced from the get go to give the judging process an honest go. When only one juror stands between a death verdict and a long uncomfortable debate, the democratic process is on the verge of breaking down. By the individual standing up against his peers to insist on an honest discussion, he starts the process towards due diligence and evidence review that ultimately results in an unanimous Not Guilty judgement.The idea that it only takes one individual out of twelve to have the resolve for giving an honest effort to civic duty is a powerful one. It is the idea that the foundation of democratic society can rest on a single individual taking their responsibilities seriously. In fact it is the only foundation democracy can rest on.So the movie is about an important idea.But the drama of the story gets slightly repetitive in the second half, as juror after juror deals with their own prejudice. The story tries to give each juror a backstory that reinforces their preconceived notions and views, but having to do this for 12 people dilutes their power and makes most of them seem stereotyped and caricatured.But thankfully the filmmakers keep the story moving in a tight 90 minutes and don't ruin a good thing.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",5,2,6,24 July 2013
Elizabeth," Monarchy requires total devotion
","The plots were picked well to illustrate the Controlling Idea, that Monarchy requires total devotion, such that Queen Elizabeth would give up marriage and love to be devoted to England and be known by history as the Virgin Queen. But, the plots don't really grind against each other, the turning points are not natural progressions of each other and the story limps along without being driven by Elizabeth. For example, most of the Monarchy plot turning points are not effected by Elizabeth herself, instead they are by luck (Queen Mary dies, she is declared queen) and by others (Walsingham captures the priest and all the traitors). The Controlling Idea does not feel proved, it does not feel that she HAD to become the Virgin Queen to save her Monarchy and England. The sequel is much tighter in driving home its idea. Given this story, I'm surprised a sequel was given a chance to see the light of day.",1,0,0,19 July 2013
Full Metal Jacket," War is not worth wasting our youth
","Full Metal Jacket is about the idea that war is not worth wasting our youth. It tries to prove this with two stories: the first is the marines training for deployment, the second is the marines in action in Vietnam.The first story, the marines training for deployment, is told with two external plots: that of the not so bright marine Pyle trying to finish boot camp and the second is the entire class of marines trying to graduate. The class of marines succeed in graduating, but Pyle does not. He goes crazy after the harsh treatment meant to harden him to become a killer and commits suicide. So this story gets to the point that preparing for war is inhumane and not worth wasting our youth.The second story is about the marines fighting to win the war in Vietnam. This is told with two plots: that of winning the war and the second of the declining morality of the marines. The war is not won, it ends ambiguously as the marines win a small insignificant battle and return to camp while the morality of the marines shows a constant decline and ends with our hero committing murder.The movie is a great testament to the anti-war movement and a visual essay on the meaninglessness of war. But it is not a very engaging story. The first half of the movie makes a tight dramatic point that training marines to be killer has some inhumane consequences and proves it with Pyle's suicide. But the second half doesn't have an overall story arc to hang its hat on. The status of the main external plot of winning the war is left ambiguous. So the moral decline of our hero who has to commit murder at the end doesn't create as much meaning since the murder doesn't get us any further in winning the war.One can argue that that's the point of the movie, is that these atrocities are senseless and meaningless. And that is true. But in terms of a dramatic story, the meaning of the action is lost because the filmmakers abhorred making winning the war into any resemblance of a real plot.In the first half of the movie, Pyle's suicide is juxtaposed with the success of class of marines all graduating. Thus it makes the point that his suicide is not worth it for us to successfully train marines. But in the second half of the movie, Joker commits murder but this action is not juxtaposed with progression of any other plot. So the action loses the chance to create meaning through a consequence for his actions. It feels like the movie was cut off without any real resolution, like another 15 minutes were missing.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",1,9,25,24 July 2013
The Godfather: Part II," Protect the family even if it means breaking it apart
","The Godfather, Part II continues from The Godfather with the idea of protecting the family at all costs. In Part I, Michael's internal change from anti-Family to taking up his father's mantle drove the story. In Part II, Michael is unchanging in his pursuit to protect the Family. And we see this idea, that the family needs to be protected at all cost, taken to its extreme logical conclusion, with Michael killing his own brother.Part II also adds to the stakes of family by having a parallel story of Vito building the family in the last generation.In the end, Michael is able to protect the family, but at the cost of having torn it apart: having killed his own family members and casting his wife out.Part II is a great film that takes the premise to its gut-wrenching extreme but logical conclusion. It makes us question the idea that the ends justify the means that we bought wholesale in Part I.Redemption would be called for in The Godfather: Part III, but as we shall see, it will not come easily.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",5,2,11,19 July 2013
Apocalypse Now," War is horror
","Apocalypse Now does not make much sense to analyze with Story Charts because it's not really a movie. It's a piece of historical social commentary on the non-nonsensical nature of war by showing us a collage of scenes that outline the ridiculousness and craziness of war.You can see this on the Story Chart: there is no Internal Change for anyone (Willard starts out dazed and broken, and he ends up the same way). There is no Relationship change. There is just the external quest of the mission to kill Kurtz by going up river (seems like a metaphor for some sort of mindless journey). And an illustrative tapestry of crazy scenes you find along the way.The movie does not PROVE the central idea that 'War is horror', it just shows us the effects of war. That's why to me it's not a real movie, just a series of muddled situations that is somehow supposed to mirror the craziness of war. It shows us as opposed to making us feel the central idea by seeing a tight story propelled by the choices of the characters. Sure the scenery is memorable and the situations weird and unforgettable, but so is a National Geographic article.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",5,0,1,19 July 2013
American History X," Prejudice and bigotry will kill our children
","American History X is about the idea that prejudice and bigotry will kill our children. The idea is that prejudice is a slippery slope. A father's offhanded racist remark over the dinner can lead to unintended consequences. The result, in the world of this movie, is children killing each other. The movie makes a pretty convincing argument that the consequences in our world would be just as dire, that there is no room for even a little bit of bigotry in our society if we are to survive without killing each other.American History X goes about proving this idea with two main plots: the internal plot of Derek's redemption from being a skinhead Nazi to a tolerant individual actively helping the good cause and the external plot of Derek's attempt to save his younger brother Danny from the brainwashing that ruined him. Derek is successful in redeeming himself, but his attempt to save Danny fails when Danny is shot and killed. This suggests that even if we live with hate in a momentary weakness, that hate will have consequences far beyond the moment. The movie suggests that with hate, there is no such thing as true redemption. Therefore, we are all well-advised to avoid even a little bit of it.The movie makes the idea fully believable because of the depths of hate and true redemption Derek goes through. He seemed to have finally won the battle to save both his family's soul when his past all of a sudden catches up to him and kills Danny. This twist at the end makes it impossible to finish the movie feeling good about ourselves that the hero has won his redemption through his trials by fire. It makes it impossible not to think and feel and believe that hate will eventually catch up to all of us if we let it in for even a little bit. Great idea and a great movie.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",9,1,3,14 August 2013
District 9," Friendship triumphs over evil
","District 9 is a modern E.T. with guns and computer rendered aliens. The story is deceptively simple, a growing friendship between a human and the alien ends up with the human sacrificing much to save the alien and send E.T. home. The genre is more Action than E.T.'s Drama as the main escape plot encounters some pretty interesting obstacle and the gory nature of these E.T.s and the human's transformation into an E.T. provides enough tension and intrigue to keep the tight story very engaging.Pretty awesome.The filmmaking is very interesting too, with some documentary style scenes to move the plot along. Very different and engaging. The choice of locale (South Africa) and a weird accent with an unknown lead actor make the story easier to believe (like how some foreign films can get away with really cheesy lines and be very impactful because our social filters don't detect the foreign language cheese: like a lot of Anime (Naruto) or some South Korean romcoms (My Sassy Girl)). Pretty cool. A very tight movie.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",5,0,2,19 July 2013
Batman Begins," Justice triumphs over vengeance
","Batman Begins is about the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance. It is the second best of Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (behind The Dark Knight and ahead of The Dark Knight Rises). And you can see why with the story chart.Batman Begins goes about demonstrating the idea that justice triumphs over vengeance with three plots. The main external plot is of course, Save Gotham. This is augmented with a love story between Bruce and Rachel and an internal struggle of Bruce to seek revenge or justice.The problem is the internal plot ends in the first act. He chooses justice when he leaves the League of Shadows and his internal compass never again wavers. The love plot ends ambiguously at the end, even though he has chosen the path of the straight and narrow and defeated the revenge-seeking League of Shadows. So for the majority of the movie all we get to watch is Batman saving Gotham, and that can get boring pretty quickly. For a more interesting take on this idea, you will have to see the next in the trilogy, the epic Dark Knight.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",5,1,1,15 August 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Brotherhood is worth dying for
","Saving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war. The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported. The contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general: that the values of freedom, family and human rights are ideals worth dying for: even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors. The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect. The question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued, why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb? The answer: these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother, and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations. This seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the death.Great film told with what I count to be three major external plots: to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men. The lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two. Thus proving the Controlling Idea that brotherhood is worth dying for.My major complaint is the film is too long. Three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place. The brothers are 'good' from beginning to end and their relationships are 'good' from beginning to end. Of course there are minor plot lines like Opum's compassion for POWs and Reiben's questioning of Miller's judgement. But they don't create serious turning points in an otherwise external-action focused story. I think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle: the Carparso dying to save a French child, the radar assault that loses Wade and the church resting.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",9,2,3,19 July 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," Determination leads to the liberation of a nation
","Lawrence of Arabia is about a British officer's unlikely friendship with the Arabs during World War I resulting in his leading of Arabian tribes to establish an Arabian state independent from British rule. The main thrust of the story is the external advancement of the Arabian cause fed by Lawrence's single minded determination. The story is also propelled forward by the emerging friendship between Lawrence and the Arabs.The major obstacles to the external plot of independent are Lawrence's determination wavering from various causes: his internal conflict about bloodshed, his questioning of his proper place among his own race and the Arabian tribesmen's inability to focus on unified independence.It's a great story, particularly since this is a historical figure and many of the turning points are grounded in historical fact.But, at 3.5 hours, it is boring. There are not enough escalating turning points to sustain such a long period of time. Striving for historical accuracy results in force feeding us repetitive turning points with diminishing meaning (he crosses Nefud Desert with great determination, he goes back to save Gasim with determination, he crosses the Sinai with equal determination etc...) Interesting as the desert is, watching the expansive horizon for a cumulative 60 minutes is boring.Also, his internal struggles are muddled. Is it because of his confusing of his own place with his own people? Because of his fear of his liking for bloodshed? Because he is wacko? And why does he help the Arabs anyway?These are key questions since it's his single-minded determination that drives the main plot of independence forward. The answers to the questions are left fairly muddied through the 3.5 hours slog, so we are left admiring the expansive scenery for way too long.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",5,5,13,19 July 2013
City of God," Crime doesn't pay for anyone
","City of God is a movie about the idea that crime doesn't pay for anyone. It goes about demonstrating this idea by showing a succession of people trying to take over the ghetto with violence. Some of the candidates are kind-hearted Robin Hoods (Tender Trio), some are accidental gangsters (Knockout Ted), some are simply evil (Lil'Z) and some are a bunch of prepubescent kids (Runts). They all use violence to pursue crime. They all fail. Even as the Runts seem to rule the day at the end, having killed Lil'Z, you know things can change tomorrow (they're like, 10 years old). These four external plots are joined by an internal plot of our protagonist, Rocket, successfully avoiding a life of crime by luck and some fortitude.The movie seems to want to be more than an episodic chorus of violence. It strains to show that the ghetto and a broken system makes crime and criminality inevitable. It shows this mainly through the reluctant criminal of Knockout Ted who is basically forced to become a gangster after trying to live virtuously. But this idea is relegated to secondary importance for me: much of the violence is glorified, and our hero does escape a life of crime (even though he is no where near as virtuous as Ted was), providing contrary evidence to the idea that crime is inevitable.A change of protagonist from Rocket into Knockout Ted might have gotten this movie onto this bigger idea.That's not to say the movie doesn't have some pretty memorable scenes, locations and the fact that it's a Brazilian production based on true characters is pretty awesome. I just think it could have mixed its potent ingredients together towards a bigger idea.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",5,4,7,10 August 2013
Schindler's List," Absolute good triumphs over absolute evil
","Schindler's List is about the idea that good triumphs over evil. Small gestures of kindness can overcome the inconvenient irks of everyday life, but absolute good must rise to the occasion to meet absolute evil, no matter the cost. In this story, there is no question about the absolute evil: the innocent victims of the Holocaust (the appeasement of which implicates us all, see The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich). In the backdrop of this absolute evil, our hero is not without guilt. He is a Nazi party member, an unabashed adulterer and war profiteer. But when history gives him the chance, he chooses to pursue an absolute good, the saving of a thousand innocent Jews from certain death. And this absolute good, pursued to the cost of his entire fortune, redeems him of all the other ills he had accumulated over his life.To give this idea life, the story's main plot is that of Schindler saving the Jews. To show the cost of this success, another plot tracks his fortune which is given up to save the Jews. Two other internal plots depict the morality of Schindler and Goeth. To make us experience the idea, absolute evil is given a face, a personality and a humane charm. The choices Goeth and Schindler make highlight the inner battles that must be won to strive for the absolute good.This story is so powerful, it's meaning so relevant, that its experience is almost beyond words. This is why movies should be made. Its special resonance comes from the fact that given the ideas of such absolutes, the hero and villain are not depicted as black and white. The same story could easily have veered to a didactic history lesson, instead it is a shared experience that makes the world a better place by reminding us of what the human species is capable of doing to itself.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",9,17,27,15 August 2013
Amadeus," Jealousy can destroy a career, but not divine talent
","Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world.The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten.The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career.The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",1,9,23,23 July 2013
Gran Torino," A rock solid story about prejudice in modern America well told
","Gran Torino is about a prejudiced old man stuck in all his ways who makes unlikely friends with his Asian neighbours, two teenage kids. When the kids are threatened by an Asian gang, the old man protects them in the only way he knows how, with a rifle he used in the war. Violence leads to more violence and in the end he sacrifices his own life to give his friends a chance at a normal life.Gran Torino is a fantastic story well told. It employs all three types of plots: an external journey to save the kids, a relationship development of the friendship between the old man and the Asian kids, and an internal arc of the old man overcoming his prejudices. In the end, the old man does what would have been unthinkable for him at the beginning of the film: sacrifice his own life for his gooky neighbours.The themes of prejudice is echoed well in the supporting action in the film: Walt's ridicule of the good intentioned priest, the rejection of his own family and his war-bred nature to pull out a gun at the slightest possibility of provocation.My only beef of the film is that while it gives a strong platform for an ensemble of Asian actors, they are portrayed as fairly flat and undeveloped and some of their arcs are sacrificed for comedic relief. A check on IMDb reveals that the male Asian lead (Tao) has not had any other parts since this 2008 classic. That would be unthinkable for any other actor who played opposite the great Clint Eastwood. Alas, thank you Mr Eastwood for doing this much for the underrepresented nonetheless.",9,0,2,17 July 2013
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Civil liberties must be defended at all cost
","Good Night and Good Luck uses two plots to try to prove the idea that civil liberties must be defended at all cost. One plot is a reporter's external quest to defeat Mccarthyism: the violation of civil liberties in the name of national security. This plot succeeds: Mccarthyism is defeated. The second plot is the external quest representing the reporter's career and well being. This plot ends in a failure. So the movie tries to demonstrate the idea that civil liberties must be defended at all cost by showing that the successful defense of civil liberties cost our heroes their jobs, careers, and even their lives.This idea is a timely one for us: today the world is captivated by the tales of Edward Snowden: an ex-CIA worker who has given up his career and possibly his life to reveal massive violations of the civil liberties of all Americans by their government. As of now, we don't know how this story ends. We don't know if the cost of his sacrifice was enough to earn a 'success' of protecting our civil liberties. What we do know is that the US government, and much of the public, believe that it is necessary to give up certain civil liberties in the name of national security. What this movie tries to demonstrate is that the US Constitution is built upon the idea that basic freedoms cannot be compromised at all, and that they must be defended to the death. As our hero says:'We can deny our heritage and our history but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. We proclaim ourselves as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world. But we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the Junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his, he didn't create this situation of fear, he merely exploited it, and rather successfully. Cassius was right, the fault dear Brutus is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Good night, and good luck.'So the movie picked a very important idea to prove. Unfortunately, it doesn't do a very good job of proving it. The plot depicting the cost of our heroes is bland. There are no uplifting turning points on this plot. The heroes lose money, security, their jobs, the lives and their careers in a steady drumbeat of bad news. Because there are no twists and turns along the ride of this plot, the costs seem episodic and didactic. This makes the heroes seem flat and unreasonably 'good' as they continue their march against the villains irregardless of casualties and consequence. Basically there aren't enough twists here to keep the story interesting. None of the heroes undergo internal arcs (they are all conscientious from start to end) and none of them undergo relationship arcs (they are all in it together from beginning to end, even a married couple who were forced to split up).This make the film seem didactic: it is a series of self righteous speeches by our heroes against the villains and we are asked to watch the movie with the hindsight of history to see their actions in the proper moral light.Ironically, the Snowden story playing out today has more interesting twists and drama than Good Night and Good Luck:<ul><li>we don't yet know if Snowden will be successful in convincing the American people to defend their own freedoms. - Snowden has obviously acknowledged and accepted the costs to his career and possibly his life. - Snowden's internal ideals are tested enormously now: he has ironically sought political asylum from countries that have horrendous human rights track records as compared to the USA. This has already compromised his public reputation and may affect the outcome of his external quest as he could become an international political pawn.</li></ul>President Obama has even acknowledged in a condescending manner that the Snowden story might make a 'TV movie' someday as he tries to convince the American people that civil liberties must be 'balanced' with national security. Depending on how Snowden's internal struggles and his external quest turn out, his story just might prove the idea that civil liberties cannot be compromised at all and must be defended to the death.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",5,1,1,20 July 2013
The Dark Knight," Justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs
","The Dark Knight is the crown jewel of Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy. It is a story that is leaps and bounds ahead of average Batman Begins and not even from the planet as the garbage The Dark Knight Rises.The Dark Knight is about the same idea as Batman Begins. The idea that justice trumps vengeance. The Dark Knight takes this idea to extremes to suggest that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs. It demonstrates this idea with the main plot of Save Gotham's Soul. This is supported by an internal plot that takes place within Harvey Dent, his seeking of revenge or justice, which is irreversibly broken when the Joker kills his girlfriend Rachel. Joker's actions ruins Harvey and Rachel's chance at love and sets Dent on the path to destruction. Finally, Batman is not only the main driver of fights to save Gotham, he also sacrifices his reputation to Save Gotham's Soul. Thus, the idea that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs is demonstrated. Justice as an ideal must be protected even with Rachel's death, with Dent's false hero status, and with Batman giving up his reputation.It's a great story and a triumph of movie making in the age of fluff and crap. Too bad the final part of the trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises turns out to be as empty as this one is full.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",9,0,1,15 August 2013
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Love as Fate and Willing Acceptance
","ETERNAL SUNSHINE's narrative is essentially a love story told backwards. It deals with the traditional problem of reverse narrative in a new way. The traditional problem is that if the audience already knows the ending (bitter breakup), then telling the story in reverse asks the audience the question of 'is it worth it?' as we watch the story back to the beginning (falling in love). This intellectualizes the experience rather than giving us dramatic action. ETERNAL SUNSHINE deals with this problem of intellectualization by giving the protagonist an active role in the reverse narrative. Joel is able to interact with his old memories to try to stop the process of erasing; this attempt to escape is the major sub- plot of the film. The catharsis of the audience comes with his rediscovery of his love for Clementine as they try to escape together. They fail to escape at the climax of this sub-plot and his memory is erased. But the lovers meet again by fate and once again fall in love. This fake climax of the main love-story plot is placed at the beginning of the film and again at the end of the film – the audience realizes the despite losing all their memory, the lovers meet and fall in love again. If the film ended there, it would have been a good film, and the central idea would have been 'Love happens because of fate'. But the problem would have been that Joel went through this huge journey of discovery and change but that all seems to go to waste if fate was just going to put them together again – he needs to be the one making an active choice that demonstrates his internal change at climax. The real climax of ETERNAL SUNSHINE comes out of the reversal at the end, in which the Joel and Clementine discover their bitter past and must choose whether or not to commit despite their past. This resurfaces Joel's inner journey. He and she choose to commit, completing Joel's journey of internal change with an external action. The central idea now becomes 'Love happens because of fate but it will only result in a happy relationship with open acceptance of each other and the painful compromises that come with love'. This real climax fueled by true character change, dilemma and choice is what makes the film great. The climax completes the audience catharsis experienced through Joel's rediscovery of love; as a result he wins the girl and we are touched by a great story.My Story Chart of this movie is at storycharts.ca",10,5,7,19 July 2013
Titanic," Love conquers death
",Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond.The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.,5,2,5,14 August 2013
The Godfather: Part III," Crime will never let you escape
","The Godfather: Part III continues the theme of Family from the first two movies. In The Godfather, Michael had undergone an internal arc to go from outsider to Don of the family, dropping most of his morals along the way in order to protect the family. In The Godfather: Part II, this idea of the ends justify the means is taken to its logical extreme as Michael tears the family apart in order to protect it.In Part III, Michael tries to make the family legitimate in order to redeem himself. Unlike the first movie, where Michael's internal change happens on screen, and unlike the second movie, where Michael's does not change at all, this movie has Michael shifting gears to try to pay for his past sins. But this change does not take place on screen. Michael starts the movie regretting his distance from his children and spends the whole movie trying to make up, his internal compass does not change through the movie.So all we are left are two external plot lines: Michael's efforts to legitimize being constantly thwarted and his failure to protect his family because of his past sins keep catching up to him.The movie seems to be about something like 'Crime will never let you escape'. But the movie doesn't really prove this because so much of what Michael is paying for is offscreen and in the past two movies. The whole movie just feels like a confession for past sins and the filmmakers showing us that bad deeds will always catch up to us. The idea is not proved by action and choice of the characters on screen. This movie is a necessary but not a worthy tribute to the first two films, it probably shouldn't have been made at all.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",1,12,19,19 July 2013
To Kill a Mockingbird," To grow up is to overcome prejudice
","To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about the idea that to grow up is to overcome prejudice. It tries to prove this idea with three plots, one of each type:An external plot seeking justice for a wrongly convicted Tom Robinson A relationship plot between the children and Boo Radley An internal development plot of the children's maturation The external plot is the main driver of the story: a black man has been falsely accused of rape by a white woman. Worse, he is wrongly convicted by a jury of white men after having the audacity to declare that he was helping the woman out of pity. This plot results in a failure as Tom is convicted and killed while trying to escape. The plot has a reversal at the end in which the true criminal (and perpetrator of prejudice) is himself killed and his killing is accepted by the law as eye-for-an-eye for Tom.The external plot unfolds in the formative years of the children and has a distinct impact on their relationship with an ostracized neighbor. They begin by fearing, judging and harassing Boo Radley, only to find that Boo has been helping them from the shadows. The plot ends when the children welcome Boo as a friend.The internal plot of the maturation of the children makes steady progress. They demonstrate an innate acceptance of others (in sharp contrast with the societal mores) and end up overcoming their own fear of Boo by accepting him as a friend (when even society has not accepted him).To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story with a great idea: that growing up means overcoming prejudice. It seems to suggest that children have innate goodness and acceptance but can be molded by grownups and society to become blinded or become mature members of society. This contrasts with the idea that prejudice in any shape or form is childish and dangerous trait in adults and society as a whole. The story makes this point by tying together the three plots at the end: Boo kills the man who embodied prejudice to bring late justice for Tom Robinson, Boo does this to save the children, and the children accept him as a friend even though society still shuns him.It's a great movie.My only beef is the children's internal arc does not have many negative turning points. Their fighting (seemingly negative) is based on justifiable defending of their father's reputation, their jeering at Boo seems playful and child-like rather than childish and their talking Mr Cunningham out of the lynch mob and taking Boo's hand at the end feels a little caricatured and cringe-inducing. Maybe that's just my own feeling. Overall the point of the story is well taken and appreciated.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",9,0,1,5 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Determination leads to triumph over evil
","The Dark Knight Rises is the final part of Chris Nolan's Batman Trilogy. It is also certainly the worst of the three, behind the average Batman Begins and the fantastic The Dark Knight.The Dark Knight Rises is about the idea that determination leads to triumph over evil. It tries to demonstrate this idea with the main external plot of Save Gotham. This plot is supported by two others. The first is Batman's redemption and Reputation and the second is Catwoman's internal moral compass.The problem for me was that I can find no more than one significant turning point on each of these three plots. On the main plot. Bane goes from triumph to triumph as he enslaves Gotham with no disruption until the end. Similarly, on the Batman Reputation front, it is in the trash until he saves the city at the end. Finally, Catwoman is morally corrupt and betrays Batman ... until the end when she and the whole story turns around on one blazing action packed sequence. Somehow these few dramatic bits are supposed to fill a 2+ hour story. They don't. And the pictorial depiction of Bane's triumph is boring, boring, and boring. For solace, I guess we could always rewatch The Dark Knight.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",1,19,32,15 August 2013
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Inner strength is needed to defend one's country
","This movie has pretty much the same Controlling Idea as the previous Elizabeth movie: that devotion and inner strength is required to protect one's country. But this movie does a way better job of proving the idea. Even though as queen, Elizabeth is far removed from the physical battle and spy vs spy action, her actions (and inactions) drive every turning point forward. When she wavers, England suffers, when she is strong, England triumphs. This makes for a very satisfying ending where she rallies her troops to defeat the Spanish armada in one of England's greatest naval victories in history. Great movie.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",5,0,0,19 July 2013
Casino," Greed foils crime
","Casino is tough to analyze with Story Charts. The casino racket plot (along with all the other subplots) all start at their highs and tumble down to failures. The only Controlling Idea I can think of is that crime will always fail because of greed. The Story Chart for Casino is not very interesting, basically everything crumbles because of the characters are up to no good.My main beef with the movie is two fold.One is specific about this movie: why make a movie about crime that fails when no one in the movie does any good at all and there is no moral center to the film? Since everyone is up to no good, the only rational way to keep our attention is to up the ante on how bad the characters become and how cool they when they are being bad.So a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters 'cool' and full of 'attitude' and glorifying them. Seriously why do we need a movie like this? It seems to just perpetuate all the negative stereotypes about movies glorifying violence and bad characters.My second beef is in general about Martin Scorsese. I feel films like Casino and many of his other works are mostly show-and-tells rather than true storytelling by characters, conflict and consequence. This shows through most obviously through the abundant voice overs that tell us how 'cool' the characters are and tells us the changes that are happening as opposed to showing us through action and consequence. I think voice overs are the nemesis of absorbing movie making and Casino spends about half its time with its characters voicing over stuff that happens on screen: its like a holiday slide-show from 'cool' gangsters.I think Casino tries to objectively document a period of Vegas excess driven by a few characters and their criminal ways. It's voice overs certainly make it documentary-like. But its glorification of how cool these guys subjectively tells us to sympathize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.I don't get it, why make a movie that suggests crime doesn't pay but suggest it's cool to be a criminal? How does this make the world a better place? If it doesn't, why make movies at all?My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",5,2,4,19 July 2013
V for Vendetta," Bravery will bring down a dictatorship
","V for Vendetta is about the idea that bravery will bring down a dictatorship. It tries to demonstrate this with four plots. The main plot is about the revolution to overthrow the fascist government, which succeeds. This plot succeeds because of V's bravery in the face of oppression, and is supported by society's refusal to take it anymore. Society's rise to arms is demonstrated by two internal plots: that of Evey's growing bravery to the point of being willing to die to protect her freedom and that of the inspector general refusing to carry out orders for an oppressive government. Evey's arc is also accompanied by her growing love for V.The story ends with society taking up V's call to arms and marching on parliament to overthrow the government.The movie has numerous references to Nazi Germany and tries to make a point that revenge for its own sake is not the end goal, rather, overcoming fear to stand up for what's right is paramount. This is highlighted by the ending whereby V does not blow up the parliament on his own but leaves it to the people.It's a great idea.But the movie didn't work for me. Mostly because the beginning raised the stakes so much that the turning points leading to the end felt inconsequential or unbelievable. We go from the first 10 minutes where:Evey goes on a date past curfew, whereby she is: Harassed by the police with threat of rape, whereby: V saves her by beating the police up, V goes onto blow up the courts From there, the movie gets to work to lay out each of the plots. The problem for me is the first 10 minutes setup a world where hyperbole rules. This fantastical setup presents an extreme world that makes the rest of the movie's twists and turns hard to believe since the beginning setup two omniscient parties: the government and V.Great idea, just didn't work for me.My Story Chart for the movie is at storycharts.ca.",1,2,6,8 August 2013
The Godfather," Family above all other values
","The Godfather is about the idea of family above all other values. It goes about letting us experience this idea with three plots. The main plot is the external plot to Save the Corleone family. Supporting plots include the external plot of Michael becoming an insider of the family and an internal plot of Michael's morality.Michael starts out an idealistic young man who looks down on the dirty deeds of the family business. In the end, Michael save the Corleone family. But in order to do so, he has become the ultimate insider (the Don) and loses the values he had held so dear at the beginning.It's a classic story that can be argued to humanize a criminal family by making us a member of it through Michael's transformation. The stakes are laid out such that we have to believe the ends justify the means. This idea, to protect the family at any cost, is taken to its logical extreme in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II and then the pied piper comes calling for payback in the finale The Godfather: Part III. But Part I is what stands apart from its distinctive internal arc of Michael. In the other two movies, Michael's determination and moral center never wavers, we just see the external world's consequences of his moral choices.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",9,0,1,15 August 2013
