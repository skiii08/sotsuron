The Ring," You just can't please some people.
","This is more a comment on the comments in here than on the film itself. Of those who disliked the film, a number of them complain that the film doesn't explain enough, while others complain that it explains too much. Some praise the film as being very intelligent and original, while others complain that the plot is too thin. It's simply amazing to me how differently people perceive the same thing. The Ring is very much original in comparison with other horror films. It is not original in the sense that it is a remake of Ringu, but so what? It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, which, to me, is a big part of what makes it creepy. Are you still as scared once you've learned all of the answers? I know I'm not. It leaves a lot to think about, to wonder about, to imagine, and whether you choose to ponder the unanswered questions or not, The Ring is scary. It is, by far, one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen. Watch it on DVD, and then watch the Easter Egg - Go to the bottom right of the main menu, where it says, 'Don't look here,' (I think that's what it says - I don't have the menu in front of me) then arrow down, and hit enter. I'll rate this one 9/10.",9,0,1,30 October 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," See it!
","No long winded summary here. All I can say is that this flick was far, far better than anything I ever would have expected Jerry Bruckheimer to have produced. This is perfect entertainment for entertainment's sake - Indiana Jones at sea, or something like that. See it twice!",Null,0,0,9 July 2003
