Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Time befor the Dark Side rises
","The emotion viewing The Phantom Menace is different from SW IV-VI. The whole movie is held in light colors - no gray (nazi?) uniforms as the imperium will use them. No Darth Vader - no swamp - even Mos Eisley and the pod-race give a impression of the good old days of the republic. This tension is missing in SW I but Lucas is right at not showing it. I hope SW II and III will turn to the emotion of the rebellion, the presence of fear, weakness and disillusion. Knowing about Palpatins faith SW I gives only glances of the beginning conflict. Stunning is the design - invented in 1977 the Phantom Menace can follow this line of costumes and architecture - it is the same 'universe'. More special effects and aliens only enriches the universe - the SW-Fan feels at home. The actors in The Phantom Menace could not show their talents until now. Only Natalie Portman was able impress as Queen Amidala. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia seems like a teenaged schoolgirl (in SW IV) after Natalie Portman rescues her home planet Naboo. The other acting possibilities in SW I are taken by the Lucas Team of ILM - aliens in action...All in all I see 'The Phantom Menace' as an incredible good beginning. Please Lucas - let the STAR WAR begin !",10,0,0,23 August 1999
