Casablanca," Play it over and over again
","For the first time in my life, I felt this magnificent feeling for a film like nothing I have ever experienced before. I have seen many films in my 18 years and nothing, I mean absolutely nothing comes even close to this film. It is cinematic perfection - the music, acting, casting, everything is spot on. I sat through this film on the edge of my seat, from beginning to the mesmerising end. Casablanca shows true values for what it means to be in love and have friends that love you dearly, even though they may not show it upfront. Honestly, I do not even know what to write about it - I am left in awe. This is truly America's best film.Absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys great cinematic experiences.",10,2,3,19 June 2008
