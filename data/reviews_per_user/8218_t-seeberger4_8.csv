Casablanca," Analysis for Casablanca (1942)
","This film really made a lot of people happy. I also enjoyed a lot of the film. When it comes to the characters, I liked it when I noticed a few parts of the film where it's in a flashback with Rick and Ilsa. I also liked the parts when Rick said, 'Here's looking at you, kid.' Also, the photography shots are really nice. There were lots of shots that could be useful for photography, like the side lighting, diffused lighting, and more. Sadly, there were a few parts that I didn't like about this film, including the part when the police say that the caf√© was closed and the last part of the flashback. Overall, this film will be remembered as one of the best movies of all time!",10,1,2,25 March 2014
Citizen Kane," Analysis for Citizen Kane
","This movie is one of the best films of all-time. It's really amazing how we can interact with the other characters in here. There is a lot of stuff that people remember from this film. The one thing I remember best is Kane's last word, 'Rosebud...' It was the biggest moment from the movie that I remember. With the other characters, they really do a nice job of communicating with each other. At the end, I can't believe that the departing staff at Kane's estate burned down Rosebud, which was mentioned earlier. I love how the audience sees Rosebud as a sled in the end. This is considered a masterpiece in American cinema, and it will still be remembered for a long, long time. This is probably the best film that RKO Radio Pictures had ever made!",Null,0,2,5 March 2014
Taxi Driver," Analysis for Taxi Driver (1976)
","This one is a good movie in terms of a lot of things. The film depicts a character who is very lonely. I like the way that Robert De Niro did Travis Bickle, the character who is very lonely. It kind of resembles a little bit of my lifetime. I used to be lonely when it comes to friends who are very important. Anyways, another thing about this is that the music. I like the way the songs were put in the film and how they were from different artists. What Martin Scorsese did was unbelievable in a good way. He not only directed this film, but he also participated in the acting. We may not see him exactly in the film, but his silhouette is very good. The only bad thing about this is that there was a little too much crime in this film for me. I'm not used to crime, unless I see it in superhero movies. Overall, this is another film that people have to see again.",8,0,1,30 April 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," Analysis for The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
","This movie is a good one, but it's not as good as some of the other films that I have watched recently. When I saw the Route 66 sign, I knew that the family was going to another place. However, I didn't know that the Joad family's travels down the highway was hard. I was sad when Grandpa Joad passed away during the trip down the highway. Other than that, it's still good. The acting by Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell happens to be really good as the story moves on. Also, the writing of this movie is so good that it makes me want to see it at least once more. When it comes to how it did overall, I would say that it's not as good as some of the others, but hey, it's still a good movie. People shouldn't regret missing out on this movie.",8,0,1,12 March 2014
The Graduate," Analysis for The Graduate (1967)
","This is another good movie that changed how people saw movies. This has some of the things that the studio system didn't have back then. The worst part about this film was the point where people saw some quick shots of partial nudity. I didn't like it at all, even though it was one of the parts that had excellent editing. The reason why I didn't like that part is that I found it way too disgusting for my taste. This is perhaps the movie that started influencing other films to do that. However, not everything is bad. There are a lot more good parts about this film. I love the way Dustin Hoffman did his character, the humor, the music, and the editing of the film. The rest of the film like the minor characters and more are mostly a hit-and-miss for me. Overall, this one is another film that you should see.",7,0,0,30 April 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Analysis for Singin' in the Rain (1952)
","I love this movie! I find it the best musical feature since 'The Wizard of Oz', and I have been hoping that I would see it again. This was well written, very musical, and very funny. I also love the way the actors did their characters, especially when it comes down to the last scenes of the movie. When I see the film, I really believe that I would want to get into the beat and sing my heart out. I also like the way the actors did the dances, because they had to be choreographed nicely, and that was exactly what happened. The best part about the movie was when it was near the end. I love the way Don and Kathy did the last song of the film. Also, the last scene with the poster was very nice. I love the way the poster was done, and when I saw Don and Kathy kissing in the end, I loved it so much. Overall, this film is one of the best movies that I have ever seen!",10,0,2,7 April 2014
Pulp Fiction," Analysis for Pulp Fiction (1994)
","I actually like this film a little more than some other R-rated films, including 'Do the Right Thing'. There are more good scenes that I could watch than other R-rated films. However, like 'Do the Right Thing', this doesn't touch my heart. One bad thing about this film is that there was a bit of violence that I really don't want to see. In terms of the other parts of this film, they are okay, like the fight scene, but they also have some drawbacks. In my opinion, the worst thing about this film is once again some partial nudity. I have never liked seeing some movies that include nudity, starting with 'The Graduate'. But not everything is bad. There are some good parts in this film, including great acting, nice cinematography, and very good lighting effects. The rest of the stuff in the film are like a hit and miss for me. Overall, this is a good film, but it doesn't offer as much comparing to the other films that I reviewed.",7,0,2,7 May 2014
Psycho," Analysis for Psycho (1960)
","I like the way Alfred Hitchcock made this film. This was another classic horror film that people should remember. This has a lot of scenes that I remember, like the infamous shower scene. This is considered the most famous horror scene ever made. I even felt a little scared when I saw it. There are some more good parts about this film, like it had some good camera shots, it was scary and horrifying, and it had a lot of good acting in it. The shower scene sums up the film and the genre perfectly. The only flaw that I found in this one was the setup that it used. It was in black-and-white, but that's one thing about this film that makes it stand out like some of the others. Overall, this happens to be one of the greatest yet most frightening horror movie that I've ever seen.",8,0,1,9 April 2014
