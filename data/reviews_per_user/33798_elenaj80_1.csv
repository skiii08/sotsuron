The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A grower I found
","On first watch I wasn't too sure about this film, but now I've accepted that it's not supposed to be looked at as a film like many others are. It's full of beautiful shots that some fans will love, and possibly some will hate - you can't please everyone though.There are moments of the film where I just want to bury my head in my hands and shout 'whhhyyy' but like I said before - you can't please everyone and there are certainly parts of this I can't stand.Still, for those who say you could have put part 2 in with this are only going to be met with a barrage of fans who would have been happy to have seen a solid 3 hours just of the honeymoon scene let alone anything else in part 1.I thought that 2 of the 3 main leads of this film were at their best whilst sadly one (Taylor) wasn't really given much of a chance and whilst he should (in my eyes) have felt desperate and in love just came across as annoying and petty.The best scene was the birth scene and even for a 12a it was a little gory but i'd have loved a higher classification just to see something a litter harder hitting like described in the book. There was lots that did fit the book, lots that didn't but even the book was hardly the best and not to mention having to film/edit for the younger market. Don't forget, apparently this is a film for kids not really for adults. (Even if a huge proportion of fans are indeed actually over 30, or so I've read somewhere.) I've seen this film more than two times now, for research purposes only of course, but I can honestly say when I let myself get carried away with the cheesiness of a lot of it, I actually really really liked it!",7,2,8,23 November 2011
