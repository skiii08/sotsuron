The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Perks of being a wallflower
","The movie perks of being a wallflower is a movie about a 15 years old teenager named Charlie. He is an introverted person and has mental issues. He was molested during his childhood by his aunt. He blames himself for his aunt's death. As he struggles through his freshman year in high school, two seniors, Sam and Patrick help him. They introduce Charlie to the real world. Charlie falls in love with Sam in their first meeting. He tries to be restraint to his feelings but that leads to much bigger conflicts. He had a disorder called dissociative disorder.(The movie doesn't mention it). Finally, he manages to learn how to cope with his mental illness. I highly recommend this movie for passive teenagers.",8,0,1,28 March 2017
