Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What will the future.. or rather past bring?
","When the big hype started, I wasn't that excited to see the movie. But eventually, I was seduced and saw it on the 19th, not quite at midnight, since all the shows were sold out till 5 am.When the Star Wars banner popped up, I think I cried :) After the movie (which I really did not 'feel' as long as it was announced), I had to say Hmmm..The movie itself bursts with SFX, no doubt about that. One thing struck me, the flat and one dimensional shape of the chars. Personally I think, Mr. Lucas was 'seduced' by the power the computer offered him, and where he used story-telling and gripping characters in Episodes IV-VI, it all suffered a bit and was overpowered by SFX. Too bad, actually, since the story has it's moments, especially when Anakin is being discovered to be.. a messiah?? Wow! And of course the little remark by Senator Palpatine when he refers to Anakin's education.The superb Darth Maul was wasted, no doubt about that, as was Qui-Gon Jinn. It was too early for both of them to die. I would have expected Anakin (in Episode II) to kill Maul, who would have killed Qui-Gon (perhaps at the beginning of the movie). And Anakin would get his first taste of the Dark Side, by feeling the thirst for revenge and anger. Ohh, that would have been so sweet.Despite all the critique, and anything else others might say, it was a good movie. And it certainly makes us go 'Hmm.. so this kid will be the most feared Dark jedi Darth Vader? How intriguing!' Episodes II and III will hopefully concentrate a bit more onto storytelling and show us how a young boy can be turned into a machine. I suppose, this was Mr. Lucas strategy all along; to attract some of the younger viewers the see the movie, along with their parents (who saw Luke battle Darth, first hand), perhaps. So, Episode I is a bit of an animated appetizer, showing us in one way what to expect from the SFX department of ILM and letting us wondering how this 'messiah' is being turned into the 'antichrist'. For me, a little fact, that will keep me waiting for Episodes II and III. And deep inside I'll hope that there are gonna be Episodes VII-IX, that would be most awesome.",5,0,0,21 May 1999
Alexander," Bushy
","Well, it was historically more accurate than Troy, King Arthur and the like, the story itself was fairly okay, that is if you do not really know anything except the name. Even the part about Alexander and Hepheistos being lovers. (Even though this fact is a controversy among historians, and some accuse him of being not only bi, but rather a pedophile.) The movie itself was enjoyable, no doubt, and the acting was fairly decent. I liked the battle scenes, as they were more accurate than in other movies. The average life span of a foot soldier (even into the late middle ages) in battle was about 10 minutes. Now let's get to the fishy part: have you noticed all this wild talk about 'liberating' Persia? At it's peak, Alexander is in Babylon, mumbling about his father who could not bring that kind of freedom to the middle-east and so forth. Man, if I would not know it better, it would be as if the movie was about George W. Bush and his father, who failed in 91 with his little crusade in Iraq. If the movie is a mirror of today's political situation, it is really accurate. Look at it! You have a nation (Macedon) which conquers large parts of the known world, 'liberating' the people from the oppression of its former rulers. Then Alexander gave the rule back to the people who lived there (in modern words having them elect their own leaders) and pacifies the lands from the Mediteranian to Inda. That sounds fairly familiar, does it not?The more I think about it, the more I dislike the message in the movie.",6,1,3,27 January 2005
Meet the Fockers," One of the best sequels...
","... ever. I've seen the first one and it was good. At times too much slapstick comedy, but it was a good movie, especially due to DeNiro's superb acting and his quirky character.Usually I do not care too much for sequels, because they are aimed towards making some money and are mostly lame. Not in this case, even though it raked in a ridiculous amount of money. DeNiro is one of my favorite actors, so I thought it can't be that bad, if he accepted to star in it - he can't be that desperate, can he?. But the all-star cast of that movie, especially with a powerful Hoffman and an adorable Streisand is a perfect 'circle'. Stiller is just trying to be funny, but unfortunately he can't deliver in the vicinity of such awesome performances. Even Blythe Danner, who stars in !Huff - and she does a superb job - out-acts Stiller. Stiller tries, but he neither reaches the level of acting nor has he the experience, he is just a comedian, not a good actor.The story runs along the lines of the first movie, except the both families get to meet each other. That provides for some comic momentum, as well as the totally different characters of the family provide for some hilarious sit-com. The story if somewhat predictable, especially towards the end, but that does not really matter, because that is not the point. Hoffman and DeNiro just act it out, so to speak, and it is just a joy to watch them both in full swing. More than one time I was not only smiling, or giggling, I was laughing out loud and slapping my thighs because these two are awesome. There are few scenes where they transport so much humor, without being too 'humoristic', if you catch my drift. If you have seen it, you will know. Just pay attention to it. My favorite scene is the one where Hoffman tries to hinder DeNiro from leaving with his RV. Absolutely awesome!I did not give it the whole 10, because of a few small glitches in the storyline, mostly because of Stiller, who plays good, but simply can't keep up with the others. And last, but not least, because of the prospect of another sequel, which is certainly possible due to the commercial success the movie had. So, 'just' a niner from me.",8,0,1,7 February 2005
