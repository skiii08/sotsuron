3:10 to Yuma," Another superb western to add to my collection
","Not many westerns are being made any more, but it seems those that are being made are very good indeed. The last excellent western was Open Range, but this movie is much much better. The acting is excellent with Russell Crowe giving an outstanding performance as a very bad man with a streak of goodness still left in him. I thought Christian Bale was playing the hero but the true hero of this movie was his son played by Logan Lerman. A truly great movie must have a great bad guy, this movie had two of them, one played by Crowe and one played to perfection by Ben Foster(Charlie Prince), you just knew that if he got his way people were gonna die. Lots of action, great dialog, tension, a few twists, and in the end a satisfying conclusion.",9,1,2,11 October 2007
Skyfall," Same old same old bond movie. Snore!
","I was hoping for another Casino Royale but it was not to be. The song by Adele was the highlight of this Bond movie. A mindless plot, uninspired fight scenes, Judy Dench with lines that I'm sure she tried to forget. No tension, predictable twists, senseless violence and boring chase scenes that go on and on and on and on. The villain was a gay ponce who was about as menacing as Mr. Magoo, he did however tell an interesting rat story. Back in the old days you could go see a Bond movie at a drive in theatre. In-between necking bouts with your girlfriend you could keep up with the standard simple plot of Mad scientist tries to destroy or take over world. Back then you never noticed all the imperfections as you were usually distracted, now you sit and watch the whole thing and realize just how bad they are.",5,6,14,9 January 2013
Unbreakable," A thinking man's movie
",Those movie fans who did not grow up reading comics or who require at least 10 dead mutilated bodies per minute will find this movie slow moving and incomprehensible. As for me I reveled in it. I have read stacks of comics and understand the battle of Ying and Yang going on daily as it has been revealed to me through this wonderful medium. In the tradition of a good comic and with a subtle touch M Night Shyamalan brings us a story of the reluctant hero slowly emerging into a very scary reality. He has hid from that reality his whole life. Samual L. Jackson is superb in his role as the Arch Villain trying to find meaning for his life. Hollywood has finally picked up the Super Hero/Super Villain golden egg. Which one of us has not dreamed of having super powers. Unbreakable is part of this emerging gendra of film and a novel one at that. The explosion of Super Hero movies has just begun.,8,2,3,21 July 2006
Crash," An all time great movie! A well deserved Oscar!
","You can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. The acting is extraordinary, the topic and plot realistic and gut wrenching. This movie is not just about racism, but more about people making choices based on limited information and knowledge. They judge others before they've walked a mile in their shoes. The show is also one that envisions negative actions as having negative results, that is you reap what you sew or to put it another way, life is a circle and things come back around to bite or reward you. Further to this, one of the most profound lessons to learn from this movie is that we humans are a mixture of villain and hero. We have the ability to choose which we're going to be at any moment. Not many movies being made these days make any dent in our self indulged semi-conscious lives, but this show does. It makes you think and demands your full attention. Don't watch it with someone who never shuts up or has the mental capacity of an Amoeba. This is a movie to share and to discuss long after it's over.",10,0,4,3 January 2012
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Funny, poignant, intelligent spoof!!!
","I saw this film with my son and we both laughed and laughed. It is very funny but also has it's serious side. The acting was superb! I have seen Walk the line and several other movies of that genre and this spoof nails them perfectly. The thing that makes this movie far superior to other recent spoof movies is that it does have serious parts in it and also an excellent music track which is performed by the leading man. Other spoof movies are just stupid, this movie is intelligent. Some movies you watch once and that's enough for a lifetime, this movie is for collecting and watching again and again. Go see it in the theater, you do get more than your money's worth of laugh's. I had not even heard of this film and didn't know what it was about when I went to see it, but was not disappointed at all!!!",8,1,3,3 January 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fantastic Mysterious Tension filled Movie!
","I don't give very many 10's but this movie deserves it. I watched both versions the Swedish and the Hollywood remake back to back. Both are excellent! Alfred Hitchcock couldn't have made a better movie. Great acting, a plot that made total sense and kept me wondering where things were going, and tension that had me sitting up at the edge of my seat. Don't watch this movie if you have an aversion to brutal violence. Some scenes are very very graphic. Hollywood is into remakes these days while great stories like this are being made into movies in foreign countries. There are thousand's and thousand's of other untold great stories out there but Hollywood is only interested in reproductions catering to young audiences that have never seen the original. Add new up and coming stars and Jazz the old movie up a bit and yes they probably make money, but in the end they have soiled a work of art. No one has chosen to re-write 'War and Peace' or a Tail of Two Cites' no one is repainting the 'Mona Lisa' so why is Hollywood so eager to redo old movies that are works of art.",10,2,7,19 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Another Needless Remake!
","Hollywood is sorta like a big factory building widgets(movies) and they have a certain quota to produce. These remakes are an attempt to fill their quota without much effort. No need to be creative! Just take a movie, any movie, add some new actors to it and voila! What a pile of horse manure. This movie should never have been made. The fight scenes are boring, the part where the construction workers all turn their cranes in certain direction to help a half dead spider man get back to fighting the lizard and save the girl was just so sappy it made me want to hurl. I read all the old Peter Parker(Spider Man) comics when I grew up and the Toby Macquire portrayal is more in line with the comic books. This movie made no sense whatsoever. Here is this mad doctor trying to find a way to make people stronger, and he's been looking for it for 40 years and all Peter has to do is wander into one of the doctors lab's filled with spiders and get bit and he's turned into Spider Man. In 40 years the mad scientist didn't get bit once....mmmm. Also the Lizard turned a whole bunch of police officers into lizards, why didn't they attack Spiderman as well. And what is the point in the Spiderman mask if he is telling every second person who he is. Hollywood and the whole movie industry doesn't value it's own work. Movies that should never be remade because they are works of art are redone for the sake of widget production quota's. There are countless great untold stories waiting to be turned into movies, but Hollywood chooses the easy way out. I gave this movie a 5 only because is did have it's moments.",5,2,5,19 July 2012
Tropic Thunder," Controversial but exceptional comedy!
","Ben Stiller has done it again with this comedy, he has once again moved to the top of the comedy heap. This movie will become a cult classic it is that good. I have read several of the reviews for this movie some good some bad. It's usually that way for exceptional and groundbreaking movies, some people love them some hate them. This comedy makes fun of a lot of things such as washed up actors that appear in really bad movies, and actors that have to prove that they are great actors by playing a mentally challenged person, and war movies that try to be 'so realistic'. In the end people should wise up and realize that at the core this is a spoof on Hollywood, it is not trying to make fun of blacks or mentally challenged people, it's poking fun at Hollywoods portrayal of them. Example: In the 50's white guys used to play Native Indian roles in Western's. That has since stopped and Natives are used in Native roles as it should be. So why do Hollywood actors and critics and the public still think that it's OK to have the mentally challenged portrayed by normal average people trying to prove that they are great actors. Some have even won Oscars for their performances, this movie pokes fun at that!! Jack Black, Downy, Cruise, and Stiller give great performances and the laughs never stop coming.",9,1,5,26 August 2008
No Country for Old Men," Violent overrated movie!!
","Once again Hollywood picks a movie as best picture that should be great but falls far short of the mark. Last years departed is another example. This movie is so full of holes it makes Bonnie and Clyde's car look like it just drove of the assembly line. The acting was so so but not great as is required to win an academy award. This movie reminded me of those slasher films where the killer shows up everywhere and kills everyone and leaves bodies everywhere and the cops are absolutely ineffective and useless. The one scene where the killer is fixing his own gun shot wound reminded me of other movies such as Terminator and Rambo, it's all been done before and better. To sum up, if you like violent action shows it's pretty good, if your looking for a movie that is Best Picture material this is not it.",6,13,26,29 February 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Not a western! Not a western! Not a western!
","I watched this movie finally on DVD and while it had some good not great moments it lacked something. Let me see now, there was no plot, no real tension, the dialog was absolutely boring, no action to speak of, the characters were one dimensional, and the so called Hero(Jesse James) was despicable. Not one character in this movie inspired any remorse in me at the thought of them dieing. The one train robbery that took place was so boring and stupid that it defied logic. Brad Pitts acting abilities were wasted on this show, he did a much much better job in Portraying Achilles in Troy. That movie had some great dialog. In the end this movie can be summed up as a portrayal of one backshooter shooting another backshooter. John Wayne will be rolling over in his grave to think that this movie is called a western. Great movies must have some memorable scenes, memorable dialog, characters that rouse our emotions and we care about, a plot that has us on the edge of our seats, and a purpose for making it. This movie has none of the above and thusly can be said to be mediocre at best.",4,2,5,5 September 2008
Drive," Confused Over rated Movie!
","The one redeeming feature of this movie is the action which is done very well. However this movie is definitely conflicted on what it set out to be. Was it about an up and coming race car driver, a stunt driver, or a driver for bank robbers and other assorted criminals. Was there supposed to be some romance? Was this a Organized Crime Drama or maybe a psychological thriller, but in the end it was disorganized pieces of all of these things and thus really about nothing. Very unsatisfying ending. Lousy acting on the part of the leading man. The strong silent type has been done by much better leading men, such as Clint Eastwood, Ryan O'Neil, Audi Murphy, etc. This attempt by Ryan Gosling does not work. He should be cracking jokes and smiling a lot more, that's what suits him, he is not menacing enough with his pretty boy looks. The movie 'The Driver' with Ryan O'Neil has been copied to quite an extent by this movie. Shame on Hollywood. This movie is just another unimaginative remake of one or two other movies. Wait and rent it, or just watch The Driver and instead of being disappointed you will be thrilled.",Null,1,3,28 October 2011
Across the Universe," Unplugged Beatles - Most Excellent!!!
","Excellent movie that should be seen on the big screen and with the sound turned up!!! This movie made me realize just how good some of the Beatle tunes are that I had not previously thought highly of. Remember when Eric Clapton came out with his unplugged version of Layla which in it's original form wasn't a favorite of mine, well the unplugged version is. This movie is what I would compare as the unplugged versions of a lot of the Beatle music. This movie may be a love story but that is not the focus or even the reason for making this movie, it's all about the music and based on that it succeeds or fails. I think it definitely succeeds. The Janice Joplin and Jimmy Hendrix look and sound alike versions of some Beatle tunes are the highlight, but the best new rendition of a song is sung by Joe Anderson and is Happiness is a warm gun. Wow!!!",9,0,2,15 February 2008
Meet Joe Black," Amazing and Unique!!!
","This film is a pleasure to watch, I have done so more than once. The acting is superb and the plot thought provoking. What really stands out is the dialog which is several notches above the usual drivel that comes out of Hollywood. Very quickly you come to like and care about the characters in this film and by the end of this film it is very hard not to get weepy eyed. I have never really noticed that this movie is long and I don't think it is possible to cut any parts out without losing something important. Very few films have profound things to say besides being entertaining, this is one of them. The low rating on this site is reflective of the problem with society today, we have to many people who require special effects, several dead mutilated bodies, car chases, graphic sex, and foul language throughout before they can enjoy a movie. They then rate this movie based on the lack of the things I just listed.",8,2,3,28 May 2008
The Dark Knight," To save the day give me Dirty Hairy!
","Everyone knows you always save the lady not the guy! Except whoever wrote this script I guess. This movie is way overrated by movie goers. I don't know how to explain what is happening out there in movie land but movies that at best are good are getting these rave reviews. Dirty hairy would have shot the joker in about the first 5 minutes and saved us 2 or more hours of absurd violence. Let me see if I can sum this movie up, the bad guy is killing dozens of people, while the good guys including the so called Dark Knight are wondering around doing nothing until all hell breaks lose. The basic story line of this movie has been done before and better in the Crow. At the least the Crow knew what to do with bad guys, you kill them. This Batman was the wimpiest yet and got his ass kicked several times. I think Adam West from the 60's batman farce and whoever was Robin could have done a better and quicker job of mopping up this Joker. Heath Ledger got a little to preachy for my taste, just shut up and be bad. Oh and for those who read deeper meaings into this movie, like the Joker representing world wide terrorism and Batman using unethical methods to combat him(monitoring cell phones) give me a break. This is a comic book hero, no wonder I bought Marvel comics as opposed to DC 10 to one.",6,4,11,5 November 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," Not even a good porn flick
","Stanley Kubrick must not have gotten out much. If this movie was meant to somehow shock us then obviously some of us have never rented a porn flick or gone to a strip joint or had someone do a lap dance for us. The only people who would find this movie shocking or perhaps at least interesting are living in some old folks home, having been born in the 1800's. What I don't understand is how Tom Cruise would get mixed up with this loser. Maybe he was anticipating his coming divorce and wanted to stock up on money for the settlement. After such an outstanding career it's a shame that this Dud will be remembered as Kubrick's last movie. People should get better at their craft not reach rock bottom with their last effort.",1,2,12,21 July 2006
The Happening," Not for Neanderthals, but for Homo Sapiens!!!
","Once again the average Neanderthal that writes these reviews has slammed a good movie. Not enough blood and gore and the monster didn't show up. They want a monster that shows up immediately and starts killing, or else it's no good. This movie had plenty of tension, mystery and good acting. The plot was logical and made total sense, and really made you think about man kind and his existence on this planet and just how tenuous it is. The premise of this movie is that mankind has not been a good caretaker of the planet and has gotten a warning from nature. That's pretty straightforward and should be easy for even the Neanderthals to comprehend. Too bad their so easily confused. Listen up those of you who have split off from the Homo Sapien branch, in future don't bother going to see anything by this director as he is far too deep for you, stay home and watch reruns of Mr. Bean. A lot of the critics of this film make an argument that this could never happen, and they point out all sorts of scientific reasons why not. The point that is being made by this movie is that when mankind's doom comes and it may never come, it will be from something that we least expected and weren't prepared for. Look at the black death that has killed millions over the centuries and the influenza outbreak at the start of the twentieth century, both of these mankind could do little about at the time. Also there is a lot of criticism of the acting, which if you reflect was pretty much how all of us would react in this situation. This wasn't a Bruce Willis movie where everything he does is spot on and he saves the day because he is so all knowing and brave and Johnny on the spot. No this was a movie about ordinary people coping with extraordinary times, and not doing a very good job of it. The encyclopedia says that the Neanderthal is extinct, by the reviews this movie is getting I think not.",8,0,4,7 August 2008
The Departed," 'Best Picture'! Not!!!!!!!!!!
","This movie has been nominated for an Academy award for best picture of the year. A movie should be absolutely great in order to garner this honor, and this movie is far from great. It's entertaining but the acting is flawed(do you see anyone nominated for best actor, supporting actor,best actress, best supporting actress)no! Oh wait Mark Walberg was nominated for best supporting actor, need I say more! As far as the plot go's imagine Bonnie and Clydes car, now imagine even more holes than that. L.Decaprio and M.Damon put in dismal and unbelievable performances. L.Decaprio wore the same grimace the whole movie and M.Damon couldn't even get one emotion to register on his face. My concern is that the need to recognize Scorsese may crystallize around this good but not great effort. I'm sure Mr. Scorsese has at least one more great movie left in him, lets give him time to bring it forward and not diminish the truly great movies that have gone before by including the Departed as a Best Picture winner or even Best Direction.",6,0,1,25 January 2007
There Will Be Blood," A real thinking persons movie, very profound!!!
","There are not many movies being made these days that can do what this one does. It not only entertains, but has you thinking about it for days to come. There are so many nuances and eddies of plot in this movie. The characters are believable, multi-layered and absolutely mesmerizing. Daniel Day Lewis won a deserved Oscar for his performance, they should have given him two as his performance was that good. Once again black gold(this movie) is overlooked at the Oscars and fools gold wins the best picture award(No Country). Who ever is doing the choosing these days for the academy is either blind, deaf or both, or maybe just stupid. The departed last year and now No Country, both of which are good at best but not great! The Academy of Movie Picture's best picture award should go to a movie that is great! There will be Blood is a great movie!",9,6,10,7 March 2008
August Rush," Music makes the world a better place
","This is an amazing movie with great acting by everyone! The music is superb as is the plot. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex's around when you start watching this film. I had a good friend who never listened to music and had no favourite songs. That was as foreign to me as someone saying they didn't need to breath oxygen. I can remember as early as 5 years old hearing the song 'The battle of New Orleans' and thinking 'that sounds good'. This movie is all about music and how important it is to humanity. We are a musical species! If Aliens are travelling light years to get here it's probably for the music, as music is the universal language that requires no translation.",9,0,0,17 September 2012
Tombstone," One of the top 10 westerns of all time!!!
","Great acting, great action, great dialogue, great scenery, great plot, and finally a great movie that grabs you and never lets go. This is what a western is supposed to be. Gritty, tough, bloody, believable!! It easily compares with other great westerns like the Unforgiven, The Outlaw Josie Wales, Dances with Wolves, A man called Horse and other top ten westerns. The various memorable scenes in this movie become more than the sum of their parts, they very nearly reach perfection. I have watched this movie a dozen times and will continue to watch it over and over as the years go by. You can do that with a truly superb movie while others gather dust.",9,2,4,5 March 2008
300," Not bad but not great!
","At times this show seemed quite cartoonish and unreal. Most of the characters were one dimensional. Unlike Gladiator where the audience had a good understanding of the bad guy and came to hate him by the movies end, I felt no real animosity against Xerxes. The plot as it unfolded and the so called reason for the 300 fighting the Persian Hordes made no sense whatsoever. I read somewhere in a history book that it was a delaying tactic to hold the Persian hordes up while the Greek army could form up and prepare. That makes more sense than the reason given in this movie. The fight scenes have all been done before and much better(Troy, Braveheart, Gladiator, and the latest Bond movie). Unlike Braveheart and Gladiator I was not left feeling sad at the hero's demise, as the movie did not have that magic that makes the audience care about the characters.",6,0,1,1 June 2007
Gangs of New York," Violent nonsensical historical crap
","If your going to make a movie about a time in history you should first be able to tell a story, and it should be interesting. This movie made no sense whatsoever, it was just a bunch of scenes which were shot for bloody effect. The characters held no appeal whatsoever. A movie with the magic of making audiences care about the characters being portrayed is truly great. I didn't care whether any of the characters lived or died. I kept waiting for something to happen that would help this movie redeem itself but it never did. It just went from bad to worse and back to just bad again. If you want to watch a truly incredible movie about the gangs of New York, watch The Warriors. By the end of that movie you are 'one' with them. You want to be a warrior. The name Scorcese associated with this movie has caused it to be way overrated. Mr. Scorcese you should be getting better at your craft but your not, your movies just keep getting worse. Overrated lousy piece of crap.",3,1,6,12 October 2010
The Nice Guys," Great Buddy Movie
","Surprisingly I really enjoyed this movie. It had an excellent plot and it was genuinely funny! Crow and Gosling have chemistry and I look forward to a sequel. The action was good and the movie was unpredictable which for movies like this is amazing. Go see it, you won't feel you got hosed and want your money back. The laughs are plentiful and very well done. Both Crow and Gosling are funny people. Some actors are just not funny such as Seth Rogan whom I find just plain stupid and vulgar. Comedy at it's best is about timing, like in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. This movie has a bit of that magic to it.",9,3,7,6 July 2016
High Fidelity," Great love story with an entertaining musical backdrop
","Some people have trouble understanding what this movie is really about, it is not about the music, it is about relationships. It is truly one of the great love stories of our time. There are some very important lessons that people could learn from it to improve their own relationships. The music is integral but not what this movie is about. The most important lesson to learn about having a good relationship is commitment! Watch it without interruptions and with someone you care about, and buy the CD as the music is great. As romantic comedies go this movie sets the bar very high indeed. It's not for people who never shut up even during a good movie. The dialog is intense and should be listened to with out someone talking in your ear.",10,0,1,24 September 2007
