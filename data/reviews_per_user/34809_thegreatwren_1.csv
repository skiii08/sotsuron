The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Blown away.
","A good sound track in a film in my opinion can make a good movie great and this film takes it a step further making a great movie near perfect. the film does a poor job of making it completely clear what year it takes place in and I had to google it to check after a famous David Bowie song came on and none of the characters had heard it before or knew who it was. I can't say if its the direction or the acting or a combination of both, but i felt as the characters did in every major plot point. Few films have made me feel this many emotions in a hour and forty-five minutes. I have never felt compelled to write a review about a film before and perhaps its simply to do with the fact that i went into this film with low exceptions and came out singing its praises but I was truly blown away. My only compliant is that i was taken out of the film every once and a while because I kept having to pause the film to google the cast as i kept recognising a lot of the cast but couldn't say from where. this includes the main actor being Percy Jackson in the film of the same name 'Patrick' being the flash in justice league and of course Emma Watson and Paul Rudd among others.In conclusion this is a must see. 
P.S. I ranted a little forgive me.",10,1,2,22 July 2018
