Conquest 1453," Conquest 1453
","The biggest budget job in Turkish cinema sector, I think that $17.000.000 was spent in this movie.When you see this budget, naturally you expect great things, you want to spend your time for a visual show. Unfortunately, I couldn't find that I expected. In fact, for 160 minutes, we would deserve better movie. The movie starts in 600's years, Mecca. Our prophet Hz.Muhammed says that ''Constantinople will definitely be conquered one day, what a nice commandment is the commandment that conquers it, what nice soldiers is the soldiers that conquers it.'' Couldn't be better starting for this movie but later Then we go Ottoman Empire and bear witness to that II.Mehmed gets throne. And we understand after a few minutes that the movie for kids. In fact, almost the movie for kids because it contains a lot of violence. I don't want to be unfair for done work. But I wish better things. In this movie, everybody talks Turkish even if Byzantium people. OK, I can understand this but. Why are all the Ottomans talking Turkish as if they live in our era. I don't expect to Ottomans language but I don't want to it of course. I want to talking about costumes. I didn't like costumes obviously. I don't think that Ottomans wore these. Even if they did, every costume can't be new and clear.(I'm talking about soldier) When we come to effects, I think that extreme bad. When I saw the scene of sinking ship, I closed my eyes. A lot of PC games effects better than this movie's. I can accept the fake beard on players in short movies but I can't say the same thing for $17.000.000 movie. I think that there was a lot of unnecessary love scene about Ulubatlı Hasan. The other thing about Ulubatlı Hasan, I saw the Aragornfrom Gondor instead of Ulubatlı Hasan. The movie showed basic information maybe some wrong information us. But a lot of people liked this movie and will continue like. I think that these people can't tell apart myths from real. Can the movie get money? Of course, it can, it will do very much. I hope that we will see better movies in future from our directors. But I call the directors, please don't touch our history, if you don't know our history and you can't make good movie.",6,53,111,18 February 2012
