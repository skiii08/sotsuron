It," Wait. This was good?? (L)IT!
","So, I went and seen IT with my girlfriend and was absolutely blown away. My girlfriend and I are big fans of the original IT 'Miniseries' and it made us happy to see that they had done this new movie well.The gore was over the top for sure but it seemed to work and kept me tempted. Every time you thought, the jump scare was not going to happen, it did and I hate when a horror movie builds up a scare and then it never happens. All that for nothing.IT was genuinely scary and held true to the story for the most part, which was awesome. It had an absolutely amazing cast, which included an amazing casting choice for IT and the kid from 'Stranger Things' was in it.The scares were great. The Comedy was great. The story was held to. Fun as all hell to watch.I recommend, Gavin Johns, Wanna-be-critic, sk8teboard11@gmail.com",8,4,8,20 September 2017
Baby Driver," Fun Summer Movie
","Coming from a sort-of dry summer in the likes of movies, this was a diamond in the rough. I went to this movie right after seeing the new Spider-Man and actually enjoyed Baby Driver so much more.I am a huge fan of music and the only people who will not like this movie are the people who do not like music all too much. The whole movie is basically a music video and they show that in multiple ways by having Baby stop his crew so he could start the song at the right time or subtly having lyrics appear on the scene as he is walking.The greatest part about this movie was that the chase scenes were not choppy and hard to watch, which is typical in a car movie. They are actually really smooth and easy to follow. Characters are lovable and there is almost nothing wrong with this movie. ALMOST. There is one or two things that bothered me and this wouldn't be a good review if I didn't address them. #1- The Love aspect: The movie has a waitress that Baby falls for. That OK, but she falls for him way too fast and barely blinks an eye when he kills someone. Most people would not fall for somebody so hard, and that quick, that they would watch someone kill a guy and then run away with them. #2- Jamie Foxx's character sucked. He played it well but overall, the character was really overplayed and a clich√© to say the best. Still a great movie. Watch ASAP.Gavin Johns, wanna-be critic, sk8teboard11@gmail.com",9,2,7,19 September 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A tarantino film for non tarantino fans
","If you're not a HUGE fan of tarantino like all the people who are writing these reviews, I can nearly guarantee that this is more than just watchable. This movie has fed into the hopes of tarantino fans (such as myself), but kept the storyline in such a way that you dont have to be fiending for excessive violence like the rest of us. The acting is GREAT, The comedy is hilarious and it puts a very happy spin on an otherwise, really dark topic. MUAH, TARANTINO, MUAH. Im impressed.",9,5,18,12 August 2019
A Clockwork Orange," Ehhh. Am I the Only One?
","So, I have seen a Clockwork Orange three times now and it still hasn't come off the least bit good. The acting is not terrible, the story-line is not awful, it just isn't good.This movie seems to have way too many rape scenes and the idea of 'ultra-violence' was not as cool as you may think. The movie, though it was about Gang violence, in a way, still bored me to sleep. And I know people are going to say that is why I didn't like it... 'You fell asleep' 'You didn't give it a chance' You're just butt hurt over the violence'None of those apply because I have seen all the way through THREE TIMES. I gave it a chance and managed to stay awake, though that was a challenge to say the least.Also, I am a teenager. Violence doesn't really make me upset in any way. What does make me upset is a mediocre, at best, movie in the top 250. Really People, the only reason you voted high is because it was 'different'. Well, there has been a lot of 'different' movies and that does not make them good.Sorry, Gavin Johns, wanna-be-critic, sk8teboard11@gmail.com",5,2,4,20 September 2017
Inception," Leo at His Finest...
","How did you get here? Do you remember? If you don't, than you may be in a dream. Inception was movie where a thief journeys into the minds of important people and steals important information. The thief and his comrade hire a new recruit, considering the last one sold them out, as they try to complete the hardest task they have. Inception. When you watch the film, you will understand. Maybe. This is a film you may have to watch twice, in all honesty. I have seen it thousands of times and still feel weary on my understanding. If you love Jo-Go-Lev(Joseph Gordon Levitt) or Leo, than there is a 99 percent chance, you will love Inception.

The Silence of the Lambs," Great Thriller that Kept Me Tempted.
","The silence of the lambs was a movie I had been told to watch for a long time. Considering the fact that there are very few movies where I can see a rape scene and still like the movie, I had not watched it yet. I watched this movie and I had taken it all wrong. There was a few scenes that were hard to watch, such as the abduction of a young girl, but the movie was still worth watching. The movie was vulgar but who does not love a vulgar movie? I do. It was fun to watch the main character and Hannibal 'bond' as he sort of got in her head and it was great to see how much the detective would take to be better at her job. Great movie, Gavin Johns",8,1,2,6 September 2017
