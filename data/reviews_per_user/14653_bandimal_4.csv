50 First Dates," Sensitive, funny and moving
","For an Adam Sandler movie, this is uncharacteristically sensitive about a true medical condition. I'm actually glad I saw it. When I rented it, I was expecting a lot of stupid jokes, people taking advantage of Lucy, and finger-pointing. Instead, it's a comedy that includes a caring community and family who watch out for one in need.The video that Henry makes is a real 'intervention' that would be done by nurses or medical personnel helping brain-injured people. His sensitivity and caring, working with Lucy's family, and changing his lifestyle immediately instead of coming to a sudden conclusion after hurting her, give light to a well-researched script. Lucy is not portrayed as ditzy or stupid. Nobody makes light of her injury. Amazing.I have to give this movie an 8 because it treats Lucy so well. I hope Sandler can build on this type of comedy in the future.",8,0,0,3 September 2006
United 93," Powerful and realistic, agonizing tribute
","This movie is not only a tribute to the passengers aboard United Airlines Flight 93, but also to the people who are charged with Air Traffic Control and defense of the United States. It shows in brutal detail how unprepared our 'defense systems' and 'liasons' were to maintain communication and confirm accuracy of information in a time of crisis.I was touched as much, if not more, by the people who came back and portrayed themselves in the Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) as by the actors who portrayed the passengers aboard the doomed plane. Here is true patriotism: the willingness to remember the mistakes of the past and to admit them in public so that change for the better is possible. These people showed us the chaos that they endured as they tried to follow their training and protocol and yet failed to get cooperation or permissions from their superior officers or counterparts at other agencies.I am glad that Mr. Greengrass decided to make the movie in real time for the events that occurred aboard United 93. It shows how quick and decisive action was taken even in the midst of chaos and crisis. No matter how much artistic license was taken, the end result was the same. The hijackers did not make their mark. We had a small victory that day.10/10",10,1,3,30 April 2006
The Mummy Returns," The real hero(ine) is Evie
","Most reviews and news sources have failed to mention an important detail about this movie -- the real action is led by Rachel Weisz's portrayal of Evie/Nefertiri.  While the men have their moments, the main event is the action between Evie (the reincarnation of Egyptian Princess Nefertiri) and Anck-Su-Namun, complete with sword-fighting, martial arts, and a timeless rivalry.  The women carry the movie, and the men get the credit...",7,0,0,6 May 2001
A Beautiful Mind," *POSSIBLE SPOILER* Good portrayal of mental illness
","This movie is a touching portrayal of the difficulties of mental illness.  I think that Ron Howard did a wonderful job of leading us as viewers into our own delusional world of schizophrenia, and then shocking us with reality in the same way as Nash himself was faced with the truth.  'A Beautiful Mind' is in the same league as 'As Good As It Gets' -- on my A-list of movies which portray mental illness in an accurate and compassionate manner.",10,0,1,7 January 2002
