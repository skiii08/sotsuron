Skyfall," Horrible Non Bond movie missing all essentials of a Bond movie.
","I had to review this movie! I just don't understand why is it getting good votes if every single person I speak to is hating it. Bond movie has a very specific formula Attractive and British agent Womaniser Heartbreaker FUNNY with subtle sense of humor. Awesome cars latest gadgets And great plot It has to start with the best graphics and music Has to have at least a super sexy Bond girl and a super sexy Bad Girl. Skyfall should be rather called Skyfaill. No girls, no gadgets, no cars... Boring. You gave us a radio tracker(fist size ) and a fingerprint gun?... Seriously?? I love bond movies, wasn't impressed by Casino Royale, thought Quantum of Boredom... Oops of Solace was bad but this really beats them all. Bond movie just died, can it get any worse?. Casino Royale compared to this was a masterpiece... Don't waste time or money to watch it at movies... Btw they even managed to have a Black Moneypenny. Why don't we make Naomi Campell play Liza Taylor, rite?..",1,14,28,15 November 2012
