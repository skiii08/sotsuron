Casablanca," DVDs have spawned a whole new industry
",". . . brand new documentaries and interviews featuring the key people involved in the making of the film.For this classic movie, it happened just in the nick of time. Some of these old birds are **really** old. After all, the film was made in 1942. The fabulous coup of this one was to have it narrated by Lauren Bacall. (Anyone remember her?)The interviews and commentaries make the price of this particular DVD well worthwhile.",Null,0,0,8 February 2000
Dead Poets Society," (Some) teachers teach that knowledge waits. . .
","but not John Keating. You can have it right now!My comments here centre on Robin Williams rather than on this film.We don't see a lot of movies here but I've now had a bit of exposure to Williams: Good Will Hunting, Good Morning, Vietnam and, now, Dead Poets Society.Williams comes across as something of a minor tragedian in each of them. Is this because he brings his personal tragedy to each role or that he has stumbled into scripts in which tragedy is a part? I'm not sure, but I suspect it may be the former. I must say I find it rather engaging.",Null,0,0,16 October 1999
Chicken Run," The DVD release of this film adds a significant dimension your total chicken experience, featuring:
",-a full length commentary by the co-directors-documentaries on the making of the film-interviews with key players and film makers-shorts takes from previous films-short animations from the early careers of the film makers-a game (if your computer has a DVD drive),Null,1,2,13 January 2001
Battleship Potemkin," The DVD release of this film will bring a far wider audience . . .
","which is a good thing. Professional film critics detail the significance of Battleship Potemkin far better than I can.Speaking for myself, Eisenstein seems to compose the film as if it were a photo-mosaic. He lays the images down to construct an entire canvas. I was reminded of the intricacy and deftness of the brush strokes in the best work of Cezanne: different medium, same emotional effect.",Null,1,1,12 December 1999
Independence Day," Giant toadstools
",".  .  . crouching o'er us all.If we don't do what ol' Toadstool say then he gonna turn the heat lamp on us. Mebbe we better fight back, and (coincidentally) save the world for democracy. De mockery.(And IMDB insists I write at least four lines of text for a review to be accepted for display. What happens if the film reviewed is worth less than four lines? Way less.)",Null,0,0,24 June 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Psssst. This is not the film . . .
",.  .  . whose scenery will convince you to visit New Zealand. See instead Jane Campion's The Piano (see my IMDb review.)You'll pack your bags right away.I will say this about Peter Jackson--he's managed to make his movies here but the ocean doesn't feature at all--gives you an insight into the astonishing variety of the physical geography of New Zealand.,Null,0,0,22 February 2003
The Piano," Yep, the scenery's *exactly* as portrayed, so. . .
","pack up your bags and check us out--the birds, the beaches, the beeches, the mud--it's all real. A number of the beach and forest scenes were shot less than 25 miles from Auckland (population: 1 million.)I wouldn't dare make a critical judgment on the story line--it's preposterous, it's plausible.Michael Nyman's score for the film is available on CD. Nyman says the musical themes (which nicely unify the score) derive from Scottish folk music.",Null,0,2,17 November 1999
The Graduate," This movie is a period-piece.
",It captures the essences of ennui and insecurity pervading the late 1960s. It captures the 'drift'.My own view is that too little tribute is paid to the importance of the music in the making of mood. Paul Simon very clearly understood what Mike Nichols wanted to portray.,Null,3,5,16 October 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," The DVD version of the movie . . .
","is definitely worth buying because it features recent interviews with all the key figures including Gregory Peck. You also get to see Scout and Jem, all grown up.I expect this film continues to be used in schools as a platform for discussion of contemporary social issues.It would be a shame, however, if the movie were to be used as an simple substitute for the book, which explores a greater number of issues besides that of race. In addition the book nicely employs a couple of literary devices, which, in the hands of a skillful teacher, would be accessible to unexceptional high school students. And of course the story is riveting.",Null,1,1,19 April 2000
The Wizard of Oz," 'Just as good the fifteenth time as it is the first'
","Irony high and irony low.Low irony: the soporific songs and singing, combined with a schmaltzy storyline, guaranteed failure for every theater release and re-release. 'Just as good the fifteenth time as it is the first.' Of course, the film has had outstanding success on television. Television success: Bravo!High irony: the didactic Message that 'there's no place like home' takes more time to deliver on the bonus material of the DVD edition than the movie itself. Of course this Message, like all 'Messages to wayward children', is beyond any child's care or understanding. This is not a film for children but, rather, a film for the 'child inside every one of us.' One might as well subject that inside-child to numerous viewings ('Just as good the fifteenth time as it is the first') in a vain attempt to convey the Message. No actual child would willingly submit to such torture.",Null,0,0,23 June 2001
