Black Swan," A new masterpiece!!!
","Black Swan is a breathtaking psychological thriller. Its cast and their performances were absolutely perfect. Natalie Portman did a great job and her acting was one of the best of her career and she deserves an Academy Award nomination or ever she could be a winner of an Oscar. Mila Kunis gives also a very good performance. Both of then deserved their Golden Golbes nominations and i believe that Natalie Portman will be the winner of the Golden Golbe for an actress in a leading role. Vincent Cassel , Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder were also very good in their supporting roles. The direction of this movie was also excellent , Darren Aronofsky gave us a great result. But this movie is so good because of its marvelous story by Andres Heinz. There's nothing else to say , all the things in that movie were the best , the story , the direction , the screenplay , the soundtrack , the cast and especially the outstanding performance of Natalie Portman came together to give us a new masterpiece!!!",10,2,5,26 December 2010
