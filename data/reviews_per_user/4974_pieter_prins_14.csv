Bad Teacher," Good cast, bad movie
","With a cast with Cameron Diaz, juatin Timberlake and that Marshal guy from how I met your mother, I expected a good movie. But what was it supposed to be? A commedy can't imagine cause all over I had one little smile about the dry humping scene. What's left is a boring teenager feel good movie.",3,0,0,14 May 2020
Tropic Thunder," Over the hill
","Sometimes over exerated stupidity can be funny. One moment the movie is not funny, the other I had some laughs...especially about the surprised reactions of.the Vietnamese guys.",6,1,2,14 May 2020
The Butterfly Effect," Interesting to think about
",One of those Movies that makes you think about live. How can one act define the path of life of even various people and what are the consequences of you change that act. Interesting thoughts. Well acting.,8,1,1,12 November 2019

Black Snake Moan," Blues baby

Logan," A realistic , not over exciting , end
","After all the x-men and Wolverine movies this is a Movie which isnt to much about action, but about characters . Its a nice Movie , not the end with a big bang. However pretty realistisch how Wolverines and Charles end up in a not heroistic environment .",7,0,0,12 October 2019
Midsommar," Weird Swedish stuff
","You can more or less compare it with the Wicker Man, but then slower , almost 2,5 hour. Nevertheless I didn't really mind. Although it's a slow movie it managed to have an atmosspere that you just wanna know what the hell is wrong with this community. It's not really horror its weird stuff.",6,0,3,5 March 2020
Drag Me to Hell," Better as expected
","I didnt expect much of the tittle. But iT wasnt bad at all. Maybe quite Some horror clichÃ©s . But at least something different as the haunted house . The zombies or the pocessed child. The gipsy woman is pretty scary . And iT has a dark and sinister atmosphere , feeling she cant escape of the course and time is running out. And Some actually scary and surprising and scary scenes . Ive seen loads of horrors but this one is in my top 10",8,0,0,9 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Cult just because it is, not trying too hard
","One of the few bearable cultural movies. It's cult on a dark cynical way, without trying too hard and with just 100 square meters as the playing ground. Don't expect wild action and probably you have to be in the right mood to watch this movie.",8,0,2,11 May 2020
The Cabin in the Woods," Weird but intriging
","Its a bizar movy and sometimes its close to becoming boring . Nevertheless it does want you to see the end. Its a surprising different horror Movie . IT combines real predictible stuff (friends in the woods, woods etc. With still Some surprising elementen as in the end it becomes not only this cliché and you catch yourself in thinking 'what the hell is happening here'. So i was doubting beteren 6 and 7 but gave 6 cause for a horror it wasnt really scary for me.",6,0,2,5 October 2019
