The Avengers," The movie that made the Marvel Universe truly come to life on the big screen
","I never thought I could become even more of a fan of Joss Whedon, but he managed to do just that. He (and the fantastic cast) successfully gave life to all my Marvel heroes filled childhood dreams. Well played.",10,0,1,29 December 2018
Blade Runner 2049," Very worthy successor of the original. Not perfect but still very good
",Very worthy successor of the original. Not perfect but still very good. I think I may add another star after second watching... it is a long movie to sit through and digest.,8,2,15,1 January 2019
First Man," Great retelling of a well-known story
","It does feel like they added a healthy dose of 'emotional Hollywood coat of paint' on pretty much everything related to the characters' personal lives, but there is no denying they went to great lengths to get all the technical details right and capture the right atmosphere for each moment of the events. Some people seem to find the pace a bit slow (and boring) and it I am usually very susceptible to that but surprisingly I found it to work in the movie's favor in this case. I also couldn't care less about the whole flag scene controversy.",8,0,0,27 June 2020
Men in Black 3," A bit silly at times but hey, it's Men in Black
","More entertaining than the second one. Still a bit silly at times but hey, it's Men in Black.",7,0,1,30 December 2018
Alien 3," Reviewing the 'Assembly Cut' special edition
","When I saw it originally it was obviously not as good as the first 2 movies and quite frankly, not that good in general. But I just watched the 30 minute longer Director's Cut (Assembly Cut) and it clearly improves it.
It is still not at the level of Alien and Aliens but it is now a good movie on its own. Also as much as Alien was Ridley Scott's platform to set up the whole space horror genre and establish his style of dark sci-fi, and Aliens was James Cameron's rulebook to big action sci-fi blockbusters, Alien 3 Assembly's Cut is clearly the beginning of David Fincher's career in dark, psychological thrillers.
Unlike most die hard Alien franchise fans, I actually like the fact all 3 movies are very different and were the canvas for each respective Director to hone what would become their trademark directing style.",7,0,0,16 June 2019
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," They took everything from the 1st one and went too far. Still entertaining.
","While this is not a bad sequel, it's not as good as the first one. They basically made the same movie and cranked up everything to 11 (action, style, unrealistic situations, anachronisms, etc.). It is still an entertaining movie but it's a bit too over the top, especially for a Sherlock Holmes movie. Also, it tends to drag on a bit at times.",7,2,3,30 December 2018
Requiem for a Dream," A fantastic movie I never want to watch again
","Great writing, directing and acting performances from all but especially Jennifer Connelly. I have however never felt that awfully uncomfortable after watching a movie and no matter how fantastic it is, I never want to watch it again. I do very highly recommend watching it at least once though.",9,2,2,29 December 2018
Sucker Punch," Visually stunning but no substance; I really wanted to like it more
",It is visually stunning especially for people like me who like comics and video games. The lack of an interesting plot (and substance in general) made it all the more disappointing.,6,0,4,30 December 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," It really has nothing to do with the first Cloverfield
","I read reviews saying this had nothing to do with the first Cloverfield movie but I still wanted to watch the first one first, in case there was some link to it. Nope, this can be viewed as a standalone movie entirely so I have no idea why they had to use 'Cloverfield' in the name.. And it is a superior movie; I would make it an 8/10 if it weren't for the ending, which if not bad per se is definitely not on par with the rest of the movie. More psychological thriller than sci-fi with fantastic acting; I guess when you have only 3 actors in your movie, even with a small budget you can afford good ones.",7,0,0,19 May 2020
The Equalizer," Very entertaining action thriller
","I did not expect to like it that much. If you're into John Wick and Taken, this is definitely for you. Maybe not the most original and a few too many cheesy slo-mo shots but still a well executed action thriller Movie.",7,0,0,28 December 2018
The Expendables 2," Better than the first one but still a huge missed opportunity
","Just like the first one, with the cheesy 80s action flick concept and this cast they could have done great but they just did ok. They did however manage to do better than the first one.",6,1,1,30 December 2018
Source Code," Great sci-fi thriller
",I am very happy I went in knowing nothing about it because on top of being a great thriller and a solid sci-fi movie it made it a very pleasant surprise.,8,0,0,30 December 2018
Skyfall," Not the best James Bond actor, but the best Bond movie to date
","Daniel Craig is not my favorite James Bond, but I must admit he was a great fit in this dark take on 007. And for once I agree with most critics, this is probably the best James Bond ever.",9,1,4,30 December 2018
50 First Dates," Not the best rom-com around but cute and very watchable
","It's clear it's not the smartest, best-written or best-acted rom-com and even if Adam Sandler tones his Sandler-ness down a lot, he's still very much Adam Sandler here. But it's a cute story and as a fan of rom-coms, I liked it!",7,1,1,29 December 2018
Iron Man 3," A very good and entertaining installment in the Iron Man franchise, much better than the previous one
",Not as amazing and fun as the Avengers (that movie really set the bar high for super hero flicks) but still a very good and entertaining installment in the Iron Man franchise.,9,0,0,30 December 2018
It," Well-done remake but still your average horror flick, no the terrifying movie it's supposed to be
","Remake well done; still, your average horror flick, nothing groundbreaking or truly terrifying here.",7,1,1,1 January 2019
Minority Report," Original sci-fi movie with plenty of good action
","Ok we know the book is always better. But I haven't read it and so I thoroughly enjoyed this great sci-fi movie. Great story, directing and action sequences, what's not to love?",9,0,0,31 December 2018
John Wick," Good but not the groundbreaking action movie I was told
",Everything says I should have liked it a lot more. But while it was a decent action flick I don't really see what the fuss is all about. Action scenes were well done indeed but not the groundbreaking work I was told. The actual plot is paper thin; I wish they had spent more time developing that whole hitmen underworld thing!,6,1,3,31 December 2018
Gravity," Wow, instant classic
","I hadn't seen Sandra Bullock in a movie for a while and I'm glad this is what she's been up to! This movie has phenomenal visuals, great acting and -- sorry critics but not sorry -- good writing and plot in my opinion.",10,3,3,31 December 2018
Akira," An absolute classic in the world of animation
","Even if you only have a passing interest in animation this is a classic you ought to watch. Now if you're really into animation and even more so anime, you ABSOLUTELY have to watch this phenomenon that pretty much introduced Japanese animation to the world. I am a huge fan of the original manga, and of course the movie had to be an extremely simplified version but I think they managed to do a amazing job to maintain as much of the story as they could. 30 years later it is still as good as when it came out.",10,0,1,3 January 2019
The Maze Runner," The poor man's Hunger Games; moderately entertaining
",The poor man's Hunger Games. Moderately entertaining nonetheless,6,0,0,31 December 2018
Inglourious Basterds," I thought I'd enjoy it more, especially (usually) being a Tarantino fan
","This is an opinion that makes me very unpopular among my friends but I have to say I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would. But it's still a must-see for any Tarantino fan; for one, just to make your own opinion and two, for Christoph Waltz's awesome performance.",6,1,1,29 December 2018
Underworld," Not the most original but gets the job done to entertain
","There's no question they really tried to replicate the Matrix vibe here, especially considering it came out shortly after. But I liked it then and after just re-watching the Extended edition, I still think it's quite well-done and mighty entertaining if you just take it for the mindless spectacle it's supposed to be. Nothing original but efficient, though I have to admit some special effects did not age very well.",7,1,1,3 February 2019
Captain Marvel," Really wanted to like it more, it's just ok
","So I was hoping this would be a great movie and I could write a review telling misogynists to shut up because it's fantastic to have a strong female superhero as a lead character. Alas, in that regard Wonder Woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole.
The acting is not that great between Brie Larson's poor performance and the prosthetic/GCI on Samuel L. Jackson that makes him look younger but also gives him an expressionless wooden appearance. There are very obvious plot holes (like, wait, how did they know to do that?) and the pacing is very uneven; there are a few parts during which I didn't feel engaged at all.
On the plus side it does fairly well as an origin story, and there is that Marvel level of polish in special effects and editing. All in all, it might be a necessary introduction to Captain Marvel for Avengers End Game, but it is probably the weakest MCU movie to date.",6,189,357,18 March 2019
Coraline," A wonderful work of animation and a great story for both adults and children alike
","A wonderful work of animation and a great story for both adults and children alike, though it might get a bit scary for the youngest ones.",9,0,1,30 December 2018
Alien: Resurrection," This movie was made too early
","If Whedon wrote it and Jeunet directed it later in their careers, with not only more experience in their respective styles but also the professional credibility and weight to push for their exact vision, this could have been a great movie. Each Alien installment has chosen a completely different genre angle and this could have been a great gore/satire take on it. Unfortunately it is just trying to be a little bit of everything and doesn't succeed at any of it. Also what they tried to go for would have benefited from more modern visual effects, another argument for wishing this had been made at least 10 years later. As a standalone sci-fi flick it would have been decent for its time but it just doesn't hold up to the 3 previous ones in the franchise. RIP(ley), franchise!",5,0,1,13 June 2020
World War Z," I'm sick of the zombie craze and this would make a great final addition to the genre... for a while
","At this point, between the TV shows, the books, the games and movies, I'm a little sick of the whole zombie thing. I think it is time for the trend to fade from popular culture until its probable return in a few decades. And I think World War Z would be a great closing product. While the plot/storyline has nothing new to offer, good acting, great special effects and plenty of action make it quite entertaining.",7,0,0,30 December 2018
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," One of the better rom coms out there
","Rom coms are my guilty pleasure and I admit most of them are not that great or even funny. This one has the right balance of humor, good acting, silliness and sappy romance. Highly recommended if you're feeling down!",7,0,0,13 June 2019
The 13th Warrior," Much better than what the critics said but should have been amazing
","This is a great action adventure movie that should have been much better. The initial plan was to have the opening 5 minute sequence be the first half of an epic 3 hour long movie a la Lord of the Rings and what a movie this would have turned out to be! And yes I compare it to LOTR because even if it's not a Fantasy movie it should not be considered a historical one, as it was never intended to be. Bonus: the smartest scene explaining how a character overcomes the language barrier I've seen in a movie.",7,5,7,29 December 2018
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Entertaining action fantasy flick that's not very good but really not that bad
","Nowhere near as terrible as the critics say, even though as with many video game franchises it had the potential to be a lot better.",5,1,2,30 December 2018
Ted," Extremely funny if absolutely non-PC humor is your thing but also touching at times
","Very funny (if this type of humor doesn't offend you), but also touching at times. Good CGI makes it easy to think there really is a talking teddy bear walking around but so does Mark Wahlberg's performance.",8,0,0,30 December 2018
Knives Out," Original, stylish and fun
",Very fun murder-mystery movie that doesn't necessarily try to keep you guessing until the end but still manages to have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The excellent acting is a delight even if I have a really hard time not thinking of James Bond when I see Daniel Craig... he could at least change his hair or something!,8,0,1,31 March 2020
Creed," Best Rocky movie in a very long time
","Even better than the previous one (Rocky Balboa), which was the best Rocky since the original one.",8,4,6,29 December 2018
Constantine," Very underrated. Any sci-fi fan should watch it
","Very underrated in my opinion. Keanu Reeves is, well, Keanu Reeves but all other actors are giving great performances. Sci-Fi fans should definitely like this noire-ish take on the genre.",8,1,3,29 December 2018
Rise of the Guardians," Not be the best DreamWorks movie but still entertaining
",It may not be the best DreamWorks movie but still entertaining.,7,0,0,30 December 2018
About Time," Very lovely comedy
",Nothing to rave about but pretty cute rom-com overall.,7,1,2,30 December 2018
Insomnia," A great thriller; highly recommend
","This is the perfect definition of an underrated movie: great plot, haunting location, Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and Christopher Nolan. And yet I never heard of it until recently. Yes it might not be the best work for any of them but it's still really good. Granted, I haven't seen the original but as a standalone it's one of the best thrillers I've seen recently.",9,0,0,29 April 2020
Aquaman," A lot more fun than I expected
","I really am in the mood to hate-watch a movie and going down the list of potential candidates but I keep enjoying them a lot more than expected. This is hands down the most fun DC movie I've watched to date, and the only one with amazing special effects consistent throughout the whole movie. It's fun action entertainment with very well done 'superhero' type fight scenes (again, the best DC has offered so far). Yes, this Aquaman has very little in common with the comics but let's be real, that can only be an improvement (also everybody speaks English under the sea?). And to all the reviewers calling Jason Momoa 'fat', excuse me while I lol a bit, m'kay?",7,1,13,17 April 2020
500 Days of Summer," If you've ever been in love, it should be very easy to relate to this great movie
","Watched it because it was recommended by a friend. My friends know me well because even if this hit way too close to home, this movie totally captures how it is to be in this guy's situation without being overly dramatic. Maybe if you've never felt that way this movie won't do it for you but I loved it, even if I usually find Deschanel annoying.",9,0,0,28 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Trying too hard to match the first one; while unsuccessful, still very entertaining
","Definitely not as good as the first one. They tried too hard, probably due to the pressure to equal or surpass the success of the original considering the much larger budget. Many jokes feel forced; however it still mostly has a large amount of good moments!",7,1,1,29 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Everything a super hero movie should be
","Everything a super hero movie should be! Fun, funny, visually impressive and with plenty of original touches here and there.",10,3,6,1 January 2019
Zodiac," Great detective story based on true facts
","The regular movie is already long and I just watched the extended Director's Cut... that's definitely not for everybody. For a serial killer themed movie, the murders are not at the center; rather, everything revolves around the investigation from cops and journalists. It is slow-paced and feels closer to real life so some people might find it boring. But Fincher once again manages to make it interesting from beginning to end.",7,0,0,17 February 2019
Cloverfield," Still entertaining many years later
","Apparently this is a love it or hate it movie but I just enjoyed it. I remember liking it less when it came out but watching it now I found it surprisingly entertaining; it definitely kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time (even though I sort of remembered what happens), which is really all that movie wanted to achieve. Yes, you need huge suspension of disbelief but seriously, when is it not the case with sci-fi movies?",7,1,1,19 May 2020
Silent Hill," Forget about it being a game adaptation, it's a very good horror flick
","As of this writing, I do not think there is any movie that is a good adaptation from a video game. But I've actually never played the Silent Hill games. So I took this movie at face value and while it's not award-worthy, it is still a very well done horror flick I recommend if you're into this.",7,1,1,30 December 2018
Ready Player One," Very Spielberg, but in this case it works, especially if you're an 80s/90s kid
","This movie was made for nerds like me who grew up on pop culture from the 80s and 90s. It's very Spielberg, but in this case, it works!",9,0,2,1 January 2019
The Adventures of Tintin," More fun than I thought it would be
",More fun than I thought it would be. 3D animation was the perfect way to bring Tintin to life. Visually stunning.,8,0,0,29 December 2018
The Expendables," A missed opportunity for a huge hit not using the all star 80's action movie cast in a 2010 context
","If this movie had been made in the 80s with this cast, it would have been the biggest hit ever. Being made now though, they should have treated it differently to make it the over-the-top action movie it should have been. Big missed opportunity.",5,0,0,30 December 2018
Alien," Classic movie that defined the space sci-fi horror genre
","I've seen this movie many times before but just watched the Director's Cut for the first time. Besides a couple of scenes with very dated special effects, it has aged very well and remains a classic that set up all the rules for this type of movie. Younger generations may think it's a bunch of predictable, overused tropes but they should keep in mind this is the movie that inspired everything else they might have seen!
Having watched the original Blade Runner recently to prepare for Blade Runner 2049, it's also interesting to notice how much of the atmosphere and gritty elements/shots in Alien help mold what would become another genre-defining movie for Ridley Scott.",9,2,3,9 June 2019
Horrible Bosses," Great little comedy, funnier than expected
",It doesn't pretend to be award worthy or anything and it is great at what it does. Excellent chemistry between the cast helps a lot.,8,0,1,4 January 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Not as good as the first one but still entertaining
",Not as good as the first one and far from The Avengers but still pretty entertaining!,7,0,1,31 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Cool pew pew bang boom space action flick...
","Which is sadly what Star Wars has been reduced to.
All the magic is gone and it's now your basic Hollywood CGI-heavy space action superproduction, so if that's what you expect from this and nothing else, it's entertaining enough. In true (new) Star Wars fashion there are a few very corny moments, some that just downright make no sense but it's cool Rey got to go to space Burning Man.",7,4,13,19 March 2020
Pacific Rim," The best live action anime (that's not adapted from an actual anime) ever made. If that's not your thing, skip it
","No matter how thin (dumb?) the plot may be, it is to date the most visually impressive cinematographic entertainment ever made. If there is one movie to see in Digital IMAX 3D and all that, that's the one! I love action and special effects but there is so much here that at times it's almost too much. Still, I grew up reading manga and watching anime and I'd say Del Toro made the first ever manga/anime live action movie; nothing that has been done before can compare. So yeah, if that's not your thing, skip it.",8,0,0,30 December 2018
The Devil Wears Prada," Entertaining formulaic comedy
",Nothing exceptional but quite entertaining comedy that follows all the tropes to the letter. Great acting helps a lot though.,7,0,0,5 January 2019
Forrest Gump," A classic everyone over the age of 10 should see
",There is nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't been said. A timeless classic I watched a dozen times and I love introducing younger people to.,10,1,2,29 December 2018
10 Things I Hate About You," Very 90s teen comedy that's fairly enjoyable
","Being a teen in the 90s too, I regret not watching that when it came out as I probably would have been to relate to and enjoy it even more. Still, it brought back good memories and even if the story is not all that original and quite predictable, the cast makes it very enjoyable from beginning to end!",7,1,1,16 February 2019
Nightcrawler," Excellent thriller with fantastic acting
","The plot, directing and pacing is excellent but it's really Jake Gyllenhaal's performance that brings this movie to the next level. He is so good as this weirdly disturbing sociopath I surprised myself muttering 'so creepy' a couple of times watching this alone at home. Ok, maybe entering week 8 of quarantine has made me overly emotional, but still this is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time.",9,2,2,27 April 2020
Oblivion," This very good sci-fi movie could have been great but they only scratched the surface
","Once again I disagree with critics. I thought it was a very good sci-fi movie. The only complaint I have is I wish they had explored a bit more in depth the various, interesting things that happen toward the end.",7,1,2,30 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great movie, especially for Queen fans
","I was never a true fan but still really like Queen since I was a teenager so I really appreciated the movie. Now as a movie, it certainly has flaws but seeing the story of Queen unfolding, experiencing how the songs came to be and getting a peek at who Freddie Mercury was behind the curtain is highly entertaining!",8,2,2,26 January 2019
Bird Box," Once again I disagree with most critics, not surprising anymore
","This was a fantastic thriller with a vaguely sci-fi premise, and it's perfect the way it is. There is plenty happening throughout the movie, great character development from the main protagonist, who cares if there is no 'real' explanation of the premise (which is just the reason for events to start), and who cares if the book is better or worse. Great acting, directing and score to top it off. I guess if a movie that has the slightest mention of sci-fi doesn't have crazy special effects, lots of explosions, and is reduced to a succession of 2 second shots it won't please the masses these days...",8,0,0,16 June 2020
Watchmen," Different and original take on the superhero genre
",This is a very different take on the superhero movie genre and it's fantastic. The story line and characters are extremely well-written (thanks to the original material?) and even if you're sick of all the Marvel and DC movies I still recommend you give this one a try.,9,1,1,30 December 2018
The Bourne Identity," This first Bourne movie was a welcome refresh of the spy action thriller genre
",This was a refreshing take on the spy action thriller movie that helped re-set the genre's standards for the following 2 decades. Matt Damon was perfectly cast in the role.,9,1,1,29 December 2018
Baby Driver," Actual good action movie for the Fast & Furious generation
",Giving the Fast & Furious generation an actual great action movie! A few cliches but an awesome soundtrack.,7,1,1,29 December 2018
Justice League," I can't believe DC managed to make super hero movies boring
",C minus for effort I guess. I can't believe DC managed to make super hero movies boring. They did succeed in one thing: Aquaman is not comically campy like in the comics. Instead they made him an unpleasant cocky asshole. Cool.,5,0,13,1 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I wish I had an 11th star to give
","I read the book for the first time when I was 10 so I had been waiting for this movie for a very, very long time. With apprehension. But I am glad they waited so long to make it, as the result is an absolute masterpiece that will satisfy even the most hardcore Tolkien fans.",10,1,2,29 December 2018
Man of Steel," Definitely better than other Superman movies and quite an impressive spectacle.
","Yes, it's another reboot/origin story for Superman and a bit too gritty at times for a Superman movie but it is definitely better than Superman Returns and quite an impressive spectacle. Also Henry Cavill makes a perfect Superman.",8,1,1,30 December 2018
The Revenant," Good but not great; beautiful cinematography though.
","The locations, visuals and overall atmosphere are doing a fantastic job conveying the emotions the director had in mind. Di Caprio and Hardy are also giving great acting performances as usual. However the not so great plot and very unrealistic moments are unfortunately lowering the quality of this movie to basically a 'Die Hard: Snow Country' at times. It also uselessly drags on too often and they could have easily shaved off 20-25 min without losing much.",7,1,1,25 April 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Beyond excellent. Surpassed all my expectations!
","Even though I am a big Marvel fan and animation fan, I never really liked Marvel animated shows or movies, so I completely disregarded this when it came out. All my friends were praising and recommending it so I finally listened to them... and boy am I glad I did (and my friends know me well!)
This movie managed to take familiar characters and stories and do something extremely original with them. It's enthralling, trippy, fun, touching and very funny all at once. It's also an absolute visual treat and the voice actors are impeccably on point.
Unless you're prone to epilepsy (I'm actually serious about that), I see no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie!",10,0,1,20 April 2019
Wanted," When dumb but fun and visually good works
","This is definitely a ridiculous movie but it knows it and doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's mindless, fun action with great visual style and if you just take it at face value you will be greatly entertained!",7,0,1,31 December 2018
We're the Millers," Predictable, cheesy, sometimes funny, mildly entertaining
","Typical predictable comedy, a bit cheesy at times but with quite a few funny moments as well! Entertaining.",6,0,0,30 December 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," More rom than com but I'm ok with that
",I wasn't sure about this movie in the first 15 minutes but then it became very good. Was recommended as rom-com but it's a lot more rom than com and I'm actually ok with that.,7,1,1,29 December 2018
Monsters vs. Aliens," Entertaining and surprisingly, maybe more for grown ups than kids
",It might not be the best but it's definitely one of the funniest Dreamworks animated films in my opinion as many jokes seem a bit more for grown ups rather than kids. I also found it quite entertaining overall.,7,2,3,30 December 2018
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," One of my favorite rom-coms
","I just re-watched it recently and it's holding up well. Very funny and touching, this is definitely still one of my favorite rom-coms.",8,0,0,29 December 2018
Face_Off," Good but would have been a lot better if it had been a Hong Kong-made John Woo movie.
","More John Woo-esque than his previous US movies, but I wish they had let him make it 100% Woo instead of the weaker Woo-lywood style he's been forced into.",7,0,1,29 December 2018
Dark City," Loved it when it came out but hasn't aged well at all
",I loved this movie so much when it came out. It hasn't aged that well though and so I had to knock 2 stars off my original rating after watching it recently. Still worth watching for any sci-fi fan.,6,1,4,1 January 2019
Dunkirk," I don't really like war movies and this one did not make me change my mind
","I can see why people liked it, it's very well made. I still don't feel like there was much of an interesting plot though. Personally, I don't really like war movies and this one didn't have anything exceptional to change my feelings about the genre. On the contrary, it cemented my stance on the topic: if I didn't like this apparently amazing war movie, I probably won't really like any of them.",5,0,0,1 January 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Much better than the previous versions!
","Ok yes, we JUST had a few Spider Man movies when this came out. But that doesn't mean this one is not good. In fact, to me, it is way better than the 3 previous ones. It is more faithful to the comics and Andrew Garfield makes a better Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Too bad some of the special effects are not up to what was available in 2012.",7,2,2,30 December 2018
The Lego Movie," Expected a basic kids movie and was pleasantly surprised
",Kids will love it but the writing and layered humor will also please most adults. Very well done!,9,2,2,29 December 2018
Aliens," Great example of a sequel of equal quality as the original
","It was a great idea to take the story and universe of the original Alien movie and give it to a completely different director to take it in an opposite direction. While the first movie defined the space sci-fi horror genre, Aliens is the classic film set up all the rules for all the sci-fi action flicks for years to follow.
I just watched the Director's Cut for the first and while it makes for a very long movie, all the added scenes are welcome and don't feel out of place. I highly recommend giving it a try!",9,2,5,9 June 2019
Now You See Me," Fantastic stupid-over-the-top entertainment!
","This movie knew exactly what it wanted to be from the start and it delivered. It's a preposterous, unrealistic, thrilling non-stop joy ride from beginning to end and I loved every ridiculous second of it. The acting. directing and plot twists are perfect to achieve the end result; this is by far the most entertaining movie I've seen in months (and I've watched A LOT of movies during 2020 lockdown)!",8,0,0,28 June 2020
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men movie to date
",Best X-Men movie to date. They did a very good job at tying all the previous ones together nicely!,8,1,1,31 December 2018
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Original storytelling, impressive special effects and great cast make the perfect comic book/videogame nerd movie
","It's been a while since I watched it and I forgot how much I love it. If like me you're into comic books and video games, you will absolutely have an amazing time. And even if you don't, you might find it silly but the great cast, original storytelling and top notch special effects should keep you extremely entertained!",10,14,23,31 December 2018
Inside Out," Another great Pixar for both children and adults
","At this point there is no point in discussing the quality of animation in Pixar movies. With this one, they make another very funny and touching story that can be enjoy by all.",9,3,7,1 January 2019
Yesterday," Original and light 'what if?' movie with a rom com vibe
","I really don't understand the low ratings and bad reviews about this movie.
It may not be a masterpiece but it's a very well done 'what if?' movie with rom com feel good vibes. It's entertaining, funny, well acted with an original premise and welcome light-hearted tale in the current age of gritty, dark, viloent action movie landscape. Take it for what it is and have a great time!",7,0,0,19 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The perfect conclusion to what the MCU started 11 years ago.
","The Infinity Gauntlet trilogy was one of my most cherished comic books growing up. I would have never imagined it would become a movie one day. With each movie after the original Iron Man that truly started shaping the MCU, it was clear Marvel was taking the direction of adapting my beloved comic to the big screen. I was very apprehensive but they surpassed everything I could dream of. After some 30 MCU movies, they got the formula down to a science with the right amounts of action, funny, epic, touching and overall awesomeness to please most people and the result is a memorable experience that is a perfect conclusion of this generation of MCU. Bravo, and from that little kid who didn't have much besides comics growing up: thank you!",10,2,7,19 May 2019
The Butterfly Effect," A LOT better than critics led me to believe

No Country for Old Men," First half is great; not sure what happened with the second half
","Coen Brothers movies are always strange and polarizing. Some I hate, some I love but I understand why some people hate the ones I love. Overall cinematography and acting here is great throughout. But while the first half is setting up a pretty fantastic thriller, the second half is losing itself in some uncertain message it's trying to convey and falls flat; like a really bad date, I was as bored by the end as I was exciting in the first few minutes.",7,0,1,26 April 2020
District 9," Original sci-fi flick
",Refreshing sci-fi. Sharlto Copley is awesome as Wikus.,9,3,4,29 December 2018
Toy Story 4," Was ready to be disappointed. Glad I wasn't!
","I thought Toy Story 3 was the perfect ending to the story and wrapped up nicely a fantastic trilogy. I was very upset when I heard they were working on a 4th installment and immediately thought that's when the franchise would jump the shark in the name of greed. However, they managed to do an amazing job here and keep the magic alive yet one more time. Highly recommended for the whole family!",9,1,4,6 October 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Decent enough but they're not even trying to hide the fact they're milking the franchise

Avengers: Infinity War," MCU at its best. Had huge expectations and it completely delivered
",I've read the original comic book trilogy countless times as a kid and I was trying real hard to keep my expectations low for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be disappointed. But it totally delivered and is a worthy culmination of what Marvel started with the first Iron Man movie.,10,1,2,29 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One of the rare movies I did not finish watching
","I've liked Tarantino since I saw Reservoir Dogs in theaters (I know, showing my age here). I didn't care much for Jackie Brown and was not super into Inglorious Basterds (except for Christopher Waltz amazing performance) but otherwise, always a pretty solid director.
Which is why I don't understand what happened here. After an hour and a half or plain nonsense I had enough and just stopped watching. Reading other reviews, half of them seem to hint at some great conclusion, the rest further confirm there is no point to it until the end. There are just too many good movies to watch out there and I have so very little time I am not ready to give this another try, sadly.",1,4,11,30 December 2019
Gone Girl," Depressing but beautiful and riveting at the same time
","This is great, great Fincher. Pike's performance is excellent and Affleck never ceases to surprise me with how good he can be in some movies when I've seen how bad he's been in others. Utterly depressing and beautiful at the same time; I loved it!",8,1,2,29 December 2018
Mr. Nobody," Brilliant but complex and strange movie that is not for everyone
","This is a very well done but also very complex and strange movie. If you get it, or at least if complicated movies that require full focus and reflection are your thing, you're most likely going to love it. If not, you might want to skip it. Everything is brilliant, from the writing to directing to acting. There are a hundred ways to interpret the movie but romantic me likes to see it as a tale about true love. I would also recommend watching the extended version; yes it adds 15 minutes to an already long movie but it's worth it.",9,1,2,2 January 2019
Django Unchained," Tarantino at its best
","Well, it's a good Tarantino. If that's your thing, you'll have a good time (I did). If not, better move along I guess.",9,1,4,30 December 2018

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A lot better than what critics say; funny, charming and touching

Stardust," I had no idea it would be THAT good. Great movie for all to enjoy
","Starts as a little silly fairy tale and sort of becomes awesome along the way. This is definitely the kind of movie I would have loved as a kid! Ah, who am I kidding, I loved it as a grown man.",8,3,3,30 December 2018
I Am Legend," Very good movie, but watch both endings
","No spoilers, but the ending is apparently very polarizing. Maybe that's why they made an Alternate Ending version, which pleases more people. The very strange thing for me is that I find the Alternate version to be a lot better and make a lot more sense BUT I tend to like the overall vibe of the regular ending. So I'd recommend watching both versions of the ending and be the judge. That said, regardless of the ending the move is very well worth the watch: great story, cinematography and performance from Will Smith. Special effects are still holding up 13 years later. Watching now during the 2020 quarantine gives an extra eerie feel to the experience as well... really hope this comment if read in the future will be seen as amusingly outdated (fingers crossed!).",8,2,2,18 June 2020
A Quiet Place," Very original and unexpectedly great
",A fantastic movie that came out of nowhere; it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and few movies do that. Krasinski proves to be as talented a director as he is an actor; Blunt and Millicent Simmonds give equally brilliant performances.,9,1,1,29 December 2018
22 Jump Street," As silly and funny as the first one
",I wouldn't say it's better than the first one like most critics seem to think but it's as good. There are some very funny moments but I admit the part that really got me laughing was the awesome ending credits sequence.,7,1,2,1 January 2019
Amadeus," A masterpiece of a movie
","I just finished watching the Director's Cut, which I had never seen before. It may be 3 hours long but so worth it. It's rare for me to like this type of movie, even less for so many scenes to get strong emotional reactions from me; so it's no surprise that it always makes the lists of best movies of all time. It may or may not be historically accurate but it is an amazing story nonetheless. I am not familiar with the rest of the 2 main actors' careers but I am willing to bet they never came close again to the magnificent performance they give here.
As a note, I am also willing to bet that if this movie was made now, everyone would have some sort of silly fake British accent. I don't know why this is the trend these days and this movie clearly shows how unnecessary it it.",10,0,0,14 January 2019

Unknown," Good Bourne-like entertainment
","Your basic, entertaining action thriller if you need your dose of Jason Bourne without watching a Bourne movie.",7,2,2,29 December 2018
Gran Torino," Great, but with some issues
","I'm a bit torn about this movie. it's a great story and Eastwood is perfect for the role and delivers his usual great performance. However the rest of the cast is terribly amateurish, which greatly diminishes the overall quality of the final product. Still very much worth the watch and I regret waiting for so long before giving it a go.",7,1,2,28 December 2018
Hero," One of my favorite movies of all time
","The cinematography alone makes it worth watching even if you're not into this kind of Asian action movies. But it's also a well-written story and beautifully acted. I find it far superior to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and don't understand why it didn't achieve the same international fame.",10,1,2,29 December 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," I must have bad tastes because I liked it; even more than the previous one
","I've gotten used to disagree with critics. I guess I have bad tastes or something, but hey, seems like I get to enjoy more movies than they do with my plebeian standards! In any case, I found the sequel even better than the first one.",8,4,5,31 December 2018
Hidden Figures," Great movie for all to watch, inspired by a true story
","A true story worth being told and watched. Great performances from all but at times the over-dramatization makes segregation a bit too theatrical, which takes away some of its harshness rather than emphasize its injustice as it was undoubtedly intended. Still, a great movie for all audiences.",8,0,4,29 December 2018

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," I should have liked it more but it has too many issues for my taste
","I really wanted to like it more than this. The animation is very well done, the dialogues are well written and acted.
I can usually turn my 'adult' brain off when confronted to any form of entertainment that's 'for the whole family' but for some reason here I couldn't. I definitely had an issue with the topic itself and felt uncomfortable with a movie revolving around the 'problem' of having too much food because there are in fact too many problems in the World with hunger. It's a silly thing and I usually don't over analyze this type of movie, but something in the way this movie was made/written just made it happen.",6,0,2,30 December 2018
Big Hero 6," Perfect movie for kids ages 7-77 who are into super heroes, anime and Disney movies
","This is a great mashup of different genre: super hero movies, anime, Disney movies. Even if the plot is not the most original, the writing, directing, stunning animation and great voice acting make it a perfect movie for everyone, young or otherwise, who is into super heroes, anime or Disney movies. But others will surely enjoy it too!",10,3,3,1 January 2019
Mulholland Drive," Not my kind of movie I guess

The Imitation Game," Good movie but an over-dramatization of the life of a brilliant man
","Alan Turing was a brilliant man and he lived an interesting but challenging life; his story most definitely deserved to be told. While the movie in itself is entertaining, it is taking too many liberties with what really happened for the sake of dramatization and it's taking away from the gravitas of the real Turing's life and the undeniable impact his work had on the world of computing.
There are some questionable choices in the editing (weird uses of archive footage here and there for example) and while Cumberbatch offers an amazing performance it sometimes makes even more obvious the weakness of some of the other actors.",8,0,0,19 January 2019
Here Comes the Boom," Better than expected; funny comedy that should satisfy MMA fans as well

",Can't believe this movie totally flew under my radar! I went in knowing nothing about it and I absolutely loved it!

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Strange, unpretentious, smart, and sweet. Overall wonderful.
","I saw this movie when it came out and really liked it. At the time, I had never experienced a relationship with a heartbreaking end. But re-watching this now adds an additional layer and personal connection that only makes it better. If you like realistic love stories with a bit of a fantastic twist, just make this your next movie. 'Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all?'; what if you could actually decide to act on it? I honestly don't know now, if given the option to forget.",9,0,0,18 May 2020

Up," Great Pixar for all to enjoy
","The biggest issue with this movie is that the opening sequence is probably one of the best of ANY movie I've seen (animated or otherwise).

","First, you have to watch The Room so that you fully understand what this is all about. The Room is better watched in certain conditions, see my review on here for more details.
James Franco did a great job directing this movie but he's absolutely fantastic as Tommy Wiseau. And the all-star cast doing cameos left and right only make the whole thing better.
The post credit scene (at the very very end) is almost better than any MCU one!
Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates The Room for what is.",8,0,0,16 July 2019
The Fountain," I don't understand why people love it so much
",I would give zero Stars if it was possible. This was an absolutely terrible waste of the 45 minutes I tried to power through before I gave up. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it if you consider the usual reviews about this being an 'intelligent' movie but I have seen movies that have confused me in the past and required second watching and thinking hard about them that I still enjoyed and considered good movies. To each their own I guess.,1,3,7,29 December 2018
Zombieland," Original, stupidly funny and an absolute fun ride
","I am sick and tired of zombie shows/movies and really didn't want to watch another one but this was highly recommended by friends who know me well. Am I glad I listened to them!

","Ugh, another Batman/Joker story... seems like they keep alternating those with Superman reboots. I was never a fan to start with (Marvel comics > DC) but after so many movie/tv/cartoon iterations of the tale, I really didn't care about this movie.
Still, considering the raving reviews I had to check it out, and am I glad I did!
From the writing to the cinematography and formidable performance by Joaquin Phoenix this is a fantastic movie, even without the Batman/Joker context.
If this movie came out years before this franchise's fatigue it would have blown everybody's mind (mine included). Believe the hype and go watch it, you won't regret it!",9,4,7,30 December 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Great sci-fi that could have been even better
","Great movie overall spoiled by a lame ending; it would have been a 9 or even 10 Stars in my book otherwise. Still, any sci-fi fan should enjoy it.",8,1,1,31 December 2018
Whiplash," Intense movie, phenomenal J.K. Simmons but unrealistic
","This movie should please a wide audience of non-musicians. I am not a musician but I've seen movies based on things I know very well and it's always exaggerated and unrealistic and it usually bugs me more than other people; I can easily imagine how real musicians may dislike this one.
The directing and acting are great (although J.K. Simmons steals the whole show) as are cinematography and sound. However the whole premise is wildly unrealistic, and the moral of the story 'to be great you need to be pushed beyond your limits' is a tired trope that has often been done in a better way than here.
On a personal note, I hate bullies with a passion and there can never be a 'but it's for a good reason' excuse for bullying.",7,33,48,10 February 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," Unpopular opinion: I did not really like it and expected better from Scorsese

Kong: Skull Island," It was made to be entertaining, and it is.
","This was never made to be a masterpiece, just a piece of entertaining spectacle. Also, setting up the stage for future 'big monsters' movies. We'll see how successful they are with the latter but it is indeed mindless entertainment to be enjoyed with your brain turned off.
As a note, the trailer was extremely well done.",6,1,3,27 December 2019

","I'd love to be a snob like everyone else and say the original was better but I was a kid when I saw it so I don't remember it and I won't re-watch it just so I can hate on the remake. Yes, Kenneth Branagh seems to like himself a lot but in this case it fits with this version of Poirot. The movie overall is pretty well done with great performances from a pretty stellar cast. Recommended for anyone who wants to watch a great thriller and has never seen (or has forgotten) the original.",7,1,3,29 December 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Fast-paced, entertaining and fun. Great spin on a classic character!
","10 years later this movie hasn't aged one bit. It's non-stop action that's fun from beginning to end, with great acting from all. Not sure why the 'Sherlock Holmes purists' are so upset as I've read the books and seen many versions of the character and this version is in-line with the original material. Now as a non-native English speaker I can't really tell if Robert Downey Jr's British accent is really an issue but as far as everything else is concerned, it's probably my favorite Holmes version to date (sorry Cumberbatch fans!)",8,1,1,1 July 2019

Prometheus," Good attempt at reviving the Aliens universe

Vanilla Sky," This was a weird thriller... but I liked it!
","I remember liking it when I saw it way back then and I enjoyed it again upon recent viewing. I never knew it was a remake and still haven't seen the original so I can't compare but Vanilla Sky on its own is a pretty solid movie. It is very strange in its pacing and cinematography but it didn't bother me or felt boring as these exercises in style often do. Great thriller with very good acting performances overall, and unhinged Tom Cruise was the perfect guy for this crazy role in this crazy movie.",7,1,1,17 June 2020

Creed II," Predictable but entertaining; not as good as the first Creed
","Considering all the good reviews I was expecting better. It's very predictable and while the first Creed was a great Rocky successor, Creed 2 is basically a remake of Rocky 4. But as far as remakes go, it's not badly done and entertaining enough. It is however the kind of movie that really tells a franchise is at the end of the line and they should really stop making more at this point.",6,0,1,2 May 2019
The Emperor's New Groove," Not the usual Disney movie, not a bad thing
","Nostalgia for this one is strong on reddit; with all the praises, I had to watch it again. I liked it enough back then and while it's still good it's really not all that. Sure, it's a bit different from other Disney animated movies in humor and tone but there's still enough there to make it an unmistakable Disney flick.
I think the Lego movie for example (I know, not Disney) is a better example of a movie kids can appreciate at face value and parents won't suffer through it (hello Frozen 2) because they'll be able to enjoy the different layers.",7,0,1,20 February 2020
Blade Runner," A classic and absolute sci-fi masterpiece that defined what the Cyberpunk genre would be
","A sci-fi classic that set up the rules for cyberpunk genre in movies. Also in my top 10 of all time favorites.

","I guess if you're a fam of the whimsical style of Wes Anderson this is a great movie? Against public opinion, I don't think his movies live up to the hype and Fantastic Mr. Fox is no exception.
I salute the effort to bring old school stop motion back in style but Kubo and the Two Strings is orders of magnitude better for example. And while I can appreciate the usual Wes Anderson cinematography, I found it sorely lacking here. A resounding meh from me.",5,0,1,31 March 2020

","An absolutely epic conclusion to this fantastic trilogy. An perfect adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece, which set all the standards for Fantasy movies just like Tolkien did for Fantasy literature.",10,0,0,29 December 2018
Pitch Perfect," Another good quarantine-prompted surprise
","The only good point about being stuck at home is finally going down the 128 movies (as of today) I added to my watchlist over the years. I can't say a movie about an all-girl acapella college band sounds super appealing to me but I recently watched A Simple Favor and since, to my surprise, I really liked Anna Kendrick's performance I thought I might not completely hate Pitch Perfect. Even though it's a bit cliche and predictable at times, the characters (yes, Anna is great as expected) and fun musical numbers make this a very enjoyable piece of entertainment! I just learned they made 2 sequels... I don't think I'm ready for that but stranger things could happen if they extend the lockdown again.",7,0,0,15 April 2020
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Of course it's dumb but I get the appeal
","As a child of the 80s who's seen every other movie like this one it truly is bizarre I never managed to watch this cult-ish one until now. There is no denying this is a stupid movie and everything about it is not great: script, acting, etc. and I don't even think it was as self aware as something like a Big Trouble in Little China when it came out so it's hard to see it just like a joke movie. If I had seen it as a kid in 1989, I might have liked it and would still have fond memories of it, making it worth re-watching. Watching it now I still had some good nostalgia-induced laughs at some particularly ridiculous scenes and I had a good time overall. I would not necessarily recommend it to newer generations as a must-see from the 80s though.",7,0,0,30 June 2020
The Matrix," A classic that defined action sci-fi for the next century
",It is difficult to explain to those too young to remember the impact this movie had when it came out. It was unlike anything at the time and its influence is still present on a lot of sci-fi today. I happily watch it every time I get a chance to.,10,1,1,29 December 2018
Godzilla," A silly movie with decent special effects
",It's a Godzilla movie: silly with decent special effects. What else would you expect?,4,0,2,31 December 2018
Looper," I disagree with everyone apparently: I loved this take on the time travel concept!
","Unlike everyone else apparently, I really liked the concept, story, characters, and the movie as a whole. One of my new favorite sci-fi (and Bruce Willis) movies!",9,0,4,29 December 2018
Life," Nothing amazing but still one of the better space-horror movies I've seen
","Even though it can't escape certain cliches, it's still pretty well done. One of the better space-horror movies I've seen. On a side note I'm having a really hard time seeing Ryan Reynolds as anything other than Deadpool now so it's a bit of a bummer but that issue is 100% me and nothing to do with this movie.",7,1,2,1 January 2019
What We Do in the Shadows," A different kind of vampire movie
","This is a great mockumentary, especially if you like Taika Waititi's brand of humor. I'm glad this movie put him on the road that led him to direct the fantastic Thor: Ragnarok. If Spinal Tap meets Flight of the Conchords sounds good to you, go watch this right now!",8,1,2,16 April 2020
Deadpool," Redefining the genre
","I've seen it 3 times now and it's still as good as the first. time. Ryan Reynolds really pushed for this movie to happen in all the right ways and the result was a bit of a turning point for superhero movies, for the best. I originally wrote a review that was a bit crass and not really PC, totally in the spirit of this movie and it kept getting removed by moderation. If you feel you can understand the mods on this decision, do yourself a favor and go watch Green Lantern instead.",10,0,2,15 April 2020
Cloud Atlas," Usually not my kind of movie but its originality and great acting won me over
",I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I though I would! Very original with great acting performances all around.,8,0,1,30 December 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Came out of nowhere and turns out to be the best 'James Bond' movie in years!
",This was mighty entertaining! They even joke about it in the movie but this really is all good fun like the old Bond movies. Also Gazelle is the BEST ASSASSIN EVER.,8,1,3,31 December 2018
Easy A," Surprisingly well-written, funny and witty teen comedy with a great cast
","Another great recommendation from IMDb. I was expecting your mildly pleasant run-of-the-mill teen comedy but it's surprisingly well written, very funny and quite witty. It also benefits from a great cast.",8,0,0,2 January 2019
Fast Five," Best of the Franchise so far
","Let's be honest: I found this whole franchise and what it's about supremely dumb and uninteresting. But to be fair, this one is entertaining.",6,0,1,31 December 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Action on par with the first one, plot/storyline is superior in my opinion
","A great sequel to the first one and they did expend more on the (under)world the story takes place in, which made it a lot more interesting for me. Can't wait to see what they do with it in Chapter 3!",7,0,1,1 January 2019
Annihilation," Formulaic but entertaining sci-fi
",It can't escape certain genre cliches but all in all a good sci-fi flick.,7,0,2,29 December 2018
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Timeless classic everybody should watch
","Even if this type of comedy is not your thing, you should just watch it so that you finally understand where all these quotes you've heard before come from!",8,0,1,31 December 2018
Incredibles 2," Not as good as the first one, still fun
",Doesn't feel as original as the first one but it's still a lot of fun!,8,3,3,29 December 2018
Spectre," Ok action movie, mediocre for a James Bond
",Spectacular opening sequence followed by a 2h 10min decent though plot hole filled action film that could have been much better.,5,0,3,29 December 2018
Moon," Very well done and underrated sci-fi movie
",Very well done sci-fi thriller with amazing atmosphere. Mostly unknown but highly recommended.,8,0,1,29 December 2018
Her," Interesting concept and ideas but I didn't like the execution
","Very strange, this is usually the kind of movie that is right up my alley and I love. Interesting concept and ideas but I am not sure I am a big fan of how it was explored and executed. Excellent acting performance though.",6,0,1,31 December 2018
The Nice Guys," Great action-thriller comedy
",It's very well written and even better acted with Goslings and Crowe being perfectly cast here. Loses a star for overusing the happy coincidence trope that's a joke and helps the story at the same time.,7,1,2,13 January 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Most ludicrous, over-the-top, entertaining and fun spectacle
","This the best, most grandiose action spectacle ever made. It may be equaled someday but can never be topped, for the result would be far too ludicrous to be any good.
I sincerely hope they never make a sequel.",9,0,2,29 December 2018
Donnie Darko," I don't get the cult status of this movie
","I don't understand why this is such a cult flick. I usually like sci-fi, dark and weird movies. This one I found boring.",3,3,11,29 December 2018
The Proposal," A resounding meh
",I was told this was not your run of the mill Rom Com and it had a little something special. It doesn't. Just a resounding meh.,5,0,0,1 January 2019
Princess Mononoke," Probably my favorite Miyazaki
","Miyazaki movies are all amazing so it's hard to tell, but this might be my favorite.",10,1,1,29 December 2018
Up in the Air," The right amount of drama with great acting
",I thoroughly enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The right amount of drama with great acting.,7,0,0,30 December 2018
The Island," First half is fantastic, the second is awful
","The first half of the movie is amazing, close to 10 star. The rest... not so much.",5,3,5,29 December 2018
Furious 7," Most over the top of the franchise to date. Doesn't make it the best
","They topped everything they did in previous F&F I grant them that. It doesn't make it a good movie though, and certainly not the best of the series.",5,5,6,31 December 2018
