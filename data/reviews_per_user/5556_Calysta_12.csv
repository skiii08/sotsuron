Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worth watching
","As a fan of the original Star Wars movies, I was quite excited about the release of the prequels. However, being reliant upon the original success of the movie in order to revive the phenomenon sixteen years later was a bit of a stretch. It was hard to watch the movie without feeling reminiscent for some of the legendary classic characters; e.g Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca. In general, they didn't make such a bad effort, although the sequencing in later years will definitely look a bit strange.
The new cast of 'The Phantom Menace' did have an impossible task to live up to, and they should be commended for their efforts. Notably Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor. Jar Jar Binks was nothing more than an intrusion, but is still tolerable, and the return of R2-D2, Threepio and Yoda brings back fond memories. I did not however, encounter any stand out performances.Screenplay wise, I thought it was a little weak. It perhaps is a little tired after three Star Wars serials, but unlike 'The Blair Witch Project' there will be an audience to next movies that will hopefully by then turn a profit. Of course, the sound and special effects were excellent. This should mean automatic Oscar nominations. The score was pretty good as well, but nothing marvellous.It is without a doubt still watching for everyone. Good entertainment for the generally undemanding circles. But if the movie you're after requires a bit more than special effects and battle scenes, you'd be doing yourself a favour to pick a different movie. Personally, I hope George Lucas gives up before he embarrasses himself like the makers of 'The Blair Witch Project'. Rating: 8/10 (And that's being a bit generous)",Null,0,0,3 January 2000
The Sound of Music," My favourite movie of all time!
","Watching my Mother dancing and singing to the songs of 'The Sound of Music' at the age of five was incredibly disturbing. It was seven years before anyone was able to sit me down in front of the T.V to the musical during the annual telecast in Sydney. Almost to my horror, I was falling in love with the musical. More than two years later, not a single movie has been able to pass it in my favourite movies stakes. I have made judgemental mistakes with great movies. Greats like 'Casablanca', 'The African Queen' and 'The Wizard of Oz' have originally also been frowned upon. 'The Sound of Music' expanded my horizons on the movie world. I eventually went on to view non-musical classics as a result of this single movie, and now old classic movies have become a genuine passion. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote their greatest work in the form of their last musical, despite the fact it was 'Carousel' that was their favourite. Although the changes made from the original stage production have now been evident in the arrival of the excellent musical currently playing in Sydney, much have been for the better. Throughout their career, the duo created immortal musicals, but in story, song and film, 'The Sound of Music' surpasses 'The King and I', 'Oklahoma!', 'Carousel' and 'South Pacific' in all aspects. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, 'The Sound of Music', 'My Favourite Things', 'Do-Re-Mi' or 'Edelweiss'. Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken novice nun turned governess, who should have taken out the oscar that year. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965.Yes, there are sugary elements in the movie that cannot be denied. But this movie has never been reliant upon sex, violence or drugs to make it one of the best things to come out of Hollywood. It can be appreciated truly for what it is, pure art, talent and spirit. It is not a real perception of the world nowadays, but for all the joy it brings, who cares?It was the last movie I expected to love as a fourteen year old. It was also the first movie I watched in seven years that could manage to make me shed tears, and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled.
'Singin' In the Rain' is the only other contender to the title of 'The greatest movie ever made'. Whatever its flaws, 'The Sound of Music' is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.Rating: 10/10",10,204,299,12 January 2000
Citizen Kane," Do we all think it is the greatest motion picture?
","A brilliant cast, with Joseph Cotten serving brilliantly as the right hand man of Welles. In turn, Orson Welles in his most famous role, or perhaps one of the most famous characters in all of Hollywood's history. Screenplay of Academy Award calibre was penned by the leading man and the director.
RKO studios, although doomed against the fatale of other Hollywood competition, was so confident about the picture that it was released with the promotional tagline 'Everyone's talking about it!' And although RKO became defunct, not every studio goes down with nine Astaire-Rogers films, let alone 'Citizen Kane'.Indeed people are still talking about the film with good reason. But ask the typical teenager about my age the most famous film ever made and they're more likely to come out with 'The Wizard of Oz' or 'Gone With the Wind'. That is, if they don't come out with 'American Beauty' or 'The Sixth Sense' first. In 1941, 'Citizen Kane' received its accolades, but Orson Welles was an ignored and underrated Tinseltown figure, which justifies 'The Third Man' never being nominated best picture. 'How Green Was My Valley' may have been the winner of the coveted Best Picture that year, but it didn't take out the number one spot on the AFI's controversial list, and it wouldn't take the Oscar today if the Awards occurred again. The underlying problem is that even 'Citizen Kane' itself may have been blown too much out of proportion for its own good. As a fourteen year old, I am more inclined to pick the AFI's number 98th listed film on the Top 100 'Bringing Up Baby' as my favourite film of the 1930s and 1940s.'Citizen Kane's' theme is certainly a powerful, compelling and thought provoking one. The idea that death comes at a moment of dissatisfaction probably rings true for humans, the idea of never finding what is lost and never understanding fully exactly what was lost is all probably true as well. And if 'Citizen Kane' is that good, why is there such a problem with it being stated as the best film ever made?The underlying answer is likely to be that mainstream audience, and the fewer who indulge in classic film, cannot take heavy, intense drama as easily screwball comedy. As I would classify myself as one of those people, I would never leave 'Citizen Kane' off my personal greatest films list, but I could never speak of it as the best movie of all time.Film professionals may state 'Kane' is without a doubt the best movie ever made, but more people would be able to recognise the tune 'Over the Rainbow' than understand the irony if someone dropped dead smashing a crystal ball uttering 'Rosebud'.Rating: 8/10",8,1,2,23 April 2000
Armageddon," Yawn...
","Huh? Was there supposed to be emotion explored and detailed in the inner depths of this movie? I don't think I could relate because I fell asleep.
That's just my two cents, but my personal feel towards the movie is another glossy box office hit which is sustained only through special effects and giant asteroids with extremely deadly pulverising effects. It also has a theme song which makes me wish that the asteroids actually did hit the earth. Rating: That won't be necessary.",2,0,1,22 January 2000
Gone with the Wind," A Beautiful Epic
","Margaret Mitchell's civil war classic in the immortal film of 1939 has been for a long time now, a firm favourite of mine. Without a doubt, it is one of the greatest adaptions from a novel. One of the greater strengths from the film was the overshadowing of the racist tone of the blacks in the book. Both film and book have painted what seems to be an apparent and truthful portrait of the emerging 1860s America.Scarlett and Rhett are truly two of the best characters have created. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable have forever left their mark on these literary legends. It would be hard to imagine anyone but these people in the roles. Despite the legendary Katharine Hepburn's similarity to Scarlett and Bette Davis' uncanny ability to play spoilt belles of a similar nature ('The Cabin in the Cotton', 'Jezebel'), the heights of excellence, fierceness and determination reached by Leigh would not be able to be matched. The same could be said for either Errol Flynn or Laurence Olivier in the other role.Although they almost don't need it, 'Gone With the Wind' has one of the best supporting casts a movie will ever have. With Olivia de Havilland as Melanie, Leslie Howard as Ashley, Hattie McDaniel as Mammy and Butterfly McQueen as Prissy, they all contribute highly to making it a better story.David O. Selznick was responsible for the massive undertaking, bringing life and realism with vivid and splendid technicolour. The restored version is truly a sensation to look at. On the grand scale it was produced, it is sort of difficult to see it barely equaled in his later films of the 40s.George Cukor was to be the original director of the film, but was fired for supposedly devoting more time to Leigh and de Havilland. Despite my fondness for his works, Victor Fleming made this film eternally, and in its own day, stand out from the other period pieces and creating the unbroken legacy which has not died, unlike some of the other hits of the time.
Max Steiner's score was haunting, which gave a real flavour to the movie. Who can forget the unforgettable last strains of 'Tara's Theme'?Set decoration, costumes and the rest have an eye for detail. The beauty of it all, and its grandeur, is just stunning. This movie, I found, has just one flaw. Epic length. But it wouldn't be right without it. And I wouldn't have it any other way.Must see movie for everyone. I highly recommend it. Rating: 8/10",9,3,4,3 January 2000
Annie Hall," Torture in Pokemon more endurable than this
","Oh dear? What was this movie about anyway? How did it even to manage to win the Oscar for best picture of 1977, the year that should have been 'Star Wars'? It may have at least been openly honest, but never again will I sit through any movie which mentions the name Woody Allen in any part of the opening credits.Rating: Not listed so I don't offend Annie Hall fans",1,21,50,13 January 2000
Titanic," Did I use to like that movie?
","It was the most amazing movie two years ago, but in 2000, the flawed fiction account of the most famous ship in history seems overstatingly unbelievable. Attempting to be faithful to fact while making Leonardo look overwhelmingly good to drag girls around my target age group to the box office now makes me embarrassed to be once part of the phenomenon that once was. Unfortunately, fact could not combine with romance on that one with a director who seemed more intent of running bills into the millions of dollars to break into the record books.I will not be entirely venomous towards the movie, because it was after all, at one stage, my favourite movie. Kate Winslet's performance was perhaps the best in the whole film, but her lower key and lower profiled Oscar nominated performance in 'Sense and Sensibility' as Marianne still exceeds this one entirely. She has a knack for costume period drama in a good showy part, but she has done better work elsewhere.What once seemed to be perfection of movie making is quickly becoming evident with its misconceptions of film making. The screenplay at the time, and the musical score seemed completely breathtaking, but now merely looks the complete fluke that had enough star drawing power to get people to hand over their cash to the box office. Celine Dion assaulting the world with a maudlin ballad about a sinking ship of course increased the movie's success to a greater extent than it deserved. Perhaps the art decoration, costume design and cinematography will outlast some of the mediocre elements disguised beneath the surface of the gloss. The 'Titanic' hype lasted long enough to secure a record equaling amount of Oscars first reached in 1959 with 'Ben-Hur'. During the 1990s, the Academy seemed to be handing the best picture statuette to the wrong pictures, with the exception of 'Schlindler's List' and 'The Silence of the Lambs'. Without a doubt, it will retain its place in history as a movie epic for all the generations. But it is certainly no 'Gone With the Wind' or 'Casablanca', and in sixty years we'll be wondering what we were thinking.

It's a Wonderful Life," Memories are made of this!
","Jimmy Stewart was not George Bailey. It was one of the reasons audiences of the time did not welcome back with open arms one of the stars of pre World War two. Although George Bailey was the almost perfected emotional core of every man and woman's heart, Frank Capra delivered the darkest yet of three movies featuring one of his best stars. It ruined his somewhat wholesome, small town man in the heart image that Capra had given his characters in their previous collaborations 'You Can't Take it With You' and 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington'. Angel, second class, is forever associated with 'It's a Wonderful Life'. A brilliantly silly Henry Travers as Clarence the illusive protector of a shattered man created an immortal legend. Donna Reed as Mary in her first notable role delivers on her promises, but outclassed by the deliverance of two of the most difficult roles in cinema history. Capra faves, Thomas Mitchell, as Uncle Billy and Lionel Barrymore, in a role a far cry from lovable Grandpa Vanderhoff in 'You Can't Take it With You', is convincingly sinister as Mr Potter. In its imagery, 'It's a Wonderful Life' is frightening. Dark, grim, terrifying moments exceed the Capra trademarks. The comedic moments thrill, and there are plenty of them. Three viewings, the first not at Christmas, have imprinted the memory of unforgettable sequences into my mind forever.
Few films were ever designed with a message to remain immortalised through the years. It remains simple and complex on certain levels however it is viewed, but the most important two are all there in the script. 'No man is a failure who has friends', and 'Life is wonderful'. The film must be watched until on some personal level, the viewer connects with what the film is trying to say. The movie is the stock treatment I prescribe to others in times of depression. A decent dosage could bring a more positive outlook of optimism to even the most cynical prepared to look beyond the black and white images. There has never been a more capable Hollywood movie made to create tears and laughters in excessive amounts which makes it a masterpiece of the American cinema, and the definitive Holiday classic. It remains the most influential of movies I have seen in my life. I was originally one of those cynical with a refusal to view any movie made in black and white. With little effort, it changed my perspective on life, but however easily I have forgotten the lessons this film teaches, it just as simply reminds me of what I need to know. It holds the record for the number of times a movie has made me cry. 'It's a Wonderful Life' was a Christmas ritual I was never dragged through when I was younger. I wish I was.

To Kill a Mockingbird," One of the best films of the 1960s
","The film explored could only be possibly left undisturbed in all its proud, grim glory, in black and white cinematography, rather than using inferior colour processes. The 60s remains the peak of time in which the moral certainty and controversially challenging racial themes were most strongly implied, although the classic story of innocence and a black man charged with the rape of a white girl is still alarmingly relevant today, even to a lesser extent.Could To Kill a Mockingbird be able to survive a modern day movie re-make, miniseries or television film?Remaking Mockingbird as a feature film in a sense would almost be as bad as a sequel to Casablanca or a remake of Gone With the Wind. It is to morals as what Citizen Kane is to its own powerful themes and what Singin in the Rain or The Wizard of Oz is to musicals. In other words, any sign of a duplicate could do no justice to its predecessor, without undoing the originals power, which had first debuted on the screen in celebrated style almost forty years ago.Unfortunately, incidence had to be compromised with cinematic length, and some of the novels key events were not filmed. I saw Mockingbird some months before I studied the novel, which happens to be the text currently being studied at school, and despite its excellence, it has not been entirely helpful. The question remains as to whether even some of the film s darkest themes were deemed unfilmable. Apart from that, the screenplay of Horton Foote remains largely faithful, and retains most of the literary brilliance of Harper Lees original Pulitzer Prize winning work. In turn, the director has done the same.No actor of the day could have played Atticus Finch better than the great man, Gregory Peck himself. Any sign of the comic, cynical newspaper reporter he played previously in Roman Holiday is far removed. The dignified symbolism of human idealism was a well-deserved Oscar win, played to the upper core of conviction.The usage of literal unknown actors, including Mary Badham as Scout, has therefore not compromised some of the all-important supporting creations by bastardising the film with big names. Finally, Kim Stanleys narration of the older Scout is fitting and appropriately convincing.Technical elements for this 60s film are generally above average. Visibly rugged sets and costumes have been well created. The musical score is not an intrusion, but rather a befitting haunting melody that becomes increasingly better with each viewing of the film. Its a relief to know a lousy, irrelevant theme song does not accompany the film.Against Lawrence of Arabia, David Leans masterpiece epic, the fact that the underdog Mockingbird won any Oscars at all is truly a wonder. Named by the AFI as one of the top 100 films of all time in 1998 only further proves why this film has been one of the most successful adaptations and perhaps the best film of any year in the 1960s. Unfortunately, 1962 was simply not one of them.Rating: 8.5/10",8,0,1,2 April 2000
Rear Window," Hitchcock masterpiece
","There's something so terrible and tragic about Jeff Jeffries, Jimmy Stewart's character. Confined to a wheelchair at home with his leg in a cast, the photographer seems to be incredibly lonely, a photographer who seems to have lost some of his humane instincts by not allowing mostly decent people to have their privacy. We see through his eyes what he believes to be a murder, but what we don't see is all the rest of what happened as his suspicions all come exclusively from his point of view.
This was one of the best Hitchcock films ever made, and is second only to 'North by Northwest'. The Hitch managed to assemble top talent for his movies, beginning with 'Rope' for Jimmy. 'Rear Window' was Jimmy's personal favourite of the Hitchcock movies. Grace Kelly, as Lisa Freemont, the rich, beautiful girlfriend does not have the most essential part but her presence does manage to unearth Jeff's solitude. Notable performances from the supporting cast include Thelma Ritter, as Stella the maid and Raymond Burr, as Lars, suspected murderer. Certainly the movie has in tow all the great elements on its side. The best of scripts, the best of talent from the acting stable and a mastermind director of suspense. Another of the more interesting elements is the musical score, which is provided courtesy of the songwriting man as he attempts to unleash his musical masterpiece.Does this provide an excuse for prying into the lives of other people, by unearthing the curious inner person of us all? I hardly think so, but it brings a very real insight to the lives of others, particularly shown through the character of Miss Lonely Hearts, that there are a lot of lonely people out there. It also shows that our neighbours can be doing a lot of interesting things if we are watching at the right moment.
After the whole murder business which pulled Jeff further and further into the mystery to the point of no escape, I think I will stop spying on my brother and his girlfriend. It after all, was my new year's resolution before I turn fifteen. But just by writing the words to this review makes me want to watch the movie again. Hitchcock created an intriguing treat which cannot be spoiled by repeated viewings of his 50s thriller classic. Rating: 10/10",10,2,5,19 January 2000
Gladiator," One of the year's highlights?
","Any movie not plugged for mass hysteria and advancements of special effects that seem to occur with every movie released promising unique and original experiences is literally a must-see. Although the film currently co-incides with the release of 'Mission Impossible 2', this is definitely the more intelligible and less senseless of the two. 'Gladiator' proves that an epic can be good, produced on a massive scale and not run over three hours. Sometimes two and a half hours however, is still not enough to finish a large popcorn and drink.One of the most noticeable elements of the film is its breathtaking cinematography, much of it possible by the special effects and beautiful European locations, not reliant on exploding helicopters, let alone the flaming city of the Rome. Spectacular battle sequences, a glimpse into an interpretation of the afterlife and even the employment of the simple slow motion technique provide handsome treats for the eyes.
Russell Crowe is the general turned slave, turned gladiator, turned risen hero, turned Hollywood star. His rugged, reluctant performance is naturally the centrepiece of the movie, although almost the entire cast turns in good performances, enhanced by an above average screenplay.
The only disappointing performance is from Joaquain Phoenix, whose pompous Commodus evokes a road company Peter Ustinov as Emperor Nero from 'Quo Vadis', only no one will be handing any Academy Award nominations or nods of any sort to him. In terms of the possible bouquets handed out to 'Gladiator', come February 2001, it looks like the film will be receiving a whole lot of them.   'Gladiator' evokes the classic epics of the Golden Era, 'Ben-Hur', 'Spartacus' and the definitive biblical epic, 'Quo Vadis.' Although the latter was filmed under more strained, theatrical-like conditions now almost fifty years ago, 'Gladiator' is reminiscent of the film, albeit a more attractive looking one. Its plot line even seems to be similar, Ancient Rome, corrupt authorities, handsome hero falling for the forbidden fruit...a woman, even if Crowe's has a sense of partial fidelity amid faith and personal devastation. The success of 'Gladiator' has been enjoyed, primarily because the current generation has yet to see such a grand, lavish epic. Since I am fifteen, I can truthfully state this is the only large scale, true historical epic I have ever seen, made in the current day. Since there's enough historical accuracy, heroes, special effects and gory battle violent sequences, which insures box office and something for everyone, there's enough in this film to convince me that, for now, Hollywood may be capable once again of occasionally making films like they used to.

The Wizard of Oz," I'm over the rainbow...
","All things aside, this is still one of the greatest movies ever made. The story is one of the most treasured and well known in the world, its morals are true, its idealisms simple but realistic. And everything combined, undisputed it is one of the immortal classics of 1939, one of the golden years of Hollywood, which is only rivaled by 1941.'Oz' is all a fantasy, but a good one at that. Simple story telling, yes incredibly clever, but makes some of the most effective entertainment ever. Some of my high school friends still remained crushed at the fact that after attempting to imitate Judy Garland singing 'Over the Rainbow' they did not find themselves in Oz.I admit it, I only first saw the movie when I was twelve. So I missed out on the terrible losses of being afraid of the Wicked Witch of the West at age five. By the time I was thirteen and completely off what I perceived as the sugary, forgotten movies which lacked realism and failed to address proper issues, I disliked anything that was made before the 1990s. After 'The Sound of Music', the movie which I previously loathed above any other, I began to rediscover some of the cinematic treasures.And this is one of them. 'Oz' was Dorothy's utopia. Her world literally had been whipped up in that cyclone with Miss Gulch on her heels. Most of us have our own 'Oz', a place we think that is better as our own, but further in, are we supposed to discover that there simply is 'No place like home?'This movie introduced many a new thing to the world. It proved that the public like fantasies. For one, I discovered exactly why everyone rambled on about munchkins or uttered other phrases such as 'Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore' or 'We're off to see the Wizard'.Bert Lahr unfortunately found it difficult getting other castings afterwards other than lions, and it established Judy as one of the forces in history, this performance alone. For in her peak performance, none of her others can be equaled. Watching her as the lost, disheartened, naive Dorothy singing 'Over the Rainbow' is heartbreaking. Just that one rendition has conjured up self images of beheading Shirley Temple if she played Dorothy, and only because of the picture's massive budget. Yes, Judy's voice seems too big for Dorothy, but it could not be right any other way.'The Wizard of Oz' is a cinematic blessing, a stroke of pure genius. It has everything it needs on its side, with the partial exception of early editing annoyances, but is otherwise an almost flawless conception. The score itself is an immortalised masterpiece. 'The Sound of Music' remains my musical favourite, but 'Oz' gets a look in there in the top 5. Even 'Singin' in the Rain' cannot surpass this one.My only complaint of the musical is that MGM released it in the year on which they were focusing more on 'Gone With the Wind'. The public reaction was so strong for 'Gone With the Wind' receiving the Best Picture statuette that year it would have been impossible for anything else to take the top prize. In 1940, 'Oz' would have been a pure breadwinner.The film survives in an era where we are searching harder for 'quality' entertainment. There's no need to look beyond your back yard for this one. It's in the video collection. Or should be.Rating: 9/10",9,2,4,20 January 2000
