The Incredible Hulk," Possibly the best Superhero movie yet...
","The Incredible Hulk is definitely the movie that stays truest to the comic book, while still paying homage to the television series. Edward Norton does well as always as Bruce Banner and Tim Roth does especially well as the overly-masculine, power-hungry mercenary that becomes The Abomination. The movie does not make the mistake of trying to tackle too much, keeps the love interest (in my thoughts the weakest point) in the background, and boasts the best action scenes in any superhero movie, ending with the spectacular brawl between The Hulk and The Abomination. This movie has everything, and it mixes it together well for the most polished superhero movie ever.",7,4,10,13 June 2008
