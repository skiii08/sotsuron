Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A More than worthy addition to the Star Wars saga!
","**** I loved this movie. I can't express how good a movie it was. I am used to my generations average action movie which is good guys blow up all with no story, 1000 curses sex and the chopping off of someones head along the way. This movie is Star Wars. The same magic as was in 1977. It has a great story, fantastic charcters and unbelievably real and jaw dropping special effects. Everything is great. I especially love the connections. I love how Palpatine calls Anakin 'YOUNG SKYWALKER' and Qui-Gon discusses point of views with young Obi Wan. A subject Obi Wan will teach Luke later. It's just a great movie see it enjoy it and smile as I did as the lights dimmered and the famous words A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away brought me back to a wonderful place.",10,0,0,2 July 1999
