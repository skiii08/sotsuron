Mission: Impossible III," This message will self-destruct in five seconds! OK I'm lying.
","I saw Mission Impossible III today and it was a good movie, but it had its fair share of problems.THE GOOD: Mission Impossible III stars of course Tom Cruise, and Co-Stars Ving Rhames. The movie is pretty cool and has some great action sequences, but that's pretty much it.THE BAD: This is what if been waiting for. First of all, I have been thinking about one thing since I left the theater. The Acting! It's so bad. The dialogue sucks. Most of the lines between Ethan and his girl friend are so corny, you want to laugh. Second, the script is awful. It felt like a TV movie script more than a major motion picture script. Finally, the movie seemed to have been made to make Cruise look good since the Brooke Shields incident, rather than a Mission Impossible sequel. Also the guy that directed it had never done movies before and it was hard to live up to what Brian De Palma and John Woo did.FINAL WORD: The movie is worth a matin√©e and should probable be seen on the big screen. It's not as good as the first two, but makes a worthy sequel.B-",7,0,1,6 May 2006
