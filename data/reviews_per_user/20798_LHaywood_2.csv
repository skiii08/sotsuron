First Man," Emerging from the post 9/11 fog of America Heroism
",First Man is a film that finally moves away from hero rhetoric and American self-worship that has been a common preoccupation in films that have followed the Bush era master narrative since 9/11. A portrait of a thoroughly 'human' man and an outstanding film.,10,5,18,13 October 2018
Joker," Metaphor for the decline and violence of Western Democracies
","I wasn't prepared for this movie to make such a bold political statement. The Joker/ Arthur is a metaphor for the illness of western society and the failure of western democracy to care for its citizens.
The real Joke is we do not vote for leaders who care for citizens but try to live vicariously through images in media.
The film even has a go at the illusion in the happiness trap. Mans pursuit of happiness leaves In His wake another persons misery.
I guess the message is that the violent society is the one that allows obscene wealth to live alongside abject poverty.",10,1,2,17 October 2019
