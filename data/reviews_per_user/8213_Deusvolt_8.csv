Spartacus," Based on a historical slave revolt in areas controlled by Republican Rome, it is a story of both tragedy and triumph.
","If you saw the movie, read the book (by Howard Fast) and if you have read the book, see the movie and see that they fit seamlessly together without major deviations.The most memorable scenes are of course those of the final battle with the eerie and chilling sound of the clink, clink, clink of armor as the Roman infantry marches into intricate battle positions. I believe soldiers of the Spanish army were used as extras for this movie.The most memorable line is that of Crassus (Olivier) as he impresses upon Antoninus, the slave (Tony Curtis), the strength of the Roman Republic. He gazes at a cohort of soldiers with their massive pilae (spears or spikes)and their bronze shields marching pass his villa at night. 'There Antoninus, goes the might and power of Rome. Nothing can withstand it...........how much more a mere boy?' And at that point Antoninus, whom he had been trying to seduce into a homosexual tryst with oblique erotic talk referring to 'snails and oysters,' escaped to join the rebelling army of slaves led by Spartacus.Made just as the various civil rights organizations were starting to cohere, one wonders if this epic movie which highlighted the injustice of slavery, had an impact on American society which finally acknowledged and did something about its gross violations of human rights based on skin color.",10,21,33,11 October 2005
A Bridge Too Far," A faithful rendition of a disastrous Allied military operation in Holland in WWII..
","I appreciated the stellar cast but it did have a disadvantage : the many actors did not have the opportunity to display their thespian abilities. But it was just as well as too much acting would have detracted from the more interesting historical details which really account for the strength of the film.Wolfgang Preiss who portrayed Field Marshall Gen. Von Runstedt was the most effective actor in the movie. He conveyed the persona of a confident, practical and honest military commander and not without a keen sense of humor. Maximillian Schell also did well as the compassionate Lt. Gen. Bittrich, surprising considering that he was an SS Panzer man. Hardy Kruger as Maj. Gen. Ludwig seemed morose but that was hardly his fault as he had few speaking parts. I don't know what it is about his face but he doesn't strike me as German. He looks more like an American baseball player. By the way, for those who are confused why Maj. Gen. Ludwig (Hardy Kruger)took orders from Lt. Gen. Bittrich (Maximillian Schell), it must be explained that within the rank of generals, a lieutenant outranks a major. Gene Hackman was terrible with that unlikely Polish accent. Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford and Eliot Gould were so-so, ho-hum. Dirk Bogarde as a British martinet and 'Col. Blimp' was a lot of fun but the role did not really fit his handsome looks. We must thank Sir Laurence Olivier for deigning to take the role of what could only be called an 'extra.' But I suppose most of the big name actors who signed on to this movie did so because they appreciated its historical value and they knew that it would remain an important movie for all time.I must complain about the puny armored vehicles used by the Panzer unit commanded by Lt. Gen. Bittrich : No authentic looking Tiger and the later model Panther tanks. What I liked most was the musical theme composed and conducted by John Addison who was a veteran of Market Garden having been a soldier with the XXX Corps (British) under Gen. Horrocks. We don't even know if it has a title or is it simply just the 'A Bridge Too Far Theme.'",7,0,1,28 December 2004
Gran Torino," Hard Moral Questions Answered
","Gee,thanks Clint! After these endless exposes of crimes by sex maniacs among Catholic clergy and their lazy bishop enablers who moved them from parish to parish because they are loath to lose 'workers' or simply out of 'old boy' sympathies, it is a relief to see a film sympathetic to Catholics, even as we laymen are equally to blame for being equally lazy blind sheep.It is also refreshing to have Polish Americans depicted as good Catholics instead of the usual Fr. O'Malley (Bing Crosby) Irish types.It is hard to classify this film as that would be pigeon-holing it as a tragedy, a paean to heroism and therefore a triumph, or simply a good comedy. There are elements of all these. Eastwood made a courageous choice to pay no heed to political correctness as ethnic jokes came fast and funny in the film. The hard ribbing about some American perceptions of Asian diets were hilarious. Sample: Eastwood declining an Asian girl's invitation to a banquet: 'No thanks and keep your hands off my dog.' 'We only eat cats,' the girl retorted. In fairness, almost everybody gets hit - even white folks especially 'Micks' and 'Pollacks.' Blacks get it too although unspoken and almost subliminally as gangbang rap music is associated with street hoodlums.Most important, the main character, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is portrayed as a good Catholic although not what most people would picture in their minds: the rosary clutching, daily mass going, ascetic who goes about hands pressed together in perpetual pious devotion. Not that there is anything wrong with that but it's fun to see a crusty, beer-swilling, cussing contrary old man turn out to be a good person.Now for the hard moral questions: Kowalski goes to confession. He doesn't confess the fact that he beat up a Hmong toughie a few days earlier. Obviously, he didn't think that was a sin because he did it to stop the punk's gang from continuously hunting down Thao, the Hmong youth trying to straighten out his life. Educated armchair moralists may say 'the end does not justify the means' but remember, Kowalski is just a retired auto line worker and part-time repairman. Still another seeming lapse of conscience: As he tried to dissuade Thao from embarking on mindless vengeance, he intimated that in the Korean War, he shot a young boy (soldier) who was probably scared and just trying to surrender. He didn't include that in his confession. No problem. His perception of that wartime incident is a recollection quite probably colored by post traumatic stress disorder, old age and failing health. In the heat of battle, he was just shooting at enemy soldiers as he was force-trained automatically to do. Kowalski must have known that was the case. That's why he saw no need to confess it. I believe Christ Himself would have directly told him 'Ego te absolvo...' Here's the spoiler: John 15:13. That's exactly how the movie ended.",8,1,5,31 January 2009
Departures," A special niche in the funeral professions
","This film revealed to me what I consider to be a very special niche in the funeral professions. I've long known of embalmers, funeral cosmetologists, hearsemen and funeral masters of ceremonies. But this is the first time, I have encountered 'encoffiners' who perform the ritual of enconffinment.I was impressed by the precision and grace of the encoffiners portrayed in the film. They way the cleaned the bodies, their putting on and removal of blankets, shrouds and clothes without exposing any part of the deceased bodies other than their faces, hands and feet showed deep respect. Why do they take such trouble when the body is destined for cremation anyway? Why all the washing, dressing, shaving and make-up? Obviously, they believe in an after life for, after all, they kept using the phrase 'sending off' in reference to what they do.Their measured and reverent movements evoked in me memories of a Tridentine mass performed by a truly devout priest.I realize that there are those who find this film boring, weird or allegedly inappropriately acted. As someone who worked closely with Japanese and traveled extensively in Japan, I hope to enlighten them on some aspects of Japanese culture through my anecdotes.On a visit to the ancient city of Kyoto, my boss proudly announced that he was taking me to a 'cha-no-yu,' a tea ceremony. I wondered what the big deal was because at the time I would rather be attending a Chinese lauriat or even better, go to a karaoke bar in Tokyo's Ginza. Nevertheless, I was deeply moved by the ceremony. First, I was struck by the respect shown to me by the lady who performed the ceremony who practically kowtowed to me. Her actions in the preparation, serving and drinking of the tea reminded me of the mass, the transubstantiation of the wine into the blood of the Savior and communion.In two dinner visits to the houses of a Japanese executive and of a newsman, I found their hospitality rather formal but very satisfying as well. In both visits a female sat beside me to serve me. In the first instance, she was the matron of the house. In the second, it was a daughter. They way they presented and served food was almost ritualistic. In both cases, the ladies peeled oranges for me and the delightful surprise was not the taste of the oranges but they way they peeled them so that the peelings when laid on the table looked like flowers.One night in Kumamoto while I was sleeping, I was awakened by the lady of the house who told me that it was snowing and invited me to come out and watch with her. She led me to the living room where there was a large glass picture window. As we sat on our haunches on the floor and watched the snow cover the lawn and the trees, I realized that she considered that a treat and to me, it was.",7,1,3,19 March 2013
The Godfather: Part III," It's worth seeing if only for the performance of Raf Vallone.
","Al Pacino is, well....Al Pacino. He delivers his usual exemplary performance in this one. George Hamilton, despite the fact that he is often savaged by critics as an ageing pretty boy, is quite credible in this film as the urbane topnotch corporate lawyer helping Michael get out of the bloody Mafia business by acquiring legitimate and respectable holdings.But the real gem in the movie is the Italian actor, Raf Vallone. Often cast as a 'heavy,' a Mafia enforcer in countless gangster movies such as in the original Italian Job (with Michael Caine), it is refreshing to see him cast in a sympathetic role. As the Catholic Bishop of the diocese covering Sicily, he becomes father confessor to Don Michael Corleone and offers him saintly advice. His character is based loosely on the short-reigned John Paul I (Albini), a theologian, philosopher, essayist and poet of high caliber. I will never forget his observation on why the corrupt Mafia culture persists in Sicily. He pointed out the stones in a stream/fountain in his courtyard. Then seizing one, he smashes it open to reveal that its core is dry. These people (the Mafia), he says, are like the stones immersed in water for centuries. They have been Christians for hundreds of years but they have never absorbed the true essence of the faith. I liked III better than II which I found ponderous and filled with sympathetic yet corny details especially on how Corleone Sr. rose from petty mulcter to a leading Mafia Don. He was just evil, period.",7,0,1,10 October 2004
Ben-Hur," A favorite plot of storytellers - the change of fortunes of a young man of noble lineage who, by the hand of God, regains and even surpasses his former status.
","Although the chariot race was probably intended by the screenwriters to be the action climax of the film, the scene that has turned out to be the most remembered is the sea battle scene. Caricatured and lampooned in comic strips, TV skits and popular word-of-mouth jokes, it has achieved an immortality that somehow surpasses the film itself.Here's one.The 'hortator' who beats a drum setting the rowing pace on a Roman galley ship:'Good news boys, the captain has ordered extra rations of bread and wine and a day's shore leave for everybody.''The bad news - the captain wants to go water skiing tomorrow.'SPOILER: When I got hold of a video version of the film several years ago, I kept replaying that battle scene. As a kid, I marveled at the naval tactics of the Roman general played by Jack Hawkins who exuded an ambivalent mixture of genteel urbanity and a cavalier disregard for human life and suffering. The commands 'Battle speed!' 'Attack speed!' 'Ramming speed!' always sent my pulse racing.The sound effects and background music are also great considering that this was well before the time of Dolby and THX. The rousing music 'The March of the Charioteers.' It's the same music played during the Roman General's triumphal entry into Rome. It can be ranked as one of the most stirring marches of all time and was included in a Reader's Digest vinyl record collection.Antiquarians and history buffs surely appreciated the detailed costumes and armor of the Roman officers, the architecture of the famed Fortress Antonia of the Roman garrison in Palestine, the signet rings used to certify legal documents, the brazen fish at the stadium used to mark the end of each lap in the chariot race. Trivia: Most people wrongly assume that the race was held at the Circus Maximus in Rome with the Emperor Augustus presiding. Not so, that city must be Caesarea Philippi, a city near Jerusalem built by Herod the Great for the Romans to accommodate their temples and baths which were not allowed in Jerusalem as Jewish law and moral sensibilities forbade them. The Romans did bend over backwards to accommodate the Jews' insistence on religious autonomy because the latter were such implacable rebels. The person who was supposed to be presiding at the chariot race is Pontius Pilate played by Frank Thring. It was not right to costume him in royal looking robes. Pilate was a military governor. He would have been in soldier's uniform or armor or, as this was a non-military event, he would have donned the white robe with red borders of the senatorial class of which he must have been a member. Many classical paintings of Christ's passion do show him in such costume.",9,1,3,5 April 2005
Kagemusha," A common thief becomes the daimyo of a major clan vying for supremacy in feudal era Japan.
","I prefer Kagemusha over Ran because the former is semi-historical while Ran is well, just another story, never mind even if it is from Shakespeare. True there are more battle scenes in Ran and they are truly massive and moving. But I was impressed by the characterization of the thief turned warlord in Kagemusha. The dream or more appropriately nightmare sequences are evocative of Dali paintings.By the way, I visited that castle in Kumamoto where Kurosawa often filmed his samurai movies. It has been turned into a museum with great displays of armor, weapons and costumes from Japan's feudal age. Inside I came upon what looked like steps to the donjon (a tower serving as castle keep used as the final shelter defense during a siege) of the castle which seemed impossible to climb for a normal person. The steps are too high and steep and I could only imagine a leaping ninja scaling them.Visitors are not allowed to climb those 'stairs' and they have to go by another way. The displays include table dioramas of battles and sieges that took place centuries ago in the castle environs and they show the disposition of the troops of the contending forces. I visited the castle in winter and the castle and its grounds looked magnificent in the snow. The film in my camera froze and when it thawed in my overheated quarters, it caught moisture. As it was weeks before I returned to my country, it had grown mold and could not be processed. I would do anything to return to that castle.",Null,0,0,12 July 2006
V for Vendetta," A hero/anti-hero is out to avenge himself and society against a criminal government.
","I see in V influences of Zorro (the bladed weapons and the costume), Phantom of the Opera (the disfigured face and the mask), Captain America and his nemesis the Red Skull (both products of genetic engineering gone awry), Robin Hood (who robs the villains), The Silent Knight (who, however, unlike V, wasn't loquacious), the comic version of Spiderman (more because of the verbosity than the agility), Alan Ladd's The Black Knight (his chaste devotion to a lady love), Cyrano d'Bergerac (use of the rapier and the look of that Guy Fawkes mask), the beast in the TV series Beauty and the Beast (the elegant prose), and a host of other characters whether masked, disfigured or not.The storyline is of course similar to those of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. The wonderful difference is that unlike in 1984 where the hero physically survives but loses his freedom of mind, in V for Vendetta, (spoiler ahead), V vicariously survives his death through the many people who take up his challenge to set themselves free by virtually assuming his identity. In Fahrenheit 451, the heroes are really the books which survive through people with the main character taking the identity of a particular book by memorizing it. In V's case, he becomes an idea that survives in the hearts and minds of people. For further comparisons, watch Brazil, another Fahrenheit take-off, which in spite of its inspiring visual effects is quite a 'downer.'The above having been said, there is no quibbling over the fact that it is a riveting movie. The speeches, repartee and even the obiter dicta which continuously spew from the main character are certainly worth listening to and remembering. I was struck by that quote in Latin on his antique mirror (Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici)which comes from Christopher Marlowe's play The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus based on a German folk tale. Production value is great. The topic is both current and everlasting : how people in general respond to cleverly manipulative, brutal and tyrannical governments -- initially with timid obeisance until inspired by a few or even one brave person.This writer should know as he participated in the glorious People Power Revolution of the Philippines, a country under the grip of a rightist and criminal dictatorship for 14 years. Until, one person told us that we couldn't 'allow ourselves to be paralyzed by fear' and that 'courage is contagious' made us march in the millions with nothing but flowers and rosaries to topple the Dictatorship. What intrigues me was V's use of the Guy Fawkes mask and why he derives his inspiration for his revolt from the Gunpowder Plot. Was he a Catholic? Are his creators (Alan Moore and David Lloyd)? The Gunpowder Plotters were disenfranchised Catholics who couldn't bear the repression of their right to worship in the Old Faith. Their churches were confiscated by the monarch and given over to the Church of England while parliament passed laws stripping English Catholics of much of their rights, excluding them from much of public employment and restricting their ownership of property.The film of course takes deep digs at the proponents of 'The War on Terror' who use the problem of terrorism to promote their rightist agenda and for their and their friends' power and economic aggrandizement.",8,3,6,19 March 2006
