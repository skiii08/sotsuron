The Hangover," Am I missing something?
","I am a little surprised that this movie has averaged such high reviews. It seems to be universally well reviewed on the web and many people I know that have seen it have highly recommended it. This may be the main reason why I was so disappointed, but overall I thought it was quite an average road-trip-gone-wrong type of movie and would have rated it as I have regardless. I certainly didn't experience the laugh-a-minute entertainment that others have mentioned. A faint chuckle here and there, but that's about it.Now I don't mind the odd far-fetched 'silly' movie so I'm not a prude when it comes to this type of genre. The premise of the movie had potential, but the execution just didn't quite cut it for me. For starters, the acting was mediocre. 'That was bad acting' came to mind in several scenes. Some of the situations were a little over-the-top, juvenile, and lacking in comedy. The cops with the tasers is just one of many examples. If you're into 'kicked in the nuts' kind of humor, then you may find this really funny, but only barely made me grin.Not the worst comedy I've seen and overall wasn't a totally unenjoyable experience, but certainly (for me) not worthy of the hype it is receiving.",6,3,7,23 December 2009
Terminator Salvation," Does nothing for the Terminator franchise storyline.
","I will do this in point form; <ul><li>In short, not a great movie, but if you're into action with little supporting plot, then you will probably like this.</li></ul><ul><li>The main disappointment with TS is that there was a lot of potential and a lot of the work had already been done in the previous movies. Unfortunately this movie flushes most of this potential down the drain.</li></ul><ul><li>This movie is better than T3, (not hard), but nowhere near as good as T1 and T2.</li></ul><ul><li>Lots of action and chase scenes. But without a strong supporting story, they just seem superfluous.</li></ul><ul><li>The main thing that stuck out for me in this movie was how ineffective skynet was despite it's awesome technological advantage. E.g. Skynet captured Kyle Reese, but for some reason didn't kill him despite him being #1 on the Skynet hit-list. Why? Same with John Conner. All a terminator has to do is crush his throat, or break his neck, crush his skull, etc. However, it looks like terminators are programmed to toss their victims around like a cat playing with a half-dead mouse. Another example is at the petrol station where a monstrous robot seems quite inefficient at killing a few humans getting away in rusted old cars. And then it has a real hard time stopping Marcus getting away in a tow-truck where it suddenly loses it's ability to aim. This lack of logic for the sake of drawing out action scenes just ruins a movie for me.</li></ul><ul><li>There seems to be many inconsistencies with weapon damage and terminator robustness. In some cases a grenade launcher will just blow off some skin, but next time around has the ability to blow a terminator several meters backwards through the air.</li></ul><ul><li>What is the point of this movie anyway? The main point seems to be to save Kyle Reese. But it would have been better if the movie ended with John sending Kyle back in time so that at least it gave you a sense of purpose or closing a loop in the story. Instead, the movie is centered around saving Kyle (which Skynet had many opportunities to kill anyway) and then they blow up some part of Skynet.... and that's it. Ummmm, OK, and...? How did this movie add to the Terminator story or answer questions? In fact a Terminator 5 movie could be made by virtually totally ignoring this movie altogether.</li></ul><ul><li>Why would John Conner let Marcus go knowing he is Skynet built? Marcus knows the location of his base. Surely a real-life John would realize that Marcus was built for infiltration. In this respect John just pulls down his pants, bends over the table and says 'come and give it to me Skynet'. The same goes with the female pilot, Bloodgood. She knows Marcus for two days, and when she finds out he is a cyborg, decides to rescue him because she believes 'he's human'. Never mind the fact he is a cyborg with computer chips in his head, he seems like a nice guy. With this type of thinking it's amazing there is any resistance left. Absolutely illogical.</li></ul><ul><li>In T3, Arnie's terminator says that he kills him, but is reprogrammed and sent back to protect him. But in this movie this same apparent terminator is blown up in the nuclear explosion.</li></ul><ul><li>Another illogical thing is the terminator motorbikes. John is able to capture one, reprogram it and then ride off on it like a normal motorbike assuming that for some illogical reason the bike has a seat, pedals, and controls that would allow a human to ride it.</li></ul><ul><li>Time travel is not mentioned or hinted at in any way that I recall. I may be being picky, but just another example of how the movie doesn't address any of the storyline in the previous movies.</li></ul><ul><li>Security at Skynet at the end seems very lax. OK we see Marcus disable one or two security measures, but overall, infiltrating Skynet seems like a walk in the park.</li></ul><ul><li>John is mentioned to be considered as a prophet by some, but there is no explanation or story related to how John obtained this status. He is simply introduced in the opening text as such.</li></ul><ul><li>There seems to be many dead-ends in the movie. E.g. What's with Kyle's mute side-kick? Seemed like a pointless character. The old woman in the petrol station also seems to be a character who is introduced who goes nowhere. There is no explanation as to why skynet is taking prisoners. I assume as workers, but I don't recall this being explained. The love interest between Bloodgood and Marcus also seems to be pointless, other than her illogically rescuing him. What was her intention? To run off to Las Vegas and get married to him? </li></ul>Overall a very, very, thin storyline and doesn't do much for the Terminator franchise. I can only rate it for it's pure action entertainment value.If you want your brain to take a rest and be entertained by eye candy and explosions, then you just many like this movie. If you're a real terminator fan I believe you will be very disappointed at the lack of storyline.",5,2,4,1 January 2010
The Thing," Remains to be one of my favorite horrors
","I have probably added +1 to my rating of this movie due to nostalgic reasons. I watched this movie when I was young and I loved it and remains to be one of my favorite horror movies. However, this is probably more an indictment on the horror genre in general, as it seems that not many great horror movies are made now-a-days.I love the setting and atmosphere of the movie as well as the storyline. Stuck in Antartica on a base with a handful of men and a deadly morphing alien that takes over your body which was dug out of the ice.Considering the age of the movie, the effects are OK. I can get past them...even the 'spider head', which was quite horrifying to a 10 year old boy.Another thing I like about this movie was the absence of any pointless love affair. In fact the movie lacked females altogether, which seems to be quite rare in today's movies. In all honesty, I felt this added to the atmosphere of the movie.There are a few minor dumb dialog and plot decisions, but does not detract from the movie for me. One thing I found a little silly, was the ending with the alien managing to almost build a spaceship out of spare parts. Ummm.... A little illogical and far fetched, but I will forgive it.Overall if you like a good horror and have overlooked John Carpenter's The Thing, then it is very much worth your while to give it a look.",9,4,7,3 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Bad mix of comedy and cheap 'horror'
","While watching this drivel I was confused as to whether the intention was for it to be a horror or a comedy. (It did in fact remind me of Evil Dead even before I found out it had the same writers.) Trying to mix horror with comedy is like mixing oil and water. They don't mix well and are not complementary.This is one of those annoying 'horrors' that employs cheap scare tactics by forcing you to turn the volume up loud so as to hear the dialog, and then have something jump at you at full scramble-for-the-remote volume. This may have been entertaining when I was 12, but now only gets on my nerves.The séance scene was so laughable that again I was confused as to whether the main intention was to invoke fear or laughs. I believe it may have been the latter. Unfortunately I experienced neither.This movie could only be enjoyed by teenagers that may be more forgiving of the films shortcomings and its reliance on special effects for cheap entertainment. Personally I found it difficult to sit through.",3,3,8,30 December 2009
Defiance," OK Movie, but slap on wrist for 'True Story' label
","I enjoyed the movie despite some of the many clichés, particularly at the end. My biggest annoyance was the 'True Story' label at the beginning of the movie. This simply should not be allowed. This is not a true story, it is 'based on a true story' or 'inspired by true events'.The movie had a lot of clichéd moments, but the best one (worst for the movie) was the ending with the 'brother to the rescue' scene when fighting the Germans. That was just way too in-your-face Hollywood for me and made me physically cringe.I was going to rate this movie a 7, but as usually happens when I review a movie, I think about it's inadequacies and have to rate it down a point.Overall though, not a bad movie and worth watching for entertainment value, but someone should get sued for passing this off as a true story.",6,0,3,3 January 2010
