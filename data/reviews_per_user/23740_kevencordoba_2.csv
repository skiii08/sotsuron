Hereditary," Insulting to the audience
","The pros: Acting was goodThe cons: 
Incredibly slow paced just build 'tension'
It tries to be one of those mindf-k movies but just utterly fails
The audience in the theater actually laughed at various points it was so ridiculous.
So many cliche moments I lost count.
And it was just plain boring",1,121,248,19 June 2018
No Country for Old Men," Don't let the bad reviews discourage you from seeing this
","For the love of god, do not let the reviews from those who gave this a 1/10 discourage you from seeing this memorable film. They're just angry because they didn't understand the movie and think it's overrated. If anything it's underrated. I wasn't a fan of Joel and Ethan Coen before this film and even after I'm still not a huge fan. I am, however, a huge fan of the writer of the novel No Country For Old Men and this movie is very faithful to the novel and the Coen's captured the essence of the novel almost perfectly. This is a great action film with some of the most realistic shootouts I've seen in film. It's suspense and even humorous at times. Again, don't let those bad reviews decide for you that you already dislike this movie. The story this movie and book tells is worth it.",9,19,26,27 May 2017
