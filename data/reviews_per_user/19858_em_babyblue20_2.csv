Changeling," extraordinary movie. excellent story, director, outstanding performance by Angelina Jolie
","This movie surprised me in an extremely good way. I don't know what was the Academy thinking... This movie should have won not only for best actress in a leading role but for best movie too. For me, Slumdog millionaire and even The curios case of Benjamin Button were not as good as this one. Very good drama. Very touching also. Go and see it, you will not be sorry. Angelina Jolie is great in her performance as the whole cast is. Is the kind of movie that gives you a lesson, that teaches you in a way how unpredictable life can be. Extraordinary. I would see this a second, a third and maybe a fourth time in a month! 10 out of 10.",10,5,7,10 March 2009
Troy," my favorite one. a masterpiece
","Troy was and remains my favorite movie ever. The first time I watched Troy I was stunned. I didn't think that movie would change forever my top. I was truly impressed by the acting, the story, the fight scenes and most of all, the love story between Achilles and Briseis which deeply impressed me. All he wanted was glory, and this movie is a story of Achilles, the hero, the super man, the soldier that obey no one but himself, but at the end, his desire of immortality, of glory is left away by his love for the beautiful cousin of prince Hector and Prince Paris, Briseis. I loved also the battle scenes, especially the one between Achilles and Hector. I must say I think this movie is the best of Pitt's, and in my opinion, he deserved to win an Oscar for this movie. Also I liked Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole as actors in this movie. All I can say is 'Bravo' to all the actors, producers, directors...etc. If you didn't see this movie, go and see it, you will be extremely surprised.",10,11,18,30 January 2009
