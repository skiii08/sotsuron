Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Banal joke and fake documentary
","This movie is so banal that I almost want to vomit at some scenes. It started from a fake village, with a fake reporter, on a fake mission.I cannot understand why this movie is so hyped. Are those jokes funny? They are simply bizarre.By the way, I have to write 10 lines about this movie in order to submit this comment. Why 10 lines? Do we have spell 10 lines to make a point? For people who are looking for comedy, I highly recommend Little Miss Sunshine. There are some jokes and laughters there. But they are genuine and humane. Overall, Borat is an awful movie.",1,1,4,28 January 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Manufactured Emotion and an unrealistic tale
","I read comments on this IMDb, most with 10 out of 10 rating. Therefore my expectation was high, but I came out with an annoyed and disappointed feeling.The characters are very likable but the story is very weak. The love between these two main characters is idealized, in my opinion. First of all, such love cannot survive over 20 years. In the movie they are still deeply in love with each other. While such love is plausible but it is simply not real. With 50% divorce rate in this country in mind, and as someone who has been through such process, I see how love can change over time, drowned by daily mundane tasks and familiarity between two people. It is a miracle that a romantic love can survive 10 years, not to say 20 years. In the movie, the two main characters maintain their love through secretive meetings once a while. Such love may be able to survive because it contains no daily context, and no struggling through life through shared effort together.I do like the music and cinematography very much. Every shot is very powerful. However, the writing and story is so weak that a skilled director cannot save it.",7,19,64,18 December 2005
The Island," A feel-good movie that is intelligent and fun
","This movie is very gratifying and fun to watch. When I walked out the theater, I still feel this sense of well-being, happiness and feeling of beauty. What makes me feel good is not just good finally triumphed over evil, or that basic humanity is preserved, but also the youth and beauty of our main characters that resonates in my heart. I love watching McGregor and Scarlett Johansson together. What a lovely pair. When they sail on the ocean together, I feel like seeing paradise in my eyes.The story is flawlessly told, and actions are well directed. I feel connected with almost everyone in the movie, even the bad guys.It is very rare that a movie makes me feel so good after watching it. The island has achieved this, and I thank the director for giving me such a wonderful and high-quality time.",8,2,4,24 July 2005
