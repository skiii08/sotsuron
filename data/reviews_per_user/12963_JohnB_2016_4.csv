Black Swan," The Beautiful Dance into Darkness
","This film was an absolute beauty. I was deeply amazed by this movie with its acting, story line, and atmosphere. Watching Portman's character Nina drift slowly into madness for the role of Swan Queen are some of the best psychological thrills about this movie, as she battles her inner 'Black Swan', fighting to perfect the role, and prevent this new and upcoming rival Lily (Kunis) from taking it from her. Along with the somewhat violent sexual contact received from her instructor, a supposed tool he uses to help her understand the Black Swan's role, she is under constant pressure to 'let go'. This madness drives her to see her darkest nightmares and desires to become reality, right before her very eyes. Nina's hardship is made worse when her over-obsessive mother begins to attempt to keep her off the stage, believing that her (Nina's) physical self-abuse is making her sick, and unfit for the performance. But it's her strong-will to play the part that pushes Nina to the end, even if she may end up paying it with her life.This psychological thriller-horror is one that will make your skin crawl with fear and suspense. Highly recommend it.Forewarn, this movie contains repeated scenes of strong sexual content, lots of strong profanity, some violence, drug use, and a few jump scares.",10,1,3,8 September 2015
The Babadook," True Horror at it's Best
","THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING! The deep psychological horror of this movie defines the true meaning of terror. The fact that the husband dies in car wreck, and that Sam and Amelia are the only survivors, is scary enough. Amelia suffering of Oskar's death makes life hard to raise an annoying six year-old son, who is frequent in building homemade weapons and demanding attention. But it's the creature that ties this movie to its core. Mr. Babadook, a supernatural entity that haunts their quiet home, originates from a pop-up children's book Sam finds on his bookshelf. The noises this creature makes gave me chills. I mean, who would want that whispered into their ears at night, only to get possessed by the creature and have it make you try to kill your son?But what makes this movie great is the how Amelia's grief and the creature relate. Critics connect the creature's growing control of Amelia to her growing grief and stress from all pressure she gets about her husband. This leads many to think that it was Amelia that was the monster the whole time. That however, isn't the case. (Why have the book if it was the mother was the monster?) It wouldn't make sense.",10,3,6,8 September 2015
It Follows," The best Twist in Horror since 'Cabin in the Woods'
","This movie is one of the greatest twists on terror since 'Cabin in the Woods'. The fact that Jay is haunted by an unknown phenomena whose only purpose is to kill the one who carries this, disease you could call it. This 'ghost' is like something straight out of a nightmare.The characters are hard working to figure a way to end the torture that ensues those who obtain the creature, which is passed person-to-person via sexual intercourse. However, the characters tend to fight at times, but end up finding several possible solutions to their problem. But what follows is what stumped me the most. Yeah, characters die because they didn't pass it in time, but trying to electrocute the creature in a pool (WHILE YOU ARE IN IT) is probably not the best choice. By the end of the film, Jay and Paul are seen walking down the street, with 'it' following, as if they gave up trying to kill it.WHAT?! GET RID OF IT! The main thing I like about this movie is that it touches on the importance of safe sex practices, HIV/AIDS, and the horrors that can follow you forever if you don't take safety precautions first.",8,1,7,8 September 2015
Inception," An Action-filled Adventure through each Level
","This movie fails to disappoint when it comes to an amazing sci-fi action thriller. Full of action and suspense, this film not only gets your heart racing and blood pumping, but gets your brain working as well, for this movie is not enjoyable unless you understand the concept and science. Inception is the theory that an Extractor, like Cobb (DiCaprio), can input an idea into the subconscious mind of a subject at dream state. By implementing this idea, one could then control the subject throughout the dream(s) in order to manipulate him/her to reach a desired result, secret, or thought in the end, in hopes to somehow altar reality. In Cobb's case, it's the input of an idea into Fisher's (Murphy) mind in order to somehow bring down his father's multi-million dollar empire, so that Cobb can go home and see his kids again. FYI: Cobb is a wanted man for espionage and the possible involvement in Mal's death.The Architect (Page) then builds a series of levels, or dreams within a dream, in order to reach deeper into the subject's subconscious. Due to security purposes, a team member is left behind in each level to look after the others, in case projections, the people in the dream placed by the subject's subconscious, attack. This happens when the extractor rolls off the course of the dream or when the subject realizes they're in a dream.Every time you enter a new dream, time in the real world slows down in comparison to the dream world, like so:1 minute in reality is 1 hour in level 1, 1 day in level 2, 1 month in level 3, and so on and so forth.In order to return to reality, the character must somehow kill themselves. However, if one were to dive too deep into the mind, a 'kick' is required for each person in the dream to move back to the previous level.This occurs in sequence until you return to the real world, or else you fall into a state of Limbo, and wander the dream until you find a way out.Cobb's past is what I feel like the story builds itself on. Unless Cobb learns that the Mal (his wife) he sees in these dreams isn't the real one (cuz she's dead), the whole dream will collapse.This film is not only an amazing action thriller, but a deep, well- minded psychological drama as well. The characters must think in order to move to the next step, and synchronize their parts at the right time. This thought process is what makes me see not only a man wanting to see his kids again, but a team working together to make it happen, which is why I recommend this movie to you, the reader of this review.",10,0,2,9 September 2015
