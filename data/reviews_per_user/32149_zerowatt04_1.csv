Iron Man 3," If you are not a comic-book nerd, you'll probably love it.
","Don't really care about the comics? Go for it. It's a solid package. Better than the first two IM movies in many ways, especally in terms of developing Tony Stark as a character. You'll see a lot of hate for this movie out there. Well, that comes from comicbook fanatics. This movie deviates from the comics. But if you don't care for the comics, I don't see any problems with this movie. Enjoy.",7,0,2,20 May 2016
