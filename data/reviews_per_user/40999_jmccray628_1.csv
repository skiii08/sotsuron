Resident Evil: Afterlife," Where did they get chocolate milk from in a prison without electricity?
",Here are other questions:1. Where did Alice get the fuel for hot pink airplane? 2. How did Alice charge her camcorder? 3. When did zombies start running and swimming? 4. Who was the villain wearing the shades? 5. Where did the monster with the big ax come from? 6. Why mention two characters are brother and sister and then give us no plot?This was a horrible movie without a plot. I'm happy I didn't pay for it but I had to post because it does an injustice to the video game series.i watched this film in horror. It appeared to be just thrown together to make money. i hope the next one stay true to the games because this one is horrible.,1,2,5,6 June 2011
