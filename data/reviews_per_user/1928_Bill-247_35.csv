Vertigo," One of Hitchcock 2nd best films ever!!!!! score: 9 (out of 10)
","Hitchcock always had a certain passion for using either Cary Grant or James Stewart in his 1950's films.  They probably could have played any of the lead characters for any Hitchcock movie. Here, however, James Stewart would have been the best choice.  'Vertigo' (1958) is my choice for 2nd best Hitchcock film - the first being 'Psycho' (1960).  I will not go into a lot of detail for this movie because you have to 'pay attention' from beginning to end in order to grasp what is going on.  All I can say is that Hitchcock directs this movie with more style and flare than 'North by Northwest' (1959).",Null,2,4,13 December 1998
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of Spielberg's best action movies - a winner!! score: 10 (out of 10)
","One of the best Indy movies is the original...so far.  There is never a dull moment in this movie, which is one of the top ten best movies from the 1980's.  It follows archaeologist, Indiana Jones, and his pursuit of the Ark of the Covenant.  He eludes snakes, Nazis, head hunters, and a giant rolling boulder!  He also manages time for romance with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and the two catapult from one non-stop action scene to another.  The special effects at the end are excellent!!!  John Williams score makes you want to go out and buy a fedora.",Null,0,0,7 December 1998
Citizen Kane," A TRIUMPH IN HOLLYWOOD MOVIE MAKING!!!
","ORSON WELLES WAS A YOUNG LAD OF 25 WHEN HE STARTED WORKING ON 'CITIZEN KANE'.  MANY CRITICS HAVE FELT THAT THIS FILM IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE. IT IS HARD TO SAY WHAT IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE...IT DEPENDS ON ONE'S POINT OF VIEW - AND THAT POINT OF VIEW HAS BEEN SHARED BY MANY WHEN IT COMES TO REVIEWING THIS FILM. THE STORY BEGINS, OR RATHER IS THE END OF AN ERA, FOR CHARLES FOSTER KANE (WELLES).  HE REPEATEDLY WHISPERS 'ROSEBUD'. WE DO NOT FIND OUT UNTIL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE WHO HE IS REFERRING TO.  THE BEST SCENE IN KANE, I THINK, IS WHEN HE IS WATCHING HIS WIFE SING AN OPERATIC SOLO FROM A BALCONY THEATRE BOOTH.  SHE SINGS SO HORRIBLY AND THE AUDIENCE GIVES HER SOME MINIMAL APPLAUSE.  THREE SECONDS LATER, KANE STARTS TO SLOWLY CLAP AND THEN CLAP SO LOUDLY THAT THE AUDIENCE CLAPS ALONG WITH HIM - A SIGN OF HIS POWER AS A NEWSPAPER TYCOON.  THE MOVIE GAINED MUCH PUBLICITY LATER ON, ESPECIALLY WHEN RANDOLPH HEARST STARTED TO DENOUNCE IT.  I THINK IT IS A LANDMARK FILM IN TERMS OF THE ACTING, SCREENPLAY, AND BRILLIANT BLACK AND WHITE CINEMATOGRAPHY.  AND WHY NOT FILM IT IN BLACK AND WHITE? KANE'S LIFE WAS DARK AND DREARY ANYWAY.  A HOLLYWOOD MASTERPIECE!",Null,2,3,6 December 1998
L.A. Confidential," EVERYTHING IS ON THE HUSH HUSH...A GREAT FILM!!!
","THIS IS A NOT A SIMPLE FILM...AND ONE MUST PLAY CLOSE ATTENTION FROM BEGINNING TO END TO GET THE ENTIRE GRASP OF THE MOVIE.  IF YOU MISS A LITTLE, YOU MAY MISS A LOT, LET'S SAY.  THE FILM IS NARRATED BY DANNY DEVITO IN THE BEGINNING ABOUT THE GOING'S ON AT HUSH HUSH MAGAZINE - A SORT OF 'NATIONAL ENQUIRER' OF THE 1950'S.  AFTERWARDS, THE FILM PROGRESSES QUICKLY...SOON WE ARE CAUGHT UP IN HOLLYWOOD, PROSTITUTION, AND POLICE INVESTIGATIONS - THE CENTRAL THEMES OF THE MOVIE, ALL OF WHICH INTERTWINE NICELY AND SERVE ONE CENTRAL PLOT AT THE END.  RUSSELL CROWE, GUY PIERCE, JAMES CROMWELL, KEVIN SPACEY, AND KIM BASINGER (OSCAR WINNER) PLAY THEIR PARTS BRILLIANTLY.  THE FILM IS DIRECTED SUPERBLY BY CURTIS HANSON. ALREADY.  ENOUGH SAID.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's doomsday comedy masterpiece!!!!! score: 9 (out of 10)
","Kubrick's masterpiece 'Dr. Strangelove' couldn't have come out at a better time than during the Cold War era.  There are many superb performances in this movie, especially Peter Sellers in three roles (President Muffley, Col. Mandrake, and Dr. Strangelove)...I thought he should have received an Oscar.  George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden lend superb support roles as well...even when Hayden is serious - he's funny!!! The screenplay deserved its rich Oscar!!!  There are many funny scenes in the film...especially when Sellers is on the phone with the Soviet Premier - a true Hollywood classic scene.  The special effects are convincing at times, however, one can tell that Kubrick used a model plane for the flying sequences.  The ending scene where Strangelove has a fight with his mechanical arm is rather unnecessary.  Superb Laurie Johnson score.  score: 9 (out of 10).",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Empire is brought to its knees...in the final chaper!!!!
","Many critics, including me, feel this is the weakest installment into the Star Wars trilogy.  I feel the reason behind it is that there is too much familiar going on too quickly.  There is: the battle to destroy the Second Death Star (a theme from the original movie), the battle between father and son continues (a theme from the second movie), and the love affair between Han and Leia is a slight distraction (also a theme from the second movie).  The new list of characters is impressive - the cuddly Ewoks and the vile Jabba the Hutt make their initial appearances.  (We can also get a glimpse of a skinnier Jabba in Star Wars IV: A New Hope - New Edition version).  The beginning is the best part of the movie...although the special effects keep us glued from beginning to end.",Null,0,0,12 December 1998
Alien," It's an Alfred Hitchcock type of tale...set in the confines of space...score: 8 (out of 10)
","Ridley Scott must have been a fan of Alfred Hitchcock to create a stunning horror film set in the remote regions of space. The tagline couldn't be more true than by saying, 'in space where no one can hear you scream'.  How true.  The set design is gothic in detail...superbly created!!!  This sets the tension of the film as well.  The acting is superb!!!",Null,0,1,13 December 1998
Taxi Driver," One of the top ten best films of the 1970's!!! score: 10 (out of 10)
","I'm sorry, Mr. Leonard Maltin if I offend you about your review, but this film deserves better than just ** stars.  To my current knowledge, it ranks in the top ten best films of the 1970's which puts it up there with the two Godfather movies, 'Star Wars', and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.  The movie has superb cinematography, screenplay, music score, acting, and direction.  It has been voted by many critics of film and cinema in the top ten films of the 1970's.  But, I guess, you are entitled to your opinion, which was not entirely objective by any means.",Null,0,0,13 January 1999
The Godfather: Part II," A Hollywood Masterpiece!!!!
","Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives of the infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, 'The Godfather'.  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael's struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb.",Null,122,167,6 December 1998
North by Northwest," A top notch Hitchcock film...score: 9 (out of 10)
","I am not much of a Hitchcock guru as some people are mainly because I find most of his films as being the same type of scenario - human chasing something or someone, or human being chased by something or someone.  No where is this more evident than in this movie.  The film opens when Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) comes out of his Madison Avenue office to attend a social gathering at a local bar.  While he is in the bar, two thugs mistake him for a double agent and, of course, he is abducted.  He is transferred to the whereabouts of a certain Mr. Lester Townsend (James Mason).  I am not going to give out any more details except from there on out, Thornhill winds up being chased and chases the culprits, who want to see his demise, to the final scene at Mount Rushmore.  Along the way, he finds time for romance with a certain lady friend (Eva Marie Saint).  The best part of the movie happens when Thornhill is pursued through a cornfield by a crop duster - a classic Hitchcock scene.",Null,1,1,13 December 1998
Apocalypse Now," A great Vietnam War film, but not a total masterpiece...score: 8 (out of 10)
","I am inclined to view 'Platoon' (1986) as THE BEST film about the Vietnam War over this movie.  The first half of this film is a masterpiece, however, as the movie proceeds we are caught up in the chaos of a tyrannical Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and his living hell.  Sure, war is hell, and that's the point of the movie.  I can even see why Brando felt his performance should be filmed in the dark.  When Robert Duvall's character, Colonel Kilgore, commands the village attack sequence, we are brought into the 'reality' of the Vietnam conflict.  But, somehow, the search for an insane colonel in the second half of the movie didn't agree with me.  In other words, the flow of the movie was uneven, but it is still a great film.",Null,0,0,13 December 1998
Aliens," A great sequel to the original. score: 8 (out of 10)
","James Cameron has a field day with this film...a stunning sequel to the original film, 'Alien'.  Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) returns to the planet where the Nostromo had originally encountered a hideous, reptilian creature.  The film has plenty of action and tension...you won't be bored. Weaver's acting is superb.  The best way to view it, however, is on the big screen.",Null,0,0,13 December 1998
The Exorcist," Ultimate horror film...should have been called 'Eyes Wide Shut'...score: 10 (out of 10)
","There are many GREAT horror films of the 20th Century on film, however, here is a film where I keep my eyes wide shut when I see it.  William Friedkin brings to us the ultimate in horror movies - a simple story about the Devil and demonic possession. The actors give superb performances.  Some have said the movie is slow, but that is the point.  If we are to understand the plot, we must first understand the characters involved.  The superb special effects steal the show as well (especially when the Devil uses Megan's body to spin his head around and reveal his true identity to the priest...again...my eyes were wide shut!)  A top-notch thriller...score: a PERFECT 10!!! (out of 10.)",Null,0,0,2 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The best film of the 1990's - a masterpiece!!!!
","Most war films have one common denominator or two...they either have a give 'em hell attitude ('The Longest Day'), or they deal with an anti-war theme ('Apocalypse Now').  This film does both...only on a larger scale.  It has some fine acting (Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Ted Danson), but that is not how I saw this movie.  This movie is about war in all of its infinite inhumanity...and you are there...right at the front lines...watching men brutally dying around you.  In 'Apocalypse Now', this was shown to a degree...then all of a sudden, we are swept up into a chaotic nightmare about a renegade Colonel who goes over the edge.  This film explores war on a more real life scale.  When the boats arrive at Omaha Beach...you feel what the soldiers feel.  When the men decide to go after Ryan, you feel their courage...and their probable destiny.  Movies like 'The Deer Hunter', 'Coming Home', and 'Paths of Glory' all gave us a reason to hate war.  This film does the same, however, it explores all of the reasons for wanting to go to war...and fighting for what you believe in.  This is Spielberg at his finest...the flip side to Schindler's List.  The cinematography, special effects, sound, and score all are done perfectly...a masterpiece of American film making in the last decade of the 20th Century.",Null,0,0,12 December 1998
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the BEST films of the 1960's...A Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Stanley Kubrick's saga of evolution from 'The Dawn of Man' to the year 2001 is a brilliant tale of the physical and technical development of mankind.  Everytime I hear 'The Blue Danube', an immediate vision of outer space exploration fills my imagination...thanks to the wonder of this film.  Today, we are already fulfilling that vision of Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke.  When I first saw this film on the super wide screen in THX sound, I was blown out of my seat.  The film is a close tie with Star Wars in my book as THE best in outer space movies.  Notice I didn't say science fiction...I have never considered this movie to be science fiction, but a mere prophecy that has come true when it was first developed.  Today, as all computer programmers know, computers do what we tell them to do through software programs.  Many people have considered HAL by itself to be a villain in this movie.  I say 'NO'.  HAL was programmed by a human being.  The human(s) who developed HAL were the TRUE enemy...judge for yourself.  A true masterpiece of film making...it will last for centuries to come.

Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick has done it again...another masterpiece!!! score: 9 (out of 10).
","Stanley Kubrick creates an atmosphere that even Freud would have cherished. I have been a big lover of Kubrick movies for a long time.  Almost like Hitchcock, he paints films in such a way that makes the audience want to 'think' rather than 'react' (for example: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove, etc.)  In this film, he does the same thing.  This is a movie that clearly asks the question:  what is the purpose of marriage?  This is a film that is the flip side of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Kubrick makes excellent use of Cruise and Kidman in husband and wife role. score: 9 (out of 10).",Null,0,0,16 August 1999
Some Like It Hot," One of Billy Wilder's best films!!! A winner!!! score: 10 (out of 10)
",There are at least three films from the 1950's that I enjoy watching the most over and over again - The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) The Searchers (1956) and this one - a hilarious spoof about two men (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) who witness a mob hit and flee the state on a train - dressed as women in an all girl band! Poop poopy doop!!  The screenplay is classic. The direction is outstanding.,Null,1,2,6 December 1998
Pulp Fiction," A WONDERFUL FILM ABOUT THE MOB AND REDEMPTION
","FOUR STORIES ARE INTERTWINED INTO A FINAL PLOT.  ONE STORY, WHICH I FOUND THE MOST INTERESTING, CENTERED AROUND TWO MOB HIT MEN (PLAYED BY JOHN TRAVOLTA AND SAMUEL L. JACKSON).  IN ANOTHER STORY, A DOWN AND OUT BOXER (EXCELLENTLY PORTRAYED BY BRUCE WILLIS) WORKS FOR A BIG TIME MOBSTER.  THE STORY LINES ARE CLASSIC.

Titanic," James Cameron's epic romance/disaster movie. Score: 8 (out of 10)
","James Camerson's epic romance/disaster movie - a film that made big at the Box Office, but doesn't do too much for me.  I have seen the movie several times.  It's half and half (half romance - the other half disaster).  What does make the movie set sail for me is the outstanding special effects - most worthy of an Oscar as well as the set design, sound, and costumes.  The plot behind the disaster is rather more or less a soap opera type love affair between the two young lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). Somewhere during the love affair...I was reminded of the remake of King Kong (1976) - remember the love affair between Jessica Lange and the famous big gorilla?",Null,1,2,6 December 1998
Psycho," One of Hitchcock's best films...a masterpiece!!! score: 9 (out of 10)
","No one on Earth has captured the art of 'horror' or 'suspense' on film better than Alfred Hitchcock.  His three best films that come to my mind are 'Vertigo' (1958), 'North by Northwest' (1959) and this one...his all-time greatest masterpiece, although some people think 'Lifeboat' (1944) is his finest film to date.  I can remember when I first saw this film...my friend's mother refused to let her son watch such a stupid, slasher film.  I laughed.  This is not a typical 'slasher' film, but a story about embezzlement, greed, adultery, and murder...all of the ingredients that make up a Hitchcock movie. The 'Friday the 13th' movies are what make up a typical 'slasher' movie simply because there is no plot other than the constant 'slashing' of people.  This Hitchcock movie has a plot, of which I am not going to go into a lot of detail.  After devising a scheme to embezzle her boss out of a chunk of money, Marion Crane winds up fleeing town, and her job, for her lover (John Gavin).  During a terrible rain storm, she finds vacancy in the Bates Motel, which is run by the shy and innocent Norman Bates.  What I found so interesting about this movie is the pace, the tone, the timing, the music, the house where Norman lives, and the confines of a simple motel room, and of course, the shower...all of which lead to murder and mayhem in a stylish, provocative manner.  Roger Ebert's review of the movie is correct...at the end...the shrink's description of Norman is dull and overblown.  If Hitch could have tightened that scene up just a bit...the film could have been totally flawless.",Null,5,9,13 December 1998
The Bridge on the River Kwai," THE BEST anti-war film in the 20th century!!!
","There are about only three films from the 1950's that cling to me like a fly to sugar - 'The Searchers' (1956), 'Some Like it Hot' (1959) and this film. It is by far THE BEST anti-war film ever made...other people will say 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) or 'Platoon' (1986).  They are GREAT films about the horrors of Vietnam, and war in general.  But, no film in the 20th century has described the horrors of war (in terms of the torture, brutality, or the insanity of war) better than this film.  You feel the 'heat' of that oven when they place Nicholson (Alec Guinness) in it.  You feel his pain.  You cheer his release along with his comrades.  When I first saw this movie, I thought William Holden was the hero.  Now, that I have seen this movie several times, it is hard to single out any hero of the film because all of them were heroes in their own right...and it was the total idea of 'war' in general that made their lives a living hell.",Null,0,1,13 December 1998
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of my favorite comedy movies of the 20th century!!!
","There are many GREAT comedies of the 20th century on film, such as The Graduate (1967), Some Like It Hot (1959), etc.  But, I have to argue that this film does it for me.  Jack Nicholson displays a top-notch performance as Randall P. McMurphy.  McMurphy is an ex-con who's doing time in a mental hospital in order to avoid doing hard labor.  The hospital staff see this and want to send him back.  McMurphy wins the admiration of his fellow patients, and becomes the leader of the group.  However, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher, Best Actress Oscar) has different plans.  As a means to show her dominance over McMurphy, she tests his character by punishing him, and the other patients, with certain rules and mental/physical torture.  The movie is not totally humorous either, but even frightening too.  There is one nightmarish scene in the movie when McMurphy undergoes ECT.  Many other different events ensue, which pit McMurphy against the control of Ratched.  The ending is both a tragedy and a triumph of the human spirit.  Excellent acting and screenplay.

Now, many years later, I have seen Jaws many, many times.  I have even read and seen how they made the film.  The special effects are considered today to be standard...and one can tell the fake shark scenes from the real ones.  The acting, cinematography, and direction, however, have held up over the years.  All of the characters are still convincing in detail, which says a lot about Steven's directing.  It was the film that made Steven Spielberg a household name.",Null,2,5,7 December 1998

Kubrick's film is still top notch. It has good battle sequences...the sound of bombs flying in the air is remarkable. The acting is good.  'Kwai' does a better job of describing the horrors of war.  The acting in 'Kwai' is much better.  However, the screenplay for this movie is better than 'Kwai'.

","Very seldom does a movie appeal to the tastes of everyone.  This movie is not really science fiction although some say it is the best sci-fi movie to date.  It is more of a fairy tale, which is set in a galaxy far, far away. It has all the ingredients of a fairy tale: good vs. evil, the dashing prince charmings coming to the rescue of a princess, and lots of daring do along the way.  It's almost like the story of King Arthur in outer space. What sells it to the audience?  At that time, its special effects were considered a marvel of cinematic movie making.  Today, the special effects would be considered, well, okay.  The characters have become household names: Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kanobi, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO, and Princess Leia.  People, as a whole, have spent a zillion dollars on Star Wars' toys, video games, etc.  As a result, George Lucas became very rich and famous.  The movie's score is the best masterpiece of cinematic music ever recorded on film.  Lucas does a brilliant job of directing.  The film won 7 Academy Awards.  Harrison Ford became an international super star.  This all says a lot for just one movie!!! (well, not a whole lot...I could have gone on further and wrote a book about the success of this film.)

The best way to view it, of course, is in the theatre.  Much of the awe is lost on television.  The film picks up where the original film left off.  The Empire plots certain revenge for the band of freedom fighters on the icy planet of Hoth.  When all hopes for establishing a hidden base fails, the Alliance disbands, and so do the characters.  Luke hooks up with Yoda, who teaches him the way of the Force. Han and Leia spark a love affair.  C3PO and R2D2 add humor.  Darth Vader reveals a nasty secret to Luke.
