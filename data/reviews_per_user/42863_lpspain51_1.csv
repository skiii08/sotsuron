Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What is real and what is not
","As a Sound Designer, musician, and film maker, I found a masterpiece in Episode 1. Where some people found Lucas to be geared too much toward children or not enough romance these are all valid. Although it will sound ironic, I felt bad for Lucas. He was held up to an impossible standard from the get go. The film was technically flawless. The cast was a success. It was a litle corny but I almost found some humor in that. My only complaint was not the heavy presence of CGI but the absences the beautiful craftsmanship and organic appeal of puppets. It is not possible to beat an impossible standard, but I think Lucas did the best anyone could do.",Null,0,1,5 March 2000
