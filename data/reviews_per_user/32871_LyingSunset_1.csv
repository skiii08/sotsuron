The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A Loving and Touching Story
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a dramatic story that follows the first year of high school freshman Charlie. Meeting two amazing seniors who choose to show Charlie, a shy and socially awkward young man, the ropes of life and what its really about. Throughout the story you discover the history of Charlie and the secrets he has been hiding with the effects on his friends, family, and personal life. While heartbreaking and tear jerking, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing storyline that can bring life lessons and awareness to any individual. Wallflower is an appropriate movie for families with children thirteen and older, or children who are mature. The movie depicts scenes of sexual innuendo, societal issues, alcohol & drug use, as well as some potential strong language. There is homosexual scenes and discussion in the movie, as well as the actor who portrays the homosexual senior is homosexual in everyday life, meaning I would not recommend this movie to those who are homophobic or have difficulties accepting homosexuals in general. Other than that, its an amazing movie that any user should be able to enjoy!",10,0,1,7 September 2014
