Black Swan," Nathalie
","The movie is good and kept me in a tensed mode from beginning to end. While the music more than underscores the strong emotions felt by Nina, the Black Swan revolves solely on Nina and Nathalie Portman. Her performance is unique, remarkable, just mind blowing. Rarely have I seen an actor or actress so immensely inside of his/her character. This is an Oscar award, hands up. Back to the movie: take Nathalie Portman out and replace her with a good actress and you have a flop. My vote is a 10 for Nathalie and if the movie receives any other award, it will result from the deep emotion which Nathalie attaches to the movie. Like a magnificent perfume which remains for a very, very long time.",10,4,9,19 December 2010
Warrior," Cheap
","First comment on the community rating above 8: these must be MMA fans!
The movie in itself could be resumed to 10 minutes screening and would wipe out the catastrophic caricature of the players, all of them.
Nick Nolte stopped drinking for 1,000 days but of course gets back to it. His air of beaten dog is just how he looks, no need to perform.
Joel Edgerton is a professor of physics but also a mixed martial art fighter (this is to show that MMA is not only populated by brawling beasts).
Tom Hardy is the brute with a lot of excuses to cover his nihilism.
The rest of the crew is just there to try to make the fights exciting and make you jump out of your chair.
In a single word: pathetic.",5,2,5,21 October 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," From a great book to an average movie
","I confess: the movie was a disappointment. The book and the deepness of the characters is far superior. A book of course has far more potential when it comes to describe a large family over generations and their internal battles. The genealogy is important to understand the various relationships and I admit having had to go back to earlier passages to reposition the players. The book is magnificently constructed with far more content to the 'investigation' and the development of Lisbeth's character. It also seems that the book's intermediate end (what did really happen to Harriet) did not please the director, so he took a shortcut: open for discussion. In conclusion, people who did not read the book are likely to give the movie a higher rating. To them I strongly recommend to get the book and ... enjoy it.",7,2,5,21 April 2012
Saw III," Rating with blood
","This is a difficult film to rate considering its content versus its cinematography. Let's review the latter. The plot, scenario, jigsaw build-up, imagination, creativity and filming are really excellent. Sound and camera effects are mastered as well as scene lighting. For this I would give it an 8-9. How about rating the movie with its content? It is one thing to reflect on the deepest and sadistic side of human nature while dealing with an overall story concept. This was beautifully executed with The Silence of the Lambs. But in Saw III sadistic torture becomes the centerpiece. When further listening to comments by Leigh Whannell and director Daren Lynn Bousman, it shows that both enjoyed the subject and wanted to please the viewers. That is one thing which disturbed me. Then there is the subtle perversion to show the Jigsaw in a more understandable if not positive way: he is not a murderer, in opposition to Amanda, and the rules of his game always enable the victim to escape, at the expense of great pain of course. Finally, each civilization has its wave of torture, the most bloody examples going back to the Mayas, the Spanish Inquisition and more recently the Nazis. Do our present times miss torture to explain the appearance of the sagas of Saw and Hostel?",Null,0,0,24 January 2008
