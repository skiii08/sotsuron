Hereditary," That's terrible, Muriel
","Okay, so I went to the cinema purposefully not having listened to any of the hype. Love a good horror movie that is genuinely frightening and makes you jump. Unfortunately I found this a real let down. The first half is really slow. Really slow. The pace picks up a bit in the second half, but not enough. I am not sure what other reviewers found 'terrifying', perhaps there was something I missed. Not a satisfying ending either, just more of the same that is already out there. Such a disappointment for me unfortunately. Had I not gone to the cinema and seen this at home instead I doubt I would have made it to the end.",3,4,9,16 June 2018
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Good film, if you ignore the singing
","The first time I saw this I was not familiar with the story, soundtrack etc and really enjoyed it. It is absorbing and a great story. The problem comes when you see it somewhere else.I went to see this as a play, and I bought the soundtrack which was performed by Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton. I've also see a filmed stage version with Angela Landsbury. Unfortunately this has ruined the film for me. When I try to watch it again it really doesn't have the same charm.The singing is dreadful in comparison to the soundtrack. Also, some of the songs have been cut short which is really noticeable when you know them. Especially, in my view, the main song of the whole story - A Little Priest.Such a shame, I really held this film in high regard. Now, not so much.",5,0,0,27 April 2019
