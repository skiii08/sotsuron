","i cant believe it.everything was good.the cinematography,the score,the acting,the art direction,sound effects but the logic....charlie(foster) was ben's(crowe) sidekick for so many years.he was so loyal to him.he killed charlie and his whole gang for gunning evans(bale).ben killed his entire gang who were so loyal to him who travelled 80 miles to contention just because he suddenly became friend with bale.if he didn't want bale to be shot down then he could have said that to charlie.i don't know why and how bale and crowe agreed to that part. if im not correct or i did not understand the logic.please somebody enlighten me.",6,1,4,11 January 2008
