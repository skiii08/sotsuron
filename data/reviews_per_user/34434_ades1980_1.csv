The Avengers," Original and almost perfect
","I am still amazed by this movie. First i was a bit skeptic, since lot of movies with big names are not that good as you may suggest. But this? Original jokes, even when you don't suspect it. I laugh so hard, i was crying and is not a so called funny movie, like American pie.. The type of the characters are clearly distinguishable, and is the same as in the previous movies. But even if you didn't saw them, you can fully enjoy it, but if you did, it adds something extra. It's full of action, and even when it is not so much going on the screen you never feel like that something is missing or boring. It is the perfect movie to switch off, laugh hard and enjoy what's happening on the screen.",10,4,9,26 April 2012
