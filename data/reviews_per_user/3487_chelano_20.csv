Black Swan," white swan black swan
","This is a very interesting film. I really like how the whole movie went together. Now the one thing that some viewers might not like about the movie is how sexual the film is. It does play a part in the story. Like the more gritty dirtier version of Swan Lake. The cast is excellent. Natalie Portman is pretty intense and so strict in her life. While you have Mila Kunis who is more bubbly and willing to do anything. Winona Ryder is in the film but seems like she was dying. Couldn't tell if it was her or the character. Vincent Cassel is also pretty good as he pushes Portman's character to be the best. The film really has a dark feel to it showing how the mind can warp reality and take control. If you are not a fan of the theater, when you here Swan Lake, you think boring. But even though this seems like a different movie, it actually has the presence of Swan Lake in the background and it makes it very more interesting to think about.",8,0,1,7 October 2011
Iron Man 2," Iron suit....part duex
","Just as good as the first, but here is the problem. Now don't get me wrong. I am a comic nerd. In fact I had a total nerdgasim when watching this. But I will be serious. The story was a little rushed. The ending was resolved too quick at the end. You were kind of hoping for more of an epic battle, but you didn't get it. Now all the characters and the visual effects were amazing. So I give credit for that. But I just don't want them to make the same mistake as the Spider-Man movies; having them go slowly downhill. So the nerds out there, the movie had many references to the Avengers which is very exciting. Robert Downey Jr. was still the same quirky Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow seemed a little off as Pepper though. Don Cheadle was an excellent replacement from Terrance Howard for Rhodey. Not that Howard is a bad actor, it just seems like Cheadle wanted it more. Scarlett Johansson was a great Black Widow. She had the looks and the moves. Of course Samuel L. Jackson was good as Nick Fury. Then the two villains were Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Rockwell was pretty good. I really wish there was more of Rourke though. He is just 100% creepy and mean looking. Two side characters that were enjoyable were Jon Favreau, the director, and Clark Gregg who played Agent Coulson. So overall the cast was really good. I just wanted more from the story. But that doesn't mean that the movie was bad.",8,1,2,6 August 2010
Oldboy," Pain brought out in one weapon
","This movie just gets more and more intense until the end when you get shocked by the conclusion. The story is very good and will keep you interested till the very end. Min-sik Choi was amazing in this film. Imagine being locked up for 15 years. Now your cell is not bad, it is like a small dorm room with bad wallpaper. But you are fed the same food everyday and all you have is a crappy TV to watch. Being stuck in that small space will drive you nuts. You also find out by the TV that life is changing and that your wife is murdered and they say it was you. Yet it can't be because you are locked up. What do you do to keep yourself sane. Min-sik Choi's character Dae-su just became a beast within himself. A beast full of revenge against the character played by Yu Ji-tae who was also excellent. The rest of the cast is also great and really know how to act. The story is just one big pain in the mind. You try to figure it out and you can't be absolutely sure you got it, till the end of the film. And when that comes, you won't believe what happens. Great film and probably one of the best in that year from South Korea.",10,2,5,19 August 2010
"I Love You, Man"," Love
","I will say off the bat I hated the ended. It was like they ran out of time and the director said, 'just stop the film here'. The rest of the story was pretty good. I enjoyed the film, but I can see people hating it. All the characters have the personalities of the cast. So if you do not like any of these people as an actor or actress, you will hate the film. Paul Rudd was great in this film. His dialog was really funny. Jason Segel was a good double, but not his best movie. The movie had an excellent cast and I can say I enjoyed them all. Lou Ferrigno was a funny touch. I really think my favorite duo from the movie were Jon Favreau and Jaime Pressly. Some of the dialog was just great. So overall, a pretty good movie aside from some of the story flaws.",7,1,1,6 December 2010
Milk," Full of emotion
","This film had a lot of feeling behind it. It really shows a part of the world that people forget. It shows how everyone is human and everyone hurts. That everyone is equal because everyone bleeds red. Harvey Milk took a big step in life. He knew he would be hurt and the journey would be hard, but he did it because he cared. He cared for people like him and others in the world who also felt this pain. Sean Penn plays Harvey Milk and he does an amazing job. This is a great story and movie, but the movie did seem to rush and that was a problem. There was just too much info about Milk that could not be shown in one movie. Also some of the cast didn't seem to fit very well. James Franco seemed a little off par for me in this film. He was OK I guess, just didn't seem like he fit the character. At the end of the film in the credits they do show pictures of the real people from this film. It was very interesting to see how many of them really looked like the actors. So overall a very touching movie.",8,0,2,3 August 2010
The Expendables," Stallone has a leather face
","What happens when you take almost every action star who has been in at least one bad movie and put them together; you get a bad movie. Stallone directed and help write this film and it was not up to par at all. Now I am not a total hater of this film. I am sure it was interesting seeing Stallone's old skin in slow motion when he was running. But the film could of been better. The cast was fun to see. I loved seeing the newer action stars and the old ones work together. Even the cameos were great. The dialog for the most part was just as pathetic as the story. Pretty much just like the old action films you remember seeing. There were a few funny lines in the film though, so it did get a little of a laugh out of me. Now lets talk about the thing that the movie advertised; the action. Yes it had the action that was promised. All the cool fight scenes, bones breaking and gore. But some old action stars cannot move that fast so what do they do, they shake the camera. This really makes the viewer lose interest. Plus personally, I think there could of been more action. They did have a lot of serious scenes and with that dialog, it was pretty bad. Now, I don't know who was in charge of the CG, but it looked like something with a low budget. An example is a scene with Steve Austin. I would think with a hype like this, they could of made it look more real. All in all I enjoyed the film in bits and pieces. Also even thought I didn't enjoy the film all the way, just like the old action films, the movie did give off the man movie of the year. I don't know if it was Jet Li breaking someones neck or Terry Crews and his gun that kept me smiling at parts; you can see I liked it some. One thing really was on my mind when the movie ended though. I couldn't figure out who was uglier at their old age; Stallone or Rourke.",5,8,24,16 August 2010
Shutter Island," A creepy inner feeling
","This movie is all suspense with a touch a creepy. That makes a wonderful dish in the movie world. You will find yourself on the edge of your seat at many parts of the film and even feel a little uncomfortable. The cast for the most part was pretty good. But this is only the main cast. Some of the side characters were too fake for my taste. Leonardo DiCaprio was pretty good. I bet it was hard for him to play an older guy though since he always looks 18. Ben Kingsley was a joy. His character seemed so nice, but more in a creepy way and he really pulled it off. Mark Ruffalo was a good sidekick to DiCaprio. Michelle Williams seemed a little off though. Now when you get to the halfway point of the movie you will either figure out the twisted story or be confused out of your mind. I can see a lot of people getting frustrated with how this movie was written. I know it was made to be that way, but it really took some of the fun suspense out of the film. Every time this happened though, there were parts to get you right back into the film. Even though the story seems in small pieces and some back story was missing, I still think Scorsese did made a pretty decent film here and it is worth watching.",7,0,1,6 August 2010
Tangled," The horse....only the horse
","This movie was surprisingly pretty good. When I saw the trailer I really was not that interested and I wasn't even sure if I really liked the voice over choice. But I decided to give it a chance. I am glad I did, because I did enjoy the film. There were a few things that set me off a bit though. One is that you can watch it in 3D, yet the movie wasn't really made for it. I can only really remember a couple parts that really used the 3D effect. The other thing was the music. Alan Meken did the score for the movie. He also did the score for the Little Mermaid. So this movie seriously felt like I was watching the Little Mermaid every time someone would sing. It was like he took sound clips and words from that movie and put it in this movie. For the most part, the animation was decent and fun, but not amazing. The voice over cast really did fit with the characters. Zachary Levi did fit his character and I thought he wouldn't. Mandy Moore did a great job as her character. They managed to put a little lizard and a horse in the film for fun characters to watch and enjoy and I am glad they did. I really did enjoy the horse. That character had me laughing a lot. So overall, it was not the best, but it was a fun movie to watch.",7,1,6,2 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Only one more to go
","It is hard to rate and review these movies after awhile. There are so many and some I loved while others I didn't. One thing is that every new movie there is something different they try and it either wins or fails. This movie had both. The win was focusing on the main characters more as grown ups than as kids and it really worked. I felt like I was watching more of an adult fantasy type movie. The fail was the use of action scenes. They tried the whole, 'shaking the camera' to add special effect and more of the real to the action shots. This really took away from the film and even started giving me a headache. I am glad it was not in 3D because I probably would of passed out. The cast was still great and Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson blossom with each movie. The rest of the characters are fun to watch as always and a joy to see act. This film is darker than most of the other movies and did have some more passion towards characters too. So I did enjoy how it was filmed, but not the shaking camera. One more Harry Potter to go and it is over. Hopefully it will end and it will be a good end to a great series and everyone can focus on something new.",7,2,4,2 December 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Beautiful from start to finish
","It has been along time since I enjoyed a movie from start to finish. This was that movie. This film was jam packed with action, laughs and just lovable characters you want to see more and more of. Michael Cera was a pretty good choice for Scott. I mean usually Cera only has one type of way to act and somehow it really did fit for Pilgrim. It will take me forever to explain how much I liked the cast, so I will only pick a choice few. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great as Ramona. She had the look you could picture from the comic itself. Then you have Ellen Wong as Knives. The way Ellen acted in this film really brought out have Knives really was in the comic. Out of the evil Ex's, I really enjoyed Jason Schwartzman. He just had an overall cool yet kept feeling and at a point you really wanted him to fight more against Pilgrim. The other Ex would have to be Brandon Routh. I really cannot stand him as Superman, but this role he got to act more like his personality. I mean every actor has a dream to act as a crazy character, because then they can be more comfortable. I think Brandon was very comfortable in the role. The movie had a beautiful look to it with great nerdy CG throughout. The movie did have two problems though. The fight scenes were not long enough. This is because the movie was almost two hours and it is hard to fit seven fight scenes in to seven Ex's. But even though they were short, the look, feel and graphics to them still really made them exciting. The other problem is that I know this film will never has a perfect rating overall because it really only fits to a certain type of people. Luckily there is a lot of people who will love this movie like I did, but in the world today, this film will probably not win an academy award; and that is sad.",10,11,30,15 August 2010
District 9," Awww Baby Bug Alien
","When I first heard about this film I was interested. Later a bunch of people I knew saw it and some said it was too gory and the story was stupid. Well I finally decided to watch it for myself and I really liked it. First off I will mention the gore. Yes there is some, but not even close to over the top. I have seen war movies with more gore. The only reason they show gore is from the effect of the alien weapons which is great. It is meant to scare you. The story was not bad at all. An alien race is stuck by Earth and the people of Earth try to get the aliens their own area to live in, but after awhile treat them like a lower class. It takes one human to realize that the aliens have feeling like anyone else. The human is played by Sharlto Copley who did a fantastic job in his role. He was so into his character, I couldn't stop watching. The CG in the film was not too bad. For they were CGing aliens and not humans. When you CG humans, it looks to fake. Since these aliens were more original, it was easier to believe they were alive. The weird thing though is that the aliens were mostly like giant bugs. At first it seems a little strange, but you get use to it. Now if the movie needed something for the ladies, how about a baby alien. Yes that is right. A little alien that makes you go awwww. So overall this was a pretty entertaining movie with some suspense added in. I will admit that the ending was a little off, but it was not horrible. I guess you are looking for more of a intense ending. There is tons of intensity leading up to it though.",8,1,8,26 November 2010
1941," John Belushi and a plane
","This film had a great cast. You get to see a lot of people who were also in Animal House. Actually it was kind of like Animal House, but with war. Sorry to say that the story was really bad though and the movie wasn't as funny as I would like to see. It was directed by Steven Spielberg, so you get to see a lot of action and damage. So the action plus the fun to watch characters is what made this movie OK since it was so bad other wise. Now out of all the characters, there were two that really made me laugh. First was Dan Aykroyd. He didn't have the biggest part and in the beginning he was not too amusing. Later though he gets hit in the head and gets crazy. That is what made me laugh. Then you have John Belushi. His character was funny no matter what he was doing. So overall again, it was just an OK movie. I wish there was a little more comedy or a little more story and maybe I would of liked it more than I did.",5,0,1,6 August 2010
2012," Not gonna happen
","OK was this movie a joke? I can't believe they still spend this much money and write such crap. I will give the film two good points. The CG was pretty good. When the world is being destroyed, the CG makes you really feel a chill thinking that is what it could look like. The other thing was the cast. All the cast members were good. The lines they were giving to read were not. Wait, there was one actor who was not that good. It was Woody Harrelson's character. They really could of made a really interesting character for his role and what he plays in the movie. But they made his character a crazy person and for some reason, Harrelson could not pull it off. The biggest problem in this movie was the writing. Everything was so predicable and cliché. It got to a point where I started to laugh because it got so cheesy. The last movie that made me laugh like that was Dragon Wars. Also if I had a dollar for every person who wanted to stay behind in this film and die. Speaking of dying, a lot of people did die in the film and it seemed like no one really cared. Someone would die and they would be like, OK; time for the next scene. The ending of the film was not even exciting enough to even care about and they could of added more, but the film was running long enough. I just didn't feel like seeing another hour of special landmarks getting crushed or blown up. If you took those scenes out, the movie would be 30 minutes long.",3,1,2,3 August 2010
I Am Legend," Yes you aren't
","This was a tough movie to rate. I found myself hating and liking parts of the film. I really like the feeling of how it is just Will Smith and the dog for the longest time. It gives you a creepy and uneasy feel. But I really hate the mutated people. Most of the CG was just horrible for this film. Especially the animals. But overall, the story was OK with a pretty crappy ending. You would want to see an amazing ending to this strange story, but you just don't get it. I would of also liked to see more from the side characters like Alice Braga. So I don't know. I rated the movie neutral for the fact that I did enjoy it till the end even though I hated some of the scenes. So I would say the movie is worth seeing at least once.",5,1,1,6 December 2010
Kick-Ass," Only some scenes 'kicked ass'
","The whole concept of the film was pretty interesting, but the writing for it was not that good. The story was pretty uneventful or in lament terms; stupid. Plus the fact they set the movie up to be non stop fighting and there really wasn't that much. So all you could ask for was the action to make up for it. Some of it did, but not really. Here is why I liked the movie though. I love the cast, a few scenes really did 'kick ass' and the story did have potential even though it was not done right. I guess I couldn't help but like the film even though there were so many things wrong. The best cast member was Chloe Moretz. Her acting and fighting was so great, they could make a movie just about her. Aaron Johnson was decent as the main character. He is mostly a nerd who really couldn't fight. Then you have the villain who is Christopher Mintz-Plasse. He was pretty funny. Now Nicolas Cage was just OK and there is one scene that was so stupid I wanted to punch Cage in the face and say, 'why did you agree to this?' So overall this is an interesting movie. I am sure they will make more and I think it has potential to do better. Just have to wait and see.",6,1,5,3 August 2010
Ip Man," Wing Chun is really fast
","This film is based on a true story about Yip Man. He was the first to teach the art of Wing Chun that was first introduced by a woman. This is way all the other martial art masters at this time made fun of him. But he proved that it was just as strong and takes a lot of focus making the people around him respect it more. Some still wanted to challenge him though because they believe this art was fake. During this time Yip Man was rich, but the Japanese invaded China and took over his house and money. Being poor, he shows that the love of a family and the love of his art could get him by and one day, make him famous. In fact Yip Man actually helped train Bruce Lee. There are many great actors in this film, but I will mention a few that stick out. The star who plays Yip Man is Donnie Yen, who really shows how fast Wing Chun can be. He has a small rival in the film who is Fan Siu-Wong. He believed his style was stronger than Wing Chun. The last person I will touch base on is Hiroyuki Ikeuchi who played the Japanese general who thinks that Japanese Kung Fu is better than Chinese Kung Fu. Throughout the film you will see many different fighting styles played by great martial artist actors who appear in various US and international films. The film has an OK and touching story. The only problem is at times the story seemed in pieces. This was because they did not want to make the film super long and concentrated more on the fight scenes. But the fight scenes were a pleasure to watch and you can tell they were well planned out. Even though the story is in pieces, you see by the end what the whole picture is about and realize that Yip Man was a great man in Chinese history.",8,0,1,13 September 2010
Alice in Wonderland," A nice warped look
","I had many people tell me this movie was horrible. But they don't know what they are talking about. Lets split it up. First off, it is not the original, this takes place a lot later in Alice's life. I will admit that the whole story was pretty bland. But the characters and who that casted were perfect to the T; with a few errors. I couldn't think of a better cast. Then add in Tim Burton's mind and you got some great visuals. Mia Wasikowska was a decent Alice. Helena Bonham Carter played an excellent, yet strange Red Queen. Ann Hathaway was not a good White Queen, I will admit that. Crispin Glover was a very strange Stayne, but it was perfect for his personality. Matt Lucas had the perfect personality for Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Then Alan Rickman had the perfect voice for the Blue Caterpillar. A smaller part I enjoyed was by Paul Whitehouse who played the March Hare. His character was really funny. Now I wanted to mention my two favorite characters. Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat. The Hatter had a double personality. When he was calm and nice his voice was soft with a lisp. When he got angry it would be a strong Scottish accent. Depp had this perfect. The design and CG of the Cheshire was a joy and Fry had the voice perfect for it. So overall, the visual and the personality of the film was amazing to watch. It just really needed a stronger story.",7,0,1,14 October 2010
Inception," In your dreams
","Not the very beginning, but about 10 minutes or so into the movie, I didn't know what to think. I felt like a lot was left out and I was going to be pretty confused. But it picked up very fast and got to the main part making the rest of the movie pretty much perfect in my eyes. The excitement was just too intense at parts. The suspense had me at the edge of my seat at times wondering what I was going to see next. The ending was one of the best parts. Watch and you will see. The writers really had something going here. The ability to control yours and others dreams. To bring a team into someones mind and help control their dream. The ability to make a dream, within a dream. This really was written by great minds and Nolan really directed it well. The movie is just shy of 2 and a half hours, but it doesn't really seem like it, because you will enjoy this film. The cast was excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio was great. Ellen Page was also a great second. Cillian Murphy stayed more quiet, but still could act. My medal of great acting has to go to Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Never thought I would see him in such a fighting type role, but it really fit for him. Unfortunately, Tom Berenger gets the award for not acting as well. I think he is just getting too old maybe. This movie has some great action shots and the CG is pretty good too. Pure suspense from start to finish. Great film, great cast, great writing.",8,4,8,3 August 2010
Iron Man," Iron suit...pure hero
","Robert Downey Jr was a perfect Tony Stark. Jon Favreau said in an interview that he did not want to make this movie cheesy because he is such a comic book fan. I give him props because he really did make a great movie. It had very small weak points which is why I did not give it a perfect rating. But the look, the feel, the image, the acting all fit together into a memorial comic movie. Which is hard to say about a lot of comic book movies. They really have to add something extra to make a great film package and that is what they did. They did not focus too much on the power of the hero, but the story which really helps. Terrence Howard was decent. Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty good and Pepper. Jeff Bridges made a perfect villain. This movie is a top for comic book movies. Great film.",9,0,1,6 August 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," I loved the cuss out of this film
","Very interesting to see an animated film by Wes Anderson, but I loved it. It is a film that both adults and kids can enjoy. All the characters in the film were excellent. You really get addicted to watching them. The voice talent was a great pick also. George Clooney was the perfect voice for Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox really had the same personality as him. Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and even Willem Dafoe as an evil farmer. They really knew who to pic for this cast. This film really brought me back to a feeling when I was younger and would watch shows animated like this in the mid day. The film gives you a certain joy and happiness in your heart and believe it or not, you feel like you need more. You wouldn't think that a film like this could make you feel excitement, but it will. You truly get an inner energy while watching. The movie is cute, funny and really has a great story. Plus there are little things that happen that make this film more original. The script has many parts when the actor should swear. But instead of swearing, they say the word cuss. So it would be something like this. 'What the cuss do you think you are doing?' Every time that happened, it made me laugh. Also, remember that they are wild animals. So when the foxes eat, they eat all crazy like. This is a very charming and fun to watch film.",10,1,3,13 August 2010
