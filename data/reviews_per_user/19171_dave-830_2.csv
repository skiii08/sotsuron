The Blair Witch Project," You gotta listen
","Some of the people I know who have seen this film, who didn't like it, usually didn't listen to what some people may call 'unimportant bits'. This means that later in the film they become a bit lost and don't understand as well as they should. I have always told them to watch it again. After doing so most enjoy it much more. I thought the film was good, not the greatest, but good and definitely worth watching if your going to watch it properly. I don't go for scary/horror films very often, I find them a bit corny and tedious, but this was different, no flying limbs etc. just suspense done very well.",8,0,1,2 November 2000
Pulp Fiction," My fave, gotta be a ten!
","This is without doubt my favourite film. The acting, casting, soundtrack, story and direction are, in my opinion second to none. It is violent, and thats not why I enjoyed it so much (although I can see why some would not like the film because of the excess of the violence) but it is funny, moving and had me on the edge of my seat throughout. You've got to see it at least once (maybe not as much as I have watched it possibly) or you are missing out.",10,0,1,2 November 2000
