E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," In my short opinion.
","This movie show us a sympathy between an alien and a human. they could communicate with each other by telepathy. Also. They connected with telepathy or something special. So, both was one. Either E.T or Eliot hurt, if that happened, another one would also get hurt. In movie, although E.T was died, Eliot could survive fortunately. And by a miracle, E.T was revived again, and they successfully ran away from the F.B.I. And then E.T went to his planet. An alien and a human, they could communicate, it's very interesting for me. really, Does an alien exist? I think , they could exist long time ago and somewhere. but now. they can't exist at least in the earth. however,they might exist other solar system. Anyway, A hero never dies.",Null,0,1,6 November 2009
