Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 'One Of The Best Films Of The Year.'
","Bill's Quotes: Superman's costume is not superman it's Clarke Kent.  His other personality is Clark Kent, He was born Superman.'  What Bill(David Carradine) is trying to explain is that Uma's character was born as the Black Mamba, her alter ego is 'The Bride.'   SPOILERS AHEADQuentin once again proves that he is a master film maker and he is God in Hollywood.  What he try's to do is show who these characters are.  You learn to like Bill inspite of yourself, we know he's a horrible person, we know he's a killer, his talent is killing, but we do know he obviously loves her. He did a horrible act out of love for her.Chris Rock's Quote: 'Have you ever loved somebody so much that sometimes you want to kill them.' That quote sort of makes sense in this film. This is a Quentin Tarantino love story. Some people feel sorry for Bill because he loves her. Not that people will kill in the name of love, but some have. Now all of a sudden Uma Thurman is the bad guy for at least a little while, but you feel sympathetic to her aim as well. She wants revenge, because he did wrong by her, she feels betrayed, like he cheated her in some way, cheated her by taking the idea of a normal life for her and her baby.I don't like Bill, but I do understand why he did what he did, and I understand why the Bride feels so angry. And with there last words, Bill Quotes: I love you Kiddo.  The Bride Quotes: I love you to. In my opinion, this is one of the craziest and one of the best love story's ever created.I give this film 4/4 stars.",10,0,1,9 August 2004
Minority Report," 'The Best Film of The Year.'
","Which is a better film, 'Minority Report' or 'Blade Runner?'  I believe that 'Minority Report,'is  why, because of the plot. 'Blade Runner' focused more on 3D effects than on the human story. What I love about 'Blade Runner' is the vision of the future and the settings that were both dark and somber. 'Minority Report' is also a dark and yet beautiful film. But I have to give credit to 'Metropolis'(1925), the first and best SCI-FI film ever.'Blade Runner,' 'Dark City,' and 'The Fifth Element' would have never been created without the inspiration of Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis.'THE PLOTIn The Year 2054, a so-called 'pre-crime division' is working busily around Washington, DC. It's purpose is to use the precog(native) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. Author, Dashielle, and Agatha (Samantha Morton), whose power is the strongest of the three. When the three precogs, who only work together, floating in what the police call the Temple, have a vision the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time  that it will happen, are given out to these special police who then try to prevent the crime from happening.
Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, 'Minority Report' is about a cop name John Anderton (Tom Cruise). John has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future  murder, and he must investigate the circumstances of this murder and prevent it before it is too late.*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****The film examines the political and ethical  dilemma of arresting a person before the  crime is committed.  The project of pre-crime prevention is having it's first trial run, and the citizens of the city will vote on it in the next election. If  the people vote it in as law  the crime rate will drop drastically, but it is unknown whether innocent people might be imprisoned.
When John's son was murdered he joined the precog division and worked tirelessly to catch and imprison all murderers. One day, his name arrives in the 'perpetrator' chute. The precogs predict that he will kill a man he never knew in less than 36 hours. John flees the division, his own colleagues after him, to solve this situation as his trust in the system diminishes rapidly.  John follows a very small clue  that might hold the key to his innocence, a strange unsolved yet predicted murder and a so-called 'minority report',  which is a documentation of one of the rare events when on of the  precogs sees something different than the other two.THE DIRECTINGThere's a scene that most directors call a two-face-shot but Samantha Morton and Tom Cruise are facing the opposite direction. The two actors chins lay on each other's shoulders, as if almost hugging each other. Then Spielberg takes the camera and places it on the right side of Tom body and captures the two face shot. Tom's face and Samantha's eye's and mouth portray  a very powerful scene. Another shot that I call the 'Taxi Driver' shot is when Spielberg trails the camera on the roof of the peoples apartment, showing the spiders identifying the people. These days that scene would be digital but Spielberg never uses 3D unless he has too. Spielberg directs his films in a new yet classical way.THE ACTORSSamantha Morton's face conveys total fear and total authority. She received an Oscar nomination for her role as the mute girlfriend in Woody Allen's 'Sweet and Lowdown.' Tom Cruise didn't get nominated for his breakthrough performance in 'Vanilla Sky,' shame on the Academy. Tom did receive a Golden Globe for 'Magnolia' and 3 Academy Award nominations for the following films, 'Born on The Forth of July', 'Jerry Maguire' and 'Magnolia.' Collin Farrell delivers his best performance in this movie to date.There is a mental love story portrayed  between Agatha and John. They've both been scarred deeply in the past and fate brings them together at this crucial time in John's life to solve this mystery. The film ends with Agatha sitting in a chair thinking about both her mother and John.FAVORITE SCENEMy favorite scene is when Agatha helps John get away from the cops in the mall. This scene is like a puzzle coming together right before your eyes. She tells him to pick up an umbrella, then they pass a woman who recognizes him from police alerts and Agatha tells him that a man is carrying a briefcase  that has a magazine in it about him.Finally she tell him to stop and wait for the man who is selling balloons in the mall and when he does, the balloons block them both from being seen by the police. When they exit the mall the reason she asked for an umbrella becomes clear. It is raining and when they raise their umbrella they are indistinguishable in a crowd of hundreds of people with umbrellas.BEST ACTION SEQUENCEThe best action sequence is when John takes the police on a rollercoaster ride of evasion in the neighborhood.SCENE WITH A MESSAGE The scene where John almost lost his eyes is a message that he is blind to his emotions and does not see the big picture. The scene is really funny and sick but it does convey this message.In the end I find that Spielberg is still in his Kubrick stage. Spielberg ends the film with a happy ending, but the film is still very dark. I quote Steven from an interview  'I have to tap into my dark side to truly create a dark film.' Believe me he has. I love this movie. Ridley Scott eat your heart out.I haven't found any mistakes in this film and  I definitely recommend this film to movie goers everywhere. I give 'Minority Report' a 15 out of 10.NOTE: Some of my plot paragraph quotes were from the IMDB site.",9,0,0,6 August 2002
Akira," The Best Animated Film ever made
","There aren't enough words to describe this incredible film . The directing is unbelievable; the acting, the soundtrack, and of course the animation is great. One reason why I love this movie, is the message it delivers to the audience. The message is how pathetic we really are, politics, war, riots, we are pathetic creatures. Another reason I like this film is that it's the first animated movie to question our existence. I didn't enjoy 'Ghost In The Shell' as much as 'Akira' because 'Ghost In The Shell' tried to give out that same message, but it the message had been shown in 'Akira.' Don't get me wrong I love 'Ghost in the Shell.' I enjoyed the awesome, advanced 3d visual effects, and lot's it references to the Bible.  Also the story was good but it was to short.  If you see 'Akira' do not see 'Ghost in the Shell' unless you're tempted like I was to see both.  I like films that give a true message through hard hitting action scenes not just through Bible references. Katsuhiro Otomo is a great director and has made a true animated epic.  In fact, forget that it's an animated film; it's one of the greatest films ever made in the last 60 years.I love this film Akiraaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I give this film a 15 out of 10.",10,0,1,18 April 2002
Troy," 'I expected another Ben-Hur, but I get trash'
","Wolfgang Peterson spends 170 million dollars to turn our heros into boring Greek gods.  Brad Pitt(Fight Club) is a great actor, but the demension he tries to ad to his character Achillies, the more he fails. What we don't know is that Achillies was in love with his cousin, and when his cousin dies, Brad show's no emotion, he just wimps.  Orlando Bloom doesn't really do anything, in fact his whole career is not doing anything. In 'Lord Of The Ring' he doesn't do anything, but he showed that he cared for his friends, and the girls loved him. But there is no acting in this movie, just action, action, mindless action, to be honest with you, the real actors are Peter O, Toole and Eric Banner.  But thats not saying much, but Peter does save the film in some odd way.'Troy' has ended up like 'The Alamo', same situation, and with the same outcome, the audience is sick and tired of war films, especially with no accurate details of what happened.  In 'Lawrence Of Arabia', the film is driven by silence, acting and beauty, but then again David Lean was a genius, and Wolfgang Peterson did only one good film(The Perfect Storm).What a dissapointment. *1/2(out of 4 stars).",4,1,3,12 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'Best Picture of the year'
","I've been waiting for this film a long time.  This is the best film of the year.  I had my doubts when I first saw the ending but have since made up my mind that this film is the best of the year.  The directing was  beyond my expectations. I anticipated  lyrical beautiful directing as David Lean did with 'Lawrence of Arabia' but instead Peter Jackson made The Lord Of Rings a cross between 'Gladiator' and 'Saving Private Ryan.'  Elijah Wood did a great job holding his own in this film.I've notice that Ebert and Roeper said the film was too long but it didn't seem too long to me; 2 hours and 58 minutes is not that long if the movie is good.  I've seen almost every movie this year and at first it was a toss-up between  'A Beautiful Mind'  and 'Lord of the Rings'  for best picture  of the year. But I thought about it while longer and I must say that Lord of the Rings is it for me this year. A friend of mine asked me whether Lord of the Rings was better than Star Wars. But there is a  fundamental difference between the two movies. And because 'Star Wars' is a Sci-Fi epic and 'Lord of the Rings' is a fantasy epic, there is no comparison.  I am not about to say that Lord Of The Rings is a better movie than Star Wars. Besides Peter Jackson took this saga from a book and George Lucas created Star Wars on his own.   I have not read the book yet so the ending took me by surprise. Mr. Jackson said he's going by the book to make this film and I've only seen the animated version.  I'm not going to spoil the ending for anyone.I love the film so much I need to say it again 'Lord Of The Rings.'  I recommend this film to anyone. I give it a 15 out of 10.",10,0,0,14 January 2002
Doctor Zhivago," David Lean at his best
","The reason why I think its him at his best is because of the feeling and texture of the movie. It was uncanny but simple. The movie takes place at a time with a young girl and a policemen(Alec Guiness)who is looking for his brothers daughter(which is his niece). After a boring yet interesting scene we go through an odyssey of sadness, beauty and action. But I must warn everybody if they hate narrarating that Alec Guiness is the narrarator of this classic and I find narrarating very annoying because it leaves me thinking that the director was getting desperate and didn't think that the plot was good enough, I mean think about it, did Lawrence of Arabia need narrarating? Did Eyes Wide Shut narrarating? ''NO''. But there are some movies that worked well with narration. The Color Purple, Girl Interrupted, and some of Stanley Kubrick's classics like Dr.StrangeLove, Full Metal Jacket,and Clockwork Orange. Raging Bull, Pulp Fiction,Godfather,And Meanstreets became classics without narraration. But besides all that it was Omar Sherriff's best Movie next to Lawrence of Arabia.The acting was superb and it really was David Leans best film not just because of the directing, because the film's direction was different from Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge to the River Kwai but because the movie wasn't just dark like River Kwai and it wasn't light hearted like Lawrence Of Arabia it was both. I guess David Lean wanted the narraration because he felt like he needed it for this picture to connect it somehow, because everytime I think about it and I feel like no other director can do this film.",9,0,1,11 December 2001
Spider-Man," 'Good,but not great'
","After viewing 'Spider-Man 2', I'd discovered that it was POINTLESS to create the first Spider-Man film. This film has many powerful scenes, the death of Uncle Ben, Spider-Man defeating The Green Goblin, and the final scene when Peter Parker tells Mary Jane that he can't be with her.THE WEEKEND THAT MADE HISTORYIn the summer of 2002 I watched every trailer of 'Spider-Man'. It was a great summer, women, going to high school, but I was afraid that 'Spider-Man' would tank, and people would hate it and it would be the most controversial film ever, why was Sam Raimi directing this film, why was Tobey Maguire playing 'Spider-Man'. This didn't make any sense, Tobey Maguire is a dramatic actor, not an action hero. My cousin and I were thinking this film is going to suck, why didn't James Cameron take a chance to make this film, besides he wanted to write and direct 'Spider-Man' ten years ago. Oh I forgot, he hasn't directed a film in 8 or 7 years, and it still seems that James is still in love with himself, I mean he's achieved everything that he ever wanted to achieve in cinema.Steven Spielberg, now there's a great director, 'The Color Purple', 'Shindler's list', what a director, HE'S Achieved EVERYTHING, and changed cinema forever. But there's A.I., that film wasn't a disappointment, but who can trust Spielberg now, he may kill Spider-Man by probably the third film, who knows. Martin Scorsese, well he would probably put gangster's in 'Spider-Man' and that wouldn't be pretty. My cousin and I were contemplating until we had no choice but to wait and see for ourselves.114 million dollarsI took my mom to Regal Cinemas, and it was a great day, it reminded me of the day I saw 'Jurrasic Park', and 'Titanic', that peaceful silence, I couldn't even speak, I was so nervous that this film would suck. In fact I was begging it to suck, I expected Maguire and Raimi to fail. My mom and I got there three hours before the movie started, the longer we stood there, the more the line got longer and longer, and longer. I saw people that were my age and baby-boomers that had waited for 'Spider-Man' to come to the big screen. I walked in the movie and I was surprised, I was actually happy to see a film, I hadn't felt that way in years. I sat in my seat, the lights got dimmed and the film began.After about 2 hours, I realized this was an incredible film, I said that at the time, but after seeing the sequel, 'Spider-Man' was just an action film, there was no plot, I already knew the story. 'Spider-Man 2' was a crowning achievement, it will set the new generation of superhero films, and now I'm looking forward to 'Batman Begins' cause I want to know more about Batman than any other superhero. 'Spider-Man' made 114 million dollars in three days and it grossed 403 million dollars in its total run. I think the 'Spider-Man' saga will probably end up like 'Harry Potter', the darker the saga gets, the less money the saga makes. Roger Ebert's view of this film was false, this was just the tip of the ice berg, it was setting you up for the epic fights in the sequel and the dramatic scenes that have even surpassed 'Superman', and will change cinema forever. PS: I was wrong about Tobey Maguire, he's gonna be the best Spider-Man until he reaches age 50.I give this film ***1/2(out of 4 stars).",8,0,1,24 August 2004
Pearl Harbor," 'Sucked'
","This was the worst film of 2001 but the DVD is good. Ben Affleck was the worst actor in the film. I give Kate Beckinsale a razzie for her smile. I give Josh Hartnett a razzie for crying. And Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself for turning something Historical into trash. If you want to see something great about Pearl Harbor, go see 'Tora Tora Tora'.I recommend this film to people that ain't got a brain. I give this film a 5 out of 10.",3,0,1,27 May 2002
Legends of the Fall," 'Brad Pitt's Worse Film.'
","The Cinematography is amazing, the story is wholesome, but the acting is hideous.THE PLOTThe plot is a passionate journey into the darkest secrets of love, betrayal and the unbreakable bonds of brotherhood.*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****When I bought this movie I knew I had a jewel in my closet. 48 hours later I realized I'd wasted both my money and my precious two hours on this melodramatic mess of a movie. I'd wasted my time watching a movie where Everyone dies, where there is annoying narration throughout the film, and where  Anthony Hopkins looked indescribably horrid.  And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Brad Pitt was too beautiful early in his career so people doubted his acting ability.  Now Brad is forty years old, his face has more character, and no one doubts his acting ability. Maybe its old age or he's getting some acting lessons, whatever it is, it works.The Cinematography is amazing and reminded me of 'Lawrence Of Arabia.' The incomparable artistry and vision of  David Lean is present in  Edward Zwick's directing. The Academy Awards made a great choice giving `Legends of The Fall' an Oscar for Best Cinematography.
 In the end though I couldn't believe that Edward Zwick directed this film. He directed  'Glory', the Great War epic that earned Denzel Washington an Academy Award. I didn't want to see 'Glory' because the same director of `Legends Of The Fall' directed it, but when I saw 'Glory' on cable I realized I'd made a huge mistake. I had unknowingly bought Zwick's worst movie when I purchased  `Legends Of The Fall.' Trying not to see my psychiatrist, I wondered whether Zwick had gone Hollywood or was cursed with a horrible screenwriter. 
Please don't make the same mistake. My rating is 5 out of 10.Note: Plot description taken from the movie's DVD case.",2,4,11,18 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An audience pleaser, or a work of art
","As we once again incounter our hero's on their quest to destroy the one ring, we find ourselves in a trance with the love of the film. What I mean by love is the wonderful scenes in this film. The beauty, the lust, it reminds me of Lawrence of Arabia in some way. The way Peter Jackson has the sun in the backround when Aragorn,Legolas, and Gimli (Yes I memorized all of their names) run towards it. And the acting, my god, when you talk about dramatic actors, you think of plain old dramas, not fantasy epics. Believe me this film can get dramatic, but is this film is as dramatic as the first one, well no.The first one is way better. The drama, the beginning of it all, the sadness, and there's something about the fight scenes that seem real in some way. The 'Fellowship' focuses on the acting, not action, 'The Two Towers' has useless, mindless action for the audience. Instead of focusing on the Hobbits and what these characters have to go threw to believe that they can destroy evil. What we get is a 45 minute action scene and Gandolf riding down a hill to save his friend. If this film kept the same pace of the first film, then I would give this film four stars. But here it is.I give this film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars.",10,0,0,10 August 2004
Men in Black II," 'I wasted my money again.'
","I didn't like the first one, but the sequel is worse. Will Smith was horrible but Tommy Lee Jones was great. The plot sucked, Rip Torn was terrible, and The directing was... bad. 'Men In Black 2' makes 'Bad Company' look Shakespearean.I recommend this film to MIB freaks. I give this film a 3 out of 10.",3,0,0,8 July 2002
Event Horizon," 'Poor sci fi trash'
","This film came out in 1997 and we wonder why kids shoot each other in schools. This film is overly violent, I had nightmares for weeks, I couldn't even eat. Sorry, I tend to act like Dr. Seuss, when I review a terrible, horrible film. There is no point to this stoy, or having these great actors in this film. Why, Why, WHY DOES PAUL ANDERSON WANT TO DO CHARACTER DRIVEN FILMS. Sorry, I was expecting a milestone in sci fi films, or even a comedy like Andersons greatest achievement 'Alien Vs. Predator', but noooooo. I get crap, I don't mean just any crap, I mean the crap that comes out of your toilet. And I'm not even going to give this film the pleasure of me describing the plot.When were being subjected to this kind of crap, at least tell us why these characters are dying. I got to know more about 'Solaris' than this, then again that film was one of the best films of 2002. 'The Matrix' was almost like this, but they got us to forgive them for putting some action in it. 'Event Horizon' has no action, no plot, or even a reason to horrible violence, and the actors are all on the same level of acting. Once again 'Alien VS. Predator' is his crowning achievement.I give this worthless piece of crap, 1/2*(out of 4 stars).",1,10,22,23 August 2004
Grave of the Fireflies," This Film belongs on any list of the greatest war film ever made
","This is the Greatest anime ever made, this film shows the horror of war and what happen during that time because of our actions. Can the world ever live down world war two, I don't know but I love this film. The beauty, the script, it all works, and it doesn't take cheap shots like most fims.  This is a brilliant masterpiece.THE PLOTIn the aftermath of a world war two bombing, two orphaned children struggle to survive in the Japanese countryside.  To Seita and his four-year-old sister, the helplessness and indifference of their countrymen is even more painful than the enemy raids.  Through desperation, hunger, and grief, these children's lives are as heartbreakingly fragile as their spirit and love is inspiring. Grave Of The Fireflies is a tale of the true tragedy of war and innocence lost, not only of the abandon young, but of an intire nation.This is the greatest anime and one of the best war films of the 20th century. I give this film a 4 out of 4 stars.",10,4,5,10 August 2004
The Insider," 'Russell Crowe's best performance'
","What does an actor need to do to impress an audience, an actor needs to make you cry, make you angry, and especially scared. Russell Crowe(Gladiator) has done all of those things in 'The Insider.' In 'A Beautiful Mind', he shows the obvious sadness, he cries, weeps, and screams, but in 'The Insider' he tries to stay strong while showing his sadness threw the not so obvious ways. Like sitting down in a chair, but good old Michael Mann will show you that he's going mad in some way. Mann shows a scene where he's looking at his children, but his children are not there, he's really looking at a wall.Crowe's Oscar winning performance(Gladiator) is not nearly as good his performance in this film, or even 'A Beautiful Mind', but he brought back the sandle movie saga, and redefined what a Gladiator really is.  He is one of the greatest actors of our time, he deserves to be compared to the all time greats, like Marlon Brando, and Richard Burton, and he needs to be compared to the elites, Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise, Robert De niro, Al Pacino, and Tom Hanks.This film is incredible, and I give it ****(out of 4 stars).",9,1,2,12 August 2004
The Hurricane," The only think that was interesting about this movie was Denzel's acting
","Hurricane was just to stretched out. Norman Jewison's directing was remarkable but stale,good,but has a lot of gaps. After an hour of the movie I thought it was over but it was only getting started and I       thought it needed more fight scenes like maybe six instead of three. The fight scenes were the whole movie to me and they were close to 'Raging Bull'. You would think that the movie starts with the boy and the boxer meeting for the first time but it's right in the middle of the movie. What I'm trying to say is the movie was just to long and too boring for it to actually be a boxing movie.",8,0,2,15 December 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," 'I miss Kubrick'
","'Full Metal Jacket', 'Lolita','A Clockwork Orange', these classics were ahead of there time, now these movies are being hailed as the best of Kubrick's films.  'Eye's Wide Shut' was Kubrick's last film, he took a chance and has made a film that is in it's own class, and has created a dark yet clever film.THE PLOTA doctor (Tom Cruise) who is married to an artist, finds out that she almost cheated on him, then he goes on an odyssey of sex and murder.When I first heard of Stanley Kubrick's latest film, I was expecting a sexual, cinematic film. But then I saw the film, and I was dissapointed with the darkness, the acting, and the orgy scene. Well if that's an orgy, I don't want to be in one. It was scary. I didn't like the film at first, but then I saw it two more times, and I began to think, can sex drive people to murder.2001: A Space Odyssey I looked at all of Kubrick's films before I saw 'Eye's Wide Shut', and I realized that he's the kind of director that show's the dark, inmoral side of human being's,  so I decided this is an instant Kubrick classic. However, Kubrick  does demonstrate hope in some of his films. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is one of the best films of the 20th century.  As I remembered the ending, that showed a man being reborn in space as a baby, it brought tears in my eye's.A CLOCKWORK ORANGEThis is another good film by Kubrick. It's about a man who is a rapist, and a killer. But when he's arrested, they put him through a treatment that will change his whole life. When the treatment is over, one of consequences of it is that he realizes that every time he throws up, he is  thinking of sex with women. He curses, and tries to be violent but it is impossible. The ending shows  that he has  had some redemption, but maybe he didn't really learn anything.FULL METAL JACKETThe action is savage, and this is a superb film. The ensemble cast falls into action in Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War that shows the horrible process that turns people into killers. 'Full Metal Jacket', from its basic training to its nightmare of combat in Hue City, scores a cinematic direct hit.I love 'Eye's Wide Shut.' I give it ****(out of 4 stars)",9,0,1,15 August 2004
Raging Bull," Great but the book is better.
","It's clear that Raging Bull is the greatest boxing movie ever made.The fight scenes are great, the directing is great and so on. But I'm reading and have nearly finished the book Raging Bull and it makes the movie recede in my mind. Don't get me wrong, Scorcese put it together quite nicely, and of course Deniro is intense. The book is better because of the way Lamotta described the fight scenes; the sweat, the noise, the feeling of winning the middle weight championship, and the feeling of going crazy was out standing. I think Scorsese is a visionnary because he shows the cruel world of boxing and what it does to a man and his pride. Plus the chemistry between Pesci and Deniro was electrifying. It is Deniro's best movie and he deserved his Oscar.",10,1,1,12 December 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," 'One of the best films of our time.'
","Lector Quotes: 'People may say were in love.'  Call it what you want, this film is a scary, crazy, sacred love story.  Clarice (Jodie Foster) has a dark past, much like Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) who has a hunger to eat the flesh of human beings. There's a scene when Lector finnaly helps Clarice to let go of her past, and as she's about to walk away he touches her finger. That touch has all of his emotions, love, anger, and the rest is all of the above. But that is what I mean by sacred, its weired but sacred.THE PLOTA vicious psycopath is murdering women throughout the midwest. Believing it takes one to know one, the F.B.I. sends agent Clarice Starling (Foster) to interview a prisoner who may provide clues to the killer's actions. That prisoner is Hannibal Lector (Hopkins), a brilliant, demented cannibal who agrees to help Starling only if she'll feed his morbid curiosity with details of her own complicated life. But as their relationship develops, Starling is forced to confront not only her own hidden demons, but also an evil so powerful that she may not have the strength to stop it.Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster deliver sensational performances, and portray complicated and enigmatic characters. The only film that I remembered scaring me like this was 'Psycho', and thats what we have to compare this film to. 'Psycho', 'The Exorcist' and even the modern thrillers, like 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs.'I love this film, I give it ****(out of 4 stars).",10,2,3,11 August 2004
Vanilla Sky," A cross between A.I and Memento
","A cross between A.I. and Memento. There is one word to say about Vanilla Sky 'SUPERB.' Surprisingly it's  the best role Tom Cruise's has ever done in his career and it's Cameron Crowe at his best. Cameron Crowe gives us a message that will melt your heart in so many ways but I'm not going to spoil it for you because the trailer doesn't tell you anything. The reason that I think it's a cross between A.I. and Memento is because New York seems very futuristic almost like A.I, and it has a very strange twist to it like Memento.Penelope Cruz's role is better than her role in ''Captain Corellis Madolin'' and Kurt Russell is surprisingly good in his role. Cameron Diaz should be known as one of the greatest dramatic actresses in the world. It's a roller coaster all the way and if Russell Crowe gets nominated for an Oscar, I think Tom Cruise will be great competition. Please see it.",9,0,0,14 December 2001
Heat," 'One Of The Best Films of the 90's'
","This is probably Michael Mann's best film. He wants us to care about these two characters, we feel sorry for these characters. Mann directs us into the minds of these killers. Like 'The Insider', the film is about not really ordinary people, but when you look at the world they live in, they seem more ordinary than us. 'Ali', 'Colateral', 'Heat', 'Manhunter', the characters that have to go threw these trials and tribulations, their lives are threaten, their families are even threaten. 'Ali' was not his best film, but you get the same feeling about what he has to go threw to achieve his mission, that's the same feeling you get in 'The Insider' and 'Heat.' The characters are pushed to their limits, to the point of insanity.THE ACTORSAl Pacino does his best over acting ever. He yells, he screams, he cries, he even throws things, but there are times when he is silent and that is him at his best, when he is silent. Robert De niro really doesn't do anything, but here's the tricky part, he's really the whole film, his character is quiet, has hidden rage, he love his work, he is also in love, but like he said, 'I don't really want to do anything else.' That's pretty sad coming from a guy who can't spend the rest of his life with the woman he loves.This film is awesome, a true epic of its time. A masterpiece. Wholly original. I give this film ****(out of 4 stars).",10,0,0,12 August 2004
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," The Best Vampire Movie ever created
","Interview with a Vampire is actually one of the best films of the decade. Brad Pitt probably gave the best performance of his career. Brad showed the pain and the rage of Louis. Tom Cruise was excellent    as the handsome lonely Lestat. Antonio Banderas was scary as Armond. And Kirsten Dunst was great as Claudia, she acted like a woman in a little girls body.This film shows that Vampires aren't blood sucking animals,they have emotions and a soul. Ann Rice puts you in this world and makes you think, what if you could get a Vampire to sit and tell you the story of his life. Neil Jordan's directing was hypnotic and so was the acting. Brad and Tom should have been nominated for an Oscar and I'm glad this film got the Oscar for best original score. I love this movie and I hope it will be seen and loved by many in the future.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Vampire films. I give it a 15 out of 10.",9,1,2,17 May 2002
Gangs of New York," Great film, but not one of Scorsese's best.
","Before I begin my review, I would like to say congratulations Martin Scorcese for adding yet another great film to your long career. This is the kind of film that doesn't hold anything back; the violence, the lifestyles these characters live, and like always Mr. Scorsese leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. What I mean by 'bad taste' is the sinful images that this films evokes. The killing, the prostitution, the revenge are all sinful things.THE PLOT  The film starts in 1846 and ends in 1863 with the draft riots. The setting is New York's five points, the most violent part of the world at the time. The story is risen out of the conflicts between the whit Anglo-Saxon 'natives' and the Irish immigrants coming into the five points. One boy needs to avenge the death of his father.THE ACTORSLeonardo DiCaprio is one of the greatest natural actors that I've seen since Michael Keaton. Natural acting is getting into character but at the same time still being yourself; in other words you're infusing your own personality with the character your assigned to portray in the film.Gary Cooper was a natural and so was Spencer Tracy. Leo's performance in this film is far better than 'Titanic.' In 'Gangs of New York' Leo shows an unending rage that the audience has never seen before, in 'Titanic' he's just a pretty boy. One of the problems with Leo's performance is that his accent comes and goes through out the film, just as Mel Gibson's accent did during 'Braveheart.' Mel wasn't nominated for best actor in 'Braveheart' so I don't think Leo will get nominated for this movie for some of the same reasons, one being accent authenticity. However, I will expect a nomination for him in `Catch Me If You Can.'   Daniel Day-Lewis's gives his best performance since 'My Left Foot.' Daniel has always shown the dark of every character that he's played and he incorporates some kindness and humanity as well in his performances.  I expect an Oscar win for Daniel but Dennis Quaid presents immense competition in his performance in 'Far From Heaven.' Cameron Diaz has been giving terrible performances since 'Any Given Sunday' but with 'Gangs Of New York' she's proved her dramatic ability is still intact and is once again one of my favorite dramatic actresses.
THE PROBLEMSOne of the problems with this film is the first battle scene. Every time Daniel Day-Lewis knifed someone there was no blood present. That's when I understood what Roger Ebert was talking about when he said, 'Scorsese didn't put all of his heart into this film.' I now know what he's talking about because you can tell Martin was not into this story because of his directing.  Usually Scorsese tells the story and keeps the audience interested with his directing. His directing carries all of his films, but in this film he lets the actors carry the film and not his directing. That's not Scorcese's style but that is Spielberg's style, Spielberg puts the camera or trails the camera with the actor and just lets them act; no fancy editing and barely any music. Spielberg's directing style is similar to David Lean's style in many ways. Scorsese is a dynamic director. He puts the camera between the actors; he uses music as he manipulates the scene constantly as he goes.... crazy with the camera. Sometimes he adds various types of lighting to his scenes to describe them, and he always uses slow motion via editing and camera work to go from actor to actor. His work is not static. In some films he uses a single tone to bring you into the scene. In 'Gangs of New York' he forgot why he's famous in the first place. He forgot why people love him as a director and as an artist. In 'Kundun' he changed his style purposely for the film and it was evident because he directs 'Kundun' the way David Lean would direct 'Kundun' using a similar style, and I expected that. I believe he directed 'Kunden' the way he visualized it and the film worked. I felt no emotion when he is directing of 'Gangs of New York', because the emotion for the entirety of the film is carried by the actors. I was disappointed this by this movie for those reason I listed. My message to Scorsese is stick to what you know best and what you do best.... better than any other director. Scorsese did remember the fireworks. In every film of Scorsese there are fireworks.I may be sounding negative about this very good film but  I liked it, so I rate 'Gangs of New York' a 9 out of 10.",8,0,0,12 January 2003
Goodfellas," 'The Best Mob film ever'
","This is the best mob film ever.  Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances.  Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as  he does in every other Scorsese film.  New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about. In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it.
Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas?  'I say Yes.'  There are three reason's why I think this is true.  1. The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end.  2. The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same subject but with  different stories. I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the murder scenes in  The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did happen.  I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather. Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's. Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person.  Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas. To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending like Blow. He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy. Scorsese did this film his way, the Martin Scorsese way.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Scorsese fan.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,13 January 2002
The Godfather," 'One of the Best Films of the Decade.'
","The 'Godfather' is Frances Ford Coppola's best film. Marlon Brando gives the most memorable performance in film history as Vito Corleone. The Movie is based on the gripping and compulsive book, The Godfather. Al Pacino gives a legendary performances as Michael Corleone.The beginning is set late in the summer of 1945. The films roots, however, are set in the gangster films of the early thirties. The plot is about rival gangs murdering each other, and now we see the inbred corrupt system of loyalty and terror, in which killing is a preferred way of dealing with the competition. We see how the gangs encroach on each other and why this form of illegal business inevitably erupts in violence. We see their subculture, based on a split between the men's conception of their responsibilities, which they keep dark form there families, and the false world the create to shelter the women and children.The visual scheme is based on the most obvious life and death contrasts, the men meet and conduct their business in deep toned, shuttered rooms, lighted by lamps even in the daytime, and the story moves back and forth between this hidden, world and the sunshine that they share with the woman and children. The tension is in the meetings  held in the underworld darkness and one gets the feeling that this secret life has its own poetry of fear. The dark and light contrast is so operatic and so openly symbolic that it perfectly expresses the basic nature of the material. Noting the Catholic background of the characters and the eternal battle of good and evil, of innocence versus knowledge, knowledge in this instance equates with shame nd guilt. BRANDOThe enormous cast is lead by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the 'Godfather' of a powerful Sicilian - American clan, with James Caan as his hothead son, sonny, and Al Pacino as the thoughtful, educated son, Micheal. Is Brando marvelous? Yes, he is, but then he often is, he was marvelous a few years ago in 'On The Waterfront.' He's shockingly effective in a current film, the 'Score.' The role of Don Corleone, a patriarch in his early sixties, allows him to release more of the gentleness that was so seductive and unsettling. Don Vito could be played as a magnificent old warrior, a noble killer, a handsome bull, but Brando manages to humanize him. Brando internalizes Don Vito's power, makes him less physically threatening and deeper, hidden within himself.THE CAST However, Brando isn't the whole show; James Caan is very fine actor , and so are Robert Duvall and many others in lesser roles. Don sons suggest different aspects of Brando, Caan's Sonny looks like the muscular young Brando, while his heir, Michael, and Al Pacino comes to resemble him in manner and voice. Like Brando in this film, Pacino is simple, you don't catch him acting, yet he manages to change from a small, fresh-faced, darkly handsome college boy into an underworld lord, becoming more intense, smaller, and more isolated at every step. Coppola doesn't stess the father and son links, they are simply there for us to notice when we will. In the end of the 'Godfather' nothing is resolved, because the family business goes on. Terry Malloy didn't clean up the docks at the end of 'On The Waterfront', that was a lie. The 'Godfather' is popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism.I don't have to recommend this film. I give it a 15 out of 10.",10,0,1,23 June 2002
