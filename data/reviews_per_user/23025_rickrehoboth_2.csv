Black Swan," Just terrific in every way.
","Seeing this several weeks after word of mouth, my expectations were high. Wrong, everything about this film is just spellbinding. The casting is superb. Mila Kunis is a discovery and Portman, Ryder, Hershey, and Cassell are perfection. I believed every scene and character, even the descents into obsessions. Neither horror nor chick-flick. That rare movie that cries 'leave the kids at home' for your personal experience. Skip Angelina Jolie and Justin Beiber. Film art and substance are available for adults this season.The blending and meeting of reality and fantasy are cleverly crafted. The movie builds without a lot of exclamation points, to an exciting treatise on the sacrifices one must make to be perfect or as near as we can get. All the plot piece come together to a finish that is thorough, believable, and cautionary.",10,0,1,23 February 2011
Burlesque," Even the guys liked it
","Went with friends, expecting nothing, but came out of the theater wishing I could replay it immediately. I even sat through the lengthy credits. The story moves FAST. Its country girl goes to L A - BUT the plot is not tired at the breakneck speed of the music and fabulous editing. It is visually stunning and visually interesting. The club set is a masterpiece with lighting highlighting the dance routines. For its genre this movie is a prize. And p.s., Christina Aguilera hit every song out of the ballpark as Cher did with the title song. Plus you get Stanley Tucci. The down side - Cher has a second number that is clearly stuck in there to give her a second number. I thought it the weakest song in the movie. The movie is PG 13. I think that is a fair guideline.Lastly, the CD contains only 10 of the vocals.",9,0,0,13 December 2010
