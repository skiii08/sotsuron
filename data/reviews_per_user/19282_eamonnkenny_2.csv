Blade Runner 2049," This is a true masterpiece
","I loved Harrison Ford in movies until he played old man Indy and then I became quite ageist (I'm getting on myself...). I just thought he waited too long to make the movie and then was very skeptical going into to watch Blade Runner 2049 given the recent star wars fiasco. I was so pleasantly surprised.This film has an amazing number of twists that you could never guess. It is a masterpiece. Its slow moving like the original (interestingly the original looks so dated now, and isn't actually that great). You almost want to say as you are watching this movie, 'This is making me bored', but you can't bring yourself to say that. Its just so well paced that it makes for compulsive watching.It dark and moody and yet light and fluffy in some parts. The A.I. ideas where quite interesting and as a technologist I found them particularly intriguing. The look of the movie is so close to the original, but the effects are flawless. Some of the best visual effects since Oblivion.I thought La La Land was the biggest lot of tripe and deserved no oscars, and was concerned about the fact that Ryan Gosling might be poor in the part, but he was absolutely amazing. He pulled off not being quite human but as the movie progresses he becomes more and more human.This movie has one of the greatest cinematic bad guys of all time in my opinion. The voice change of the baddy in some scenes is quite startling and unnerving. They definitely should have received a nomination for their work. Don't want to reveal any more than that. Not giving any spoilers away. Just to say, I'm not talking about Wallace.Even my 16 year old son loved it, which is interesting, given that he turned Blade Runner off after 40 minutes. He found the original so boring and dated. This sequel is definitely worth a watch. And then you have to watch it again to catch the bits you missed the first time.Using my own statistical rule of 'little amount of advertisement = quality movie', or 'too much advertisement on side of bus=flop', I have to say, I didn't see any adverts for this movie at all. This is a movie that needs no introduction or overselling. Its a movie that will be noticed over time for the great movie that it is.Definitely up there with Interstellar, Inception, Oblivion, Empire (V) as my favourite sci-fi's of all time.",10,4,13,17 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Who directed this? It was a mess.
","First off I have to say I love Marvel movies. I'm a huge fan since Iron Man's release. I even love Iron Man 2 which a lot of people didn't like and Civil War is so under rated. The appearance of the Black Panther just brought the whole franchise to a new level. But what happened after that. Black Panther was lauded as a ground breaking masterpiece. Why? Its poor. Serkis and Boseman were not allowed act. They were very flat. The great part Boseman had as the Black Panther was obliterated. And then Michael B. Jordan was amazing. One of the best bad guys with a great origins story. All sorts of oscar nominations ensued for the wrong things. Some sort of messed up Hollywood, 'we want to be PC sensitive rubbish'. Michael B. Jordan didn't even get the nod. What's this all about...? (back to the movie now at hand...)Then came Instagram and 100s upon 1000s of clips of Captain Marvel. Aw Oh!!!! The quality of a film is inversely proportional to the amount of advertisement. See how 'The Amazing Spider-man 2' trailers appeared everywhere. Then Brie Larson appears everywhere. This was a warning of what was to come.The most powerful character in the Marvel Universe, 'what a rush!?'. No, we start by telling us that she is working with the Kree. Hello, who directed this. You just ruined the whole movie in the first 5 minutes. Who can be this stupid? I was there after the first half hour bewildering, thinking, nobody could be this dumb. It like having telling us that Darth Vader had the surname Skywalker in A New Hope.Then Samuel L. Jackson, probably one of the greatest actors of our time is given cringy dialogue. How do I know its cringy? My 15 year old daughter and 16 year old son are coming out of the movie saying that was so cringy. It was like Tom Cruise saying Shannon in Far and Away, I kid you not. Basically even Jackson couldn't recover this rubbish. Brie Larson who is usually great in movies was wooden. How? How could this happen?First of all, the film should have had post editing to remove all mention of the Kree. Also, the battle scenes, lets not start with these? No suspense, no vulnerability, which is kind of what you expect from the most powerful being in the Marvel universe, but the story writers not allow her discover her powers. Then the laughter, what laughter? The jokes weren't funny or well delivered. It was appallingly bad.If you look at the rating I give for sci-fi movies you will see that I mainly give most movies 8-9/10, but this movie is 4/10 at a push. Obviously, it couldn't be salvaged using post-editing and hence why the crazy advertisement campaign ensued. Thankfully Endgame is not being advertised as much which points to possibly a much better attempt at a movie.Okay, this is were I now go to the internet and look up the directors name to see if it was somebody like 'Rian Johnson' who destroyed Star Wars. Whoever directed this movie almost destroyed the great faith I have in Disney and Marvel... Anna Boden, who is she. Never heard of her. And her movies... Wikipedia... lets see... No, don't know these movies. What is going on here. How could this be allowed. Was she a huge Marvel buff as a kid like James Gunn. Maybe she is a feminist and we need a strong female role. No! Weak, weak, weak. This was amateur night with a glitzy stage backdrop at best. Please learn from this fiasco Marvel. We want more fantastic movies with great backstories, great direction and great acting.",4,4,6,17 March 2019
