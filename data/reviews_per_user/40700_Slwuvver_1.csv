First Man," Good movie, if you don't have high expectations
","Personally, I never thought that a movie based on the life of Neil Amstrong would intrest me and pull me in this much as First Man did. At first the film seemed slow, but its needed and it makes the movie better in the end.Good acting, great visuals (however at one point I was kind of annoyed with the shaky cam), good original score.Respect for the director and his team after his previous successes for still doing his own thing and for creating an original and beautiful film.",8,0,1,15 March 2019
