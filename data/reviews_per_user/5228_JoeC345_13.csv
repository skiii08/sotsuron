The King's Speech," Reminds me why I go to the movies.
","I grew up with my Dad showing me old Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant movies. I remember when movies relied on dialogue and acting and not special effects that end up showing us the same explosions over and over again. Now don't get me wrong I enjoy some of those movies because they can be fun. However watching if I had the choice I'd always choose a movie like this because it's filmmaking at it's best, a film that shows who's who among actors today.Now if your a history buff you might know the story behind this. It's about The Duke of York and his stutter which made it hard for him to give speeches. Seems simple enough doesn't it? But there is so much more to the plot that I won't get into since I don't want to ruin the plot for you. I'll just say if you know your history none of this will be much of a shock to you.Movies today forget some of the reasons we go to the movies, firstly let me say I love movies like Sin City and Kill Bill and even movies like Scream and Last House on the Left (1972 version). But when some of these movies think more graphic and more depraved is what we're looking for I think there starting to lose touch with the audience.Now back to 'The King's Speech' the performances are what made this movie shine above others. Geoffrey Rush's role is pitch perfect and it's one of those times where you can't see anyone else in that part. Colin Firth proves that he's among the great actors in this role. Especially after his role in 'A Single Man'.Up to this point I haven't really talked about this movie but if your reading this just believe me it's worth it. I usually try to avoid discussing plot points since most people already have a good idea what the plot is.This is one of the best movies of the year.",10,1,2,20 February 2011
Sucker Punch," I don't understand the hatred of this movie
","When I go to see a movie I usually avoid reading any reviews beforehand. So after I left the theater I couldn't believe how low this movie was scoring on some of these 'well respected' critics sites. As a fan of most films I've come to understand that critics tend to either love a movie like this or hate it but it seems that it was mostly hatred that I was seeing. To me this film was a great original idea that you have to see more then once to completely enjoy this great piece or work that Zach Snyder has made.When a movie can stick everything from samurai's, nazi zombies, dragons and more into a plot then it has already accomplished something. However beyond the CGI that is mostly back round to the plot. The plot is a little complicated but that's a good thing since it makes you think.One of the great things about this movie is that it keeps you guessing and doesn't give up until the credits start rolling. The performances from this young cast is spectacular, Emily Browning's role in particular is more difficult then it seems but she accomplishes it in a great way.I don't understand why this movie was so denounced by critics and I don't really care to tell you the truth because it's viewers like you and me that know what we like to watch and what kind movies are entertaining. This movie will end up like other movies in the past like Donnie Darko and others that became cult classics.",10,12,24,29 June 2011
In Bruges," Great Movie
","I know it's been awhile since this came out I actually still remember the first time I saw this. I was at my buddies house and we're doing a movie day we had already watched 'Funny Games' and 'Diary of the Dead' but I really didn't think when we put this in it would be as great as it was.Colin Farrell who I've been a fan of since 'Hart's War' shows that he is a great actor in this movie. In the first maybe half of the movie it's a very dark comedic movie that I thoroughly enjoy but when it finally gets to the serious plot points it doesn't disappoint. Brendan Gleeson along with Colin Farrell make a great duo. With Gleeson's love of old buildings and tourism and Farrell's pouting and only wanting to go get drunk at the local pub.With all the quick side stories and adventures I won't waste my time trying to explain some of them and it would also decrease from the pleasure of finding out for yourself. Movies like this are rare nowadays it seems, a movie with slapstick comedy, bloody violence, and soul.Let's not forget Ralph Fiennes role, you almost want to say he went over the top but he doesn't it's almost pitch perfect for the role, I smiled whenever he was on screen, I've said before that previews are ruining movies lately by giving away to much plot but even if you think that's true with this one, trust me your wrong there is so much more to the movie then what's shown in the preview.So in conclusion I've tried to not give away any of the plot because this is one of the movies that you should know almost nothing about going in and let the movie take you for a enjoyable ride. Trust me when the credits start rolling you'll be glad you spend your time watching this one.",10,1,3,12 December 2010
Mississippi Burning," Blind Hatred
","A little after the half way point in this film a main character is describing how how hatred is taught and that the after hearing something numerous times you stop questioning it.This film is one of the best films I have ever seen. I first watched it in my 8th grade history class which is almost 10 years ago now. The thing that struck me the most was how no one person was actually 'evil' but when a group of people get together it's a different story.The atmosphere is genius, the layout of the town looks vivid and alive. Unlike some movies with only two or three dedicated sets this one literally is the town. The people of the town seem pitch perfect for their roles, from the F.B.I. agents to the town Sheriff to everyone else. While I'm on the topic of characters I want to say how much I appreciated the fact that they, in one way or another, developed most of the people you meet by showing where they work, live, and give them personality.Now to discuss a little bit of the tone of the film. First off I never completely understood racism. The hatred of a group of people for any reason never made sense to me. As I said in the start of this review when something is taught to you, you don't think to question it. The only conclusion I can come to is that it's relying on blind hatred of some offense you think happened or were told happened. If that little bit didn't make sense racism doesn't make sense to me.The little things that are present here is what makes it a great film especially since none of the character development is done for the sake of the plot but for the sake of the character.Both Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are great actors and are amazing in there roles but between the two Hackman has a more subtle way about the way he investigates a case unlike Dafoe who always thinks more agents and equipment is better then Hackman's method of talking pleasantly to people to get the truth without the town turning on him.I could go on and on about this movie and the more I want to write the more I know the longer this is the less it'll be read. So I'll leave you with this, there are very few movies that leave you with a lasting impression and this is one that'll I'll be watching again and again.",10,0,1,29 January 2011
The Town," Great Crime Drama
","It's true Ben Affleck has been in some rather bad movies(cough 'Reindeer Games') but really his record is definitely over .500 from 'Good Will Hunting' to 'The Sum of All Fears' and the underrated 'Changing Lanes'. He's been the butt of a lot of jokes but when it comes to his directorial debut 'Gone Baby Gone' and this one 'The Town' no ones laughing. The one thing that shocked me was the real suspense I felt during the movie. One thing directors are doing now that is ruining this is making the audience omniscient. Giving us all the views so we know whats coming around every corner. Here we're left in the dark to guess what's going on just as the characters are wondering what's going on.A movie like this rely's heavily on the actors and some you'll recognize from 'Gone Baby Gone'. Jeremy Renner who most of you will remember from last year's 'Hurt Locker' however is your looking for a reprise of that role stop and look for something else. Here he's playing a thug and thief and he does it masterfully. The rest of MacRay's crew is effective in there roles from Slaine as the driver to Blake Lively as Coughlin's drugged out sister with a daughter and no idea who the father is. Also Jon Hamm as the F.B.I. agent Frawley is good even though he seems like the villain in all this you have to remember the heroes of this movie are criminals, that is all I'll say on that subject.One side note that I've been finding more and more interesting lately is that when people walk out a theatre playing a movie like this there is always one or two people saying 'they didn't need all that bad language' my first thought is, well when your in a shoot out or running from the cops your not thinking 'oh shoot I really hope I get away'. So be warned if language or violence offends you stay clear of this one or really any crime movie of this sort.If your still reading then this is your sort of movie and you will not be disappointed I enjoyed every minute of it and was actually on the edge of my seat for part of it. I try to while until I write a review on any movie so I'm not still in awe of the initial viewing. So as I have viewed 'The Town' again I'm reminded how much I was enjoyed this movie and how it will probably rank up with the greats like 'Heat'.I'm actually excited to see what Ben Affleck does next, whereas some could argue 'Gone Baby Gone' was a fluke, I can't see anyone saying it now after this one.",10,0,1,25 December 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," Full bodied comic book movie.
","Captain America joins the list of great comic book movies. It has been fascinating to watch Marvel bring these characters to the screen from Iron Man and now to Captain America. I'm going to admit when I first heard that Chris Evans was going to be portraying Steve Rogers I was a little worried and even after the first couple previews I didn't know what to expect. I was 100% wrong, he was a great choice for this role.Hugo Weaving as Red Skull was an obvious choice and worked out perfectly, Weaving has a knack for giving off a sinister demeanor. Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors and has his role as an Army Colonel is amazing. In most movies I've seen with him he has a personality of commanding authority so to choose him as a Colonel seems like a right choice.Now to the plot of the movie. Steve Rogers is a skinny weakling who really wants to join the Army and go to Europe to serve his country. Unfortunately he keeps getting denied enlistment. Until his fifth try, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) gives him a chance in a new unit that is trying to find a subject for an experimental procedure.After this he's a public figure for a while until he can no longer sit on the side lines and does what he was meant to do.Since I do not want to spoil this wonderful movie experience for you I am going to stop there. However I will say this, I was very pleased that, like with Iron Man, these movies are taking there time to give a good back round for these characters instead of just plunging right into the action incoherently.This is a great movie, I have no doubt about it. I would recommend this to anyone, even if you are not a comic book fan. This is one of the rare ones where you don't have to be, you can just sit back and enjoy this movie.",6,1,14,22 July 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Evolution gone awry.
",Going into 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' I wasn't sure really what was going to happen which in this day and age of movies is rare. To be clear I knew how it was going to start and finish but the way it got to the conclusion I was surprised how it got there. I enjoyed watching the plot unfold in front of me and was glad to see the makers of this film didn't really take any short cuts involving the growth of Caesar the ape that the movie revolves around.It starts with Will Rodman (James Franco) testing his cure to Alzheimer's Disease. He has been testing on chimpanzees to see the effects it has on the brain and if any unknown side effects occur. Here is where I started to see that this film wasn't going to take any short cuts since it took the time to give a brief explanation of what was going on with the apes when they were given the drug.Then something happens that I will not reveal even though the explanation behind it is excellent. After all this Will takes home Caesar and raises him to find out what the drug that he's been testing is really capable of. The evolution of Caesar if terrific and actually takes the time needed for it to be believable that he is actually capable of the things he can do.However there were moments where it seemed the film makers were trying to do to much. Also it failed to give any sort of reason for why humans reacted so differently to treatment.Beyond that 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a good entertainment and worth a view.,Null,0,2,13 August 2011
Rango," What an animated feature should be.
","I grew up watching old cartoons like Rocky and Bullwinkle, and one thing I've noticed with animated features in recent years is that they seem to think children are stupid and can't handle real plot lines. So to see something like this is like watching a miracle. This is a movie that both parents and children can enjoy thoroughly. It gives the children a great animated feature to enjoy that the adults can enjoy as well, however also it has many references to old westerns and other movies like 'Wizard of Oz'.The plot is that a lizard finds his way to a village in the desert called 'Dirt', which is probably called that because that's all they seem to have. The main problem is that they are running short on water and for some reason the town well has completely dried up. The lizard who calls himself Rango after he gets into town is given the job of sheriff rather quickly after an incident in the local saloon. From there I will not give away any more of the plot because it should be enjoyed.The actors who voice these characters are great from the lead role voiced by Johnny Depp to the little girl voiced by Abigail Breslin. Stephen Root who voices a couple characters is one of my favorites. Then there's The Spirit of the West (if you've seen a couple westerns you'll know who this character is suppose to represent) voiced by Timothy Olyphant.Gore Verbinski who is known for the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies and here he seems to know his westerns through and through.The movie joins other films like 'Nightmare Before Christmas' and more recently 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' as a film that is great for kids and can be even more entertaining for adults.",Null,0,1,17 July 2011
Centurion," Despite it's faults it's entertaining
","Well 20 minutes into this movie I had no idea if I wanted to turn it off or keep watching, I went with the latter of the two and don't regret it. Michael Fassbender who I first noticed in the movie '300' does a great job with his role and is probably the best part of the movie. The faults within the movie has nothing to do with the acting or even the directing it's more about the screenplay, it almost seemed to simple for this type of movie.I'm a sucker for good action scenes even when most nowadays are ridiculous and completely unbelievable and it's easy to notice here that Neil Marshall focused more on the action then the storyline. Now don't get me wrong I was a fan of 'Dog Soldiers' and thought 'The Descent' was one of the best movies of the year. However it seems here that he just wanted to make a bloody action movie. The thing that makes a movie like 'Kingdom of Heaven' or 'Spartacus' a great movie is not putting the action ahead of the story or characters. Honestly part of the way through I kind of forgot that this is suppose to be a historical drama.Don't take this the wrong way I enjoyed what I saw I like action movies, I just don't like a movie trying to be something it's not. This movie is a good action movie and perhaps the Roman backdrop was a good idea, I haven't completely decided yet.It's up to you though what you think and if this is your type of movie. I was in Chicago when Neil Marshall was promoting this movie and got to sit in on a Q&A with him at a convention. It seemed he did a lot of research and knew what he was talking about in regards to Roman history and the occupation of Britain. So maybe I missed something.",7,2,5,12 December 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Perfection
","After viewing this film last night the thing that surprised me the most was how much it resonated with me after I left the theatre. Christopher Nolan has done the impossible and created a legend out a superhero movie. The depths that this film goes into resolving around evil in the darkest definition of the word and the will of a few to oppose such men is astounding.Throughout this epic of a film new characters have been introduced, these characters range from a young policeman to a well trained thief to a new female interest for Wayne. All of the additions in their own way add to the film flawlessly without distracting away from the main plot.Now for the main new addition of Bane. After the introduction of Heath Ledger as the Joker in The Dark Knight I had little hope that any actor could pick up the mantle and be the primary villain in the final chapter of these films but low and behold Tom Hardy does a fantastic job. The atrocities that he enacts with a cruel and logical sense are a little more then disturbing.Christian Bale who from Batman Begins in 2005 to the conclusion of this film has possibly had the best portrayal of Batman. It's more then just what he does, it's also what he doesn't do that shows the nature of Batman. Just notice during the beginning of the film where you can tell that the choices and decisions of the last film look like they are literally weighing on his shoulders. Also Michael Caine has a tougher role in this one then in the two previous films and he does it beautifully. This is possibly the best aspect of this movie. There is absolutely no easy answers to anything that happens, and nothing is done for effect. Their is obviously chase scenes and other such common action movie scenes, but the difference here is that during this film these scenes don't seem unnecessary and don't drag on and on.Christopher Nolan has created his masterpiece which is The Dark Knight saga, the screenplay along with his direction has turned a superhero movie into a classical tragedy with philosophical undertones that can discuss the human condition and the lengths people are willing to go to protect what they cherish. There is so much more that I would like to write but I refuse to give away any spoilers and ruin the movie for anyone.",10,5,11,21 July 2012
Heat," More than a crime drama
","There are rare occurrences that elevate a director, into a great director. This can be seen in 'Taxi Driver' by Martin Scorsese, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' by Steven Spielberg and 'Magnolia' by Paul Thomas Anderson. These are movies in which people begin to realize the true talent that these directors have in making their films.Watching 'Heat' for the first time years ago it was obvious that this film had more then what you would expect from a crime drama, but it's only after a couple viewing that you can begin to really appreciate what this movie has to offer. Which is the experience of watching the world that cops and robbers live in.When this was first released it was promoted strongly on the fact that it was going to be the first movie where Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro were going to share screen time (I'm aware they were in Godfather Part II together but they didn't have any scenes together in that). After all the promotion of this some people were disappointed to have to wait for more then have the movie for them to have a scene together, but honestly I preferred it the way it is. There are far to many movies that have cops and robbers sharing numerous scenes together and after so many it's just hard to believe that it's real. In this they share a couple scenes and only one real conversation which is perhaps the best scene of the movie.The plot of the movie is something that you've heard before, where the movie flourishes and excels beyond the commonality of these sorts of movies is in the dialogue and emotional input that is put into each scene. There is really no scene that seems 'scripted' or 'fake'. There are certain points in the movie where DeNiro pauses for a moment as if he's trying to think of what to say in that situation instead of just regurgitating what the screenplay tells him to say. This is one of those extremely rare films where you can literally see no one else in any of the roles that are cast, it's easy to tell that they went into real casting calls and picked the best person for each and every role.Even with all the beautiful dialogue and conversations that go on throughout the film, I have always been and will always be a fan of the silent parts where we all know what's going on and the director has enough faith in the audience not to insult our intelligence by dumbing down any of these parts at all. There is one particular scene between Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene Shiherlis (Ashley Judd) that is perhaps of the best examples of this. Instead of words there is music in the back round of this scene that gives away the emotional feelings that are occurring during this scene. There is another scene involving Lt. Vincent Hanna's (Al Pacino) stepdaughter (Natalie Portman) that is along the same lines and is another one of those unforgettable scenes that lesser movies would not even bother to incorporate.There is everything right about this movie, there have been movies which after a couple viewings they begin to lose their enjoyment. This is not one of those, this is one of the rare movies that will end up being a classic crime drama along the same lines as 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'Key Largo'.It's hard these days to find anything with the same kind of impact as the older crime dramas but that just might have to do with the less and less attention that writers are giving to the characters in these sorts of movies since their target audience it seems doesn't want to be intrigued by complex plot points, they just want to see stuff blow up and cars chasing each other around the block for half an hour. However when a movie like this comes along it's hard not to appreciate it's courage in taking a kind of movie like this and elevating it to greatness.'Heat' is Michael Mann's masterpiece.",10,1,3,31 January 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," New Cult Classic.
","Every once in a while a movie catches your eye and instantly becomes a cult classic, this has happened with other films such as Donnie Darko, Evil Dead and Reservoir Dogs. Seeing the previews for this film I went in expecting an entertaining horror movie and nothing more. And briefly that's what I thought was be presented before me in the theatre then the real story started to come to light and I couldn't have been more thrilled.Since I refuse to give anything away that would ruin the excellent experience of viewing this movie, I will just briefly describe the plot. If you have ever seen any classic horror films like Evil Dead then you already know the setup to the movie. A few college kids go to a deserted cabin in the woods that they inexplicably were able to get for a weekend or so. Explaining any further about the beginning would just be unnecessary repetition of what you should already know. Needless to say after brief enjoyment some evil is unearthed and one by one the kids start to be killed as would happen in any horror movie of this sort. Up to this point I considered this to be the highlight of the movie which would have been been what I expected but what I didn't expect is that this was barely the beginning of what was coming.Joss Whedon who I have respected for years from his amazing television shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and more recently Dollhouse. He also was pitch perfect for directing the Avengers movie that was also released this year. Him along with his long time collaborator Drew Goddard have made a masterpiece of a horror film, if this film even belongs to a specific genre. The young cast is amazing but perhaps the standout of the group would be Fran Kranz who plays 'Marty', who beyond being the funny stoner of the movie actually does have a really good role and it would seem hard to imagine the movie without him.Unfortunately it's hard to recommend this movie without giving away important plot points, so I'll just end with this, Try and find a way to watch this movie it is spectacular and will become a cult classic that will discussed for a long time.",10,4,10,4 July 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Just a good fun movie.
","Here's the thing, you don't go into a movie like this expecting to see 'The Kings Speech' because you will be horribly disappointed if you set that kind of standard for a summer blockbuster movie. It recent years I have stop reading a lot of critics because it seems they have forgotten sometimes you just need to not analyze so much and just sit back and enjoy the show.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third movie installment in this franchise and surprisingly, almost as good as the first one. After 'Revenge of the Fallen' it seemed this franchise was doomed, and I didn't want to see this one at first but a few buddies informed me it was actually good, so I decided to give it a chance.A half hour in or so it seemed this movie wasn't going anywhere and the plot seemed as thin as before but then it all starts up. To say this is an action movie is almost an understatement, since during the last hour or so it's hard to find a scene where something is not blowing up or crashing or being shot at. However contrary to what other critics have said it wasn't an insult to the ears.The plot that can be a little hard to follow at times with all the mindless violence, but it doesn't really matter it's not that complicated. Even though I will say this time the plot is far more fun to watch and easier to understand then the convoluted 'Revenge of the Fallen'.I would like to talk about the acting in this movie but there really isn't any. It's hard to act while literally everything is blowing up around you and people just keep yelling things. There are some nice one-liners though.As a director Michael Bay is known for mindless action movies and sometimes he fails and sometimes as with this one he succeeds. Some of the statements above may seem to be denouncing this film but there really not, since like I said at the beginning you just have to sit back and enjoy the show.Side note: I've seen 3 movies in the last couple weeks which is more movies that I've seen in theaters in months. 2 of which I saw in 3D (Captain America and the last Harry Potter movie). I didn't feel like spending the extra money to see this in 3D and I think I made the wise choice. The Colors seemed brighter and even thought this is the lesser of the 3 movies I would almost want to say I had a better experience in this one.",Null,0,2,25 July 2011
