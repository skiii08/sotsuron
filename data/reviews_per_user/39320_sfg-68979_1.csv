Howl's Moving Castle," One of my favorite Miyazaki films.
","I always loved this film. I've read the book series, but I liked the spin Miyazaki put on a lot of things.
For example the Castle. It has legs all of a sudden! It feels more like a living being in this than in the books.A big difference from the books is that he definitely removed some of the worse qualities in a lot of characters, but still kept them very interesting and true to their core.The score is amazing. Joe Hisaishi is a God.I've watched the movie in three different dubs (Danish, English and Japanese). They were all good. Lars Mikkelsen did a great job in the Danish one, I just want to point out!If you loved this movie, give the book series a shot. You get to see more about Howl and his origins as well as what happens after he gets his heart back.",9,1,1,21 December 2019
