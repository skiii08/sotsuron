Casablanca," A must See
","Casablanca is a classic 1940'S film. Released in 1942 the story of the film takes place during World War II. A film with drama mixed with a twist of romance in it. The movie is fast paced. There seem to always many things going on. If you like music you will like this film. The film is packed with tons of music and song. I really was amazed on how well the film is directed. There are many scenes involving many people doing different things. For example one group of people is watching the band play, while at the same time they are other actor doing something. The film has such a realism feel to it. When watching viewers feel as if there are present in the night club. The camera movement is so smooth and well filmed. The lighting is amazing. The film couldn't have chosen a better cast. A must see.",Null,0,1,7 March 2010
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
",In 1941 the film Citizen Kane was released. A Black and white film that worth seeing. I really enjoyed this film. The cinematography of the film is outstanding. The use of lighting the many scenes was amazing. What I really like about this film was the narrative structure of the film. I found it to be different than the usually straight forward narrative used by most films. The film begins with the death of old man Kane. Before he passes on he mumbles the words Rosebud. The film becomes center upon the meaning of this word for Kane. I like how viewers are giving incite to Kane's life though a series of flashbacks of his life. I like how the story of his life is told after his death. It leaves little confusion to the viewers. When the films finish then we begin to understand the real Kane. If you want to see a film that uses incredible camera work I would highly recommend Citizen Kane.,Null,0,1,5 March 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," awesome film
","The film Grape of Wrath was shot in 1940. It is a film based off the novel by writer John Steinbeck. Right away just from knowing what the film was based off of. I'm a fan of John Stinebeck other works. So naturally I was excited to see this film. The film takes place during the great depression which was a time of hardship with little employment. This is a story of a family and friend's journey from Oklahoma to California in search of work and a new way of life. Watching the film I felt sad, seeing the condition due to the depression. The film gave views great insight to life during the depression, and the hardship faced by the people who had to live and make through it. How the conditions were so bad at this time that this group of people had to leave their homes, for one evening violating parole, to find a place when they could work and survive. I also was sad because of the misfortunes of the group traveling. The grape of wrath is a film that has great actors who play their parts well. They are believable. This is a film of realism. It's done so well that it's not only believable the viewers could see this film as an actual even that occur during that time in history. As far as the quality of the film's production go. It's fantastic. The scenes are admiral. Lighting is perfect. And the cast is exceptional.",Null,0,1,19 February 2010
Fargo," Loved it
","This was my first Coen brothers experience and I love it. The film begins with a screen with writing on it and it says that this film is base on a true story but to find out it's not. After seeing you would believe it. The film delivers a lot a verisimilitude and does it well. I appreciated the editing techniques used. When some scene changed the screen turns to black and for a few second stays black. My favorite technique was when Carl (Steve Buscemi) is beating the TV trying to make it work. Then the camera zooms in and the TV is working properly but when the camera zooms out, its present in the room of Maggie and her husband. I really got I kick out of the cops in the film. The way Maggie and Lou interact when investigation the first murder scenes with the cop and the witnesses is comical. They take a serious situation and make it kind of funny. The film is full of comedic relief. I like that aspect of the film; it was dark and funny at the same time",Null,0,0,11 May 2010
The Exorcist," A must see
","The Exorcist is a film that has a number of great elements to it. The lighting in the film is excellent. I was really impressed with the films use of sounds. The use of diegetic sounds such as objects, to the piano playing, to Regan's creepy demon voice are impressive. I enjoy the non-digetic music as well. The film is full of scary noises and creepy strange music. Which I felt was fit the films content. Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) is a phenomenal actress. She plays the 12 year old girl who becomes possessed. She is extremely believable. If I didn't know it was a movie I would really think this little girl was possessed. The film overall was done well. I like how real it felt and what makes it real scary is that it makes you wonder if such things could happen.",Null,0,1,25 April 2010
The Graduate," great affects
","The film is remarkable from the plot to the directing, the editing and the cinematography. A 20 year old who had an affair with an older married woman. Then he falls deeply in love with her daughter how blizzard. Not a story that you hear about every day. So many scenes in the movie were filmed beautiful. When Ben and Mrs. Robinson are in the hotel room, Ben is standing by the window. You can the shadow of the blind on top of Ben. It makes it feel as if there is actually moonlight outside. The camera did some cool movement and angles. In one scene the camera is looking out into the room with Ben and Mrs. Robinson. It made it seem like you were in the closet and you were watching them. This film is packed with amazing lighting .You can see the shadows on the actor's faces perfectly. It is remarkable. I love the acting. Ben (Dustin Hoffman) is impressive and totally believable.I enjoyed this film a lot and want to watch it again to see the cool effects and cinematography.",Null,0,0,19 April 2010
Psycho," loved it
","The 1960 hit psycho is truly a classic. I must have first view it when I was 10. When I saw it when I was young it creepy me right out. Now viewing again I wasn't crept out as much but I really got to appreciate the way in which the film is done. I'm a fan of a few of Alfred Hitchcock films. The lighting is amazing. Very light and crystal clear. The film has a straight forward plot structure. The film draws you in. It keeps you interested. First you are following the plot of a lady who has stolen money and on the run. Then she gets killed and you completely forget about her, now you are forces on this creepy hotel and weird owner. The first murder scene is done so well. The woman is in the shower she doesn't notice but the audiences can her, Norman's mother's shadow. You don't see the mothers face but you see her stab. You never see the knife actual stab the girl. This scene I felt was tastefully done. You know that girls gets stab by Normans mother not by seeing her pierce the skin but by the motion of the knife that is shown and the girls lifeless body in a pool of blood. I love how the camera tied the nest scene in by going to the shower drain. Then moves out slowly from her eye, then to the unknown hidden money to a shocked Norman cleaning up his mother's murder. Though the movie you develop pity for poor Norman. He is a kind genuine man. You think he would never hurt a fly. His seems nice and charming a little bit on the weird side. He stuff birds but makes it weird is how much he enjoys it. You feel bad for him because it seems he is trapped by his mother. That she has turned him into a mama's boy. At the end you're in for a crazy twist. Though out the movie the suspense builds up, you can wait to see this bitch. But then you are surprise when you see the mother and who she really is. I never would have guess. I thought that the film was brilliantly done. How the mothers face in never relived till the end. Or why you could only her mother when she is having a conversation with her son when you don't see them. But in the end you understand why and how the film got its name. The end makes so much sense when you re watch the film knowing the ending. At",Null,0,1,29 March 2010
