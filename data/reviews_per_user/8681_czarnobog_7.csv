Requiem for a Dream," Cinematic Masterpiece - Best Drug Theme Film Ever
","A few film directors (notably Oliver Stone with 'The Doors,' Donald Cammell-Nicolas Roeg with 'Performance' and Jerry Schatzberg with 'Panic in Needle Park') have successfully captured the essence of certain drug experiences, but Darren Aronofsky goes deeper than anyone with this exploration of addiction.'Requiem for a Dream' is based on a novel by one of the most controversial and important authors in the history of literature, and Aronofsky did it justice with his innovative and astute direction.The first thing that stands out, from the very first frames of the film, is the totally original soundtrack. It's amazing that this was one of the first movie scores by composer Clint Mansell -- and even more amazing that although the film received a slew of nominations and awards, the composer was only nominated once. The 'modern music' score forms a lush, smooth platform for the choppy but never incoherent storyline and erratic camera moves, and a masterful array of electronic sound efx punctuate the emotional beats.The story is centered around Jared Leto's character, a nice Jewish boy on a very bad track, and the three people closest to him. Ellen Burstyn should have taken the Oscar for her multi-faceted performance as his nice Jewish mama victimized by a pill-pushing doctor, but all four characters are brilliantly portrayed as we follow them on their paths of degradation. Economic snippets of early life flashbacks add depth to their characterizations.Aronofsky is equally adept at capturing the dizzy rapture of drug abuse and the sad descent of the users. The moment when Leto first persuades his girlfriend to fetch some drug money is as fine a cinematic moment as has ever been filmed. While most filmmakers would use close-ups for such an intimate moment, Aronofsky uses a long medium two-shot from behind. Jennifer Connelly's expression (in profile, no less) conveys a wealth of disturbed emotions, while Leto's hidden face and hunched posture are all we need to experience his total shame and desperation. For the first time the nice boy realizes he is now something less than nice. And his higher class girlfriend realizes she is about to cross an irreversible line for him. Or more correctly, for the drugs he has hooked her on. Their happy-go-lucky love affair is no more. Replaced by love of the drug.This film is worth watching on so many levels. The great performances. The brilliant film-making techniques. The uncommon score.If I were a parent, I'd watch it with my children as soon as I felt they were intelligent enough to understand it. It's like a vaccine shot against drug abuse... and against falling into other people's messes.",10,0,1,13 February 2010
Orphan," Best Thriller in Many Years
","I was more than pleasantly surprised by this movie. Based on the title and the trailer, I was expecting a typical soft gut Hollywood formula thriller with a few cheap scares and a namby-pamby pseudo-cathartic ending. What I got was a top notch seat of your pants white-knuckle joy ride.Everything about this film is top of the line, from the beautifully paced screenplay by David Johnson, with rich characters and more suspense than you'd find in your usual Hollywood thriller, based on a great story by Alex Mace.The casting and performances are uniformly superb, but most notable are the three main female characters, who are a bit more complex than you normally get in a genre film from Tinseltown.Vera Farmiga is a fine actress who's been impressive in past roles, but this is a stand-out role that will have everyone remembering her name. Her young co-stars are both outstanding as well. Newcomer Aryanna Engineer is a charming newcomer and Isabelle Fuhrman as the mysterious orphan was simply amazing in this role.Director Jaume Collet-Serra is great not only with the actors but with action and pacing as well. Like Paul Verhoeven, he's one of those rare European directors who handles Hollywood style action better than most American directors.With several top producers on board, including Joel Silver, Don Carmody and Susan Downey, it's not a surprise that the production values are excellent, from the score to the costumes to the efx make-up and stunts.If you're a fan of the thriller genre, this is one you can't miss.",10,2,4,11 June 2010
The Hills Have Eyes," Not as Scary as the Original but Still Fun to Watch
","This movie starts off great. The opening title sequence is beautifully done -- everything, that is, except the title credits themselves. On a big screen they may have been readable, but reduced to a TV screen they are a messy glob of orange. Dark orange which is absorbed by the density of the images behind them. Maybe it's time for movie companies and post houses to start considering that film titles and TV titles are two different things, and separate sets could be made. At least until five foot TV screens are the norm. That is, when everyone has them. Not just the people designing the credits.The casting of the family is superb. What a blessing to see a horror film with a mostly unknown cast. No supermodel ing√©nues like Jessica Biel or Sara Michelle Gellar to detract from the illusion of reality. Considering the quasi-verite feel of the original, which was a huge part of its power, this was an especially wise choice. The costumes and make-up are magnificently mundane, contributing to the build-up of tension. These are characters any average human can relate to, and the hints that they are stepping into something horrific effectively prime us for an explosion of horror.Unfortunately that promise is broken the moment we meet our first bad guy. While the casting of the family is sublime, the actors chosen for the mutant freaks is soft and unconvincing. The lamely designed make-up never disguises the fact that these are normal, even attractive actors. One can only assume that the director, who handled so many aspects of this production perfectly, took a miscalculated gamble that the make-up itself would render the characters frightening. Either that, or someone decided that they wanted this to be a soft horror film. Something to appeal to the undemanding, middle-of-the-road audience, rather than the hardcore horror fans.One of the creepiest things about Wes Craven's original version was the believability of the hill people. Michael Berryman's freakish features combined with his subtly bizarre costume were more unsettling than any of the characters in this remake. Even in their special efx make-up, the new freaks are about as scary as something you'd expect to find in a circus sideshow.One real treat in this film is the cinematography. This is perhaps the most exciting piece of cinematography in the horror genre since Adam Greenberg worked with Kathryn Bigelow on 'Near Dark.' Hopefully the young Belgian cinematographer will continue to grace movies worthy of his very distinctive style, and not wind up shooting bloated Hollywood turkeys... or worse, directing humongous turkeys like Jan de Bont.Older horror fans who caught the original version in a theatre will no doubt view this differently than younger viewers who have no pre-conceived expectations. Those who do note the difference have to call into question Wes Craven's influence in making this one a bit glossier and less frightening. Every year sees more Wes Craven productions, with a wide range of success. The sheer volume and disparity suggests he's more of a rubber stamp than an actual hands on producer -- but the lack of true scariness in this movie may also be the mark of his older, softer sensibilities imposed upon the director.While not as scary as the original, this is an enjoyable film. It's the kind of 'horror movie' that a true horror fan can sit through in the company of friends who are fans of the kind of horror which isn't really very scary but can scare the pants off them.",8,1,1,22 July 2006
Garden State," Charming and Intelligent Delight -- Outstanding American Film
","While the Hollywood studios churn out their endless stream of crappy love stories featuring big stars, all the 'correct' story beats, and half-an-ounce of heart, Zach Braff found one investor with the brains and balls to bankroll this wonderfully quirky and entertaining film about two misfits who stumble into each others lives.The story begins in a daze of imagery appropriate to the main character's mindset, befogged on a slew of legal drugs which have held him in thrall for most of his sorry life. Braff is perfectly charming in the lead role. Part of that charm is his vulnerability. Like Peter Sellers' Chauncey Gardiner in 'Being There,' he's an observer of life rather than a participant. But while Chauncey viewed life through the innocent eyes of a simpleton, Braff's Andrew Largeman filters it through a drug-induced haze, prescribed by his psychiatrist father.Leaving L.A. to attend his mother's funeral in NJ, he gets swept into the tidal pool of his long lost buddies from high school, an assortment of realistic oddballs and dubiously moral characters. He also meets a girl who is just as weird and insecure as he is, a performance which showcases Natalie Portman at her very best.While directors of similar films (like The Station Agent, another good off-the-wall romance set in New Jersey) may do a commendable job with their meager budgets, Braff has done wonders with his. A good part of the production value lies in his use of locations and the slick and artful cinematography, which give the film an expansive feel not often found in small personal dramas.Too often 'quirky' means self-indulgently goofy. Almost every frame of this film is smart and polished and original. It's ten times more entertaining than your average studio comedy.This film was so good it reminded me that the oft-abused state of New Jersey has produced an inordinate number of great talents and huge stars, from Jack Nicholson to Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, Martha and John Stewart, Bon Jovi, Sinatra, Springsteen, Spacey etc etc all starting with Thomas Edison in Menlo Park. 'Garden State' is a fitting tribute to this wellspring of talent, and Zach Braff is as talented as anyone listed above.",10,0,1,1 July 2006
The Descent," Zzzzz... Take a nice nap instead
","Style isn't everything, but this film offers nothing else. Considering how laborious the set-up is, it's a miracle that an ounce of character development couldn't work its way into this flashy mess.Somebody seemed to think that a handful of taut female bodies with a slathering of attitude would be empathetic enough to involve the viewer, but the characters in this film are so blank and uninteresting that neither I nor the group of folks I watched this with could have cared less what happened to any of them.There have been worse 'horror' films made. But I can't remember one that was more boring and pointless than this.The cinematography is totally wrong. Why anyone would choose warm yellow and red scrims to color a descent into the cold chilly bowels of the earth is unfathomable. When the ghoulish action finally starts, the color scheme switches to green, but for some ungodly reason the brains behind this fiasco chose a nice vibrant organic green rather than a pasty fluorescent sickly green which might have added a hint of unsavoriness to the cookie cutter proceedings.It's interesting that many English viewers rate this director's crappy movies so highly. With all the great English directors out there, you'd think they wouldn't be so hard up for glory.If you choose to watch this sorry chunk of offal, dose up with plenty of coffee or Irish breakfast tea before hand. Otherwise be prepared to nod off twenty minutes in.Mercifully, the story is utterly forgettable.",1,56,103,10 February 2007
The Happening," Glorified TV Movie
","It's not easy to criticize someone who seems like such a genuine nice guy, but it's hard to believe that the same person who wrote 'The Sixth Sense' also wrote this movie. But then, the only movie that Shyamalan has written since 'The Sixth Sense' that was original and cohesive and intriguing was 'The Village.' He seems to be a classic example of what happens to many talented artists once they snag the big bra$$ ring.This movie starts off well, although the opening is suspiciously similar to that of Stephen King's novel 'Cell.' The cast is extremely likable. Mark Wahlberg plays against his usual urban tough guy type, playing a milksoppy quasi-hero, which is very appropriate for this milksoppy movie.John Leguizamo stretches a little. Zoey Deschanel, unfortunately, loses her trademark quirky charm in her cardboard characterization of a wife on the verge of straying--a subplot that arises through ponderous dialog, rather than action.This rather lame dramatic device is an early warning sign that Shyamalan is pulling his creative punches once again, and the last two acts of the movie have all the grit and pizazz of a 1970s TV movie. Actually that's unfair--to superior TV movies like 'Duel' and 'Trilogy of Terror.' The characters literally meander through a thin storyline with a monotonously obvious plot. At its worst moments it grinds to a sodden halt, like the scene where Leguizamo has bummed an 'urgent' ride, and the driver waits for what seems like an hour while Leguizamo delivers a valedictory goodbye speech to his chums.Shyamalan needs to stop aspiring to direct 'horror' films, he is obviously too genteel for a genre that has spawned the 'Hostel' and 'Saw' and 'Ring' and 'Living Dead' franchises. Even bloodless masterpieces like Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' would be lucky to satisfy a mass audience today, and 'The Happening' is far from a masterpiece.Considering the somewhat laudable attempt at delivering a message (which is old news, thanks to Al Gore) to the masses, the 'surprise' ending is simply trite, and only makes us hope he wasn't setting up a sequel. The Gaia Theory deserves better.Catch it for free if you can. Or rent it if you enjoy pretending to be scared by pretentious horror non-thrillers with little gore and no licentious material.",3,1,3,6 September 2009
30 Days of Night," A Breath of Fresh Bloody Air for the Vampire Legend!!
","'30 Days of Night' is a very welcome addition to the ranks of vampire movies. This one is strictly for horror fans, not for doily-draped gender-confused romantics dreaming of third degree hickies from pretty fanged lovers in New Orleans.The fun begins in the first frame, courtesy of the evocative setting, a snowbound town at the Northern edge of America. The only iffy moment comes with the introduction of Josh Hartnett as the town sheriff. Young and movie star handsome, he threatens to come off as unbelievable, like the Ben Affleck sheriff in 'Phantoms.' Hartnett, however, despite his young years, has the gravitas to pull off this role, and director David Slade gets masterful performances from all the fine actors in this film.Melissa George is scrumptiously beautiful. (Her mouth is so cute it should be patented.) She's also an excellent actress, who horror fans should remember from the recent (and highly recommended) remake of The Amityville Horror. With her endearing little girl face and keen talent for playing it straight under the most fantastic of circumstances, she's likable, sympathetic and totally believable in this role.What really sets this film apart though is its portrayal of the vampires. Someone obviously boned up on ancient vampire legends, because these are the most authentic movie vampires since Boris Karloff's 'wurdalak' in Mario Bava's 'Black Sabbath' 40 years ago.Speaking in a strange Eastern European tongue (Romanian? or Hungarian?) these creatures bear the remains of human personalities, but are purely evil; cunning and vicious and blood-stained, like vampires were before Bram Stoker introduced the 'new improved' (i.e. sanitized) Victorian model and Anne Rice gussied it up even more.Fans of Kathryn Bigelow's 'Near Dark' and John Carpenter's 'Vampires' will appreciate the high action and body count. The story is a bit slimmer than either of those two films (it is based on a comic book, after all) but it's very atmospheric and suspenseful, with superb production values all around.The visual efx are topnotch, especially when they're subtle, such as snowflakes adding their magical luster to a scene. The special make-up efx (blood and guts et al) are completely believable, but aside from a few very graphic images and much spilled blood in the snow, are not as overwhelming as some overly squeamish reviewers have claimed.The cinematography is gorgeous, and is enhanced by the seamlessly integrated visual effects noted above.If you're in the mood for a nicely paced, well-produced, superbly directed movie that'll satisfy your craving for a dose of traditional horror, you can't go wrong with this one.",10,307,513,19 October 2007
