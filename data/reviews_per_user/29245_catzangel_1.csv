The Ring," An Excellent horror film
","When I had first heard of this movie, I did want to see it. When I finally saw it, it fulfilled my expectations. This movie was truly horrifying, deeply disturbing, and acted very well. I think Naomi Watt did a suburb job portraying the investigative reporter and terrified mother.This movie is great for an extreme late-night chill. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good scare.A 9/10.",10,1,1,11 October 2003
