The Rock," A great movie for the action lover.
","This movie could be one of the greatest action movies ever. The Rock clashed Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery together. Now we all know that each actor is on of the funniest yet most adventurous actors ever. I think that if you see it, you will love it. I don't think that this is a must see for the entire family, due to some language and content. In order to like this movie, you must enjoy gassing of innocent people trying to be stopped, Navy SEALS stopping bad guys, and Military personnel that go bad. Once again, this movie is not for the entire family. Sometimes an odd sense of comedy is tied in with this movie, but not much. Also, if you enjoy special effects, this is an awesome movie for you. Overall, I would rate this movie a 9/10.",9,4,6,26 September 2004
