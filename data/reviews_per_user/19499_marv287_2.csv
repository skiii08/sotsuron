Deja Vu," A mind-boggling film
","I really liked Deja Vu. The movie did a great job on its own interpretation of the word deja vu. Denzel Washington pulls a great job as Carlin. He is great as a detective for the ATF. He did a great job as a corrupt cop in Training Day. I was amazed by the weight gain of Val Kilmer. An actor I liked in Batman Forever and The Saint. Val Kilmer pulls a great job as an FBI agent. Overall, the movie is great, entertaining and thrilling. The film deals with theoretical physics. The movie tries to give an explanation of the folding of space. I recommend this film with an enthusiastic audience. To have an idea about deja vu, I recommend this film. I still think The Prestige by Christopher Nolan does a better job on being a mind-boggling film.",8,4,9,19 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Best Ending for a Trilogy!
","I think the Return of the King was the best ending.  The acting was great and the special effects were spectacular.  It was smart of Peter Jackson to do the trilogy during an era when motion picture technology involved computers.  Without computers, it would have been difficult to make this trilogy.  I enjoyed the superb acting of Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Ian McKellen for Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen for Aragorn.  The four hobbits were performed by great actors.  The battle in the Pelennor Fields and Minas Tirith was the best fight sequence I have ever seen in a motion picture.  It defeats Star Wars and the Matrix combined. The battle seen is the victor of the movies since its beginning.  Arwen had little importance, but focusing on one hobbit named Frodo is not good for attention grabbing.  The alternation of scenes was the best way to keep the audience up.  Arwen was important to the last installment because it shows her love for Aragorn.  The ending could have been shorter, but overall the film has little errors and more achievements.",10,0,0,30 December 2003
