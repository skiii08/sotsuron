The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," what's wrong with the critics ? they can't write one post without insulting the actors and the film !
","It was GREAT!! Probably the greatest after Twilight! 1. Bill's direction was the best, if not second best after Catherine's. 2. The script was definitely the best of them all. 3. Kristen gives the best performance of the four movies. From being nervous to get married, to being completely in bliss, to trying to keep her baby. She was phenomenal. 4. The sex scene were very very sensual but didn't go all the way to sexual. It was really good, I wasn't disappointed but I wanted more. I hope we get to see more on the DVD. I think the scene where they start to have sex for the second time was hotter than the actual sex scene. 5. I loved the scene with her in the black nightie! Rob was so funny. 6. I thought the wedding was going to be a big extravaganza, but it was actually somehow discreet, and very very sweet, especially in the vows and when they kiss after that it was amazing, and with the song playing! 7. A good surprise was the nightmare Bella's having before the wedding where she is dressed as a bride and everyone is wearing white. To be honest I liked the way she looked in the dream wedding more than the actual one. 8. The scene where they hear the baby for the first time and then they cuddle on the couch was the cutest scene ever!! Ever!!! And I loved the fact that they made it just about Bella and Edward and not with Rosalie and Jacob too, like it was in the book. It was an amazing moment! 9. I know we have all been waiting for the sex scene, but I think the birth scene eventually stole the show. It was really powerful and I found myself actually terrified and worried about what would happen even if I knew! Kristen looked completely terrifying and they had a lot of close ups at the scene where she is dead. Rob gave his best Twilight performance ever in that scene, where Bella dies. He was just desperate!! And you could see how desperate he was! He was mesmerizing!! And I loved it when he called her 'baby'! I thought it would sound wrong for Edward if he ever called her baby, but it sounded so right at that moment saying 'come to me baby please' so desperately! 10. I loved the fact that they did not try to stick to the lines of the book. They did that in Eclipse. Months after seeing Eclipse I realized that it had a bad script, because they tried to bring the exact lines of the book to the movie. Fortunately that didn't happen in this one, so it gave more room to the actors to act better, all of them. I think we should congratulate Bill Condon not only for the direction but also for contributing and making a better script. 11. The toasts: funniest scene in the movie. Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick were hilarious!! And I loved how they showed that scene. One toast after the other. 12. The one scene I hated was the wolves talking to each other in their wolf form. Wasn't that weird? It was like robots trying to have a conversation.Overall it's the most mature Twilight, and probably competes with the first one to be the best. To be honest I wasn't very satisfied with New Moon and Eclipse, they just never exactly did it for me. But with Breaking Dawn I was 100% satisfied and well done Mr. Condon! Very nice job!",10,9,26,17 November 2011
