Scarface," The best exsaiting bloody hold breathed gangster movie of 80's
","This's just a magnificant maffia story!!! After seeing this movie for the first time,you will never forget that movie.You'll remember it for the rest of your life.Al Pacino's the way of acting is extraordinary outstanding.It's a long film,but story takes enough time to show the best of it.The music is great...you freeze when you hear it.Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderfull and Steven Bauer plays the best funny player i ever saw.A good act set for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.The final act is superb!!! The chooise for the clothes is very good.....nice outfits/suits for that time.Al Pacino is good in cursing.Miami is the best chooisen location to shoot movie like that,with all that bounch of Cuban tugs!!!!!Don't miss this movie!!!",10,0,0,20 April 2001
