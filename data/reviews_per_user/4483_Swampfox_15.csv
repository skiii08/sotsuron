The Blair Witch Project," DO NOT READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM OR IT WILL DISAPPOINT
","That said, I have to say I was disappointed. On the day when the public finally got to see the year's most anticipated 'serious' film from a dead director, I was anticipating the scariest film about the dead. In other words, this was a film I wanted to like, wanted to get sucked in to and wanted to have scare the bejeezus out of me. When the lights came up after finally seeing 'The Blair Witch Project,' I found I only liked the first half, was only sucked in occasionally and never once felt anything than some mild creepiness.All those clamoring about the film on the internet may or no be real (there's talk in the entertainment industry that much the buzz was planted by the distributor), but the initial reaction at film festivals last winter was undoubtedly uncoached. Thinking that this 80 minute mixed media movie is real would probably make most viewer's skin crawl. But once that cat's out of the bag (and even the most cursory glance at articles about this film give that away), the big gimmick  turns out to be the biggest thing going for it. Not the only thing, but it can't drive the film anymore once a viewer is no longer scammed into thinking the 'In 1994 three student filmmakers went into...' is on the level. All the shots used in promotional stories about 'The Blair Witch Project' are not used in the actual film. It begins with the same preamble that adorns the poster and ad copy. This is a mistake, as it shows a lack of foresight on the filmmakers' part. They should have realized that only the first audience would benefit from complete ignorance, the rest of us might need a sequence that builds the idea that what we are seeing is real. The distributor is obviously trying to sustain the illusion: at my screening a booklet proclaiming itself as the Blair Witch Dossier was given to us in line. Inside are notes from fictitious private investigators and class statements written by the 'missing filmmakers.' If only this had been included in the movie.The most impressive thing about the film (after the chutzpah of its filmmakers) is the improvisation of the actors. There are scenes that rang so true that I will not be surprised next winter if one of the endless series of awards given out goes to one of the three faux documentarians. One scene that starts with gallows humor and ends in near fisticuffs affirmed that those magical moments of theater or recorded acting can still pull us out of our seats. On the basis of it alone I can see why the uninformed would take the events at face value.As with most, 'Blair Witch's' undoing is its last act. As events unfold, the filmmakers repeatedly squander the tension that has gripped the audience. Perhaps a little too attuned to the aesthetics of the documentary-within-a-film they have created, they let its sensibilities guide how they shape the events of the last 20 minutes. Too much of the 'found' footage is allowed to unreel, loosing the dramatic build-up. And after all this overage, the ending is abrupt and confusing. There isn't a single back story to the legend of the Blair Witch but three, which undermines the payoff. We never see anything of the 'presence' that is pursuing them through the woods, so it's hard to even begin to debate if it is supernatural or not. If not for a friend seeing it with me, I'm not sure how long it would have been before I 'got' the ending.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999

Erin Brockovich," YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO SHOUT 'OSCAR!' BUT ITS WORTH A LOOK
","The Nutshell: A feisty young woman, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), arrives at the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney) through the forces of Fate. A twice divorced mother of three with no employable skills, she badgers, cajoles and pleads with Masry to give her a job. He reluctantly hires her as a file clerk. After finding medical records in real estate files, she becomes a de facto investigator to uncover a large utility company's cover-up concerning the contamination of a small town's water supply. As the stakes get higher, the uneducated and untrained Erin must use her considerable wits and genuine empathy to the affected townsfolk to stay not only ahead, but in the game.As is apparent from the description, ERIN BROCKOVICH is film treading on the ground of earlier films. NORMA RAE has given us the gutsy, blue collar woman fighting the big corporation and THE VERDICT has shown us out-of-their-league lawyers having to face very daunting legal challenges. With the Harley-Davidson riding next door neighbor who volunteers (!) to watch her three kids, there's even a shade of MASK's sweet bikers thrown in to boot. When a film has so much past cinema history to compete in the audiences memory against, it has two choices: the minefield or paint-by-numbers. A writer and director could try to approach the story and film in a new way. They can avoid all the clichÃ©s and expectations, and go for something wholly original. But like in a minefield, one misstep and the film implodes from the twin anticipations from both the general audience and the cineastes lead to expect something more.Or, they can capitulate to the idea that there are few new options in presenting real-life stories and make sure they keep the those audience pleasing moment coming at a steady rate. Steven Soderbergh and writer Susannah Grant go the later, and hence, paint-by-numbers route. This is the Soderbergh who gave us OUT OF SIGHT more than the one responsible for THE LIMEY. There is nothing wholly original here in either the film's story line or how it's presented. In fact, BROCKOVICH is such a studio star vehicle he doesn't employ the non-linear editing of those last two films that was becoming his forte.Considering his last films and that his announced future projects are a remake of the piffle OCEAN'S 11 and a film version of the BBC TV show 'Traffic' (about a drug enforcement chief finding out his daughter is a drug mule), Soderbergh seems to be following a one for the studio/one for himself approach to filmmaking. Too bad BROCKOVICH seems to be the studio pic he is doing before starting TRAFFIC. Allowed to work with a more realistic version of Erin (for comparison, pay close attention to the waitress early-on: it's the real Erin Brockovich doing a cameo) and not having to deal with the considerations that go hand in hand with working with someone of Robert's stature it would have been interesting see how different (and very possibly better) this could have been.This is a showy part and Roberts sinks her teeth into it. Roberts here will remind those who remember it of her breakthrough part in MYSTIC PIZZA - a film that had the bad luck of being a movie aimed at women before 'chick flicks' became trendy recently. Definitely worth a rental. She is caustic, forceful and unpretentious. The only problem is Roberts brings so much baggage with her that she never makes the character seem unique. The part suffers from us never being surprised by a larger-than-life character because, well, it's Julia Roberts. It's a wonder why New Jersey Films didn't opt to try this as a low budget film showcasing an actress not as well known. Janet McTeer, who did a similar no-collar turn in TUMBLEWEEDS that prompted several critics to call hers THE performance of 1999, actually looks like the real Erin.Beginning what will hopefully be the start of a interesting late middle-aged phase of his career, Finney consistently infuses his character with the quirks and a real human tics that are just as consistently missing from Roberts performance. Those who were unlucky enough to catch the pointless and boring SIMPATICO (was there ever a more egregious waste of a good title?) will be excused from thinking his turn as the race horse voucher in that turgid film was a warm-up for Masry. As a man who has worked hard and been careful to arrive where he is in life, he had a helluva lot more to lose than Brockovich who is acting out of necessity. Instead of sounding shrill and selfish, Finney manages a nice balancing act between grounding him enough to be solid and letting him let Erin befuddle him. Its a shame that if anyone remembers the film next winter when the next awards season starts, it will be for the wrong performance.Universal left nothing to chance marketing BROCKOVICH, unfortunately for regular movie attendees. Every great zinger and most of the 'You tell'em, girl!' moments are squandered in the trailers. For those who plunk down their $8.50 to discover what made Erin and her story worth telling find that the awfully nice folk in the Universal marketing department  have made sure there is nothing new to discover. It's not hard to like BROCKOVICH. It moves deftly between the expanding professional life of its title character and the repercussions it is having on her home life. It makes a lot of smart choices in what to play up and what events can be skimmed over. As long as its treated as the feel good, unchallenging mainstream studio star vehicle it was fashioned to be,  liking the film will come easy. Just don't expect anything deeper. As either a safe-bet outing at the multiplex or a rental half a year from now, ERIN BROCKOVICH is worth a look. But just remember Olympia Dukakis' retort to Cher in MOONSTRUCK - 'Playing it safe is the dumbest thing a woman like you can do.'",Null,2,4,1 April 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not excellent, but funny as sh**
","'South Park: Bigger, longer & uncut' is an uneven film that is nevertheless hilarious, witty and one of the crudest things you'll see this or any year. Imagine your shock upon seeing the TV episode for Mr. Hankie, the Christmas poo (trust me, if you don't know you don't want to) and triple it. There are fart jokes, women's time of the month jokes and enough explicit gay sex references to make Rupert Everett wince. In addition, there are moments of razor sharp satire (for those unsure which is which, humorists go after their target to make it like a pet; satirists want to mount it over the TV.) concerning 'moral authorities,' the dangers of mob rule and French Existentialism. And did I mention that it's a parody of Disney musicals, with 16 songs? There's even a cgi-enhanced 360 degree tracking shot of Satan (whose lover is Saddam Hussein) as he warbles in melancholy, ala 'Beauty and the Beast!'And there's no way in hell you should let your children see it. 'South Park' is gleefully profane. One musical number is entitled 'Uncle Fu-ka' and you'll be tempted to sing along, for it and many others are very catchy tunes. But unless you're George Carlin I doubt you want your ten year old belting out 'She's a big ol' bitch...' around the kitchen. The reason I said it was uneven is on account of these musical numbers, which begin to become monotonous after awhile. In addition, some scenes do rely too much on the spectacle of the tots cussing a blue streak and the shock wears out quickly. Overall, this crude, crass and sharp film made me laugh out loud more than any film of recent memory.",Null,0,0,9 July 1999
American Pie," AT LAST, THE FIRST FRUIT OF THE SUMMER CROP OF MOVIES
","One of the most emotionally true films of the year has arrived, dressed in the costume of gross out comedy benefiting from 'There's Something About Mary's' raising the bar on semen jokes and other not-for-polite-company material. One of the biggest hurdles to producing a good film about the high school experience - which seems to be a bigger factor in determining character to the average American than college - is getting a handle on believability. With so many seemingly overwhelming forces at work (academic demands, budding sexuality, growing peer pressure), teens lead unacknowledged complicated lives. Also, it is the last time many will be truly unique individuals, before society and its media bombardment flatten out the rough edges. 'American Pie' scores on getting it right.Starting with the casting, this is a film where the writers and director have shunned the 'Hollywood version' with every decision they made. Instead of a cast culled from the best looking members of (fill in teen-targeted TV show here), these are the people I went to class with. The central quartet has only one member of better than average looks. Yet Oz (Chris Kline) is so aware of it that it makes him try awkward come-ons only Sean Connery as 007 could pull off. The rest look like any student you could pick at random out of a yearbook. The central character, Jim (Jason Biggs), is the goofiest looking. Which, of course, is what we all thought of ourselves in high school isn't it?The biggest surprise of 'Pie' to the uninitiated will be that it's antecedents turn out to be not 'Porky's' and rip-offs, but 'The Waltons' and 'Family.' The four buddies learn that getting laid by the prom is not what they thought it would be. Each gets a different 'life lesson' as they pursue unlike paths to that common goal. Those lessons give them and the viewer an unexpected warm-fuzzy feeling. In that regard, 'Pie' will be a valuable political instrument for the next year. 'Say what, Mr Kotter?!' Well, anytime you hear some blow-hard going on about decency and family values and decides to hold up 'American Pie' as an example of Hollywood's moral deficiency, you'll instantly know he's full of s***.The only real deficiency is with a storyline centering on the four young men, the young women don't get much to do beyond interaction. Which is a shame, because it wastes the talent of Natasha Lyonne who I could watch for hours longer than the surface-only charm of Shannon Elizabeth's Hustler-loving Czech exhange student. Alyson Hannigan (who does star in one of those TV teen show, but don't hold it against her) is another standout whose brief screen time does make sense for her character's payoff. But this is a movie about four guys (any writers want to pick up that gauntlet and make one about four gals?).Admittedly, everyone's high school experiences are no the same. 'American Pie's' depiction did mirror my own to a degree that surpasses the last benchmark of well-received school days angst, 'The Breakfast Club.' It's a shame the R-rated comedy will turn off many of those bemoaning the lack of films about values and decency because 'Pie' has those qualities proudly. It doesn't hurt it's also one f**king funny movie.",Null,0,0,2 August 1999

U-571," RUN SILENT, RUN NOT SO DEEP
","THE NUTSHELL:  At the height of the WW II German U-boat campaign in the North Atlantic against allied transports, one member of those dreaded 'Wolf Packs' is disabled and adrift. Military Intelligence catches on to the situation and realizes it has the opportunity to capture the key to all German communications, the cipher machine code named 'Enigma.' Pressed into the service of an intelligence officer and Marine Commando leader (David Keith), is the crew of an aging U.S. submarine. XO (Matthew McConaughey) and his men find themselves camouflaged as another German sub and in a race to reach the U-boat before the actual supply ship does. The name of their quarry is: U-571.If you think you can faintly hear the sound of a military drum march while reading the above, the producers of U-571 are your type of moviemakers. Not only is the standard rousing march provided, so is almost every single element from every submarine niche movie ever made. To call them clichés is a little unfair, for as with any setting there are certain rudiments that are hard to avoid. A movie made around semi-trucks is bound to contain shots of the wheels turning, gears being jammed and the occasional hiss of air breaks. So too will your underwater warfare flick feature such stock items as the skipper at the periscope, the call of DIVE! DIVE! DIVE! and fish (torpedoes) being launched. When it comes to theses obvious expectations, U-571 delivers handsomely. Therein lies the problem.Moviegoers who simply want a good, well told story delivered with the current level of craft regardless of unoriginality cannot ask for a better return on their two hours of time and seven bucks. Go see U-571, it doesn't disappoint. Yet, neither does it surprise. With the exception of the basic premise of the actual mission to retrieve the code machine (seen in countless other genre pictures, including one of the better Roger Moore Bond films - FOR YOUR EYES ONLY) there is not a single scenario left unused by the end of this thing. Crews being rattled by depth charges while looking fearfully up? It's here. Cat and mouse games with a destroyer dropping those depth charges? That's here. Putting debris in the water to fake the sub's 'death?' Yep, it's here too. RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP, CRIMSON TIDE, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and the uberfilm of submariners DAS BOOT have all contributed to U-571's bag of tricks.None of this is meant to insult the audience's intelligence. In fact, there's plenty of evidence that the filmmakers actually respect it. Several characters are killed without the usual fanfare to make it clear to the audience what has happened (although the similarity between Jack Noseworthy and Jon Bon Jovi made it a little confusing who 'bought it' there). The sub lingo comes as fast and furious as it must in real life when lives are at stake, made even more cloudy when the characters themselves can't read the identifications on the German boat. The positions of the various crew members have to be sussed out as they do their job instead broadcast bad-movie style, ala: 'Ensign Huff here is the best rudder man in the Navy.'Not that U-571 is without it's clunkers. Harvey Keitel is the chief of the boat, a salty dog who actually says (while belting whiskey no less) 'I got da sea in my blood.' McConaughey has been passed over for his own command because his skipper (Bill Paxton) doesn't think he's cut out for command yet because of the XO's closeness to the crew. And in one of the biggest insults to the audience, just in case they don't get it that it's wartime and you must kill your enemy in sometimes cold-blooded ways, the Germans machine gun a life raft of survivors from ship they just sank so when the Yanks pull a Trojan horse maneuver later it won't seem less than sporting. There are a few technical gaffs the pickier viewer will pick up on: there's no light at the depth the sub is seen at and a seasoned sub pro has pointed out that you cannot start diesel engines underwater (WWII era subs cruised on the surface, submerging only to attack or evade using precious battery reserves to do so).The most surprising thing about this lack of surprise is who is presenting it, co-writer and director Jonathan Mostow. Two years ago he reworked the well-trod thriller path of a driver against unknown assailants out in the American wasteland into the excellent, stipped-down, very underappreciated BREAKDOWN. For filmgoers sake, I hope the blame for U-571's failures can be traced to the probable culprit, Dino De Laurentis. Writer-directors who make first rate action films are few compared to those working in strictly dramatic or comedic arenas. Outside of James Cameron and possibly the Wachowski Brothers, most helmers are hired guns.Back in the 30's and 40's, studios like RKO and Republic churned out basic genre pictures that stuck to a tried and true formula which satisfied audience expectations if only rarely giving them anything original. It was escapist fare, judged solely on meeting those expectations. That's U-571. In addition to all the usual sub aspects listed above, the period details and the subs themselves bear mentioning. Along with the various duty uniforms, there's a dance scene early featuring a room full of dress whites and women's 40's era clothes for those who love the details of nostalgia. The dockside set is toyland of jeeps, trucks and naval personnel milling about. The production definitely did no skimp here.Then, there are the sub sets. Anyone who assumes that they simply went to some place like Chicago (home to U-505, from which an enigma machine was taken during the war) and shot the real thing can be forgiven their misinformation. Using Cinecitta's famed craftsmen, the production built their sub interior in Rome. It is a marvel of pipes, moving gears and gauges. Universal will be criminal if they do not campaign next winter for Best Design on their behalf.The best praise, albeit somewhat faint, I can bestow on U-571 comes down to who I would recommend this to: my dad. Like most of the general public, my dad sees maybe half a dozen films a year (not counting Bond repeats) mostly on cable. He grew up during the war and was raised on those RKO and Republic features. A war movie can ONLY mean knocking the hell out of Nazis or Toho's boys. For any regular film habitué who demands a little more out of cinema, the movie is forgettable and unsurprising tale that might not exactly make your 10 or 20 best list for 2000. It won't make your worst, either. But my dad's gonna love it. RECOMMENDATION: Can see now with no rush or wait for video.",Null,0,1,22 April 2000
Pearl Harbor," BORA BORA BORA*
","*My congratulations to Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, I could not resist using this.Just how good or bad PEARL HARBOR is taken to be will depend on how many films the moviegoer has seen and therefore how large their internal database of war movie cliches is; in other words the more is definitely not the merrier here. Even films that are only set during the WW II era are at risk to be plagiarized, as a plot device of THE CIDER HOUSE RULES shows up. Yet no matter how many they throw into PEARL, it never seems to get interesting. Summer movies are expected to be dumb, but boring? Anyone following Randall Wallace's career should not find this too surprising as BRAVEHEART (with much input from Gibson I suspect) is looking more like the exception from the man who once wrote for the tv show 'Hunter.' And anyone familiar with Michael Bay's oeuvre should know better than to expect him to realize or care how much work the script needed. He has far more respect for bomb trajectories than story or character development.What is surprising is that for Jerry Bruckheimer film, it is surprisingly miscast. With characters so uninspiringly written, getting actors that could bring something to the part was essential. Instead, we get the WB Goes to War of choices. Ben Affleck continues to make the case for not being cast as the lead in action roles (REINDEER GAMES and ARMAGEDDON too quickly forgotten, with him taking over the Jack Ryan role yet to come. Yikes!). Compounding this, they cast Josh Hartnett so as not to overshadow him. No worries there as Hartnett seems to be channeling Clint Eastwood, right down to the squint. As to their object of mutual affection, Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress but doesn't have the pep or spark that inspires love triangles.Just how good this film could have been is evident in the fact that the very same visuals that are wasted on a screenplay that could have been bested by simply shuffling together an old 'Love Boat' script with one from 'The A Team' were cut together to make one of the best coming attraction trailers of the last ten years. Using Hans Zimmer's THIN RED LINE score ('The Village' for those who want to run out and find it), it suggested in under four minutes the scope, humanity, pathos and majesty this story demands that are not to be found in the bloated three hours of the actual film.The only real redeeming aspect of this otherwise mind-numbingly boring film is luckily for the filmmakers the raison d'etre the vast majority of ticket buyers are showing up for - the bombing of Pearl Harbor sequence. Clocking in at 35 minutes, it will for some audience members be worth the admission. Torpedoes slam into hulls, bombs crash through decks and all manner of pyrotechnic mayhem is unleashed in a torrent of flying debris. It never approaches the intensity of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or the scale of THE PHANTOM MENACE, but works on it's own level. Very few shots have the cartoony feel that so much CGI effects impart, the truly sad exception being the explosion of the Battleship Arizona. Great explosion... and unrealistic as hell. Nothing matches the grandeur of the 'money shot' from the trailer, the one that follows the bomb from the plane all the way to the deck.The only problem with this maelstrom is that it has no sense of geography or scale. One never knows where the different locations are in relation to one another and the entire fleet seems to be sitting in one place. Once the attack commences, it seems that same nine planes are unleashing the munitions while the other 270 are off elsewhere, taking pictures perhaps. Not to mention the chronology of events becomes hazy, the first wave indistinguishable from the second. There's a reason most films that deal with large scale assaults, like MIDWAY, use a lot of subtitles to identify the players and locations.There's an old joke about Deadheads that goes one day at a Greatful Dead concert they ran out of drugs and one Deadhead turns to the other and says 'Wow, man, the band really sucks.' So goes the joke, so goes PEARL HARBOR. Every year or so a film manages to become through both design and happy accident the beneficiary of want-to-see hype. In PEARL HARBOR's case the usual wave of interest that such hype produces has become a tsunami because of an alignment of unique factors, most notably the absence of any other event films this summer that appeal to such a broad range of sex and ages. What does any of this have to do with how good a film PEARL HARBOR is? Nothing, but it will explain why two days after seeing it very little will be memorable and why years down the road battle sequences aside the movie will then seem pretty lame. In other words, 'Wow, dude, the movie really sucks.'",Null,0,0,28 May 2001
28 Days Later...," DON'T BUY INTO THE HYPE
","On a personal level, I can say that not only did this movie make me wonder what some critics and the fan-boys here see in it, but not a single person I know who has seen it has thought it was any good. The few times it ever offers a 'made you jump, ha ha ha' moment they are cheap and involve characters doing something stupid. For the first 45 minutes of 28 DAYS LATER (following a forced, confused PETA raid sequence that doesn't work) it seems that Danny Boyle might have found a new genre to breath life into. SHALLOW GRAVE was the first top-notch thriller since DEAD CALM and TRAINSPOTTING was a return to enlightening while entertaining lower end economic social commentary pretty much abandoned in the mid 70's. So the promising start of 28 DAYS raises one's hopes, after the wise cracking and near parody of the ELMSTREET and SCREAM franchises, Doyle might have produced the first great horror film in a long time (since perhaps HALLOWEEN). Alas, Danny shoots his creative wad in those 45 minutes and the rest of the film becomes a tragic miscalculation attempting to meld a horror film with a ON THE BEACH/DAY AFTER lone human survivors infighting story.One of the things the film first has going for it before Doyle looses his nerve and goes Hollywood is the unknown but very good actors he cast in the lead roles. One of the advantages of small films is the fact that their unknown casts help pull audiences into their worlds without the distraction of 'Hey, its the guy from Dawson's Creek!' But then Doyle first uses Brendan Gleeson, then Christopher Eccleston to remind the viewer 'its just a movie with that guy from GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS.' Which is pretty ironic, because Eccleston was unknown when he did SHALLOW GRAVE.For those who don't see that many films, this is certainly one to skip unless you want to feel disappointed and used by the publicity machine.

","If you are the brainless, easily entertained fan boy type moviegoer that Hollywood depends on these days, man is this the film for you. Only this isn't a film. It's 88 minutes of various ingredients that put together by filmmakers who actually give a damn about their craft might cook, but not this boring oatmeal. Imagine if someone gave you three raw eggs, some tomatoes, cheese and ham and called that an omelet. That is the nutshell of what MEN IN BLACK II is all about. To put it another way, if you can remember back to '97 when the original came out then you should remember that it wasn't all that great either. But after a summer that started with SPEED 2, CON AIR and BATMAN & ROBIN the original was a nice diversion. If you want to see a film about humans defeating aliens intent on destroying the earth and are hellbent on paying $9 for the privilege, then see LILO & STITCH. Or at least give yourself some sort head injury.",1,5,9,7 July 2002
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Yet More Hollywood Tripe...
","(...Is Available For Closed-Minded, Know-Nothing, Proudly Ignorant Types. Feel free to watch it if a fresh prospective on history will challenge your world-view too much).Above all, GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK, is a very well made film that shows the skill with which George Clooney brought CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND to the screen was not a fluke. It is not a bio pic or a broad message film. Instead, it concentrates its attentions on what happens when one man decides to exercise his constitutional rights to challenge a public servant whose actions are causing real pain to American citizens in the name of 'national security.' The story stays laser-focused on Edward Morrow and his team as they grapple with the impact this servant is having on their beliefs in what America stands for and their personal lives. It is done with style, class and gripping actual drama. To paraphrase the usual definition: melodrama concerns how the plot pushes the characters forward, drama shows it is the characters who push the plot along.GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is about an issue that could not be more relevant today: the issue of destroying individual rights in the name of protecting them. Anyone who trots out the hoary claim that this film is about attacking communist-hunters has either not seen it or cannot grasp the difference between questioning methods versus questioning goals. Several times it shows Morrow telling his television audience that he finds communism to be against his beliefs and rightfully has no place in the US.What he objects to is the way Sen. McCarthy used methods better suited to the Soviet Union to search it out, not caring if such methods would destroy innocent American lives. Milo Radulovich was not the only US citizen who was shown at the time and history has confirmed was guilty only of being yet more meat for the grinder of McCarthy's tactics. The fact that he was a man serving his country and tried (contrary to our laws) entirely on the basis of 'sealed' very questionable evidence is what makes his inclusion the heart of Morrow's reason to attack McCarthy's methods.Yes, this is a film about ideas. If that makes it 'preachy' to you and you like your movies to simply entertain you, then the other 99% of what gets released each year is probably more your speed. Because at the end of the night, the only two valid sides in discussing this film are pretty simple: you either believe believe that destroying even thousands of innocent, loyal American lives is justified to protecting us when some elected officials claim it is; or you think that to do so pretty much invalidates the principles the country were founded upon.GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK says it believes the latter and could have easily closed with this, my favorite quote about real patriotism: 'They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.' <ul><li>Benjamin Franklin</li></ul>",9,3,5,29 October 2005
The Green Mile," Sophomore Curse Strikes Again.
","Very few filmmakers can dodge the cinematic equivalent of the Sword of Damocles, the sophomore curse. It basically says that the second film the director of a critical or box office success will in all likelihood suck (no one said it was literary). Paul Brickman was supposedly so afraid of it that it took him six years following 'Risky Business' to give us 'Men Don't Leave' which proved he had a lot to fear (and hasn't directed since, only writing lame fare such as 'True Crime'). The most notable exception, and remember the exceptions prove the rule boys and girls, is Quentin Tarantino. His sophomore effort was 'Pulp Fiction.' Frank Darabont isn't so lucky. (Nitpickers please note: while Darabont has indeeded directed before 'Shawshank,' those were TV productions and not studio releases to which the 'curse' applies)Like 'Resevoir Dogs,' 'The Shawshank Redemption' didn't really find it's audience until hitting video and cable. As a collector of laser discs, I can tell when a movie has reached certain plateau of being a cherished experience for viewers: when I can't find used copies. I can't recall ever seeing a 'Shawshank' in the used bin. Darabont has stored up a lot of goodwill over his debut and it was a shame to have to watch him waste it over three hours in a theater the other night. And waste it he does in the bloated, plodding and tired 'The Green Mile.' I would like to thank him for one thing: thank you, THANK YOU, for keeping the article in the title. Too bad his 'Shawshank' star Robbins didn't do the same for 'Cradle Will Rock.'If another movie is opening this winter with more goodwill towards its success I'd be hard pressed to name it. Tom Hanks! Stephen King! The same dude behind 'Shawshank!' Talk about cutting a broad swath across a potential audience pool. One wants to like this movie. Which is why it will take a few days to a week for many to realize that 'The Green Mile' has fallen victim to the curse. For some the moment might not come until six months from now when they are perusing the 'New Releases' section and find they can easily skip over a second viewing of this disappointment.The movie stumbles from the opening frame, first with a posse that pretty much looks like what they are - a bunch of extras in hillbilly overalls. Then Darabont makes the same mistake 'Saving Private Ryan' did with a wholly unneeded present day bookend device that adds not one iota to our understanding of the film. What lies between is an even bigger letdown. For one thing, Tom Hanks manages a reversal of the usual disparity between an actor's age and that of the characters by actually looking younger than the 44 his Paul Edgecombe is supposed to be. Hanks also looks a bit miscast as head guard for the squad that keeps the peace on death row. As arguably the most bankable star of today, Hanks is prone to the occasional miscasting for those whose memories don't go back across the gulf of time to 'The Bonfire of the Vanities.'  Missing from 'Mile' is 'Shawshank's' unerring cinematography and production design. While some scenes set in Edgecombe's house, especially the kitchen, were windows to a time most of us have never seen, others just didn't have that verisimilitude the milieus in Shawshank afforded. Here's a movie set in Louisiana that rarely has characters sweating. I will give Darabont a lot of credit by not ducking the racial overtones of his period, however. Anyone who thinks it's racist for a 1930's black prisoner is defer to his guard as 'Yessum, boss'  must have studied their history from the same book that sells the Utopian version of the 50's everyone wanted Reagan to bring back. Another element of woeful inadequacy was the score. For a film like this to succeed in selling the aura of miraculousness, an uplifting and powerful score goes a long way in helping to get across the wonder of what we see. Which is 'The Green Mile's' biggest stumble, this inability to make one in awe of John Coffey's healing power.Not trimming this movie from it's 188 minute running time was writer/director Darabont's worse decision. Jettisoning the unneeded bookend would have saved 20 minutes right off the bat. Deciding that he was making a movie about miracles in a prison and not the evils of capital punishment by electrocution could have saved another 15 to 25, especially the hammy scenes with Harry Dean Stanton rehearsing the condemned men's last steps. Overall, the film needed tightening as every scene dragged on killing whatever momentum it had built up for the film as a whole. Darabont's not the only director to have gone this bloated route lately. Perhaps someone should circulate a memo on how and why a film should run past the customary 120 minutes or less. I could suggest a film to watch, one I happen to see this week - 'The Right Stuff.' There's' a movie that needs 3 hours or so to tell its story. Sure, you could cut out all the Chuck Yeager stuff and save about an hour. But without Yeager, it would loose it's heart and soul. Even in 188 minutes, 'The Green Mile' never seems to find its.",Null,0,1,12 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Visually Stunning, But Has The Soul Of A Droid
","When I saw Revenge of the Sith on Thursday in Westwood at the Village it was with a packed house of hyped-up mostly under 30 fans, in other words the optimum type of crowd to be in the right frame of mind to like/love it. There were light sabers all over the place and several people had sneaked in big beach balls that the crowd started flying around. Then the house lights dimmed, the curtain lowered and the applause level really took off.The first trailer was for Stealth, Rob Cohen's 'See, it's The Terminator combined with Top Gun' killer robot plane movie. If this group was any indication, it won't be box office darling this summer as it garnered huge boos. The rest of them did better, War of the Worlds, Fantastic Four and Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Surprisingly, it wasn't Fantastic Four that got the biggest applause, but Smith. Guess when you have both Angelina and Brad in a movie, there's someone for all members of the audience to want to screw.Then the Fox logo came on with it's rather Prussian march and extended Cinemascope score. When the Lucasfilm logo, followed by the immortal words 'A Long Time Ago, In A Galaxy Far, Far Away...' came up, the roar of the crowd drowned out the music. Finallly the movie started in earnest with what I saw in hindsight was the spectacular giant space battle that Lucas could not end the movie with. Yet once this was over and the story had to return to scenes involving dialog and characters - two things that cannot be fussed with later using CGI - Lucas was back where he is the weakest.You could sense the excitement falling as the minutes ticked by, helped appreciatively whenever the audience had to endure yet another wince-inducing Anakin/Padme moment (even this crowd was having big belly laughs over 'Hold me like you did that time on Naboo' and other such lines). I think a collective sense of diminishing expectations kept those critics who have written near-raves of this thing from seeing what should be apparent to all: this is actually the biggest failure of the entire double trilogy. All you have to realize is that this film works or does not work based on one simple premise: do we care about Anakin and Padme? This entire thing revolves around us becoming emotionally involved in their relationship and ensuing plight.And... We... Don't...Give...A...S**t. Without them to hold the center, the rest becomes the longest product reel for an effects house ever. Hell, yes, the battles were impressive, the CGI work at times so well done they looked like live effects instead of optical ones.But this film has the soul of a droid. Towards the end, Lucas seems more occupied by his paint-by-numbers attempt to shoe-horn every bit of saga arcana that harbingers events in the ensuing trilogy withing the last 15 minutes of Sith. 'See, this is why Yoda ends up on Dagoba.' 'Look! It's the ship from the next one!' 'This is why Obi Wan lives so close to Luke.' Instead, we should be having our hearts broken along with Padme and gripped by Anakin's wretched decent into evil.Lucas has always been weak when it comes to emotional things. He once remarked that if you wanted to affect an audience that way all he had to do was show it a kitten, then strangle it. The films that have moments of genuine human moments between characters were written and mostly directed by someone else. Han and Leah in Empire, Indy and Marion in Raiders, Luke and Leah in Jedi. What you have here is Lucas strangling the life out his main characters, but many of us just didn't care.",4,2,5,25 May 2005
The Matrix," see this movie, see this movie, see this movie!
","The above is not just repetition of its own sake, I HAVE seen this film three times in three days. If you haven't rented any of the last year's sci-fi flicks (Lost in Space, Deep Impact, Godzilla, Armageddon), better do it now because after seeing The Matrix they'll look like s**t (Godzilla looks like it anyway, but...).As any friend can attest, I see a lot of films. I have my own laser disc home theater. I haven't been tempted to see a film twice in the theater since... I think Speed, and that was on account of a girlfriend wanting to see it (no huge Keanu Reeves fan either). Before that I think was T2.This isn't a review and don't read any comments that are. This sucker does have a story (if maybe a little too thick for older film critics to understand, same as their VCRs) that is spoiled by too much foreknowledge. The rest of its elements (design, cinematography, acting, visual & physical effects, sound, soundtrack, casting, editing, direction) were approached with an absolute love of craft. It might not be a film for all tastes, but for a film lover it is one of the tastiest surprises since John Woo/Hong Kong cinema.If The Phantom Menace is this year's main course, film lovers please help yourselves to the appetizer. 'Cause, baby, this film rocks!",9,0,0,4 April 1999
Donnie Darko," ONLY MINOR FLAWS IN THIS ORIGINAL GEM
","THE BULLET AND THE BOTTOM LINE - this is the usual run-of-the-mill boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy introduces girl to his imaginary 6 foot tall evil rabbit buddy with a metallic skull-like mask. As if making it in the world of the late 80's American zeitgeist while dealing with girls and evil rabbits weren't enough, he also has to deal with self-help gurus, terrorist classmates and seeing Katherine Ross as a middle aged therapist ('middle-aged' being a polite term for frightfully older). DONNIE DARKO is a film that will have trouble finding an audience because it challenges them with both a mentally disturbed protagonist and the big boogieman of studio zipperheads - the ambiguous ending ('...audience because it challenges them...' being a polite way to suggest that fans of 'Touched By An Angel' are likely to be confused  by it). DARKO is a thought provoking film that joins MEMENTO on the too short list of smart and entertaining films released this year.What's new about this story, besides the Harvey-as-the-Terminator, is that writer and director Richard Kelly sets DARKO in the last months of the Reagan Era, October 1988. George Bush (the original, not the sequel) is seen making some later to be embarrassing debate statements about his good friend Manuel in Panama who couldn't possibly be involved with drugs and money laundering. While it does have the de rigueur period soundtrack and cultural icon references, Kelly does his best to keep them in the background. So, even though Tears For Fears provides the music for a montage and the now forgotten children's game of Hungry, Hungry Hippos is the punchline to a therapy session, the kids attend a private school that thus keeps the clothes and hairstyles subdued. In fact, probably the most remarkable thing about DARKO is how tightly Kelly keeps both the overall tone and his protagonist's performance reined in to maintain a restrained quality to them.The Donnie Darko of DONNIE DARKO is very much, without-a-doubt slipping into dementia. There are no coy games being played here as in K-PAX of whether or not Donnie is seeing the things he thinks he is seeing. By not giving in to the Hollywood impulse of having the mentally disturbed character either capable of incredible human insight that has him tossing off bon mots of wisdom or a cute crackpot who says funny nonsensical non sequiturs, DARKO allows for something much more human. And unpredictable, which becomes the source of DARKO's tension. As likeable as Donnie is, there is always the foreboding sense that he is liable to really go off the deep end any moment. Given the countdown gimmick in the film, it is inevitable that something is going to happen. Which is to say, Kelly has a lot riding on the actor inhabiting the title character.Seldom do performances deserve the heaps of praise they are swathed with, the part being so showy that the appraisers confuse the uniqueness of the character with the gifts of the actor (Dustin Hoffman in RAINMAN or Al Pacino in SCENT OF A WOMAN just to name two Academy Award winning ham-fests). This has less to do with the actual performance than the reviewers desire to be the one to find the 'next Brando.' Much harder to appreciate is the skill to pull off a nuanced character who manages to emote on a broad range with subtle shadings. Being able to do this while portraying a mentally disturbed boy without resorting to scenery-chewing histrionics is a rare feat and Jake Gyllenhaal should be on the very very short list of noteworthy performances this year for doing it. Two years ago he showed his chops in his first starring role in OCTOBER SKY and DARKO confirms that that performance was no lucky fluke. If the part was bigger, Drew Barrymore would also deserve any awards she will probably garner for what is arguably her first real adult role of the English teacher Ms. Pomeroy.The young-bold-teacher-with-radical-new-ideas is not exactly a cinema first, but Barrymore plays it so completely free of inappropriately ennobling tics that it seems fresh. It's not so much the part but that it is Barrymore playing it that the surprise here. Another former child actress moving to older parts is Jena Malone, most recognizable from STEPMOM. As the love interest, she does a lot with the little time Kelly allows for her. Looking down the road, it is easy to see Malone segueing to leading lady roles. This is not to suggest that the rest of the cast is dogmeat for all do more than well enough. One of the few stumbles that Kelly makes is Kittie Farmer (Beth Grant) a preachy teacher and book banner who is at first blush a cliché. At one point she wears a very 80's religiously sloganed t-shirt. But surrounded by such unique characters Farmer comes across like people who do in fact act like clichés.A lot of the film's strength comes from the fact that these characters surrounding Donnie are given a real human depth, most notably the Darko parents who are given the rare-for-fictional-parents facet of unique senses of humor. Unlike other Hollywood worlds where the parents are portrayed as the likely source of a disturbed child's mental illness, the Darkos are seen as real people doing what they can to help their son. There's a pathos to this depiction of the realistic randomness of dementia. All of which goes towards making DONNIE DARKO one of the original gems of filmmaking to come out this year. It is not a perfect film, having an awkward third act deus ex machina and developments that hint too strongly towards a supernaturalism that is out of place. But these are minor complaints for such a unique film.",8,0,0,3 November 2001
