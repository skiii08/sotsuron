The Blair Witch Project," How is it even possible that this movie is this overrated?
","For the most part, this film is just three hikers who get lost in a haunted forest and then suddenly disappear but there's absolutely nothing scary about it, we don't even get to see the Blair Witch in it's physical form. Majority of this film is just the three main characters arguing with each other back and forth until they disappear, I'll never understand how anyone can think this is one of the stronger 
found-footage syle films, because it's not. This movie is as weak as they come. Paranormal Activity 4 was a light year better than this crap.",3,2,5,27 May 2018
Gravity," HOLY CRAP!!! HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A MOVIE TO BE THIS IMPACTFUL!?
","Almost every person I knew told me that Gravity was one of the worst space films they've ever seen. However, I found that hard to believe with all of the insane reviews that this movie had, so I figured I'd give Gravity a shot and may I just say, Holy Crap!I had my expectations for Gravity set at the highest level possible and it met my expectations perfectly. Yeah the story is very short and linear, but the acting and CGI is so beyond perfect that it makes the story work. I honestly wouldn't change a thing about this movie in fear that I would somehow ruin it from being the masterpiece that it is. Congratulations to Alfonso Cuarón and his son Jonas Cuarón on this masterpiece.Gravity has now not only become my favorite space film, but also my new favorite film in general. What people need to understand is that this is not a film that's meant to have extraordinarily fictious and theoretical views like Interstellar, but instead a realistic and terrifying space film. If you walk into this movie with the correct mindset, then you too will see why this movie is one of a kind.",10,3,5,9 April 2019
The Babadook," Did I see a different movie than everyone else?
","Why does this movie have a 6.8/10? This movie was great, the plot twist at the end of this movie was bone chilling. The pacing of the movie was fantastic, throughout the entire movie we're constantly being hinted at a greater appearance of The Babadook which we do get. This movie does what anyone could possibly ask for, it delivers a chilling story.",8,2,3,27 May 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Best Superhero Movie Of 2017 by far!
","Thor Ragnarok was an amazing movie that not only surpasses its predecessors, but also surpasses any other superhero film from 2017. Better than Wonder Woman, Better than Guardians Of The Galaxy: Vol. 2, and certainly better than Spider-Man: Homecoming.This movie had the most powerful feels, the best laughs by far, the best CGI and special effects, and by far best Villain out of the three Thor films.See Thor Ragnarok immediately if you haven't already!",9,2,8,29 April 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Will NEVER be half the legend that The Amazing Spider-Man was.
","This movie was simply Disappointing. The only reason this movie gets praise is because Spidey is finally apart of the MCU. However, there are so many reasons that this is an absolute joke of a film in comparison to it's predecessors. Tom Holland is one of the few good actors in the movie. I like Holland a lot, although he didn't capture the character like Andrew Garfield did he really does look like Peter Parker. That being said his suit looks like anything except Spider-Man. His suit is 100% trash in this film, it looks like it was bought from Party City, also why the actual hell does the suit talk!? Also why is it a girl talking for the suit instead of a dude!? They completely ruined the concept of the suit. Please just give us something identically similar to suits of Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Their suits actually look like Spidey. Another point I want to make is how inaccurate from the comics and cartoons this film is. Now, I never got fully into the comics like some have, but I have seen a Spider-Man comic before. One example of this movie being inaccurate is the character 'Flash'. Why is Flash a loser in this film? Flash is supposed to be a theeatening jock, which was done perfectly in The Amazing Spider-Man, but in this film he's just as geeky as Peter. Also, why is MJ called 'Michelle Jones' instead of Mary Jane Watson? What is the point of all of these stupid and laughable changes? Finally, this doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie at all. Tom Holland's character is wasted throughout the film. He's such an amazing actor and instead of making him act like a legitimate Spider-Man, they make him act like a total punk. Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man is ultra strong. Being able to hold together ships as well as stopping the Winter Soldier's punch is just one of the many impressive things his character has pulled so far, but in one seen he somehow gets intimidated by a thug. WTF!? What a way to make Tom Holland look weak. Spider-Man could snap that dude's spine like a toothpick if he wanted to do so. This movie makes no sense. I don't care how many people I piss off in this review, but this is easily one of the worst superhero movies I've seen. Spider-Man 3 is the only movie that's worst than this film. I feel like giving it a 5/10 is being a bit too generous, but I suppose it's possible that it could've been worse. That being said, it was still a pretty bad movie.",5,1,3,5 September 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," This movie doesn't get the credit it deserves.
","The Amazing Spider-Man towers over the Sam Raimi trilogy. You can people can get mad all you want but this movie is the closest thing to a real Spider-Man that we have ever gotten. Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man. Both of suits from the first and second Amazing Spider-Man are both jaw dropping. Also, unlike Tobey Maguire and Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield is actually funny and sarcastic. Maguire and Holland aren't bad actors by any means but they just didn't fit the persona of Spider-Man anywhere near as good as Garfield did. Not only was Garfield a great Spider-Man but he was also a great Peter Parker. Garfield's take on Peter showed us what a true 21st Century version of Peter Parker would be like. Tobey and Tom's portrayal just felt too forced and not relatable at all. My only problem with The Amazing Spider-Man was that I felt that the origin story was too short. The origin isn't bad but it could've been better. As of 2018, The Amazing Spider-Man is BY FAR the best Spider-Man movie we have ever had. It's so sad and annoying when you have Sam Raimi Fanboys trying to convince people that this movie is awful, when it's actually a misunderstood movie. Sam Raimi fanboys only know what they grew up with and refuse to adapt to anything else.",9,2,3,2 September 2018
Avengers: Endgame," The New Best Film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
","Since its release in 2012, The Avengers was for the longest time my favorite MCU film. Thor Ragnarok came close, but it fell short. After seeing the raw emotion that Endgame had, I had finally came to the conclusion that this movie is the new king of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Go see this movie immediately! As of May 4th, Avengers: Endgame is the best film this year.",9,2,6,4 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Third best in the franchise
","Yes this movie has a fun and heart touching story, but if we're talking about the most impressive aspect the it would be how beautiful and realistic the animation to this movie is.Pixar Studios have certainly come along way with how realistic and detailed their movies look. The textures and reflection looked as if the makers were filming legitimate objects, it's that good.For me, it goes:1. Toy Story 2
2. Toy Story
3. Toy Story 4
4. Toy Story 3Everyone in the family should enjoy this movie, and that can be said for all of the toy story movies.",7,6,23,21 June 2019
Insidious," How is this movie not critically acclaimed?
",Insidious is a 2010 paranormal horror film that tells one of the most thought provoking stories in horror history. This is not your typical family terrorized by demon or poltergeist movie. Insidious itself presents one of the most unique methods of storytelling by introducing factors that have feel like they have never been introduced before it. James Wan and Leigh Whannell did an absolute spectacular job on this project and is easily one of my all time favorite projects of theirs. If you either love horror films or have an interest in them then there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't check this one out. You're just simply cheating yourself.,9,1,1,13 April 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men: Apocalypse Still Rises!
","I agree it's not as good as X-Men: First Class or X-Men: Days Of Future Past, but this movie was fantastic up until the end. Apocalypse is a very unique and interesting character with a badass look. I love the dedication that was put into every other character trying to beat him, I just wish Apocalypse felt stronger, this is supposed to be the X-Men's equivalent to Thanos and they completely half assed the final fight. I feel like giving it anything like a 6 and below is being a bit overdramatic.",7,0,1,11 June 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Decent Film, NOT as good as The Amazing Spider-Man 1
","Pay no attention to the childish wannabe critics who are trying to lower the rating down. This movie certainly isn't perfect because it does have some strong points. The CGI and Props in this film are sinply beautiful and the acting is without a doubt 10/10. The only problem is that the plot is nowhere near as good as the first Amazing Spider-Man. There was no need for 3 villains. It seems Sony didn't learn their lesson from the disaster of a film which was Spider-Man 3. The Amazing Spider-Man was near perfect. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 however is just your average Spider-Man movie. Don't expect it to be the best one yet, cause it's not.",7,1,1,5 September 2018
1917," Just saw this movie yesterday in D-BOX! Wow!!!
","1917 is a brilliant World War I Movie directed by Sam Mendes. The action in this movie is about as real as it can possibly feel and level of emotion you experience is on the same level.1917 perfectly illustrates everything that can go wrong on the battlefield, and how much you can lose in just one day.This movie had me on the edge of my seat from about 10 mins in all the way until the end.Due yourself a favor and either watch this movie in IMAX or D-BOX and nothing else! This is a truly mesmerizing experience.",9,0,1,11 January 2020
Saw," What made the 'Torture Porn' Genre relevant!
","I don't know where to start. As someone who has seen classics like Alien, Jaws, Jurassic Park, The Dark Knight, etc. I can easily say that this is my all time favorite film. I have never seen a movie so beautifully written in my entire life. The acting is phenomenal and clever. I think they surely gave the audience what they asked for in Saw. The only people who don't like this movie are people who can't respect the torture porn genre. Don't let people predetermine your mind about this film and instead develop your own opinion. Saw is ABSOLUTELY worth the watch and I can say that without hesitation. That's seriously how amazing this movie is.",10,1,3,13 March 2018
Moon," I wanted to like it, but it failed
","This movie is just simply too boring. The story is very basic and not impressive. The plot twist in this movie is very confusing and is hard to pick up at first, but that's literally the only interesting part Moon has to offer. I've seen many people compare this movie to all time great space films like Gravity, Interstellar, and The Martian. After watching this movie I can easily say that Moon definitely doesn't compare to any of those movies, not even close. Personally, I consider this a rather unfavorable film and would not recommend it, but then again I suppose it could have been worse.",5,2,7,18 May 2019
