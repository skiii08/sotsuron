Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The hate is over done
","After rewatching the prequels I can't see why PTM is hated so much. Is it perfect? No! But most of the criticism for this film stems from Jar Jar...who isn't in every scene and is just a bit too goofy. Other then that it's a solid film. Good action, good affect, and a unique plot!",7,3,7,20 December 2019
Captain Marvel," Meh
","Fun action, an ok story, and some cool characters...except the titular character. This movie was not as exciting as most mcu films and Brie Larson just wasn't fun to watch. I'd put it down there between iron man 2 and thor dark world. 5.5-6/10, not worth seeing in theaters in my opinion.",5,2,3,8 March 2019
The King," A damn fine film but a bit bland at several points.
","I really enjoyed this film and I've been very happy with how Netflix has made another very accurate historical film. I won't repeat what everyone else has praised it for, and my only complaint is that sometimes I felt some of the characters were a bit bland. Like they wouldn't react to something like a real human would. MINOR SPOILER at one point a characters son dies in front of him yet he doesn't so much as flinch. Other than that I loved it.",8,1,5,2 November 2019
Joker," Not something you see everyday
","This film really knocks it out of the park. The acting, the story, the cinematography, the score...it's all great. This films isn't eye candy like Endgame, it's an in depth character study that shows how the joker is born. Be prepared to feel uncomfortable as this film touches on uncomfortable issues that we don't like to talk about. 10/10, a must see in theaters.",10,2,4,20 October 2019
