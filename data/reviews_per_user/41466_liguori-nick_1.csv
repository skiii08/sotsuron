Source Code," clarification of ending
","okay so i thought i would clear this up for most of you. the ending isn't about creating the alternate universes but what they are doing is changing the time line.at the end when the guy tells Dr. Rutledge (the inventor of source code) that the terrorist attack on the train has been stopped and he says 'one of these days the right crisis is going to rear its head and source code is going to have its moment in the sun' which means that the inventor doesn't really understand whats going on in reality source code always works every time without fail but they never remember that it works because when it does work and they attack is stopped they do not have start the source code program.that is that the text at the end is about the really Sean sends Goodwin the text telling her when they start the source code up to tell colter that he will be okay this is also why she is confused because in the real time line Sean figures out how to disarm the bomb, handcuffs the terrorist to the train, and calls he police (he knows all of this because of the source code from the time line that is portrayed throughout almost all of the movie) after that he walks off with his girlfriend (or friend w/e) which is why they never know he was the real one that actually saved everyonewhich kinda brings it into loop because now the attack is stopped they will wait till then next attack arises where they can use it, which they will and they will succeed again change the time line and not need to use source code till the next attack.in summary source code always changes the time line so basically it always works and they never have to use it.another way you could think of it is that colter from separate time lines gives 8 minutes of memories to people filled with information to stop terrorist attacks. the Sean on the train would suddenly have memories from a serperate time line that the train explodes so he had have the ability to stop it. this is what colter is doing to peoplepersonally what i would like to know is does Goodwin frequently receive texts from random numbers telling her to tell colter hes going to be okay when they start the program and that source code works better than they knowafter receiving many of these texts from random people who no way could know about the classified project she must eventually figure out that source code is always working because all terrorist attacks would stop completely and she would be receiving these texts every time the program worked and the time line was changed",10,14,24,31 August 2013
