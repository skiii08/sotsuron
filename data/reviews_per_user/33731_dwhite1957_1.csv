The Benchwarmers," Funny?????
","There wasn't anything remotely funny about this movie. Unless of course you find long drawn out farts in people's faces funny. Or you thing someone eating boogers is funny. Or you think midgets are inherently funny. Or you think that the same site gag (a bat being accidentally thrown or a gay man in a thong, etc...) over and over gets funny rather than tiring. I took my 10 year old son and a friend to this movie and his comment was 'it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.' Now keep in mind he normally thinks all of the above is funny (but, again he is 10)so that goes to show that even with the farts, boogers, midgets and gay man this movie sucks.",1,0,1,10 June 2006
