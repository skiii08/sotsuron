The Blair Witch Project," Some people
","It doesn't really suprise me that this film is getting so many bad reviews from members of IMDB. These people call the film; boring, not frightening or disturbing in the least, and just downright dumb. It really is funny because they were expecting to see the witch, to have nice special effects. They also complain about the way TBWP seems it's a 'home video', completely unprofessional. Really people, THAT WAS THE POINT!!! It wasn't made to look like a hollywood movie at all! And as we left the theater (I've seen it three times now) we talked about how people wouldn't like it because of it's non-hollywood style. And if you didn't think it was disturbing, or frightening in the least, you really need to get an imagination, and put yourself in the filmmakers shoes. So all've you are saying you wouldn't be freaked out if something like this happened to you? I know I would be! And I know when I went camping after seeing this movie I was very cautious! Also (SPOILERS AHEAD) the scene where Heather apologizes to everybody is the most powerful scene in movie history, period. I hope the academy gets smart and puts Heather Donahue and the movie up for an award, otherwise we're going to have more crap that's like Shakespear In Love winning again.To sum it all up The Blair Witch Project is the best film I've ever seen as well as a classic!",10,1,2,27 August 1999
