The Avengers," Proof That Bigger Can Be Better
","The Avengers definitely had the house riding on it. Marvel set up the film for success, releasing solo pictures of each character in the group with varying degrees of quality from pretty good (Iron Man) to terrible (Iron Man 2). Fortunately, the rest of those prequels were in the good to above average range, laying out a huge amount of hype for the granddaddy to outshine them all.On that level, the Avengers definitely does not disappoint. It is a leading candidate for the best Marvel movie thus far (the other two being X2 and X-Men: First Class), showcased by an excellent script and easy chemistry between the ensemble cast. It would probably be expected to think that Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is in a league by himself here but he is actually outshined by Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleson (Bruce Banner/Hulk and Loki, respectively).Ruffalo is spot on as Bruce Banner, bringing an easygoing nature to a role that was played with much more brooding by both Eric Bana and Edward Norton. The laid back-ness offers the yin to Hulk's destructive yang, adding needed context to the misunderstood hero's backstory.Hiddleson continues to impress as the troubled Loki, thirsty to drink vengeance against his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and willing to enslave Thor's beloved Earth to do so. Most movie adaptations of Marvel villains are pretty simple affairs, but Hiddleson wills viewers to fully understand the depth of his hatred and propensity for chaos.Chris Evans is fine as Captain America, although the fact that he plays the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four (another Marvel franchise) bothers me greatly. I'm sure there are other actors who can carry Cap's shield, so to speak. Samuel Jackson, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson reprise their roles as Nick Fury, Hawkeye, and Black Widow to round out the crew and add another layer of bad ass-ness to the film.The plot here is standard comic book fare: Loki has teamed with a group of alien baddies to steal the power of some sort of cosmic cube that Fury is hanging onto, and the Avengers need to stop him before the world goes to poop. It's not important to explain the story as much as it is to note that Joss Whedon is proving he is a master of the spectacular. Avengers is the type of summer movie the season is made for and fully worthy of the box office receipts it tallied.",8,2,6,3 June 2013
The Equalizer," The Return of the One Man War on Bad Guys
","The Equalizer is loosely based on the 80's TV show of the same name, but it might have more in common with the corny action movies of that era that featured one man armies against hordes of bad guys. Denzel Washington takes the title role as a mysterious ex government agent of some sort who is trying to live a life of normalcy. But when he befriends a prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz and she falls into trouble with her Russian mob pimps, he falls back to his old skill set to reap punishment on her accosters. And Washington's Equalizer ain't no punk b---h. Like the Stallones and Schwarzneggers of the aforementioned 80's films, Denzel is a wrecking ball of ridiculous force and wrath. But while those old 80s flicks lacked style and creativity, director Antoine Fuqua breaks out the tricks and flash of his growing repertoire and holds nothing back in the manner in which Washington dispatches baddies. While I raised an eyebrow at the ease in which a 60 year old Washington worked his way through his adversaries here, I was still entertained by a decent script and well shot action scenes.",7,1,2,4 January 2015
Skyfall," Double 0 Boring
","The 007 franchise has a recipe that is pretty simple in ingredients but has still been able to keep audiences buying tickets for over 50 years. You have a super villain, a girl (sometimes two), some gadgetry paired up with a beautiful automobile, and top tier chase and fight scenes that are the best in the business. Aside from minor variations on this formula, it is one that has not changed in half a century. For the most part, this has not been a bad thing. The James Bond series has spawned one of the best action films ever in Casino Royale and even the mediocre ones are enjoyable to watch. Most critics and fans alike will say that the Daniel Craig led phase of the Bond series is 1-2 with a grand slam in Casino Royale and a strike out with bases loaded in The Quantum of Solace (although I feel that is a little unfair on the latter). So now we have Skyfall at the plate and with Sam Mendes at the helm and Javier Bardem checking in as the bad guy, anticipation for a big score could be no higher.MI6 is in chaos. After Bond is accidentally shot by his colleague during a fight with a hit-man, he is presumed dead when his body is not located. His boss, M (Judi Dench), is facing heavy scrutiny and being pressured to retire by British Intelligence Chairman Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Shortly after an inquest into Bond's demise, M receives a taunting email from an unknown sender and then the offices of MI6 explode, killing many workers. Bond, who is actually hiding out and gathering his wits, learns of the attack and returns to London. Since he has already been declared deceased, he must pass some psychological and physical tests, all of which he fails. Nevertheless, M inserts him back in the field to search after her tormentor. The usual Bond type globetrotting detective work ensues which leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former MI6 operative turned freelance cyber terrorist. Silva has a very large bone to pick with M, and through that MI6 as a whole.Besides Craig, who could prove to supplant Sean Connery as the best Bond ever, Bardem is one the few good things Skyfall has going for it. This is no mere copy of Anton Chigurh, the hit-man from No Country For Old Men for whose role earned Bardem an Oscar. Silva is one of the most layered Bond villains in decades and the story of him going bad fits well within the 007 universe. But there is some ridiculousness in his skill as a hacker, and it is one of the many problems with Skyfall's plot.The ongoing worry with Bond movies is directors must know when something is too over the top when crafting the action that is the backbone of the franchise. Do too much and risk jumping the shark. Do too little and audiences are underwhelmed. Mendes somehow manages both in the same film. Silva's character's issue is that he is too much of a genius, too clever for the sake of the story. We are expected to believe that he has no problem hacking into M's personal email and computer with ease and later into MI6's entire system. He masterminds an escape from custody that is so reliant on perfect timing that it is too much too swallow, even for a Bond movie. The essence of a great villain is that he is able to overcome adversity by outthinking the good guys. But here, the good guys are so inept that Silva's feats neither impress nor seem possible.The other big problem with Skyfall is the mediocrity of the chase and fight scenes. Mendes shoots a beautiful film, no doubt, and there is a fight between Bond and a baddie on top of a Shanghai skyscraper that is nothing short of gorgeous. But the rest of the action has an uninspired feel to it. There are no wow moments and one can't help but feel like you have seen these shootouts many times before.The relationship between M and Bond is given more story here than in any movie of the series that I can remember. I understand the reasoning but it is all done with such a heavy hand that it comes off as melodramatic. And that's really the whole gist of what is wrong here. Mendes has attempted to make Skyfall the most character driven Bond movie ever but in the end I didn't want to ride to where these characters were being driven to.",4,5,11,26 July 2013
World War Z," Worth Every Penny of its Budget
","Rooting against big budgeted Hollywood excesses is an on and off again pastime for me. While I enjoy a summer blockbuster just as much as anyone when they are good (see The Avengers), I can't help but snicker when I see a terrible idea go down in flames (see the Lone Ranger).And so was the expectation with World War Z, director Marc Forster's adaptation of the critically acclaimed Max Brooks' novel. The book was clever in that it was written like a historical retelling of a real event, the event here being the zombie apocalypse. Forster and screenwriter Matthew Carnahan shun most of Brook's narrative style, giving the author's witty concept the Hollywood makeover. It should be noted that World War Z had one of the more troubled production phases in recent film history with rumors circulating that its budget had skyrocketed to as much as $400 million (In reality, it was more in the $200-$250 million range). Recasting, script rewrites, and director-star squabbles were all in the mix which usually is a recipe for disaster come release time. But not only has WWZ defied odds by being a runaway hit looking now to eventually turn a profit, it is also one of the most expertly concocted thrillers in recent memory.Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator who is enjoying retirement playing Mr. Mom with his wife and two children. After he and his family narrowly escape the onslaught of the zombie outbreak in downtown Philadelphia, they eventually are whisked to safety aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier where Gerry is recruited by his old U.N. boss to assist in tracking down the outbreak's source. Lane then begins what will eventually become a globetrotting investigation where he and crew face the deadliness of the infection head on in Korea, Israel, and England.Pitt is rolling into his middle age roles nicely. He plays Lane as a low key, slick government flatfoot whose previous experience in crappy situations helps keep him alive in the madness here. And it is pretty much his show the whole way through. He is aided throughout the film by different groups of people with little development of any of these side characters. It is a small drawback and the non stop thrill ride of the film's events more than make up for it.Forster creates sequence after sequence here that one ups the previous one on the nail biting meter. Brook's zombies are not your slump around, Walking Dead type zombies. As savage as they were in 28 Days Later, the creatures here are even more beastly in their speed and brutality. Forster borrows some from Danny Boyle's masterpiece early on but finds his own narrative as WWZ moves forward. From an airplane landing on a pitch black military landing strip to an escape from an over ran safety compound in the middle of the day, Forster keeps viewers glued to the screen no matter where the setting is. The film culminates in a masterfully paced final act in which Pitt and friends zero in on possible relief for the catastrophic epidemic.WWZ is smart while not being pretentious and exciting without being outrageous. It is everything one can want in a summer blockbuster and hopefully the beginning of an excellent franchise.",9,4,8,14 July 2013
Mama," Ehhhh....Yawn
","Mama focuses on two small girls who are left in a cabin after their troubled father is killed by a malevolent spirit. Fast forward five years where the father's brother Lucas still has search parties trying to locate the missing girls. When one of the parties stumbles across the cabin where the girls have been holed up, they discover the children who are now in a feral state. The pair are brought to be examined by a psychiatrist, and eventually a judge rules they can be ordered to the care of Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Once the children are moved in, it becomes noticeable that they have brought something sinister with them from that cabin in the woods.Sometimes when you read the premise of a horror movie on paper, they sound pretty ridiculous. So as I write these next few sentences on the plot of Mama, I can understand how over the top the movie sounds. Without giving too much away, the spirit is actually what has taken care of the girls for the last five years while they were missing. She is now a maternal figure of sorts and jealous of anyone else who has come into their lives. Reading that, I know it all sounds outrageous, and it is. But it actually works in the context of the movie. What doesn't work is the ho hum pace set by half hearted scares that we have seen before in movies just as bland as this one. These are what would make Mama an around average horror flick. What makes it a bad watch is the moronic ending to close all the averageness. Viewers under 15 may not roll their eyes during Mama's final 20 minutes, but anyone over that age bracket is in for sure disappointment.",4,0,2,25 July 2013
The Wolverine," As Solid As Adamantium Claws
","It has been some time since the events of X-Men: The Last Stand. Logan (Hugh Jackman), the honorable yet brutal warrior of the mutant super team, has grown disenchanted with life and is living in the wilderness of Canada. Haunted by memories of his lost love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the loner is a victim of his own immortality. He has all the time in the world, but nothing left to live for.That is until Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a messenger from a man he once saved many years before named Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) , tracks him down with a luring proposition. Yashida , now a technology mogul, is nearing the end of his life. He claims that before he passes, he wishes to grant Logan the gift of mortality in exchange for saving his life so many years ago.Of course, everything is not as it seems. And it is not long before Logan is caught up in family politics involving Yashida's heirs: fiery son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada) and captivating granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamato). After Yakuza goons make an attempt to kidnap Mariko, Logan rescues her and finds new purpose in keeping her protected. As they camp out in hiding, the two fall for each other and he is able to find relief in confessing his past to her. But peace does not last for long as Mariko is eventually snatched away from him, leading the Wolverine to give chase and track her down by any means necessary.The thing that makes The Wolverine work on so many levels is its maturity. Christopher Nolan showed with his Batman trilogy that superhero movies could be loyal to the sometimes serious tone of comics but still be accessible to the masses. Movies based on Marvel characters for the most part have not followed suit. While entertaining, the Marvel movies (the Punishers being the exception) have been light hearted affairs that focus more on action and laughs than story or character development. Logan, however, is a serious character with grown up problems who deserves a script to reflect that. Director James Mangold and Jackman have a done a solid job in bringing that angst to the screen. The Frank Miller and Chris Claremont penned story arc that Mangold and his crew of writers have borrowed from for this movie is considered to be one of the best in Wolverine canon. In fact, the first two-thirds of The Wolverine are so good at developing the mutant's character, that viewers do not even notice the lack of constant action scenes that are so prevalent in superhero films today. It is a testament to Jackman's now effortless portrayal of the troubled protagonist and also to Mangold's ability to match the atmosphere of the dark content of early Wolverine comics.This is not to say that The Wolverine lacks explosiveness. There is just enough fighting and chases throughout those aforementioned first two-thirds, and a little too much of it in the final act. It is in the final act where Mangold slips a little, digressing back into a standard Marvel piece heavy on smoke and mirrors instead of genuine substance. But Marvel's smoke and mirrors still outdazzle most of its competition on any given movie night and audiences will not be let down here.",8,44,91,29 July 2013
