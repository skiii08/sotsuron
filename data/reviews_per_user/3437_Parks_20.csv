Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force Is Not Strong In this One
","Star Wars - The Phantom MenaceThings to like about the original Star Wars trilogy:1.  Simple yet imaginative plot. 2.  Interesting and engaging characters. 3.  Great special effects.Things to like about The Phantom Menace:1.  Great special effects.I mean, COME ON!!  The original movies were pretty stupid, I have to admit, but they were fun-stupid.  The new film is just DULL.And the plot is a big problem.  For a start we have a 'Trade Federation'. This is not nearly as scary as an 'Evil Empire', I'm sorry but it just isn't.  'Yikes!  Here come the delegates from the Evil Trade Federation!!!' See?!?  It just doesn't work.  It's like 'Beware the dreaded Agriculture Commission!!' or something.  The plot is supposed to be for kids, but unfortunately it seems to have quite a high 'Daddy?  Who are they/What's going on?' quotient.  Certainly the kids in the audience with me had no idea.  Especially as to who Queen Amidala actually was (towards the end it was a bit like that scene from 'Spartacus' - 'I'm Queen Amidala', 'No I'M Queen Amidala!!' etc etc...)Then we have the characters.  Or rather we don't because NO-ONE in this film HAS any character.I think the problem is that George Lucas thinks that when people become Learned and Wise they also become members of the Incredibly Boring Society. Kind of like Luke Skywalker in 'Return of the Jedi'.  When Luke became a Jedi knight he suddenly became 'Enigmatic' for which we can read 'Dull and Awful'.  I thought this was merely down to bad acting on Mark Hamill's part in Jedi, but no - because Liam and Ewan are JUST as 'Enigmatic' in this new film.  At certain parts in the movie I thought I spotted Ewan's natural exuberance bubbling over, but at those points George obviously yelled 'Cut!!!' and poked Ewan with his directorial cattle prod.  The end result is that both actors look like they have had their charisma surgically removed.Then there's Queen Amidala.  She is a very different kind of royalty to Princess Leia who was kind of spunky.  Amidala is 'Regal'.  Unfortunately George ALSO equates 'Regal' with 'Dull and Awful'.  Also she seems to have gone to the same finishing school as Queen Elizabeth and as such delivers all her lines with the same passion.Then we have the kid.  Having small children in films is always a dangerous move.  It's not their fault, they are just by nature irritating creatures who can't act (with the exception of Bart Simpson).  Eventually CGI will have improved to the state where all children will be played by far more charismatic special effects, but for the moment George was lumbered with an Annakin Skywalker with the emotional range of a turnip.  See the scene where he was separated from his mother?  Now if he had been a NORMAL child, he would have done that whole chest-heaving-snot-coming-out-of-the-nose-bawling thing.  But he doesn't.  He didn't even look close to being dischuffed, the scene was completely bungled.  Yes, yes, I know he's not a normal child - he's got a high medichlorien count or something (I think it's a bit like cholesterol) and he's causing a 'divergence in the force' - but all the same, it's hard to care for young Anni.On to Jar-Jar.  A lot of people hate this character, and I was surprised I didn't really.  It's not that he isn't annoying, just that he isn't unbearable either.  I mean, C3PO was a lot worse.  (I have my own theories as to what the 'PO' in his name stands for).  Jar-jar is there for the kiddies, and as such probably does quite a good job.Is there any point spending much time on Darth Maul?  I don't think so. George Lucas didn't.The main problem with this movie is that if the characters are not interesting, we don't really care about them.  If we don't care about them, we don't really care when they are in danger.  If we don't care when they are in danger there is no sense of relief when things work out.  There is no emotional wallop in this movie like there was in 'Jedi' or 'Star Wars' when the Death Stars blew up.  The only emotional release I felt was when the credits rolled and I knew FINALLY that the thing was over.p.s.  Did I mention the special effects?  They're ever so impressive.",4,2,7,19 August 1999
It," Stephen King finally captured on screen
","IT is not my favourite adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Obviously, that would be 'Shawshank'. But there's something about IT that feels more authentically Stephen King than any of the other adaptations I've seen (and I've seen a LOT - I've even seen 'Firestarter' and King's performance as Jordy Verrill).This is not to say that it is wholly faithful to the novel. It is not, and with good reason. There are some parts of IT-novel that would never work on screen. Let's just say that the turtle only gets a cameo role as a piece of Lego in this film and quite right too.But where the film seems to capture the strengths of King is in warping reality, just a little. Venturing into the basement and seeing something that might be eyes, glowing in the dark. Passing by a creepy picture every day and trying to NOT look at it... just in case...These are the experiences we've all had - but in King's world the thing you know that CAN'T happen sometimes does. And sometimes those eyes in the dark look right back at you.Director Muschietti captures this spot-on. Also King's ability to take more prosaic horrors like school bullies or overly-affectionate fathers and add them to the palette. I could hear the audience around me tense up whenever Mr. Marsh was on screen.The reason it works so well is that the film takes the time to develop (most) of the child characters well. Unfortunately, a film's running time is a tyrannical thing so Stanley and Mike lose out. In Stanley's case, I think this might be a problem for chapter 2. In Mike's case, I didn't mind so much - the acting in this film is uniformly good except in the case of the actor who plays that part. I'm sorry, but he was wooden in comparison to the rest of the Losers.So this is not by any means a perfect film, but I can see why it has been so spectacularly successful. It's a terrific ghost-train ride. If you go in with the right frame of mind it will make laugh, jump and be enthralled.IT is definitely NOT the scariest film ever made though. Go in with that expectation and you will be disappointed. This is a film that wants to entertain as much as scare - it's often as funny as it is spooky.But IT does have one ace up its sleeve - the nightmarish creation that is Pennywise. We all have a built-in suspicion of the creature who smiles too wide, whose friendly grin so easily becomes a snarl, a rictus of bared teeth. King didn't create our shared fear of clowns, he just built on it. His Pennywise is a creature that will be hard to forget, and I even though I didn't feel that scared during the film, I felt my mind going back to him for a few days after I saw it. Bill Skarsgard gives an amazing performance as a being not quite in its own skin, and the subtle special effects merely emphasise his strangeness.I'm looking forward to IT Chapter 2 much more than I ever expected. This is a far better film than I thought it would be. But I'm also hoping that Chapter 2 will really take the gloves off and try to terrify in a way that Chapter 1 shied away from. Chapter 1 did feel a little like an R rated kid's film, or 'Stranger Things' with a more meaningful monster. I hope that in Chapter 2, the fears are fully-grown. But this will do nicely for now.",8,3,6,28 September 2017
Train to Busan," Action-Packed Zombies - Heavy-Handed Storyline
","There are good and bad things about 'Train to Busan'. It's a claustrophobic zombie movie that makes the most of having its protagonists trapped on a speeding train with a horde of ravenous zombies.It doesn't milk that situation of being trapped quite as effectively as 'REC' but the action sequences are spectacular and the zombie attacks are very well-staged.Other reviewers have praised the social satire element of the film. Hmm... I found it might have worked better if it were not laid on with a trowel. The 'douche' fund-manager, the evil executive who just NEVER MISSES an opportunity to screw someone over. I found it painfully sentimental at times and 'Yes, I get it' obvious at others.At this moment in history, when the rich and powerful are turning us against each other in order to further their own interests we do need films with messages like this. And on the whole I enjoyed 'Train to Busan' more than I didn't. But if there is to be remake, I do hope the film-makers allow for a little more subtlety in there.",6,1,5,4 February 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Disney Do What Lucas Could Not
","There were so many negative comments about Disneyfication of the Star Wars universe - making it more child-friendly, more merchandise- driven, more bland, more blah, more nothing.This film feels like a one-fingered salute to all of that criticism.The fact is that 'Rogue One' is a brave experiment and a film that really steps away from the tone - if not the setting - of Star Wars in a way no other film in the franchise has dared. It's the boldest move since 'The Empire Strikes Back'.Feeling more like 'Where Eagles Dare' or 'The Dirty Dozen' in space, this film paints a more complex picture of the rebellion. Not a united group of like-minded, high-minded freedom fighters, but a group of zealots with mixed motivations, underhand methods and no lofty ambitions.Felicity Jones makes an excellent heroine, without Jedi powers or especially strong with the Force, just with a desire to reunite with her father (Mads Mikkelson) whose existence manages to explain really neatly a major plot point in 'A New Hope'. To save her father, Jones' character has to team up with a disparate group of rebels and from there it's an action-packed race against time to once again thwart the Evil Empire.Is it entirely successful? I think so. I think it sets out what it intended to do, which is make a war movie in space, complete with 'Battle of Britain' style dogfights and 'The Dirty Dozen' style battles. I've read criticisms that the cast isn't as charismatic as the original trio of stars - that's probably fair. But they compare favourably to the new leads (Ridley, Boyega and Isaac) and they blow Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman out of the water. But a note of warning - if the film fails it is because this is in no way a movie for kids. The characers and settings aren't so colourful. Parts of it look like footage from Beirut in the 80's. Plus, it strikes the bleakest end note since 'Empire' and that may be unsatisfying for those expecting happy endings from Star Wars movies. It's a brave move, a most un-Disney move, and I hope that Disney continues to make non-Star Wars films in the Star Wars universe.",9,5,15,15 December 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," Taika Waititi Does It Again
","'Thor: Ragnarok' is be the best time I've had at the cinema in a long time. And the most enjoyable superhero film I've yet seen.Possibly what makes this even more delightful is how unexpected it is. Cards on the table. Prior to this film, Thor was boring. I have seen 'Thor: The Dark World' twice. I still can't really remember what it was about.And here's where Taika Waititi's talent shines through. We hear a lot about those directors who make 'beautiful' films. And here I'm mainly thinking of Ridley Scott and Zack Snyder who make great-looking films, but seem to feel that characterisation and motivation just aren't important.But Taika Waititi appears to be a director who understands that it's characters who drive a great story. Here, he allows the actors room to find their characters through improvisation. 'Thor: Ragnarok' finally allowed Chris Hemsworth to show us that Thor is more than a god-like superhero with a firm jaw, and it pays off in spades.But it's not just Hemsworth who benefits from Waititi's direction. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is so stuffed full of great performances you'll walk out of the cinema arguing over who was your favourite character. The 'new & improved' Hulk? Cate Blanchett clearly having great fun at the Goddess of Death? The dazed & confused Bruce Banner? Amazingly enough, that's just the start of it. Often the stars of the film are the new side-characters. Valkyrie is absolutely terrific, Scourge has a believable journey; Korg is a hoot and the banter between Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster and the wonderful Rachel House as his guard is a joy.But focusing on Waititi's directorial strength as an actor's director isn't to diminish the visual style of the film either. Some of the scenes - most notably the Valkyrie attack on Hela are stunning. And the scenes on Siccar take the retro-cool 1970's aesthetic of James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and runs even further with it.Finally, the story is genuinely satisfying with an ending that doesn't rely on constant bashing and brute force winning the day. There's actually a pretty smart resolution at work here, involving a major sacrifice.'Thor 3' flies in the face of those who predict the bursting of the superhero bubble. This film opens so many doors I can't wait for Marvel and DC to keep on exploring new ways to tell these stories.",9,2,10,17 November 2017
The Hateful Eight," Another Case of Tarantino Bloat
","Just as with 'Inglorious Basterds' I can't help but be frustrated by 'The Hateful Eight'. It's like I can almost see a good 90 minute film in here, struggling to get out. Unfortunately, it's buried under a 3 hour bloatfest.The story, of a bounty hunter trapped in a cabin with his $10,000 dollar captive (brilliantly played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) has some promise. Despite some claims, it is not really a whodunnit in the sense that there is no way of figuring out who's doing what. It's more of a character piece, allowing the actors to explore attitudes in America following the cataclysm of the Civil War.And it's here where the movie shines as Tarantino rips the scab off the problem with race relations in the US from slavery to Black Lives Matter and makes us look at it. However, it's not exactly succinct - or even coherent. It's just grim, mean-spirited rhetoric that goes on and on and on long past the time when the point was made.The actors are good, the direction is excellent but oh dear god that script needs a pair of shears taking to it. Why brevity continues to elude Tarantino is a mystery to me as his first, best movie came in at a brisk 100 minutes. He really needs to work on a low budget again.",3,14,29,22 January 2016
Suicide Squad," Why Do They Keep Dropping The Ball?
","So look, it's not as bad as BvS. For two reasons:a) No pointless pseudo-philosophical claptrap about gods and mortals that doesn't actually mean anythingb) No Jesse Eisenberg doing his Joker-Without-Makeup bitAnd there are good things in this film. There are good actors in it. There are no awful actors (hi Jesse!) in it. The idea is unusual and interesting. There's quite a lot of action. But yet... it falls short of expectations. It's frustrating. Just when you want it to fly, it flounders. The key issue is that I really didn't care about anyone but Deadshot. Harley is fun, but her romance with Mr. J is under-written and unconvincing. So she really only comes across as nutty and wanton which is hard to care about.To put this in perspective, I cared a lot more and actually liked Harley in the animated series. It's not Margot Robbie's fault. She's actually terrific and almost pulls it off. But to get her over the line she needed a more fleshed out relationship with the Joker. And a better Joker. I'm not sure Jared Leto or the people who wrote this movie got the Joker - or why Harley needs him. In this movie, he never comes across as anything but a sadistic psycho - which he is - but in other incarnations he also has a brilliantly manipulative and devious side - appearing vulnerable or in need of help to suck in his victims just before he slips in the knife. It's not hard - we've seen it in previous versions of this character. But not here. Harley just loves him because she does. End of. Keep up. It's not very satisfying.The plot is pretty flimsy, but I can get over that. Marvel have done flimsier but get away with it because they seem to understand how to make audiences care about characters. I'm not saying DC are incapable of this. I really hope they up their game and learn a few lessons from Feige. But based on the three DCEU movies thus far, they'd better start studying his playbook hard. I know 'Suicide Squad' and 'BvS' made a lot of money but so do 'Transformers' movies and 'Suicide Squad' is closer in spirit to those sorts of films than Marvel right now.",5,1,2,19 November 2016
Baby Driver," Slight and Insubstantial
","I'm a bit perplexed by the ecstatic reviews. Perhaps it's just that 'Baby Driver' is different compared to Marvel Movie #21 or Generic CGI Robot Saga #5.Either way, the strengths of the film seem to be summarised as follows:Cool soundtrack. Great editing. Some mildly funny lines. Some great car chases. Kevin Spacey is always great in everything. Except maybe 'Nine Lives'.I'm struggling to say more about it than that. It was pleasant, it passed the time. I didn't get bored. But I'm struggling to understand the 10 star reviews which bypass the spit-through characterisation and the repetitive story (it's essentially just three car-chases interspersed with a very flimsy plot). The romance between the two leads is pleasant enough, but it is pretty by-the-numbers teen stuff.In the last third of the film it falls apart completely. The motivations of certain characters start to make no sense other than they move the plot to where it needs to go for the next set-piece. I'm honestly still trying to figure out why Kevin Spacey's character acted as he did at the end. So you see what I mean? It's a decent film. I'd buy the soundtrack, and watch it on DVD. But I suspect if it didn't have the name Edgar Wright on the credits you could probably reduce its IMDb rating by about a third.And now that I think about it... Marvel Sequel #21 probably had more depth to it. And Guardians of the Galaxy probably had the better soundtrack too.",5,14,30,3 July 2017
Rocky IV," 80's Time Capsule
","Here's a fun game; if you had to choose films to show to millennials to explain the 80's, what would you pick? The serious minded amongst you might go for Wall Street or if you wanted to illustrate how Vietnam stilled loomed in the American psyche you could go for Platoon. Cold War hysteria could be summed up by The Day After or WarGames. But if it's pop culture you're after, then you might choose a John Hughes film, or if you wanted to show how MTV culture took over then you might go for Flashdance.But maybe the best choice would be Rocky IV which squishes together all of the above in just 90 minutes. PLUS it features a talking robot and a pulsing soundtrack of 80's power rock.In the film, Rocky fights for World Peace by attempting to beat the living snot out of an evil Russian. No, don't laugh, just 6 years after this film was released, the Soviet Union fell. Coincidence? I think not.The film itself is literally one cliche after another, accompanied by endless montages. And yet it is still somehow lovable. Possibly because it IS so familiar, so formulaic, so flashy and so desperate to work its audience into a frenzy.In the end, while you will find yourself cringing at the dialogue, it's hard not to get caught up in it all. I defy even a hardened cynic from enjoying the movie.But seriously, what the heck is it with that talking robot? I've seen this film about a dozen times and have no idea what the point of it is. Poor Burt Young, his character went from being a serious Pauly to being a stooge for a glorified vacuum cleaner.",6,0,1,23 August 2019
Dunkirk," Dunkirk or 'Christopher Nolan Wants To Hit You Around The Head With a Bat'
","There's not much said in 'Dunkirk' for a lot of the time. Occasionally, officers heave into view for some handy bits of exposition, but mostly this is a film where the soundtrack consists of tortured metal grinding, diving bombers screaming, engines roaring and Hans Zimmer's score.And what a score it is. More industrial BWAAAMPS and thuds, as if the sounds of battle were not horrific enough.It's to make the point that war is hell. I get that. Although I've also come to the conclusion that war could potentially be worse if it was accompanied by a Hans Zimmer score.The story mainly consists of one event that took place during the Dunkirk evacuation, seen from three different points of view, that you then see three times during the movie. Yes, playing around with a non-traditional narrative structure is cool and clever. But it's also kind of pointless in a film like this.I mean, we in the audience sit there, potentially in suspense - will the thing that we've seen happen twice before in the movie happen again the third time?? Well, of course it will. Suspense gone. Patience running thin.The movie ends abruptly on a note of patriotism. Nothing wrong with that. But hearing Churchill quoted as Elgar swells isn't exactly subtle is it? But Christopher Nolan seems to have lost touch with subtlety. He wants his audience bludgeoned, beaten, BWAAAAAMP'ed into submission. I think I'll stick with David Lean.",4,9,23,22 July 2017
Insidious," Drag Me Back To Hell Again
","Insidious is a magpie of a horror movie that steals ideas from other classics and weaves them together to make a fun movie - even if it will seem familiar to any horror movie fan.The opening is J-horror-ish with The Grudge-ey type spooks inhabiting the house of a young family coping with the fact that one of their children has gone into an inexplicable coma. We then move to 'Poltergeist' territory as the family brings in kooky help to help rid them of the presence in their home and finally, the film evokes 'Nightmare on Elm Street' in the last (and weakest) part of the film as those things which lurked in the shadows are finally exposed (and are frankly kind of disappointing).But even with all these influences, the film it reminded me of most is Sam Raimi's 'Drag Me To Hell' another movie that threw shock after scare at the viewers, contrasting eerie quiet with LOUD in an effort to lift the audience of its seat in unison. And just like DMTH, the impact is spoiled a little by a 'twist' you will have predicted easily unless you have never seen a movie before everIt's this over-familiarity that stops this movie from being more than a scary ride. It is a fun ride while it lasts but once it's over it will soon be forgotten.",6,1,3,29 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ignore The Disinformation
","Never in my experience have I come across a more concerted disinformation campaign by a small core of obsessive fans.Every regular cinema-goer I have asked has told me this film is a good Star Wars movie, with enjoyable characters, twists and action. But after reading the reviews on this site, I actually wondered if I should skip this film at the cinema. I'm so glad I didn't.Just as when The Force Awakens premiered there seem to be a small but incredibly vocal bunch of Star Wars fanatics who are incredibly angry that the series has not moved in the direction their own fan-fiction and are unable to see beyond that. The Last Jedi's story and script is a refreshing take on Star Wars. Kylo Ren is easily the most interesting and complex villain since Darth Vader, and not some pantomime villain like Christopher Lee or Iain McDiarmid. The action is thrilling and inventive and the humour in this film is not heavy-handed.There are the usual flaws in Star Wars films - it's marketing-heavy (let's not forget that George Lucas created this franchise with marketing in mind). It has to work really hard to explain its own mythology (George Lucas hadn't thought it through when he wrote part IV - he didn't even know it WAS part IV at the time). And there are lots of exposition-heavy scenes to explain why it's so urgent we need to get to X to obtain Y etc etc. But actually, in comparison to previous Star Wars movies, these flaws are mostly kept to a minimum. And there's a nice subtext in this film about how the Force belongs to everyone, not just a select few with a high midichorien count. Whatever the heck THAT is.In short, the one and two star reviews of this film are an absolute disgrace. This is an enjoyable, exciting movie. It does NOT contain the worst lines (that would be part 2) it does NOT contain stupid plot holes (that would be part 3) it does not contain cloying childish humour (that would be part 6).If you're able to view Star Wars films as just that - films - and not scripture then you will likely enjoy this movie.",8,1,4,3 January 2018
Jurassic World," Great Fun - Don't Think About The Subtext...
","I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Jurassic Park - which is practically a remake of the original in terms of storyline, but manages to re-energise the series by having likable leads and a genuinely scary monster.The plot is by-the-numbers for a monster film. Tree-hugging animal lovers talk about animals, while evil corporate types talk about assets. As a bonus, we've also got an oily Vince D'Onofrio muttering about using the beasts for military purposes. I think we know who's going to make it and who's going to end up as dino-snax.But I forgive it that, for the spectacle and the verve of the piece. I even forgive it for wasting Irrfan Khan, my favourite Bollywood actor.What's harder to stomach is the not-so-subtle message that women who don't take care of kids aren't proper women. Dudes can get away with this sort of behaviour but Bryce Dallas Howard's character (and her assistant) clearly have something wrong with them for not going all dewey and matronly when kids show up. Even the mother (Judy Greer, who seems to be making a career as put-upon mom in films lately) is shown as letting down the side by working. Hey, where's dad in all this? Funnily enough, no-one mentions how he neglects his kids by daring to have a job.It's a bit mid-1970's in terms of attitude is what I'm saying. But - sigh - I'll overlook that too. You can think too much about these things. Howard is actually pretty good in the movie, Chris Pratt is great and the raptors are just adorable. The kids aren't too annoying. I'm not fond of kids in films. I suspect if I was in a Jurassic Park film I'd get eaten in the first 10 minutes for admitting that.",8,1,3,26 December 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Taxi To The Revisionist Side
","So let's deal with the torture first, because that seems to be what everyone is talking about. The scenes depicted in this movie should not be shocking to anyone who has been watching the news for the past 8 years. If anything they are quite mild compared to what you might see in an average episode of 'Criminal Minds'. What some have found shocking is the claim that it was torture that 'found' Osama. Again, this has been in the news for over a year now - but there are things to consider - a) Kathryn Bigelow's movie is based upon the CIA version of events so take from that what you like. b) The US has been more successful in taking out al Qaeda targets after torture was removed as an option than it was under Bush/Cheney. (Google it if you don't believe me). c) We see a successful interrogation at Bagram. We don't see any interrogations of innocent dudes who also ended up tied to the ceiling there (see documentary 'Taxi To The Dark Side').So my feeling is, if you go in accepting the movie as unexpurgated truth, you're a bit daft. But then I'd say that about all movies anyway. Moving on.As drama, it is semi-successful. The issue here is that the subject matter is pretty dry for the first 3/4 of the story. People mostly sit in rooms discussing leads, politics and techniques. In an attempt to humanise the story and draw us in, we are given the character of Maya to follow. She's a young CIA agent who becomes obsessed with finding Abu Ahmed, Bin Laden's courier. But is he still alive? Does he even exist? He's so shadowy her superiors think not and we follow her frustration over the years as other leads are followed to no avail.I think the reason this part of the movie felt a bit dry to me was that essentially it was covering documentary territory and the character of Maya is so one-note (driven and dedicated) that it's hard to find an emotional foothold in the film. Compare it to the more emotive 'Argo' and it's nowhere near as compelling. But then we reach the last act. The assault on Osama's compound. It's brilliantly staged and, given that we know how it ends, incredibly tense. The whole audience was holding their breath the whole way.So I was glad I saw 'Zero Dark Thirty'. It is a good film and worth seeing. Is it 'Best Film Oscar' material? I think so - but for me 'Argo' & 'The Sessions' are much more satisfying films.",7,2,5,27 January 2013
Dark Shadows," In Defence of the Dark
","Having just read page after page of negative reviews, I thought it necessary to add this - DARK SHADOWS IS A LOT OF FUN!It's a campy, affectionate adaptation of a hammy horror soap from the 1970's. Granted, Johnny Depp is not Jonathan Frid, and the script never even attempts to give him that role. His Barnabbas is not the tortured monster of Dan Curtis' series, but a fish-out-of-water 18th century dude having trouble coping with 70's grooviness. Fans of the TV show may consider this a cop-out, but there's still a lot to enjoy.The supporting cast is uniformly fun - from Michelle Pfeiffer pulling faces at the camera to Johnny Lee Miller as the stuffy, twitchy Roger. The romance between Vicky & Barnabbas is hardly present in the film, but that's because Eva Green dominates as Angeline - and she's absolutely terrific as a demented, lovestruck witch.I think a big part of the issue people have with this film is that they were expecting a bit more darkness and a lot less froth from Burton. So try this - pretend you are going to see 'Robert Zemeckis' Dark Shadows' instead. It'll give you a better idea of what to expect and if you just let go of your preconceptions you'll find yourself giggling through this as much as I did.",8,1,4,5 May 2013
Prometheus," Makes AVP Requiem Look Good
","It's not just the anticipation that explains my disappointment in this film. It's the contempt the film-makers have shown their audience in presenting this half-baked, pseudo-philosophical nonsense to the public that makes me angry. The plot - such as it is - is stolen mainly from an X-Files long-running story-arc, shoehorned together with a bit of Van Daniken stuff from AVP, plus some gore/squish scenes to remind us that this is supposed to be a 'horror' film. But remember how tense and mysterious the original 'Alien' movie was? In which we couldn't be sure how the alien would behave because - well - it was an alien? Here, the potential mystery that could have been exploited is gone. We get tentacles, we get goop - lots of it - and we get lots of unconnected, pointless scenes of nastiness that contain no tension, no sense of claustrophobia, no horror. It's a 'so what' of a horror movie.Screenwriter David Lindeloff tries to fill the void by reminding us this is a 'deep' film. It's about the search for god, don't you know. But as Lindeloff demonstrated in 'Lost' he's better at promising to deliver than actually delivering. We get some trite rubbish explaining that god isn't necessarily who we want him to be. Whoop.Then there are the characters. Cardboard cut-outs compared to the rounded characters created by Dan O'Bannon. Charlize is given nothing to do except be 'icy' for no good reason. But undoubtedly the worst is David the android (no spoiler). He compares poorly to Ash and Bishop from the previous movies. Those androids were cool, logical and unemotional (as you'd expect). Here, for some reason, David seems to have been programmed as 'snippy and supercilious' - prone to making sly digs at his human colleagues. He seems to resent the emotions which he is not supposed to have (other than 'resentment' apparently). They even trot out that old android cliché, the 'Pinocchio' reference. It's painful.On the plus side, a lot of Prometheus is quite pretty. But it just demonstrates that Ridley Scott's movies can only ever be as good as the screenplays that inspire them.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Get Angry. We Deserve Better.
","I'm sick of reading apologetic reviews for this film of the 'If you can just get through the bad stuff, the rest of it is AMAZING' ilk.We shouldn't have to endure dialogue this bad, acting this awful and plotting this lazy to get to the good stuff. Let's take a few examples:<ul><li>Cavill has zero chemistry with Adams. None. The scene where he leaps into the bath with her is so awkward it's embarrassing.</li></ul><ul><li>And why is Amy Adams in the bath anyway? It's hardly a playful scene - she's talking about death and responsibility. I can only think it's played that way for 'Phwoar! Amy Adams in the bath!' reasons.</li></ul><ul><li>People in this film don't 'do' motivation. Superman turns on Batman for being a vigilante above the law. Which he is too. The public turns on Superman because of crimes they KNOW were committed by other people. Lex turns on Superman because... well, I'm still not sure about that.</li></ul><ul><li>Batman, the World's Greatest Detective - acts like an idiot for most of the film. Despite all evidence pointing at Lex, he allows himself to be manipulated into fighting Superman. Why didn't he use his detection skills on 'Who sent those notes?' and 'Who blew up the Senator?' and 'Hey, why does Lex want all that Kryptonite anyway?'</li></ul><ul><li>Batman is also kind of a sadist. No, I'm not complaining about the Bat-brand, I can live with that. But he takes his time toying with Superman. I'm not sure why. Again, motivation issues.</li></ul><ul><li>I don't actually have a massive problem with Superman &amp; Batman killing people. Although you have to admit, it makes you wonder how Lex &amp; The Joker are still alive. But this movie doesn't care about plot holes. I believe there's actually a plot 'black hole' at the centre of this film, sucking in all logic.</li></ul><ul><li>Mmm! I'm not sure I can entirely blame - mmm! - Jesse Eisenberg for Lex. I mean how can you deliver lines as embarrassingly bad as these without sounding like a complete idiot? Yet no character in the film ever comments on the fact that he acts like the guy on the bus you see muttering to himself. It can't be his wealth. I know Lex is a billionaire, but then again so is Donald Drumpf and people call him crazy all the time.</li></ul><ul><li>Plus 'crazy' isn't the same as 'scary'. There's no menace, no sense of malevolent power in Lex. He's just an irritant. Someone to move the plot forward for no good reason other than to fulfil the promise in the title. Again, not Eisenberg's fault but why did they write him this way, instead of the power-obsessed, morally bankrupt businessman we've seen in Lex before? We didn't need Less-Interesting-Joker-Lex. </li></ul><ul><li>The arrogance of the film reminds me a little of 'Prometheus' - another film that attempted to address big issues, but had no idea what to do with them. There's no philosophy here, no intelligence - having characters rant and rave about gods and mortals doesn't give them a coherent philosophy or moral outlook. In 'The Dark Knight' The Joker had an actual philosophy - a corrupted viewpoint that ran counter to Batman's. Here, I can't tell what anyone stands for. What does Lex even want? </li></ul>How much of this mess can be blamed on Snyder is debatable - I think the bulk of the blame should be placed on Goyer & Terrio who should never be allowed to write anything ever again, including greetings on birthday cards. However, I will say that if Snyder were a half- competent director surely he should have binned this script and brought in someone else.As for the film, I know it's made a lot of money which is actually a terrible shame. It means all of those responsible will feel it's acceptable to produce something this bad, so long as it has a big budget and impressive CGI (see also: Transformers). For me, it just isn't good enough, with this budget and these actors we deserved something better. With these iconic characters to finally show together on the big screen, we deserved something astonishing. The film-makers should be embarrassed.",3,106,195,29 April 2016
The Sixth Sense," Film of the Year (So Far)
","Cole is a very disturbed kid, prone to swearing at teachers,writing obscenities and hiding out in churches. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist, tortured by guilt after the suicide of a previous patient.  His depression is threatening his relationship with his wife, but he sees in Cole a chance for redemption. But Cole's problem may not be psychological.  The boy claims to be plagued by visions of the dead... So Bruce strips down to his vest, takes out an Uzi, and BLOWS THOSE GHOSTS AWAY!!!!!     Actually, I made that up, because this isn't your typical Bruce film, but it is a very good one. Bruce does very well in it, as the shrink tormented by ghosts of his own. His performance is reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo and the film as a whole has a similar dreamlike feel to it.  The film covers similar ground thematically too - the corruption of the past by the present, the hold the dead have on the living.  Both Bruce and the boy are in the grip of the past and this is evoked by haunting images of Philadelphia hanging malevolently over them both. The other performances are very fine too.  The young boy conveys his terror and incomprehension very well and Toni Collette ('You're TERRIBLE Muriel!') is convincing as the fraught mother, trying to save her son from something she can't even comprehend. The film has a washed-out, dead look to it, similar to The Exorcist and the film probes similar anxieties (the mother's impotence to protect her child from abuse).  But this is a much more compassionate film than The Exorcist and stays away from in-your-face horror, inducing instead a low-key feeling of tension and unease. It's beautifully shot, well acted, cleverly written and rather creepy. I think it must be a good film, because it's made me come over all pretentious.
Many of the previous reviewers have dwelt on the ending of this movie.  I think those who felt the film stands or falls on this one point really don't get what the movie is all about...",9,0,0,27 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Save Me From Fanboy Hate
","Dear lord, there's nothing more furious than a disappointed fanboy.Having read page after page after page of 1 star 'Worst. Film. Ever.' type reviews I had to redress the balance.'The Force Awakens' is a good, enjoyable, sci-fi romp. There, I've said it. Sadly, that's not what these chaps appear to have wanted. I think they were after a the sci-fi equivalent of a 5th gospel or something. Although I concede that the main criticism - that the film shamelessly steals plot-points from 'A New Hope' are well- founded. However, what a lot of these fanatics appear to have forgotten is that the 'Remake! Not sequel!' criticism was equally applied to 'Return of the Jedi' when it came out (I remember it well - and although it pre-dated the internet, print critics were particularly harsh about the 'new' Death Star and the uber-cuteness of the Ewoks).Thirty years on, 'Return of the Jedi' is a film we all now apparently agree is another good, enjoyable, sci-fi romp. So 'Star Wars' under the guidance of George Lucas, plagiarised itself. And now JJ Abrams has done the same - why the outrage?A few of the reviews claim this film is worse than episodes 1 to 3 despite the fact that the leads in this film are actually pretty good (and not burdened with risible dialogue about medichloriens).The plot is fast-moving, the return of the 'veterans' is well- handled and Kylo Ren is a much more interesting villain than Darth Maul, Count Dooku and General Grievous combined. The bad guys aren't villainous pseudo-Japanese (instead you get a Scottish hard man) there isn't a horrid child actor and some of the dialogue is actually pretty funny.Yes, I experienced deja vu during this movie. You have to bear in mind that the writers were clearly trying to make this 'familiar' to audiences, given they were introducing 3 new unfamiliar leads. But the action sequels are breathless and enjoyable and the visuals are terrific.People giving this film one star need to take a breath, step back and appreciate what the film makers have accomplished. They've brought excitement back to something that nearly sent me to sleep in the turgid 'Attack of the Clones'. Give these guys a break.p.s. Also, no Jar-Jar. That in itself must be worth a 3 point bonus.",8,1,14,13 December 2016
What We Do in the Shadows," An Exceptional Surprise
","I'm not a huge fan of mockumentaries. They've been so overdone. Ditto vampire films. I've also not really into 'Flight of the Conchords' so when this went on, I was only half paying it any attention.I'm telling you all this so you'll understand when I say I loved this. I wasn't expecting to, but I found myself recommending it to everyone who would listen. Now it's your turn.If you enjoy Eddie Izzard monologues, then imagine one come to life. In this film you'll get to see how vampires do the vacuuming, how vampires eat chips and why vampires put newspaper down when entertaining a guest.All the cast look like they are having great fun, and I loved Rhys Darby as a very responsible werewolf, making sure all the members of his pack are wearing stretchy pants on the night of the full moon.Deducting one point for lack of originality, but other than that I can't fault this. Terrific fun.",9,12,17,24 March 2016
