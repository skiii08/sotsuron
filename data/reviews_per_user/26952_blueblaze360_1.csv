Men in Black 3," If you are expecting a fun, family friendly movie, this is not it.
","I watched this movie thinking it was to be another fun Men in Black movie... Something that could be enjoyed by the whole family, young and old. I was wrong. Besides being boring (it may have picked up later in the movie, but I stopped watching half way through), it was full of racism, bad jokes and a dubious representation of the time most of the movie was set (the late 60s). Needless to say, I didn't laugh once and was probably more annoyed than amused. The Fresh Prince has gotten old and I would have hoped Will Smith matured beyond this kind of role. At 44 he's still acting like a juvenile for the cameras. Still, it was ultimately the writers and director's responsibility to make the movie palatable for its target audience (??). It's been 10+ years since the first movie was released, you'd think they would have tried to mature Agent J's character a little...or hire somebody younger to fill the role. Tommy Lee Jones was bland, but what would you expect? Etan Cohen and Barry Sonnenfeld are probably to blame most for this stinker, as they wrote and directed it. To summarize: If you are expecting a fun family friendly movie, this is not it.",1,6,13,28 September 2012
