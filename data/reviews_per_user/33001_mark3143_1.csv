Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good introduction
","Despite negative reviews by most critics, PM smoothly accomplishes what it sets out to do:  set up the romance between Anakin and Anidala, and hint at Palpatine's (the phantom menace) rise to power.  The visual effects, needless to say, are dazzling. There is a noticeable lack of warmth, humor, and romance in this movie. But there is just so much that needs to be done in two hours that I'm not really sure which aspect could be sacrificed to allow more time for those attributes.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
