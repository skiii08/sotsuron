Minority Report," EXCELLENT concept of what the future might hold
","This Tom Cruise sci-fi/ action/ mystery is chock full of what you would expect from a Spielberg film: perfect lighting; tight rhythm; and deep storytelling. We are treated to a realistic (at last) glimpse of the future. Tom Cruise portrays Captain John Anderton of the Washington D.C. Pre-Crime Division of the Police Department.His unit is nearing the end of a six-year experiment that is designed to prevent murders before they happen. Anderton's unit is succeeding at nearly 100% because of the abilities of three humans who possess the unique ability to see future murders. Their ability is the reult of being born to addicts of a new drug called 'neuroin' which was actually designed for other purposes, but ends up as a street drug similar to heroin.This is a must see so I won't divulge ANY plot details, suffice to say that Anderton becomes a projected murderer and has less than 36 hours to find out what is happening.The film portrays a future world of electric cars and a fully intergrated world wide web that is comercially used to its maximum potential. However the world is not perfect: precrime was devised to reverse a skyrocketing murder trend in the United States. Anderton himself is addicted to neuroin, and we see other examples of urban squallor and decay that demonstrate we will not have all the answers in 50 years. Also notable in the film is the performance of Colin Farrell as Anderton's adversary, who later begins to suspect that Anderton's crime was arranged by someone else. Max von Sydow also is excellent as Anderton's benevolent (and later malevolent) boss.
Three words: SEE THIS FILM",10,0,0,6 March 2003
Detroit Rock City," A time capsule...
","This movie was a very intense trip back through time for me. I was the same age as the four main characters in the movie in 1978, and I actually got chills at how well Rifkin manages to recreate middle America in 1978. The story is solid, the wardrobes/ hair styles are incredibly accurate, and even the sound track is on track. There may have been some errors as pointed out by others, but these are so few and far between, that they don't make any discernible impact on the film. I give it 8/10 because I lived through this era at that age, and I recognized every song, reference, and nuance that was represented.THANK YOU ADAM RIFKIN!!!!",Null,1,3,22 October 2002
