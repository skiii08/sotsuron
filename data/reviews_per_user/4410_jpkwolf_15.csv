The New World," You'll either love it or hate it
","I didn't know much about The New World when I went to see it in the movies. I had few hours to pass and some critics gave the movie rave reviews. I'm glad I like all kinds of movies and not just adventure and action movies because The New World is more a historical romantic drama. The movie shows the beauty of unspoiled nature of America, the Indians living there and how the settlers affect Pocahontas and her life. Pocahontas is an innocent child of the nature and beautiful in mind, soul and body. The first American John Smith falls for her for obvious reasons. The love between Pocahontas and Smith isn't shown through words but thoughts. To me that gave much depth to the affair and the characters. The movies soundtrack is also wonderful really setting the mood. Besides about the beauty of the untouched America, clash of the cultures and the romance between John Smith and Pocahontas the movie is about the insanity of man. The settlers were lead with someone having a medal in his neck and so being the leader seemed like children playing to me. Most actors do a great job including Christian Bale one of my favorite actors at the last half of the movie. I didn't know how the story of Pocahontas and John Smith went before the movie so it was exciting to see how it developed. In the end when I left the theater the movie left me moved. With so many things pulled off in such a good way how could it not. The movie is very artistic so you will either love it or hate it.",10,6,13,3 March 2006
The Maze Runner," Entertaining and intense sci-fi movie
","I'm not too interested about Hunger Games. It's like Battle Royal for teens. Don't care about the Divergent series either. So I was surprised Maze Runner was so good. Maze Runner felt often like a proper sci-fi movie. It was intense and interesting. The movie is another one of those new teenage sci-fi dystopia series but I'll give it credit for being a good one.I would give it even higher score but I believe there was one annoying plot hole or at least it would have required some explanation. Anyway, I recommend this movie and want to see the sequel. Bring on the scorch trials!",7,1,2,29 August 2015
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A ticket to a magical land
","You could compare Narnia to Lord Of The Rings in detail and richness. The movie moves in quite of a fast pace and there are no dull moments. Like with King Kong the CGI has reached a new level. The animals look and move in a life like way. The child actors do a very good job especially the little Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie. The other star of the show is Tilda Swinton as the white witch. I can't remember seeing a better bad guy/gal on the silver screen recently. Sometimes the obvious Christian undertones bothered me but you have to remember when the books were written. Otherwise the story is pure class. What made me gasp in awe were the battle scenes at the end of the movie. All the details, camera tricks and sword fight choreography made it something wonderful. I can't wait for the other Narnia movies to come out.",10,2,4,8 January 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Good sequel
","I was a fan of the first Ice Age movie so I was looking forward to the sequel. I'm glad to say the sequel doesn't disappoint. The cast of the first movie return, some new friends are found that are good additions to the group. In the sequel more room is given to the antics of Scrat who the audience loves. The movies main plot is that the Ice Age is over and Sid, Manny and Diego must leave where they live as the ice is melting and causing a huge flood. Maybe not as funny and heart warming as the first movie but it comes very close and Scrat is truly on fire in this one. As a whole I really enjoyed the movie and want to see it again. I also loved the drawings during the end credits.",8,2,4,6 April 2006
Oldboy," Clever and original piece of movie making
",A guy is kidnapped and prisoned for 15 years. He doesn't know why he was prisoned. Then he is released and is hungry for revenge. That's the basic plot of this movie. The story is great with many clever twists and turns. Sometimes the movie was a bit confusing but there is nothing too complicated. The movie was also a bit violent and included few realistic but cool fighting scenes although it's by no means an action movie. Hollywood is remaking this movie for the year 2006 and I think if someone like David Fincher directs and we add some great actors to the soup it could be even better for me at least. Not to say things were bad here. Just with a even bigger budget and things I can see this movie being even better if they don't change wrong things. They could sharpen the edges of this diamond.,8,7,88,19 January 2006
Alexander," Alexander the mediocre
","The actors mostly did well though Collin Farrel as Alexander had to cry at least three scenes too much. The structure of the movie and the whole nature of it felt a bit uneven. Still the movie was interesting and somewhat enjoyable to watch. Alexander contained only two battle scenes which were portrayed very well and in a violent manner. They were interesting and good camera angles were used. The movie contained lots of homosexual references which makes stupid narrow minded people cringe. Unfortunately they were only references. I wish Oliver Stone would have been more daring with this issue. The biggest conqueror of all time was gay or at least bisexual. Get over it. Some scenes could have been made shorter in the movie but the only completely unnecessary scene was the long heterosexual sex scene, so all the jocks could masturbate over Angelina Jolies ass and titties. How about a proper homosexual scene to make up for it? Or how about just leaving that scene to the cutting room floor?In the end Alexander is not great. Instead he is quite mediocre.",5,0,0,19 January 2006
Suicide Squad," A mediocre antihero movie with a great cast.
","The best part of the movie is the cast. Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and she steals the show. Will Smith as Deadshot gets close. Their characters get more screen time than the others. They havebetter and longer backstories, so there's more depth to the characters.Only character I didn't enjoy was Jared 'douchebag' Letos Joker who just doesn't impress. He purrs and growls in a weird way and is not particularly menacing or intimidating. He is decent but c'mon, Joker is supposed to be so much more. Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson did it so much better.The storyline feels disjointed at parts and gives the movie a rushed feel. Biggest problem of the movie however are the antagonists that are quite boring and the third act that becomes a generic battle without any suspense. Overall Suicide Squad is not terrible, just quite mediocre. The cast is great but ultimately that is not enough as this movie should be amazing. At least the story doesn't jump around all over the place or drag along too much like Batman v Superman and it's a slightly better film than that good looking mess of a movie.",6,2,4,13 August 2016
Ant-Man," Ant-Man is highly enjoyable and a lot of fun
","Top-3 tier for Marvel? I'd say so. Your enjoyment will depend on how much you enjoy epic ensemble action or feel good superhero action with lots of comedy and some feels. So are you more Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy kind of guy? If you say GOTG then I think you'll enjoy Ant- Man.The movie is very well balanced structure wise and you can feel Edgar Wrights touch in this although he left the project. Corey Stoll is great as the villain and the rest of the cast is great too. Highly recommended, then again I don't think Marvels own studios have made a bad movie (Except few mediocre ones like The Incredible Hulk and the first Captain America movie) and this is another very enjoyable film.",9,1,9,30 July 2015
Little Miss Sunshine," A real loser is someone who doesn't even try
","I love movies like Little Miss Sunshine. Drama movies where there is good humor and the characters are detailed and deep. You get to know them and start to like them.. or maybe hate them. The thing is that they feel real. In Little Miss Sunshine you could believe this family exists. In the movie this family of different personalities decide that no matter what they will take their little girl to the child miss contest called Little Miss Sunshine. All kinds of chaos ensues in a way slightly similar to National Lampoons Holiday movies just in a more realistic and serious way. The acting is wonderful. Little Olive, Frank and Dwayne are especially acted well and great characters. I actually remember their names which rarely happens when I watch a movie. The child miss contest in the end of the movie is absolutely hilarious. My only gripe with the movie is that it ends without a proper ending sequence. I wanted to know what happened to the characters after the contest.",10,2,6,8 December 2006
Batman Begins," Finally a good Batman movie
","The movie tells in a detailed way how Bruce Wayne became Batman. Concentrating on his fears, childhood, training and how he started as Batman. The actors did a good job and the story is most faithful to the comic books from all the Batman movies. The bad guys were good. Ra's Al Ghul was definitely not bad and Scarecrow was great. Sadly the fight scenes were really hard to follow with stupid close ups and fast cuts. I guess you can blame the editor for this and the studio afraid of a higher rating. I remember the old Tim Burton's Batman movies where you could actually see what was happening in the fight scenes. Otherwise a great reboot for the Batman franchise. Something the series needed more than anything.",8,0,1,4 October 2005
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 sadly suffers from many same things as Spider-Man 3
","My expectations for this movie were quite high as I really enjoyed The Amazing Spider-Man. The script and pace of the reboot were good with a great new cast. Based on the trailers I expected the sequel to be even better.The cast is as great as ever with Andrew Garfield being perfect as Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Emma Stone is still great as Gwen Stacy. She and Garfield have great chemistry going on. Dane DeHaan does good work as Harry. Jamie Foxx feels a bit miscast as Electro but also acts quite well to make up for it. Marc Webb knows how to direct the actors and their scenes feel warm, funny, sad and real.The movies problems lie with it's slightly too long and uneven script. The script could have used some trimming and polishing. The side plot about the past of Richard Parker feels fairly unnecessary and the pace of the movie is completely off. Sad things to notice as in the first movie the pacing was top notch. In the end Electro feels somehow under used and quite mediocre as the villain. I'm also a bit disappointed at how the Green Goblin looks in this incarnation. He needs to look more monstrous and goblin like. The final fight with the Goblin is decent but I expected slightly more from this important scene. All in all the battles range from decent to pretty good. The 3D is good and the effects look great.The most interesting thing about the movie is where it leaves our hero, the other characters and what doors have been opened now. Sadly that in itself tells about the flaws of this movie. It feels like the good actors are prisoners of a mediocre and uneven script. Apart from introducing Harry and few plot twists this movie feels somehow like filler material. It's an extremely flawed film but not without it's merits. Hopefully Amazing Spider-Man 3 will have a better and more balanced script.",5,1,6,3 June 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Really entertaining sequel with small flaws (Also minor spoilers in the review)
","I might have actually enjoyed this sequel more than the first Avengers film. Somehow it doesn't feel as polished though with Visions sudden appearance at the end being one of the pacing problems. Apparently almost 30 minutes ended up on the cutting room floor to avoid the movie being too long. That sadly slightly shows. Also there's a limit to Whedon style witty banter and I think the limit was reached here. It's fitting for Iron Man but now every character is doing it constantly making the movie almost feel like half comedy. Pacing of the movie also suffers when the movie is forced to set up the next films, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers 3.The action is spectacular as always, Iron Man vs Hulk being one of the highlights with the final battle. The charismatic actors work well together and there's actually some proper character development. Whedon knows how to give every character enough screen time and scenes. Age of Ultron is a great sequel that lives up to the demands of the audience and the first film, although there are almost too many characters now. The sequels will have really hard time balancing so many characters when there's even more to come.",8,2,6,12 May 2015
Mama," Great horror movie ruined by it's second half.
","*Minor spoilers ahead*The movie builds it's atmosphere quite nicely with great camera work and direction. The actors do a good job, especially the little girls act great. Sadly the script is very flawed. I think the movie would have seriously benefited from less is more approach until the very end. It's also possible the movie could have been better if the script had you guessing is Mama real or not. Unfortunately the movie falls flat with some unintentionally funny moments, bad CGI and a cliché ending. It's sad because this film had so much potential and about until the middle of the film the premise worked well and it had some very spooky scenes.",5,1,2,22 March 2013
Wedding Crashers," A comedy for Americans
","I know what makes Americans laugh. Someone getting tackled really hard, a granny that curses and a weird gay guy. For me those things those things were funny in the eighties or maybe when I was a kid. Not anymore. I have to admit there are some slightly funny moments but not anything that made me laugh out loud. There are movies that did this better like Meet The Parents and Oldschool. They are maybe not the funniest movies ever but funnier than Wedding Crashers. I didn't find Wedding Crashers funny but I was still interested to see how it ended. After all the characters were quite likable. So it wasn't funny but the story wasn't that bad. Still I wish my comedies to be funny and lately American comedies are that less and less.",4,0,0,19 January 2006
V for Vendetta," Remember, remember, the fifth of November
","Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot. Dare I say V is better than The Matrix. At least in attitude, message and story wise it is. V's story is based in a dystopia where the Great Britain is leading super power in the world. They have a conservative government that bases it's power around religion, security where everyone is watched upon 24/7, minorities are removed from the streets and peoples rights are strictly restricted. This is what the conservative sides of the government and people are all about if things go in the worst way possible. What conservatives don't want to see is that this is where their ideas could lead to and this is something the American government is slowly moving towards. The direction is great and the actors do a good job. The movie isn't very action oriented which is just fine because it doesn't need lots of fighting to work. The final dagger fight scene is well worth seeing for action fans though. Action wise V For Vendetta doesn't offer as much as The Matrix but otherwise I prefer V For Vendetta. V For Vendetta is the first must see movie of 2006.",10,1,3,30 March 2006
