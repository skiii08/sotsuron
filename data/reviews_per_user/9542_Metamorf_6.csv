Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Artistically inferior to it's predecessors, but somehow is still awesome to watch.
","Although it's very much agreed that this 'Episode 1' is a far cry from the original Star Wars trilogy, there are a number of set pieces that are truly astounding (visually at least at any rate).  In particular the huge establishing shots of the Podrace Arena, the marching Gungan Army, the Galactic Senate and the Final Victory Parade.  It's worth at least one repeat viewing for these alone.",9,7,9,4 August 1999
Fight Club," Social Satire at it's head-bludgeoning best.
","After a rocky start with his feature debut in 'Alien 3', David Fincher is proving to be a real talent in movieland.  With 'Seven', he showed his seemingly sudden mastery of the crime thriller.  he may have taken a small step backward with 'The Game', but with this one, he has taken a huge leap forward.Satire usually takes one of two forms, humorous (parody) or serious.  This is BOTH.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give very fine performances as men disenchanted with the world which has been fashioned for themselves, prompting them to go about turning it on it's ear.Fincher also gives us some wildly kinetic camera moves and EXTREMELY CLOSE close-ups that are a feast for the eyes.There's a great plot twist at the start of the third act that came as a complete surprise to me as did the one in 'The Sixth Sense'.  Now I'm gonna have to see the film again to look for all the clues that led up to it.Two fists up -- 10/10",10,0,1,17 November 1999
12 Monkeys," Witty, Intelligent treatise on Time Travel
","This film is an embodiment of Terry Gilliam's art.  As well as his unique vision of the past, present and future, he manages to coax excellent performances out of Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt (who otherwise tend to be wooden or even leaden).Often the paradoxes of time travel are glossed over in such-themed films, but not here.  There are numerous little details that only come to light long after the credits roll.  And that only make you want to see it again and again and...Monkeys Shine -- 10/10",10,0,0,11 November 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Masterpiece of a Master-craftsman
","It doesn't matter how many superlatives anyone uses, it will still be understating this body-and-mind-hammering film.  I refuse to watch it on video as this could only be detrimental the the whole 2001 experience.  And every viewing is an experience.I last saw this film when a fresh 70mm print was going around Australia, and the cinema had the sound cranked up LOUD.  I was mesmerised with every single frame.To paraphrase co-writer Arthur C. Clarke, Kubrick is one of the nine billion names of God.Thus spake Zarathustra -- 14/10 (my ratings system was blown out of the water)",10,1,3,12 November 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A unique erotic thriller makes a fine swan-song for Kubrick
","I don't think anybody but Kubrick could have pulled this off -- a gripping thriller that crawls along at a snail's pace.Even though the film's pace is very slow, it is *hypnotic*.  With each line of dialogue, Kubrick gradually turns the screws tighter and tighter until the tension becomes almost unbearable.  Only then, does he let the tension go, but not all of it.  The finale still leaves an air of uncertainty over Alice (Kidman) and Bill's (Cruise) relationship.Be patient, Keep your eyes wide open -- 10/10",10,0,0,14 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," A Jaw-dropping denouement.
","As I was watching the opening credits and the words 'Directed by M. Night Shyalaman' flashed on screen, I wondered 'whozzatguy?'. Well, I guess everyone knows now.It's nice to see that Mr Willis is maturing as an actor, and is starting to show a knack for sympathetic characterisations. But, Man, Haley Joel Osment--what a find. I don't think I have ever seen a more mature, forceful performance from a child actor.To cap it all off, the final plot-twist is an even bigger jaw-landing-in-your-lap surprise than the one in 'The Crying Game'. DON'T DARE LET ANYONE GIVE IT AWAY BEFORE YOU SEE IT.Sense-ational -- 9/10",9,0,0,12 November 1999
