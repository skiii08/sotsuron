Hereditary," Interesting movie, might watch again
","Although the first hour is really slow, the movie got me interested till the end. No jumpscares or bloody-bath scenes, it relies on the ambient it creates and the interesting plot to get you through the length of the film.Might watch again because I had a feeling I had missed some things after I saw it.",7,1,2,1 November 2018
Deadpool 2," Deadlong
","The ending scene with Wade dying summarizes the whole movie pretty well. It lingers on and on and on with no added value whatsoever.Jokes were not funny, predictable movie altogether. Just milking on the success of the first one without anything new worth for it.",6,3,5,17 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor will return in Avengers: Infinity War
","A 2-hourish long, slow-paced, not enough action-packed prologue to Avengers: Infinity War. Mildly interesting...",4,3,6,27 May 2018
Ready Player One," Overrated nostalgia
","Don't take me wrong, I enjoyed the movie: great soundtrack, stuffed with pop culture references... but that was mostly all about it... Plot is sligtly bloated and there's no much more 'juice' in it.Worth to watch just for the nostalgia and even has replay value to spot all references... I will surely listen to the OST more than once though.",7,0,1,3 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Popcorn fest!
","Comedy and action at equal parts. Grab the biggest bucket of popcorn and your favourite soda and enjoy!Yeah, the plot is meh but as long as you have popcorn in the bucket, why bother...Best thing after Guardians of the Galaxy 2.",8,1,2,1 June 2018
The Disaster Artist," The Room costed over 6M $?
","Watched this after 'The Room' and the most shocking fact was realising the original movie costed over 6M dollars... I thought that was a low budget movie at most a few thousand dollars budget.About this movie, nothing substantial except the interpretation of James Franco. For the rest pretty dull and boring movie to just get into the making of The Room.",4,0,3,27 October 2018
Sausage Party," Food with a pretty bad taste
",Full of racial stereotypes and sexual references. This is the dumbest movie I remember.,2,0,2,9 November 2018
Mother!," Fantastic experience!
",Weird experience in the best possible way. Will keep you on the edge of your seat all along.,8,1,1,10 November 2018
