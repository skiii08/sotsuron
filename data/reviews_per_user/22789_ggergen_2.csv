Minority Report," Never before has so much been spent to produce so little.
","If money, glitz, and techno magic could make a movie this would have been one for the ages.  But, from the Wizard of OZ to the Manchurian Candidate to The Matrix it is the human side of piercing into the human psychic that makes the movies not the gadgets.There is nothing believable about this movie whether it is the characters, or the action sequences.  Save your money.",1,4,8,14 July 2002
28 Days Later...," Why don't the characters figure out how to survive?
","Possible Spoiler!!!This movie made no sense.If the uninfected, know that the infected have no organization, never use weapons, and are basically enraged biting machines why don't they use that to their advantage?Why don't the uninfected get guns.  Why don't they just drive out into the country in a large industrial machine?  Why don't they go into one of London's many police station and grab their loud speaker equipment and call out for and organize other uninfected people.Finally, the uninfected, made no study of the infected.  Did they bite only once to spread the infection?,  Did they have any language skills?The only thing that kept me at all interested in the movie, was counting opportunity after opportunity missed by the uninfected to take simple measures to survive.I compare this movie to invasion of the body snatchers from the late 1950's where the uninfected learn the methodology of the disease, much more interesting.",2,0,2,13 July 2003
