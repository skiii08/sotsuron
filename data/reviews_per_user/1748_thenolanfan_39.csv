The Devil's Advocate," Review - The Devil's Advocate
","This movie, for me, is too slow to progress, and when it achieves finally is conclusion, it become to explanatory, it explains every single bit of what happened throughout the movie, this moment becomes very long and boring.There is no emotions in it, the couple between Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves doesn't seems real.Furthermore, the visual effect dated very badly, it is almost laughable. Fortunately, there is not as effects as they planned the first time, otherwise It would have been terrible.Finally, surprisingly, I like the last line of the movie, I though that this one was surprising and well-written otherwise the rest of the screenplay is basic.",6,0,5,15 February 2020
Ford v Ferrari," Review - Ford v Ferrari
","Since, the trailer, I didn't have high expectation on this movie, it felt like another bland movie about patriotism and success, and this is exactly what it was, I wasn't invested the story like in Rush because there wasn't much rivalry between the racers. However, it does well in term of sound and more practical effects, I have heard that this movie is really accurate to cars of that time, and I believe that if you are a car fan, you will like this movie.But as I said this movie is not very intelligent and well-written, it is just entertaining when you watch it whit you brain-off.",6,1,3,15 February 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Review - Kill Bill: Vol 2
","Unlike his predecessor, this movie is more axed toward the drama than the action. The identity of Bill has revealed very quickly in the movie and on a certain aspect, the movie lost a part of his glamorous spirit.While I appreciate this touch of drama, I have some criticizes to do regarding the flashbacks, this flashback scenes like in many movies of Quentin Tarantino are what I call 'Facilitated screenwriting' in other words they explain quickly a concept with the only purpose of making the rest seemingly coherent to the view, except that these sequences are mainly based on an over explanatory storytelling that Tarantino attempted to attenuate by using humor.Some scenes are however are simply masterpieces, I can take to illustrate my point, the final confrontation between The Bride and Bill. In this scene, Bill asks Beatrix if she felt satisfaction after killing her victims, to that she answers 'yes', but in her eyes, you can see remorse. Maybe I'm over-interpreting it, but as I see it, it was a self-criticism at the violence in Tarantino's movies. He wants to highlight that all those outrageously violent scenes are for him a 'guilty pleasure'. The movie has a lot of self-references or homage which adds to the films if you have seen other Tarantino movies.Other than that this is basically a movie cut in two parts, so It wouldn't be reasonable to give a different rating to one or another. This mainly why I gave it an 8.To conclude, I recommend the Kill Bill Saga, and it might be one of
Tarantino's most complex and entertaining artwork.",8,0,0,10 April 2020
Antz," Review - Antz
","This is supreme level boring, the animation is just so horrible, you don't feel their emotions, even in HD, the film looks like a torrent.Plus, who wants to see giant talking ants on his TV?!!The dialogues are so horrible, I have a net impression the screenwriter chose his words by Scrabble.Don't watch this, they didn't even take the time to spell the title correctly.",5,0,1,4 May 2020
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I don't need teenagers movie.
","Everybody have been a teenager, but no one seems to remember that lockers weren't empty. I mean that in movies school always look glamour, but hat is not the case, there is a lot subtle of problem in real school, school is not always naive, peace, love. So far, I haven't seen a movie that makes a loyal depiction of the reality, it is laughable how directors, author, actor made the representation of teenager, they really need to work on that. The reality is not so simple as it seems, and you can't depict it correctly in comedy.",6,0,3,9 February 2020
The Secret in Their Eyes," Review - El secreto de sus ojos
","This foreign crime movie about a detective who is going back in his memory his just surprising, by the title or the actor, you don't expect nothing from it.At first, I thought that this was going to be some very basic thriller to watch in afternoon, but his movie while its improbably show some complex of life that are often to complex to be explain in a movie, this movie succeed well to that, you can understand the main character and all his issue with is friend, but more particularly the parallel issue with his boss which complement the story pretty well.The ending, is just amazing, this is totally what you would expect from a crime movie, usually you expect justice to be done in the proper, a way that follows the non-written ethic code of cinema, in this one you just have this one line said by the husband, and the main character understood that justice has been done, that like Irene said earlier on the movie, the justice wasn't perfect, but at least it is a justice, when he says that you know that Benjamin won't oppose to it, he know what the character has gone through and accept it.",7,0,1,14 February 2020
The Irishman," One of the best movie of the year
","This year wasn't one of the best for the cinema, but this one where Scorsese make a come back is the most realistic movie of Scorsese. Goodfellas and Casino were fabulous but more glamour, I think that the 3.5 hour runtime is totally justified because the movie follow several years of Mafia. Including, the rise and the fall of Jimmy Hoffa. Absolutely worth to watch.",8,8,13,28 November 2019
The Great Dictator," Review - The Great Dictator
","For me, The Great Dictator wasn't that bad, but it was inappropriate in the circumstances.First, We say this type of humor in all Chaplin movies, and the satire wasn't the adapted type of movie on the context. This movie fails where Life is Beautiful succeeded to depict the facts in a naive way without ignoring any of them.Second, the ending of this movie is far to clich√©. In fact, especially in this one, Chaplin didn't hide the moral of his movie, it is clearly represented in the movie. After his final speech, he received a standing ovation from the crowd. As well as ignoring all the pain and all the horrors lived in concentration camps, this movie is not only a satire of the leaders of the Axes, but of the German nation. Which I think is unacceptable.To conclude, this movie was done before the end of the war, it was to early to comprehend to hard reality, and it should have been done after to respect the victims and the verity.",6,0,3,19 February 2020
Juno," Ba screenplay, for a Best Screenplay
","Honestly, there is nothing impressive int this movie, the scenario is very similar to what you can find in teenager movie (very incoherent and throw up). The performances are very deceiving even the one of J. K. Simmons who late won a deserved Oscar for his role in Whiplash, but this movie is very overrated. To be more specific, I can say that some dialogues were very cliche, especially between Juno and Paulie Bleeker. For someone, who works with teenager every day, I also believe that this is a fairly bad depiction of what is going on in there head. Furthermore, to be honest, Ellen Page was too old for the role, and It made the movie far more incoherent at my eyes.",5,0,2,9 February 2020
L.A. Confidential," One of the last neo-noir
","This movie is an homage to every Neo-Noir and Film-Noir that preceded it like Chinatown and Sunset Boulevard, it is really a special story like we aren't used to. The scenario is amazing it gave a great heritage to our cinema. The performances made the career of these actors especially Russel Crowe and Kevin Spacey who both won the Oscar of Best Leading actors in the years that followed. Also totally deserved Oscar for Kim Basinger, and one of the best criticism to Hollywood.",9,2,2,9 February 2020
American Sniper," Review - American Sniper
","Overall, a great movies, it takes a lot of time to explain not only the war but the relationship between the members of the same family and the friendship that are related during wars.In this movie, Eastwood wanted us to feel like every soldier as and identity, this why he didn't only filmed only war sequences, there is a lot of people who died or are injured in this movie, it shows that those who dead should be remembered, they weren't only soldiers, sometimes they were husband or fathers.For the family, it is always a tragic moment to lose someone no matter the danger that they have gone through during war.Often now, Eastwood makes movie about real heroes who weren't recognized for their services soon enough. I think that it is a noble idea overall.The only place where this movie is losing points, is that I feel that a certain part of the movie was more concentrated on killing a particular sniper of the enemy, The movie goes a little bit far by making a useless emphases on that aspect of the story.I recommend this movie, it shows us that Clint Eastwood still make good movies, this one was even nominated for an Oscar.",7,29,42,22 February 2020
The Aviator," Another great Scorsese/Dicaprio movie
","This movie like many other great one of this century is a look at Hollywood, itself, but if you haven't seen it , I can say that it isn't as dark as Sunset Boulevard, no as Bright as the first 2 hours of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but not as critical as Birdman, it is a wonderful mixed between drama, while it is more leaned to the drama.This movie is not as mastered as The Irishman, but at the time Scorsese used all his knowledge in film-making which also give the impression that this movie is the transit between glamour film like The Irishman and Casino, and more mature show like Shutter Island, The Departed, The Irishman.Finally, you really need to see all the collaborations between Scorsese and DiCaprio which also includes The Departed, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wallstreet, I was never disappointed by these collaborations.",8,0,1,10 February 2020
Judgment at Nuremberg," One of the most complete scenario ever made.
","The scenarist of this movie was very skillful to handle the story related in the book, it is so good that even at the end you can't decide who is right or who is wrong, because all the arguments in both side are exceptional, they didn't try to demonize the character of Maximilian Schell, but the movie still talks about how the german society was thinking during the war, for me this movie is not absolutely centered on the american perspective which was great. I don't think that I have to say that the intro with 'Wenn Wir Marschieren' is just stunning.",8,0,0,1 February 2020
In the Name of the Father," Review - In the Name of the Father
","There is not too much to say on this movie, the acting performances were good, overall the movie is really great, but when I put a 7, I usually found a flaws. In this case, the flaws is not that you know how it ends, yes it is base on an historical fact so you can check on internet to know the entire story, but in my case, I was able to predict it only because this is how 'redemption movies' end. I repeat this is a good movie, but also a very predictable one.",7,0,2,22 February 2020
Dunkirk," Not a war movie a survival movie
","I liked a lot this movie because you can see a fell a human without liberty but this man can see his liberty near him. Christopher Nolan made with this movie
a great accomplishment. he did a movie with almost not script but if the characters almost don't speak. They speak with their physical expression. i thiNk that is very ambitious to do a movie of a Britain story that American never heard about and make it a BlockBuster. Rare are the movie that show a story of a defeat but defeat are as important as glory.
ONE OF THE BEST FILM OF HIS YEAR.",9,1,6,19 November 2018
The Intouchables," Review - Intouchables
","This movie is really good and fun, it is in some way about the emancipation of an handicapped man who hires a man to help him, they both become friends which is interesting because they came form very different social spheres. this movie is a roller-coaster, the actor perfectly played their roles and they have a lot of chemistry.However, sometimes, it becomes repetitive, some jokes become boring since they are overdo, this is one flaws of the movie.In conclusion, you need to watch this movie since it is probably the best french movie , and maybe one of the best film of the decade all country included.",8,0,1,22 February 2020
Spirited Away," Review - Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi
","I have watched it two times.The first on, I rented at the library, because I received good review about it. I had high expectations since I also watched Princess Mononoke a week before, and I was totally charmed by the original and audacious writing of Miyazaki.This movies goes deeper than you can think of, it is a Japanese fairy tale indeed, but the characters have complex feelings, the better ssociation that I can make is for Yubaba. At first, you think that she is the archetypal vilain, but as the story goes on she is more like an Anti-Villain, and you learn that she have motivations for her actions, she want to protect her world, and the spirits, she is opposed to Chihiro only because, she have no choice, this is why you make some comparisons between her and Dr. Zaius from The Planet of the Apes.Furthermore, this film adresses mature themes like the life, I can only cit the scene where Chihiro travel with the spirits in a train while we see the
landscapes to succeed to each another, and we see some spirits leave the train while no one his coming in, has a kid you can't understand these references, but they are still there to make to more mature public think and enjoy the movie.The second time it was with my students, the movie kept all his magic after that second views, and you can finally appreciate the message hidden in it that could have been hard to catch at the first time, you will enjoy even more the details that Miyazaki carried to the animation, the lights, the facials expressions. Somehow, you find somethings in Miyazaki's works that is inexplicable, but you can feel it.Finally, it is obvious that this movie helped to increase the popularity of Japanese cinema and anime when it won his first Oscar, and it was really important because as we know anime are now very influential in arts.",8,0,0,14 February 2020
The Fault in Our Stars," Review - The Fault in Our Stars
","This is a cool and charming movie about love, I think that it is one of the most well-written one of the 2010s. The acting performances are touching, you expect the end, but you don't know how fast it will come this is interesting in the movie.On the other hand, the story wasn't really realistic, I can't tell to much about it, but the end doesn't make a lot of sense.",7,1,1,22 February 2020
The Favourite," Weird
","I feel like this movie is too much of a parody, and that it goes to far from what could have been possible, I can take the example of the duck races, the lobster races etc. A lot of those scene were useless in my opinion. But, for me, the major lack is the acting performance which were like roller coaster, sometimes they were amazing, but often you could feel that nobody re-read the screenplay, before filming. Finally, the ending was just bad, what is the point us a bunch of rabbit?",5,0,3,19 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," After a rewatch it gets better
","I first rated it 6/10, but my viewing conditions weren't optimal so I bought the Blu-Ray. The best aspect about this movie is the depiction of an era, to achieve that the production design was well-thought. Plus, the scenario is original, and each dialogues are well-written and entertaining. However, I wasn't able to give it a 8/10 because, in my opinion, Tarantino failed to capture the moments when you wanted to be entertained and those where you wanted to be serious which results in some scenes that aren't respectful for the real life people involved in the story.",7,2,2,7 February 2020
The Theory of Everything," Really touching
","The scenario is perfectly well-written in this movie, the performances by Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne are wonderful so this movie makes a really good Biopic about Stephen Hawking, it tells a pertinent and needed story, it takes even more sense now after his death. I'm a little bit deceive however, that this movie is not very original, it is made with a formula that will already known, however this formula is well applied. To conclude, I think that this movie is worth a watch, but it won't become a classic.",8,0,0,9 February 2020
Transformers," Visual effects at the detriment of the story
","Transformers is a great show for 30 min, you have a lots of explosion and satisfying visual effects such as the metamorphose of Autobots in car, but the major problem is that the the scenario's blank spaces are filled with those explosions. At the end, the scenario is so poor in substance that you understand the story join the movie in the last 30 minutes. Everything becomes repetitive. At least Michael Bay is loyal to his directing style (which isn't a compliment).",6,0,3,8 February 2020
1917," Review - 1917
","First, I wanted to go to Call of the Wild with Harrison Ford, but I saw on the websit of the theater that 1917 was still projected, I had heard a ton of compliements about this film ,but I was reticent, because I thought hat the visual achievement was a pretext to win all those Oscars.I was totally off, the long-take is not made to show off the talent of Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes. it is an excellent way to accentuate the thriller aspect of the movie and the suspense of the war. Never in the movie you are bored, you are always at the edge of your seat. The all movie is subliminal, and I can compare it to Dunkirk in the way that character doesn't have a clearly identified personality, this serves the purpose of the director, Mendes wanted us to think that this film was just relating a random day in a low-graded soldier is life. The movie remains surprising. The sound is well-done, you feel that you are a companion of the corporal Schofield, like him you have no clue about was is going to happen, and when he is shot by an enemy solider like him you are tying to find out were the shot came from.I highly recommend this movie, it deserved all his nomination, but more particularly his wins in the technical categories.",8,0,0,23 February 2020
National Treasure," Bad acting performances

Reservoir Dogs," Review - Reservoir Dogs
","This first movie of Quentin Tarantino, is already from the opening scene everything you would expect from him, you have powerful and funny dialog, and obviously, a cameo by Tarantino himself.The movie is divided into sections some of them relate the story of the main characters while the main story arc is relating the end.You have all these stories that end up together.However, the flaw in this movie is the story, at my eyes, it seems that attention of details was put to have a very good and long ending, but the since the movie is only 99 minutes long, the sub-arc for each character is 'facilitated screenwriting' which means that there is no strong link created between each character. In other words, these scenes would have been good if they did bring a new element to the story. However, in this case, they relate a part of the story that was already known by the viewer or that had no influence later on, Which means that at my eyes, these are anecdotal.To conclude, I believe that another useless part of the movie is to the minor characters. Characters like Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue don't have personality, I see them as extras. A good decision by QT was to kill them because he didn't want his story to be separated into too many parts which would have made it lost its coherence. But decided to include them in the movie. The question that I ask myself is 'Why did he decided to include them in the movie if they have no purpose and they gonna die in the first few minutes'.Anyway, that is all that I got the criticize this movie, I wouldn't say that it was bad, but it was average.",6,0,2,6 April 2020
American Made," Review - American Made
","It is an enjoyable movie, with a really dynamic directing, but unfortunately, it doesn't innovate.The movie would have been way better if it was able to separate from the influence of its predecessors like Lord of War and The Big Short.The cast, in general, is playing decently, but there is zero nuance or facial expression most of the time, and the intervention 'Barry Seals' when he is breaking the fourth wall are pretty useless to the plot itself, he is commenting on something that we already saw or understood.It is not particularly a movie that I would recommend except if you want to look at all the filmography of Tom Cruise.",6,0,1,20 June 2020
Zero Dark Thirty," Surprisingly suspenseful
","If we talk strictly about it's artistic aspect this movie is wonderful, throughout the film, you don't know what is gonna happen and which character is gonna die since the movie has been so unpredictable since the opening credits, you are tethered to you seat during the last 30 min. For me, this movie is as good as you would want every movie to be, it has no flaws. But it is not a masterpiece, the concept is basic and doesn't surprise",8,1,2,8 February 2020
Joker," Excellent movie
","Tonight, I went to see the movie Joker about the origins of Batman nemesis, as you may have noticed by reading my other entries in this diary, I had extremely high expectations for this film. With so many expectations, I thought it would be difficult for this work to touch me or surprise me. Yet coming out of the cinema I was completely dazzled, by what seems to me to be the best film of the decade. This film deals well with the psychology of the character, he approaches the character as never before, the end and the revelations that are made to me took my breath away. Finally, I hope that Joaquin Phoenix, the actor who plays the Joker probably achieved the performance of his life even outperforming his own interpretation of Commodus in the Gladiator film. In Todd Phillips' film Joker, he presented a performance that pays tribute to the great names in film. I am confident that his role will be honored at the Oscars and other major awards ceremonies.",9,5,8,8 October 2019
Ray," Review - Ray (2004)
","The movie is too strict on the codes of the genre. Once again, it follows the same Storytelling arc with the same themes about tragic childhood, drug/alcohol issues, and marital issues. This movie is not innovative, and you are dulled pretty fast.Plus, the supporting actors don't feel authentic in their roles, it looks like they all play a different emotion of the same character to fill the blank spaces. Only Jamie Foxx is interpretation is good, but I wouldn't say that it was worthy of an Academy Award.Also, the music looks thrown way to do ellipsis, it ruined the narration not to mention that the CGI transitions are dated and look cringe today.Finally, I don't recommend that you watch this movie, there is so music movies like this. When you have watched one, you have watched all of them.",5,0,2,3 May 2020
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The beggining of the story is coping the legend of Cyrus Le Grand wrote by herodote
","The Grimm brother copied a part of the Cyrus the grand his legend. Therefore, the story is similar too a part of the book Artamene or the Great
Cyrus by George and Madeleine De Scudery. To illustrate, the evil queen as the same psychologic caract√©ristiques than Astiage in the legend of Herodote. Additionally, the part where the hunter is faking the dead of Snow White is really copying the Born legend of Cyrus too proof it you can just check on Wikipedia or Read the Book ( Artamene or the Great Cyrus)",3,1,13,14 January 2019
Arrival," Not over used VFX
","This movie is really well-done, the depiction of Aliens is very original, during the 2010s we didn't get a lot of Sci-Fi movie that didn't overuse the Visual effects, but this movie is clearly more focusing on the Screenplay, on the realistic aspect of the movie. Also, for a rare time, we have a story that is concentrated on the emotions of the Aliens like E.T they aren't depicted as Evil beings who want to dominate the entire world. This kind of movie when done decently and rarely is very percussive.",8,0,0,9 February 2020

Parasite," Fascinating
","I really enjoyed this film, because Bong Joon-Ho perfectly masters its original and impactful story of the underprivileged family who uses all the means at their disposal to rise in society although they are aware that there have no place. The best aspect of this film is that it takes no sides in the script. In addition, this film is wonderfully topical although it only briefly touches on subjects such as social networks, it does this very effectively by mixing Thriller and Comedy.",8,10,14,3 February 2020

Jojo Rabbit," Review - Jojo Rabbit
","I actually liked how they portrayed the events from the perspective of a child. Jojo has a great narrative arc, he evolves a lot throughout the movie, especially after the death of his mother, but also through his complex relationship with Elsa. Sometimes he has a great difficulty to guess if he is feeling loved or friendship towards her, it really portrays the bunch of emotions that a young adolescent like him could go through.Of course, Taika Waititi is an excellent director that has the talent to capture comic scenes in his movie and to write interesting and likable characters.Finally, this movie is probably not as historically accurate as you would like and can be very divisive due to his type of humor, but give it a try.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
