Requiem for a Dream," This movie is sad, and I really felt it..
","I saw this with a friend in an almost desolated theater which brought up the overall mood of the picture. This movie is about drugs, and it presents drugs as drugs, not if it's good or bad, that is up to the viewer to decide. Though, the movie does not tell why these people take drugs, if it is to flee from the repetitiveness of everyday life or just ordinary teen-depression could be nice to know.The mother is clearly my favorite character, representing the emptiness that could be found in a lonely life. Her reason to keep on breathing is to be on a nationwide TV-show and to be respected and loved by the audience, a goal which she more or less achieves by taking drugs..Although this is a great picture, I felt at moments that time was stretched in order to fill a whole film, filling it with pointless scenes of trance states instead of more in-depth explaining why life sucks without drugs to the point where I have to become an addict.7.5/10",Null,0,1,28 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," A great piece for the audience it was meant for..
","It has the romance, the good-looking people, the special-effects and the musical score. It has the scenes that literally screamed 'CRY DAMNIT THIS IS SAD' and it works for the majority of people as my folks where drowning in tears.. It's not a bad movie compared to the mainstream selection of movies, but I personally felt irritated with all the glorification of the United States of America and Ben Affleck as the unselfish hero. And the last 30 minutes where PAIN..",Null,1,2,28 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A little romantic, but all in all good
","Even though I had no idea who John Nash was, I enjoyed this piece almost through the entire film. It could have been more deep and less explaining that 'John is schizophrenic', because it very obviously reveals that he indeed is experiencing people living only in his mind. The end also leaves one with a bitter taste, the glorification and the all the tears with the point that 'this f*cking loser managed to get a nobelprize so we adore him'. But all in all it is good entertainment, Russel plays his part good so does his wife which I in this moment of time have forgotten the real name of.",8,0,1,30 January 2002
