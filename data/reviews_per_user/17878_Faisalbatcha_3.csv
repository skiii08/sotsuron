10 Cloverfield Lane," Annoying thriller
","Yep. That is how I would describe this movie. Seriously, how confusing can someone make the viewers, but still in the end you give a feeling that you spending time on this movie was not complete waste.Every scene, every dialogue and every moment that happens in the movie kept me thinking, what the hell is happening. Till the very end that leaves you thinking - What?! Honestly, giving a review without the spoilers or this movie is very hard. So I would leave you'll to see this movie, experience the annoyance yet splendid movie that this is.",7,2,4,22 June 2016
Last Flag Flying," How did I miss this?
","I watched this couple of days ago. And I'm typing this April of 2019. And my only question has been, how did I miss this?The story is simple, yet beautiful. Funny yet emotional. And most of all, at the end, it takes you to a place where you start to appreciate your close friends or try to be an amazing friend for your close buddies.And most of all, the acting was quite genuine. It looked as if they all just got together and they were just being themselves.It was a pleasure seeing them all work together.",8,1,3,15 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Dream come true.
","Oh what a movie! It was a dream come true for me to see both of my favourite actors together.
And the speed of the movie was absolute perfection. Attention to details were next level of perfection.
The charecter's and their perfect way the role was played by each of the actors were demanded to absolute perfection by Tarantino.It was the best 3 hours of my life. And I didn't even know it was almost 3 hours. I didn't even watch the trailers or teasers or anything related to this movie.Not knowing what it even is about, is the perfect way to watch any movie and this was blowing my brain into pieces since the start.Ohh the acting, the dialogues, the movements everything was crazy crazy good.Apologies for freaking out on the reviews, but very rarely some movies takes me to this kind of happiness.",10,22,32,23 August 2019
