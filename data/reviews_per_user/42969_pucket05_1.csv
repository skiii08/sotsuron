Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Most Adventurous Man In the World
","If the Dos Equis guy is the 'the most interesting man in the world', then Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is the most adventurous man in the world. Armed with a fedora, a whip, and his trusty pistol, Indiana Jones is brains and brawl all wrapped in one. Who else would bring a whip to a sword fight and actually win? There's only one, and he is the most adventurous man in the world, Indiana Jones.Sent on a mission by the United States government, Indiana Jones tries to stop an old foe Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) from helping the Nazis find the scared Ark of the Covenant. Who knew archeology was so adventurous?However, Raiders of the Lost Ark was more than just an action film pitting good versus evil on the big screen. It's also a love story wrapped inside chase scenes and encounter with poisonous snakes; and if there is one thing that Indiana Jones hates its snakes. If Indiana Jones is going to successfully find the Ark of the Covenant he will need the help of an old flame, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Marion is tough, and can hold her own and can certainly hold her liquor, and she's the keeper of a secret tool Indiana Jones needs to find the prize Ark. But if he wants it, then she's going with him. Her sense of adventure and fighting skills are on par with Indy's, but her ability to escape trouble could put her and Indiana Jones' life on the line. Save the girl, or finish the mission, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a love story wrapped inside an action adventure movie.The first of four in this series, Raiders of the Lost Ark is by far the leader of the pack. This film may not have all the visual effects Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull possessed (2008), but the story line, the fighting, and even the old school visual effects helped to make this movie an all-time classic that will live on for generations to come.There is only one man to call when the world needs to be saved from Nazis in search of a lost ark of the covenant. He's the only man who can go toe to toe with poisonous snakes, or fight his way out of trouble, and still keep his patent fedora hat firmly planted on his head. He is the most adventurous man in the world, and his name is Indiana Jones.",8,0,1,23 March 2014
