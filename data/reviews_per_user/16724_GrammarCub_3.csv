Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thrilling installment of classic serial
","George Lucas has done it again. The man behind arguably the most popular movie series of all time, the 'Star Wars' trilogy, has expanded the now-classic saga and given us its prehistory. Long-time fans of the series will delight in seeing Luke and Leia's parents, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and even audience favorites Yoda, R2-D2, and Jabba the Hutt.The plot, true-to-form of the best episodic series, is full of political intrigue, colorful characters, far-off locales, and exciting battle sequences. The evil villains, the beautiful princess, the wise heroes - all are familiar territory to us and they all fit nicely with the Star Wars universe. George Lucas both wrote and directed 'Phantom Menace,' a task he has not undertaken since the original 'Star Wars' movie. The Lucas touch shows - and the audience responds.'The Phantom Menace,' while completely entertaining and well worth the admission price, is not without its flaws. Jar-Jar Binks, one of the completely computer-generated characters in the film, is just plain irritating and leaves me hoping that his Gungan race will not be making any appearances in the second and third films. There's also a two-headed alien in the pod-racing sequence who just doesn't belong in this universe - maybe this type of character would be appropriate for 'Spaceballs' or one of the anachronistic jokes in a Disney movie like 'Aladdin' or 'Hercules,' but the sportscaster simply detracts from the mythological impact of the film.The performances are quite good. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are superb as the Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi; Natalie Portman is riveting as the girl-geisha Queen Amidala; even young Jake Lloyd pulls off a touching, empathetic Anakin Skywalker. Ian McDiarmid reprises his role as Senator Palpatine, later known as the Emperor. The supporting cast is also excellent - Samuel L. Jackson, Terence Stamp, and Pernilla August play their small roles with class and dignity - for a style so melodramatic, it's reassuring when the performances manage to be both subtle and powerful. The only performances that feel wrong are the computer generated characters: Jar-Jar Binks, Watto the slave owner, Sebulba the podracer, even the Battle Droids are quite obviously false. Instead of focusing on the character, as we were able to do with Yoda or the Ewoks, we focus on the technological marvels that have made Jar-Jar possible.Fans of the original trilogy and newcomers to the series are sure to enjoy this 'Menace' - while clumsy at times and a bit confusing plotwise, it has a charm to it that fits in precisely with the type of Saturday-afternoon serial Lucas strove to emulate. Just like the 'Indiana Jones' movies made with Hollywood royalty Steven Spielberg, the 'Star Wars' movies are pure escapist fantasies, sure to take you back long, long, ago to a galaxy far, far away.",4,0,1,22 May 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Funny, clever update of Shakespeare classic
","'10 Things I Hate About You' is a funny, clever update of the Shakespeare classic, 'The Taming of the Shrew.' The premise for the story is much the same -- in the original, Bianca Minola could not marry until her older sister Katharine was wed -- in the new movie, Bianca Stratford cannot date until her older sister Kat does. Petruchio, now renamed 'Patrick Verona,' is paid by one of Bianca's suitors and thus neatly sidesteps the whole dowry issue. The jokes are funny, and the situation is just ludicrous enough to be entertaining without insulting the audience's intelligence. This is the 'Clueless' makeover ('Clueless' was an update of Jane Austen's 'Emma'), and it works quite well.The one performance that never quite rings true is Andrew Keegan's as Joey, presumably the Hortensio role. He seems somehow too uncomfortable with the material to really sell it, and I have a hard time believing that this person was ever that popular. Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik, as the Stratford sisters, are both excellent. Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, in the Lucentio role (Cameron), is the best of the ensemble as he makes his play for Bianca. He is a fine actor, especially for one so young. It probably doesn't hurt that he's had some of the most experience of the young cast, starring in the hit sitcom 'Third Rock From the Sun.' David Krumholtz ('The Slums of Beverly Hills'), as Cameron's friend Michael, also turns in a funny, convincing performance.The one quibble I had with the picture was a mainly regional one: I live in Tacoma, Washington, where most of the picture was filmed; our town's historic Stadium High School was transformed into Padua High for the purposes of the screenplay. However, I was offended by the supposed premise that this picture takes place in Seattle. Shots of the Space Needle and Gasworks Park are clearly visible, side by side with shots of downtown Tacoma and ... Stadium High, one of the city's most famous landmarks. The view from the Stratford house is also plainly Commencement Bay (my own house is less than a mile away), and I question how the filmmakers could decide to be so blatantly ambiguous. Pick a city, folks.Apart from that, the movie was delightful enough, and a terrific date movie. Prepare yourself to laugh your sphincters off.",7,0,0,31 March 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Haunting, brilliant requiem by one of the masters
","I'm still in shock after seeing 'Eyes Wide Shut,' a haunting masterpiece of a film written, directed, and produced by one of film's great artists, Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick died just five days after showing his film, suggested by Arthur Schnitzler's novel 'Traumnovelle,' to Warner Bros. Thankfully, the studio has left most of Kubrick's vision intact, reportedly interfering with but a single scene. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is sexy, emotional, thrilling, and sickening - and brilliant. During the filming, which took over a year, the cast and crew were sworn to secrecy. Speculation and rumors ran wild about the husband-and-wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman: would there be a steamy sex scene? Or, even more intriguing: would we see Tom naked? All anyone really knew was that this was a sexy thriller, a la 'Basic Instinct.' An early rumor I heard was that Kubrick decided to shoot a porno movie using well-known actors and a good script. Well, forget anything you may have heard before - you're in for a shock.Put simply, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is not really about sex. Not that it isn't erotic - nearly every scene is alive with sexual energy - but there's a bigger game at stake than just the one played horizontally. This is a film about power, and the loss of power that comes with sexual situations. Tom Cruise, who plays Dr. Bill Harford, is disturbed when his wife Alice (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman) confesses having sexual thoughts about another man. Perhaps part revenge, part curiosity, he sets out on an odyssey to be unfaithful - but somehow, never succeeds. One is reminded of those characters in Greek mythology who were given the impossible tasks in Hades; one had to fill up a bucket with no bottom, and one had to constantly push a rock uphill that would always roll back down to the bottom. Dr. Harford is a man without power who nevertheless requires it - in most situations, his credentials give him power, but he discovers there are certain people he cannot impress simply by flashing his board card.One of these people is his wife - time and again, she takes the upper hand in their relationship. As Bill stumbles haplessly about New York, visions of Alice's infidelity flash through his mind. Much of his odyssey seems to stem from a 'This'll show her!' mindset rather than the cool, rational fa√ßade he wants us to see. In fact, nearly all of Bill's actions seem impulsive - from his decision to visit a whore's bedroom to his chance meeting with an old friend at a piano bar to the drive to the infamous manor house where the film's climax occurs. Dr. Harford is unable to exude power here, in the company of an exclusive group of lechers and courtesans. He is seen instantly as an imposter, and the message is clear: Only the powerful need remain.The specifics of the plot are not nearly as important as the film's ultimate message. Suffice to say, there is intrigue, murder, sex, drugs, and suspicion enough to keep even the most jaded moviegoer interested and guessing until the final scene. And, in keeping with the rest of the film, Cruise's character is not allowed to emerge victorious in the final reel - it is Alice who ultimately shows her strength and power, not Bill. 'Eyes Wide Shut,' as its title may imply, is full of ironies both large and small: the main character is an anti-hero, his every success doomed from the opening credits; a hooker has sociology textbooks on view in her apartment; a junkie and whore sacrifices herself to save another. What makes this movie so intriguing is that every scene, every moment captured on film, is so carefully constructed that we get the feeling we are standing just behind Bill, observing his tragic fall and even being drawn down with him.'Eyes Wide Shut' is an outstanding film, one that will be surely recognized by the Academy Awards. I would be very surprised indeed if Kubrick were not nominated posthumously for Best Director. In addition, it is rare indeed for a major studio release starring big-name stars to be an art film - and 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a work of art. Every light, every mask, every character - all come together in a stunning array of beauty, shock, and wisdom that makes me realize what a tragic loss Mr. Kubrick's death was. I've often said that Stanley Kubrick never made a bad film, and 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception. Disturbing, haunting, and shocking, it is also a beautiful, emotional, and masterful requiem by one of the great masters.",9,1,1,16 July 1999
