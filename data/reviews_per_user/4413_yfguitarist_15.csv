The Ring," Unbearably tense and creepy
","I saw this in theaters with my friends for my fifteenth birthday. I hadn't seen 'Ringu' and I still haven't. The whole time I was watching it, I thought, 'Man, this is creepy!'There are several jump scenes and an overall sense of dread throughout the film. It's dark and filled with disturbing imagery. (Possible spoiler) When the teenage girl was found in her closet, the collective audience screamed and talked for several minutes afterward. When Rachel was in the well near the end, the tension was almost unbearable. It was horrifying. When Samara came out of the TV, I wasn't shocked, because I had read about it before, but it was fun watching people around me shrink back into their seats and fling their hands in front of their faces. (end spoiler)When I walked out, I thought, 'Wow, that wasn't scary at all. Just creepy.'I expected to be terrified when I got home late at night, but I didn't think about it. Sometimes the images would pop into my head in the shower or at night, but that's about it. What I'm trying to say in this crappy review is that it's worth watching, for it certainly has an effect on the viewer. It might not terrify you, but I'm sure you'll remember it.",10,1,2,8 July 2004
The Hunger Games," Battle Royale Lite
","Not comparing this to Battle Royale is impossible - the premise is too similar to be ignored. I'm extremely biased as well, considering Battle Royale is one of my all-time favorite films/books/graphic novels. So let's get this rant out of the way: The Hunger Games takes the concept of Battle Royale and waters it down to a product more accessible to a wider audience, specifically the younger crowd. My biggest problem with this is it loses the impact of Battle Royale - a frightening, beautiful, orgiastic display of shocking violence and social commentary. What makes it so twisted is that the contestants are all fellow students and friends, and we get to know many of the students, making their deaths more disturbing. In The Hunger Games, we follow two contestants and the rest are nameless, and with the exception of one young black girl, their deaths are meaningless (and mostly off-screen). The fact that the violence is so much more tame seems irresponsible - we don't see how horrific and terrifying it would be. The characters in The Hunger Games are black-and-white, good and evil with no grey areas, whereas the characters in Battle Royale feature heroes, antiheroes, complete monsters, and terrified teens. They're plunged into a situation and act like normal teens would, freaking out, committing suicide, going ax crazy, professing love, etc.As a film, The Hunger Games is certainly not bad - it's a well-made, well-acted spectacle that is entertaining albeit predictable. It takes its time getting to the action, but when the contestants are finally released it's thrilling (there's also a particularly intense scene involving a wasp's nest). It's probably the best we can expect from what a predictable Hollywood remake of Battle Royale would look like - significantly toned down, with a gorgeous cast, and a soundtrack featuring Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, and a couple good indie bands (as opposed to Battle Royale's classical music). I also like that The Hunger Games focuses more on the media aspect of the game, which was mostly ignored in Battle Royale. It's much less melodramatic than Battle Royale as well. The bizarre costume designs are great too.TL;DR - It all comes down to taste. If you prefer fantasy stories, don't like subtitles, and have no desire to see kids kill each other in over-the-top gory fashion, you'll like The Hunger Games. If you're a fan of horror, exploitation, or extreme Asian cinema, you'll like Battle Royale. I prefer the latter, but The Hunger Games could've been a lot worse.",5,189,337,24 March 2012
Hostel," Don't believe all the negative hype
","I don't get why everyone made such a big fuss over this movie. From reading all the posts on here I expected the worst movie ever made. It's NOT a porno, the nudity is no worse than your average Road Trip or American Pie. The violence is nothing new (and mainly offscreen), although it is gorier than Saw, although that's not saying much. There is vomiting, for those of you that don't like that kind of stuff, but even that isn't too bad. If you've seen High Tension Unrated than this is a walk in the park. It's not as bad a movie as people make it seem. I think they were just expecting something great because QT's name was on it (although I'm not a fan of QT). People should just enjoy it as a horror flick. It could've been scarier, more intense, and had a better story. The trailer is much, much better.*spoiler* I didn't really care much for the main character getting revenge. Yes, if I was in his situation, I'd feel the same way, but the movie didn't make me feel his anger. Although it is satisfying to see the torturer's put in the victim's place, Breakdown does this much better.*end spoiler* There are many MUCH worse horror films out there. There are lots of better ones, too. I can see how one would be disturbed and horrified by the subject matter, for it's obviously not very light. The scenery of the basement is darkly reminiscent of Session 9. Some images could haunt some viewer's dreams if dwelled upon at night, particularly a shot where Paxton walks past several doors with people getting tortured. Really, though, you'll probably forget about this movie after you watch it but it's not a waste of time. Torture barely takes up much screen time at all, maybe less than 2 minutes. If it wanted to be more disturbing it should've placed the viewer in the torture chair and should've been relentless instead of a quick 1 minute clip and then the torture is over, with most of it not shown. Real life is much worse than this.",7,0,3,21 January 2006
Green Room," Masterful, brutal, and satisfying - a new favorite survival horror/thriller
","So intense and well-made in every department. Horrific, funny, disturbing, engaging, scary...it's been in my mind since I saw it four days ago. I can't wait to see it again. I loved Blue Ruin but felt the ending wasn't as strong as the rest of the film. Green Room on the other hand is more consistently excellent from beginning to end. The cast is great, the cinematography is beautiful, the writing and directing are brilliant, the editing is fast-paced, the use of sound and music are effective, the art direction/set design is claustrophobic, the violence is realistic and shocking. The more I think about it, the more I realize how smart and subversive it is.",9,4,10,3 May 2016
Orphan," Remarkably well-acted, darkly humorous, and effectively disturbing
","Dark, edgy, twisted, effective, clever, intense, and blackly comic - one of the best 'evil child' films I've seen. It's brilliantly cast - Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are top-notch as usual, but what really stood out where the natural performances director Jaume Collet- Serra was able to get from the child actors. Usually child actors are painful to watch, but 12- year-old Isabelle Fuhrman gives a terrifying, chilling performance that is worthy of praise. Aryana Engineer in her screen debut as the deaf little sister Max is adorable and almost steals the show in every scene. The stylish cinematography, editing, and sound are fantastic as well. I saw Orphan at a packed advance screening and the audience had a blast. Collet-Serra knows how to pull the strings and engage the audience, as they were screaming and laughing at all the right moments. There are plenty of fun and playful tension-relieving scenes, and several cathartic moments when the audience erupted into cheers. When the credits rolled the audience even applauded. The second showing I went to was just as receptive - the audience went nuts. They were collectively screaming, cheering, yelling at the screen, cringing, applauding, and enthusiastically welcoming the comic relief. One guy commented afterwards: 'I never get scared by movies but that was the scariest movie I've ever seen.' Audience participation for both screenings I went to were very high. The film improves upon second viewing, with the knowledge of the twist. I was able to focus more on details and clues, and the anticipation of my favorite scenes made for a much more rewarding experience. It's even more chilling and cathartic the second time around.It's far from perfect though - there are way too many predictable jump/false scares, with the soundtrack blaring to try to startle the viewer. The last part of the movie becomes a slasher flick replete with clichés and a one-liner. There is a talky scene where Esther reveals herself to her adoptive mother that is totally unneeded, as well as a crucial line regarding Danny, the older son, which really should've been cut. It's also a bit long at 2 hours - for an exploitative 'B' movie this is unusual, although time is devoted to character development. Esther is multi-dimensional and even sympathetic at times - I would love to see a prequel based on her character.Orphan is definitely not for kids - aside from the 'anti-adoption' angle, there is plenty of dangerous imitable behavior. The violence committed by and toward children is shocking, realistic, and brutal. This is a ballsy film that throws kids into horrific ordeals.It may be a 'B' movie, but it's a damn good one that knows its audience. The basic idea is nothing new (except for the unexpected twist), but you knew that from the trailer and synopsis. If you were still interested or if you're a horror fan that is able to look past some clichés and logical jumps in exchange for horrific chills, you'll have a fun time. The phenomenal child performances alone are enough to recommend Orphan.",8,213,289,22 July 2009
Silent Hill," Finally a horror movie that delivers
","I've been waiting for this kind of horror movie for quite some time. After being disappointed by the recent horror flicks (Hills Have Eyes, Hostel, Wolf Creek...) I was wondering if there ever would be another movie that suited my tastes. Only a few weeks ago I commented that I would love to see a horror film that isn't restrained, and creepy enough to give me the chills, one that wouldn't feature mindless gore but one that used gore in a horrifying manner (particularly in front of many witnesses), and yet one that blended this with atmosphere, story, and tension without relying on jump scenes.Tonight (opening night) I got my wish. The first showing (9:40 pm) was sold out so I sat with my friends in a fairly crowded 10:15 showing. There were occasional bouts of laughter at unintentionally funny parts (bad acting, bizarre music choices), but methinks it was mainly to relieve tension, because at several scenes the laughter abruptly stopped and the audience sat in silence or reacted with 'Holy sh*t...' with mingled screams. This was particularly evident at the finale, which was built up to the entire movie for a very intense scene in which no one laughed and people were shocked at how far the director went. Some special effects early on are fake-looking, but the climax more than makes up for all the other faults. The soundtrack and imagery is beautiful as well.I haven't reacted like this to a horror movie since I was a child. There are several atmospheric scenes that are nightmarish and reminiscent of Asian horror, and there are scenes that feature fountains of unflinching gore and tension that actually manage to horrify and awe the viewer without unnecessary jump scenes.My girlfriend commented as we walked out, 'That was such a messed up movie...I couldn't watch it' and she was one of the 'laughers'. I overheard 'Worst movie ever! It didn't make sense!' and 'Best movie ever! F*ckin' awesome!' I'm glad this wasn't a PG-13 movie.I'd say this is my favorite horror movie of all time, along with The Shining, Les Diaboliques, The Eye, and The Ring. I was very satisfied.",9,2,4,21 April 2006
Blades of Glory," Too late
","Blades of Glory would've been much funnier if I was still in junior high, or if it had come out before Anchorman, Napoleon Dynamite, Ricky Bobby, Zoolander, etc. I'm a college sophomore. Anchorman is one of my favorite comedies, as well as Napoleon Dynamite. I also love Arrested Development and The Office. Ricky Bobby was a step down, but still has its hilarious moments. Blades of Glory was awful. I laughed once or twice, but most of the jokes were just so annoying in that sense that they'd been used so many times and could've been written by, well, a junior high school student. It's like they tried to imitate what was funny about the earlier Will Ferrell movies but did so poorly. That style of humor had just become tired and overused by the time this came out and it was no longer amusing. It might be worth watching if you're with friends for a chuckle, but you'd probably be better off just talking to each other and laughing at each other...or watching Superbad.",4,2,4,31 August 2007
Closer," Love is war
","The first time I watched this, I didn't think it was amazing, but the second time I watched it, it blew me away. It's a deeply layered character study from the director of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (another excellent character study). It plays like a play, which makes sense, because it's based on a play. The acting was amazing (although I'm surprised Jude Law and Julia Roberts weren't recognized...I'm glad Natalie Portman was, as she was probably the strongest actor, but Clive Owen I felt was the weakest, although he was convincing). I can see why some people may not like it, as the plot consists of its main characters deceiving each other and selfishly destroying each other's lives. Some experience karma, others don't. It's very realistic and the emotions are high and raw. There are many reversals - every character experiences what the others experience at different points. The characters are very flawed, complex, self-contradictory, and very human. There are many themes - truth, betrayal, deception, guilt, love, forgiveness, the horrible things we do for love, the tremulous nature of love, etc.The screenplay doesn't insult the viewer. The dialogue is fantastic - almost every line is a double entendre. It's a moving, funny, beautiful, heartbreaking experience, if you're willing to sit through the graphic sexual dialogue. It may take repeated viewings to capture every bit of dialogue, every emotion portrayed on screen, every subtle nuance, every reversal, every metaphor...I don't really have a good ending to this review, so just watch it.",9,0,2,13 July 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Best camera-work since The Blair Witch Project
","I've tried, 3 times, to like these movies, but I just can't. One of the main reasons people love these movies is because Jason Bourne is a badass! And he doesn't take no for an answer! If you like Rambo/Arnold/Bond movies and don't care about story or plot holes or logistics, you'll probably love this movie (not that there's anything wrong with that). But it's so full of clichés and absurdity I couldn't help but cringe and fall asleep (literally, and I rarely fall asleep during movies, especially not action thrillers). The biggest groan from me came when Bourne looks at the blood on his hands and acts sad for all the people he's killed, in a pathetic, clichéd attempt at a three-dimensional character. Why is it so hard to get a camera man that can keep the camera from shaking for more than 2 seconds? Even when Bourne is buying a newspaper, there are 20 cuts, zooms, and shakes! The action and story takes suspension of disbelief to a whole new level. What a waste of time...The only reason it gets a star is for the scene where Bourne steals a cop car while the man who is after him distracts the police by shooting at him.",1,21,37,4 August 2007
District 9," An over-hyped, manipulative, and clichéd wasted opportunity
","Over-hyped, overrated, badly written, badly shot, badly acted, and badly directed. The writing is manipulative, clichéd, and relies on dues ex machina and coincidence. The first 20 minutes is 'documentary' footage and interviews, which starts off interestingly with thought- provoking social commentary, even though the shaky camera-work is very annoying (it doesn't improve). What could've been a compelling and intelligent science fiction classic turns into a dumb, ridiculous, laughable action flick that has plenty of crowd-pleasing mayhem. Once the action starts and the MacGuffin is introduced the social commentary is thrown out the window and becomes generic and stereotypical. The action is done well, though. It's entertaining, gory, and satisfying. This is pure nerd-fantasy, with cool weapons, tough guy shouting, and a kickass robot suit. In an effort to obtain realism apparently, none of the actors are recognizable. This could've worked if they hadn't have been terrible (except for the lead). The characters are shallow and one-dimensional. The antihero is entirely unlikeable which makes for low suspense because you don't care if he lives or dies. The only sympathetic characters are (predictably) the aliens, who are more human than the humans. I was hoping they ended up destroying all humans. The story is somewhat unpredictable and original, so it deserves credit for that. But don't expect a masterpiece like the critics and fans are raving about.",4,41,90,17 August 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Laughable
","Wow. This was atrocious. Unbelievably bad. Embarrassing. There's literally 20 minutes of action and an hour and 40 minutes of stupidity. The action scenes are the most ridiculous, over-the-top, comedic, absurd, preposterous action scenes ever filmed. I laughed out loud several times. EVERYTHING explodes when Cruise shoots it...EVERYTHING - don't be surprised if you see wooden chairs exploding in this movie. Cruise does the most pointless stunts imaginable, like dragging his feet on the side of a motorcycle (COOL!!!!??) and doing nose wheelies across the street on his motorcycle (NEAT!!!!!) I was actually waiting for Cruise to do a dance after his K.O. on the sand, take off his glasses, crush them under his foot, then wink at the camera and do a thumbs up just in case. Cruise is also a master fighter, gunman, base jumper, biker, driver, and all-around perfect guy.Bad guys chase after Cruise, who is actually invincible in this movie, and die left and right in bloodless, painless deaths. It actually makes violence fun and cool! The bad guys outnumber Cruise and unload hundreds of bullets and can't even come close to hitting him, yet Cruise can do barrel rolls off of motorcycles while shooting his gun and blowing up trucks with ease. I was hoping he would've been blindfolded - wouldn't have been implausible. This might appeal to a 9-year-old. That seems to be the target audience. The 2-disc DVD has almost 10 minutes of bonus features! There's a skit, some awards show excerpts, and a very short documentary. That's it. Real pathetic cash-in. The only reason it was released is to add the M:I-3 teaser. Boo.",1,11,23,12 October 2006
Pulp Fiction," The hilarious misadventures in the life of a pair of murderers!
","Describe Pulp Fiction in one word: impossible. Because it's impossible to describe it one word, so I'll use many: a complex, interwoven modern day fable with characters as colorful as an Alice in Wonderland rendition. This film, on the surface, appears to merely be an exploitation flick, mindless in its execution and gratuitous in its violence. On the contrary! The violence, while shocking, serves the purpose of jolting us out of our everyday life - it speaks to us, and ABOUT us, in ways that your average Hollywood popcorn movie can. We get to see the humour in murder. Injected with black as night humour, it tells the tale of a group of criminals 'behind-the-scenes.' We see their everyday conversations, fueled by intellect, wit, and poetry, debunking the stereotype that murderers are devoid of any real intelligence. Pulp Fiction is a film for the ages.In all honesty, I gave this film a low score because it's ridiculously overrated. Personally, I can't stand hearing QT's pretentious dialogue and the 'look-how-cool-I-am' style really grates on my nerves. It's pretty popular to like this movie, so maybe I just have to hate everything popular, but that's obviously not the case, so...I don't know what it is. Mass brainwashing and hysteria over this egotist that likes to write himself into cool parts in his films so he can suck women's toes?",6,8,23,31 January 2007
The Untouchables," The Unbelievables
","I can't believe how this is rated so high. It's laughably bad. The soundtrack composed for the film is inappropriate and clunky. The dialogue is forced and corny. The acting, minus De Niro, is atrocious. My brother and I laughed at almost everything that came out of Connery's and Costner's mouths. We couldn't believe Connery was even nominated for an award. It has the feel of a play/TV/B-movie/melodrama. It's unrealistic and you don't care for any of the characters. There is an interesting gunfight and opera scene. The best part about this movie is the trailer, which is misleading and makes it look like a great film. I chose this over Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs, Scarface (which I don't think I'll be checking out now), and Casino. Bleh.",2,42,76,2 August 2005
30 Days of Night," Best partial beheading...ever!
","I'll start withThe bad:-It starts off slow in what may have been an attempt to build atmosphere and character development, but it didn't really work for me. -The random kills scattered through the first half weren't great, either. I would've rather seen a single shot of the action instead of many jump cuts - it would've been much more disturbing and horrifying. -The token little (vampire) girl saying, 'Wanna play with me?' was a failed attempt to be scary. It could've earned points for showing her get killed on screen. -The vampires' dialogue was cheesy.The good: -Easily the best decapitation I've ever seen in a film, horror or otherwise. The camera is right in there for the best possible shot, and the make-up effects are flawless and incredibly realistic. Up until this point the gore had been lacking, but this made it all worthwhile for a gore aficionado like myself. Really - it knocks DAY OF THE DEAD out of my previous top gore scene. -Like Slade's previous film, HARD CANDY, it was shot beautifully. Several shots reminded me of paintings - stylish, morbid paintings. -One particularly impressive overhead shot carries you over a street of the town as vampires slay their prey in splashes of blood against the snow. -The beautiful ending (I won't give it away). I wasn't expecting to be moved as much as I was.30 DAYS OF NIGHT was definitely worth seeing. I'll probably buy it when it comes out on DVD. It's safe to say that this is the most well-made vampire movie I've seen (although I haven't seen many). I have a feeling that it'll be ranked up there with the heavyweight hard- hitting survival horror films one day, such as DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE THING.",6,1,3,24 October 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Not what I expected...
","I was expecting an epic horror drama romance film and instead got a low-budget hurried movie. The director made The Godfather...what the heck is this? Positives:-Great score -Costumes -Some effective scenes of violence and imagery (particularly a decrepit Dracula floating around in his castle with shadows that follow him, and a nightmarish undead Lucy in a doll- like gown) -Anthony Hopkins -Gary OldmanNegatives:-Crappy special effects and makeup -scenes seem to be edited together for no particular reason creating a jumbled mess -baaad writing -over the top melodrama (who cares that this evil man that killed thousands of people is dead? i certainly didn't feel for mina) -HORRIBLE acting by Keanu Reeves. I didn't go in expecting a horrible performance, heck, I was hopeful -WTF! Winona Ryder was terrible! -the excellent score could've been used in an explosive, powerful climax -too bad the climax falls flat on its face. Dracula pops out of the carriage and I'm like YES! Something's happening! The fight takes about 3 seconds and we're left with a scene where some nobody is dead and everyone's crying",2,5,8,23 July 2006
