Hereditary," Generous score . Don't believe the hype
",I deliberately didn't read any reviews on this film before watching it last night. Now I have and would recommend anyone watching it to read some reviews which explain the film and storyline. Some great acting and some great scenes . But in my opinion more of a drama/thriller than a horror. Very slow burning and even when it does get going it's still slow. I love horror films but recently none seem to be what I'd class as a horror film. During this film a lot of people laughed at some scenes. A lot of people after also said how disappointed they were in it. Originally a three hour film which would be interesting to see if it explained it a bit better in three hours. Read some reviews first before you go,4,1,3,16 June 2018

Hostel," slow film....better towards the end
","Couldn't wait to see this after hearing so much about it... had read a few bad reviews and some pretty good ones so decided to give it a go today. I had been told that the beginning had plenty of topless women and that the three main guys were good times guys out for free sex with anything and everything. Why did the one guy seem to have a thing about his ex yet soon got down to it at the 'Hostel' Seems a bit of an odd thing to add to the storyline when it made no difference to the way he acted. About forty minutes into the film I was feeling a bit let down. as usual an American film with fresh looking good looking slim people who aren't too bright. BUT it does get better. The one torturer seemed a bit odd and kept hyperventilating and eventually gets killed. The Achilles heel part was pretty gory and i couldn't help saying 'Yuck'. And it gorier.The oriental girl and the eye part was pretty gory, and i laughed at the scene with the people waiting for the train and how they get splattered with blood when she jumps in front of the train...great bit. And the guy in the car when his head was being smashed by the stones. one of the bits looked really realistic. I love a good horror film or a scary film and would probably watch this again but do feel it was over hyped in the adverts about it. Tarantino should stick to the kind of films he is famous for, this won't be one of them. The ending in my view could mean maybe a second one. They have his passport so know him and may follow him to kill him rather than him tell people about the hostel/killings/police etc etc.",7,2,3,30 March 2006
Ready Player One," Great film
","Just seen an a preview and thoroughly enjoyed. Haven't read the books and only knew a little about the film. Would definitely recommend watching in it 3D. Great special effects, bit of humour and a great film. 2hrs 20 mins so a long waych but doesn't drag at all",9,8,30,20 March 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Wow a must see
","Absolutely loved it. Great cast. Especially the Actor who played Freddie. Him to a tee. Great seeing how they got together. Their ups and downs as a band. Sad to see Freddie's loneliness at times, struggles with fame and his sexuality. The end 15/20 mins fantastic. Found myself tapping my feet along, singing along, laughing and getting emotional. Queen have made some fantastic tracks and lovely their music is still around. Highly recommend this to anyone",10,1,3,28 October 2018
The Hills Have Eyes," not bad
","I love the original film. Michael Berryman was a scary guy and he to me is Hills Have Eyes. hen i heard they were doing a new one i couldn't wait to see it at the cinema. It was a slow start, too many scenes of the desert and the mines. Also too much on the nuclear testing years before, i don't' recall much on that in the original but i suppose all re makes change a few bits of the film. The Cannabals weren't quite as scary and a bit shocking to see the young children towards the end of the film. What happened to them? The rape scene isn't as bad as some have said and has kept to the original script again. What started as a slow film got really gory and quite jumpy. A few bits were a bit unbelievable, the Hero Dad rescuing his daughter after so many beatings...even though he had been portrayed as a bit of a wimp. I love horror films and love to be scared but too many films use killings/violence as a a way to scare you, to me the unknown and the not knowing what is going to happen next is scarier. All in all for someone who hasn't seen the first one then they will probably enjoy it but i would suggest watching the first one too. Glad Wes Cravern was involved in this film again.",6,0,0,14 March 2006
Yesterday," Loved it.Must see film
","Took my mum tonight . Wow we loved it. Great acting, story, characters and music. Made me laugh, sing and feel good. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a feel good film. Danny Boyle delivers like he always delivers",10,0,2,2 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Edge of your seat thriller
",Great film. Found myself holding my breath waiting for the next sound or jump. Strange watching such a quiet film but definitely worth a watch.,8,2,4,8 April 2018
The Descent," not bad
","not a bad film. jumpy at times and quite gory. great for a British horror film....roll on some more of these. the scary guys reminded me a bit too much of the creep in creep but apart from that quite original.the ending was a bit poor but the rest of the film was fine. at times i thought maybe they could have done a bit more with the married guy affair part of it but all in all it was watchable. Bit jumpy at times and not bad attempt for a British film. Couldn't work out where i had seen the irish girl beofre. She;'s been in coronation street recently as Steve MacDonalds love interest. Other girls i thought i recognised but after some research i don't know them at all. worth a watch with plenty of darkness and quiet, probably best in a cinema",8,0,1,27 July 2005
Joker," Mesmerising
",Wow dark gritty and thought provoking. So much going on. Absolutely loved it. Totally engrossed in every scene. One of the best acting roles I've seen in years. Joacquin Phoenix is top class . Plan to see this again üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,10,1,1,6 October 2019
The Greatest Showman," Entertaining. Fantastic film
","Have seen this ten times now including the sing a longs. As soon as it starts it draws you In to a film filled with great
Music and a lovely story. Critics have criticised it. The public have made their own opinion and loved it. One of the best musicals ever made. A feel good movie that all the family will love and want to see again and again",10,3,7,14 March 2018
Green Book," Great film
","Just seen this at a secret screening. Had heard a bit about it before. Wasn't too sure what to expect. Based on a true story about a friendship forming between two unlikely one people. Loved it. Made me laugh, cry, cringe at how coloured people were treated in the 50s. Loved the acting. Wait around for the credits as they tell you a bit more about them and photos of them both. Well worth a watch when it's out",9,4,10,5 December 2018
