The New World," 'Moulin Rouge' in buckskin
","The plot and acting provided a nice framework for the cinematography without being interesting enough or noteworthy enough to interfere with the visuals.The only saving grace to the plot and acting is that it doesn't plunge into the realm of overly wild historical myth. Of course, when you have a film mostly made up of two people staring at each other and uttering what are supposed to be meaning-laden, character-revealing simple sentences every fifteen minutes or so, the writers couldn't have gotten into too much trouble with the history of it all. Don't bother turning the volume up; the scenes are stunning, but all that's worthwhile in this movie. 'Moulin Rouge' in buckskin.",4,0,4,14 May 2006
