The Rock," Unashamedly OTT!
","The Rock is an unashamedly absurd and over-the-top action thriller, and I loved it. I loved the fact that it made no pretences at maintaining a believable plot line and focused entirely on edge-of-the-seat action.Nicholas Cage is superb as the nerdy chemist turned action hero, while Sean Connery puts it a deft turn as the cool British ex- spy.The movie hits you with sequence after sequence of fast-paced action and edgy encounters that keep things ticking along at a nice pace.My only criticism is that the final sequence, where Cage and Connery have to diffuse a series of rockets, could have been ratcheted up a couple more gears. I'd have liked to have seen more evidence of why Connery's character had such a feared reputation, while more could have been done to instill a sense of mortal danger from the chemical weapons.But this is quibbling. The Rock is a excellent movie that I'd thoroughly recommend. Pure, mindless entertainment at its best.",8,1,1,29 October 2013
The Avengers," Fun to watch
","I did like the idea of a movie that brought a bunch of familiar superheroes together, and to be fair they did a pretty good job of this.Iron Man, Hawkeye, the Hulk, Thor, Loki, Captain America and Black Widow all get their fair share of screen time and they're all excellent. And there's some great moments of interaction. The fight between Thor and the Hulk was my personal favourite.But unfortunately the story was second- rate: a bad guy brings an army to destroy the earth and the avengers can only stop him if they (wait for it)... work as a team.Boring.Worst of all, Loki was the bad guy. This is the 'trickster' of the Norse gods, a character who is just perfect for a complex, which-side-is-he-on storyline packed with plot twists, and instead they just make him head of an army of demons. It's a missed opportunity.Avengers Assemble is plenty of fun to watch but it's not the great movie it might have been.",7,0,3,27 December 2015
Black Swan," Terrifying
","Not the type of movie I would normally go for. It felt so predictable - pretty ballet star sleeps with director to further her career. Even with great performances by Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel (and they are great performances), I was ready for this film to slowly and uninterestingly meander down a familiar path.Well, I have to say it surprised me.First there's the deftly managed subplot of Portman's relationship with her mother, who is a suffocating presence, jealous of her daughter and possessive in the extreme. It sets an uneasy backdrop for what follows.And then there's the imagery. At least it starts as imagery - the dichotomy between the white swan and the black swan, innocence and experience. But then it comes to take over the movie, which becomes a partly allegorical and partly psychological metaphor.Portman actually becomes the black swan embodied. It's incredibly and painfully realistic and yet so obviously absurd. It's a terrifying, unsettling and saddening experience.Still not my 'type' of film but very unique and - I have to admit it - excellent really.",7,0,2,26 October 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Forgettable but excellent!
","A strong movie in the series. The action is pretty constant and of high quality throughout. But its real strength comes from Philip Seymour Hoffman who is excellent as the ruthless, suave, in-control bad guy.The curious thing about Mission Impossible III is despite being very good it's the most easily forgettable of the series. I think this is because of the plot - which centres round the theft of a 'rabbit's foot' but we never really find out what the rabbit's foot is.Highlights include Cruise jumping on the roofs of skyscrapers, electrocuting himself, and plenty of good old face-mask trickery. It's delightful viewing.",7,4,4,19 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not good enough
","My least favourite Star Wars movie. It has one good performance - Liam Neeson as a Jedi knight. Everyone else is either mediocre or just plain bad. Ewan McGregor puts in a naive performance as a perpetually grinning Jedi apprentice. The bad guy is an absurd red- faced devil creature called Darth Maul. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, a ridiculously clumsy but 'goodhearted' alien.But this is not a terrible movie. There's pleasure in seeing the origins of the Star Wars saga, familiar characters appearing like R2-D2, Obi-Wan Kenobe and Yoda, and the origins of later characters like Darth Vader.There are some decent fight scenes, including a pretty cool double- edged light-sabre fight between the Jedi and Darth Maul, and interesting politics playing out in the Senate of the Republic.This is not the Episode I that the Star Wars saga deserved, but it's just about watchable.",6,0,1,19 June 2016
The Expendables 2," Shameless gun-toting fun
","I enjoyed The Expendables 2 more than the first movie. Mainly because the action scenes are more over-the-top, ridiculous feasts of gun-toting violence than ever before.The movie starts with an excellent sequence in which The Expendables break into a fortress to rescue a prisoner. There's tanks, soldiers, explosions, daring escapes, planes, etc. And it never really lets up there on in.Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger feature more than in the first movie so it really is an all star cast.Like the original Expendables, this movie is completely absurd, lacks virtually any moral compass, and has a shamelessly clichéd plot, but it's great fun.",6,1,1,9 December 2015
Source Code," It's OK
","I was looking forward to watching this after seeing another Jake Gyllenhaal movie but I have to admit I was disappointed. Gyllenhaal puts in a good performance as the hero of this Sci-Fi mystery but the film itself didn't live up to expectations.The premise of the plot is perfectly good - a man is sent back in time to the scene of a train-crash to work out whodunnit. The problem is a) you never feel like Gyllenhaal's character is put in any real danger (this is not an edge-of-the-seat number) and b) the mystery proves remarkably easy to resolve when he actually puts his mind to it. There is so much more they could have done with the plot to make things more interesting.The movie is partially redeemed by a sub-plot in which Gyllenhaal tries to uncover the truth behind the motives of the people he is working for - this adds a bit of interest. But the fact is that without Gyllenhaal's performance, Source Code would be seriously mediocre. As it is, it's OK.",6,1,2,7 March 2014
Iron Man 3," A little disappointed
","I was a teeny weeny bit disappointed with this after having seen the previous movie in the series. Whereas Iron Man 2 is a light-hearted affair, Iron Man 3 tries to be (a little bit) more sinister and gritty and I felt as a result it fell a little wide of the mark.Robert Downey Jr is still excellent as Iron Man and there are still plenty of genuinely funny moments. It's the bad guys that let this down for me. Iron Man 2 went for a mad, bad, caricature of a bad guy that provided a perfect foil to Downey Jr's quirky Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, they went for a genius sinister scientist type that probably suited a James Bond move more than this.Still, a good showpiece finale made it largely worth it.",6,1,3,25 May 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Harrison Ford was born for this movie
","Harrison Ford really puts in a brilliant performance in this movie. No one else could pull off the swashbuckling hero with such poise and confidence. It's like he was born for the role. My favourite part of the whole movie is that opening sequence where he is rescuing a golden idol from a booby-trapped cave - it encapsulates everything I imagine Indiana Jones to be about. Karen Allen also deserves a mention for a great supporting performance as the bolshy heroine Marion Ravenwood.But despite the classic performances this isn't my favourite India Jones movie. I think it loses its way at times. The scene where Marion puts on a white dress and drinks Belloq under the table is presented as a pivotal moment but doesn't seem to lead to anything. And towards the end of the movie, the scenes on the U-Boat feel disjointed from the rest of the plot. Others will disagree, but overall I prefer Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade.I don't want to be too harsh, mind. I really do love this movie. There are scenes such as the pit of snakes and the car/tank chase that rank among the best in the Indiana Jones franchise. A very enjoyable viewing.",7,0,1,7 January 2014
Gravity," Wow
","A fantastic edge-of-the-seat thriller set in spectacularly realistic- looking SPACE. How could I not like this movie? I had high expectations and I'm pleased to say those expectations were all met.I'm not usually a Sandra Bullock fan but I have to say she was superb in this as the indefatigable heroine Ryan Stone. George Clooney was definitely second-best.The plot is totally ridiculous. It revolves around an absurd plan to escape from a space disaster by a series of impossible hops between various craft that are all on their last legs. But who cares - it makes for one hell of a thriller. This is genuine edge-of-the-seat stuff from beginning to end. The 91 minutes positively race by.And OK this movie isn't exactly profound or even original. The dialogue is full of chirpy platitudes and American bravado. But again, who cares? Not me. I loved it!",8,2,5,3 August 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Bit fragmented but enjoyable
","I did enjoy this movie, although it is a little bit fragmented and the 'message' (if there is one) is rather confusing.It's certainly unique. It's great to see a modern movie that isn't frightened to operate in different languages and make a real effort to understand and represent other countries' cultures.It's also great to see a war movie that focuses on some surprising and quirky settings and characters - the scenes in a bar and in a cinema are excellent.Best of all, Christoph Waltz's performance as Hans Landa, the 'Jew Hunter', is simply superb as I think many others have said. Brad Pitt does a good job too.The problem is that the great scenes and performances aren't joined up into a coherent or compelling story. It is basically a revenge plot (like other Tarantino movies) and invites you to glory in the Jews getting one over the Nazis in an alternative-history storyline, but it didn't have any depth or complexity. The ending is bit too neat and satisfying for a movie about WW2.All in all I did enjoy it but I wouldn't list this under Tarantino's greatest movies.",7,0,0,22 August 2014
Iron Man 2," Highly enjoyable
","I rather enjoyed this. I hadn't seen the first Iron Man when I watched this and I was pleasantly surprised by how well suited Robert Downey Jr was to this role. His character is carefree, quirky, irresponsible and genuinely funny, the opposite of what you'd expect from the suit of armour. It makes the movie sufficiently tongue in cheek that you can enjoy the action without having to worry about the plot line being too serious. Just goes to show what getting the right actor can do for a movie.Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson provide plenty of female interest to the proceedings. And then there's Mickey Rourke, who performs brilliantly as a mad, brawny Russian bad guy with plenty of character, who outwits everyone else in the movie. Excellent stuff.This is a light hearted affair but really enjoyable.",7,1,3,21 May 2015
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Enjoyable, fun, quirky comedy
","I thought this was a really enjoyable movie, a cut above your average US comedy drama.Jason Segel plays the hapless central character quite brilliantly - a guy who's been left by his superstar girlfriend and is struggling to move on, and bumps into her again in Hawaii. He's supported well by the cast of Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Russell Brand.The plot is as you'd except - he is finds someone else, let's her down, then makes up for it. But it's Segel that make this that bit more enjoyable. Segel's character is writing a Dracula musical with puppets - and sings a number from it to woo the girl. He befriends virtually everyone he meets in Hawaii, including Brand's character who stole his girlfriend. He cries out loud - often.It's basically, a nice, quirky comedy with the odd bit of toilet humour that motors along quite pleasantly. I really enjoyed it.",7,0,2,15 April 2014
Zootopia," Immerse yourself in a fabulous animated world
","Zootropolis is a well-crafted Disney tale, with a simple moral message about not stereotyping other people. It's a really good movie.The main character Judy Hopps, a police bunny, and her side-kick, a fox called Nick Wilde, live in a world where animals (well, mammals anyway) have evolved and become civilised. These two main characters are probably not Disney's most memorable creations, but they do a decent job at the heart of the movie.What's really good about Zootropolis is the huge supporting cast - there are some fantastic characters among them. The two that stuck out for me were Flash, the sloth, who is helpful but painfully slow, and Mr. Big, a shrew who turns out to be a mafia godfather. There are many many others.Disney also do a great job with the landscapes and cityscapes that make up Zootropolis. There's loads of detail and it all looks fabulous. It all makes for a full and diverse imaginary world that is easy to get lost in for an hour and forty minutes with the family. A real treat.",8,9,17,9 April 2016
Argo," A flop
","A story about people escaping from Iran by pretending to be a SciFi film crew? A great concept for a movie! Initially I didn't realise this was based on a true story. I thought it was just someone's quirky take on a espionage thriller. It just goes to show that fact is often stranger than fiction.Shame then that the execution of the movie was poor. Ben Affleck failed singularly to create any real tension throughout, bar a half- decent scene at the airport in which the Americans almost get caught at the last hurdle.I think the biggest problem is that there's too little focus on the diplomats trapped in Iran - who should have been the main and most interesting characters. After a superb opening scene which features the Iranian Revolution, the focus switches to the US and the production of the fake SciFi film. Various Hollywood characters are introduced such as fake producers, that seemed boringly superfluous to me.By the time Affleck makes it to Iran, all pace has been lost from the movie and it's never really regained. The scenes in Iran, which mainly consist of the diplomats arguing with Affleck about whether his plan is a good idea, turn out to be dull. Yes I know it's supposed to be true to life, but it's rather short on thrills and spills.All in all in my view this movie was a flop.",5,1,1,3 August 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Mediocre I'm afraid
","I really enjoyed the first Star Trek re-make, but I'm afraid Into Darkness didn't do it for me. It felt like just more of the same. In some senses, that's OK. The characters were played well and were completely believable as younger versions of the original Star Trek cast. And the sets and special effects were top notch. That's great.But there's so much in this movie which is second rate. The storyline is insufferably dull and predictable. The bad guy, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, isn't half as sinister as he should be. The 'love interest', if there is a love interest, in Alice Eve, barely features. And the last minute 'save the world' climax is a parody of a decent disaster movie. All in all there's too much wrong with Into Darkness and I'm afraid it ends up being rather mediocre.",5,2,4,3 January 2014
Terminator Salvation," A good effort but where is Arnold Schwarnegger?
","I knew from the outset that Salvation wasn't going to be as good as the first two Terminator movies, purely because Terminator is all about Arnold Scharwenegger and this movie didn't feature him. So I was half expecting Salvation to be a bit of a flop.I have to admit that it exceeded my expectations. It certainly isn't at the level of the originals, but Christian Bale made this movie work with a great turn as John Conner, and the 'machines' made up an excellent supporting cast. The inclusion of a half-human half-robot character played by Sam Worthington worked surprisingly well too, and there were decent performances from Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter and Anton Yelchin.Another thing that helped is how closely the writers stuck to the original stories and mythology of the original movies. Terminator Salvation fleshes out things from Terminator 1 and 2 like the relationship between Kyle Rees and John Connor, the development of the Terminator models, and how Sarah Connor recorded advice for John on a Dictaphone.A good effort. Now let's hope from the next one they bring Schwarzenegger back properly!",7,1,4,13 June 2014
The Day After Tomorrow," Thrilling weather-related destruction
","I enjoyed this much more than I expected to. The plot is of course absurd - the idea that an Ice Age could descend in 48 hours surely can't have helped the climate lobby's credibility much.But that aside, it's a rather good disaster movie. The special effects are spectacular. It had me enthralled throughout. There's storms, tornadoes, floods, snow and rampaging wolves. You really couldn't ask for more.The plot follows a pretty standard structure. Father-son relationship and boy-meets-girl fare.But you watch this to be thrilled by the power of the weather, and on that it delivers in style.",7,0,0,19 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Brilliant
","Another superb movie from the original Star Wars trilogy.I watched this thinking it must surely fall short of the brilliance of the first two movies, but it most certainly did not.It introduces yet more weird and wonderful iconic aliens into the mix - most notably the grotesque Jabba the Hut and the adorable Ewoks.It matches the other movies for thrilling set piece battle scenes, culminating in the excellent space battle between rebel forces and the Imperial Destroyers and Death Star.Best of all, it delivers superbly on the ever evolving relationship between Luke, Darth Vader and the Emperor. The scenes toward the end where the Emperor tries to persuade Luke to turn to the dark side, and Luke simultaneously tries to get Vader to turn back, are deftly managed and quite terrifying.Oh, and we're treated with all the usual delightful characters of Leia, Solo, C3PO, R2-D2 et al.The only time the movie does show its age is in some of the initial scenes where alien monsters are shown using unconvincing stop-motion techniques. Fortunately there's less of these as the movie goes on.Return of the Jedi is yet another piece of brilliance from the Star Wars franchise.",9,1,2,29 June 2016
The Expendables," So-so
","Enjoyable in small doses but overall as pointlessly unoriginal as you'd expect.This movie is basically founded on the premise that if you put together as ensemble cast of action heroes from Stallone's phone book, what could possibly go wrong?Makes sense to me.But sadly, I discovered that without a half-decent plot to speak of (I've honestly forgotten what the 'plot' was meant to be - something about drugs in Mexico I think) or any real originality in the action sequences, watching Stallone, Jason Statham and Jet Li kick ass repeatedly actually can be rather dull. I must be getting old.It's an OK way to wile a way an evening I suppose, if you've got it to hand and there's nothing else on. That's as much as I can say in its favour.",5,0,0,26 October 2014
Begin Again," Cute enough
","A cute movie about the music industry. It reminded me of Once, except it's not as powerful or heartrending as that film.It sustained my interest. There's something irresistible about the clichéd concept of the artist sticking it to the recording studios and doing things their way. It's a slick production but it created the feel of an indie creation and the music is actually quite good.Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are strong as the leads. Beyond them the supporting cast is weak. Adam Levine is dull as Knightley's partner. James Corden is typecast. Hailee Steinfeld is OK as the sullen teenager.The plot is a bit narrow. We follow the hastily put together band through their recording of an album outdoors but there's not much in the way of setbacks or problems so it doesn't ever engage the heart.Like I said, it's all very cute but it's difficult to find much to say by way of praise beyond that.",6,1,2,12 April 2015
Alien," Perfect Sci-Fi Horror
","This is a fantastic Sci-Fi horror. It ticks every box. The dark, Gothic horror and suspense builds wonderfully. The alien is genuinely frightening and biologically convincing, when it could easily have looked absurd. The plot is simple, perfectly so. The cast are great - particularly Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm.The real mark of genius, though, is the way the characters get picked off one - by one - by one. It keeps you guessing, and right to the death it's not obvious who will be the last survivor, or even if there will be a last survivor. Downsides? The special effects are, unsurprisingly, ageing. Mostly this is covered up by the fact that we're deliberately only given brief glimpses of the alien. But occasionally the facade slips. For example, there's a scene right at the end where the alien is on the outside of a space-craft and looks like it's being carried around on a piece of string.But special effects will always age and that can be forgiven. It doesn't detract from a movie that fully achieves what it sets out do - keep you enthralled and on the edge of your seat the whole way through.",8,3,5,16 September 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Much better than the first Captain America movie
","I was disappointed by the first Captain America film, so I was pleased that I found myself liking 'The Winter Soldier'.Director Fury has a prominent role - he is hounded out of his position and almost killed. So Captain America finds himself in a position where he doesn't know who to trust. That said, he seems to trust Black Widow, who he quickly teams up with and who also features heavily in this movie.And that's just the start of it. Together, Captain America and Black Widow uncover a truly sinister secret at the heart of the organisation they work for.It's all delivered with perfectly good fight scenes and character interaction throughout. The sinister plot is unravelled at a steady pace, meaning it's easy to stay interested right up to the climax.My major criticism is that I don't find the characters all that engaging. Captain America is a boringly clean-cut hero, and the bad guys didn't seem very memorable.",7,0,1,17 July 2016
Interstellar," Spectacular, moving, yet disappointing
","An impressive spectacle. A moving SciFi drama. And yet a bit of a disappointment.The arc of the plot is clever. It follows a man who risks losing his family in order to follow an ambition for space exploration and to help save the human race, but who gets caught up in the lies and machinations of his NASA colleagues and friends. There is a nice ethical strand woven in about the instinct to save yourself versus saving others.The visuals are stunning. The spaceship visits three new planets, each of which is given its own dramatic character, not to mention the wormholes and black holes. Even the cornfields back home look fabulous.So what was disappointing?Firstly the acting. Matthew McConaughey made a dull hero and I could hardly understand his drawl. The supporting cast were so-so. The best performance is a cameo from an uncredited famous Hollywood actor (I won't spoil the surprise).Secondly the duration. The film is dragged out over nearly three hours but should have been less than two.Finally, the story just became too far- fetched for me. I'm OK with SciFi plots that stretch the boundaries of scientific realism, but saving humanity through the power of love spanning space and time was a step too far for me.I enjoyed Interstellar but it didn't live up to expectations.",7,2,4,11 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than The Phantom Menace
","This is a little better than the Phantom Meanace, but it still suffers from the problems that plague the whole prequel trilogy - glossy special effects that lack heart, mediocre acting and dull set-piece battle scenes.The highlight of Attack of the Clones is seeing Yoda engage in a light-sabre fight. I took inordinate pleasure in this.In fact there's some good little sequences dotted throughout the movie. I thought the water planet inhabited by clone-farmers was interesting. And the development of Senator Palpatine's character is plain chilling.But a scene that really frustrated me is the one that should have been the making of this movie - when Anakin Skywalker murders in cold blood the community that kidnapped his mother, including the women and children. This is surely an absolutely horrific act that signals his transition towards the dark side, but no one seems too bothered - Amidala reacts by comforting him.Overall I thought this was a decent movie but it still didn't do justice to the saga.",7,0,1,19 June 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Disappointing
","A disappointment in the main. Captain America made an unconvincing superhero to me. I'm not sure if it's the scripting, the acting or the directing that's to blame - possibly all three.He is basically a scrawny American picked by the army because of his good moral nature and injected with serum to make him stronger. The serum works but he isn't exactly Superman - maybe two or three times as fast and strong as other soldiers. Fair enough you might think - until he singlehandedly frees 400 prisoners from behind enemy lines. Something doesn't add up.He's then given a shield that is quote 'stronger than steel' - not exactly revolutionary. But it then turns out this shield can withstand any blast of any kind without suffering a dent. It just feels incongruous. Is this guy just a soldier- plus or is he an indestructible superhero?The action scenes themselves mostly feel rushed. There is lots (and lots) of build- up but then when Captain America gets his powers there's an action montage that lasts only a minute or two.There is a decent ensemble cast including Tommy Lees Jones, Hugo Weaving and Samuel L Jackson. They're all OK but no more. Chris Evans who plays Captain America himself is pretty dull.It's just about watchable but overall it's a let down.",5,1,2,24 August 2015
The Godfather: Part II," Great performances from De Niro and Pacino but oh so slow
","Very similar to The Godfather - long (even longer than part 1) and oh so slow. It's just not my cup of tea at all. I don't find the story all that interesting - various criminal masterminds trying to wrestle power off each other.The only thing that makes this movie OK is the performances of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. It really is a tour de force from both of them. Al Pacino's character, Michael Corleone, is a nasty piece of work. He tries to emulate his father Vito Corleone, but he is mistrusting and has an evil streak. He's prepared to cut off, in fact kill, close family, and will not be satisfied until he gets his way. Al Pacino plays it brilliantly.Robert De Niro, playing the young Vito Corleone, makes a great contrast. More relaxed, friendly, but also prepared to commit crime and kill to forward the interests of his family. But you can't help but feel he has a warm heart.Great performances like this aren't enough to turn a 3 hour plus dull storyline into a great movie though. I still got bored.",7,1,8,13 June 2014
Predator," The perfect action movie
","I was surprised my just how much I liked this movie. It's the apotheosis of American military firepower and 'gung-ho', cleverly pitted against a single, jungle-dwelling enemy. It works brilliantly well.The movie divides into three parts, each with a distinct feel, and this keeps it interesting from beginning to end:1. A US special forces unit attacking an enemy military force. 2. The unit being picked off one by one by a mysterious 'predator' and futilely trying to defeat it with firepower. 3. Hand to hand combat between the predator and the unit's leader, 'Dutch'.Dutch is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger at the peak of his powers - he is iconic in this film. It's hard to imagine there ever being a better action hero.The film delivers on gratuitous, easy-watching violence. The are lots and lots (and lots) of munitions, deployed with gusto by the characters to noisy and visually satisfying effect.But it delivers on drama too. The soldiers are all testosterone-fuelled prats, of course, but they each have distinctive and memorable characters and are given their fair share of screen-time. There is brilliant tension worthy of a horror movie, as the true nature of the Predator is revealed bit by bit as it picks off the other characters.And the Dutch versus Predator climax is just superb.",9,4,4,17 July 2016
Oblivion," Good but could have been better
","This is definitely my type of movie - a slick, visually glorious SciFi with a nice SF plot twist thrown in.I really liked the portrayal of the abandoned Earth, the giant water- harvesting machines, and the futuristic space station outpost up in the clouds. The pairing of Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough as the space station's (and Earth's) sole guardians was spot on - you could believe they were attracted to each other but that they had such different personalities that tensions were bound to surface (as indeed they did).The early scenes on Earth in which Cruise outwits the Scavs, the supposed remnants of an alien army that humans had defeated, are excellent. As are some neat little Sci-Fi sequences such as that involving a suspended glass swimming pool in the space station.Unfortunately the movie doesn't maintain the high standard throughout. Inevitably other characters become involved as the plot develops, but somehow the characterisation isn't quite right. Morgan Freeman as the leader of the human resistance makes a dramatic entry when Cruise is captured, but is quickly sidelined into a bit part - an opportunity missed. And Olga Kurylenko is not well cast as the love interest. I didn't feel the chemistry between her and Cruise, which makes the his immediate attachment to her ahead of Riseborough seem a bit contrived.The ending is the worst part of all. A dénouement between human and alien forces beckons but is resolved very quickly by a terrible rip-off of Independence Day's ending - I'll say no more.So ultimately this was a little disappointing. But overall I did enjoy it, if only because slick SciFi movies always do it for me. Could and should have been better.",7,1,1,3 August 2014
Man of Steel," Original and exciting
","I was really (and pleasantly) surprised by just how much I enjoyed this. I'm not naturally a huge fan of modern superhero re- tellings (with notable exceptions like Nolan's batman) although I can happily watch them to wile away an evening. I was expecting this to be in the same vein.But it wasn't. It was a completely different take on the superman myth, focusing less on his heroism on Earth than on his origins in space. As a result, large portions of Man of Steel have the feel of a space epic, and a decent one at that. Fortunately, these scenes are very well-knitted with the scenes on Earth involving mankind and superman's development as a child, adolescent and man. All in all it was a breath of fresh air.The action scenes also work extremely well. The sheer power of superman and his extraterrestrial foes is brought to life as vehicles are tossed around, buildings ripped through and the ground cratered. I loved it.The only major let down was the acting. All the characters put in serviceable performances but nothing exceptional, and certainly nowhere near Dark Knight levels. As a result this isn't a top class movie, but it is very very enjoyable and original and I would recommend.",7,3,5,3 August 2014
Salt," Good spy thriller
","This question at the heart of this movie is 'whose side is Salt on?' The Americans', the Russians', or just her own? Every 15 or 20 minutes there's a new twist, so you're never quite sure what to make of her, even at the very end of the film.This movie also delivers well on the 'Hollywood thrill' of seeing a lone renegade agent out-thinking and out-fighting the entire US government (although it has to be said that's been done before, and done better, in the Bourne films).They could have improved the movie further by making Salt into a more complex character. She was very cold and calculating and always looked in control. She never seemed to face a moral dilemma or a situation she couldn't easily handle. Even the climactic double-crossing of Liev Schreiber's character didn't seem to phase her.Overall, though, I enjoyed this movie and I hope they get round to making a sequel.",7,2,3,18 March 2013
We're the Millers," Enjoyable from Start to Finish
","This is a really enjoyable movie from start to finish. There were plenty of occasions when I genuinely laughed out loud which is always a good sign.None of the acting performances were particularly special. That said, the four central characters were all very different and this worked well as it allowed the writers to create scenes focused on each of them and keep things fresh.My main criticism is that for a comedy about smuggling drugs from Mexico, very little of the movie was actually set in Mexico! I think they missed out of quite of lot of mileage in terms of generally just making the movie more interesting. Instead, most of the scenes were centred in and around RVs. Thankfully the quality of the comedy more than made up for that for the most part.",7,1,1,24 January 2014
Divergent," Better than it sounds
","This teens-fighting-teens coming of age Sci Fi is better than it sounds.It's set in a society where people are divided into factions depending on their abilities. One girl, Tris, realises she doesn't really fit into any of the factions, and with the help of a man called Four sets out to challenge those who would kill anyone who threatens the world order.It could be cheesy, but it's handled really well. Tris and her companions are set a series of physical and mental challenges, which add variety and tension to the plot. There is a strong cast, including Kate Winslet as the cold and calculating Jeanine, Ashley Judd as a caring mother, and various others, not to mention the pretty couple of Shailene Woodley and Theo James as Tris and Four.It's all set in a suitably post-Apocalyptic world, coloured by the different-hued garbs of the factions. A good movie.",7,0,0,2 January 2017
Ender's Game," Just average
","I do like Sci-Fi movies that test the boundaries of our morality by imagining extreme future scenarios. Ender's Game is certainly one of those - it imagines a world when we deliberately turn children into soldiers to fight an enemy which threatens our very existence. Unfortunately, it treats this grave subject with kid gloves.The children who are sent to fight the alien Formics are treated to a series of war 'games', simulations that progressively get more and more complex. The problem is that these games are always one step removed from the actual enemy.So all we really see is a group of school kids with all their usual petty disagreements, who just happen to play video games. It never really feels like training child soldiers is a particularly unusual or worrisome endeavour.The movie is somewhat rescued by the excellent Asa Butterfield, who plays Ender, the child commander of Earth's forces. He is a genuinely complex and interesting character, and Butterfield is the only actor in this movie of real talent (even Harrison Ford was mediocre in comparison).I did enjoy watching Ender's Game but I am struggling to rate it as any more than just average.",6,4,6,17 November 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Excellent, dark mystery
","This movie is fantastic from start to finish. It's full of fascinating and very well-played characters. It's dark (really dark), it's moody, it grabs your attention and never lets you go. The pace of plot development is spot on.I thought both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara were excellent (Mara that little bit more excellent than Craig!). They also weave in a really subtle love story.I find it hard to think of much to criticise, but being a mystery story it probably needed a few more plot twists and a few more interesting minor characters to justify a 10 out of 10!",9,2,7,21 June 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Decent but not one of the best MI movies
","This is another decent addition to the Mission Impossible series but it wasn't one of the best. It's missing the two most important ingredients:1. Interesting characters, especially bad guys (think Vanessa Redgrave in MI or Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3). I hate to say it but Tom Cruise is easily the best actor in Rogue Nation.2. Thrilling set-pieces (the break-in scene from MI, or the skyscraper scene from Ghost Protocol). Rogue Nation's underwater security hack just didn't quite cut it for me.Aside from that, it is a perfectly good spy/action flick. The fights are good. Ethan Hunt and Lane (the bad guy) keep outwitting each other in a pretty decent plot.But it didn't grip me like some of the other MI movies have.",6,9,15,26 December 2015
Aliens," Really good Sci-Fi action movie
","I watched this shortly after watching Alien. I was surprised by how different it was. Whereas Alien is a dramatic, suspenseful horror, Aliens is an all-out gung-ho action thriller.Overall I preferred Alien, but Aliens does have a lot going for it. Sigourney Weaver is just as good as she was in the first movie - a believable gutsy action heroine with a soul. There is the sense of a relentless war of attrition, as the squad of marines steadily gets whittled down. And the non-stop action is thrilling - in fact it gets better and better as the movie goes on, culminating in an incredible battle between Weaver and the alien queen that is extremely well directed.Saying all that, there are enough all-out action movies in the world and while this is one of the better ones, it is not as unique and original as Alien was. I also didn't think the aliens themselves were as frightening in this. They seem to get blasted away in large numbers with relative ease (bar the queen), like it's an exercise in pest control rather a battle with superhuman monsters.But anyhow, this is an enjoyable and thrilling action movie that overall I would recommend.",7,0,1,16 September 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A good addition to the X-men franchise
","A good addition to the X-men franchise. What makes it original is the strong contrast between the future scenes featuring a final band of X-men standing up to the power-absorbing Sentinels, and the scenes from the past featuring a young Xavier and Magneto.The future scenes feature some impressive special effects and earthquakingly powerful mutant-on-Sentinel battles. The opening sequence in particular is a cracker.The scenes set in the past are interesting for their insights into the early years of Xavier and Magneto but don't have the same oomph. James McAvoy is a little too fragile as the young Xavier - he's not a persuasive match for Patrick Stewart and seems to be easily outclassed by the young Magneto.The climax of the movie is a tad pedestrian, but taken as a whole this is worth a watch.",7,1,1,2 January 2017
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Another excellent instalment
","Another really excellent instalment from the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit franchise. They've got the formula right and they just keep on churning out movies that I love.The Desolation of Smaug has a number of sequences that really stand out. The capture of the dwarfs by the wood elves and their subsequent escape in barrels down the river is glorious - a relatively minor event in the book but here a long sequence packed full of quirky action scenes and fast-paced special effect fun.The other excellent sequence is the scenes in Smaug's lair. The dragon is brought to life brilliantly and the cave full of treasure is absolutely immense. It all makes for great viewing.The performances from the likes of Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen and Richard Armitage were spot on. I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Desolation of Smaug.",8,1,2,13 June 2014
Bridesmaids," Not that funny
","I may well be in the minority here but I thought this movie was mediocre. It's full of crude toilet humour which is sometimes funny but often not. The love story is so-so and basically just forms a bit of background noise for the jokes.It also paints female friendships in a horribly stereotypical light, i.e., women are bitchy but will ultimately stand up for each other and have a hug.The main merit of the movie is it's fast pace and the fact it keeps itself ticking along with a few gags. It was an easy watch and I guess if you've got the right sense of humour you'll enjoy it.",5,1,2,7 March 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Excellent addition to the franchise
","More great stuff from this franchise. They really do an excellent job of recreating the world of Middle Earth to spectacular effect and (nine times out of ten) just as you'd imagined it from the books.But before I wax lyrical about The Hobbit, let me mention a couple of things that I *don't* like. Firstly, I was really disappointed with the job they did with the dwarfs. Most of them simply don't look like dwarfs! They just look like shrunk humans. Some of them - Thorin in particular - look tall and slim. How annoying! Secondly, I thought they lost a bit of the humour that I remember from reading The Hobbit. The scene where the dwarfs arrive at Bilbo's house and the episode with the trolls were laugh-out-loud funny in the book; not here.Aside from those points, however, this movie is excellent. It moves along at a quick pace. Martin Freeman is simply superb as Bilbo Baggins (much better than Elijah Wood was as Frodo). The landscape and special effects are just as phenomenal as in Lord of the Rings. The scene with Gollum rivals the best scenes of the whole franchise.One final point. There's numerous instances where they've added to the story that was in the book, in fact they've even introduced some completely new characters. Some people won't like this but personally I think it helps with the transition from page to screen and I didn't mind at all.",8,1,4,6 January 2014
The Incredibles," Good family movie
","This is a good family movie. It watched it with my wife, five year old and seven year old and we all enjoyed it (although the five year old got a bit scared by the 'good guy' getting captured). It's hard to find movies that we all get something out of so that is a win.There's a good mix of action, peril, humour and character. The plot (superheroes struggling to accept normal life) isn't all that original but it does the job.One thing that surprised me is that there are a lot of people that get blown up, crushed, sucked into plane turbines etc. Nothing particularly gruesome is shown but I was surprised at the sheer numbers of deaths shown in a movie aimed at families.I'd definitely recommend it as a family viewing.",7,0,0,1 January 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Dull
",A big disappointment for me compared to the other Bourne movies.Jeremy Renner is no replacement for Matt Damon but this isn't even the main problem with the movie.The problem is the plot. It's dull dull dull. It basically follows Renner's character as he tries to dodge the authorities (which he is able to do with ease - boring) and find some performance-enhancing drugs (yes really).There are a handful of half-decent action scenes but nothing special. Rachel Weisz was OK as Renner's co-star but they didn't give her much to do other than be a helpless female in need of his protection.Don't rush to see this.,4,0,2,6 August 2015
Ex Machina," Really good
","This is the sort of movie I love. A thoughtful SciFi that asks the moral questions about where science is taking us, is great to watch, and delivers a brilliant twist in the tale.Alicia Vikander steals the show with her portrayal of the android at the heart of the movie. She delivers just the right balance of meekness, coldness, magnetism and ruthlessness. She's ably supported by Domhnall Gleeson who plays the computer geek that falls for her.The pace of the movie is slow but that's OK. It's set in a purpose built villa in the middle of an isolated forest. This create an intense atmosphere, focusing on a handful of characters in close quarters over the course of a few days, and the changing relationships between them.It's really good.",8,2,5,6 August 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Really excellent Swedish thriller
","Overall I prefer the English language version of this film directed by David Fincher, but this original Swedish version is excellent too.Michael Nyqvist is very well cast as Mikael Blomkvist, the disgraced journalist trying to solve an obscure murder mystery. Noomi Rapace, meanwhile, is pretty good as the tattooed, socially inept but highly intelligent Lisbeth Salander - good, but nowhere near as good as Rooney Mara in the Fincher version.The atmosphere created on the remote Swedish island is superb. It's the perfect setting for a murder mystery. There's a great contrast made between the aristocratic mansion of Henrik Vanger, the modern home of Martin Vanger, and the ramshackle cottage used by Blomkvist.The story is the excellent plot from the book, and this film gives full rein to it, including the explicit sexual violence, the painstaking detective work, and the unusual relationship between Blomkvist and Salander.It's a really good movie.",8,1,1,9 January 2016
The Imitation Game," Best Bletchley Park movie yet
","The Imitation Game is the best attempt yet to tell the story of the WWII code breakers at Bletchley Park but it's not perfect.Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role of Alan Turing, the antisocial but brilliant professor. The story of how he approached the methodical task of code breaking by building a machine (a computer?) from scratch is well-told in this movie, with all the accompanying frustrations, half-successes and eventual euphoria.But elsewhere there are weaknesses. The Imitation Game tries to be a much broader biography of Turing and for instance document the impact his homosexuality had on his life. But while the flashbacks to his boyhood work well, there are virtually no scenes showing the adult Turing's relationship with other men. Instead, the focus is on his relationship with a woman, Joan Clarke, played by Keira Knightley. She is misplaced in this movie. The relationship isn't a very interesting one and there is no chemistry (perhaps deliberately so). Surely there were men in Turing's life that we should have heard more about?The Imitation Game could also have better illustrated the terrible consequences of the actions of the men at Bletchley. There is a fascinating moral tale told here - that in order not to let the Germans find out their code had been broken, the British deliberately failed to act on some of the intelligence received. This made them complicit in the deaths of their own civilians (for 'the greater good') and yet all we see of the consequences of this is a quick clip of a smoking transporter ship. It could have been much grittier.I did enjoy watching The Imitation Game and I still think the Bletchley Park story is quite incredible, but this movie didn't hit all the high notes I'd hoped it would.",7,0,0,17 November 2015
The Piano," Soppy romance.... and yet brilliant!
","I was a bit unsure whether I'd enjoy this movie when my wife rented it out. It sounded a bit too romance-soppy for my tastes. But I have to admit it confounded my expectations. I think the setting, deep in rural New Zealand at the time of the colonists, was so original that it brought something completely new to the familiar love triangle story line.And of course, of course of course, what a wonderful performance by Holly Hunter. It was a stroke of genius to make the lead actress dumb. It makes you concentrate on all the other parts of her performance. Her movement, her expressions, her decisions. And the piano as an emblem works well. The supporting performances from Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill and Anna Paquin are excellent too.I can't say this movie is perfect. It does, as I predicted, have that soppy storyline after all. But it's incredibly well done, very refreshing and certainly worthy of those Oscars.",8,2,5,3 January 2014
Jurassic World," Basically a remake of Jurassic Park; but a good one!
","This is basically a remake of the original Jurassic Park movie. It follows the same concept of kids, staying with their relatives, trapped in a theme park with dinosaurs on the loose. It just does it with more dinosaurs than before (adding swimming and flying dinosaurs to the mix) and bigger dinosaurs than before (a genetically-enhanced killer).It even plays tongue-in-cheek homage to that original movie by reusing a number of visual cues (DNA man, the jeeps, flare to attract the T-Rex). And the mix of characters is basically the same too - corporate greed types, scientists that overreach themselves, the guy who 'understands' dinosaurs, the well-meaning but naive owner.So how did it stack up?Well it is clearly not as good (not as new, not as involving, not even as tense) as the original Jurassic Park. But it surprised me how much I did enjoy Jurassic World. By sticking to the original formula they were using some thing that worked - and it had me hooked from start to finish. There's a good tension and threat level throughout. The scary dinosaur scenes just keep on coming, from velociraptor chases, to pterosaur flocks, to dinosaur-on- dinosaur fights. And people just keep on getting eaten, one after another!Others have said that the heavy use of CGI was a problem. I disagree. I found all the dinosaurs to be incredibly lifelike.The acting is (while not poor) not going to win any Oscars. It was a relatively unknown cast and could have benefited from a couple of top actors to bring more gravitas.But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's great fun and I would watch it again.",8,19,38,29 December 2015
Prisoners," Unsettling but brilliant
","A deeply unsettling but brilliantly directed film. It's billed as a crime movie, but feels more like a horror movie!Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal put in superb performances as respectively one of the parents and the investigating officer of two children that have gone missing. It is clear that they don't trust each other even though they are on the same 'side' and it's the tension between these two characters that makes this movie spark.The horror comes from Hugh Jackman's character resorting to imprisoning and torturing a suspect who he is convinced took his child, subjecting him to probably even worse treatment than the missing children have experienced. The other parents find out what is going on, but choose to turn a blind eye. As I said, it's deeply unsettling.Towards the end the movie turns into a face-paced edge of the seat thriller, as the facts of the cases are revealed in quick succession and both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's characters race to find and rescue the children. The tension reaches fever pitch as the horrific truth of what has happened comes to light.",8,1,2,24 February 2014
Limitless," So-so movie with best 'twist' ever
","This movie has a typical thriller plot - man tries to solve mystery and gets chased by bad guys while doing so. This helps to keep up a steady level of excitement and interest.As thrillers go, however, it's not much to shout about. Bradley Cooper is OK as the unmotivated-wannabe-turned-slick-operator. But the basic idea - that you take a drug to try and become more successful - isn't terribly original.Most of the movie in any case is just taken up by Cooper or his girlfriend running away from things. One of the bad guys, 'The Man in the Tan Coat' is almost comically robotic in the chase scenes which doesn't help. They could and should have made much more of the big- pharma conspiracy subplot.The ending however, is absolutely inspired. Just when you think the movie is heading towards a moralistic 'drugs can't make you successful' denouement, Cooper gets away with everything scot-free! He gets the girl and the career and supposedly eliminates the side-effects of the drug. It's brilliantly clever compared to the typical double or triple twists you get in most movies nowadays. The new Hollywood twist is there is no twist!",6,0,0,16 March 2013
Shine," Saddening and uplifting at the same time
","This is a mostly uplifting biopic of David Helfgott, an Australian pianist afflicted by mental disease. Uplifting because although his illness ultimately stops him realising his full potential, he does survive it and emerges from his darkest moments to get back into the concert hall again. In other words, this is a celebration of survival.The strongest aspect of the movie is the relationship between Helfgott and his father, a Polish Jewish immigrant to Australia. The father is presented as a harsh taskmaster, extremely proud but also wanting what (he believes) is the best for his family. His domineering approach drives the two of them apart and (you suspect) contributes to Helfgott's illness. But the interactions between Armin Mueller-Stahl as the father and Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush as Helfgott at different ages provide the strongest moments of drama.There are a number of Helfgott's other relationships explored - his friendship with an elderly woman and music-lover, his apprenticeship with a professor in London, and his falling in love with a woman who becomes his wife. But none of these sustains the same level of drama and interest as the father-son scenes.Of course a mention also has to be given to the music. There's plenty of beautiful piano playing (I'd have liked more), culminating in a frantic performance of Rachmaninoff's 3rd piano concerto in the movie's signature and pivotal scene. I'd watch Shine again just to see this clip.",8,1,1,16 November 2014
Inside Man," Doesn't live up to its promise
","The concept is good - it's a daring bank robbery with an original twist. And the cast is packed full of big name performers. But somehow this movie didn't deliver on its promise for me.After the initial break-in and hostage-taking by Clive Owen as Dalton Russell and his band of well-drilled co-conspirators, the plot kind of grinds to a halt and starts heading down all sort of random cul-de-sacs. I think the point is to keep you guessing as to the motives of the robbers and how they will escape - but to me it just felt fragmented and sapped the tension out of the movie. The worst of these subplots involves Jodie Foster acting as Madelaine White, an unconvincing go-between on behalf of the bank's owner who wants to recover some incriminating documents from his own safety deposit box. When White finally gets into the bank building, she simply has a short dialogue with Russell and heads straight out again. Thrilling stuff - not.I'd have preferred Inside Man to be a straight up cop vs bad guy battle of wits between Denzel Washington's character Detective Frazier and Dalton Russell. This is the main thrust of the plot in any case and where the movie is at its strongest, for example Russell outwitting Frazier by playing a tape in Armenian to make him think the robbers were from the Caucasus, or the excellent 'flash forward' scenes where Frazier interviews the 'hostages' to try and find out which of them were accomplices to Russell.All in all this movie has enough going for it to make it enjoyable viewing. But not a favourite of mine.",6,1,3,3 August 2014
Jack Reacher," Disappointing
","This was disappointing. Tom Cruise plays an ex-army investigator who gets embroiled in a conspiracy surrounding the apparently random shooting of five people.Tom Cruise plays his part just fine. But the other characters are below par. Rosamund Pike is dull as the attorney that Cruise ends up working with. The man under suspicion of murder spends 90% of the film in a coma. And the most promising character, The Zec, the leader of the conspirators, barely gets a chance to make a mark, barring a gruesome scene dispatching of an errant foot soldier under a bridge.The plot twist becomes obvious early so it's not really a detective movie. Instead it steadily turns into a straightforward action hero flick, culminating in a gun/hand to hand combat climax.It was just about watchable but it wasn't great.",5,0,1,30 March 2015
Thor," It was OK
","Thor was OK. It was basically a hugely Americanised modernisation of Norse mythology, with the gods turned into superheroes. What I did like was the way the gods were presented in their home of Asgard. It was a mix of industry, magic and Sci-Fi that seemed to fit the Norse characters well. I also liked the character of Loki, who was positioned quite rightly as the trickster, neither good guy or bad guy who looks out for himself and no one else.Then there's the perfectly good superhero-type fight scenes. Thor throwing his hammer around, beating up monsters 50 times his size, creating hurricanes, etc. All good.So shame all of that was secondary to the 'humanised' story of Thor as a man literally brought down to Earth, stripped of his powers because of his arrogance, and sent off to find his humility. All very Americanised and a story that could be told about virtually any character. Not what I was ideally looking to get from a movie about Norse gods.",6,0,3,21 May 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Terrible
","Very disappointing. I was expecting some kind of serious, high- octane financial drama.Instead, all I got was a boring series of over-the-top wild New York parties punctuated by terrible toilet humour and woeful acting.Well, woeful apart from Leonardo DiCaprio. He put in a good turn as always and saved this movie from total disaster. DiCaprio was entirely believable as the suave con-artist, Jordan Belfort.But otherwise this movie was terrible - dull and oh so long. There's no plot to speak of, unless you call continuous trite speeches, adolescent humour, and sordid parties a plot. Not for me, sorry.",4,1,4,26 October 2014
The Reader," Compelling and heartrending
","I found this movie utterly compelling. We stumbled across it when channel flicking and were immediately hooked.At the heart of the movie is a moral dilemma faced by a law student, an impossible choice over a small intervention that could have major consequences on the life of the woman he loves. It's rather contrived, but the superb performances of Kate Winslet and Bruno Ganz make it completely believable. Ralph Fiennes is OK as the older Michael but this is Ganz and Winslet's movie really.Even as the denouement approaches, the plot rightly allows no room for easy resolution or absolution of the moral issues. It's heart- rending viewing but excellent.",8,1,1,29 October 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Epic battles in Middle Earth
","I thought I might be a little bored of the franchise but no - this is yet another excellent and enjoyable Tolkein adaptation. Sadly it's likely to be the last.Barring a slightly rushed start (surely the dragon could have been allotted a bit more air time?), this movie develops well into an epic clash of warring armies, setting the scene nicely for the battles for Middle Earth that come in the Lord of the Rings.The battles are extremely well done, from the large-scale army engagements, to an enthralling individual fight between Thorin and the Orc leader. (The Orcs by the way are surely one of the most expertly-crafted monsters in movie history.)There is also a nice little dramatic scene midway through featuring Saruman, Elrond and Galadriel.Superb stuff.",8,4,7,19 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the 'Prequels' by far
","This is easily the best of the prequel movies. In fact, it's an excellent movie, it which the strands of the previous movies come together brilliantly to set the scene for events in the original trilogy.It does still suffer from the problems that plague the whole prequel trilogy - glossy special effects that lack heart, mediocre acting and boring set-piece battle scenes. But this is more than made up for by a series of glorious encounters between the central characters.Senator Palpatine's plot to turn Anakin Skywalker into his apprentice is handled deftly through a series of interactions between them. There are gloriously satisfying light-sabre battles between virtually everyone. And a moving denouement as Amidala dies giving birth to the Skywalker twins and Anakin is left a crippled and deformed husk, rescued and encased in a suit to become Darth Vader. Every plot line you'd hoped for is in here.Given the underwhelming quality of most the prequel trilogy, this is a creditable effort deserving of praise.",8,2,2,19 June 2016
The Lion King," Even better than 'Frozen'
","My favourite Disney movie of all time. I watched this again recently with my young children and I was just as gripped as when I watched it as a child myself.I found myself singing the songs with my daughter afterwards.The animation is truly wonderful. Although this film is 20 years old I'm not sure they could have made it any more impressive today. The full majesty of Africa, the terror and exhilaration of the wildebeest stampede, the colours and the sounds - it's exhilarating.The story is a fairly typical Disney one of a kid who loses his way before remembering what it means to have responsibility. But that's fine by me.This is a movie to make you feel good and re-live a child-like sense of awe and wonder.",9,2,2,5 November 2015
Inception," Visually rich, superb Sci-Fi
","I was looking forward to watching this after all I'd heard about it, and I wasn't disappointed. The plot line is nice and complex like any good sci fi movie, and that isn't even the best part. The cinematography and screenplay is superb - it's a visually rich and arresting spectacle with dream-scape after dream-scape revealing new aspects of the characters' psyches. And, it has to be said, Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead brilliantly. He's reserved, ambitious, tortured - a really interesting character.All in all there's not much wrong with this movie, but I do want to level a couple of small criticisms. I thought the dream within a dream within a dream concept was taken a teeny bit too far - just a teeny bit, but I did feel they could have come up with some more interesting ideas near the end other than just going into yet another dream level. And I also thought that the supporting cast were weak compared to DiCaprio. For those reasons I've shaved my rating down to an 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,3 January 2014
Defiance," Good war drama
","Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber are well cast in this war drama/thriller. They are very believable as eastern European tough guy brothers with a softer side.It is the story of the relationship between these brothers (there's also a third brother) that makes this movie work. It's set in the context of a dramatic but ultimately uplifting story of a group of Jews who hide out in the forests to avoid persecution during World War II.I was unsure quite how realistic the movie was. It is based on a true story but it is hard to believe so many people could build extensive structures in the forests without being discovered and get anywhere near enough food to eat, never mind going head to head with tanks in a firefight. It felt a little too good to be true. But it's hard to judge - it says it's a true story and who am I to argue.All in all this is a good war drama that sheds light on a story few of us will have heard of before.",7,1,2,3 November 2014
Sherlock Holmes," Unexpected. Disappointing.
","Exactly how a Sherlock Holmes movie shouldn't be done! This wasn't a drama of deductive reasoning. It was a period light action movie. Think Shanghai Knights (except not as good).The one thing that can be said for it is that it's pacey. There must have been five- plus decent prolonged action scenes.But this isn't what I put a movie called Sherlock Holmes in to my DVD player to see!The detective work is mostly limited to Holmes predicting the direction of his opponents next punches. Robert Downey Jr, who plays Holmes, is totally opposite to the character I expected (although I suspect this is partly the point).In the end this movie wiled away an evening fairly innocuously but I'm not going to rush to see the sequel.",5,0,0,11 April 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," Performance of a Lifetime from Tim Robbins
","This isn't the type of movie that I would normally rave about. It's about the triumph of hope over despair, and friendship over division - it's a feel good movie.But the truth is I think The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely fantastic. When I try to put my finger on why I like this more than other feel good movies, I think it's largely because of the wonderful collision of brilliant characterisation and top-class performing that is Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins.The character of Andy - humble but steely, quiet but intelligent, simple but cunning - is just perfect for this movie. He's so different to almost any other prison break character you can imagine, and extremely engaging. And Tim Robbins is the perfect casting - he puts in the performance of a lifetime.Tim is very well supporting by Morgan Freeman as Red, and in fact the entire supporting cast does their job.The plot is interesting - it consists of a series of successes and falls for Andy. He keeps on picking himself and dusting himself down. You end up assuming that it's all going to end tragically, which I suppose why his final, spectacular triumph is so uplifting. Yes, it's unrealistic, but it certainly won me over!",9,1,1,8 July 2014
Prometheus," Enjoyable viewing
","A perfectly good SciFi horror. Not to the same spine-tingling standards or as gritty as the original Alien movie, but certainly in the same vein.The movie follows the tired SciFi cliché of a spaceship full of clashing egos, but I wasn't complaining - it's a format that is proved to work. Sadly, the large cast does mean that there's too little time given to character development but again that's only to be expected.The heroine Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace, is a fairly strong character but not to Sigourney Weaver standards. She is overshadowed by Michael Fassbender as the quixotic android who rather steals the show. Charlize Theron plays a vile company rep but oddly fails to feature as much as you'd expect (I suspect this is a deliberate red herring to make you think she might end up being the sole survivor rather than Rapace). All in all, it's an interesting cast if short of any truly exceptional performances.Initially I was disappointed that the Alien creatures didn't feature more but actually that doesn't prove to be a problem. There are various references to them that build up the franchise's mythology in a clever way, from the eggs and nesting sites to a foetus that gets implanted in Shaw's womb (probably the finest scene in the movie).The pace throughout is good and the destructive finale is a nice echo of the original Alien, with Shaw's survivor instinct on impressive display. A good night's viewing.",7,1,1,3 August 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A let down
","I really liked the first two movies of this trilogy and so I was thrilled to bits at the opportunity to watch Dark Knight Rises when it appeared on my TV screen.But oh! How I was disappointed! This is one of the most frustrating let downs of a movie I've seen in a long time.Batman, far from street-fighting criminals from the off, spends long chunks of the movie first moping about his manor, then getting holed up in an underground prison. I think these episodes are supposed to show some kind of character development but they are just insufferably dull.Then there are the half-hearted introductions of Catwoman (half- hearted because they seem too embarrassed to allow this character to fully develop and end up portraying Anne Hathaway as a kind of confused burglar that dresses in black) and Robin.Thank goodness there's a decent bad guy or this movie would be an unmitigated disaster. Tom Hardy as Bane is a tour de force, a twisted, exaggerated, mad villain in the best traditions of all batman reproductions. He is so good that in the end it seems laughable that batman finally defeats him.Not great although just about watchable because of Bane. A let down.",5,5,8,3 August 2014
The Croods," The most colourful movie ever!
","What a delightful family movie! We chose this not quite knowing what to expect and my goodness we were in for a treat.The story itself is pretty straightforward - a stone age family loses their home and has to search for a new one, and in the process learn about the really important things in life. Nothing too surprising there then.But it's the way this story is told that makes it fantastic. This is an incredibly fun and spectacularly colourful movie.The animation is done with blistering speed and real panache. There is a scene near the start showing the family out foraging for an egg - a simple enough idea but the resulting stand-off and chase with other hunting animals is a thrilling tour-de- force of animation.And my goodness, the colours! Every landscape and virtually every creature is lush with all the colours of the rainbow and (so it feels) more.This truly fits the definition of a 'magical' family movie. We were entranced.",8,1,2,26 December 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson at the top of their game
","A rather curious idea for a movie. This is all about the making of the Mary Poppins film, and more particularly the love-hate relationship between Walt Disney and PL Travers (the author of Mary Poppins).Disney and Travers are played by Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, and thank goodness they got hold of such great actors because the best scenes are where these two are interacting.It's a classic personality clash between Disney the populist entertainer and Travers the stuck-up British 'serious author'. But of course the point of the film is that really they are very alike - they both want to make the world a better place.It's an entertaining journey. Walt Disney is supported by a crew of three men who are the main creative force behind the Mary Poppins film. They provide some fascinating insights into how the songs were created. And yes I found myself singing along.Finally, there's the subplot. Travers has repeated flashbacks to her childhood and memories of her drunkard (but well-meaning) father. I found this sat oddly with the rest of the movie (and even bored me) although I understand the point they were trying to make about how Travers became the way she is.",7,1,1,2 January 2016
Beowulf," Decent Fantasy Epic
","At first I didn't like this movie at all. I thought the animation was a dreadful idea. What is the point in animating perfectly good actors and actresses when special effects nowadays allow you to have great visuals but still have people looking like real people?But eventually I got used to the style and it stopped bothering me. Just as well because it meant I could enjoy what is actually a rather decent epic adventure story.I studied the poem Beowulf at university and I'm familiar with the story, so I noticed where the movie deviated significantly from the plot.However, I actually preferred the plot of the movie, because it brings an additional tragic element into the tale and makes Beowulf seem that bit more human. I honestly don't think the Anglo-Saxons would have minded. In fact, I think they would have relished the relentless focus on action, heroic deeds, mead halls and wenches that fills the movie from start to finish.It's not an exceptional movie by any stretch of the imagination but a decent fantasy epic all the same.",6,0,1,22 August 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Less Thor, more Loki please!
","I preferred this to the first Thor movie. It is predominantly set in the lands of the gods rather than on Earth -which means more scope for SciFi/magical cityscapes, weird spaceships and bad guys.Thor himself, played by Chris Hemsworth, is actually a bit dull. In the first movie he goes through a character development from an insolent young adult to a responsible king-in- waiting. In The Dark World he's just regal, sensible and boring.But don't dismay! The character of Loki is developed very nicely in this movie and he steals the show. Loki is the double- crossing trickster of the gods and much more interesting than the one-dimensional characters surrounding him. Tom Hiddleston is well-cast in this role.The bad guys, the Dark Elves, are excellent too. They're truly frightening creatures (for a 12-rated film). Full marks to the make-up artists I think. There's some great battle scenes between the Dark Elves and the Asgardians.All in all this isn't a masterpiece but it's entertaining viewing throughout.(And it's surely just a matter of time before a Loki spin-off movie comes our way!)",7,0,1,5 November 2015
Lucy," Very shabby
","This is very poor and quite bizarre. Propped up by the talents of Scarlet Johansson and Morgan Freeman, there is little going for this movie barring their acting talents.The concept piques one's curiosity to start with - an innocent girl caught in a dark deal starts to gain powers after massively overdosing on a new drug. But the idea is developed in the worst possible way - as a pointless expansion of her powers to superhuman with no real moral quandaries to worry about, backed up by the most ludicrous pseudoscience.I pity Freeman, tasked with playing the intellectual behind the absurd concept that by unlocking the untapped potential of the human brain, incredible powers over other people and inanimate objects can be unlocked.This concept gradually replaces any semblance of a plot line until I found myself counting down the minutes to the movie's end. Very shabby.",3,2,7,2 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Who cares if it's not original? It's brilliant!
","A perfect coming together of plot, great characters, well-placed humour, lovingly created settings and, of course, a big dose of nostalgia.This is the PERFECT adventure movie.The only thing stopping me giving this a 10/10 is its lack of originality. Whether you view this as delightful homage to the original Star Wars trilogy or boring rehash, there's no denying that The Force Awakens is not breaking new ground.But that didn't bother me too much.Because what The Force Awakens does do (and do brilliantly) is seamlessly bring together the finest elements of the previous movies (and indeed other SciFi adventures) into something quite special.1. The plot. It's a tale of good versus evil, the little guy against the universe, but it also brings through some important threads from the earlier movies and isn't afraid of bold plot twists (no spoilers here).2. The new characters. Kylo Ren is the worthy successor to Darth Vader - not as iconic (yet) but he comes with a chilling human kind of evil. Then there's Rey, the hero (a female lead - good decision), played by Daisy Ridley who puts in an excellent performance, like an action hero version of Keira Knightley. And BB-8 as the droid sidekick is just as likable as R2-D2. There are others but these were the standouts.3. The humour. It's not laugh-out-loud funny but there's a healthy scattering of (well-judged) punchlines. Star Wars never took itself too seriously and The Force Awakens gets this spot on.4. The lovingly created settings. The original movies were notable for creating a fully populated universe of bizarre aliens and intriguing landscapes that weren't CGI-shiny but felt 'real'. The CGI-heavy prequels lost this feeling altogether. The Force Awakens tries to take the best of both - CGI when it will enhance the special effects and costume and models when it'll feel gritty. It does a good job (although the original trilogy still has the edge in this respect).And finally 5. The nostalgia. Here The Force Awakens is quite rightly shameless in using every possible opportunity to bring back characters, droids, spaceships and even lines of script that we'll recognise from the previous movies. It gives a lovely nostalgic continuity without (in my opinion) taking the limelight from the new characters (... OK, so Han Solo steals some limelight!).The perfect adventure movie?My answer is a resounding Yes!",9,3,18,22 December 2015
RED," Not great
","I'll be honest - I didn't think much of this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted action flick full of special effects and cheesy one-liners that would be easy but enjoyable viewing. With an all-star cast, what could possibly go wrong?The answer is that the all-star cast was probably the undoing of this movie. None of Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman looked at home - the movie was too small, too simple, the characters too basic to give them room to put on good performances. In the end, it comes across as though their hearts aren't in it.Worst of all is the totally unbelievable love interest side-plot between Bruce Willis and Sarah Ross. Totally cringe-worthy and it didn't work.And as for the special effects and cheesy one-liners? There's a few, but nothing to get excited about. Overall it's a disappointment.",5,1,3,13 June 2014
The Truman Show," Good but should have been better
","The concept of someone's entire life being turned into reality television seems remarkably prescient given the boom in reality TV that has happened since. The plot line of this movie, which follows Jim Carrey's attempts to a) understand some of the oddities about his world, and b) escape from it altogether, could never really fail, and it doesn't disappoint. It's a really enjoyable watch.I can't help feeling, however, that in the hands of a better director, and (as much as I love Jim Carrey) with a different lead actor, this movie could have been even better. It has all the markings of a SciFi dystopian classic, but never realises its potential, preferring to remain primarily a quirky American comedy drama.",7,0,0,12 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Poor Teenage Fantasy
",Not great. This feels like a shiny version of a cult offering and it's not a cult I have any interest in. It's full of characters befitting a teenage fantasy novel and indeed there's not much guessing needed as to the target audience.The concept of a SciFi world in which kids are forced to fight each other to the death is a terrifying one and needs to treated either as a gruesome horror or a satire with tongue firmly in cheek. Having pretty teenagers slickly and bloodlessly dispatching each other is not the way to do it.Poor.,4,4,8,25 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Just a joy to watch
","Star Wars is a glorious swashbuckling tale, filled with memorable (and now iconic) characters and told at a ripping pace.It's such a joy to watch.Even now, the special effects hold up remarkably well. The X Wing / Tie-Fighter battles in particular are marvellous. The light sabres are brilliant (although the sabre fights themselves seem a tad lacklustre now).But the best thing about Star Wars is the sheer love and care lavished on the fictional galaxy created for the film. It's a rich and varied place. The attention to detail is unequalled. There are weird and wonderful aliens at every turn. The cast is delightfully wide- ranging - Jedi, mercenaries, monsters, robots, soldiers and of course the star of the show, Darth Vader, all feature prominently. And the plot - simple enough (good guy versus bad guy), but fast- paced and varied. None of the scenes outstay their welcome, but make way for another equally as good.It's simply an expertly delivered ripping yarn",9,0,0,19 June 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Gory and Witty
","A witty spy movie that is highly watchable.Colin Firth and Taron Egerton are excellent co-stars, playing private agents pitted against a mad environmentalist played by Samuel L Jackson.The plot ticks along nicely. It is very light-hearted in feel and full of witty one-liners.They play on this lightness cleverly by interspersing the movie with scenes of horrific gore and violence. It's an unnerving mix but they make it work. Colin Firth's massacre of a church congregation in particular is hard to forget.Overall a good bit of escapist, gory, witty fun.",7,2,7,6 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Amazing
","Wow. What an epic.This is a glorious SciFi Adventure Fantasy.Like with the first Star Wars movie, the Empire Strikes Back presents a rich and varied universe peopled with countless strange creatures. The Ice World of Hoth is a fantastic setting for the opening scenes. But whereas many other movies would have settled for that, here Hoth is abandoned within a few minutes in favour of other, equally wonderful climes. There's Dagobah, an isolated swamp world, and a Cloud City. Not to mention all the spaceships.This is also the movie where we're introduced to the main characters' mentors - Yoda, surely the finest creation of the whole saga, who teaches Luke the arts of the Jedi. But also the Emperor, the true evil behind Darth Vader.Overall The Empire Strikes Back is just as good as the first Star Wars movie. It builds on the original plot brilliantly, adding complexity as we discover the relationships between the characters.It also matches the fight scenes. There might not be an equivalent to the first movie's X-Wing/Tie-Fighter aerial fights, but on the other hand the light sabre duels are a bit more convincing than first time round. There's also a cracking set piece battle early on featuring some impressive machines including the iconic Imperial Walkers.The Empire Strikes Back is nearly a perfect movie. My only small gripe was the scenes on the Cloud City - there's an extended bit where nothing much happens as Vader and co go about capturing the rebels. When you get used to the brilliant pace and excitement of the rest of the movie, this is noticeable.",9,1,2,19 June 2016
Minions," Likable
","I watched Minions with my young children and we were all won over by the cast of funny, likable yellow creatures.The movie has a good pace to it. It starts out with a nicely crafted montage sequence explaining the origin of the minions and tracing their eternal search for a 'boss' throughout history.It then follows three of the minions as they leave their hideout in deepest Siberia and travel to America and then England to find their latest baddie boss, a female mastermind called Scarlet Overkill. Sadly, Overkill turns out to be pretty uninteresting and clichéd character.Not to worry though - we never tired of the minions themselves.The comedy is mostly slapstick with a few jokes thrown in for the adults. It's rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but it's pleasantly amusing. The scenes set in London make use of good- humoured caricatures of England, including a few cameos from the queen herself.If you like the characters of the minions (and who doesn't?) you can't really go wrong with this movie.",7,1,1,9 December 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Takes itself too seriously
","A decent movie from the Transformers franchise.Dark of the Moon has a fairly dark plot, involving the seeming total invasion and enslavement of Earth, and the apparent exile of the Autobots. There is also an 'ememy from within' subplot that's delivered well.What I dislike about these Transformer movies is that they take themselves too seriously. The transformers are portrayed as serious defenders of humanity. The fact that they are cars that turn into robots makes this seem a bit absurd. I do also find the transformers hard to engage with as characters.They'd be better off embracing the absurdity and making the movies much more flashy, joyous and funny.",6,2,2,17 July 2016
The Godfather," Long, slow but with great performances
","I'd been putting off watching The Godfather for some time. Probably because I knew it was a long, weighty movie with a massive reputation and I wanted to make sure I gave it justice.Well I finally took the plunge and watched it, and I'm sorry to say I don't know what all the fuss is about. This probably won't be very popular - but this movie is way way too slow. There is a lot of talking and very little action, which would be OK if the dialogue was special - it isn't.What saves The Godfather for me is the performances. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in particular - you can tell they are at the peak of their powers and giving the performance everything. Their characters are complex and interesting. Brando as Don Vito Corleone is a criminal but with a good heart. Al Pacino wants to avoid crime but he has a streak of evil in him. The development of the characters and handover of the criminal empire keeps the otherwise dull storyline ticking over.I've given this movie a 7/10 on the strength of the performance, but I won't be watching it again.",7,1,2,13 June 2014
