Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than expected
","Well, I've heard a lot about Episode 1. In fact, so much, that I've almost given in to the mostly negative critics and did not watch the movie. Now I'm glad that I did watch it. OK, there are some things that SHOULD have been better: - There was not enough time to develop the characters. - Darth Maul was reduced from a real Jedi-counterpart to a simple villain - In details the movie was too childish Nonetheless, Episode 1 has so much that helped me forget these 'mistakes' during the movie: It has a superb cast, an excellent music score, really stunning special effects and an exciting story full of action. All in all Episode 1 surely fits not perfect into the Star Wars universe. But you should see it as the first part of a trilogy (as the original Star Wars was, with all its insufficiencies) - and as this, it serves not only well but is a very good start. I do look forward for the next episode, where George Lucas hopefully will erase all the insufficient details.",4,10,14,24 August 1999
Notting Hill," Too much Hollywood
","It squints for 'Four Weddings And A Funeral', but in fact it is a 'Pretty Woman'-flick with swapped roles. The story (beautiful actress falls in love with a clumsy but smart english bookseller) is merely unbelievable - e.g. in the scene where Julia kisses Hugh right out of the blue. This does not necessarily disqualify the movie, if it's made well. But only in a few scenes it reaches the quality of humor that 'Four Weddings' had. And were Hugh's friends all of the 'weird english'? Speaking of Hugh Grant brings me to the weakest part of the movie: himself. While Julia Roberts at least does her best to look nice, Hugh is a wooden carbon-copy of his greatest roles. Thank god the supporting cast is very good, but, as I said, it gets not enough space to show it.",8,0,0,3 September 1999
The Thing," The Most Underrated Horror Movie Ever
","The One Line Summary above says it all. Never before a horror film was so much ahead of his time as this one. The special effects shown were so natural, so bloody, so disgusting....it must've been a severe shock for the average 1982 audience. Apart from the (even now) extreme effects, The Thing offers thrill at its best: an interesting bunch of characters bound together in a strange location (you can almost feel the loneliness of the snowcapped landscape) and a slowly increasing suspense culminating to an inevitable ending.",10,0,1,22 September 1999
Heat," The definite crime story!
","I've recently seen 'Heat' for the third time, and I loved it like I did when I saw it the first time. Even my fiancee liked it, and she normally hates Action moves. Most of the other comments have already mentioned the fantastic cast, led by De Niro and Pacino (who bring out the best of their supporting actors and actresses), the realistic action sequences, the unforgettable music and the touching story. There is a small detail I would like to add: The length. It is not one minute too long. In contrary, I could've watched an hour or so more, it is one of the few movies where I was quite sad when it was over and done.  We all complain about flat characters in the movies. Then one man dares to change it and is criticized for. Michael Mann showed no fear to develop his characters and this does need certain time!! There are only two bad things about 'Heat': First, it ends! Second, how could any movie in this category try to top it? I rate it 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,9 September 1999
Jackie Brown," Just boring.
","There is nothing more to say, I'm sorry for Quentin. This one is about 100 minutes too long. If you want to see how to make a movie after an Elmore Leonard story - go see 'Out Of Sight'. Not even the excellent cast and some very interesting stylish manners can save 'Jackie Brown' from simple boredom.",5,8,20,27 August 1999
