The Blair Witch Project," great at making you scared
","Firstly to the sceptics... If you have ever gone hiking in the woods and been lost with a bunch of mates no older than 20 you would completely understand everything that goes on in this film. Group dynamics fall apart and the so-called leader, leads the group astray. Fortunately most of these events turn out good however something else is at work in this film.Whilst I have an objection to complete improvisation in a film it has worked very well for this one. The authenticity of what happens is frighteningly chilling. People our age swear  worse than those in that film. There is always an annoying 'chick' you drives people insane over their petty little causes. The characters were not written leaving room for faults and inconsistencies we see in everyday cinema. But rather they were constructed by people who most likely were those characters in real life. Good acting is not acting at all.Being in the army I know what it is like to be up at night in the cold because you heard noises (only in training). Most of the time it is gunshots but not all the time. Your cold, you wanna sleep and you are scared simply because it is night (and if it were real you'd probably be dead). Hence those night scenes, the darkness, the cold, and the noises really hit home and play on the primal fear of the dark and the unknown. Unlike every other 'scary' film out now, this one leaves it all up to your imagination, the most powerful tool! You can think of so much more than you can see and that scares people.My recomendation is experience the film in a dark place with good sound and think of those times you got scared as a kid or a teenager in the night. Then you may understand what the people in the film are going through. And even though it is not real, it is still a landmark achievement in making you scared! not just of the film, but every time that light goes out and the cold air fills the place!",Null,0,1,13 October 1999
Fight Club," question reality but in a normal way
","There is but one word to describe this film ... Clever.The fad today seems to be questioning reality, 'Dark City' and 'The Matrix' are two such examples. Ity appears we wish so hard to really be something else, something with no rules, limits, or boundaries were we can do anything we like. Surprisingly enough that is exactly what this film is about.Forget any elaborate setup, forget about a plot that makes sense, disregard conventional filmmaking and shot composition and remember this film is about a message! Plain and simple!Many films have a theme or a point and they present it to the audience for your judgement. This film kicks you in the nuts and slams its opinion down your throat while you are vunerable. The genius of it all is when you discover that what you thought was happening had nothing to do with what was happening. The line 'we are the all-singing all-dancing crap of the world' summs up the whole film and is a refreshing look at that old term 'Carpe Deim' in a very 90's sense of the word. So nineties in fact that even you the viewer may require counselling after seeing this film.Unlike films like 'the Matrix' there was not tool of thing as it were that allowed the main character to alter his lifes boundaries and rules. He had the guts to go through with it all and in the end it was himself that had got him to were he was and that is what I admire most about the film.I give this film a huge thumbs up and recommend it to everyone and leave a small suggestion as well. Take in what the film has to say and maybe even give it a go someday.",Null,0,1,29 November 1999
