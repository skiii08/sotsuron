Black Swan," Is this movie awesome or is it just plain horrible? A bit of both, because it's just plain awesome!
","How does one follow up to the critically acclaimed and wonderful film that is known as 'The Wrestler'? Qutie simple really, one just presents Black Swan.When Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) finally wins the starring part of Swan Queen in the ballet spectacle of Swan Lake, nothing could be better. HA! Not a chance when director Darren Aronofsky is in charge of the center stage production. As accustomed, Aranofsky manages to bring the beautiful elegancy of ballet and cleverly change it into a psychological thriller where Nina's dream turns into the most real of nightmares while we watch her desperate struggle to overcome it.Black Swan is clearly one of the best films of 2010 and Natalie Portman's performance is surely worthy of the Oscar. On the surface, this movie may seem like just a movie about ballet, but to all the men out there with this mindset, I just say it really isn't.(there is quite a 'naughty' scene involving two females) Aronofsky has once again shown his brilliance in Black Swan.",9,1,3,29 January 2011
