Blade Runner 2049," What's happening and why do I care?
","This has been my main question throughout the movie. What's happening and why do I even care? The first hour is just Gosling brooding and acting all emo while he moves from one scene to the next. I have no idea why those replicas needed to be hunted down or why they kept testing him over and over. The movie lacks tension or a sense of direction and it is less a story and more a series of scenes happening to maybe establish something later.When the big bad come along I snorted, he was just so pretentious. OK we established that you're evil for the sake of being evil, where's the fast forward button.The movie is boring with long stretches of silence or nothing happening then a burst of 'emotions' happening out of nowhere and for no reason that half the theater actually started giggling at them. I'm not sure those scenes where intentionally funny though.By the time the big events happens it's the last 40 minutes of the movie that attempts to glue all the scenes together thinking it's deep and clever. It wasn't, it really wasn't. and by then I stopped caring.Visually I thought it was nice at first but it was so pretentious and trying so hard to be deep that it ended up looking like a generic late 90's movie.",3,22,56,7 October 2017
Vertigo," Over-rated sellout
","Alfred Hitchcock is the master of thrills and mysteries... so knowing that he made this just makes me hate it even more.Every old Hollywood glam clich√© is thrown at you. you like elegant women staring off into the horizon? damsels in distress? Kissing on the beach and the waves crash in the background?This movie's got you covered!The plot is straight forward enough, you know what's happening ten minutes in, what the movie banks on however is your investment in the character and watching their decent into obsession.The actors were pretty good (though those eyebrows were distracting... did she use a sharpie to make them?) and the overall movie very scenic but it didn't feel like a Hitchcock movie until the very last scene, that's you're only clue to who could have this twisted sense of justice. otherwise it just felt like a sell-out, this is popular so do this, people like that so add it in... One of my least liked movies by Hitchcock, skip it and watch a good one like rear window.",4,4,9,18 May 2016
It," Creepy but boring
","For those that don't know This is a re-make of the Stephen King classic (IT), the book was made into a mini-series in 1990 staring Tim Curry as Pennywise. Now credit where it's due, the kids in the movie are amazing! I was strongly reminded of the cast in (stranger things) they were so good all around.praise over now to the issues I had with it... The movie was a bit off for me, whenever a character was separated from a group he'd wonder around a dark empty place (as you do) and you are just waiting for Pennywise to show up. again and again they just repeated that cycle.I think there were only one or two jump scares in the whole movie and I appreciated that but over all it got predictable quick, oh look that one kid left the group and is wondering in the woods/sewer/haunted house/library all alone, gee I wonder what will happen...It didn't help that that Pennywise here was less of a character and more CGI effect, he was very off putting and the way he moved was just odd. Frankly I found George (the baby brother) creepier! I cringed every time he laughed.I have seen episodes of (Are you afraid of the dark) scarier then this. If you want to feel creepy but in an uncomfortable way then this is for you. Might want to take a rent it though, you'll need to take a few breaks to get through it to break the monotony. I give this one 4/10, all four stars go to the 7 child actors, they've earned it.",4,4,8,16 September 2017
Captain Marvel," To quote every disney princess ever 'I wanted more.'
","Welcome to the 90's. Allow us to throw this bucket of decade puck all over the movie so you know it's the 90's!Other then that the movie is very paint by numbers with meh mediocre visuals.Brie Larson as Carol/Captian Marvel is given a very gender specific backstory. Boy are never told to reel it in, that they're too emotional, to slow down. This is something most women hear growing up and would have had more of emotional impact had the acting been better... or existent.The CGI is mediocre with no stand out scenes.The plot was well written and layered with a lot to say in a 'show don't tell' kind of way but sadly the movie didn't live up to it's potential and maintained a flat tone throughout.I really wish I liked this more. I really, really, REALLY wanted to like it more... but I just feel indifferent towards it making it seem more like a side story - prequel for Avanger's End game instead of it's own thing.",6,1,2,8 March 2019
Zootopia," An adult Movie in camouflage
","Zootopia is a Disney movie so it goes without saying that it will be BEAUTIFUL! But it's something else as well, this is a smart movie with clever writing and some very adult jokes sneaked in there but it'll take you a second to get them. ExampleThe bunny is doing some math to calculate taxes, in the middle of of the equation she says 'and because bunnies are good at multiplying we carry the four and ....etc' I laughed at the joke but it went by so fast that my group missed it and it took them a minute to get it.Is this a good movie? Yes, yes it is... but.... the message is hammed in and it's such a basic message that even a child knows. Racism is bad, don't judge people on racial stereotypes. It's a good message and the movie does deliver it in a clever way, but it could have been better, the children in the theater were getting bored and antsy mid way through which is never a good sign for a movie aimed at kids (marketing wise)To me this felt more like a movie aimed at adults but because of the Disney name had to wear kid friendly camouflage.Give it a go but expect to like it more then your kids will.",7,5,18,7 March 2016
The Babadook," Baba dook dook DOOK!
","I'm a bit torn with this movie. it's a low budget independent film that makes zero attempt to hide that fact, nothing fancy here just one really creepy movie.My main beef with it is the first 30 minute set up, ever had to suffer through a birthday party with a million fussy kids screaming in your ears? yep that's all condensed into one kid that takes the spot light throughout the first one third of the movie with a mother who just looks on helplessly... Now the main event follows as the babadook 'makes his presence known' indirectly in the movie, none of the classic jump scares or gore- ific scenes that usual films have. just that creepy undertone that keeps the suspense tight.If you manage to get through the first one third of the film (yes this is a film, not a movie. big difference!) you'll find something creative and haunting. it lost points for the really bad start that made me lose interest and shelve the DVD for weeks before watching it again.",6,3,5,19 January 2016
Us," Interesting, Creepy and surprisingly funny
","As a horror movie this one is more about the creep factor rather than cheap jump scares or gore.Divided into three parts you first get to know the main characters and the environment. Act two is when the doppelgangers arrive bringing the horror element with them. The third act is Lupita Nyong'o creeping you out and keeping you at the edge of your seat as things are kindda being explained.Here is when this breaks down. Although the idea is interesting, the actors individually are great (even the child actors) I don't buy them as a family. The best parts are when they each get separated and get the chance to creep you out. The third act is an exposition dump that contradicts the main idea of the movie itself so doesn't really work and brings the whole thing down.That being said the hour and half that came before the third act are amazing with both humor and action as well as great atmosphere making it easy to ignore the failings of the third act.",7,3,4,25 March 2019
Knives Out," Slow burn but a big finish
","If you've ever been caught up with a Will dispute then you'll recognize the characters in this one. All entitled, despicable, small minded and always, always, ALWAYS bickering. Sounds like a family reunion to me!
As a murder mystery this is a bit slow on the start with Daniel Craig playing the small time country lawy--- errrrr detective Benoit Blanc who was hired to solve the case.
Some decent twists and turns, a juicy red herring and good intentions that pave the way to hell.
It comes with a really big finish saving the best for the last. Overall this one it fun with very grounded family dynamics considering the type of family this is.",7,2,5,5 December 2019
Deadpool 2," Funny movie but not as good as the first
","While this movie has an estimated budget double that of the first and feels bigger plot and location wise.... bigger doesn't always mean better. The movie recycles the plot of terminator 2 with Cable (played by Thanos AKA Josh Brolin) looking so much like him that I was just waiting for that joke to come up.... spoiler, it never does. The Movie has quite a few funny scenes and at times it feels like it's trolling the audience with how they subvert your expectations which I loved. Other times however I questioned some of the choices made as they felt like a rehash of the jokes in part one. Cable and Dominos where amazing and the highlight of this movie which kindda makes it wasteful since it takes awhile for them to make their entrance.Is this a fun movie? Yes, it's a good one for a night out. Is it epic and memorable like the first one? No, the first one was tight and the jokes landed way way WAY more often.
IMPORTANT! There are two end credit scenes (actually Mid-credit). Make sure to stay for the second one, it alone is worth the ticket price. Hands down saving the best for last.",7,1,3,26 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Fun but weak tea
","The interaction between the characters carries this movie. Chris Hemsworth (as Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (as Loki) carry this movie with the light hearted brother's act. Jeff Goldblum as the grandmaster was just the right amount of ham sandwich. every second he had on screen he owned.The movie was fun and bright with Hel being the big bad that must be defeated this time. The movie got a few chuckles out of me and kept me entertained. However plot wise it was really weak. Hela is doing her thing in Asgard, Thor and Loki is in god knows where doing there thing and met this random person that turns out to be also from Asgard and another avenger to boot... to many coincidences don't make for a strong plot. Then there was the rock guy. He seriously weighed the movie down and no that wasn't an intended pun! Personally I got a strong guardians of the galaxy clone off this movie which is a shame. I would have been happy just watching the actors work of each other. There is also some lack of creativity in the movie as it re-uses previous jokes -the iconic puny god moment, the funny 'he's adopted' line. all re-used- It was like Loki's fan-fiction come to the big screen.In the end this is a fun popcorn movie, sadly compared to others marvel had put out it's near the bottom.",7,1,4,4 November 2017
Ready Player One," This is not the book.... at all!
","The movie is an adaptation from the book of the same name. The writer himself Ernest Cline is created as one of screenplay writers which suprised me. This movie... has nothing to do with the book. I expected a few changes, that's normal considering the amount of references to pop culture in the book and how licensing works for movie adaptations. Thing is even the plot, characters and end message were changed. This went from a coming of age story, a boy learning that escaping to 'his oasis' is not the solution. You have to fight for what you want. sacrifice everything for those you care about. There is also a message in there regarding the dangers of corporate takeover of the net, seven full years before the net neutrality issue came up. What does this one do? The challenges are changed completely. The characters that he meets along the way and is united with them against a common enemy are his buddies from the beginning. Even the lesson changes to simply... the power of friendship. That's it. Oh and gaming is for the young that love to play not corporate thugs, who fund their development and market them in the first place. To me this is such a childish plot it's barely a six star movie however because of all the nostalgia they throw at you and the epicness of the final battle I'm adding one extra star. I'll admit, it was nice seeing some of my favorite characters from the 80's and 90's on the screen battling it out. The kid in me liked it but the adult that I am was disappointed with the overall emptiness.",7,1,4,29 March 2018
Moana," A remake of the little mermaid in disguise
","This has been the closest Disney ever came to realism with their characters. we get 'almost' real looking characters with conversations you can relate to. the Hair looks so real and the water is a character by itself.. a likable one too!It was nice to see the company be more culturally aware with the material and portray the island myths and legends properly.As a movie however it is someone lack luster, there are so many call backs to Disney's little mermaid that I was just waiting for a kraken to pop up instead of ursula. You have a girl *coughprincesscough* that 'wants more' that wants to see what's beyond the borders of her home and a father *coughkingcough* that forbids it. doesn't give her a reason just forbids it. Even when the reason is given it's the same one king trident had in the TV series of the little mermaid!If that's not enough when she finally sings her song she gives the same iconic stand as Arial does when the was crash behind her. it was eerie... As a whole the visuals were beautiful, characters almost too realistic but the movie is an average one with a very straight forward predictable plot.",7,5,16,5 December 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Finally a good Spider-man AND Peter Parker Movie!
","We are now at the third re-boot of the spider-man movies.... AND IT'S NOT AN ORIGIN STORY!!! Thank you Marvel!The Movie starts from that cameo in Captain America and just keeps going from there. Peter met the great Tony Stark and is now star struck. the movie is him trying to prove that he's not just a kid in need of gloves but a man and totally Avenger material!A coming of age story of a 15 year old kid still in school, what could be more Spider-man then that! Tom Holland (as our hero) Is very charming as both personas and pretty much carries this movie... which brings me to the negative part, I'm not sure if this was done on purpose but all the supporting case in this movie acted like they've never been in front of a camera before. Aunt May, Liz (the love interest) and his best friend Ned were down right annoying at times and awkward the rest of it. There is rest of the supporting cast were just too obvious in their roles that it just felt forced. There was Zero chemistry on screen...The Antagonist however is another story, Micheal Keaton as the 'vulture' was down right menacing and I don't think he had to raise his voice once to achieve that. Easily one of the more memorable villains in the MCU!The Movie has a quirky sense of humor which will have you smiling, and if that doesn't get you stick around to the end credit scene. Overall this was an enjoyable movie, the supporting cast and some of the choices they made (The actually tried to play it safe here) weighed the movie down a bit for me. I'd give it a 6/10 but it got an extra star due to the amazing performances by Holland and Keaton, those two carried this movie on steal (and web!) wings!",7,1,4,8 July 2017
Suicide Squad," My little pony: friendship is magic
","Saying this movie lost the plot would be inaccurate as it did NOT have a plot to begin with!The first hour is spent introducing the main characters as stand alone criminals that are now locked up in solitary.So half the movie, half the movie is just telling you that your 'heroes' are the bad guys, they don't play well with others, they're only looking out for number one AND that they've had little to no contact with each other.Then they're in a team to defeat the villain that aims to... to... I think it was rule the world or destroy it, it was never made clear what the villain's aim was or how they would do it. it was just bad guy, that's their location, go!You know what, the avengers was a group of heroes with a common goal and even they had growing pains forming a team. the interactions made that movie. Here they pulled a my little pony friendship is magic stunt (not kidding regarding the pony, they actually throw a pink one at you in slow motion!) so the previous hour was wasted... the team is well coordinated and the members are willing to die for each other... the selfish criminals, who've only known each other for less then a day... and Kitana is somehow with them to for no reason what so ever, she just joined them!I really wanted to love this movie, Harley Quinn is my fav. DC character and Will Smith (playing Deadshot) is just so charming... and you love both in this movie but...The visuals are amazing though sometimes they make no sense, the character design is eye catching and the effects are nice.however plot wise they pretty much threw a few DC characters into a blender and hit the on the button hoping for hit.Overall it's a poor movie BUT still enjoyable because of the stand alone characters. I would recommend renting it if only for the dialogue.",4,2,4,11 August 2016
Doctor Strange," A super fun LSD trip!!!
","I was really looking forward to this movie but I was a bit worried about it. first of all the origin story of Doctor Strange is... strange... not as a whole but at the root of it you have a man of science and logic asked to leave that behind and believe in magic, in whole new world beyond this one.... and why wouldn't he in a world were gods walk among us with their thunder hammers and a man from the 40's was thawed to fight again? Magic in such a world just seems like a given, why would he be so strongly against it?The other thing is Cumberbatch, he is such a strong presence on screen that I worried it might not work as a super hero movie, that I would only see him as cumberbatch. The GOOD =Well the movie was just the right amount of serious and popcorn fun, it was light hearted enough to give you a little chuckle every now and then but still heavy enough to make you feel like what's happening is important. a good mix and what marvel does best! The BAD =There are a few.... lets call them howky choices made, the car accident was over the top and after it I just wondered how he survived with just a hand fracture, by all accounts he should have lost a limb or two at least!!!! I also don't get love of kaleidoscope in the effects, there was something in the movie that made it look like it was made in the late 70's early 80's with the use of those effects but then some AMAZING crazy effect will happen that'll bring you back to the here and now it was an odd mix. The humor here is good, it seems to defuse a serious moment at times which I get but just think some worked to the films credit and others lessened a big moment.Summery =A fun movie Amazing performances crazy effects Watch it! 8.5/10",8,2,4,5 November 2016
Justice League," Almost Marvel
","This was a really, really, REALLY good movie. I generally avoid anything DC puts out -I have yet to see the wonder woman movie honestly- So I went into this one with no expectations what so ever. This could have taken a few deadend turns along the way easily... BUT it didn't.Superman was the hero that actually cares about civilians, he had a sense of humor and he actually smiled here. A DC character that actually smiles without being holier then thou!!! Also and this is a big also, he's suit has colour! imagine that, a DC movie with colours!Unlike Suicide Squad that spent a full hour on character intro before throwing it away and going friendship is magic. This one allows the characters to introduce themselves for a few minutes before they each actually act according to that character. Be it joining the team full of youthful eagerness or just put up the middle finger and walk away. The movie was entertaining, bright and interesting from beginning to end. Worth the watch.It lost a star because the special effects where a bit distracting, especially on cyborg and at the very end. They needed some work however they weren't horrendous. Ben Affleck's Batman was a bit weird here but it was less the actor and more the script. The lines were very hit or miss.",8,1,4,18 November 2017
Split," Pretty Good
","Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan I'll be the first to admit that seeing his name in HUGE bold letters on the theater screen before the movie started made me instinctively want to bolt for the door!That being said.... I think we've found his niche! low budget thrillers that focus on one idea and a handful of actors.This movie can be summarized in one line, A guy with multiple personality disorders kidnaps 3 girls. That's really, whatever happens from there just builds up from that one line depending only on the character interactions.James McAvoy (in the role of the guy with 23 personalities that I am to lazy to name) shines! even without the wardrobe change you can till when he is playing a different personality by the little changes that happen and you can't wait for him to be on screen again.well paced and interesting from beginning to end this is a solid movie. it lost one star because the twist (hey it's Shyamalan! you have to expect it!) wasn't really a twist per say... Not saying it's bad just that I didn't care for it. 8/10",8,3,12,11 February 2017
Captain America: Civil War," The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
","THE GOODStoryline is interesting with some really good writing, the interactions between the cast feel almost organic in nature and got the biggest laugh out of the crowd in my theater. The 'I hate you but not really' thing between Falcon and Bucky Barnes (played by Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan) was subtle but very funny.The Movie Also gave us the best Peter Parker so far (played by Tom Holland) with him being an awkward teen just trying his best and a little star struck with all those big names around him.Introducing black panther to the marvel world actually added to the movie, he was beyond amazing and stole every scene he was in!Imagery, lighting and music all created an intense atmosphere.THE BADshaky cam... why the shaky cam all of a sudden when everything was perfect throughout the movie why suddenly switch to what looks like a hand held crappy phone camera in the bomb scene? The action scene in the beginning was speed up and in 3D was down right headache inducing, my eyes just couldn't keep up. This happens in one other fight scene and is just as annoying.... this one is a knitpick but there was a scene or two that was there purely as eye candy, I can see it as desktop wallpaper to be honest but because the scene leading up to it was so intense and full of emotions that final picturesque shot just cheapens things...THE UGLYWhy... in gods name is Aunt May a hottie? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU RUSSOS!!! Nothing you say can justify this, it was there to attract the male population for the spidey movie, as if having the name 'spiderman' on the poster wasn't enough!!!OK, I just had to let that one off my chest. overall good movie if you can get past the first 45 - 60 minutes. once the actual conflict takes place the movie starts getting interesting.",8,5,10,7 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Dan Fogler is the CUTEST!!!!
","Dan Fogler who plays Kowalski is easily the best thing in this movie, he's so hug-able!!!! It's almost worth it to see this in the theater just to watch him.... almost.I wanted to judge this as it's own thing and not as part of the Harry Potter world but it's clear the movie wants you to associate it with HP from the opening theme to name dropping Hogwarts and Dumbledore, their target audience is obvious. This is the main problem, as a movie this is pretty muddled, unlike HP that created a separate world for wizards and witches here there is no line between them, no wonder, all shades of beige of the 1920's with a colourful bug thrown in there and lets call that bug the magic... The writing is also surprisingly generic from someone amazing as J.K. Rowling, you can easily predict the next line of dialogue and there are no magic spells, seriously sometimes they say nothing and just point the wand for it to do things like a gun!!!! did they forget how this is supposed to work? The plot is weak at best, contrive a reason for the main to go to the U.S., have the beasts be whatever the plots need them to be etc... not what'd you'd expect from a great writer.The weakest element is the main and the villain, Eddie Redmayne is forgettable in this and I don't even know who the underlying villain of all this is (the one in the newspaper) who doesn't remember he who must not be named? and what's with the child abuse story in there? it seemed odd in such a movie to have that, the kids in the theater were actually scared and some parents left!Overall an OK but meh movie that is more suitable for TV then the theater and requires focus (and a point beyond milking HP fans!) Also if you have motion sickness take your pills before entering, they do the 3D ride thing with the effects and the 3D bug popping out of the screen at you which was really annoying and distracting.",6,0,10,19 November 2016
Avengers: Endgame," The Perfect ending
","The movie is 3 hours long. Not once did I look at my watch or feel the need to take a break. You are entertained from the gutsy opening scene to the very last frame.It's funny, it's dramatic and it's larger than life. Everything you might want in an 'end game' after over ten years of build up.If the movie had a flaw (big IF) is that this is made for the fans that have watched ALL the movies. A billion characters and just as many references and call backs. Unlike the previous movie this one is not a stand alone, you need to know the backstories to understand it..... also the plot is a bit iffy but the movie is so good you sorta give it a pass.If you can actually grab a ticket go see it. This one needs to be seen in the theater to enjoy the epicness on screen.",9,1,7,30 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel characters.... ASSEMBLE!
","This movie includes every single marvel character so far even the guardians. There was a lot of build up for this one movie considering Thanos is the final boss in this game. As someone that went into this movie blind I was 100% sure that there was no way Marvel could deliver. I stand correct. Beautifully shot, whimsical effects and well written their isn't a dull moment in the entire run time. I think Marvel heard the common complain about the villains being forgettable and death not mattering in the MCU... they said 'Here, hold my beer!' Thanos is so well developed that he puts loki to shame. The guardians (and Thor) still managed to steal the show but with such a large cast of heroes it's understandable that some will shine brighter. I would recommend watching this in a full theater, maybe sneak in a few teens and kids and watch their reactions to the last act. We are so sure the heroes and popular characters are safe in movies and it's the side or new characters that are on shaky grounds that emotions were running high by the end. If you've watched any of the marvel movies then this is a must for you!",10,1,5,26 April 2018
A Quiet Place," Suspenseful
","The movie deals with a very basic concept. What if monsters attacked you based on sound. That really is it. You follow the Abbott family in this dystonia where every movement, every breath has to be done as quietly and delicately as possible. Even something as basic as taking a pill bottle off a shelf is suspenseful as you hold your breath wondering if it'll be too loud.Watching this in a crowded theater it was amazing how loud opening a bag of chips sounded (and yes I stopped and shoved it under the chair. I'm sorry!) The actors were very expressive as they had to use facial expressions and sign language to get their point across wordlessly. Whenever sound was present in the movie it gave you a jump. Millicent Simmonds was amazing as the daughter and Emily Blunt's performance as the mother put everyone on the edge of their seats.The only reason I'm removing two stars is that there was a glaring plot hole in this movie. Monsters who are sensitive to sound, so much so that loud noises and high frequencies repel them would stay away from humans generally and humans in a large city specifically... Thankfully the focus of the movie was the family which gives it somewhat of a pass. Go see it and DO NOT buy anything crunchy, comes in a plastic bag or slurps before you go in the theater!",8,2,3,7 May 2018
Hidden Figures," Hidden Fences
","Sorry I couldn't help myself with the title to this review. honestly though the fences are not so hidden... unless you choose to not see them that is.The movie is based on a true story from 1961, where segregation was still a thing so NASA being the progressive unit it is was ahead of it's time, in that it separated black women into a fact and number checking temp agency within it's walls with zero chance of advancement.unlike most movies that deal with this issue however, this one follows three smart, well educated and dignified ladies from that division showing them not as victims of the times but fighters that quietly and very slyly climb up the ladder (or scale the wall that built in front of the ladder to be fair!) and make something of themselves using their heads and adapting to the ever changing times.Katherine G. Johnson (played by the adorable Taraji P. Henson) was quirky and showed a lot of dedication. Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer) was simply amazing! She was sassy in a way done right! and of course my personal fav. the flirty Mary Jackson (played the beautiful Janelle Mon√°e) put a smile on my face whenever she was on screen.The movie gets your attention from the opening scene (and it's a good one!) and once you're hooked your in for the long haul as it'll keep you interested from beginning to end. You are show the ugly face of segregation as a fact of life that these women don't fight but rather try to work around and how people can be cruel without even realizing it. I would recommend this to everyone, it was a lovely and (oddly enough given the subject it deals with) inspiring! an easy 10/10 and I'm glad a movie like this was made to shine the light on those that have worked so hard behind the curtain.",10,1,7,4 March 2017
Coco," Unexpected.
","This Movie wasn't even on my radar. I had dismissed it as a book of life copycat. Well it does deal with Dios dela muertos however the story, tone and visuals are completely different. Miguel (voiced by the lively Anthony Gonzalez) dreams of becoming a musician like his ideal. His family however disapproves... strongly disapproves and wants him to follow in the family business of shoe making. In an act of rebellion he finds himself in the land of the dead and needs his family's blessing to get home. Thing is even his dead ancestors disapprove of his dream and want him to give it up. The graphics are stunning and the amount of detail given to everything is staggering, one of the characters. A scruffy skeleton by the name of Hector looked like he had a little scratch on his cheek but later in the movie when the lighting is better and his face is angled just right you notice that no, it's not a scratch. it's part of an interact design similar to the one on sugar skulls. He's just so scruffy that the design is really subtle and only shows when the the light hits him just right.The comedy is cut, the characters heart warming and it has some very down to earth characters (a granny that hits you with her shoe? reminds me of someone I actually know) To top it off all the skeletons and having a kid be in danger, real danger. had the kids in the audience's attention without scaring them. My theater was full of jumpy children but once the movie started not one left his seat or said anything but the occasion 'ohhh..' 'haha' while a lot of adults reached for their napkins to hide the tears. A beautiful movie and well worth sitting through the 20 minute frozen merchandise commercial that came before it. (please pick up the new Elsa dress for your five year old once you leave the theater!)",8,1,4,9 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I forgot it before I even left the theater
","This is a bad movie, don't get fooled by all the phantom mencing that's happening. It gets an A+ on visuals, everything was beautiful and filmed in a way that got your attention. That's all the praise I have for this. The plot and characters are so muddled that I forgot what the driving plot of it was WHILE I was watching it. They try to play a twist regarding who's good and who's bad with so many characters that it's just annoying and makes no sense in the end. There is an attempt to add depth to Kylo Ren by the end of this but it's so muddled and contrived that it held no weight. The movie is directionless, boring, full of weird filler and their attempt at humor failed this time with only a few hits here and there. I know that you're going to see this movie anyways and buy the merchandise -looks at her $20 popcorn holder shaped like BB8's head- but just know this one kindda sucks.",3,1,2,16 December 2017

","It's 2029, the mutants are no more and old man Logan is finally starting to show his age, the beloved Prof. is senile and they all live on Logan's part-time job as an uber driver. uplifting right?This movie is a blatant transition movie, the baton is passed from the X-men we all know and love to the next generation as their kids/clones show up with powers that mimic one of the older generation (electricity, healing, magnetic? powers...etc)Hugh Jackman gave a stellar performance as wolverine and every minute he's on screen is pure joy.... but that's all the movie offers you, Patrick Stewart was given a poor role, he played it well but to see an icon reduced to 'a senile old man' is just sad. The child lead Laura (played by Dafne Keen) was OK and her action scenes are AMAZING but she was written oddly, she spends the first two hours of the movie on mute, then talks in Spanish exclusively, then she can magically speak English for the finale, it was distracting.Overall this movie is boring which is actually odd considering how great the action scenes were. it's a 6/10 but deserves one extra point because of Hugh Jackman's performance.",7,3,8,14 March 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Flat Soda
","OK so I'm that one person you know that hates that movie or TV show that the whole world loves, the snobbish hipster that just shrugs off the popular and goes for the one thing that people won't look at twice.But you know what, even if I didn't like the original Beauty and the beast I still acknowledged it's beauty and mastery. this one was just flat and oddly directed...WORST PARTS = <ul><li>The songs, just imagine a dove flying in the air... it now dropped like a rock to the pavement and somehow changed into a filthy pigeon along the way. that's the songs in this film and sadly there are so many of them that it's almost a musical, also for the iconic ones from the classic the comparisons just make them worst.</li></ul><ul><li>The shot framing, there is something very weird with how this was directed. it's like you don't know where you are supposed to focus on, everything blends with everything and the thing that was supposed to stand out... doesn't.... this really shows in the village song as Bella blends rather then stand out.</li></ul><ul><li>CGI.... although the details on the furniture is lovely the whole effect is more nightmare fuel (that wardrobe is creepy and yet they love it so much that they keep zooming in on it!) </li></ul><ul><li>Bella. No offense to Emma Watson but she can't sing and this is almost a musical so she sounds flat and it brings her entire preformace down, whenever she's on screen I'm just bored.</li></ul><ul><li>The Songs/Musicals, it bears repeating how flat they were and there are just A lot of them.</li></ul>BEST PARTS<ul><li>Gaston and LeFou, They provided the humor and MUCH needed energy, seriously everything else in this film is so flat and everyone sounds so bored that those two are the only ones that look and sound like they're having fun.</li></ul><ul><li>The costume designs, those are actually really beautiful and vibrant.</li></ul><ul><li>The third act is actually good and high in energy, I guess they wanted to wake you up before you leave the theater.</li></ul>I'll just note that nostalgia is a factor which elevated this movie a bit, I can see people liking it for that as it is a serviceable movie for that...",5,2,5,2 April 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Action, drama, comedy and might even be better then the first one!
","I went into the movie blind, I expected something OK-ish but Vol.3 might actually be better then the first one!The movie focuses more on developing the characters and shedding some light on their back stories making them more solid as people... well almost everyone, oddly enough there is just one character in the whole movie that doesn't gain any depth and yet manages to steal every single scene he's in and that's Drax (played by he of the infectious laugh Dave Bautista)Fast paced and action filled what really shines in this flick is oddly enough it's comedic timing and choice of sound track, The humor here comes at you from left field (or from Drax, just him laughing will tickle your funny bone!) so it's never expected. They try to push baby groot's cuteness a bit much for my taste and I did end up liking the rougher characters more (Rocket, Yondu and Drax) which more then made up for it. This was the first movie that made me want to run and get the sound track, I think the music here is even better then the first one.10/10 from me, I'd recommend it to the whole family, even though there is violence in the movie it's done in a tongue and cheek way and never 'too' grotesque,,, it's hard to think 'oh dear he killed everyone' when you're laughing so hard!",10,45,81,6 May 2017
Sausage Party," Hilarious AND Smart!
","Would it be bias if I said I went into this movie with expectations so low they had to look up to see down?from the poster to the dirty pun in the title it was setting itself itself up to be a flop (pun unintended but there you go!)The subject of this movie is pretty straight forward, there is no god, no 'great beyond' no nothing. it's a LIE!!!! fill it up with sex jokes and low brow humoryeah, yeah heard it all before so what's new... the way it was told was new, the references were actually smart and characters likable.This movie is a lot better then it had any right to be and I was entertained from beginning to end. it's been awhile since I've seen anything new in a movie, mostly it's the same committee brainstormed story over and over, remake this re-do that and for godsake don't you dare try to be original.if you see just one animated movie this year.... well see whatever Disney is churning out but watch this one to, it's funny, smart. likable and climax with a bang.... literally!!!! the meta aspect of it will make you smile.I highly recommend this move, just keep in mind that the R rating was well earned here so don't make the mistake of taking kids or teens along.",10,11,24,16 December 2016
Joker," You love it or hate it, no inbetween.
","Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is a story about isolation, loneliness and not fitting in. It's about being appreciated and the center of attention but only in your own head. In the real world things just suck and nobody cares.
The acting is top shelf and there is a raw quality to the movie. Thing is, this is a character study. The things you are used to like 500 million dollars worth of special effects, side characters arcs or even a plot is not there. It's just one man having a very, very, very bad day... all his life. If you relate then you'll love it but I can see people getting antsy and hating it due to the lack of over the top action or effects.
Either way this one is worth at least one viewing for the acting alone.",8,2,5,30 November 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," A decent adaptation that gets better as the film goes.
","I grew up with Christie's books and David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. The thing with 'who don it' mysteries is that if you know the ending then your experience will differ from that who's seeing it for the first time. Is this a decent adaptation of the book? Yes, they followed the plot and a lot of attention was paid to the little details to make it look like an actual train from the 1920's. Up until the end the theater was full of murmurs 'who did it? who was it then?' and even though I knew I was still interested in the movie till the end.One thing that lowers this movie's score is Hercule Poirot himself. As a fan I know the character is a bit eccentric however here he was a full blown OCD with non-sense scenes E.g. get the poor 6 year old to run half way across the city to get him eggs then insist on having them be equal in size and cooked for exactly 4 minutes then do it again because the eggs weren't just right... why? that just seemed cruel.E.g. 2. have him stand on the roof of the train in a snowstorm ... just to show the scene, there was no reason for that scene at all. The film gets better as you get past the 'character intro' and onto the actual train however and Poirot is more himself then. Also I'm arab myself and I found the little bits of subtle humor in the first part actually cool and unexpected in an American movie.",6,0,4,11 November 2017
Wonder Woman," It's alright
","The movie is divided into three parts.
First we see Diana as a child then as an adult training to be the best of the amazon warriors. This part is a little weird because when you think amazon warrior you don't think water nymph popping out of the sea to spread the message of LOVE AND PEACE.
Second part Diana goes to London during WWI with a mission of spreading LOVE AND PEACE... by killing Ares the god of war, because obviously we start peace by spilling blood. Thankfully the fish out of water thing is quick and painless.
Third part we are going to war and it's to bring LOVE AND PEACE by killing those on the German side.
As preachy as this movie is it seems like what they're saying and what they're doing contradicts each other.
In the end Gal Gadot is amazing in the role and you always got the sense that Wonder woman was someone larger than life, dignified and with her eyes on the prize. The movie however... well it was a bit on the cheesy side and the final boss battle more funny than dramatic but still it was an alright movie for a rainy day in.",7,1,10,16 February 2020
Black Panther," Beautiful visuals, weak plot
","Visually this movie is beautiful. There are some baffling choices left in. At one point they camera goes upside down trying to copy something similar they did in the last Thor movie. A very, very, very, VERY crappy blue screen effect when they go into the dream state. Those however stuck out because everything else was beautiful and stylized. I liked learning more about such a beautiful city where the old mixes with the new. I don't know how they even sustained it considering they don't trade with the outside so that mcguffin metal they have is just sitting there. Still it was nice to have this be about an entire civilization. They're way of life, politics and views. Not just one guy's journey to the throne.For that I think it's a good movie. It's not a great one however as the plot is flimsy at best and a lot of the scenes and actions make no sense what so ever. Killmonger specifically made zero sense and every scene with him was baffling. The conclusion is also a bit of the let down, it's what would have happened had nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, happened after the first 15 minutes of the movie. You could skip all that and ended up in the exact same place.",7,0,2,1 March 2018
Mother!," Claustrophobic and what the hell!
","When I went to watch the new 'IT' movie there was a trailer for this one showing it to be a ghost / thriller type of movie. it took awhile to get here but I finally went to see it avoiding all other trailers and reviews.... I'm.... confused... Mother is mainly about two characters. Jennifer Lawrence as mother and Javier Bardem as Him. They live in an isolated house in the middle of nowhere when one day a guy visits them. Then things go bonkers with the whole thing from Lawrence's point of view. the people are intrusive, they act as if this was their house not hers. Him also encourages them to take whatever they want saying it's just things and never taking his wife's opinion into consideration... it was weird.The movie is very claustrophobic with the camera zoomed in on Lawrence for the most part that you wished the camera man would just take a few steps back so you could breath. Now I'm not religious so the metaphor I got from this movie (and believe me, there is so much weirdness in there that it could only be a metaphor) was different compared to my friend who sitting right there next to me. The movie is subtle enough that it leaves room for you to make up your own interpretation. just keep in mind that this is not a thriller. the movie you are watching might not be the movie you are seeing.I also want to know what that yellow sand she keeps putting into everything from paint to water. it's the one thing I couldn't figure out with or without the religious interpretation...",5,0,0,21 October 2017
Rear Window," 12 Stars
","10 out of 10 is just not enough for this movie, it deserves more!unlike the 'in your face murder' in his later movie Psycho the possible murder here happens behind a window blind. not a drop of blood or act of violence is seen (well until the reveal) which adds tension to the movie.Jeff's speculations regarding a possible murderer among his neighbors are met with the voice of reason and evidence from his detective friend. Everything is pointing towards this being a wild goose chase and just when he's about to give up on the idea something arouses his suspicion again.Hitchcock is the master of thrill and horror and he will have you wavering between siding with Jeff or with reason throughout the movie, never truly settling on a side for too long. Beautifully shot, smooth editing... and Grace Kelly is her radiant self in it! Truly an under-rated masterpiece that gets over shadowed by his heavier movies but if you want something interesting, re- watchable and in it's own way light hearted then this is the one for you.",10,1,2,12 May 2016
Deadpool," Girly Screams will ALWAYS be funny!
","Short Review :-Take your loved one and see this movie. why even waste time reading a review just go!Long Review *SPOILERS!!*:-This movie is so good it's sinful! The opening scene alone prepares you with a credit role that goes hot chick comic relief Director = overpaid toolall while scrolling over bits and parts of what looks like a freeze frame of an action scene... just for the camera to zoom out and you see it's deadpool giving someone a wedgie out of a car window! Ryan Reynolds as deadpool is pitch perfect as both the the normal mercenary Wade or the anti-hero and his delivery is amazing.the writing is pretty good with the jokes coming at you from unexpected angles and the fourth wall being made of paper. Make no mistake, this is a hard R rated movie, they held NOTHING back! however I'd like to point out that this movie really does have a little bit of everything.you have a comic book hero (or anti-hero really), you have a light seasoning of romance that doesn't feel forced at all, some slice of life and a lot of comedy.They did attempt to throw a moral dilemma in there in the end but by then you'd have taken in the overall atmosphere of the movie and in your head you'd be like 'ehhh shut up and shot already!' which to my glee Deadpool did and called the other character on his monologuing!Is the movie perfect? nope, it's perfectly insane! And I loved it, it was a ton of fun and refreshing change from the usual super-hero genre.",9,1,11,20 February 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," A 2 hour rush!
","This is an action packed movie that truly delivers on it's promise.Come and see monster cars, flaming guitars and hot super models.Then watch them all go BOOOOMMMMM!!!!! in a 2 hour long monster car race in a post apocalyptic desert.This movie makes a great cult classic as there is more to it then meets the eye, Plot is simple and straight forward however the details in this world need more then one viewing to take in, it is truly a world gone insane and unlike many movies this one SHOWS the insanity rather then TELL it, you see it for yourself and if you can wrap your mind around it it'll all start making sense... in this world anyway!If you are into this kind of movies then you will love this continuation of a 30 year Mad Max Dome movie. If you prefer character development and unexpected plot twists you will be deeply disappointed.",6,1,10,30 May 2015
