Sucker Punch," Zack Snyder at the top of his game.
","Whats with all the bashing and negative reviews? It seems like nowadays that the critics are acting up like whiny, sarcastic and unsatisfied customers with a thin trace of patience. Seriously, this movie was ******* awesome! Well...OK, I can agree that this film isn't that great but its sure one hell of a good punch. A punch so strong, it'll knock the senses out of you. Anyways, here is my review:The Storyline: Basically, it's about a girl trying to escape a hospital for the mentally insane (Why females only? I'm guessing this hospital is for girls that are 'crazy?'-and-in-their-early-twenties-with-a-hot-body...hm?) and so she's trying to get other girls to do the same and all they need is a couple of items and they are all set...it sounds easy but it isn't so easy after all. So what does this have to deal with Nazi zombies, fire-breathing dragons, robots, huge-ass samurai warriors, etc? Well, whenever Babydoll (Emily Browning, the girl I was talking about) closes her eyes she imagines an alternative universe that has the same goals and objectives but in different situation. Zack Snyder wants us to see some sort of similarities between the two worlds (reality and fantasy) so what ever is happening in the fantasy world is happening in the real world, mostly involving the characters. Characters are: Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens). Let us not forget about Madame Gorski, 'love your accent by the way' who is played by Carla Gugino. Mr. Blue (Oscar Isaac), who isn't a bad character but when he's acting like a b****, he becomes a *itch and you'll hate him after what he did. The story is (to me) well told and there are moments in which you just gasp in awe and in shock. Female Empowerment: The girls are just trying to play as what the guys in the film are seeing them as, sexy-ass sluts. But I think Zack Snyder is trying to tell us that females can be viewed as sex objects because a lot of people see them that way (reason why they wear tight, barely naked outfits in the real world and also in the fantasy world) but the females just don't see themselves that way and so the fantasy world helps us to see that they are just a band of females trying to survive so they'll do anything to survive. Nuff said. BTW: 'Don't mess with these chicks, they'll kill you.' Visuals: Impressive and well worth my time especially the fantasy world, when the 5 of them are trying to complete each dangerously-crazy missions. Characters: The guys are punks and even though (sometimes) Babydoll looks like she's about to die, she has a moments of 'lets beat the crap out of them.' The girls are dimensional and very serviceable; they laugh, cry, yell and scream (Good one Abbie) so nothing outstanding but...serviceable.Overall, Didn't want to talk too much because it's just a film but the critics hit it hard and I didn't think it was fair for Zack Snyder or for any new directors that make up their own ideas to be assaulted with bad reviews (come on '4 zero stars.'). Anyways, I think Zack Snyder stepped up a notch from his other movies like taking flight with the owls or seeing tight-thong warriors in a bloody battle. This one was just...it blew my mind. I give him credit and just for you guys to know, it ends with a happy but unusual note. I know that Zack Snyder likes to darken his movies and this one was pretty much unnerving (sometimes even depressing).An 8.5",8,3,5,6 July 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Dawn Part 1: Well-Made, Melodrammatic but Mature...
","THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN PART 1 (EXTENDED EDITION) Movie Review: 'After the successful third edition into the series, Eclipse; which has been received with better to positive reviews from major critics and appraisal from an estimated 83,693,746 fans, much expectation was directed towards Academy Award winning Bill Condon. This new director succeeds almost certainly but this soap-operatic film falls in some ways that made Eclipse such a guilty pleasure to watch.' The story continues with Bella Swan finally making the decision to marry and live eternally with her beloved Edward Cullen, with the disapproval of Jacob Black the buff childhood sweet heart, a werewolf as well, whom she dumps for because her love for Edward is unending even though he left her heart broken in New Moon, the second movie/book, causing her to become suicidal such as risking her life to see a faint image of Edward. Bella marries Edward, consumes a half-human, half-vampire child during their honeymoon, deteriorates slowly due to the rapid growth of the baby in which is tearing her apart inside, and the whole Cullen family has to worry about their shaky treaty with the werewolves, the Quileute tribe. All in all, the story sounds a bit more mature than the three previous films because more is at stake and the conflict is more grave than the decision between Bella's love over her two suitors. However, sadly, Breaking Dawn-Part 1 seems to be more in the same veins as New Moon. The film is directed better, the story is grim, the production designs are well made and the actors are marginally better than before, but why does it sometimes feel like a lackluster? The Actors: 1.0 credit They have been swooning and moody for the past three films, especially the central character Bella Swan. I like her character because she represents the average neighborhood girl. Her yearning in Twilight is understandable and relates to many. Her pain in New Moon is sometimes a bore but relatable. She gradually matures in Eclipse. Finally, in Breaking Dawn Part 1, she gets to play a deteriorated mother of an unknown child that could represent danger and the end to her life. The credit goes to Kristen Stewart. This is her better role so far as Bella Swan. We are able to feel her sense of determination and yet see her outward appearance which might shock some viewers. Her high cheek bones, her bony structure, her darken eyes, and her raspy-low voice. Thanks to the designers and visual effects. Edward and Jacob, both, act the usual with Edward moping voice and Jacob's cracked voice. The Visual Effects and Production Values: 1.0 credit Bella's body is something of a disgusting fascination, her performance also adds to the finishing touch; make up and computer detailing. The Wedding Scene in the beginning is well staged and beautifully mossy yet rich, over the top looking. The fight that ensues in the end is watchable but only shortly. Overall, this seems like an expensive soap opera movie. The Ending: 1.0 credit Gruesome Birth scene of a screaming Bella Swan only adds to the horror of what is happening below the stomach. In fact, Rosalie does a risky C-Section while Edward shoots morphine up her arms and legs. Blood is everywhere, which is a difficult situation especially delivering a half-vampire, half human baby in the company of vampires, and the audience can cringe to the sounds of bones crushing, heavy breathing and saliva spitting everywhere from Bella's mouth. We then see a dying Bella lying lifeless on the bed. The camera work and lighting are things that add up to the horror and terrifying 10 minutes experience of Bella giving birth and Edward trying to revive her. This is one of the better scenes I have ever seen in any movie so far about a female character trying to deliver a baby (besides Rosemary's Baby). The ending keeps you at the edge of your seat. Overall. 3/5 Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a better film; in the design, the visual effects, a bravura performance from Kristen Stewart and an engaging first and last 20 minutes. However, it still feels like a complete letdown from Eclipse; the performances from the other characters, the pacing is slow, and the dialogue still remains indifferent. Yet, I hope that the last part of this series will shoot me out with a bang",6,2,8,26 November 2011
Alice in Wonderland," What has Tim Burton been Smoking?
","All the beauty and the hard work in creating Wonderland really pays off especially if seen in 3D. Tim Burton's dark direction of Alice In Wonderland is somewhat interesting, the finishing look looks well made but sometimes its a bit too gloomy and added with the dullness of a story that is all too mature for anybody 10 and under (Go figure: Alice is like in her late teens, more problems). The characters all have their own unique touch; Alice is the low key but she's not a chore to look at, Johnny Depp is as charming as ever (a more crazier take then Jack Sparrow), The Red Queen's big heart shaped head is BIG and Anne Hathaway's White Queen never stops putting her hands in the air. Each character has charm in them but when added with Tim Burton's touch, each of them have their own 'dark side.' Alice seems to be the normal one but the rest like Mad Hatter (his creepy red eyes) and White Queen (when she's not looking at her orchids she's in the kitchen making up a hot potion of fingers and saliva) are all mad but in a good-funny way. Let us not forget about Alan Rickman who plays an ugly-wrinkled caterpillar that only puffs on a cigarette or in a kid's interpretation 'sucking on a perfume looking bottle and blowing out circle clouds.' The whole entire film...lets just say, 'Tim Burton, WHAT on Earth have you've been smoking?' The whole entire film is like on the high ride with Tim Burton which makes the film Mad! I guess its a good thing, whatever he's smoking seems to be working for him and while I was watching this film, I couldn't help but hallucinate as well. The Storyline of the Film: It gets a 60%. It was very simply done and told. It seems like every Disney movie has a theme which this one has. Theme: being brave and mad at the same time which is what I got out of it. I know other people think it's about governing yourself and taking the lead. The C.G.I usage of the Film: It gets an 80% Visually Striking! A movie that gets credits for the visuals. Overall: 70% It's an interesting film made only to catch the audience's eyes but it does little effect to move the heart.",7,1,1,3 July 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises is a fitting conclusion that succeeds mostly...
","'The Dark Knight Rises doesn't nearly rise up to the superiority of its predecessor but it still has tension, stronger emotions and a fitting conclusion to a remarkable trilogy.'So is it possible for something 'GREAT' to be exactly the same again but even better? Almost. The first Batman movie of this trilogy was completely original; it had the audience in a complete shock. It was atmospheric: dark alleys, tattooed train stations, heavy rain pouring on a 'Ghetto' city/district called Gotham. Gotham is where everything is taken place...(coughs) Manhattan. It also introduced us into a world of corruption and injustice (sound at all familiar). In which judges were paid off, drug dealers sold more drugs and the criminals roam freely among the streets. 'Batman Begins' introduced us to Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), Rachel (Katie Holmes), Alfred (Michael Caine), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Ra's Al Ghul (played by 'gotta-watch-the-movie). The whole movie introduced us to Batman, how he became Batman, an evil villain who wants to destroy Gotham City by way of chemical drugs that will make you hallucinate the worst of your fears. 'Batman Begins' was incredible and I thought that Christopher Nolan did an excellent job with the execution. Batman Begins: a Summer flick that has special effects, great performances, terrifying tension and brains. -8.9The Dark Knight was 10x greater than the first. It's not the normal, clean-cut villain with a will, 'want to take over the world.' This Joker (played brilliantly by Heath Ledger) is sick, twisted and psychopathic. He literally defines the word 'evil.' The Dark Knight came out as an unexpected experience because the Joker is a freak and he would blow up anyone and anything, a hospital even. He simply '...has no motive'-Alfred. The Joker can kick any horror villain's ass. He is that complex ('You wanna know how I got these scars?!')and no doubt, he can mind-twist the jigsaw to the point in which Mr. Rosy Cheeks is strapped to a seat with running gasoline and a time bomb. I loved The Dark Knight! The performances were top notch, Mr. Ledger especially. Christian Bale has a good voice but when he turns into the Batman, it sounds...eh. -9.5 *unbelievable score by Hans Zimmer who scored the more tense scenes and James Newton Howard who scored emotional and ethereal tracks. I am a fan for both of their music. So comes the final conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises. The tension still felt like you're having a heart attack, like the other two. The performances are great (Anne Hathaway, I am surprised) until Batman goes, 'WHERES THE TRIGGER?!!!!' The villain however, isn't as great as the Joker because his motives were so obvious. He wanted to destroy Gotham just like Ra's Al Ghul. Banes presence however, is terrifying. It's remarkable how eyes can have so much impact even though his voice can sometimes throw you off (Sean Connery). It's bigger, bolder and has more action (special effects are amazing) but sadly, I wish it were more profound. It's still entertaining but it didn't leave me with a long impression or that 'wow' feeling I got from the second one. It did look like the director had to cut off some scenes due to the time, some scenes didn't match at all. The big battle seemed conventional but I did have a bloody good time watching it. The ending was by far the best endings I've ever seen in the past year (surpasses his earlier work 'Inception'); it was something that The Dark Knight lacked in. However, I do give Christopher Nolan credit for providing a moral to this story which the story traces back to the first film. Overall, I had an awesome premiere-night/morning with family and friends but I felt so depressed about the whole incident in Colorado. May we all pray for the families who lost a loved one in that horrific shooting. -8.7%",8,1,3,23 July 2012
