Deja Vu," Great movie!
","I love movies that make me think. If you like to play around the concept of time, the universe as a bendable blanket, then you will be fascinated by this movie. Really interesting concept.Denzel Washington is best at playing the character as a cop or detective of some sort. He basically traces all the evidences to figure out that there is a way to go back in time to save all the victims. The movie is intense. It keeps you thinking and wondering what on earth is going on. There were a lot of clues given as well throughout the movie. You need to see the movie to understand how intriguing it is. If you have seen movies such as 'Frequency' and liked them, then I think you will like this movie.",10,3,6,25 November 2006
