3:10 to Yuma," The Most Standard and Dull Western Imaginable
","I don't know who wrote the previous 'review' of this film giving it ten stars, but they were either a studio plant or completely insane. '3:10 To Yuma' is absolutely the most by-the- numbers Western you have ever seen. Not a single thing is surprising or original here. It's like a checklist of clich√©s and awful dialogue. Then again, what could we expect from the guy who also brought us the most by-the-numbers biopic, 'Walk The Line'? It's like he's phoning in his entire career.I'm no film buff by any means, but even I have seen a movie or two by Sergio Leone, and I just don't understand how a movie like '3:10 to Yuma' could even be made after that. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale don't even come close to having the charisma of a John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, or even Kevin Costner (from that 'Open Range' movie a few years back). The only spark of anything surprising or enjoyable in this movie is Ben Forster's performance as Russel Crowe's lunatic/quasi-gay sidekick. If you see the movie you'll notice it's him that's on all the posters, not either of the leads... perhaps because he's the only thing worth paying attention to (if you can keep your eyes open.) In conclusion, this movie takes a huge step backward for the entire genre of Western films. What a waste of time.",2,31,191,21 August 2007
