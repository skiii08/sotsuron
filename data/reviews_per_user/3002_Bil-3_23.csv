Requiem for a Dream," **** 1/2 Harrowing, brilliant
","Harrowing, uncompromising look at the world of drug addiction, Darren Aronofsky's sophomoric effort is a masterpiece of visual elegance and hard-edged style that surpasses his witty but self-conscious debut, Pi: here the fast-paced cutting and frenetic energy do get wearing at times, but on the whole the psychotic carnival ride of images is so suited to the subject matter that it makes it all feel appropriate. Ellen Burstyn stars in a career-topping performance as an aging, lonely woman who gets addicted to diet pills when she becomes convinced that she's eligible to be a television game show contestant. Jared Leto is her son, a junkie trying to make it on the streets as a big-time dealer with his best friend (Marlon Wayans), but neither of them can shake their habits long enough to accomplish it. Jennifer Connolly is excellent as Leto's girlfriend, at first a promising young woman from a well-to-do family, but eventually a dope fiend who will really do anything for a hit. Brilliant as it may be, the film pulls no punches and is in no way easy, therefore a warning to sensitive viewers that they might consider thinking about this one before committing to it.",Null,0,0,22 May 2001
Erin Brockovich," ***** Easily Julia's Best Ever
","One of the best films of the year is this excellent biography of the true-life woman who brought about the biggest personal lawsuit case in American legal history. Julia Roberts gives the absolute best performance of anybody's career as Brockovich, a single mother who gets a job working for lawyer Albert Finney and stumbles across records of a case pertaining to nearby town residents who might have been poisoned by an oil corporation's faulty dumping methods. Steven Soderbergh continues his habit of filmmaking excellence, proving that even big-budget crowd-pleasers are not anywhere out of his reach, nor do they have to feel like glossy Hollywood sellouts.",Null,1,2,18 May 2001
Meet the Parents," *** Routine but hilarious
","One of the most successful comedies of the year is this charming little romance about a quirky nurse (Ben Stiller) who is brought to his girlfriend's up-state, upper-class, uptight house in New England to meet her parents. Things seem fine at first, but soon Stiller realizes that the menacing father of the house (Robert DeNiro) really is after his hide. Blythe Danner is lovely as the girl's mother, and Teri Polo (who remembers her from The House of the Spirits as the dead Rosa? I do!) is appropriately luminous as the lucky young lady. Features a hilarious cameo by Owen Wilson as a millionaire who does carpentry on the side to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ.",Null,0,0,18 May 2001
Billy Elliot," **** 1/2 Don't miss this movie!
","Those who are expecting the hilarious comedy in the vein of Four Weddings and a Funeral that is promised on the posters for this film will be severely shocked to see that they have been misled. Shocked, but by no means disappointed. Instead of the bumbling comedy this film could have been, it is instead a beautiful and poignant tale of a young man whose dreams are just too big for the town around him. Billy (an astonishingly good Jamie Bell) lives in Durham (Northern England) and one days finds himself captivated during boxing practice when a girls' ballet class finds itself sharing the same gym his team is using. When he's accidentally invited to dance with the young ladies, he finds himself unable to suppress his desire to release all the power inside him through his newfound ability to dance extremely well. Julie Walters is excellent as the teacher who guides him through his burgeoning self-discovery, a role that showcases her on this side of the ocean than any since her starmaking role in Lewis Gilbert's Educating Rita. Gary Lewis is equally brilliant as the ex-boxing champion father, now a miner on strike, who just can't understand the new direction his son has taken him. The film is gorgeously lush, rich with real emotions and endearing characters, fantastic choreography and always manages to be touching without ever resorting to sentimental treacle. Sort of a companion to this year's Dancer In The Dark (though by no means as upsetting): that film showed how music can be the very beat of a person's heart, while here it is the liberation of dance that does the same. Don't miss it!",Null,0,0,28 March 2001
Chicken Run," **** 1/2 Simply amazing!
","Hilarious claymation film from the creator of the always wonderful Wallace and Gromit series, Nick Park. In his first feature film (which took seven years to develop), Park takes us into the world of a chicken coop, where pensive hens lay in wait until they can escape the harsh reality that surrounds them: their farmer owners are planning to be bake them into pies. Julia Sawalha is excellent as the voice of Ginger, the lead chicken who decides to lead the exodus. Mel Gibson lends a bit of American marketing help as the voice of the handsome Rocky, a rooster who supposedly can fly. The best animated film of the year.",Null,0,0,28 March 2001
L.A. Confidential," ***** Best Film of the 90s
","Hands-down my favourite American film of the nineties. Curtis Hanson shocked the world by proving to be not only a great director but an auteur with this unbeatable adaptation of James Ellroy's terrifying novel about corruption and crime among members of the LAPD in the 1950s. The hard-boiled detective story angle is brought to life so beautifully, mostly because Jeannine Claudia Oppewall's production design recreates the dark underside of the 50s to such perfection that not even a Coke bottle label is missed. Add to that Dante Spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artistic and believable comfortably (as all period camerawork should), Ruth Myers' costume designing and a script by Hanson and The Postman scribe Brian Helgeland (I know, I don't get it either) that pares down Ellroy's mammoth plot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman with suspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or the spiderweb of events involved with it, and you have the best movie of 1997, not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. The cast is all brilliant, most notably Kim Basinger as a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind of steel--Basinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll find yourself forgetting she's even acting--and Kevin Spacey as a Dean Martin-esque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle, he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits. I just can't get enough of this film.",10,114,160,17 February 2000
The Beach," *** Dumb but atmospheric
","Another film that took a beating from the critics but wasn't really all that bad. It has gorgeous cinematography of exotic locations and has what is probably the best soundtrack for a film that I have ever owned. What it has going against it is a cast of sniveling little teenagers who think that acting like hippies and smoking reefer on a beach that never ends is the equivalent to living a free-spirited life away from the concerns of a terrifying modern world. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young twenty-something with nowhere to go in life who while on vacation in Thailand hooks up with two French tourists (Guillaume Canet, Virginie Ledoyen) and together they follow a treasure map given to him by the crazed man in the next hotel room (cameo by Robert Carlyle). Where the map takes them is a pure, gorgeous stretch of beach inhabited by the aforementioned hedonists who watched too many Brady Bunch episodes as children and just can't let them go. Since the destruction of this paradise is obvious from the beginning, every cast member's surprise at how things turn out is really annoying. Leo does alright though, and Virginie Ledoyen is quite lovely, but the standout in the cast is British actress Tilda Swinton, here starring in one of her first major studio films. Unfortunately for this film's box-office failure, it will be a while before mainstream American audiences get to know her, but I'm sure with her immense talent and beauty it will happen soon.",Null,4,8,27 March 2001
Cast Away," *** 1/2 Needs a middle
","Tom Hanks' amazing performance is the best reason to watch this excellent drama directed by Robert Zemeckis. The second of two films Zemeckis made in the year 2000 (the other being What Lies Beneath) this is definitely not the superior of the two but is still a worthwhile tale of a Federal Express supervisor stranded on a deserted island for four years after his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Helen Hunt plays the devoted girlfriend who doesn't know to wait for him back home. The film is painfully missing a middle, so once the scenes of isolation are (quickly) over, one is led to believe that Hanks' readjustment to the so-called normal society back home is really the heart of the story. Sadly, this aspect of the plot is also underdeveloped, leaving a good movie that doesn't quite know what it's about.",Null,0,0,28 March 2001
Pitch Black," *** Thrilling and original sci-fi
","Terrifying futuristic thriller about a prison-shuttle ship marooned on a distant planet inhabited by killer creatures that only come out at night. So you only have to worry about the sun going down once a day right? WRONG! A solar eclipse is coming along to shroud the entire planet in darkness for who knows how long, and it's up to the ship's crew led by Radha Mitchell and powerful convict Vin Diesel to keep everyone safe. Plot elements from the Alien movies are liberally borrowed here, but the film is so genuinely terrifying and the production design so convincing (shot in the deserts of Australia which enhances a truly alienating look) that no matter how far ahead you can see in the movie you'll still be thrown for a loop.",Null,0,0,22 May 2001
American Psycho," ** Boring and pretentious
","Dull as anything could possibly be. Eighties materialism, psycho fascination and American sexual frustration of all kinds have been dealt with many times before this and in many, MANY better ways. Mary Harron's latest does, however, have Christian Bale's dead-on performance as Bret Easton Ellis' titular hero/villain and some nifty production design, not to mention a terrifyingly good performance by Samantha Mathis as a dope fiend who provides Bale with a regular friend-it's probably her best performance ever. The film caused much controversy involving activists and censors for its graphic violence and glorification of serial killers, but in the end it was all much ado about nothing: there isn't enough resembling humanity to be offensive, and it's all undone by an ending that renders the entire film completely invalid.",Null,2,3,27 March 2001
American Beauty," Stupendous film debut
","Stupendous film debut from theatrical director Sam Mendes ('Cabaret', 'The Blue Room') that's a must-see for anyone who enjoyed Ang Lee's 'The Ice Storm'. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are at the head of a small family who it appears are coming apart at the seams: Bening's real-estate business can't seem to do as well as 'real-estate king' Peter Gallagher, and Spacey hates his job so much he's willing to quit and work flipping burgers at a fast-food joint. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch, in an amazingly mature performance) has to deal with insecurity and self-doubt in the face of her gorgeous model-hopeful best friend (Mena Suvari), plus figure out what to do with the intense neighbour (Wes Bentley) who seems to be obsessed with her; Bentley has his own plot on the side dealing with his military-obsessed father (a terrifying Chris Cooper) and his positively vacant mother (Allison Janney). Mendes' switch to film was the perfect thing to do; he seems to have no difficulties in understanding the medium, layering the film with incredible subtext and getting his actors to underplay over-the-top roles. Spacey absolutely shines as a man breaking free of a suburban nightmare and trying to really find the 'beauty' in life, as does the ever-beautiful Bening, who seems to grow more fascinating as the years go by. Thomas Newman's unsettling score is one of the film's greatest assets of this, one of the very best films of the year.",Null,0,0,17 February 2000
Remember the Titans," **** Great football film
","What do you get when you mix manipulative comedy-drama that plays its historical backdrop of racial intolerance in 1970s Virginia too broadly with the slam-bang ridiculous action style of movies from the producing efforts of Jerry Bruckheimer? Not to mention a anti-airtight script that wanders around looking for a backbone! Thoroughly satisfying entertainment, is what I say! Sure it's intentions are obvious from the start (as is the playing out of its climactic ending), but for two hours Bruckheimer and director Boaz Yakin keep you busy enjoying all the talent involved in making this movie about how you gotta have heart to win. And all that jazz.
Denzel Washington gives his first warmhearted performance as a true-life football coach assigned to a newly-integrated school who has enough troubles with trying to get his team to get along with each other, let alone win some games, let alone win a seasonal championship, let alone resist the volatile intolerance and bigotry that surrounds the school's new political plateau. Despite its predictable nature the film truly is a deserving crowd-pleaser and features some young actors at the peak of their ensemble-hearted form, most notably Ryan Hurst as Team Captain Bertier, Kip Pardue as the native Californian who rocks the whole team, black and white, with his hippy-ness and the very funny Donald Faison (Clueless's Murray) as Petey, the guy who thinks (much to the coach's detrement) that football is FUN. Hayden Panettiere is a scream (and the best performer in the whole film!) as Coach Yoast's (Will Patton) pint-sized daughter, who has her own ideas about how to run a real football team.",Null,0,0,22 May 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," **** 1/2 Breathtaking!
","Ang Lee has compared this film to an Asian version of his own Sense and Sensibility. Well, yes and no: the film is rich and visually splendid, and the story's structure closely follows the adaptation of Jane Austen's premier novel, but Lee's latest lacks the character depth and heartfelt sentiment that Emma Thompson infused her Sense screenplay with. On top of that, one of Crouching Tiger's main characters (Zhang Ziyi) is a woman devoid of any loyalty and therefore likeability. However, this film has much to recommend it, mostly awe-inspiring martial arts sequences that complement the excellent direction and drama very well. Peter Pau's cinematography is gorgeous and Tim Yip's production and costume design are first rate.",9,0,0,16 May 2001
Coyote Ugly," ** Idiotic, but what great hair!
","A good soundtrack and excellent hair design will never hide the fact that this film is less scholarly than a Playmate of the Month video. For the guys in the audience, it's also less, shall we say, `rewarding' than preview advertisements might promise. Piper Perabo hardly carries the film in the lead role of a young girl who moves from her tiny New Jersey town to the Big Apple in search of her dream of becoming a pop songwriter. The plot device of her songwriting dreams allows the filmmakers to let LeeAnn Rimes dub Perabo's voice (badly) to the tune of Diane Warren's (sometimes good) songs, and then actually bring Rimes into the film in the last five minutes (our girl made it! She's now writing for the girl she mysteriously sounds exactly like!). Perabo's deliciously pretty with a great smile, but her acting is wobbly and kills a lot of credibility for the film. Supporting cast, particularly Maria Pitillo, do much for the film, but in the end the word `Inane' kept rattling through my head.",Null,0,1,28 March 2001
Mission: Impossible II," *** Exciting but not as good as the original
","Tom Cruise is still the world's greatest movie star as he proves in this adrenaline-soaked sequel to his 1996 summer blockbuster. This time the film is shorter on brains and longer on excitement, making it pretty much just as good as the original but on its own terms. Where the first was craftier and better at paying tribute to international spy thrillers of the sixties, this time director John Woo has applied the breakneck speed action of his own Hong Kong thrillers to the proceedings, throwing in ridiculous car chases, motorcycle chases, helicopter chases and who knows what else. Thandie Newton is lovely as the `girl', and Anthony Hopkins makes a welcome cameo as Cruise's mission director.",Null,0,0,18 May 2001
The Insider," ***** Gripping and brilliant
","Gripping true-life account of tobacco industry insider Jeffrey Wigand's experience exposing faulty practices at the large tobacco firm he once worked for, and the ordeal it took to get his interview broadcast on 60 Minutes. Al Pacino is in better shape than he's been in years as Lowell Bergman, the show's hard-working producer who fights as hard as he can to keep his informant protected, and Christopher Plummer is a sizzler as 60 Minutes' chief interviewer Mike Wallace, the man who interviewed Wigand for the program. Director Michael Mann's tyrannical perfectionism has once again paid off and created a fascinating, complex and extremely well-rounded narrative that is helped further along by excellent editing and a first-rate script (which Mann co-wrote with Academy Award-winner Eric Roth) that never descends into character stereotypes or mawkish dialogue. Russell Crowe pretty much steals the show as Wigand, a moral man caught in extremely immoral circumstances who risks losing everything for the sake of telling the truth, much to his wife's (Diane Venora) continued misery. A very American story.",Null,0,0,17 February 2000
All Quiet on the Western Front," ***** Important War movie
","One of the most important war films ever made is this excellent adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's fine novel, directed by Lewis Milestone. A group of eager German students enlist for service in World War I, heedless of warnings from their professors and families. These guys are just itching to be heroes, and the army propaganda has promised them that they will be. The cinematic ballet of war scenes is unlike anything cinema had seen before, and the realism of war in this film is completely at odds with the candy-coloured beauty of propaganda films made a decade later. To make sure World War II hopeful soldiers wouldn't be deterred by the gruesome images seen here, this film was banned in America not only for its pacifism but also because it presented German soldiers as sympathetic protagonists.",Null,1,2,27 March 2001
Bring It On," **** Best teen movie of the year!
","Probably the best teen movie I've seen this year is this bitingly funny and really fun romp about competing cheerleader squads. The actors are all great (Eliza Dushku standing out the most), the choreography is bouncy and the film doesn't end at a prom! Actually, just that is enough to make me love it. Kirsten Dunst stars (and gives a very charming performance) as a suburban high-schooler who has recently been promoted to the captain of the school's cheerleading squad. Working towards winning a national cheerleading championship, she finds out that her predecessor was stealing the group's moves from a highly superior big-city high school team. Dunst has to build the team back up from scratch, something difficult considering both how lowly cheerleading is regarded at her school (not to mention the actual football team they cheer, which hasn't won a game in what seems like a century), and just how the angry the opposing team when they find out that their moves have been copped. Great musical numbers and a good time to be had by all.",Null,0,0,28 March 2001
Ben-Hur," **** Gorgeously junky
","Gorgeously junky' I believe is how uncredited screenwriter Gore Vidal described this pseudo-Bible epic, and no truer word could possibly be said. Everything about the expansive screen version of Gen. Lew Wallace's novel is as loud as it can be-no expense was spared anywhere (I'm sure even the water that flowed over the falls in the picture garden was imported from a spring in Switzerland). What you get when you watch it now is an impressive but weighty and tiring story that really only needs about an hour and a half to tell it fully. Charlton Heston plays the title character, a mistreated Jewish nobleman who goes to prison for something he didn't do, but finds redemption in the end at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Lots of jolly performances all around, but the first half's high adventure spirit seems at odds with the second half's higher concentration on preaching. The most fun to be had is in watching Stephen Boyd as Massala overplay Vidal's added subtheme of Ben-Hur and Massala having been lovers in their youth, plus the totally thrilling chariot race which is everything you've heard about it and more (not to mention a masterpiece of editing). Haya Harareet is above average as the love interest, but give me Elizabeth Taylor and her eyeliner in Cleopatra any day; even though that clunky epic feels like it goes one for seven days non-stop, it's somehow more enjoyable because unlike Ben-Hur it seems to be aware of how ridiculous it is.",Null,4,11,28 March 2001
The Replacements," ** Horrible football film
","Fairly funny film that clunks along from scene to scene, never building up any comedic momentum but nonetheless manages to be humorous sometimes. Mostly the film is weighed down by Keanu Reeves' dull performance as a scab football player during a professional players' strike and Gene Hackman's tired bit as the coach who thinks he's seen it all. Nothing inspired ever happens, even the football scenes aren't very exciting, and then the film ends up with a finale about professionals and their love of money over the game that is so out of place and oh-so-self-righteous in a bad way that I wanted to slap the writer. Brooke Langton makes a sparkling star debut as Reeves' love interest, standing out from a cast of known character actors like Orlando Jones and Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill) who are basically riffing off the personas we know them already for.",Null,3,7,22 May 2001
Gladiator," **** 1/2 Excellent return to sword-and-sandal epics
","Ridley Scott's best film in years is this astonishing epic of Roman proportions about a great general (Russell Crowe) who is demoted to gladiator slave when the kindhearted emperor (Richard Harris) dies and his selfish and callous son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes over. The plot moves smoothly over its vast size without stopping for a second, climaxing in excellent fight scenes that combine state of the art sound effects with Scott's unbeatable visual flair. Crowe gives a star making performance as the lead, and Connie Nielsen stands out in a pretty ineffective role as the princess who must watch her brother destroy everything her beloved father worked so hard for. One of the most exciting films of the year.",9,0,0,18 May 2001
Contact," **** Great science-fiction with a message
","One of my favourite ways to spend two and a half hours is to watch this excellent film over and over again. I can't remember any science-fiction film after 2001: A Space Odyssey to be this thought-provoking, and while Contact is not quite as profound a statement as the aforementioned opus, it still has quite a lot to say for itself. Jodie Foster plays an earnest scientist who spends her whole life searching for extra-terrestrial life and finds vindication when a message is received from outer space. Naturally, it throws the world into a huge frenzy, and despite the efforts of kitschy bad guy Tom Skerritt and military operations-head James Woods, she gets to go on a journey to the heart of the universe and see whether or not she can find the answers she's looking for.",Null,0,2,28 March 2001
High Fidelity," **** 1/2 Bitter romance is best entertainment!
","Excellent relationship comedy that uses the best of the music from the eighties as backdrop to John Cusack narrating his worst breakups. Cusack, who also co-wrote the script based on the book by Nick Hornby, is at his sleepy best as the record store owner who can't seem to get wise to what the women around him want from him. Jack Black is hysterical as the acid-mouthed employee at the store, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lily Taylor and Iben Hjejle are also very memorable as some of the women in his life.",Null,0,1,18 May 2001
