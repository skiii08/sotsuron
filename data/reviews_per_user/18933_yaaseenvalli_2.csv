It," Hey Georgie!
",Man this movie was awesome. It wasn't the kind of horror film you normally see no0wadays that involves children being terrified and portrayed as weaklings but rather showed how a team of kids can unite and stick it to the man.Definitely recommend! one of the best horrors I have seen in ages that didn't involve demons and spirits etc.,9,4,10,9 September 2017
A Quiet Place," Quiet please, this isn't worth it!
","I went to see this tonight with high expectations of it being one of the best horror movies so far this year, and boy was I left dissapaomted.
It wasn't all bad though, started off really well and sets the tone for the movie nicely, however, without giving too much away about the movie, you just think to yourself after it is finished 'what was even the point of all this'? A huge let down in my opinion.",3,11,23,8 April 2018
