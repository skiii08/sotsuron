Hereditary," Trailer completely fooled me
","If you're anything like me and you like horror movies to be a little more traditional, but still very good (like The Conjuring and Insidious) - don't see this. The trailer paints it as such a movie, but's to me it's really weird, way too artistic and boring. I really like the premise, but hated the excecution. It's like the movie wants to be as weird as it can be. A shame",4,2,4,19 July 2018
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Exactly what I wanted and more!
","I already had high expectations to this due to the casting and because I love Eurovision, and my expectations were met 100%. Everything about Eurovision was SO Eurovision, down to every single detail. And on top of that, the film was exciting, moving and funny. McAdams especially did it for me, she gave everything to her character. A must-see for everyone that loves Eurovision or loves to hate it",9,3,5,28 June 2020
