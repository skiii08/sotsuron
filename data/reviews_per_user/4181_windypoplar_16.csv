Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a supremely entertaining prequel
","Episode 1-the phantom menace is much more Flash Gordon and serialized than Star Wars fans might have expected, unlike 4-6, this film is lots of exposition and character introductions. If seen with all the pre-conceived ideas and 'this isn't how I thought it would be' bull its not great, if viewed on its own merit, I think Phantom Menace is one of the best films ever.Our story starts with two Jedi sent to investigate the increasingly malicious acts of the Trade Federation. Qui-Gon and Ob-wan Kenobi, (hmm, he seems familiar) they're are ambushed and they both realize the young queen of the Naboo is in trouble. They rescue Amidala with the help of a Gungan named Jar Jar Binks, one of the most fully-realized animated characters ever. They end up on the barren two-suns world of Tattooine. Here they meet little Anakin Skywalker, who feels he should help them, he's also blown away by the beautiful handmaiden of the Queen, Padme. The only way they can get off Tattoine is by winning a high-speed pod race, with Anakin driving. The pod-race, a tribute to 'Ben-Hur's chariot race, is terrific, visually and sound wise.Pursued by the ultra-scary Darth Maul, our heroes go to Coruscant, central system of the Galactic Republic, here Amidala will plead her case to the Senate, headed by Supreme Chancellor Valorum, played by stage vet Terence Stamp. They are aided by Senator Palpatine, who is unusually interested in their plight.Sadly the Senate does nothing, though the scene is terrific FX, watch for cameos by E.T.!!! Amidala decides she must stop being reactive and pacifist and save her suffering people who are being held by the droid army of the federation. Qui-Gon, played brilliantly as a man full of regret by Liam Neeson, believes that Anakin maybe e the one, the one to restore balance to the Force. He also believes DArth Maul to a be a Sith. Neither Yoda or Mace Windu, played by the always welcome Sam Jackson, believe him, they are too confident in their power.Our heroes are up against it on NAboo and Amidala seeks help form the Gungans. Their leader Boss Nass is suspicious but Jar Jar and Padme's confession that she is really Amidala, queen of the NAboo, convince him of their sincerity. Dorids R2-D2 and C-3po help out and they conceive of a plan to deactivate the droid army. 'A well-conceived plan, however there's great risk.'-Qui-gon. 'That is why we must not fail to get the viceroy, everything depends on it.'-Padme.The battle for Naboo is played out like Spartacus against the Romans and its epic in scope and power. Even Anakin helps out with R2 and knocks the droid control ship out of the stars. But Darth Maul, under command of a mysterious Sith, confronts Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon! A terrific Duel of the fates takes place and Qui-Gon is killed. Obi-Wan vanquishes Maul, but must promise to train Anakin in the ways of the Force, something he is strangely reluctant to do.Our heroes are honored by PAdme in a great Naboo ceremony, Qui-Gon is said goodbye to but both Yoda and Mace feel the danger is far from over. Absolutely great with a complex political plot, dangerously good FX and super performances. Natalie Portman is the only actress who could play Luke and LEia's mother and she does it so well! The age of Anakin, could a ten-year old really pull this off? And the timeline in relation to IV are the only quibbles with a great movie.",9,1,2,21 January 2008
Alexander," Alexander the great?
","A historical epic like Oliver Stone's 'Alexander', depends on its lead actor. Colin Farrel was just a complete mistake! His Irish accent, too obviously bleached blonde hair, it really killed the film. Angelina Jolie, one of my favourite actresses, fares no better, why on earth does she sound like a Russian countess! The film has its moments, but the miscasting brings it down.The entry into Bablyon is magnificent and the last battle in India is right up there with Stone's best stuff, but it cannot make up for the terrible acting of the leads. Only Val Kilmer came off well here. Vangelis' score is evocative and moving and the photography is first rate. Why after seeing the dailies didn't Stone realize how wrong Farrel and Jolie were? He has enough clout to recast his movie even once its in production. A real shame as Alexander is a fascinating figure. Even the slow-moving '55 version with Richard Burton is better entertainment than this. The cast just bombs out here, even Rosario Dawson, usually excellent, is supporting a mysterious accent that makes her unintelligible. The best acting was done by Alexander's horse Bucephaelus! A real shame, don't torture yourself, rent 'Troy' instead.",4,5,7,18 August 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," awesome!
","I didn't check this out in the theaters, dummy me! This was really good, after part two, which I found disappointing, I wasn't sure about 'At World's End', boy did they do great! OK, the embarrassing cameo by Keith Richards was pretty awful, but other than that this was a great pirates movie!To pick up Captain Jack Sparrow is lost in Davy Jones' locker and its up to Barbosa, Elizabeth and Will to rescue him, this is handled well as they travel to Singapore to enlist help from Chow Yun-Fat. Cool sets, the movie didn't stint on the seedy feel of southeast Asia and some of the humor was spot-on here! After Jack's rescue they journey to Pirate's Cove on Shipwreck island for a final showdown with the English, Davy Jones, et al. The effects are marvelous and the action first-rate. Johnny was terrific, even though we've seen this trick performance before it was still fun. Keira Knightley never looked lovelier and Bill Nighy managed to give some heart to the squid-faced Davy Jones, no easy feat. There were plenty of plot twists and surprises and the movie moved well considering its 3 hours long!Please note they didn't take the easy way out with Will Turner and his doomed Dad Bootstrap Bill. This was heart-breaking but very good and totally in character for Jack. Stay tuned after the credits for a lovely final scene with Will and Elizabeth. This was excellent and well done. I'll probably buy this one, it was fun from start to finish!",7,0,2,1 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," the climax of the greatest space saga ever
","Star Wars episode 6-Return of the Jedi is the last of an original nine part story. Producer Gary Kurtz left the series when George Lucas decided to wrap up the story in six films, originally three. Franky I don't think Jedi could be any better. Out story starts where five left off, they have to rescue Han from the slimy Jabba. A well-handled if slightly silly Jabba's Palace does feature princess Leia at her sexiest, in fact its about as sexy as Star Wars gets. Once Han is saved its off to the plot, Luke has accepted that Darth is his father once a dying Yoda confirms it. Hamill (Luke) is so good in these scenes that it still amazes me, Yoda's death is just so sad! And Yoda tells him there is another Skywalker, he's not alone! Luke uses the force to divine that Leia is his sister. Still how to tell her, and obviously reveal to her that Vader is her father too, is delicate to do. Luke, Han and the rest of the rebels hook up on Endor to take out the Emperor once and for all. He is building a new Death star and the galaxy will not be safe till this dark lord of the Sith is dead. But to do that Luke must kill Vader. It's something he cannot do. On Endor we are introduce to fuzzy, cuddly Ewoks, lovable teddy bears who make up in courage what they lack in size. I loved the Ewoks, Wickett was just great! It sup to Han and Laie, no rather deeply in love, to clear the way for the assault on the Death Star. In the lovely tree top village of the Ewoks Luke tells Leia the truth, Darth is their father, she his sister and he must try to bring Vader back to the good side of the Force. This is the great theme of Star WArs and most fantasy, Good redeems its own, evil turns upon itself.Aboard the Death STar, Luke tries to find the good left in his Father, even Obi-Wan thinks its too late. 'He's more machine than man now, twisted and evil' But Luke knows he was Annakin Skywalker, a great Jedi and only the evil of the Emperor Palpatine has turned him cold. The final battle between Luke and Darth is epic and emotional and only Luke's refusal to give in to the dark side, so well personified by Ian MacDiarmid as Palpatine, his eyes glow red!, gives Darth the strength to save his son and kill the Sith. Wowza! Of course Han has succeeded too and the Death STar is about to blow, Luke is trying to save his battered and dying Father when in one of the most tearful scenes ever for me, DArth says, 'Its too late for me, my son. Luke, help me take this mask off.' Luke-'but you'll die' 'Nothing can stop that now, just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes.' 'Luke, tell your sister you were right, you were right about me.' 'I'll not leave you here I've got to save you!' 'You already have my son' If you don't cry your'e legally dead. Luke gets Annakin's body off and then in a the old Jedi way, for Luke is a Jedi now, like his father before him, he cremates Darth as the galaxy celebrates the death of the Emperor. John Williams original score for this film was great, the celebratory final scene is a fitting cap to the six films and I loved seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and Annakin reunited in the Force, Luke sees them and winks, its like a wink to the audience too, we did it! Good triumphed and evil is gone. Jedi is a great flick with characters we've all come to love. Well worth watching again and again.",9,0,1,21 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," forbidden love, mystery and the clone wars begin...
","Star Wars, episode 2, will always be the runt of the star wars pantheon, its basically a bridge between 1 & 3, still it has its moments.Ten years after the Phantom Menace, Anakin is Ob-Wan's headstrong apprentice, a new threat to Padme reunites our heroes. Anakin has never forgotten PAdme, he's in love with her, though that is forbidden to Jedi. She doesn't see him as a man yet, and is more concerned with the depraved bureaucracy she sees. While Obi-Wan goes to investigate the Separatist movement, Anakin is assigned to protect PAdme along with the loyal droid C-3po. They go to her homeworld of Naboo and naturally fall in love.Obi-Wan goes to Kamino and finds clones being made for use by the Republic, curious and curiouser. Obi-Wan begins to smell a rat amount the senators. He goes to Geonosis but is captured by the smooth-talking Count Dooku, played to the hilt by the grand old wizard himself, Christopher Lee. Anakin and PAdme go to Tattoine to rescue Anakin's mother, but its too late. Consumed by grief and hatred Anakin is slipping towards the dark side, but he's still loyal to Obi-Wan and goes to rescue him.They are all captured and nearly killed by monsters in the arena, but the Jedi fly to the rescue led by Mace and Yoda and the clones!! A terrific final battle between Yoda and Count Dooku is one of the best lightsabre duels in history. For those who question this, note Yoda's lightsaber in Episode 5. Anakin loses his arm, but gains Padme, she marries him in secret on Naboo and the fate of the Galaxy is sealed as Palpatine becomes supreme chancellor of the Senate.Marred by an overly long speeder pursuit through Coruscant and a unneeded droid factory sequence, Episode two falls short of the other films, but the John Williams sweeping, romantic score, 'Across the Stars' and the excellent FX, make this a winner.",8,2,2,21 January 2008
The Village," weird and involving, but what was the point?
","First off let me state that I thought this was a very unfairly criticized film. It's actually quite good. The pacing, acting (more on that shortly), and atmosphere were excellent. As social commentary, the film is fine, ranking with the best films of this short decade.It is rife with problems though. Firt off Bryce Dallas Howard is simply awful in every scene. Has anyone ever seen a worse portrayal of a blind person? Justine Bateman was ten times more believable in a TV-movie! She simply doesn't register at all with me. Sort of like Particia Arquette, who is much better on television. The look of the film is great. It invades you with dread and misgivings. William Hurt is so into his part here it hard to understand him at times. Much like I would think a 19th century person would be to us. Sigourney Weaver is good, but underused. Adrien Brody reminds you why he won an Oscar, and will win more. Joaquin Phoenix is great, as always, but why does he play three different roles here? Did I miss something? The 'twist' in the village, I wont reveal it all but... Is good, just a bit unrealistic. Sort of like the old Twilight Zone where Roddy McDowall ends up in the zoo. Okay, but not exactly true to life. The reason for the village is good, but lets face it, utopias don't work. Endowing this one with its own myths was a good idea though and works very well with Brody's character. Overall I thought the film was OK, just not as good as it should have been, with such a talented cast. It haunts you, but leaves too many holes to be really satisfying.",5,0,0,3 November 2006
Transformers," more than meets the eye
","Again a great movie I missed till it came to DVD. Sigh. Tranformers, re-imagined by director Michael Bay, is loud, funny and fast. Its a perfect popcorn movie and a real feast for the eyes. And no, I don't just mean Megan Fox. The effects in the movie are some of the best I've ever seen, truly good and utterly convincing. Of course the characters reactions aren't always so real, but hey its a summer movie.For anyone unfamiliar with the toys from Hasbro or the ludicrously popular cartoon from the 80's, this is probably confusing. Hence Optimus Prime delivers the prologue himself. Very cool, even cooler its still Peter Cullen doing the voice. Kudos to the film's makers for that. I did miss Starscream and Megatron but I think those performers might be dead. Hugo Weaving did a nice job as Megatron.Shia Lebouef, awful name but nice kid, does well as Sam, he really carries the film at times. Megan Fox is the love interest here and I take umbrage with any complaints about her acting, you try acting in a piece like this! She was smoking hot and very convincing to me. So there. To those who said there was no plot or development, did you actually watch this movie? C'mon, Mikhala is pretty shallow till she meets Sam and she proves her mettle by hanging with him in this crazy situation. Remember the line, 'get in the car'? She did, remember that.Optimus looks great and the Bumblebee Camaro is awesome. I love the in-jokes, especially the one about 'Armageddon' this movie had me laughing and cheering, just like a popcorn movie should! My only complaint was I thought the final battle was slightly off, not bad, just should have been bigger, less stupid extras and more demolition. Other than that it was great. Oh, one other complaint, other than the great old songs used by Bumblebee in the beginning of the film, lousy music score, oh well. Still a great flick.",7,0,2,1 January 2008
Black Snake Moan," Fantastic! 'Suffa' this and you won't be sorry!
","Black Snake Moan came and went kind of fast at the theaters, so I wasn't sure what to expect. WOW! This is one terrific movie! I honestly don't think it could be much better, and for me thats saying something. I'm really not familiar with Craig Brewer, did see 'Hustle and Flow', but he is something to have written and directed something this cool.Sam Jackson is often called the 'Coolest MF on the planet' he proves it here. He is just superb as a wounded blues-man. Christina Ricci is also excellent as a out-of-control nymphomaniac. And even Justin Timberlake (!), is fine.The story is bound to be judged by some as misogynistic and silly, but I found it riveting. Who knew Sam Jackson could sing? He does a fine job. Christina as Rae, just hits all the right notes, I've seldom seen an actress with more guts, she spends most of this film in her underwear! She just perfectly portrays a girl who can't help it.There are loads of powerful scenes in this-Laz playing to Rae during the thunderstorm, Lincoln coming to find Rae chained to Laz's radiator. There's plenty of faith and good humor here. It is graphic, this is not for children, and I did have a slight problem with the Blues club scene, the language and primal cane seemed a bit at odds with the cathartic stuff Laz tried to save Rae with before. In fact my only complaint in this is the pervasive profanity. If you talk filth all the time isn't it in you? But that aside its great. The last scene in particular, after the wedding, is an extremely important and well-acted closer and both Ricci and Timberlake do very well. It's the type of closure you don't expect in Southern Gothic like this. Awesome movie. See it!",8,1,4,3 July 2007
Blood Diamond," a truly moving picture
","My friends kept telling me how good this was, so I finally checked it out. This was really good. It concerns Sierra Leone in a time of unrest and the illegal export of diamonds. One very rare pink diamond, the blood diamond of the title, is the catalyst that brings a smuggler, a local, and a reporter together.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a terrific performance in this, is there a better actor in the world under forty? DIjimon Hounsou is equally impressive and Jennifer Connelly, looking great as she did in the old days, is good to. The move is not usually my type of thing and it is very violent. However thats probably necessary in a film like this. Director Ed Zwick (Legends of the Fall, Glory) keeps things moving fairly well and the film manages to make you think and care about he people. No easy feat, the characters, with the exception of Solomon (Hounsou) are out for themselves. Also in this cynical age it takes some creative dialog to get to you. Blood Diamond accomplishes this quite well.The film delivers a powerful message without being preachy and the film deserved the accolades it received. kudos to all involved, a great film.",8,2,2,19 June 2007
The Fountain," wow, that was pointless.
","The Fountain, with Hugh Jackman and Rachel Wiez sounded great to me, a film of depth and poignancy, Unforntunately, one had to actually watch it. Sigh. Sure the cinematic tricks are impressive and Jackman tries really hard, but the film is overwrought and stupefying. There aren't really three parallel stories here, just one Tommy and Izzy, with silly flashbacks and flashforwards to a tree in the stars. A great cast is wasted and given little to do. Dr. Tommy Creo is a research doctor trying to save his dying wife, cancer is never actually named. She has written something called the 'fountain' and while that sounds intriguing, nothing ever comes of it. Scenes play, repeat and end with no purpose and the viewer, at least this one, wishes they'd get on with it.'The Fountain' purports to bring up the grand questions of life, death and immortality, but doesn't offer the answers or even reasonable suggestions. The scene in which Tommy turns into a tree is good and at the end he buries an itchy ball in Izzy's grave. Yep, thats it. If you really want something adult and thought provoking try 'Solaris' with George Clooney, that was adult, meaningful and moving, without being depressing and repetitive and dull. There is no story of conquistadors's here, no matter what the cover says, nor is there any glimpse into the future, even the story, set in 2000, might as well be anytime. Experimental film like this is difficult and needs careful execution and a satisfying end. This has neither. Save yourself and don't watch. Seriously, read a book or better still rent 'Solaris' or 'Heavy Metal 2000' this drivel belongs with the wretched 'What Dreams May Come' or something of that ilk. Yuck!",3,2,5,24 July 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," terrific, sensual , entertainment
","Where to start. This is one of my all-time favourite movies, horror or otherwise. Coppola does a fantastic job of brining Stoker's story back to the Victorian era. The sets are lavish, the costuming and photography excellent. Kilar's core is simply haunting, breathtaking in spots, it stays in your head forever.What I really loved about this though was the acting. Oldman is great actor and he simply becomes Vlad Drakul. Amazing stuff. Hopkins Van Helsing is a bit punchy, but that suits this version just fine. Winona Ryder was considered too young at the time for this serious project, but I think she does some of her best work. She is innocent and romantic and totally appealing. The rest of the cast is good too, though some work out better than others.My only real complaints with this version, and they are very minor, is Tom Waits doesn't quite have a handle on Reinfeld and the ending is all Coppola, differing form James V. Hart's script quite a bit. Still its marvelously entertaining from start to finish. Each time I watch it its like a new experience. Very, very good film. It certainly doesn't stint on the scares, or the blood! a must for serious fans of horror.",8,0,1,14 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the saga is complete
","Having lived with Star Wars all my life and loved virtually every minute of it, I was thrilled with Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith. It is a great Star Wars film. Absolutely great. The best of the prequels, though Episode 1 is still very close in my heart. Episode 3 is certainly the most emotional of the three prequels, very dark and tragic. My praise is high, the effects are superb, the music is great and the performances range from good to serviceable. My only tiff is with the DVD release, why were certain scenes omitted? I remember the film running over 2 and 1/2 hours in the theatre and suddenly on DVD its only 140 minutes long. Why George? Also the reaction shot of Anakin getting the mask laid on him has been changed. His initial reaction of fear, burned in my mind when I saw it on May 19th, is now more one of acceptance and want. Why does George feel the constant need to tinker? He even changed shots from the original trilogy, replacing the original actors with ian Macdiarmid and Hayden Christensen. Uncessecary. at Least with 4,5, and 6 we have the original verisons, but the DVD release of 'Sith' is somewhat disappointingly different. Other than that its a fantastic movie and a great completion to the Star Wars saga.",7,0,1,8 November 2005
Iron Man," Iron man rocks!
","Iron Man, based on the MArvel comics character, is a fun ride from start to finish. Robert Downey Jr. does a good job and Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly appealing as his assistant, ahem-Pepper Potts. The effects are really good and the score, which features AC/DC and Black Sabbath, is first rate.That's not to say it doesn't run out of gas about halfway in, that the middle section of the film is really boring. Hey if I wanted to watch someone work with a computer all day, I got to the Microsoft office!! The giant robot climax is pretty silly too. Still kudos to Jon Favreau for a good sense of humor here. You can't possibly take a comic book film too seriously and he doesn't. Downey has lots of fun with that, I did feel though that he never really takes Tony Stark beyond that playboy we meet in the first five minutes. Also I love Jeff Bridges, but what was he doing in this, Obie is such a moron! Any thinking bad guy would've iced Pepper when he found her in his office. I mean c'mon!! At least he rebounded with 'Crazy Heart', but sheesh.Iron Man is pretty good action, despite it's flaws and it's miles above pretentious nonsense like 'Unbreakable'. So if you like this sort of thing, you're likely to be pleased.",6,0,3,4 March 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," this movie will stay with you, always
","The original Star Wars, now known as 'Episode iv-A New Hope, is one of the greatest movies ever. I didn't particularly care for the technical update George Lucas made to it, was it really right to add such cheese? And why alter dialog? Example; Obi-Wan-'Mos Eisley spaceport, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.' Luke Skywalker-'I'm ready for anything.' Terrific stuff, why change it! That being said, it's a fast-paced awesome sci-fi flick.Admitteldy after you're reeling from the FX in the opening shot, the movie slows to follow C-3po and R2-D2, they're cute, but its a long 30 minutes. thankfully the plot picks up when were introduced to Luke and his Aunt and Uncle, moisture farmers on the barren planet of Tatooine. Luke is my favourite character in all six films and Mark Hamill does a great job portraying his innocence and courage. Soon we met Old Ben Kenobi, a former general and Jedi Knight of the Republic, now a recluse, but he knew Luke's shadowy father and tells Luke he must fight the Empire now strangling the galaxy.Lucas uses great editing and cutting to show the Empire at work, Peter Cushing, a veteran English actor known for his work in horror movies, is the cruel Grand Moff Tarkin, and in this film, it is he who hold Darth Vader's leash, as Leia says. Vader is simply one of the most iconic villains ever on screen, black and imposing, his breathing is so alien nd mechanical that you fear him. It's clear that young Leia Organa, played by Carrie Fisher, is the leader in the rebellion and hell-bent on destroying the Empire's greatest weapon, the Death Star. And yes, it does sadly resemble a giant, gray tomato.After his Aunt and Uncle are killed by the Empire's Stormtroppers, Luke and Ob-WAn ( Ben) go to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan, LEia's home world. Here we meet Han Solo, a cynical rogue played with youthful authority by HArrison Ford. They split in his Millennium Flacon only to find Alderaan destroyed by the Death STar. Here I always felt this scene was not given the significance a planet's destruction deserves. it's too brief and too vague, we never really see any of the planet, only Leia and Darth's reactions save this from being a failure. In fact we only get the briefest glimpse of what Alderran may have been like for Leia in Episode 3.Our heroes are trapped on the Death Star but thankfully they rescue princess Leia, but Darth Vader's confronts and kills Ob-Wan in one of the biggest shocks in cinematic history. To off Alec Guiness halfway through your movie was a very ballsy movie by Lucas.Our heroes are set up by Vader to lead them to the hidden Rebel base and only a desperate attempt by Luke can destroy the Death STar and save the galaxy. This final batter is patterned after WW2 films and is visual breathtaking. Some science fiction purists object to the Force in this movie, that destroying planets and relying on technology is no match for faith, but it makes this all very emotional and Han's selfless act is a big surprise and really works. Our heroes are decorated and the film end on John Williams' rousing score.In some ways this was meant to stand alone, only brief hints are given as to a massive back story for our characters and it doesn't hinder this episode or make it lacking. Star WArs- A NEw Hope is fantastic entertainment from start to finish. Some charges levied against the film, racism, silliness and a lack of depth, are groundless, originally James Earl Jones was not the voice of DArth Vader and Han Solo was black, and the obvious tension between Luke and Han over Leia was only to make a point of interest for older viewers. The film is exciting and grand and very much worth your time.",10,1,2,21 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," the empire kicks butt!
","Star Wars episode v-the empire strikes back is the critical darling of the six films, they loved its darker tone and serious plot twists and the FX is superb. Under pressure to write a full story for a movie he wasn't sure he'd make Lucas turned over directing to Irvin Kirshner, who does a fine job. Luke, Leia and Han have been pursed by the EMpire and specifically VAder who is obsessed with Luke, to the ice planet of Hoth. Amazing miniatures and FX lead to a terrible beating for the rebellion and they are on the run. Luke, advised by the spirit of Ob-Wan journeys to Degobah to meet Yoda, a JEdi master, while Han and Leia end up in Bespin to call on Han's old friend Lando Calrissian.Yoda is a puppet, but instantly feels real and is one of the most popular characters ever in cinema. Frank Oz (thats Miss Piggy to you!) does wonderful work and the training of Luke on the swampy bog really brings the philosophy of the Force home. Fantastic stuff. Han and Leia are betrayed by Lando and given over to DArth VAder, who really only wants Luke. Luke, against the advice of Both the cryptic Yoda and Obi-Wan goes to save them.Luke's battle with Vader is what everyone wanted after iv and its awesome, only Luke gets his butt kicked and loses his hand! Then Vader drops the bombshell to end all bombshell and tells Luke that Obi-Wan lied, 'No, I am your father!' Interstingly Vader is the Dutch word for father. Its a great, if very risky, twist and the actors give it all they've got. Han is frozen in carbonite and given to the bounty hunter Boba Fett to be delivered to the villainous and so far unseen JAbba the Hutt.The movie ends with the rebellion in disarray and Luke and Leia bereft of home and family. Lando, played with style by Billy Dee Williams, turn s out to be a hero and vows to find Han, along with the loyal Chewbacca. John Williams delivers another great score and the end leaves you breathless and wanting more. Oddly I had no qualms with the minor tinkering George Lucas did on this one. Outstanding and possibly the greatest sequel ever.",10,0,1,21 January 2008
True Romance," truly awesome!
","I hadn't watched 'True Romance' in years, I have it on videotape, what a great balls-out, utlra-cool movie! This movie kicked ass on every level. Tarantino showed why He'd be force in moves and Tony Scott is a great interpreter of his work.'True Romance' lives up to its title and then some. When comic store clerk Clarence (Slater) hooks up with Alabama (Patrica Arquette) all hell breaks loose as they try to unload a case of coke in Hollywood. They're just two kids with big dreams, its easy to imagine this in medieval times, talk about romance, peasant boys kills evil warlord to defend his lady's honor! Actually Clarence offs Drexl, unbelievably played by GAry Oldman, what a great actor! The cast is unreal! Brad Pitt plays permanently high roomie Floyd and makes you wonder what happened to this brilliant actor. I understand he may have done good work again in 'Jesse James', still here he was young and unkempt and theatrically brilliant in a small part. Remember Brad, there are no small parts only small actors.Dennis Hopper, a frigin genius, steals scenes and out-acts Chris Walken, no small feat, in a brilliant scene where he informs Mafioso Walken that he's a... Well watch the movie for that one. The film only gets better when they get to Hollywood. James Gandolfini, long before the 'Sopranos' scores as a hit man roughing up Alabama. He's awesome in this scene! Bronson Pinchot makes you forget 'Perfect Strangers' Though he is very funny here. The cops are great and was that really Eric Kramer as Saul Rubinek's thug? He deserves better than what he's gotten lately. Rubinek is great too, note the 'Godfather' like line, 'I treated you like a son, you f*ckin stab me in the heart!' Awesome.This flick is just great from start to finish, everyone did a superb job. I didn't even mention Sam Jackson, Val Kilmer or the late Chris Penn. This was one of the best flicks of the decade. Not to be missed! One note, this is a hard 'R' with strong language, extreme violence and some sex scenes.",8,2,4,6 November 2007
