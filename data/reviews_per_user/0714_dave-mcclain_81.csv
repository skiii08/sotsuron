Blade Runner 2049," better than the original!
","What on earth is a blade runner? Well who's asking? And why? You see, there are several ways to answer that question. The most obvious answer is 'Blade Runner' is a movie – a classic 1982 science fiction thriller directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young. In this film's dystopian future, a blade runner is a cop who hunts down and 'retires' (kills) synthetic human 'replicants' who have escaped back to earth from the 'out-worlds' where they served human colonists as slave labor. The story is an adaptation of the 1968 novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' by legendary sci-fi author Philip K. Dick. But the phrase 'blade runner' isn't even in the book!In fact, it was a phrase put in the original screenplay by 'Blade Runner' co-writer Hampton Fancher – and enthusiastically embraced by Scott. But the phrase didn't originate with Fancher. He picked it up from the title 'Blade Runner (A Movie)' by William S. Boroughs which was a treatment (and early version of a possible screenplay, hence the name) based on the 1974 novel 'The Blade Runner' by Alan E. Nourse. That book creates a dystopian future in which the law requires that people who seek medical treatment get sterilized so their illnesses and/or tendencies to injury don't get transmitted to future generations. In the story, an underground medical community functions with the help of smugglers called blade runners who supply outlaw doctors with supplies ranging from medications to scalpels.Of course, the focus of this review is the 2017 sci-fi thriller 'Blade Runner 2049' (R, 2:43). In an excellent article on theverge.com, writer Adi Robertson sums up the whole blade runner history this way: 'So 'Blade Runner 2049' is the sequel to a movie based on a book but named after a completely unrelated film treatment of yet another book, which was itself published as a third book with the subtitle 'A Movie'. In case that's not confusing enough, the latest reissue of 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' is also titled 'Blade Runner'. And we won't even get into the three Blade Runner sequel books by K.W. Jeter.' Obviously, when deciding whether to see this film, we all hope that its plot is less convoluted than the real-life story that brought us Movie Fans to this point – and that the 2017 film will satisfy fans of the 1982 original – as well as those who have never seen it or don't remember much of it.30 years after the events of the first film, newer, more human (but more obedient) replicants have been integrated into society, while the older models are still hunted down and retired by blade runners. 2049 Los Angeles is every bit as dark, dreary and damp as it was in 2019, just more technologically advanced, especially when it comes to the pervasive outdoor advertising (think huge electronic billboards which can be anywhere and have images that move and interact with prospective clients). One of the blade runners is simply known as K (Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling). K doesn't especially enjoy retiring replicants, but he loyally and competently serves his supervisor, Lieutenant Joshi (Golden Globe winner Robin Wright). Also, he has no friends and his roommate is a hologram named Joi (Ana de Armas).When K is sent to retire a newly-discovered rogue replicant named Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), K makes a curious discovery at Sapper's farm. K alerts Joshi who sends a dig team to the property. All this results in a startling revelation that Joshi tells K 'breaks the world.' Joshi is desperate to destroy any trace of what they have found. Niander Wallace (Oscar winner Jared Leto) is a replicant manufacturer with a serious god complex who is also very interested in the discovery in question. He sends his ruthless replicant assistant, Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), after anything and anyone linked to the discovery, leading K to go looking for answers himself. Along the way, he seeks help from replicant memory maker Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri) and eventually finds long-retired blade runner Rick Deckard (Oscar nominee Harrison Ford – who isn't the only member of the original cast to show up.) And then I stop, so as to avoid spoilers.'Blade Runner 2049' is actually superior to the first 'Blade Runner'. While Ridley Scott and company deserve credit for terrific creativity in bringing the original book to cinematic life (and creating a sci- fi classic), I didn't find the 1982 version to be especially compelling or well-acted. I have no such complaints about the sequel. The screenplay by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green honors its predecessor and takes the drama to a higher level. It also lays out a series of intriguing twists and surprising reveals from very early in the film and continuing until the very end – while asking some of the same questions eluded to in the first film – and taking them even further. There's just more at stake in the sequel – for the human race – and definitely for the individual characters (which are played superbly by all involved). Director Denis Villeneuve takes full advantage of the advances in cinematic technologies since 1982 and gives us visuals which are alternately (and in various combinations) raw, vibrant, haunting, erotic and just plain impressive. Both the original and the sequel are slowly paced and have minor plot holes, but 2017's version is much more entertaining. 'A-'",8,3,7,6 October 2017
Your Name.," 'Your Name' is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie.
","Sit back, relax and let me tell you what I think of Your Name. No, not your name (that would be way too personal) I'm talking about the Japanese anime fantasy feature film 'Your Name' (PG, 1:46). Now, if you're not familiar with Your Name, you should be. In the first place, who doesn't know their own name? (Okay, enough bad puns.) The MOVIE 'Your Name' opened in U.S. theaters on April 7, 2017, a little over seven months after its release in Japan. Before it even reached the U.S., the film had become the fourth biggest film ever at the Japanese box office, their top-grossing film of 2016 AND the #1 anime worldwide to date! Based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Makota Shinkai (who also wrote and directed the screen adaptation), there is much to distinguish this film from previous anime features.The film's roots are a combination of the traditional and the contemporary, as it forged a fresh path both in Japan and beyond. This is the first anime not directed by Hayao Miyazaki to make over $100 million (about 10 billion Yen) in Japan. 'Your Name' also became the highest-grossing Japanese release in China and was the first Japanese film in a dozen years to attain the top box office spot in South Korea. Not bad, for a film that is singularly Japanese. One of the reasons given for the film's success is the soundtrack, which includes songs from Yojiro Noda, lead singer for the Japanese rock band Radwimps. Critics and audiences have also praised the film's animation, as well as the plot and its emotional impact. According to Wikipedia, 'Inspiration for the story came from works including Shūzō Oshimi's 'Inside Mari', 'Ranma ½', the Heian period novel 'Torikaebaya Monogatari', and Greg Egan's short story 'The Safe-Deposit Box'.' The film's main location, a town called Itomori, is fictional, but the buildings and landscape are based on Japan's Gifu Prefecture. Itomori is where the central character in this story lives.Mitsuha Miyamizu (voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi in the Japanese version and by Stephanie Sheh in the dubbed English-language version) is a high school student who wants more out of life than what her tiny hometown has to offer. She's not very self-confident, she doesn't have many friends, she cares little for tradition and is even less enthusiastic about being the daughter of the town's mayor. While her tough, traditionalist widowed father is busy mayoring, Mitsuha and her young sister are being raised by her traditional, but kind grandmother. All of Mitsuha's frustrations boil over one day when she shouts into the sky that, instead of a meek country girl, she wishes she were a handsome boy living in Tokyo.Then it happened – Mitsuha wakes up one morning to discover she has mysteriously switched bodies with just such a young man named Taki Tachibana (Ryunosuke Kamiki / Michael Sinterniklaas). Both high schoolers are understandably disoriented and upset by finding themselves in the body of someone of the other gender, in a house with a family and going to a strange school in a different place and with friends whom they don't know. Mitsuha and Taki each believe they're dreaming, so they just get by as well as they can and wait to wake up. When they do each wake up the next morning, back in their own beds, they're relieved until their family and friends comment on how strange they've been acting.These body swaps continue happening, about every other day, but the memories of what Mitsuha and Taki each do in the other's body quickly fade, much like a dream. To keep track of what's going on, the two teens start leaving each other notes, first in paper notebooks, and then on their smartphones – and they start intervening in each other's lives. Mitsuha, as Taki, helps Taki start a romantic relationship with his supervisor at the restaurant where he works part-time, and Taki, as Mitsuha, helps her become more popular. When their body swaps suddenly and inexplicably stop, Taki tries to make contact with Mitsuha in real time, but cannot reach her by cell phone. He takes a train to her district, armed with sketchy and fading memories from his days as Mitsuha, and learns something which affects him profoundly and causes both he and Mitsuha to embark on separate, but parallel and highly significant tasks.'Your Name' is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie. The animation features especially vibrant colors and it is creative and skilled, often giving the impression of depth, even as a 2-D production. The movie also provides an interesting window into the world of modern Japan, through the juxtaposition of urban and rural environments. The main characters and supporting players are likable and fun to watch, but sometimes act illogically. More problematic, however, are dealing with the movie's plot holes and keeping track of who is who, when, and what is happening during some of the body swaps. But all of that aside, 'Your Name' features an interesting story, which includes elements of humor, excitement and even suspense and charms its audience. It combines influences from many sources, but still feels fresh, creative and vital. This film is 'Freaky Friday' meets 'The Lake House', with the look of an updated 'Spirited Away', and it's visually and emotionally pleasing in spite of its shortcomings. 'B+'",7,2,11,13 April 2017
Captain Phillips," 'Captain Phillips' does for the story of the Maersk Alabama what 'United 93' did for stories of heroism from 9/11.
","Sometimes movies almost write themselves. Many of us who remember following the news of the 2009 hijacking of the commercial ship Maersk Alabama and the kidnapping of its captain may also remember thinking how the saga played out much like a movie. Then, 2013 gave us 'Captain Phillips' (PG-13, 2:14). Of course, there's much more to the story than those news reports were able to tell us at the time. A quick internet search would give you the history of this event, but I'll still restrict myself to just setting up the plot, as I'd do in any other review, in case you want to see the story unfold as if for the first time.Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the Maersk Alabama's wise and experienced captain, guiding his cargo ship down the coast of eastern Africa when the vessel is attacked by Somali pirates. Phillips knows that these are dangerous waters and even has his crew drill and prepare for a potential piracy situation, but no one on the ship imagines that it will actually happen to them. When it does, both captain and crew show bravery, resourcefulness and smarts that stymie the pirates' plan to hold the ship for ransom. This leads the pirates to use the ship's enclosed life boat to get away, but with Captain Phillips as their hostage. This sets up a race against time with the U.S. Navy working to save Captain Phillips before the pirates can get him back to Somalia and ransom him to secure the payoff that they feel is their due.Everything about this film is superb. Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his impressive career. Every fear, every calculation, every bit of pain is etched across his face, while his righteous defiance undergirds it all. The pirates are played by four Americans (and real-life friends) of Somali descent (impressively led by Barkhad Abdi) and are all first-time actors. Still, they imbue their characters with an authenticity that makes us fear them and a humanity that stops short of making us sympathize with them, but helps us understand them. Paul Greengrass (who also directed the 2nd and 3rd movies in the 'Bourne' franchise and the underrated 'United 93') again shows that he's a master of tension and pacing. He makes this story fascinating to watch, even if you remember what happened during those four dramatic days. 'A'",9,0,2,28 October 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a great 'spiritual successor' to 2008's 'Cloverfield'.
","When is a movie a 'spiritual successor'? No, it doesn't have anything to do with ghosts procreating. A movie that is a spiritual successor or spiritual sequel to its predecessor is a movie that doesn't follow the same story line as the original, but has enough in common with the original's setting, themes or style that the new movie can be seen as 'in the spirit of' the film to which it's being compared. Another way to think about it is that the two movies exist in the same cinematic universe. They often also have the same production team. The closest example that comes to mind is the pair of '300' movies. The 2014 film '300: Rise of an Empire' had some overlap with the 2006 film '300' in time period, setting, themes and style, but had its own story almost completely apart from the story told in the first film.Similarly, the 2016 film '10 Cloverfield Lane' (PG-13, 1:43) is a distant relative of 2008's found-footage science fiction monster movie 'Cloverfield'. (Call them second cousins twice removed.) '10 Cloverfield Lane' is based on a screenplay entitled 'The Cellar' which Paramount purchased in 2012 and gave to J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions to develop it further. Bad Robot had produced the original 'Cloverfield' and Abrams has said that 'The Cellar' had 'so many elements that felt like the DNA of this story were of the same place that 'Cloverfield' was born out of.' Abrams adds that his company produced this film as a 'blood relative' of 'Cloverfield'. Unfortunately, using the name of the original in the title of its very different successor is a bit of a spoiler, but the setting (mostly underground), the themes (wondering what's really happening when you can't see it) and style (traditional camera-work rather than 'found footage'), allows Movie Fans to still enjoy this film, whether they saw (and liked) 'Cloverfield' or not.Speaking of avoiding spoilers, doing so prevents me from going as far into the plot of this movie as I usually do in my reviews, but here's the basic set-up: Mary Elizabeth Winstead is Michelle, a young Louisiana woman who leaves her fiancé, Ben (Bradley Cooper). As she's driving down an isolated 2-lane highway, she gets into a car accident that leaves her injured and unconscious. She wakes up in an underground bunker in the care of a survivalist who identifies himself as Howard (John Goodman). He tells Michelle that he saved her life – not just from dying of her injuries – but from an 'attack' that has left everyone above ground either dead or dying. He says he's not sure if the attack was perpetrated by the Russians, the Martians, or(?), but he's adamant that leaving the bunker would mean certain death.Michelle is skeptical, to say the least, even after she meets the bunker's other resident, Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.) who backs up everything Howard has said. Emmett is a contractor who helped Norman build his doomsday bunker over a period of years and then fought to be let in when, lo and behold, Armageddon actually happened! Howard is a Navy veteran who seems paranoid and occasionally exhibits other odd and even volatile behaviors, but his end-of-the-world man cave does have all the comforts of home and it does appear that Howard has saved their lives, so Michelle and Emmett settle in, become friends and even learn to get along with Howard for a while. As with all good thrillers, surprises, suspense and a struggle for survival await some or all of the main characters.'10 Cloverfield Lane' is a great spiritual successor that builds on the legacy of 'Cloverfield' with an entirely different framework. The unusual circumstances that I related above regarding how this movie came to be provide us with an original story that effectively taps into the original's fear and sense of foreboding. The plot allows for a departure from the overused found-footage format and gives us a uniquely creepy and claustrophobic vibe. The performances also come across as very authentic. Early in the movie, we feel Michelle's disorientation and fear. Then, we are put somewhat at ease by Emmett's presence and his good-guy friendliness. Throughout the film, much like those two characters do, we alternate between feeling good about Norman and being suspicious of him. Is he paranoid because he's crazy? Is he crazy because he's paranoid? Or is he simply a well-meaning but neurotic loner who has been thrown off his game by unexpectedly living out an apocalyptic version of 'Three's Company'? And how does the 2008 film relate to all this? All good questions. On its way to giving us good answers, '10 Cloverfield Lane' keeps us off balance, but will ultimately satisfy most Movie Fans, whether they saw (and liked) 'Cloverfield' or not.

The Finest Hours," This film will give you and your family two of the finest hours you'll spend in a theater this year.
","Coasties get no respect. At least, not as much as soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines get. Even the word may sound derogatory to an outsider, but coastie is actually the most widely accepted term for Coast Guardsmen. Less complimentary terms include the 'Navy National Guard', 'the Navy's little sister' and 'puddle pirates'. See? No respect. Even though the roots of the U.S. Coast Guard go back to 1790 and its current missions make it as valuable in peacetime as in wartime, and its focus is jobs that none of the other armed services undertake regularly (if at all), few people know much about coasties. I blame the movies. There aren't very many Coast Guard movies out there. 2006's 'The Guardian' is the only one I could think of before 2016's 'The Finest Hours' (PG-13, 1:57), which really is an 'incredible true story'! In this film, Chris Pine takes a break from the bridge of the Starship Enterprise to captain a much smaller ship, but one in no less danger than his ship in the 'Star Trek' movies. Pine plays Boatswain's Mate First Class Bernard Webber, stationed in Chatham, Massachusetts in the early 1950s. As a coastie, he's very capable, but meek. As a man, he's handsome, but shy. Nevertheless, Bernie rises to any occasion when presented with a challenge. He wins the heart of a pretty and assertive local girl named Miriam (Holliday Grainger) and soon they're engaged. On the day that Bernie plans to officially notify his commanding officer (Eric Bana) that he's getting married, he gets sent out into a nor'easter to rescue about three dozen merchant mariners whose ship was one of two disabled in this especially severe winter storm.The ship in question is the oil tanker, SS Pendleton. Due to a series of unfortunate events so bad that they'd make Lemony Snicket shudder, Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck), the Pendleton's engineer, ends up leading the efforts of the crew in trying to notify someone of the ship's location and keeping it afloat long enough for the men to be rescued. Ray has to contend with the ship's greatly diminished capabilities, the rising water inside the ship and the members of the crew who strongly disagree on the best course of action. Fortunately, Ray has on his side Seaman Wallace Quirey (John Ortiz), the ship's jovial and hulking cook (Abraham Benrubi) and an old salt named Frank Fauteux (Graham McTavish), but their loyalty only helps so much – especially in this weather! As the men on the Pendleton are fighting for survival, Bernie is fighting to get to them in time, and Miriam is doing what she can from the shore. Bernie can only find three other men to accompany him on what some openly call 'a suicide mission'. Without telling Miriam that he's going, he sets out with Seaman Richard Livesey (Ben Foster), Engineman Third Class Andrew Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and Seaman Ervin Maske (John Magaro) on a motorized lifeboat meant to hold no more than 12 men. How these four men in this small boat are going to make it through this storm over a major sand bar, find the Pendleton and rescue up to 41 men are the serious problems facing Boatswain Bernard Webber's crew.'The Finest Hours', based on the book of the same name, and as produced by Walt Disney Pictures, is an excellent, if not completely accurate tale of heroism. First of all, you're struck with how incomprehensibly gutsy simply undertaking this rescue mission was for Webber and his crew – and how utterly hopeless the situation seemed for Sybert and his seafaring comrades. It's simply great storytelling. Part of the story's effectiveness lies with the important role Miriam and her impending marriage to Bernie play in the story. Although Bernie and Miriam did marry in real life, much about their relationship and her role in the events portrayed has been fabricated for dramatic purposes. It feels like unnecessary embellishment of an already dramatic story.The acting is one of this film's additional strengths. I feel that this was one of Casey Affleck's best roles and finest performances to date. Pine is very good, but having him play a good-looking guy who is insecure about his looks seemed a little silly. The rest of the cast is solid, as is the directing of the little-known but versatile Craig Gillespie, and the quality of the writing in this adaptation by Eric Johnson, Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy. The gale-force visual effects are the best this side of 2000's 'The Perfect Storm', while the 3D, and, if you have access to them, D-Box seats, really enhance the experience. This film tells a relatively simple story and feels a little old fashioned, but that's part of its charm. Come to think of it, with its complete absence of sexual content or mano-a-mano violence and its light use of adult language, 'The Finest Hours' also works very well as a family film. This movie will give you two of the finest hours that you and/or your family are likely to have watching a movie this year. 'A-'",8,4,14,30 January 2016
Deepwater Horizon," The strengths of 'Deepwater Horizon' are its strong characters and its extraordinary attention to detail.
","Peter Berg makes movies, but he also knows a lot about deep-water oil exploration. He'd have to, considering how complicated this dangerous activity is, and how well he handled those complexities and portrayed that danger in his film. Berg directed 'Deepwater Horizon' (PG-13, 1:47), the dramatization of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil rig explosion which killed 11 people and resulted in the largest oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history. A combination of faulty equipment and human error caused the disaster. Methane gas escaping up the rig's pipes enveloped it, ignited and eventually consumed the rig, which burned until sinking into the ocean 36 hours after the initial explosion. The titular rig's owner, Transocean, and its client, BP, traded accusations of wrongdoing for years, while various cases worked their way through the courts – and a lengthy environmental clean-up of the gulf coast proceeded. No one went to jail, but, according to Wikipedia, 'To date BP's cost for the clean-up, environmental and economic damages and penalties has reached $54bn.' But that's all scientific and industrial detail. This film is mainly a story about people.Berg (with his screenwriters, Matthew Michael Carnahan and Michael Sand) personalizes the story by focusing on a few key people involved in the events depicted. Master electrician Mike Williams (played by Mark Wahlberg, who Berg also directed in 2013's 'Lone Survivor') is a devoted family man with a loving wife (Kate Hudson) and a sweet and precocious daughter (Stella Allen), who's very proud of her dad and his job. Radio operator Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) is a young, single woman who has a steady boyfriend and loves her vintage Ford Mustang, even if she does have trouble keeping it running. Both Mike and Andrea work for 'Mr. Jimmy' (Kurt Russell, appearing on film for the first time with Hudson, who is his adopted daughter) is the caring, but tough and diligent Transocean foreman on Deepwater Horizon, who often finds himself at odds with BP's corporate representatives on the oil rig.As Mr. Jimmy and his crew arrive at the rig for their three-week-long turn on board, it's apparent that the departing shift (including Berg, in a cameo role, in which he briefly talks with Russell's character) hasn't done their due diligence in taking care of operation and safety concerns on the rig. While entertaining two BP executives who are visiting Deepwater Horizon (and who present him with a safety award during a brief ceremony), Mr. Jimmy locks horns with BP liaison Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich). Mr. Jimmy insists on a test of the pressure entering the well from beneath the ocean floor. When the test gives conflicting results and the results of an alternate follow-up test complicates the situation further, the stage is set for disaster. The rest of the film depicts that disaster with astonishing detail and realism as everyone on that rig fights for survival and for the goal of getting back safely to their families.'Deepwater Horizon' is a fascinating, entertaining and inspiring take on a real-life disaster. We get good character development and a detailed behind-the-scenes look at the considerations, disagreements and actions that led up to the catastrophic explosion, but there are a couple problems with all that. Berg does a good job with a combination of dialog, on-screen verbiage and impressive visuals to help us understand the dynamics at play, but it almost seems like too much, and the conversations, with a lot of technical jargon, characters talking over each other and seeming to mumble their lines, and some with various southern accents and some without, combine to make it difficult to tune one's ear to the dialog and understand everything that's being said. However, the main point of this movie is the survival story. Berg had a realistic version of the rig built (including many working components) for shooting. His attention to detail – in the set and in the film's visual effects is nothing short of remarkable. What's more, we care about the characters and the danger they're in feels real. For excellent acting, a well-developed story and incredible visuals, you should put this film on your horizon. 'B+'",7,48,69,30 September 2016
It," It is a very good horror film, but it has some problems.
","It is terrifying. It exploits your fears in order to make you It's victim. It wants to kill and eat you. It is not of this world, which is why it is called It. The character of It was created by horror novelist Stephen King in his 1986 book, which became a successful two-part four-hour television mini-series in 1990, and then, 27 years later, the extremely successful feature film 'It' (R, 2:15). All three incarnations tell the story of a demonic alien entity which basically rode an asteroid down to earth millions of years ago and emerges every 27 years for a year or so to feed on the residents (especially the children) of what has become known as the (fictional) town of Derry, Maine. It can shape-shift, appearing in forms which best exploit the fears of It's intended victims, but It's go-to manifestation is a clown called Pennywise, who looks like a combination of Bozo, Clarabell and Ronald McDonald, but is both child-like and pure evil. The people of Derry seem to forget the disappearances caused by It and simply move on with their lives. During one of It's feeding cycles, a motley crew of socially outcast kids work together to kill It, if possible, or at least to vanquish It from the town. After they're at least partially successful, the kids take an oath to return to the town to fight It again in case It reappears in another 27 years. Of course, It does, and they do. The novel and the miniseries covered both halves of that story, taking place 1957-58 and 1984-85, while the movie sets the first part in 1988-89 and then ends by setting up a sequel taking place 2015-2016. It uses the sewers below Derry to move about the town and snatch up as many kids as possible so, naturally, It's first appearance on screen is from inside a sewer grate. As Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), It lures a little boy named Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) close enough to grab him, leaving his older brother, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) unable to accept the reality of Georgie's disappearance. Several months later, it's the last day of school and we see Bill as the de facto leader of a group of 11-13-year-old social outcasts who start calling themselves the Losers Club. They are tormented by a group of bullies led by the sadistic and unbalanced Henry (Nicholas Hamilton). The Losers each have a defining characteristic which fuels the bullying: Bill stutters, Richie (Finn Wolfhard) is a loudmouth, Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) is a hypochondriac, Stan (Wyatt Oleff) is Jewish, Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is fat, Mike (Chosen Jacobs) is black and Bev (Sophia Lillis) is a girl who is rumored to be having sex, which is not true, except possibly with her father (Stephen Bogaert), who we see speak to and touch Bev inappropriately several times. Besides the bullies, It uses each of the Losers Club members' special characteristics against them.As the summer begins, Bill is trying to lead his friends to help him find Georgie, whom Bill wants to believe is simply missing in the city's sewer system, but the guys find much more down there than they bargained for. When the Losers Club is complete (with the addition of Ben, Mike and Bev, thanks to the actions of Henry and company), the group bonds while swimming in the quarry, getting into a rock fight with the bullies and, especially, chasing It. Through their combined knowledge of the town, these kids piece together the reasons that so many kids disappear in Derry and they seem to be the only ones willing and able to do something about It. It must feel threatened, because It begins to haunt each of the kids (appearing as Pennywise and in various other frightening forms) and attempts to kill all of them. Trying to outsmart It, outrun the bullies & outlast their abusive parents makes for quite a summer vacay. 'It' is a very good horror movie, but it has some problems. Most importantly, this is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel and is one of the scariest movies of the year. It's kind of like if Steven Spielberg remade 'E.T.' as a horror film. The script, by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga (the film's original director) and Gary Dauberman features good character development and tells an exciting and complete story, even as it leads into the follow-up film in this pre-planned duology. Director Andy Muschietti (who helmed 2013's 'Mama') gives us plenty of good scares and disturbing images and gets remarkable ensemble work from his cast of mostly child actors (most of whom had very little experience before this movie), while Bill Skarsgård (with the help of great costumes and makeup) puts the perfect combination of creepy whimsy and dangerous menace into his performance. Unfortunately, we also get bullies who are unrealistically aggressive, kids who use an uncomfortable amount of adult language, universally useless adults who range from impotent to abusive, and plot points which aren't sufficiently developed. 'It' is imperfect, but it definitely entertains. 'B+'",7,2,8,9 September 2017
Detroit," enlightening, but frustrating
","Long before the 1992 L.A. riots that were sparked by the Rodney King verdict, in 1967, the city of Detroit endured riots depicted in the historical crime drama 'Detroit' (R, 2:23). The two uprisings were separated by a quarter century, but the underlying causes and results were very similar. Back in 1943, in the middle of World War II, Detroit had previously been the scene of major rioting. Those two Detroit uprisings were separated by nearly a quarter century, but the underlying causes and results were very similar. The riots of '43 were an expression of frustration by the black community over poor economic conditions and abusive treatment by police. Some of the police committed additional abuses while trying to put down the riots, while some of the rioters took advantage of the chaotic situation to loot business, destroy buildings and harm people who had nothing to do with the problems in their communities. 24 years later, many of the same conditions and frustrations still existed in Detroit's black communities and in July 1967, in the middle of the Vietnam War, tensions boiled over again, with similar results. Almost exactly 50 years after those riots, Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow ('The Hurt Locker') chronicles what happened during that week in Detroit and, in particular, tries to clarify the still somewhat murky story of what took place on the night of July 25-26 at a motel called the Algiers.In 1967, Detroit's inner city was a tinderbox of racial tension and social unrest, needing only a spark to make it explode. This film starts by showing the incident that provided that spark – and depicts the explosion that followed. Late Saturday night / early Sunday morning, July 23, 1967, police raided an unlicensed drinking establishment on 12th Street. The police, who were almost all white, arrested everyone who was in the club, all of whom were black. A crowd gathered outside began harassing the police and throwing things, forcing the police to withdraw as soon as their raid was complete. Emotions were running high and the crowd began looting nearby stores, beginning what turned out to be about five days of riots. Police tried to restore order, but weren't supposed to shoot looters, although that's exactly what we police officer Phillip Krauss (Will Poulter) do. As the violence continued, public events were being cancelled, such as a concert where the up and coming singing group The Dramatics was just about to take the stage. Instead, the guys hopped a bus and tried to make it home, but the chaos of the ongoing rioting led them to take refuge in The Algiers. Very close to that motel was black security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) who got called in to help protect his boss' grocery store from looters. Dismukes makes nice with the National Guard troops who take up a position across the street by bringing them coffee and chatting them up. And so the stage is set for the Algiers Motel Incident.The Algiers was filling up fast with people seeking safety from the ongoing riots. Almost all of the Algiers' guests were black, but there were two 18-year-old white girls there (Kaitlyn Dever and Hannah Murray), visiting from Ohio. They are approached by one of the guys from the Dramatics, 'Cleveland' Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend, Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) and the four of them get friendly, hanging out by the motel pool. Later, they go up to the room of Carl Cooper (Jason Mitchell), where there is a small party going on. As Cooper is messing around with one of his friends, he fires off a starter pistol that others think is a real gun. Soon, the sound catches the attention of people outside who now think there is a sniper shooting from the Algiers. National Guard troops, Michigan State Police and Detroit police, led by officer Krauss swarm the hotel, some of them literally shooting first and asking questions later. Dismukes ends at the Algiers too, but Krauss takes the lead. He and his fellow cops spend the rest of the night terrorizing, threatening, abusing and eventually killing motel guests, at first trying to find out who the 'sniper' is and, later, covering their tracks when things get out of hand. Krauss struggles to orchestrate and continue the cover-up as he, two other officers and Dismukes stand trial for murder.'Detroit' is a strong and valuable dramatization of historical events, but falls short of its true potential. As Bigelow directs the script by Mark Boal (with whom she also collaborated on 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty'), she tries to do too much. She shows scenes of the 12 Street Riot without really setting up the vital historical context or effectively portraying its development. When she gets to what she really wants to focus on, the Algiers Motel Incident, she allows to hang over those scenes the question as to why the people who knew that Cooper only had a starter pistol never said so while the police were brutally interrogating them. And then the courtroom scenes are so short and tightly edited, that they don't really tell us much. By trying to tell two stories – the general story of the riots – and the specific story of the Algiers and its aftermath, the film doesn't tell either of them especially well. However, Bigelow does present images of 1967 Detroit that look so authentic, you'll almost think you're actually there, and she gets excellent performances from all of her actors, regardless of their varying levels of experience. The two main things Movie Fans will learn from this movie regarding race relations in America (especially with stories like this one regularly echoing in the news) are how far we've come, and far we have yet to go. To be sure, both are important lessons, but 'Detroit' could have accomplished so much more. 'B'",6,19,42,31 July 2017
The Death of Stalin," clever and insightful, but not as funny as it tries to be
","'The Death of Stalin' (R, 1:46) is a British political satire comedy, co-written and directed by Armando Iannucci, based on a French graphic novel, about the events leading up to, surrounding and immediately following the 1953 demise of Joseph Stalin, the long-time leader of the U.S.S.R. You might well wonder whether the violence of the Soviet dictator's regime would be appropriate fodder for a comedy film, or whether such a comedy could even work. Fair questions and, after watching this film, I'd say valid ones.The film opens with a dinner party thrown by Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) and attended by his inner circle of Nikita Khrushchev and Georgy Malenkov (Golden Globe and Emmy winners Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor), Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale) and Vyacheslav Molotov (Monty Python veteran Michael Palin). During that gathering, Stalin causes a minor panic by in a concert hall by personally asking for a recorded copy of that night's performance, and panic also comes to various individuals around Moscow as Stalin's security forces go after those on his most recent enemies list, as published by Beria. All of this tells us a lot about the main characters and Stalin's regime and nicely sets the stage for what is to come.The rest of the movie concerns itself with the titular event and its aftermath, focusing on the comical inefficiency of the Soviet regime and backstabbing among its high-ranking officials. After the aforementioned dinner party, after Stalin reads some hate mail sent to him by an idealistic and gutsy musician (Olga Kurylenko), then has a medical episode and collapses. Over the next 12 hours or so, Stalin's personal security detail, various government officials and a motley crew of doctors who are eventually called, all bungle their responses and Stalin dies. Then Stalin's children, a naïve drama queen (Andrea Riseborough) and an unhinged alcoholic (Emmy nominee Rupert Friend) show up, adding to the mayhem, followed quickly by the self-important Soviet Army chief, Field Marshall Zhukov (Jason Isaacs). Meanwhile, the men in the dead dictator's inner circle jockey for power and scheme against each other.'The Death of Stalin' is clever, but not as funny as it wants to be. The movie tries to walk the fine line between taking the events it depicts somewhat seriously and showing the ridiculousness of the Soviet system in the early-mid 1950s and the men who ran it. The film walks that line well, but in doing so, fails to be very entertaining. The tragic historical facts of Stalin's murderous regime and the way its inefficiency fueled the Cold War with the United States makes the jokes less funny, but the nods to the seriousness of those situations keep the jokes from going far enough to be funnier. Despite the excellent cast, that middle-of-the-road approach to making a comedy about Stalin's death results in a middle-of-the-road grade from me, teetering on the edge of whether to recommend this movie or not... but barely coming down on the side of not.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 'Rogue One' is an exciting sci-fi adventure and a worthy addition to the Star Wars canon.
","It's easy to understand why Disney would make a movie called 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' (PG-13, 2:14), but explaining how it ties in with the other films is a bit more challenging. One tongue-in-cheek meme explains 'Rogue One' this way: 'It is a sequel to the prequels of the sequels of the prequels that are the originals in which this is a prequel of, but not a sequel to the sequel of the originals.' That's both humorously accurate and confusing, so let me give it a try: In the chronology of the Star Wars universe, this film falls between the prequel trilogy (Episodes I-III), released 1999-2005, and the original trilogy (Episodes IV-VI), released 1977-1983. In other words, at the beginning of the film originally titled 'Star Wars' (the one which first introduced our galaxy to the Star Wars galaxy in 1977), Princess Leia hides a disc inside the droid R2-D2 – stolen schematics to the Empire's planet-killing Death Star weapon – plans meant for the Rebel Alliance. 'Rogue One' is the story of how the rebels got those Death Star plans.Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is alone in the world. (Of course, in her case, 'world' means 'galaxy' – a galaxy far, far away from those of us who generally restrict our activities to a single planet.) When she was just a little girl, Jyn's mother, Lyra, was killed by Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn ), the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military, while Lyra was trying to prevent Krennic from taking her husband, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen), from their home and out of retirement to resume work on the Empire's Death Star. Galen had no choice but to leave his daughter behind. Jyn hasn't seen him since. She was cared for by a friend of the family, a rebel named Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), a veteran of the Clone Wars depicted in Star Wars Episodes II and III. But Saw also ended up abandoning Jyn – when she was just 16 – and she's been on her own ever since. When we first see her as an adult, she's on an imperial prison transport ship, in custody for an unnamed crime. She's jaded, bitter, defiant and alone.Suddenly, Jyn's rescued from the transport by rebel forces led by an intelligence officer named Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). The Rebel Alliance wants her help in finding her father so they can capture him to learn what they can about the Death Star – or kill Galen to stop his work on the deadly project. Jyn wants no part of the rebellion, but is motivated by the possibility of being reunited with her father. She goes with Cassian and his captured, reprogrammed imperial droid, K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk). They are soon joined by Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), an imperial pilot who defected in order to warn the Alliance about the Death Star's power, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen), a blind warrior who is not a Jedi, but is very devoted to the Force and knows how to use it, and Baze Malbus (Jiang Wen), a mercenary Rebel warrior, and Chirrut's companion. This rag-tag group is being pursued across the galaxy by Krennic and his Imperial soldiers, who are being directed by none other than Grand Moff Tarkin, played by Guy Henry, underneath the digitally-recreated face of deceased actor Peter Cushing. As this movie can be seen as a prequel to 'Star Wars' ('Episode IV'), other characters from the original film make appearances (as do ships and places), but I'll reveal no more plot in order to avoid spoiling the fun for Star Wars fans.'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is a very worthy addition to the Star Wars canon. But this begs the question as to whether someone who isn't familiar with the franchise (if there is such a Movie Fan out there) can follow and enjoy this addition to the cinematic saga. In a word, 'yes'. The plot is well-explained and the conflicts are well-defined. There's plenty of action and terrific visual effects. Devoted Star Wars fans will appreciate all that, the cameos by beloved (and hated) characters, as well as the new characters, especially Jyn, who comes off as a female version of Han Solo. There are also numerous homages to Star Wars lore, including X-Wing and TIE fighters, AT-ATs and other familiar sights and sounds. However, some will be disappointed by the absence of the beloved John Williams music and the iconic narrative crawl at the opening, omissions which rob this film of some of its potential impact.'Rogue One' was originally conceived by John Knoll, a visual effects supervisor for the prequel trilogy (Episodes I-III) and the original script was written by Gary Whitta ('The Book of Eli', 'After Earth'), but the final script was the work of Chris Weitz ('About a Boy', 2015's 'Cinderella') and Tony Gilroy (the 'Bourne' films + 'Armageddon'), with Gareth Edwards (2014's 'Godzilla' and 2010's 'Monsters') directing. This group may not be Star Wars royalty, but they have honored the saga's history and maintained its spirit. The intrepid members of the Rebel Alliance have always been a motley crew, but 'Rogue One' puts their courage and determination on display as well as any of the other films, and this one offers plenty for any sci-fi fan to enjoy. As I and another member of our staff left the theater, I looked around and commented that relatively few people in the audience had been born when the original 'Star Wars' was released, yet the auditorium was full. With other Star Wars Stories about Boba Fett and a young Han Solo in the works the hits just keep on coming. 2016's Star Wars Story gets an 'A-'.",8,1,7,16 December 2016
Passengers," part science fiction action-adventure, part romance, part morality play – and all engrossing
","'Passengers' (PG-13, 1:56) is indeed a sci-fi adventure movie, but it is not, as you might assume from its theatrical trailer, an action movie. There is action in it, but its entertainment value and the meaning of its story both come from places much deeper than your typical sci-fi actioner – and have the symbolism to match. The film's premise concerns a futuristic business arrangement in which an earth-based company sells tickets to people who are passengers on the company's spaceship which will take them to a distant planet which they will then colonize. The destination planet in this story is called Homestead II, which could be seen to represent the self-sufficient lifestyle known as homesteading and/or the Homestead Act of 1862 in which the U.S. government gave qualifying citizens uninhabited lands out west. The spaceship that's taking this story's passengers to their new home is named Avalon, which hearkens back to a fabled island paradise that's part of the legend of King Arthur. One of this film's titular passengers is named Aurora, the same name used for the title character in Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty', which is very appropriate for a main character who is one of 5,000 people who are supposed to hibernate aboard the Avalon for 120 years until they are about to arrive at Homestead II. Supposed to. For one last bit of symbolism, check out the movie's poster. The dots and dashes below the title ominously represent the Morse code message 'S.O.S.', which is said to stand for 'Save Our Ship'.The trouble starts when all of the passengers and crew are 30 years into their hibernation and a small meteor passes through the Avalon, beginning a slowly unfolding chain reaction of malfunctions. One of the first mechanical glitches results in Avalon passenger Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) waking up from his scientifically induced sleep and then discovering that he is the only one awake. Realizing that waking up 90 years early dooms him to spend the rest of his life on the Avalon and almost certainly die before it reaches its destination, Jim (who happens to be a mechanical engineer by trade) desperately tries to figure out how to return to hypersleep to no avail. After trying everything he can think of and eventually running out of ideas about how to fix his predicament, and with only an android bartender (Michael Sheen) for company, a beautiful woman named Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) also rises too early.Jim and Aurora are now the only two people awake on the Avalon – and are completely unaware that the ship is malfunctioning. Aurora is a writer who gave up her life on earth for the adventure of traveling to another world, while the appeal of Homestead II from Jim's point of view is one of using his talents in a fresh way and building something new. These two passengers are very different, but turn out to be a great match. They spend a lot of time together, take advantage of the ship's futuristic amenities and form an undeniable emotional attachment. But is it love or a lack of options? And what will happen when the ship's barely noticeable glitches become serious problems? Those are just a couple of the questions that this story raises – along with several intense and thought-provoking ethical dilemmas.'Passengers' is an intimate, but complex and very entertaining film. Written by Jon Spaihts (who gave us similarly deep, imaginative and entertaining scripts for 2012's 'Prometheus' and 2016's 'Doctor Strange') uses the sci-fi genre to tell a story that is part science fiction action-adventure, part romance, part morality play – and all engrossing. Director Morten Tyldum (who also directed the 2014 Best Picture Oscar nominee 'The Imitation Game') makes the film in turns dramatic, suspenseful, sweet and heart-breaking and makes sure we have great visuals on which to feast our eyes. This film is a combination of 'Cast Away', 'Titanic', 'Gravity' and 'When Harry Met Sally', but has an impact all its own, an impact that's difficult to convey to someone who hasn't experienced it – and impossible to communicate without resorting to major spoilers. The film touches on genre tropes and suffers from minor plot holes, but avoids cheap twists and unearned emotional moments and will leave you loving the journey it takes you on – and thinking deep thoughts long after the credits roll. With a great writer-director combination, wondrous sights, and layered, heartfelt, sympathetic performances from its stars, 'Passengers' is a head and heart trip you should definitely take.

Zootopia," 'Zootopia' is an excellent family movie with a message.
","Prejudice is very difficult to root out. (Yeah, this is a review about an animated Disney movie, but why can't a family film also have a more mature message?) Unlike discrimination, which refers to overt acts that society can deal with (mostly) through properly-enforced laws and well-designed public policy, prejudice is an attitude and cannot be legislated away. The word prejudice developed from the medieval legal term 'prejudgment' and today refers to a wide variety of prejudgments that people make every day, based on someone else's association with a certain group. These are prejudices people often hold for their entire lives – sometimes without even realizing it. Does being a Muslim mean supporting terrorism or being atheist mean lacking morals? Is being short a sign of weakness or being fat an indication of gluttony? Are most black people criminals or most whites racist? Most (if not all) of us would answer 'no' to all these questions if asked by another person, and would probably feel we were answering honestly. But do our actions or choice of words at other times betray some deep-seated prejudices we may not be aware that we have? Along with being an excellent movie which most people will find entertaining regardless of their age, the animated feature 'Zootopia' (PG, 1:48) subtly asks these questions to the more mature members of the audience, while carrying important messages to all.Zootopia is a big city in a land where humans don't exist and anthropomorphic animals have formed their own orderly society. Having evolved beyond their primal roles of predator and prey, they all live together in relative peace and harmony, except when jealousy, greed or prejudices raise their ugly heads. (Hey, animals are people too.) One of those walking talking animals is Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a young female bunny who fulfills her much-derided childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit to join the Zootopia Police Department. As Judy leaves behind her parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake), and her 275 siblings, to take the train from rural Bunnyburrow into the colorful big city with its tall buildings and varied habitat neighborhoods, you can easily imagine Taylor Swift's 'Mean' playing in the background. But the meanness doesn't stop when Judy starts her new hard-won job.When Judy takes her place among the wolves, lions, tigers, rhinos and elephants that she now calls colleagues, they all overlook her (literally and figuratively). Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a cape buffalo, assigns her parking meter duty, at which she immediately excels, but she wants more out of her job than being a meter maid. She becomes aware of the mysterious disappearance of over a dozen animals from different predatory species around the city and she promises one worried wife (Octavia Spencer) that she will help. Judy develops a lead which takes her to a con-man fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) whom she promptly cons into helping her pursue that lead. The trail of evidence they follow takes them to a naturist club run by a free-spirited Yak (Tommy Chong), to a DMV office run by sloths (a clever joke supported by the voices of Raymond S. Persi and Kristen Bell), to the feared crime boss Mr. Big (Maurice LeMarche), to City Hall to get the help of Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwhether (Jenny Slate) and to a secret medical facility controlled by Mayor Lionheart (JK Simmons). As Judy and Nick figure out what's really going on, they learn some surprising and important things about each other – and themselves.'Zootopia' really does have something for everyone. The littlest audience members will enjoy the colorful scenery, the variety of animals and the action sequences, and are likely to identify with the undersized main character with oversized dreams. Teens and adults will appreciate the sly references to 'Breaking Bad' and 'The Godfather', the presence of Shakira as a singing gazelle known as 'Gazelle' and the important lessons about fighting to be taken seriously and the damaging effects of prejudice. As well-written, well-animated and well-voiced as this film is, its main strength and importance lie in its messages. Prejudice is shown as self-perpetuating and, when allowed to exist unchallenged, actually able to reverse society's progress in the areas of equality and tolerance. Unfortunately, those lessons, as important as they are, sometimes come off a bit oversimplified – and so central to the story, that it's not quite as much fun as I'd expect an animated film to be. Still, 'Zootopia' is an excellent family film. 'A-'",8,5,15,6 March 2016
Green Room," If you appreciate an original, economical, tense horror-thriller, you might want to make room in your life for some green.
","Green Room is a common show business term for the area where performers relax while waiting for their turn on a theater stage or television program, or for guests waiting for their scheduled appearance on a talk show. These rooms are rarely actually painted green, and no one definitely knows the origin of the term, but it now also refers to the crime-horror-thriller 'Green Room' (R, 1:35). This is the third crime-thriller/horror film written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier (after 2007's 'Murder Party' and 2013's 'Blue Ruin'), but also bears a resemblance to another recent 'Green' film. (More on that later.) The Ain't Rights is a northwestern U.S. punk rock band in search of a gig. This is the kind of group that parties so hard that they all pass out in their van in the middle of a corn field with the engine running and then siphon gas from a car in a nearby parking lot in order to get back on the road. After Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Joe Cole), and Tiger (Callum Turner) play a club that barely pays them enough for a tank of gas, a punk music blogger (David W. Thompson), who recently interviewed them, sends them to a better-paying, but remote club where his cousin works. The bar turns out to be full of skinheads whom the band intentionally antagonizes by starting their set with a cover of The Dead Kennedys' 'Nazi Punks, F*** Off!' The Ain't Rights eventually win over the crowd with their original stuff, but when they're finished, the end of their set turns out to be just the beginning of their problems.Just as the band members are about to leave the club, Pat runs back to the green room to retrieve a cell phone that Sam had left charging and he sees a young woman lying on the floor with a knife sticking out of her head. Pat quickly dials 911, but before he can fully explain what he saw, two bouncers named Justin and Gabe (Eric Edelstein and Macon Blair) take the band's cell phones and hustle them back into the green room. They're locked in, along with a club regular named Amber (Imogen Poots), and held at bay by Justin and his .357 Magnum. Gabe attempts to deal with the police and calls the club's owner (Patrick Stewart). The film then becomes a deadly game of cat-and-mouse between the intelligent, but ruthless owner and his violent henchmen and the resourceful but terrified group inside the green room.'Green Room' is a solid and well-balanced horror/thriller. It's very dark, meaning the lighting in most of the film's scenes and the tone of the film. Saulnier uses all that darkness and the close quarters in many of those scenes to maximum effect and when he widens his lens or lightens up a scene, it's more of a shock to the system than a relief for the audience. In tone and in some of its content, this movie reminds me a bit of Eli Roth's 2015 cannibal extravaganza 'The Green Inferno', but without the jungle and all that feasting on human flesh (well, mostly without flesh feasting). 'Green Room' doesn't cross over into 'torture porn', but it does have its brutal and bloody scenes. Its jungle is mostly narrow hallways, dark spaces and one very scary green room. Most of the story's tension comes from the psychological torture experienced by a few cornered young people not knowing what's going to happen or what to do next.It's also very entertaining to watch Anton Yelchin, who usually plays innocent, clean-cut and humorous characters (e.g. in the latest 'Star Trek' films and in 2015's charming romantic comedy '5 to 7') and Patrick Stewart, known on screen mostly for his strong, but sensitive leadership (in 'Star Trek: The Next Generation') embrace their inner bad-ass. Unfortunately, a few questionable plot points range from vague to frustratingly nonsensical, but strong acting, effective visuals, a fresh and well-paced story and a consistently dark, foreboding tone mostly make up for the script's few deficiencies. If you appreciate an original, economical and tense horror/thriller, you should make room in your life for some green. 'B+'",7,2,7,4 May 2016
The Danish Girl," 'The Danish Girl' is a very touching, but controversial and oversimplified story.
","'He's comfortable in his own skin,' is usually seen as a compliment. It means that the person in question knows who he (or she) is and is content with that sense of identity. I dare speculate that it's a condition to which we all aspire. Unfortunately, many people around the world lack that inner peace because of a question of gender identity. Regardless of what others think about such an existential situation, people who feel uncomfortable with the biology with which they were born often suffer greatly over this conflict within their hearts and minds. They cannot be comfortable in their own skin, because they don't feel that their skin is really theirs. Before the somewhat more enlightened times of the 21st century, people who identified with a gender other than that to which biology assigned them suffered even more than some do today. In ages past, those people had little opportunity to make changes that would make themselves look on the outside as they felt on the inside. 'The Danish Girl' (R, 2:00) is one such story.Inspired by the true story of early 20th century married Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener, like David Ebershoff's 2000 book on which it's based, 'The Danish Girl' is a fictionalized account of Einar's physical transition to Lili Elbe. Neither the book nor Lucinda Coxon's screenplay makes any claim to absolute historical accuracy. This story changes many of the facts for dramatic purposes. The real-life situation of Lili and Gerda's life was much more complicated than we see on screen. The result is a film that tells a simple story in a way that elicits empathy for the protagonists and enlightens the audience.Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays Einar/Lili, and Alicia Vikander, his wife, Gerda. The couple lives in a large apartment in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they both make a living painting. At first, Einar's landscapes are more in demand and more respected than Gerda's portraits. One day when Gerda was in a hurry to finish a portrait of their mutual friend and ballerina, Oola (Amber Heard), Gerda asks Einar to stand in as a model by putting on Oola's stockings and heels and holding up Oola's dress in front of him. Although the scene is played with a combination of humor and awkwardness, it's obvious that Einar likes the clothes. He starts trying on his wife's clothes which gives birth to an idea. Gerda is a bit conflicted, but being the open-minded person she is, she suggests that her husband dress up as a woman to attend an art world function that he had been trying to avoid. And just like that, Lili is born.The thing is that Einar had always felt like a female and being Lili was the first opportunity that he had really had to express what he felt was his true gender. Einar wears women's clothes and make-up more and more often, both at home and out in public. Lili even begins secretly seeing a local man named Henrik (Ben Whishaw). Gerda is understandably upset by all this, but she never criticizes her husband's inner turmoil or its outward manifestations. She wants to understand, and the more she does, the more she mourns her marriage, which she sees as slipping away. However, as all this is happening, her art career begins to take off. She paints Lili more and more, in fashionable clothes and in little or no clothes. As Gerda's style develops, increasing demand for her paintings soon leads the couple to move to Paris.In Paris, Lili blossoms as a person, even as she seeks a more permanent solution to her feeling that her biology doesn't match her identity. She sees doctors whose diagnoses are wide-ranging, but are mainly focused on Einar/Lili having some sort of mental deficiency. Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenarts), a childhood friend of Einar, tries to help, but he can do little more than offer moral support to the couple. Finally, Lili and Gerda find a possible solution in the person of German doctor Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch). Dr. Warnekros offers to perform practically unprecedented sex reassignment surgery on Lili.'The Danish Girl' is a very sensitive portrayal of a very tumultuous experience in the lives of two real people. Whether you sympathize with the situation of the two main characters or not, you're likely to empathize with them as people. While presenting a story about the controversial topic of gender identity, Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper also tells a very human story within the framework of the movie's plot. At its core, this is a tale of love and loss, of tolerance and devotion, of feeling comfortable in one's own skin. Although some Movie Fans may find some of the situations, images and the brief but graphic nudity (both female and male) to be disturbing, and the plot does drag at times, one of the main reasons to see this movie is for the award-worthy performances by the two leads. With impressive emotional range and depth, both Redmayne and Vikander make this story surprisingly rich and relatable. Hooper draws even more focus (literally) to the characters' feelings by choosing especially significant moments to bring his camera in very close for a tight focus on the characters' faces, while allowing everything beyond their necks to go out of focus. 'The Danish Girl' deserves credit for its honesty, its emotional power and its succinct presentation of a very complicated story. However, some of the changes in the story seem designed to increase the impact of the story, a move I would call emotionally manipulative. For that and other reasons, I just wish that this otherwise excellent film had been more historically accurate. 'B'",6,56,76,21 December 2015
Point Break," The 'Point Break' redeux throws in some great extreme sports scenes in place of much of what made the original film work so well.
","When a movie works, it's due to a combination of great writing, directing, casting, acting, set design, make-up and hairstyling, costuming, lighting, cinematography, visual and sound effects, music and mood, not to mention factors like effective marketing, the timing of the film's release, and even luck and other intangibles that are virtually impossible to predict or control. When enough of those elements produce a film that most people like (or, a few people love), it's like a bit of magic. Trying to duplicate that feat is extremely difficult, yet filmmakers still insist on remaking movies that came out well the first time. Remakes rarely, if ever, recapture that magic of the original film. After a quick IMDb.com search of titles from various genres and decades that have been remade, I found very few remakes which rate higher than their predecessors. I believe that 2015's 'Point Break' (PG-13, 1:53) similarly falls short.In this movie, as in 1991's 'Point Break', a young guy called Johnny Utah goes undercover for the FBI to try identifying and catching a group of mysterious adrenaline junkies committing a string of crimes. But the similarities don't go much farther. Even the title means something different here. Rather than using the phrase as the surfing term that it is, this movie contains dialog that twists it into meaning something more like 'breaking point', as in an individual's personal breaking point. That's because the 2015 update changes the gang that Johnny's investigating from surfers into the most extreme of extreme sports athletes. These guys are supposedly attempting a completely fictional list of extreme sports challenges called the 'Osaki 8'. These 'ordeals', as the script refers to them, have new-age-sounding names like 'Emerging Force', 'Life of Wind' and 'Master of Six Lives' and are supposed to lead to spiritual enlightenment. But who knows if that's true? No one has yet survived all eight parts of the challenge! 2015's 'Point Break' is like the 1991 version on steroids and speed and more adrenaline and whatever else you can think of. Luke Bracey plays Utah, a former high-speed motocross star who left the sport after an especially dangerous ride goes horribly wrong and is now a trainee with the FBI. Delroy Lindo is the instructor who expresses doubts that Utah has what it takes to be an agent. When a small group of daredevils pulls off a series of highly expensive thefts around the world (each heist coupled with a different death-defying stunt), Utah's instructor turns to him for help and sends him undercover to identify and catch the bad guys. Aided by British agent Angelo Pappas (Ray Winstone), Utah catches up with the gang at a huge surfing party off the coast of France. A spiritual rebel called Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez) apparently sees something in the fellow extreme sports enthusiast who just showed up out of nowhere because Bodhi befriends Utah and makes him part of his inner circle, which includes the beautiful and equally spiritual Samsara Dietz (Teresa Palmer). What follows is some very extreme rock climbing, wingsuit flying and snowboarding as Utah tries to prove that this is the gang of criminals that he is pursuing, even as he bonds with the members of Bodhi's group. All the while, the scenery is more beautiful, the stunts are more dangerous, the action is more intense and the plot is more violent than last time. While this movie's visuals are considerably more spectacular than in the original, 2015's 'Point Break' lacks the colorful characters, sense of fun and marginally believable logic of that 1991 version.Some may think it unfair to compare this remake with the movie that inspired it, but 2015's 'Point Break' seems to beg for the comparison. The new version reuses the names of the main characters from the first movie and even recasts one of the original actors (the FBI director who played 'LBJ' in the earlier version). The 2015 film also pays homage to the 1991 film in other ways, such as the inclusion of a surfing scene. That, however, feels more like an obligatory nod to this movie's origins rather than a heartfelt honoring of the original because the remake changes almost everything else about the plot, the characters and their motivations. Without the name 'Point Break' attached to it, this wouldn't be much more than a second-tier action movie, an ungrounded film with little reason to exist on its own.Very little of this 'Point Break' overhaul works. The actors aren't believable in their roles, their characters act inconsistently (and even non-sensically) and the script puts dialog in their mouths which often sounds dumb. Here's one example of that last point: When Utah cautions Bodhi saying 'You're gonna cross a line you can't come back from,' Bodhi responds, 'That's the difference between us. All you see are lines. We see the truth.' To quote another character later in the film, 'What the hell does that even mean?' The only thing that makes this movie special is its fantastic stunts, the impressive cinematography that captures them and the spectacular landscapes in which they take place. Those scenes alone may make the film worth seeing for some Movie Fans, but for most of us, that won't be enough to redeem a remake that's otherwise pretty dumb. I enjoyed those scenes but the main thing they did for me as a reviewer was keep me from giving this movie the lower grade that the rest of the film deserves. Yes, I happen to be a big fan of the original 'Point Break', but even judging the 2015 version completely on its own merits, it falls short of what I would consider a quality action movie.

Creed," 'Creed' is an effective and entertaining passing of the torch for the beloved 'Rocky' franchise.
","Pass the torch. According to thefreedictinoary.com, this oft-used phrase means 'relinquish responsibilities, a tradition, practice, or knowledge to another.' I can hardly think of a better way to express the significance of the boxing drama 'Creed' (PG-13, 2:13). Forty years (almost to the day) from the release of the original 'Rocky', Sylvester Stallone appears in his seventh movie as the character of boxer Rocky Balboa. But it's the first time that the character's name doesn't appear in the title, and the first Rocky movie not written by Stallone, although you'd never guess that just by watching it.The film's title comes from the character of Rocky's rival-turned-friend Apollo Creed (played in the first four Rocky movies by Carl Weathers). The title's use of only the last name signifies the symbolic passing of the torch from that character to his son, Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan). Johnson was the name of Adonis' birth mother (now deceased), with whom Apollo had an extra-marital affair shortly before he died in 'Rocky IV'. Adonis is a Creed by blood and by adoption (having been taken in and raised by Apollo's widow, Mary Anne, played by Phylicia Rashād), but when he decides to follow in his father's footsteps, he keeps his mother's name out of a desire to make his own mark in the boxing world.Adonis wants to be known by the name Johnson, but he wants to fight like a Creed. When his adopted mother refuses to support his dream (for fear of him ending up like his father), Adonis moves to Philadelphia to seek out the man who knows the most about his father as a fighter – the local Philly hero named Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). He finds Rocky lonely (having lost his beloved wife and her older brother and Rocky's best friend, Paulie) and still running his restaurant (Adrienne's). Rocky is surprised to meet Apollo's son, but is reluctant to get back into the boxing game. Adonis is determined and starts working out alone, but Rocky soon comes around to the idea of training the young fighter.Getting Adonis ready for actual fights is no easy task. The young man's only experiences in the ring were little more than bar room brawls in Tijuana, Mexico. He won all those fights, but those opponents were not trained fighters and Adonis had no formal training himself. Adonis' trainer can't get into the ring to even spar with Adonis due to Rocky's age and health problems. Then there's the two-sided coin of one of Adonis' fellow apartment house residents, up-and-coming musician, Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Part encouragement and part distraction, Bianca soon comes to play a significant role in Adonis' life.Lastly, the issue of legacy just won't go away. Adonis is both helped and frustrated by his relationship with Rocky (whom he calls 'uncle'), while being both haunted and encouraged by the memory of the famous father that he never knew. As Adonis prepares for his first real fight against a well-trained local talent and, later, the English fighter who holds the title (real-life fighters Gabe Rosado and Tony Bellew, respectively), Adonis has to struggle with the idea of using his father's name in order to secure bigger fights and a bigger payday. Meanwhile, as is often the case with teacher-student relationships, Rocky, directly passing the torch to Adonis, learns almost as much from his protégé as the other way around.Apart from the story within the film, we see the real-world torch passing metaphor work as we observe Stallone's role in the franchise that he created noticeably diminishing – both on screen and behind the scenes. Just as he hands off the main role to rising star Michael B. Jordan, he has handed off writing and directing duties to Ryan Coogler (who Jordan served very well in 2013's 'Fruitvale Station'). In less talented hands, this transition could have resulted in the dropping of the torch, but Coogler's updating of Stallone's legacy proves effective and entertaining and should appeal to fans of the original Rocky movies as well as fans of both Coogler and Jordan.Coogler and his co-writer, Aaron Covington (with more than a little help from Stallone's outstanding performance), bring the famous character forward with his personality, his attitudes and even his speech patterns remaining remarkably consistent. Jordan makes an excellent younger-generation boxer and the terrific mix of 1970s and 80s Rocky music with new tunes from modern artists Future, Meek Mill and White Dave effectively bridge the gap between the time-honored and the up-to-date. Although some of the dramatic moments in the film felt soft-pedaled, 'Creed' presents a very enjoyable couple of hours in front of the screen and lights the way for a spin-off franchise that may entertain fans of the genre for years to come. Consider the torch passed. 'A-'",8,3,6,27 November 2015
Concussion," 'Concussion' features great acting and an interesting and timely story, but is otherwise unspectacular.
","It's difficult to hear something bad about the ones you love. You don't want to believe it. You don't even want to think about it. But when you do, you worry about how what you've learned will affect the relationship. Well, what if the relationship in question is not with a person, but with an activity? That's the case with many of us football fans when we think about the sad reality of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy). The knowledge that many years of the vicious blows that football players endure (and we cheer) has had long-term health effects on many players, and even ended some of their lives, is a sober realization indeed. It's an uncomfortable truth that fans, players, trainers and coaches at all levels of the game now face. The man who discovered and called attention to the problem – and fought to be heard – is Nigerian-born pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu. 'Concussion' (PG-13, 2:03) is his story.Previous Oscar nominee Will Smith stars as Omalu, who happens to be just about the nicest, most generous person you'd ever want to meet – and one of the smartest. He's the coroner for Allegheny County, the county that includes Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Omalu is qualified enough to be an expert witness in a murder trial, astute enough to get an innocent man acquitted of a murder charge and compassionate enough to speak softly to a corpse before beginning an autopsy, asking the deceased to help him discover what happened to him or her. He's also kind enough to share his limited living space with a recent African immigrant, expecting nothing in return. However, as kind and unassuming as Omalu is, he's also extraordinarily determined – determined to do his job as thoroughly as humanly possible and to right wrongs when he finds them, regardless of any obstacles placed in his path.Omalu is the pathologist on duty when the body of retired Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster (David Morse) is brought in to the morgue, and the good doctor is determined to solve the mystery of this man's death at the age of 50. 'Cardiac arrest may be how he died,' he tells a co-worker, 'but not why.' Omalu ignores the pleas of his boss (Mike O'Malley) not to cut open the local legend and even goes as far as paying out of his own pocket for expensive brain analysis that the chief medical examiner won't authorize. The result of these tests is the discovery of a new brain disease that Omalu names CTE. With the support of his boss' boss (Albert Brooks) and another local expert (Stephen Moyer), he publishes a paper on his study of Webster's brain and the conclusions he reached in a major medical journal. He hopes to trigger further study by fellow scientists and an investigation by the National Football League.Dr. Omalu doesn't quite get the response he was hoping for. Much like the industrialists who likely contributed to global warming and the tobacco companies before them, the NFL flatly denies the science that proved this newly-discovered threat to health and safety. And that's just the beginning. The NFL, the scientific community and even the government work to discredit Omalu and those who help him. He even gets death threats. Omalu responds by publicizing similar findings from autopsies he later does on other former players, meeting with various powerful people and demanding that attention be paid. He receives help from the former Steelers team doctor (Alec Baldwin) and is supported by his new wife (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) every step of the way, but the forces arrayed against him may prove to be just too powerful. Omalu is desperate to be heard by the NFL leadership – people like the new commissioner Roger Goodell (Luke Wilson) and NFL Players' Association executive Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), but the question remains as to who can be more stubborn for longer – the NFL or Dr. Omalu.'Concussion' is an interesting, inspiring and timely film. Smith's portrayal of Omalu, complete with Nigerian accent, is award-worthy. He makes it easy to forget that you're watching Will Smith – not an easy task for such a well-known actor – and he makes us see this story through Dr. Omalu's eyes. Smith's supporting cast is also consistently strong and effective. Peter Landesman's script and direction nicely balance the personal and professional aspects of Omalu's story. The movie provides solid character development which generates empathy from the audience, while giving Movie Fans just enough of the science behind the plot to understand the story, without overindulging in jargon. This film compares most easily to small screen procedurals like 'House' and 'CSI', with a touch of 'Law and Order', but gives us a story and a topic that are even deeper and more relevant. 'Concussion' isn't spectacular, but is entertaining and eye-opening. 'B+'",7,3,9,27 December 2015
Don Jon," 'Don Jon' tried to have fun with the serious problem of sex addiction, but does it very poorly.
","In the same month (September 2013), American movie fans may have noticed the release of two movies about sex addiction. Although it's good to call attention to this very real problem, one of those two movies did it much better than the other. 'Thanks for Sharing' takes the subject seriously and has a good story with appealing characters. And then there's 'Don Jon' (R, 1:30).This film is written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also stars. Jon is a man who cannot get enough sex. He has issues and, as the kids say, he needs tissues for his issues (literally). He brings to bed an endless parade of beautiful women, but still looks at pornography - constantly - even when his latest conquest is sleeping in his bed. He doesn't see a problem with this. He further shows his character's contradictions both as he swears at other drivers while he's rushing to church and as he makes completely insincere confessions in said building.Jon continues unapologetically on this path until he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), who he's convinced is a '10', but who refuses to be his latest one night stand. Jon and Barbara are adorable together, but their constant sexual play and public displays of affection eventually make us feel like voyeurs and border on the disgusting - a word that describes many aspects of this movie. Barbara begins to change Jon's behavior and just might be the one to change his priorities. Or maybe it'll be Esther (Julianne Moore), Jon's college classmate. Or maybe Jon won't change at all.As we wait to see whether Jon accepts that he has a problem and remedy his approach to life and love, we're subjected to Jon and his friends' gross disrespect of women, Jon's obnoxious and dysfunctional family (headed by a very loud, foul-mouthed Tony Danza) along with characters' actions and reactions that don't make sense and are just plain dumb. Helping the audience (especially sex addicts in the audience) see that pornography can never substitute for true intimacy (and can even inhibit it) is a worthy goal, but, in this case, the destination does not justify the journey.So, to sum up, we have a dumb script, disgusting displays, dysfunction and disrespect. Hmm. That's a lot of Ds in my review of 'Don Jon'. I guess one more won't hurt. This movie's grade also starts with a 'D'.",1,3,7,6 October 2015
Deadpool 2," not quite as fresh and effortlessly entertaining as the original, but still pretty damn fun!
","'Deadpool 2' (R, 1:59) is a superhero action-adventure comedy, which is a sequel to 2016's boundary-shattering 'Deadpool'. This is the 11th of the X-Men films. Although Marvel Comics properties, neither the X-Men or Deadpool films are considered part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This one was written by returning scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, but this time with help from franchise star Ryan Reynolds. Version 2.0 has a different director, David Leitch ('Atomic Blonde', 'John Wick'), after original director Tim Miller left the project due to 'mutual creative differences' with Reynolds.Much like the original, the sequel has plenty of sarcasm, inuendo, social political satire, meta humor, 4th wall breaking... and bloody violence. Fan favorite characters are back too! The titular 'merch with the mouth' remains devoted to his one true love, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), is still friends with his former roommate, Blind Al (Leslie Uggams), and continues to receive support from his best friend, Weasel (T.J. Miller), and favorite cab driver, Dopinder (Karan Soni), while still being frenemies with X-'Men' Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). D2, however, has more heart, as Mr. Pool's capacity for love and self-sacrifice extend beyond his relationship with Vanessa and he begins playing nice with others... kind of. Well, some early narration does refer to this as 'a family movie', so...After a shocking tragedy early in the film (so early that the opening credits get all meta with it), Wade Wilson / Deadpool is acting darker than usual. Colossus and NTW take Wade to the X-Mansion and try to break him out of his funk by getting him involved in X-Men business. When they take him to a mutant rehab facility to try talking down an overweight mutant teen named Russell (Julian Dennison) who is threatening violence against the facility's manager (Eddie Marsan), the way Wade handles the situation drives a fresh wedge between him and the X-Men. Wade decides that Russell needs his protection (and that Wade himself needs to do some protecting), so he forms a paramilitary mutant group that he calls X-Force. This puts him, and new recruits like Domino (Zazie Beetz), Zeitgeist (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) and Bedlam (Terry Crews), up against a huge mutant called Juggernaut and a another known as Cable (Josh Brolin) who has come from the future for the sole purpose of killing Russell. Yeah, there's a lot going on here.'Deadpool 2' would be a blockbuster if it were the first in the series, but can't quite match the original. Well how could it? 2016's 'Deadpool' was a shock to the system, a real game changer. This one keeps in place the attitude and the actors which made the first one so popular and expands the title character's world to give us more to look at, but the sequel isn't as fresh and effortlessly entertaining as the original. D2 may be a little bit less slick than its predecessor, but in and of itself, it's still a damn good time. 'A-'",8,4,10,19 May 2018
Youth," Youth is fleeting, but 'Youth' will stay with you for a long time.
","'Youth is wasted on the young.' That quote from award-winning Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw means different things to different people, fittingly, depending on a person's age. Young people may see it as just another example of being dismissed by the older generation. Older people may take the quote to mean that their mature understanding of how best to enjoy life would have done them more good in a youthful body with their entire lives ahead of them. If you think about it, the quote praises both youth and maturity. Such is also the case within the English language Italian comedy-drama 'Youth' (R, 2:04).Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel star as Fred Ballinger and Mick Boyle, two men who have been friends since they were young adults and now, in their late 70s, are vacationing at a luxurious Swiss resort hotel. For Mick, this is a working vacation. He's a legendary screenwriter and director who is spending his time at the resort working with a few young screenwriters on what he hopes will be his last great film. He's writing the film for his frequent star, Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda), and wants it to be his 'testament' to life. Fred is a renowned classical music composer and conductor who has left his music career behind him and repeatedly refuses the requests and pleas from Queen Elizabeth II's emissary for a command performance for Prince Philip's birthday. Fred does little more than exist, try to remember the past, and wait for his days to end. Fred's assistant/daughter, Lena (Rachel Weisz), does her best to keep her father healthy and motivated, but she's harboring some old grudges – and has other problems to deal with too.Throughout this film, we see the concept of youth from both sides – those who still have it and those who had it long ago and see the world differently in their maturity. Fred and Mick have conversations about getting older (increased wisdom and perspective, reduced memory and satisfactory urination, etc.), but also try to pass on some of that wisdom to their children and struggle to come to terms with some of the mistakes they made in their own youth. They also observe the other guests, both famous and anonymous, even as some of those same guests observe them right back. There's the older couple who eat dinner together every night but never speak, a Buddhist monk, the obese but still popular former soccer star (Roly Serrano), a young but wise and ambitious masseuse (Luna Zimic Mijovic), the small boy (Leo Artin) who Fred hears playing one of his old compositions on the violin, the vacationing Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea) and the hot young actor (Paul Dano) researching a new role.'Youth' is the kind of movie that some may dismiss as 'artsy', but I call engaging and insightful. The wide variety of interesting minor characters, combined with the big developments in the lives of the major characters make for a unusual storytelling (somewhat reminiscent of 2014's award-winning 'Birdman'), but it's a plot that holds the audience's attention and pays off with some very surprising (and even shocking) moments. Along the way, we're treated to a couple realistic and beautifully shot dream sequences and plenty of great scenery, courtesy of the Swiss Alps. Not to mention a look at other kinds of beauty, owing to the fact that this movie takes place in a resort – slash – spa, with traditional (ahem) European sensibilities. And, of course, with three Oscar winners, an Oscar nominee and a Golden Globe nominee in the cast, the performances are as impeccable as you would expect. After all that, what we're left with is an eloquent meditation on youth, an earnest celebration of maturity and a subtle challenge to never let go of your passions. Youth can't be held forever, but the joys of the film 'Youth' can last quite a while. 'A-'",8,1,3,26 December 2015
Ready Player One," too much of a good thing
","'Ready Player One' is a science fiction action-adventure directed and produced by Oscar winner Steven Spielberg and written by Zak Penn ('The Avengers'), Eric Eason ('A Better Life') and Ernest Cline, based on Cline's own 2011 debut novel of the same name. The movie is heralded as the 'E.T.' director's return to his sci-fi and youth-centered movie roots after a series of historically-based projects. The plot and its various other elements, make 'Ready Player One' feel like a frenetic, 1980s-inspired, youth-obsessed combination of 'Tron', 'Avatar', 'Guardians of the Galaxy' & 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. The main character is Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), an orphaned teen who lives in 'the stacks', towers of mobile homes on stilts in Columbus, Ohio, the most populous city in the severely over-populated country. Like Wade, it seems that everyone escapes the depressing and dilapidated world around them by spending most of their days in a virtual reality world known as the OASIS. The OASIS was created by tech genius James Halliday (Oscar winner Mark Rylance) as an escape from his own crippling shyness.As the movie opens, Halliday is deceased, but before he died, he created a game within the OASIS, which offers any user the opportunity to unravel a complex set of clues and accumulate three keys which would give that person complete control of the OASIS and control of Halliday's company - and its assets. Of course, winning this game is the goal of everyone - individuals and corporations. Innovative Online Industries (IOI), headquartered in Columbus and led by the obsessive CEO Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), has hired a virtual army of tech experts & online gamers to ensure IOI comes out on top. Wade is as obsessed with Halliday as Sorrento is with gaining control of the OASIS, but like Sorrento, Wade won't be able to win this high-stakes game alone. In the game, Wade is known as Parzival, an avatar which, like that of most other people, is better-looking, more confident, more able and more powerful than Wade is in real life. Early in his quest, Parzival meets and becomes attracted to Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), who likes him too, but has even more personal reasons for wanting to win the contest.The two end up becoming part of the 'High Five', which also includes Sho (Philip Zhao), Daito (Win Morisaki) and Wade's best friend in the game, Aech (Lena Waithe). While simultaneously competing against each other and working together, this scrappy group must navigate a maze of clues based on Halliday's personal life, including his former partnership with Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) - and a seemingly infinite stream of 1980s pop culture references (music, fictional characters and movies like 'Back to the Future' - to beat Sorrento and his main henchman, i-R0k (T.J. Miller) to the ultimate prize. 'Ready Player One' is fun, exciting, creative... and mind-numbing. The CGI's impressive... in a sensory overload way. The plot's good but can be hard to follow for non-gamers. Too much of a good thing. 'B-'",5,0,1,30 March 2018
The Hateful Eight," 'The Hateful Eight' is vintage Tarantino, but more grounded and accessible than most of his films.
","Sometimes the experience of seeing a movie is best described as an 'event'. I'm not talking about the massive crowds or fans wearing costumes to the theater, ala 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. I'm talking about a filmmaker designing everything concerning his movie to be special. Love him or hate him, this is exactly what Quentin Tarantino did with 'The Hateful Eight' (R, 2:47). This project was so special to him that when a draft of the script leaked out, he announced that he'd write the story as a novel, but not make it into a film, changing his mind only after an L.A. reading of the draft script went extremely well and Tarantino was convinced by Samuel L. Jackson himself. When the writer-director-producer got production back on track, he seemed to embrace the credo 'Go big or go home.' Tarantino shot the movie with old-style 70mm film stock and made sure that 100 theaters in 46 cities across the U.S. had or reinstalled old-school movie projectors that could show the film as intended. The December 25, 2015 release in those cities was a 'roadshow presentation', a release template rarely used since the 1960s. This roadshow involved the distribution of souvenir programs about the movie, showing a somewhat longer version of the film (187 minutes, including an overture and an intermission) and shown, of course, 'in Ultra Panavision 70'! If you weren't able to get to a roadshow presentation of the film, you can still appreciate its stunning western vistas on screen in a somewhat abbreviated 167 minute version, complete with new (and some older, previously unused) music by the legendary Ennio Morricone, scoring his first western in 40 years! Of course, all this begs the question of whether this film is worthy of all these special production and release arrangements The film is divided into six 'chapters', each beginning with a black title card with white letters, as it tells the story of eight mysterious characters trapped by a blizzard in 1870s Wyoming. As the movie opens, bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) is riding in a stagecoach, chained to Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), on whose head is a $10,000 price tag. Ruth likes to bring in his human prizes alive so he can give the local hangman some business – and watch them hang. Fellow bounty hunter, Civil War veteran Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), does things quite differently.When Ruth's stage comes upon Warren standing in the road beside three corpses, Warren asks the driver, O.B. Jackson (James Parks), if he has 'room for one more', O.B. defers to Ruth who recognizes Warren and welcomes him, along with his 'luggage'. A short time later, they come across another man on foot, with a blizzard approaching. Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins) says that his horse broke a leg as he was riding to Red Rock to be sworn in as the new sheriff. Ruth doubts that story and Warren isn't happy that Mannix turns out to be an unrepentant Confederate, but Mannix convinces the men to allow him to ride with them.With the winter weather worsening, the stage stops at Minnie's Haberdashery where the passengers and their driver can rest and get something to eat and drink while they wait out the storm. There are four other men inside Minnie's – Confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), British gentleman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) who introduces himself as a traveling hangman, quiet cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and 'Bob the Mexican' (Demián Bichir) who explains that Minnie left him in charge of the haberdashery while she went to visit her mother. Ruth is uncomfortable with these strangers and is concerned about someone trying to prevent him from getting to Red Rock and collecting his bounty on Domergue. He expresses his instinct that at least one of Minnie's guests 'is not who he says he is'.Ruth's not wrong. The questions for us, as audience members, are figuring out who – and how many of these characters are misrepresenting themselves – and why. We try to figure out the answers as we watch the people on screen doing the same thing – and trying to get along well enough to survive the storm, in spite of their conflicting agendas and prejudices. Then, just when things inside that cold cabin really start to heat up, Tarantino pulls the bear skin rug out from underneath everyone. After Chapters One through Four tell us a chronological story, Chapter Five show us what happened early that day, then the Last Chapter picks up the action where we left it – for the intense and predictably violent conclusion.'The Hateful Eight' is vintage Tarantino, but more accessible than most of his films. For example, like his previous film, 2012's 'Django Unchained', this one takes place in the 19th century, deals with the ugly results of slavery, gives the black man a chance for some payback and even incorporates the character of a well-spoken European gentleman. Unlike most of Tarantino's films, however, almost all of the violence is saved for the last half of the film (but when it starts, it's as bloody as you'd expect), and this movie tells a story that's more linear than 'Pulp Fiction' and based on a scenario that's more realistic than 'Inglourious Basterds'. The screenplay is smart and has some funny moments. The dialog is a pleasure to hear (if you're not bothered by Tarantino's well-known liberal use of profanity, including the n-word). The film's excellent performances sell the story – and entertain wonderfully. All this, topped off with Morricone's magnificent score, the spectacular scenery and cinematography which captures it, make this film an experience – nay, an event not to be missed.

Moana," 'Moana' is one of the best animated movies of 2016!
","'Moana' is the Polynesian word for 'ocean'. And that's only the beginning of the cultural and historical connections between Polynesia and Walt Disney Animation Studios' 'Moana' (PG, 1:43). After a lengthy, worldwide talent search, the job of voicing the title character went to Hawaiian native Auli'i Cravalho, who then became, at the age of 14, the youngest person ever to voice a Disney princess character. Her co-star, Dwayne Johnson, also of Polynesian (Samoan) descent, plays a character based on a major figure of the same name from Polynesian legend. Cravalho and Johnson are joined by Troy Polamalu, the former NFL Pro Bowl player, who also has Samoan ancestry and voiced one of the villagers. Besides casting these and other actors of Polynesian blood, Disney developed this movie by sending co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker on tours of the South Pacific in order to make sure the film accurately and respectfully portrayed the look and culture of Polynesia. Of course, this is all within the context of a Disney animated feature film which, in my opinion, has turned out to be the studio's best in years.Moana Waialiki (Cravalho) is the daughter of the chief of a small topical island called Motunui. She grew up hearing legends about the origins of her world and the water which surrounds it and always felt drawn to the ocean. It's an attraction that her father, Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison), won't allow her to indulge, fearing for her safety, while Moana's Gramma Tala (Rachel House) urges her to be who she is meant to be. When a mysterious plague starts killing the fish and vegetation on which her people depend, Moana feels compelled to follow the example of her wayfinding ancestors and make a journey across the ocean in search of a legendary remedy – and she is convinced that the ocean has chosen her.Moana is sailing off in search of the legendary shape-shifting demigod, Maui (Johnson), who helped create this world by pulling the islands up out of the ocean with his large, magical fishhook and by controlling the son to lengthen the day. But he also stole a beautiful green gem stone – the heart of the island goddess, Te Fiti. The lava demon, Te Ka, then attacked Maui, causing him to lose the stone, as well as his fishhook and end up stranded on a remote island for 1,000 years. When Moana lands there, Maui believes the gods have sent him the boat to end his exile. Maui is a very arrogant, self-assured demigod and has no interest in helping this young island girl to save the world from the plague – which he caused.Convincing Maui to travel with her to put back Te Fiti's heart (which the ocean itself has graciously but insistently brought back up) is only the first of Moana's challenges with Maui at her side. Moana knows nothing about seafaring, so Maui has to teach her. So Maui can utilize all his powers, Moana has to help him retrieve his magic fishhook, a task that involves making it through some place called the Realm of the Monsters. Then they have to fend off an attack from cute, but nasty coconut pirates which look and act like a cross between the Minions from the 'Despicable Me' movies and Immortan Joe's army in 'Mad Max: Fury Road' – on the high seas. If our heroes survive all that (and crossing the ocean on a glorified raft), there's the issue of getting past Te Ka so they can put back Te Fiti's heart. Simple, right? 'Moana' is a highly entertaining and edifying journey. Although the character of Moana and her mission are Disney inventions, the heart of the story is the rich and exotic culture of the Polynesian people of the South Sea islands. Moana is a tough and determined but vulnerable and adorable combination of previous Disney heroines like Merida from 'Brave', Ariel from 'The Little Mermaid', Rapunzel from 'Tangled', Anna from 'Frozen' and Mulan from 'Mulan'. (However, the adventure that accompanies Moana's mission and the character of Maui will likely make this movie popular with the boys too.) Of course, a Disney princess (or, 'Chief's daughter' as Moana prefers) needs a sidekick and she has a bug-eyed, none-too-bright pet rooster named Heihei for company and substantial comic relief.The film features computer animation, mainly to enhance the look of the ocean on screen (the water – and the entire film – are gorgeous!), but there are also some hand-drawn images nested within the movie – in the form of Maui's tattoos, which move on their own, illustrating scenes from his life and giving him advice. Then there's the wonderful original music – much of it by none other than 'Hamilton' auteur Lin-Manuel Miranda (hired for this job even before his revolutionary musical take on American history took Broadway by storm) – and Dwayne Johnson sings some of Miranda's composition! Last but not least, the film is bookended by the clever animated short 'Inner Workings' – and a very funny post-credits shout-out to the directors' 1989 film 'The Little Mermaid'. 'Moana' is not to be missed! 'A'",9,11,29,1 December 2016
The Book Thief," 'The Book Thief' stole over two hours of my time and gave me precious little in return.
","'The Book Thief' (PG-13, 2:11) is one of those movies whose title tells you very little about the film, so allow me to fill you in. It's the story of life in Hitler's Germany, as seen through the eyes of a pretty and self-assured blonde tween named Liesel (Sophie Nelisse). She is 'The Book Thief'. Even though she doesn't know how to read, she takes a book that she sees someone drop on the ground. When she finally learns to read, the book thievery increases. She takes a book from a houseguest and later breaks into the local mayor's home (repeatedly) to avail herself of his large personal library. Of course, she refers to her activities as 'borrowing'.After Liesel is, for her protection, given up by her communist mother, she is raised by a childless middle-aged couple (played by Oscar-nominee Emily Watson and Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush) in a small German town. Liesel's new mother is harsh but is hiding a big heart under her gruff exterior, while Liesel's new father is kind and nurturing. He teaches her to read, and a young man who comes to hide in their home (for reasons you can probably guess) teaches her to express herself. Meanwhile, Liesel forms a close friendship with a cocky, but sweet neighbor boy. Even as the world around her seems to become more dangerous and make less sense by the day, Liesel's love of learning , her growing creativity and the support of those around her carry her through.After so many movies about Nazi Germany, I give this film credit for its realism and unusual focus. The restrictions, bigotry, fear and paranoia bred by the Nazis is treated as a simple matter-of-fact, giving us insight into what life was like for average Germans during World War II, and why they tolerated it. The film features a girl who really wants to read (good), but shows her stealing without consequences (not so good) and it's inexplicably narrated by Death (as in the Grim Reaper). The story is fairly interesting and the set decoration is great, but if you're interested in how the Nazi regime affected the lives of its people, I'd recommend 1993's 'Swing Kids' (with a young Christian Bale) or 2008's heartbreaking 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas'. 'The Book Thief' is too long as it tells a story that is only barely worthy of telling. 'C'",3,3,4,10 December 2015
Doctor Strange," 'Doctor Strange' magnificently raises the bar and expands the horizon for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
","The wild superhero action-adventure-fantasy film 'Doctor Strange' (PG-13, 1:55) does for the Marvel Cinematic Universe what the character did for Marvel Comics when he first appeared in 1963 – make a universe into a multiverse. When Marvel artist Steve Ditko brought his idea to his Spider-Man co-creator, writer Stan Lee, according to Ditko, it was 'a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics'. The film connects Strange's new world to previous Marvel stories this way: 'Heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers. We safeguard it against more mystical threats.' The story in this vibrant and visually remarkable film starts ordinarily enough. Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange (Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch) is a supremely talented neurosurgeon, with the ego to match. (Think of him as an even better, but only slightly more charming version of TV's 'House'.) He has an emotional attachment to fellow surgeon Dr. Christie Palmer (Oscar nominee Rachel McAdams), whom he respects only slightly more than rivals like Dr. Nicodemus West (the underrated Michael Stuhlbarg), whom he doesn't hesitate to publicly embarrass. Driving to a dinner, Strange's Lamborghini tumbles down a hillside and his life comes crashing down with it. Still in charge of his faculties and in possession of all his appendages, he nevertheless suffers devastating hand injuries which effectively ends his surgical career. He searches in vain for a medical solution, becoming even more self-absorbed as he does so. When Strange learns about and tracks down a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who completely recovered from a similarly devastating injury, Strange learns about a place of healing called Kamar-Taj, near Katmandu, Nepal, and literally spends his last dollar to get himself there.Kamar-Taj is a mysterious complex run by The Anicent One (Oscar winner Tilda Swinton) – and is nothing like Strange expected. The Anicent One thinks that Strange is too arrogant to bother with, but she is convinced by one of her followers called Karl Mordo (Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor) to let the rude but desperate doctor stay. She convinces him to look beyond his current reality by thrusting his spirit out of his body and into, as pluggedin.com wonderfully described it, 'hurtling through unimagined realms, galaxies and dimensions. He flies through the universe and finds another and another. He spins through time and matter - soaked in color, drenched in image, places pregnant with beauty and horror.' Strange begs to be taught and he progresses quickly, becoming a talented student of the mystic arts. But The Anicent One struggles to teach him 'the simplest and most significant lesson of all... It's not about you.' There's definitely something much, much bigger than Strange's problems for Kamar-Taj to contend with. A former master sorcerer called Kaecilius (TV's 'Hannibal', Mads Mikkelsen) has stolen pages from one of The Ancient One's secret books of rituals and plans to use the spell to summon the supremely powerful Dormammu from The Dark Dimension in order to remake the natural world and give everyone in it eternal life. The Ancient One, Mordo and Wong (Benedict Wong), the Kamar-Taj librarian, all warn Strange about the danger posed by Kaecilius and Dormammu – and they try to keep Strange from experimenting with powers that he doesn't yet understand – but the newly self-assured sorcerer has to learn all those lessons for himself – while his own life and the fate of our world hangs in the balance.Like 'Deadpool' earlier in 2016, 'Doctor Strange' raises the already high bar for MCU films. The story is fresh, interesting and transports us to new worlds which excite the imagination. The visual effects are simply amazing and the score is terrific. The sights and sounds of the first sequence alone are worth the price of admission, but we get a full two hours of remarkable creativity and outstanding entertainment. (And make sure you stick around for the fun mid-credits scene and the game-changing post-credits confrontation.) Some have criticized the film's changes from the comics and/or the extreme efforts to be politically correct in this movie's casting, but the story works very well, and the cast is pitch perfect – Cumberbatch in particular. Others complain that the visuals are too close to 2010's 'Inception', but they are completely in service to the story and take visual effects to the next level. My only criticism involves a slight overuse of slapstick as comic relief, but that's a subjective and very minor issue, considering how good the movie is overall. In the film, The Ancient One expands the title character's perception of reality, as the movie does for the audience, by telling her newest student, 'You think you know how the world works. You think this material universe is all there is. What if I told you the reality you know is one of many?' What if indeed. 'A'",9,4,8,4 November 2016
Lion," 'Lion' is an emotionally-engaging and fascinating true story that is not to be missed.
","We all have a family. You may live with the family of your birth, with a family which adopted you or with a family that you have made through getting married and having children. It doesn't matter which. You have a family. Since we can all relate to having family, it also follows that we can all understand what it means to be separated from family. And you can probably imagine what it would be like to have a family that is lost to you, to desperately desire a reunion, but be unable to make it happen. A person in that situation may become part of another family, even one that is full of love, but still never stop thinking of his original family. That's what the main character is facing in the Australian-produced drama 'Lion' (PG-13, 1:58).The film is based on the true story of Indian-born Australian businessman Saroo Brierley, as told in his 2014 book 'A Long Way Home'. As a 5-year-old, Saroo was abandoned by his older brother in a train station near his home in central India. Saroo wandered onto another train where he got locked in one of the unoccupied cars and was unable to get out until the train stopped for good in Calcutta, over 900 miles from his home. Saroo couldn't tell the authorities enough about his hometown or his family for them to help him find his way back home, so he was declared 'lost' and put up for adoption. He was soon adopted by John and Sue Brierley, an upper middle class couple who lived on the southeastern Australian island of Tasmania. It was there that he grew up as a member of a happy family. When he became an adult, he began thinking more about his family in India and how they must still wonder what happened to him – and if he's even still alive – if they are still alive themselves. He began using satellite images from Google Earth to look at train stations he might have passed through 25 years earlier – and desperately hoping to match something in those images with any of the details he could still remember.That was the bare bones of Saroo's factual story, and here's how it plays out in the film 'Lion': Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is a happy 5-year-old from a poor family living in a neighborhood of the city of Khandwa, India. Saroo's mother, Kamla (Priyanka Bose), is a single parent who works moving rocks at construction sites, in order to feed Saroo, his younger sister and their teenage brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate). Saroo is very close to Guddu, following him everywhere. Guddu tries to help his mother by stealing and selling coal from passing trains and Saroo helps. When Guddu announces late one night that he's going to take the train to a nearby city to get temporary work moving bales of hay, Saroo convinces Guddu to let him come along. When the boys arrive at their destination and get off the train, Saroo is so tired that Guddu lays him down on a bench to sleep while Guddu goes to see about the job. Before Guddu can get back, Saroo wakes up and, looking for his brother, wanders onto another train, but gets locked inside one of the cars. This train doesn't make all of its usual stops and Saroo is unable to get off or get help.Saroo ends up in Calcutta (now known as Kolkata), on the other side of India. Saroo is so far from home that the locals speak a different dialect than he does. Even with the help of a translator, Saroo can't tell anyone exactly where he is from and can only identify his mother as 'mum'. After living with other homeless children in or near the Calcutta train station for a few days and escaping some potentially dangerous situations in the city, he ends up in a center for missing children. After exhausting every effort to find where Saroo belongs, the center allows him to be adopted by Sue Brierley (Oscar winner Nicole Kidman) and her husband, John (David Wenham). John and Sue are loving parents who soon also adopt another Indian boy named Mantosh. As an adult, Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) begins a search for his original family. He doesn't want to hurt the Brierleys, but he agonizes over what the past 25 years must have been like for his Indian family, especially for his birth mother and for Guddu. As Saroo prepares for a career in hotel management, he falls in love with a classmate named Lucy (multiple Oscar nominee Rooney Mara), who is sympathetic to Saroo's emotional need to find his family, but is frustrated by Saroo's growing obsession with a search that has little chance of success. Understanding that he is looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack and is distancing himself from those closest to him, he still cannot stop searching for answers to who he is – and to find the family who loved him first.'Lion' is a fascinating, emotional and very entertaining film. It showed more of Saroo's life in India than I would've expected and it sometimes seems like a bit much, but it's that background that gives this film its emotional heart. It's also helpful that most of the story is told chronologically, with flashbacks used only sparingly and for surprising reveals. The film's ending won't be a surprise to anyone familiar with the story, but it still makes for the most emotional 5-10 minutes in recent cinematic memory. And the last few shots and information revealed during the closing credits are both surprising and satisfying. With such an emotionally engaging story so well told and so well-acted, 'Lion' is not to be missed. 'A'",9,1,3,31 December 2016
The Lost City of Z," 'The Lost City of Z' is a slow-moving, but engaging historical epic.
","Percival Harrison Fawcett. Probably the most famous explorer you've never heard of. A more recent explorer (from only about 100 years ago) than those we learned about in school, he was in search of some of the same places as the explorers of old. Fawcett, a British army officer who had studied geography and cartography, became obsessed with the search for an ancient Amazonian city that he called 'Z'. 16th century explorers called it 'El Dorado', a mythical city of gold which is said to have existed deep in the jungle of present-day Brazil. The Spanish conquistadors searched for El Dorado, as did the famed English explorer and 'New World' colonizer Sir Walter Raleigh. In a tragic irony of history, the Europeans' diseases (to which the natives had no immunity) probably wiped out the indigenous civilization for which they searched. Over three centuries later, Fawcett was looking for the remains of ancient peoples in the Amazon – not to find riches, but rather, to add to the 'civilized' world's understanding of and appreciation for the peoples that most of his contemporaries still referred to as 'savages'. Fawcett's expeditions deep into the jungles of central South America inspired the creation of fictional characters ranging from Sherlock Holmes' creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger (in his 1912 novel 'The Lost World', about dinosaurs living in the Amazon basin) to George Lucas' Indiana Jones (portrayed by Harrison Ford in several movies directed by Steven Spielberg). In 2005, David Grann, a staff writer for 'The New Yorker', personally visited a native tribe in the Amazon researching Fawcett's expeditions. Grann turned his resulting article into an award-winning best-selling 2009 book which, in turn, became the 2017 film of the same name, 'The Lost City of Z' (PG-13, 2:21).Major Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam, from TV's 'Sons of Anarchy') is a good man with a complicated family situation. He's unable to earn his due credit in his career in the British Army because, as one so-called 'gentleman' puts it, 'He's been rather unfortunate in his choice of ancestors,' which is a reference to the character of Fawcett's late father. Percy is also the head of his own growing family (yes, head of the household – it's 1906, after all). His wife, Nina (Sienna Miller) is an independent-minded woman (especially for her time) and Percy respects her, but her desire to become involved with her husband's career is rebuffed (by Percy and others) on account of her gender. Nina is relegated to the role of primary caregiver of their growing family, including their son, Jack (and, later, Brian and Joan). Nina values her role, but it's harder due to Percy's lengthy absences, which cause resentment from Jack (once, as a boy, asking, 'Are you my father?' and, later, as a teen, proclaiming his hatred of his dad).After completing the latest of his postings outside of England proper, he is called home for a special mission. The Royal Geographic Society wants him to draw upon his earlier training as a surveyor to go into the Amazon and help settle a border dispute between Brazil and Bolivia. A successful mission could help avoid a war between those two countries, help insure the continued success of his country's rubber trade in the region, bring him some decorations for his unadorned uniform and help restore honor to his family name. In short, the RGS makes him an offer that he can't refuse. And, even though it means going into a dangerous place (what with the lack of personnel support, uncharted terrain, harsh jungle conditions, diseases, wild animals and unfriendly natives) and being away from his family for two or three years (IF he even comes back), Percy accepts the assignment and Nina supports him doing so.While in the jungle, Percy's native guide tells him about an ancient city that he says is nearby. With the help of fellow (and more experienced) explorer Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson) and other members of his party (including one named Arthur, played by Edward Ashley), Percy completes his assigned mission – and also finds well-made pieces of ancient pottery. Percy returns home to a hero's welcome, but he quickly alienates the scientific community which was cheering him on when he makes a speech proclaiming that he was close to finding evidence of a sophisticated Native American civilization that may predate their own. But then, with the support (and company) of a wealthy gentleman named James Murray (Angus Macfadyen), who fancies himself an explorer, Percy, Henry and Arthur head back to South America. A combination of run-ins with the natives, Murray's lack of intestinal fortitude, the beginning of World War I and other factors complicate and delay Percy realizing his ultimate goal, but he keeps trying and is ultimately joined by his son, Jack (played as a young man by Tom Holland). And then my summary ends. I'll reveal none of the movie's surprises. For the rest of the story, you can read up on the history of Percival Fawcett and his search, or, better yet, see the film. Here's why you should 'The Lost City of Z' is a slow-moving, but engaging historical epic. Little-known writer/director James Gray ('The Immigrant', 'We Own the Night', 'Little Odessa') tells this little-known story very well. He does a great job of humanizing Fawcett's adventures and distilling them to their most important elements, creating an enlightening and entertaining film in the process. Gray also lays out the plot in a way that makes it relevant to current social and political issues, without preaching. Strong performances by Hunnam, Miller and the rest of the cast help Gray's cause. The film's energy sometimes wanes, but the journey is worth your time. 'B+'",7,1,2,21 April 2017
American Hustle," 'American Hustle' has a lot of fun with a true story and makes us want to sing along.
","According to Wikipedia, '.ABSCAM was a United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation run from the FBI's Hauppauge, Long Island office in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The operation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property but was converted to a public corruption investigation.' That investigation and its results form the basis for 2013's 'American Hustle' (R, 2:18). But the film is only loosely based on the real-life story. The first thing on screen are the words: 'Some of this actually happened.' 'American Hustle' stars Christian Bale as con man Irving Rosenfeld and Amy Adams as his girlfriend and partner-in-crime Sydney Prosser. Irving is running a small-time loan scam on New Jersey locals and doing pretty well, but business really takes off when Sydney gets involved, puts on a high-class British accent, starts calling herself Edith and portrays herself as well-connected with the banks in London. Personally and professionally, things go swimmingly for the pair, until they run into Bradley Cooper's FBI agent, Richie DiMaso, who entraps Irving and Sydney/Edith, and then forces them to work for him. As in real life, the undercover activities shift from targeting criminals to targeting politicians (trying to get them to take bribes).That's about all of the similarities between 'American Hustle' and ABSCAM. Director David O. Russell (who also directed Oscar-winners 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'The Fighter' and brings together the best actors from each of those movies to this one) focuses his film on the fictional characters that he created along with co-writer Eric Singer. This allows the movie to have some fun with both the characters and the story. As Sydney/Edith says in a bit of narration referring to something she did early in the film, 'There was a boldness about it. I didn't know where that boldness would take me, but I was gonna find out.' That quote also sums up my feelings as I watched this movie.Russell populates his story with a variety of colorful characters. Irving has a pot belly and an epic comb-over, but as Sydney says in a bit of narration, 'There was a confidence that drew me to him.' Irving's attitude is summed up with his quote: 'We're all conning ourselves, in one way or another, just to get through life.' Edith (who distracts her marks – and the audience members – with her revealing outfits) shows quite the aptitude for the con games they're playing, and she's a lot more comfortable than Irving with the higher-stakes stings that they're helping the FBI run. Meanwhile, Camden, New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) seems well-meaning and gets things done, but isn't completely ethical in achieving those results.Given the time period and the tone and style of this film, pretty early on it reminded me of a combination of two great 90s movies which also told stories set in the late 70s and early 80s - 'Boogie Nights' and 'Goodfellas'. Then, when a song from the former showed up in this soundtrack and a major cast member from the latter showed up on the screen, the parallels felt even stronger. And, as 'American Hustle' progressed, I also saw elements of 'The Grifters' and 'The Firm', two more excellent 90s films.As with those movies, in 'American Hustle', it's both fun and interesting to guess who's playing whom and how all the characters are going to fare when the story has run its course. It's also interesting to see whether the use of a phony Arab sheik (Michael Pena, playing a Mexican-American FBI agent playing a sheik) helps or hurts the cause, and how Irving's crazy wife (Jennifer Lawrence) plays into the equation. (Yes, he's married, even though he's @#$%ing Sydney). Throughout the film, and especially when they finally meet each other, Adams' and Lawrence's characters seem to be competing for the title of 'Craziest Bitch in This Here Movie'.'American Hustle' features a smart and funny script, along with several award-worthy performances from basically every actor mentioned in this review. The soundtrack and use of music in this film are also pretty great! I loved the old, familiar songs, but I also heard a non-English version of 'White Rabbit', and thoroughly enjoyed the short scene in which Jennifer Lawrence cleans her house while rocking out to the James Bond anthem 'Live and Let Die'! If you appreciate great acting and like an entertaining story, you really should, regardless of whether you're an American, hustle on over to your computer and find this movie.

The Revenant," 'The Revenant' has greatness within it, but is not a great film as a whole.
","Sometimes two movies come out at the same time and share a lot of elements even though they're completely unrelated. For example, the parallels between two films which both came out in limited release on December 25, 2015 (even though one went into wide release before the other) are striking. I'm referring to 'The Hateful Eight' and 'The Revenant' (R, 2:36).Both movies take place in the 19th century American west, are set completely in the wilderness and include a lot of snow. In both films, men die by shootings and stabbings, women are abused and even killed, someone takes a drink and ends up spitting out blood, at one point, there's a naked man wandering in the cold and, later on, someone is hanged. Each movie even contains a brief scene in which someone catches snowflakes with the tongue. I could go on, but suffice it to say there's an unusual number of similarities between these two films, considering how different they are. While 'The Hateful Eight' is a completely fictional tale with multi-layered characters, an interesting story and even some light-hearted moments, 'The Revenant' is an even simpler story, which is mainly about one man, and is dead serious – and even semi-fictional.'The Revenant' is the film adaptation of Michael Punke's 2002 novel of the same name, which is inspired by a true story. The book takes some liberties with the truth. The film takes even more. The truth in the story is that, in 1823, fur trapper Hugh Glass was attacked by a grizzly bear and left for dead by his companions, but, having been abandoned, he still managed to limp, shuffle and crawl over 200 miles to Fort Kiowa in present-day South Dakota.This is another one of those movies (like 'In the Heart of the Sea') which, rather than just telling a fictional story with fictional characters, takes an incredible true story and uses the names of real people, but also inserts main characters which weren't part of the actual story, changes the motivations and fates of the real people and tells a story of half-truths. Well beyond taking dramatic license, films like this often leave many people with a perpetual misperception of historical events that will never be corrected. (I'm saying all this now, because doing so during my plot summary would result in spoilers.) Leonardo DiCaprio plays Glass, an experienced hunter and guide who once lived with the Pawnee Indians, married a Pawnee woman and, in the movie, has a teenage Pawnee son (Forrest Goodluck) with him on this particular expedition. When the men come under a sudden and brutal attack by a group of Arikara Indians (Rees, for short), they run for their boats, carrying as many bundles of their beaver pelts as they can get away with. Having lost over 30 men in the attack, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), the leader of the quasi-military hunting party, rallies his remaining men and orders them to start heading back to their trading post at Fort Kiowa.With the journey barely underway, Glass is attacked by a large brown bear protecting her cubs. He is mauled so badly that the men in his party hold out no hope for his survival. It becomes impossible for them to carry him over the increasingly rough terrain, so Henry leaves Glass in the care of his son, Hawk, the young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter), and experienced trapper John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). 'When' Glass dies, they are to bury him properly and then catch up with the group. Fitzgerald, unfortunately, is a man who only cares about protecting his own hide and selling as many beaver hides as he can. He soon takes actions which prevent the two young men from staying and looking after Glass.The rest of the movie remains focused primarily on DiCaprio's character, but tells three stories simultaneously. Glass basically wills himself to survive and improve enough to try to get himself to Fort Kiowa. Still badly injured, he literally drags himself toward his destination, doing his best to survive in spite of his wounds, the rough terrain, the worsening weather conditions and lack of food. He also has to make sure that he steers clear of the Rees. They continue to be a presence throughout the film, as their chief (Anthony Starlight) leads his men in search of his missing daughter (Melaw Nakehk'o), whom he believes was taken by white men in the area. Meanwhile, the men who left Glass behind are making their way back to their trading post, unaware that Glass is still alive – and is coming for his revenge.'The Revenant' is a great achievement in some ways, but not a great film. The main reason to see this movie is the acting, especially DiCaprio's performance. Leo completely immerses himself in his character's suffering and deserves an Oscar for everything he went through to deliver such a powerful performance. The problem with the movie is that it's almost all about the central character's physical and emotional pain, making for one depressing movie. The scenes of the bear attack and one harrowing escape from the Rees are both remarkable, but dragging out this character's suffering for as long as co-writer and director Alejandro González Iñárritu does, makes for an unnecessarily long movie. However, the movie's eventful final thirty minutes did help justify the time I had invested. Seeing this film is an endurance test – physically, emotionally and intellectually (for those of us who know how the story really unfolded) – but seeing Leo portray his character's endurance so effectively is just this side of being worth it.

Bridge of Spies," In 'Bridge of Spies', Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks bring us a 1st Class historical drama.
","A friend of mine recently posted on Facebook that his daughter had asked him who played the character called Hawkeye. 'Alan Alda,' was my friend's reply, thinking of the surgeon on TV's 'M*A*S*H'. But my friend's daughter was asking about the Marvel Comics character in the 'Avengers' films (played by Jeremy Renner). Besides amusing me, that little story got me thinking about how I was going to write my review of Steven Spielberg's historical drama 'Bridge of Spies' (PG-13, 2:21). If I'm going to discuss a movie in which 'The U-2 Incident' plays such a big part, it might be a good idea to point out that this reference has nothing to do with ticket scalping at a rock concert or anything of the sort. In fact, to better appreciate this review and, more importantly, Spielberg's film, you might want to do what I just did – reinforce and add to your historical knowledge of the aforementioned Cold War crisis, the Hollow Nickel Case and Rudolf Abel, Francis Gary Powers and James Donovan. Or you could just read my review and then go to the film, not just for a great cinematic history lesson but to see one terrific movie.Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer in the 1950s. Donovan is smart, honest, hard-working and, most importantly, he has principles and integrity – especially when it comes to the law. He has also served his country in uniform and assisted in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials. Donovan's law firm's senior partner (played, coincidentally, by the same Alan Alda mentioned in my previous paragraph) asks him to accept the thankless task of defending accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (multiple Tony Award winner Mark Rylance).Donovan is understandably less than enthusiastic about all of this, but his sincere belief that 'everyone deserves a defense' leads him to take the case. In spite of (and because of) his patriotism, he represents this obviously guilty spy as zealously and ethically as he represents all his clients. In the vehement and almost universal anti-communism of 1950s America, Donovan runs down every ground ball, making him one of the most hated men in America – and even endangering his family. His wife (Amy Ryan) supports him throughout the case, but she has some trouble understanding the lengths that he goes to for Abel.Fast-forward a few years. Abel is still in prison, and Donovan brings him a letter supposedly from his wife in the U.S.S.R. The letter amounts to a back-channel proposal from the Soviets to discuss trading Abel for recently captured U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). C.I.A. director Allen Dulles personally asks Donovan to negotiate the swap – but as a private citizen, NOT as a representative of the U.S. government. Telling his wife he's going on a business trip to London, Donovan heads to East Berlin, just as the politically divided city is being physically divided by the construction of the Berlin Wall.With a C.I.A. employee (Scott Shepherd) briefing and supporting him, but needing to otherwise keep his distance, Donovan begins his dangerous mission. Navigating check points and a street gang, he walks alone from West to East Berlin for an appointment inside the Soviet embassy. He meets unofficially with another man to, as Donovan says, 'have the conversation that our governments can't'. Further complicating an already tenuous negotiation is Donovan's personal decision to insist that the prisoner swap include an innocent American university student recently detained by East German authorities. Clearly, it's going to take every ounce of Donovan's intelligence, skill and nerve to accomplish his objectives, not the least of which is avoiding getting shot or even detained and put on trial himself.'Bridge of Spies' is that rare movie that can make history come to life and give it the immediacy of a first-class cinematic drama/thriller. Of course, there are those (as two people behind me in the theater seemed to do) who will walk out of a movie if it isn't very quickly filled with explosions, murders or at least a good chase scene, but short-sighted individuals like that miss an opportunity to enjoy the artistry of well-crafted stories that, sadly, are not as common as they used to be. This entire cast is exceptional, especially Hanks, who is as at the top of his game in full-on thinking man's 'boy scout' mode, and Mark Rylance who deserves significant awards season recognition and, of course, the always impressive Ryan.I should mention that the Cold War intrigue highlighted in the film's trailers is all in the second half of the film, but the script, co-written by Matt Charman and none other than Ethan and Joel Coen, is smart and compelling throughout. That story, coupled with Spielberg's expert touch, impressively recalls a time and tone that few Americans still remember, while giving us the twin dramas of a Soviet spy in the U.S. and a downed U.S. pilot in the Soviet Union. These two tales are seamlessly woven together and perfectly edited. The film also reminds us that what makes all of us Americans are not the political or religious beliefs we hold, but the principles we all stand for. 'Bridge of Spies' is as American as apple pie and about as rewarding an experience as anyone, regardless of nationality, could hope a film to be. 'A'",9,4,11,16 October 2015
Split," 'Split' is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years.
","Dissociative Identity Disorder (known as DID, and previously called Multiple Personality Disorder) is a psychological disorder in which a single person displays multiple distinct personalities, often as a defense mechanism to help the original personality deal with some sort of emotional trauma, like that suffered as a result of child abuse. These personalities each have a distinct name and distinct personality traits. As you can imagine, this condition is shrouded in mystery, is especially difficult to diagnose and treat and can be very dangerous for the sufferer – and for those around him/her/them. Fascination with DID has been fodder for a number of movies over the years, most notably in 1976 when Sally Field played (and won an Emmy for) a made-for-TV version of the true story of a woman who had 16 different personalities. ('Sybil' was remade, again for TV, in 2007, then starring Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange.) 2017 offers a fictional DID story in the form of the horror-thriller 'Split' (PG-13, 1:57), written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also co-produces for the second time with Jason Blum and Marc Bienstock of Blumhouse Productions, which gave us horror franchises like 'Paranormal Activity'.James McAvoy is Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man with 23 different personalities inside his head, but who is still able to function in society. He lives on his own, has held a good job for ten years, and regularly sees his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). She finds it difficult to treat Kevin, but she cares a great deal about his mental health and she makes herself available to him 24/7. She also finds it difficult to gain professional acceptance for the things she is learning about DID by working with Kevin. And it can be especially difficult for Dr. Fletcher to know which of Kevin's personalities with whom she is speaking. For a while now, she's been dealing primarily with Kevin's artistic personality, known as Barry, but something has changed in her recent sessions with Kevin. She senses it, but isn't sure what it means.However, three young women are experiencing firsthand what has changed in Kevin. High school friends Claire and Marcia (Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) are giving a ride to strange loner Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) when Kevin suddenly gets into their car, incapacitates the three of them and takes them to some sort of underground facility in which he lives and has built a room to hold the girls. Actually, it was Dennis, Kevin's most forceful personality, who abducted the three, but they don't understand what is going on, why they've been taken or what they should do about it. Disagreements over how to work together to escape and the emergence of Dennis' fellow 'alters' keep them off balance, but when they do take action, their attempts to resist just make matters worse for them. With the obvious exception of their captive state, the girls are unharmed, but it becomes clear that something bad is about to happen.'Split' is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years. Looking at audience and critics' ratings reveals that there was a slow, but steady decline in the popularity of his films after he burst into the public consciousness with his Best Picture Oscar-nominated 1999 drama-mystery-thriller 'The Sixth Sense'. That decline bottomed out with 2010's 'The Last Airbender', but rebounded slightly with 2013's 'After Earth'. The reception for his films improved further with his 2015 horror-thriller 'The Visit', his first film with Blumhouse Productions, who gave Shyamalan more artistic freedom than he had enjoyed in many years. Although 'Split' doesn't feature one of his trademark mind-bending twists, it's his best film in 10-15 years.Here, he has made a movie with an original concept, a compelling narrative and genuine tension which gradually builds. It helps that this is an especially well-acted horror film. McAvoy transforms himself (physically, emotionally and regarding audience perceptions of him), Buckley turns in her most powerful performance since the original 'Carrie' in 1976 and Taylor-Joy follows up her under-appreciated work in 2016's 'The Witch' and 'Morgan' showing that she's one of the most talented young actresses of the mid-late 2010s. And, almost as much as this film showing that Shyamalan is very much back as a director, his fans will appreciate seeing two actors from his earlier films in the cast and one killer reference to one of those films in the closing credits. 'Split' is not to be missed. 'A'",9,26,52,20 January 2017
Dunkirk," 'Dunkirk' is an innovative, well-crafted, engrossing and enjoyable film.
","The World War II battle and evacuation portrayed in director Christopher Nolan's 'Dunkirk' (PG-13, 1:46) involved no American troops, but had a big impact on the U.S. role – a full year and a half before it (officially) joined the fight. As the Nazi blitzkrieg swept through France, Belgium and the Netherlands in May of 1940, the armies of those countries, and their ally Great Britain, were pushed westward until they were trapped in the area around Dunkirk, France (near the Belgian border), with nowhere to go but into the English Channel. Nearly 400,000 of them. Nolan's trademark creativity led him to write and direct this film as a triptych, telling three related stories which took different periods of time to unfold, but showing them running concurrently throughout the film. A slate on the screen introduces each narrative (and the amount of time that it represents) from the first shot of each: '1. The Mole | One Week' (a mole being a pier-like, but solid breakwater built out from the beach); '2. The Sea | One Day'; '3. The Air | One Hour'. Once each of those printed designations fades from the screen, the movie moves back and forth between stories. On the beach, close to 400,000 men awaited their fate, whether it be rescue or annihilation. The German Army (which is barely shown and referred to only as 'the enemy') has the British, French, Belgian and Dutch troops surrounded on three sides, with the channel blocking their escape on the fourth. The Germans seem content, at least for the moment, to keep the troops bottled up on the beach and pick them off from the air with strafing missions and bomb the ships and boats attempting rescue. Among those struggling to survive on the beach are Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a British soldier who barely escapes unseen German rifles to make it to the mole, Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), a mysterious soldier with whom Tommy teams up and Alex (Harry Styles), another soldier whom they end up saving from a sinking ship and with whom they explore various opportunities to save themselves. When one of their plans goes awry, they end up overhearing a conversation in which a British naval commander (a composite character played by Kenneth Branagh) discusses with other officers how dire the situation is. On the sea, the British ships aren't up to the task of a rescue operation under these conditions. The Admiralty is unwilling to send over more than one large ship at a time for fear of losing ships that may be desperately needed for a last-ditch defense of the British Isles against an expected German invasion. Many of the smaller ships and boats that do arrive to assist with the rescue find themselves unable to navigate the shallow waters at Dunkirk, and only a few of them can even get close enough to load men who have walked out onto the mole. The attempted solution is for British naval officers on the English side of the channel to commandeer just about anything that floats to make the crossing to either bring soldiers back or ferry them from the shore out to the larger ships. Some boat owners take up the challenge personally out of a sense of duty and compassion. One of those is a mariner named Dawson (Oscar winner Mark Rylance), who brings along his teenage son (Tom Glynn-Carney) and his son's friend, George (Barry Keoghan). Their first encounter with someone who needs rescuing is a downed pilot (Cillian Murphy) who is on the verge of an emotional breakdown and becomes a danger to the mission.In the air, a squadron of three RAF pilots (including Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) patrol the skies for Luftwaffe planes and, when they find them, try to shoot them down to keep them from shooting the soldiers on the beach or bombing the ships and boats trying to rescue them. They doggedly and heroically pursue their mission, in spite of the unpredictability and danger of the Luftwaffe planes, very limited (dwindling) fuel supplies and the loss of comrades. As this and the other two narratives develop, the movie interweaves all three stories and brings each to logical, but fairly unpredictable conclusions.'Dunkirk' is an innovative, well-crafted and enjoyable film. Nolan (best known for his 'Dark Knight' trilogy, 'Inception' and 'Interstellar') effectively joins his three differently-paced narratives (although the back-and-forth between day and night in the beach scenes can be a little disorienting). His script contains a relatively small amount of dialog, instead building suspense by concentrating on the details of what's happening and showing all of it through the eyes of his actors. He chose to cast (mostly) unknown actors in order to focus on the characters' personal stories and he conducted an exhaustive casting process to make sure his approach would bear fruit. (And it did, even with the casting of One Direction singer Harry Styles in his first film role.) Nolan also shot using creative and evocative camera angles, he favored practical effects (rather than an overuse of green-screen technology) for his crowd scenes and action sequences and put a lot of effort into shooting with authentic period planes, ships and boats, some of which participated in the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. Oh, and Hans Zimmer's original score (complete with a synthesized version of Nolan's own pocket watch ticking away the time) stands out. In short, Christopher Nolan has dramatized a vital, but under-appreciated chapter of World War II history in a style that is all his own and has made a film that should appeal to Movie Fans of all styles. The little that it lacks in excitement, back story and narrative cohesion as compared to more traditional war films, it mostly makes up for in artistic and entertainment value.

Dallas Buyers Club," 'Dallas Buyers Club' features award-winning acting, but has little more going for it.
","A straight man (a homophobic straight man, nonetheless) with HIV when AIDS was thought of as a 'gay man's disease'. A person with HIV in the 1980s, when there were virtually no effective treatments available in the United States. That's the nearly impossible position in which Ron Woodroof found himself, and it's his real-life story that's told in 'Dallas Buyers Club' (R, 1:57).Woodroof (a gaunt Matthew McConaughey) is a Dallas electrician by day, cowboy when the rodeo is in town and a partier – whenever. His high-risk behaviors land him in the hospital where he is told he has HIV, and 30 days to live. Woodroof does his homework, but is unsuccessful at securing a steady supply of helpful medicines, until he travels to Mexico and brings back enough for him and a few dozen of his closest friends, provided those friends can pay. Woodroof becomes unlikely partners with Rayon (Jared Leto), a cross-dressing gay man, who helps bring him customers and the Dallas Buyers Club is born.Woodruff copies a business model, of sorts, that he learns is being used in other cities, and begins selling 'memberships'. Members are entitled to a variety of drugs and medicines (some natural and some experimental) that are not available in the U.S., but procured from a growing list of locations all around the world. Woodruff gets help from a local doctor (Jennifer Garner) who gradually comes to understand that he really is helping people. Woodroof, however, is battling the local authorities, the medical establishment, the drug companies, and even his former friends, all of which perceive him as a threat, for various reasons. Meanwhile, he develops full-blown AIDS. Although he lives much longer than originally projected, he knows his days are numbered and he wants his life to mean something.The strength of 'Dallas Buyers Club' is its acting – mostly that from the two main characters. McConaughey and Leto both give earnest and heart-breaking, but somehow uplifting and definitely award-worthy performances. (Editor's note: Both men eventually received Screen Actors Guild Awards, Golden Globe Awards and Oscars for their work in this film.) Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for this film begins and ends with the acting. The story is interesting enough (not to mention important, yet little-known), but the movie drags, and it feels much longer than its 117 minutes. Its entertainment value, although bolstered by its talented leads, is still relatively low. 'B-'.",5,1,2,23 December 2015
Captain America: Civil War," 'Captain America: Civil War' is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
","Marvel sure has things figured out (which is a statement likely made in recent years by many a Movie Fan – and the folks at DC – with a few expletives thrown in for emphasis)! If there were any lingering doubt, it has certainly been erased by 'Captain America: Civil War' (PG-13, 2:26). While the DC Extended Universe has had moderate success with their early films featuring and bringing together their stable of comic book characters, the Marvel Cinematic Universe began Phase Three of its grand plan with 'Civil War' (the 13th MCU movie) and is making money almost faster than the government can print it. While the first two 'Avengers' movies sit comfortably in the top 10 on the list of all-time box office champs worldwide, DC's 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' doesn't even make the top 40. 'Civil War' made over $250 million worldwide before its first full day in U.S. theaters – and even before opening in huge countries like China and India! The film's opening week receipts in several countries is second all-time only to 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', and its trailer is second only to 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' in online views. But does this Captain America film deserve such attention and success? 'Captain America: Civil War' is the third (and planned to be the final) Captain America feature, but also feels a lot like a third Avenger's movie, with its many characters – and its plot, which continues story lines from the most recent installment of each of those film series. This film picks up about a year after the Avengers defeated a populicidal sentient computer program which Tony Stark accidentally unleashed in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are in Lagos, Nigeria trying to stop Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) from stealing and making off with a dangerous biological weapon. In the ensuing melee, one of the Avengers, trying to save the life of one of the others, accidentally causes the deaths of several foreign aid workers.After all the death and destruction inadvertently caused the last time that the Avengers were out saving the world (from Ultron), Lagos proves to be the proverbial last straw for worried world leaders, and their planned remedy bitterly divides the Avengers. The U.S. Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), presents the group with an ultimatum – sign the newly-negotiated 'Sokovia Accords', putting the Avengers under the control of the United Nations – or retire. As they discuss their options, this disparate group of superheroes quickly divides into opposing camps. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) speaks for Lieutenant Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and others who believe they should submit themselves to this international oversight. Cap speaks for Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and those who believe that they can only effectively protect people when they can operate unfettered. So, the battle lines are drawn.Almost 200 nations (and some of the Avengers) sign the agreement, but it's quickly put to the test when a bombing compels some of the Avengers to act. The accused terrorist is none other than Cap's old (very old) friend, Bucky Barnes, aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Cap wants to bring Bucky in safely before any of Bucky's trigger-happy pursuers catch up to him. Cap gets just enough help to accomplish his goal, but it turns out that Bucky is merely a pawn in a much larger game run by Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl). As the plot unfolds, the Avengers duke it out with both old friends and new ones joining the fray.'Captain America: Civil War' is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie has plenty of high-stakes, globe-trotting, hero-on-hero action, and it also has a lot of heart. If you think back to the first individual MCU films with Iron Man and Captain America, it may seem counterintuitive for Stark to support restrictions on the Avengers while Cap refuses to 'be a good soldier' and get with the program, but we see that each of them have very clear and very personal motivations for taking the positions that they take. The same is true for the other frenemy combatants, some of which elicited cheers from the audience when they first appeared on screen. Of course, if you paid attention to the film's ubiquitous trailers and/or took a good look at its posters, you know which Avengers are present, which are missing and which are new, but just in case you don't know I won't spoil it. All I'll say is that Marvel has cast and established all of these characters exceptionally well.The action, acting and directing are all top notch, but this film's main strength is its smart script. The characters' personalities, powers and previous activities are remarkably consistent in their presentation and are seamlessly blended in a big, but simple story which makes sense and gives each character his or her due. The dialog is a great combination of insightful, fun and funny. The movie seems to borrow from the 'Bourne' movies, certain revenge flicks, and 'Escape Plan', while the story is similar to DC's 2016 hero-against-hero film 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice', but 'Captain America: Civil War' does it better and has a dynamic and tone all its own. It'll entertain fanboys and average Movie Fans alike. 'A'",9,10,20,6 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' can be enjoyed by wizards and muggles alike.
","Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person in the English-speaking world (or beyond) who has never read a Harry Potter book or seen a Harry Potter movie. I have nothing personal against the little wizard. It's just that his story never interested me until now. I'm not much of a reader (considering movies to be a more efficient use of the time that I have available for entertainment) and the film franchise ended before I started regularly writing movie reviews. But, in 2016, as a published reviewer, I felt that it was my responsibility to see 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' (PG-13, 2:13) – and to do so with an open mind, as I try to do with all the movies that I see and review. On all counts, I'm glad I did my duty.What does this movie have to do with Harry Potter's story, you ask. Well, I'm just an ordinary muggle, but I have done my research, so please allow me to take a crack at answering your question: 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is one of the titles on the mandatory reading list for first year students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when 11-year-old Harry Potter first began attending. The then classic textbook was ostensibly written by someone named Newt Scamander. In our non-magical world, such a tome appeared on book shelves in 2001. The book announced the same Newt Scamander as its author, but was, of course, written by Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling (with the profits going to the charity Comic Relief). In 2013, Rowling struck a deal to adapt her book into a screenplay (her first foray into screen writing) and co-produce this, the first film in a planned 5-part series. And here we are.In 1926 (which Harry Potter fans may know, is the year before the aforementioned textbook was published), Newt Scamander (Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne) is finishing his globe-trotting research for what will become his Hogwarts-approved text. Before he heads home to the British Isles, however, he stops in New York on his way to Arizona, where he plans to release a Thunderbird named Frank in his natural habitat. Newt is carrying a suitcase which would probably qualify as a modern-day carry-on, but through magical means, contains a number of strange creatures – in a whole fantastical magical world. Unfortunately (for Newt, that is, but fortunate for us Movie Fans), Newt's stopover in New York quickly turns chaotic. He is being spied on by Porpentina 'Tina' Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a former Auror (security official) who is working for (but fallen somewhat out of favor with) the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA). Newt is being confronted by an anti-magic street preacher named Mary Lou Barebone (Oscar nominee Samantha Morton) when one of Newt's creatures (a cute platypus-looking, coin and jewelry-loving 'niffler') escapes from Newt's case and runs into a bank.As he uses his wizardry to retrieve his niffler, Newt becomes entangled with a hapless wannabe baker named Jacob Kowalski (comedian and voice actor Dan Fogler). Before Newt can obliviate Jacob (erase from his memory the magic he has witnessed), Jacob runs off after accidentally switching his case of pastries with Newt's case, with its plethora of magical creatures. (Can I get an 'uh-oh'!) Tina tries to use the situation to get back into the good graces of MACUSA and its no-nonsense President Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo), but they both are quickly distracted by the magical havoc being wreaked in New York City. Naturally, when Jacob opens 'his' case, Newt's creatures escape, which forces Newt both to save and partner with Jacob and also soon involving Tina and her younger sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol), who can read minds and who becomes quite smitten with Jacob. Meanwhile, Henry Shaw (Oscar winner Jon Voight), the father of an ambitious young U.S. Senator, and the mysterious and morally questionable Mary Lou and her troubled adopted son, Credence (Ezra Miller) get caught up in this whole mess in some very dramatic ways, as does MACUSA Auror Percival Graves (Oscar nominee Colin Farrell), who was already investigating a destructive magical entity in NYC and has questionable motives himself.'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is a delightful and creative journey into a world which a boy wizard and a muggle (or a 'no-maj', which is the American equivalent) would likely find equally fascinating. The story may be tough to follow for those who are new to the Harry Potter universe, but reading non-spoiler summaries like the one above should help. Either way, it's a lot of fun to take it all in and learn as you go. The story has a lot going on, but Rowling and director David Yates (he of the last four Harry Potter films) weave the various plot threads together wonderfully and include some nice 'Easter Eggs' for the many Harry Potter fans who will be watching. The casting is excellent (and in one late reveal, thrillingly startling), but Redmayne's portrayal of Newt as a bumbler is a bit distracting and Waterson's Tina is a little inconsistent. The visual effects are very good (and worth seeing in 3D), but feel somewhat overused. All in all, however, this movie is an entertaining excursion and a great introduction to those of us who were heretofore unfamiliar with the imaginative worlds created by J.K. Rowling.

Jackie," 'Jackie' rises on Portman's performance, but stumbles over some of the filmmakers' decisions.
","Jacqueline Bouvier. Jackie Kennedy. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Jackie O. Jackie. There are many ways to refer to this singularly iconic woman – and many ways to remember her. That breathy voice. That educated and sophisticated demeanor. Her sense of style including that pink suit, later tragically stained with the blood of a slain president, husband and father. And, of course, her extraordinary poise and grace in the wake of President Kennedy's assassination. Her public image and the sights and sounds that surrounded her are indelible for so many Americans – and people all around the world – but how much do we really know about her as a person? How much do we really understand? Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was a very public person, with a very private sensibility, best known for being at the center of one of the most traumatic moments in American history. 'Jackie' (R, 1:40), directed by Pablo Larrain, written by Noah Oppenheim and starring Oscar-winner Natalie Portman as the title character do their best to help us peak behind the curtain and learn more about the woman behind that famous face.'Life' Magazine writer Theodore H. White (Billy Crudup) arrives at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts for his appointment to interview Jackie Kennedy, one of the most famous women in the world. Just one week after her husband's assassination, Mrs. Kennedy, who invited the Pulitzer Prize winner to do this interview, is already very concerned that her husband may be forgotten – or misunderstood by history. White, who is deferential, but firm and professional, finds a woman who is clearly still grieving her horrible loss, but who is also very much in control of herself – and very much in control regarding her husband's legacy – even to the point of editing White's notes during the interview.While returning periodically to the scenes of the interview, most of Jackie's story is told in flashback scenes of her as First Lady – especially on that fateful day in November of 1963 – and the four days that followed. We get a sense of who she was as First Lady from a look at the filming (no, not taping – not in 1962) of Jackie Kennedy's famous televised tour of the White House, during which she showed and discussed her historic and artistic changes to 'The People's House', as she calls it, while she receives help and support from her close aide, Nancy Tuckerman (Greta Gerwig). But most of 'Jackie' revolves around the assassination, its immediate aftermath and the funeral preparations.In spite of being traumatized by the shooting, Jackie 'keeps it together' as well as anyone in those circumstances could, cradling her husband's fatally-wounded head in her lap on the way to the hospital and desperately hoping that he might survive, dutifully standing with the new First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson (Beth Grant), beside Vice President Lyndon Johnson (John Carroll Lynch), as he takes the oath of office and becomes President of the United States, and then, after sitting motionless beside her husband's casket during the flight back to Washington, D.C., refusing to change her blood-stained suit before exiting the plane and being photographed by the press, 'so they can see what they did to Jack'.While caring for her children and making plans for their future, Jackie becomes intimately involved with the planning of her husband's funeral. President Johnson and his new administration, including Special Assistant Jack Valenti (Max Casella), respectfully defer to Jackie's wishes regarding every detail, even when she changes her mind. She uses the funeral of Abraham Lincoln as a template for her plans, including insisting on an open procession through the streets of Washington, in spite of the well-founded security concerns that are raised. Alternately sharing their grief and having stress-fueled clashes, Jackie and her brother-in-law, Robert F. Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) work together on these plans, including choosing JFK's grave site in Arlington National Cemetery. As much as we learn about Jackie from watching her during those four days in November, we gain even more insight into her private thoughts during scenes of a conversation with an elderly priest (John Hurt) at the cemetery.'Jackie' is fascinating and compelling, but includes elements which damage its overall quality. The script and direction shed a lot of light on what happened (and might have happened) during the private moments of this very public national nightmare, while painting a very personal portrait of Jackie Kennedy, but the editing harms the film's potential effectiveness. The chronology of events, while not very difficult to follow, simply jumps around too much, and the choices of which bits of archival footage to use and where to use them, distracts from and even contradicts the film's own cinematography. Meanwhile, the score is overwhelming and unnecessarily melodramatic.The primary strength of this film is Portman, who nails Jackie Kennedy's voice and mannerisms, while infusing her with a complex combination of vulnerability, tenacity and grace under pressure. Some of the other casting is shaky. Two of the major players in this historical drama, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and President Lyndon Johnson, are played by actors who look virtually nothing like the real-life men, and make little attempt to act or even sound like them. Fortunately, strong supporting turns by Casella, Hurt, Gerwig and Richard E. Grant (as chairman of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts) pick up the slack. Overall, 'Jackie' is a valuable and satisfying addition to the long list of cinematic portrayals of the Kennedy family and their tragic, but resilient history. Movie Fans will likely end this film feeling they know and understand more about the Kennedy assassination, its impact on the country and, most importantly, the woman most affected by it all: Jackie.

Legend," 'Legend' is strong (especially in its performances), but isn't quite legend-ary.
","If the bond between twins is special, the bond between identical twins is almost spiritual. Identical twins share their DNA, their looks and often (but not always) their personalities. No twins are ever completely identical, but what joins them is almost always stronger than what separates them – for better or worse. In the case of Reggie and Ronnie Cray, the real-life 1950s and 60s-era London gangsters portrayed in the biopic 'Legend' (R, 2:11), their unbreakable bond and their similarities were definitely for the worse.In real life and in this film (the second one about the brothers, following 1990's 'The Krays'), Reggie and Ronnie were tough kids who became tough and ruthless adults. As kids, they once had a fight during which Reggie almost killed Ronnie. As teens, they made very effective use of their aggression and their physical abilities in the boxing ring. As adults, their 'might makes right' mentality made them the most powerful and feared gangsters in London. They were two halves of the same fertilized egg who became two halves of the same coin, but there were still differences. Reggie was more of a lover governed by his mind and Ronnie was more of a fighter ruled by his impulses. Reggie was more refined, and Ronnie was simply psychotic. Romantically and sexually, Reggie liked women, while Ronnie liked men. One could note other differences between these men, but those differences are almost inconsequential when viewed in light of their unbreakable bond as twins and unshakable commitment to being crime legends.British actor Tom Hardy plays both Kray twins, with all of their differences and similarities, and through the separate, yet intertwined events in their lives as gangsters. Both men did time in prison for their business methods, but were never incarcerated at the same time (at least during the period of their lives covered in this film). When Ronnie was in prison, Reggie proudly ran a classy dinner and entertainment club. When Reggie was in prison, Ronnie practically ran that club into the ground with his odd behavior and counter-productive business practices. With both the twins on the streets at the same time, they added clubs and gained power in London's criminal underworld through a combination of extortion and violence. They also partner up with gangsters in the U.S. (represented by a character played by Chazz Palminteri) and pursue very different love lives, with Reggie becoming engaged to his beloved Frances (Emily Browning), while Ronnie spends time with young men like 'Mad Teddy' Smith (Taron Egerton).The underworld empire of the Krays, like all other criminal organizations, inevitably peaks, then declines. For a while, they seem untouchable, due to a combination of their brutal business tactics and just plain luck. (For example, when a member of the British House of Lords becomes involved in the homosexual activities of Ronnie and his friends, and a scandal looms, the authorities increasingly ignore the brothers' criminal activities in order to keep the public's attention diverted from the lord's indiscretions.) The Kray brothers' business manager (David Thewlis) struggles to keep their criminal empire solvent in spite of Ronnie's erratic and violent behavior. Meanwhile, Reggie struggles with Frances' persistent demands that he pursue his business activities without resorting to illegal methods. Through these and other challenges, the continued success of the Kray twins' endeavors are threatened by problems from their pasts, increasingly erratic behavior during their present and that ever-present unconditional loyalty which starts to seem unlikely to sustain them much farther into their future.The mixture of strengths and weaknesses in the movie 'Legend' mirrors that same condition that we see in Reggie and Ronnie Kray. Telling the story primarily through Reggie's eyes keeps the story focused, but the directing is uneven and the use of narration by Frances is unnecessary and gimmicky. The story unfolds like a British version of 'Goodfellas' (especially if you imagine Ray Liotta's and Joe Pesci's characters as brothers) and seems to be paying homage to Martin Scorsese's gangster classic, but the amount of similarities between the films becomes distracting. Writer-director Brian Helgeland, whose efforts gave us 'L.A. Confidential', 'Mystic River' and '42', delivers a strong movie here, but fails to tap into the magic that produced some of his earlier work. This film is engaging and entertaining, but it owes most of that to its experienced and talented cast, especially, Browning who is both adorable and strong as the film's emotional center, and Hardy who caps off a great year of on-screen work (including 'Child 44' and 'Mad Max: Fury Road') with an Oscar-worthy performance (actually two performances) which is/are earthy, funny, heartbreaking and frightening. Would that the rest of the film were as impressive. While it doesn't suffer from flaws as fatal as those in the Kray twins, 'Legend' isn't quite legendary. 'B'",6,2,4,6 December 2015
Get Out," 'Get Out' is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film.
","Writers are told 'write what you know'. For Jordan Peele, that meant writing (and directing) 2017's 'Get Out' (R, 1:43), but also stretching significantly as an artist. Half of the Comedy Central comic duo of Key and Peele, Peele has been a comedian since college and is a veteran of The Second City improv troupe and MADtv. The product of an interracial marriage, much of Peele's comedy springs from his observations about race and racial divisions in the U.S., while he also uses his work as a form of social commentary on those issues. His talent and insight have earned him nominations for the Emmy Award and NAACP Image Award (multiple times each – including one Emmy win, an American Comedy Award and a Peabody Award for accomplishments in public media). Peele has also appeared in films (including 2016's 'Keanu', with comedy partner Keegan-Michael Peele), television shows and internet videos. All of those experiences serve him well in 'Get Out', a movie which has moments of comedy and carries implications for our racially divided modern world, but is actually more horror film than anything else.Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a New York City photographer who is preparing to drive out to the country with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), in order to meet her parents for the first time. Chris is nervous about how Rose's parents will react to their daughter dating a black man and Chris' buddy, TSA agent Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), teases him over the phone about the situation. Rose reassures Chris that her parents are very liberal and open-minded. As Rose predicted, her father, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and her mother, Missy (Catherine Keener), welcome Chris with open arms.It turns out that they are not racist, but they do make a number of racially insensitive remarks without realizing it and they employ two servants, both of whom are black. Walter (Marcus Henderson), the groundskeeper, and Georgina (Betty Gabriel), the maid, both act so politely that it seems phony to Chris, not to mention that they both speak very strangely. When Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), shows up for dinner, he is even rougher around the edges than his parents. Things get even more uncomfortable for Chris when an annual gathering at the Armitage home introduces Chris to a host of rich white people much like Rose's parents (except for a blind art dealer played by Stephen Root), while one older woman is married to a young black man (LaKeith Stanfield) who looks vaguely familiar to Chris, but who doesn't act anything like the black men that Chris knows from back in his native Brooklyn.But it's not just the way everyone acts that makes Chris uncomfortable – it's also the things that are happening around him. A police officer whom they meet after hitting a deer on a country road treats Chris like he did something wrong, even though he wasn't driving at the time. Missy, who is a psychiatrist, voices her strong opposition to Chris smoking around her daughter and insists on hypnotizing Chris in order to help him break the habit, even after Chris turns down her offer. She also keeps prodding him to talk about a painful memory from his childhood. Chris talks to Rod on the phone about the strangeness of his weekend and then Chris starts finding his phone unplugged. It also turns out that Rose hasn't been entirely forthcoming about her dating history. I'd like to say more, but I won't because, as much as I've already written, there are still plenty of surprises for the audience to discover.'Get Out' is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film. Although admittedly influenced by 'The Stepford Wives', what happens in this movie and why it's happening is original and sheds fresh light on the subtler manifestations of racism in America, even from sympathetic and well-meaning people and groups. In fact, it's easy to see this movie as one mainly about racism, but generally, as a Movie Fan, I see it mainly as a well-crafted horror film. There's a certain creepiness about it that starts early, and then slowly, steadily ramps up throughout the film and its appropriately unexpected and shocking reveals. Some of the plot points strain scientific credulity, but that seems to matter little in what is basically a horror fantasy. The film is perfectly cast and terrifically acted. There's also some funny, effective and well-placed comic relief (from Howery's character). That's to be expected from someone like Jordan Peele, but who knew that he would be so good at horror? This movie feels like one of M. Night Shyamalan's better films, with a strong subtext of social commentary. For so effectively presenting these elements and perfectly balancing them, this film deserves the nearly perfect grade of 'A'.",9,8,19,4 March 2017
Room," Make space in your life (and in your heart) for 'Room'.
","Which of the following situations would you find the most traumatic? (1) You are kidnapped, removed from everyone and everything you know and love, never knowing if you will ever be free again. (2) You are born into a captivity in which you know hardly anything about what most people take for granted as 'the world' and then are suddenly thrust into that world with almost no understanding of what you're seeing, what to do or how to behave. Stop. Think about it. Either situation would be a horribly upsetting and disorienting to experience. We see both situations play out in the fictional drama 'Room' (R, 1:58). Although the film is not based on any specific real-life story, it does have a strong basis in reality – in the cases that we occasionally see on the news or in a true-crime TV drama. A young woman is taken captive by a monstrous person who holds her for years against her will. In some cases, innocent children are born into such situations, knowing nothing but confinement, with only a mother's love to depend on.Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) was seventeen when a man who claimed that he needed help with a sick dog abducted Joy and imprisoned her in the garden shed in his back yard. The man (Sean Bridgers), whose name Joy didn't know (simply referring to him as 'Old Nick') kept Joy as a sex slave, bringing her just enough food and other essentials to survive. He brought her supplies once a week, but visited her for sex every night. Eventually, Old Nick's ongoing rape of Joy produced a baby boy. Joy named him Jack. Jack only knows Joy as 'Ma'. He has never even seen Old Nick. At a set time every night, Joy sends Jack to sleep on the floor of the wardrobe in the corner of the room. Old Nick punches a code into the door's electronic lock. He enters. He does 'his business' and leaves. Jack is now free to climb into bed with Ma.The days belong to Joy and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). He's now five years old. He has never had a haircut, never seen a doctor and never left Room. The wardrobe where he sleeps when Old Nick comes calling, Ma's bed, a toilet, bathtub, sink, toaster oven, small table and old television is all Jack has ever known. As far as he knows, the world he sees on TV is all made up and the small skylight in the roof of the shed is outer space. To Jack, there simply is nothing else but Room, the mysterious voice of Old Nick, and Ma. For her part, Joy does all she can for Jack. She 'cooks' the meager rations that Old Nick brings and she breastfeeds Jack. She's his teacher, his playmate, his protector and, basically the only person who exists.As hard as Joy works to make a life for her and Jack in Room, their situation is starting to change, calling their long-term survival into question. Joy has tried to escape before, but it becomes clear to her that she has to try again. Maybe Jack is now old enough to help – if she can get him to understand her plan. It isn't a spoiler to reveal that Joy's escape plan works, because that is what the second half of this movie is about. Joy is reunited with her mother (Joan Allen) and father (William H. Macy), who are now divorced. Joy and Jack move in with her mother and her mother's boyfriend (Tom McCamus) who do their best to help Joy and Jack adjust to their newfound freedom, with all that means for each of them.These adjustments aren't be easy. Jack has to learn everything that you and I take for granted about our world. Joy has to try to get past the emotional trauma of seven years of captivity and having raised a son in that environment. Then, of course, there are certain legal questions that a family lawyer is now there to handle and the media circus that naturally accompanies such stories in real life. This film doesn't dwell on the legal or public aspects of this case, but those elements are there in the background, even while this dramatically changed family focuses on finding a way to forge fresh bonds and move forward in the most difficult of situations.'Room' is as remarkable as the story it portrays. Basing the film on the 2010 novel by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) frees the plot to explore a wide variety of issues without being confined to the details of one specific real-life case. Telling the story through Jack's eyes (complete with a judicious use of well-written narration by the boy) helps us to understand the wide ranging implications of such an experience for Jack, his mother and his newfound family. Director Lenny Abrahamson takes full advantage of these story-telling opportunities with his use of camera angles and the markedly different tone in the movie's very different halves. Topping it all off are exceptionally affecting performances by all the main characters – especially Larson and Tremblay. Although the pacing of the film sometimes lags unnecessarily, there is no criticizing this film's emotional impact and the importance of the lessons that it teaches its audience. I have no room to give this film anything less than an 'A'.",9,1,7,6 December 2015
A Quiet Place," wonderfully original and incredibly suspenseful
","'A Quiet Place' (PG-13, 1:30) is a horror thriller directed, co-written and co-starring John Krasinski. The screenplay's other two writers are Bryan Woods and Scott Beck who came up with this very original story. In this claustrophobic dystopian tale, uneasily set only two years ahead of the film's release date, very deadly, presumably extraterrestrial creatures roam the countryside. Think the aliens from 'Aliens', but a skinnier version - and with sharper claws. Oh, but these aliens are blind. They hunt by sound - with deadly effectiveness. Almost any noise naturally made by humans merely living and interacting with their environment brings these creatures running and often results in a quick and merciless demise.As the film opens (with no back story), Lee Abbott (Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Krasinski's real-life wife, Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt) are already living the horror described above, on a farm, along with their children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe), who are all well acquainted with the precautions they must take to survive. They walk barefoot everywhere. They communicate with each other in sign language. The play board games with cloth game pieces. No. Noise. Allowed.For Regan, this was already her world, actually being deaf. Lee works (silently, of course) in his basement trying to build a better hearing aide. He also sends Morse code messages over a radio, hoping to contact someone who can help his family. The only regular sign that anyone else in the area is alive are signal fires that appear at scattered points in the distance. It's a lonely, stressful existence, but the Abbotts are busying themselves with a family project. They are attempting to soundproof the cellar under their barn. You see, Evelyn is going to have a baby. (Yeah, let that one sink in for a minute.)'A Quiet Place' is the most original horror thriller since 'Get Out'. The 2018 film may not carry with it the social significance of that Oscar winner from 2017, but it sure builds suspense. Tension is high from the first scene and is quickly supplemented by a deep pathos as this family fights to survive both emotionally and physically. Every errant sound is designed to make us wince, every plot point to make us cringe and every seemingly inescapable danger to put us on the edge of our seats. Great writing, acting and directing does all that and more. 'A'",9,3,8,6 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is an entertaining return to the roots of the franchise.
","The trident, a three-pronged spear appearing in European and Asian mythology and still a recognizable symbol today, is the object of everyone's desire in 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' (PG-13, 2:09), the fifth film in Disney's 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise. Historically, tridents have been used for spear fishing and as weapons. In Greek, Roman and Hindu religious traditions, the trident is the weapon of the gods Poseidon, Neptune and Shiva, respectively. In the folklore of the ancient Greeks, Poseidon used his trident to create bodies of water and also to stir up storms at sea. In short, the trident is said to be able to control the waters, a handy implement to have at your disposal, especially if you're a pirate, a sailor, or have become somehow beholden to the powers of the sea.Captain Jack Sparrow is not dead. He's just sleeping. In a safe. It's part of a bank robbery scheme that he and his crew want to pull off – if Jack can stay sober long enough to make their plan work. But not much works out for Jack (Johnny Depp, in his fifth turn as the perpetually unlucky, inebriated, horny pirate). He soon finds himself on the wrong side of a new French invention called the guillotine. (And the way that turns out, let's hope it doesn't inspire the Disneyland parks to create a guillotine ride next to the ride which originally inspired this film franchise.) As Jack peers into a basket of severed heads, he's just yards away from a young woman named Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) who is standing atop a wooden platform with a noose around her neck. As Jack is about to lose his head, she's about to have the blood flow to hers cut off because she is believed to be a witch. What else would 18th century British colonists in the Caribbean call a woman of science who is so knowledgeable about astronomy and horology? Carina had recently met another new character to the franchise, Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites). Henry was under arrest on suspicion of treason because he was the only survivor of a British naval vessel which was destroyed in an area of the sea known as the Devil's Triangle. Henry was serving on the ship as a way of searching for the Trident of Poseidon, a mythical object that supposedly can be used to control the oceans – including their curses. Henry is the son of Will Turner, whom we last saw in the third 'Pirates' movie, and Henry wants the Trident so he can free his father from his cursed existence aboard the ghost ship known as the Flying Dutchman. Carina thinks she can find the Trident – and she wants to do so very badly – as a way to connect her to the seafaring father whom she never knew. In the chaos that ensues as Jack's crew, led by his friend and First Mate Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally), frees Jack from the guillotine, Henry saves Carina from the hangman's noose and a big new team is formed. Captain Jack, always up for an adventure, loads everyone onto the Dying Gull and they shove off.Not surprisingly, this mission won't exactly be smooth sailing. Jack is being pursued by an undead Spanish naval officer and former pirate hunter called Captain Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his (literally) rotten crew on a ghost ship of their own. Captain Salazar blames Jack for his fate and that of his crew (which we understand after seeing a very informative flashback sequence). He wants nothing more than to see Jack dead – and also to get a hold of the Trident so he can break free of his curse. While searching for Jack, Salazar cruises the Caribbean, destroying every ship and killing every crew in his deadly path. When he comes upon the ship commanded by Captain Jack's old First Mate and rival, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), convinces Captain Salazar to spare his life so he can help find Jack. Plus, Barbossa wouldn't mind getting his own hands on the Trident of Poseidon in the process.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is an entertaining return to the roots of this lucrative cinematic franchise. With a new crew on deck (the directing team of Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, screenwriter Jeff Nathanson and composer Geoff Zanelli), the intention was to get back to the relative simplicity, sense of adventure and heart of the original. There's still a lot going on in this movie, but the plot is relatively straightforward (even if it feels a bit contrived) and it's definitely less bloated than the previous installment(s). This one also nicely ties up its storyline (along with some others from earlier in the series), while a post-credits scene makes it clear that there are potentially more stories to tell. But as far as 2017 is concerned, the fifth film displays the great acting, the sense of humor and the action-packed spirit of fun for which the franchise is known – plus the heart of the earlier films.

X-Men: Apocalypse," 'X-Men Apocalypse' is technically masterful and fun to watch, but feels like too much of a good thing.
","Call 2016 'The Year of the Superhero Battles'. After the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel went at each other in 'Batman v. Superman' and the Avengers divided (then reunited) and conquered in 'Captain America: Civil War', 'X-Men Apocalypse' (PG-13, 2:24) features mutants fighting each other. They're fighting over a mutant's mutant named En Sabah Nur. But you can just call him Apocalypse. That name reveals this film's tie-in with another cinematic superhero trend of the 2010s – world domination. After the Avengers prevented a sentient A-I baddie named Ultron from destroying mankind and rebooting the world in 2015, an ancient mutant who is actually named for the end of the world tries to do the same in 2016. Or is it 1983? Heck, these movies' own characters have trouble keeping it all straight – even within the X-Men universe. In a meta reference in 2016's 'Deadpool', as Colossus drags the title character across a bridge and says, 'You will come talk to Professor Xavier', Deadpool understandably and hilariously responds, 'McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines can get so confusing.'I'll try to keep from confusing things further with my plot summary, by limiting character references for simplicity's sake. (To read more about who's in this movie, God has given us IMDb and Wikipedia.) In 'X-Men: Apocalypse', a variety of human beings with special powers continues their magical mystery tour of the planet, as the supremely psychic mentor and do-gooder Professor Xavier (that's James McAvoy in this one, Mr. Pool) tries to bring out the good in all mutants - even the bad ones. Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is trying to live a quiet country life in Poland when something happens that REALLY makes him mad and he's not inclined to be magnanimous towards his enemies. We then meet three other overseas mutants who are morally ambiguous and/or evil to varying degrees. We also see the sometimes-but-not-currently-blue-hued Raven Darkhölme / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) traveling the world and recruiting (for Xavier's academy) young mutants like the teleporting Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Meanwhile, back at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters in Westchester, New York, Professor X is working hard to help a growing number of resident mutants. They include the telekinetic Jean Grey / Phoenix (Sophie Turner) and Scott Summers / Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), whose eyes have just started shooting out extremely destructive laser beams. The Professor has help from the also sometimes-but-not-currently-blue-hued Hank McCoy / Beast (Nicholas Hoult), but X becomes distracted by the re-emergence of his memory-impaired old flame, CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), who is in Egypt investigating the legend of an ancient mutant, who's also part of this movie's 50 Shades of Blue.Back in ancient Egypt, about five and a half millennia ago (give or take a century), En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse (an unrecognizable Oscar Isaac) continued his habit of transferring his consciousness into the younger bodies of other mutants, and, in the process, adding their powers to his personal super power arsenal. When some mutant-haters betray him, and even his current generation of four helpers (later called 'The Four Horsemen') can't save him, he's buried underneath a collapsed pyramid and forced to take a very, very, very long sand nap. As one summary of this movie has said, 'Fast-forward to 1983 (10 years after the mind-bending, time-travelling events in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past').' Some present-day believers unearth the king of the mutants, utter some chants, and release En Sabah Nur into the modern world. He catches up on everything he has missed (and learns to speak English) by touching a TV set and immediately begins gathering another team of mutant minions. He has decided that mankind has gone astray without his guidance and he plans to wipe out nearly all humans (whether they're evil or not) – and he doesn't even provide any of them with an ark! This harsh latter-day Darwinist will only allow the strongest to survive, destroy everything man has made, and then rebuild. 'X-Men: Apocalypse' is impressive and entertaining, but seems like a little too much of a good thing. Its visual effects, action set pieces and hair-make-up work, taken as a whole, represent the most creative and best executed that I've ever seen in a single movie. At first blush, those sets of accomplishments seemed destined for some serious awards season love (with more than a few wins). However, the film's extraordinary technical achievements are symptomatic of what's wrong with it. Although Movie Fans who are new to the X-Men franchise will be unable to appreciate the layered character development and the references to the previous films, the plot of this film does stand alone and isn't hard to follow. It's fun and awe-inspiring to watch but has too much going on. This movie naturally brings to mind previous X-Men installments, along with movies in which several (or all) of the Avengers appear. If this trend continues, Stan Lee himself (who, of course, has a brief cameo in this Marvel film, with his real-life wife) may have to develop a super power and pick up a shield or something.Come to think of it, I wonder if I'm the only one who would be interested to see Ultron and Apocalypse go up against each other. Of course, they'd both have to still be 'alive' for that to happen, but the way the X-Men franchise plays fast and loose with timelines, anything is possible. Then there's the possibility that Ultron and Apocalypse, with their different but complementary skill sets and mutual penchant for destruction, could join forces. In that case, all the X-Men AND Avengers joining forces might still be unable to stop that dastardly duo. Even if such a battle were to be fought, the resulting movie (with cameras naturally there to capture every crash-bang-boom) would be even more cluttered than 'X-Men: Apocalypse' which I'm giving a 'B+'.",7,4,7,27 May 2016
Grudge Match," 'Grudge Match' is an entertaining film about art imitating life imitating art.
","Surprises are nice. Surprises are interesting. Surprises are fun. It's surprising when a pair of aging boxers show that they can still bring it. It's surprising when aging actors show us something fresh and new. It's surprising when people who have very good reasons to hate each other find common ground. And it's surprising when a movie that you expect to be formulaic turns out to be much more.Life imitating art imitating life is what 'Grudge Match' (PG-13, 1:53) is all about. The film stars two actors in their late 60s playing boxers, while both actors had famously played boxers on film in the 1980s. This movie is not Jake LaMotta versus Rocky Balboa (although that would be interesting since the former was a real person and the latter is a fictional character). This pairing of screen legends who have played boxers before and are now playing different boxers who, in the story have boxed before is plenty interesting in its own right.Sylvester Stallone is Henry 'Razor' Sharp and Robert DeNiro is Billy 'Kid' McDonnen, boxers who came up in the sport as rivals and grew to hate each other, but decide to reunite – professionally, if not personally. When the two light heavyweights first fought each other for the championship, Kid won. In the rematch, Razor won. The tie-breaking grudge match that everyone wanted to see never happened because, for very personal and private reasons, Razor retired from boxing while still in his prime.Fast-forward 30 years. Razor is living a lonely life and barely making ends meet. Kid is a local businessman who is moderately successful, but still nurses a grudge against Razor for refusing to allow him to redeem himself after his one lost fight. When a motion-capture video session for a new boxing video game featuring the two boxing legends leads to a physical confrontation that is caught on cell phone cameras and goes viral, the son (Kevin Hart) of Razor's former boxing promoter brings the two old enemies together so the world can finally see them finish what they started.But before the fight can take place, both men have to overcome their personal animosity, mend fences with others from their shared past and, of course, get their well-past-their-prime bodies into fighting shape if that's possible. Razor's old friend Louis 'Lightning' Conlon (Alan Arkin) trains Razor, while Kid is trained by his estranged son, B.J. (Jon Bernthal), who often has his precocious son Trey (Camden Gray) in tow. Kim Basinger plays Sally, a woman who has something of a history with both Razor and Kid.'Grudge Match' doesn't take the easy way out of anything – and the effort pays off. The professional, physical and personal challenges that both men face aren't easily overcome. The drama feels genuine and is perfectly balanced by well-earned laughs. Basinger (a previous Oscar winner) gives the story just the right amount of gravitas and Kevin Hart provides the comic relief, with more than a little help from Arkin and Gray, not to mention the stars themselves. Stallone and DeNiro could've mailed in their performances, but instead, they both give us some real quality acting. DeNiro is alternately funny and heart-breaking, but without falling back on his grumpy guy routine of which we've seen a little too much in the past few years. In fact, DeNiro's character is no comedian, but is the more upbeat of the two main characters. Meanwhile, Stallone is sullen, without being depressing, funny when appropriate and seems to show genuine emotion as he works through a number of personal challenges.But the appeal of this movie doesn't just come from the talented cast. The story is original enough to be engaging and is further enhanced by well-paced and balanced directing and seamless editing. The movie also contains a very appealing soundtrack, with a great mix of well-known tunes and some very cool new music. Even the film's obligatory training montage feels fresh and the climactic fight sequence manages a surprise or two. And speaking of surprises, don't be in too much of a hurry to head for the exits when the credits start to roll, or you'll miss two very clever final scenes.'Grudge Match' tells an interesting story, with plenty of laughs, scenes that'll make you smile and even a touching moment or two – and does it all with an unexpected amount of originality. This film fought through some well-worn territory and emerged as a very pleasant surprise – and with an 'A-' from me.",8,0,1,27 November 2015
Hidden Figures," Don't let 'Hidden Figures' be a hidden treasure!
","Appreciation. It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama 'Hidden Figures' (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority – and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home) – in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie – and might be too much for many – but 'Hidden Figures' is up to the challenge.The film is an adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly's book of the same name and follows three black women who worked in NASA's computer section in 1961. That's not to say that they worked on computers – THEY were the computers. Back when electronic computers (with only a fraction of the capacity and speed of today's mainframes) took up an entire room – and were just beginning to be installed in places like NASA – talented mathematicians did calculations for the space program by hand.Dorothy Vaughn (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) is a mathematician who is also mechanically-inclined, develops a talent for programming IBM computers and is a natural leader, but is denied a well-deserved supervisory position by NASA culture – and her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a brilliant mathematician who struggles to balance the demands of her increasing responsibilities at NASA with caring for her three young daughters whose father has passed away. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) is an outspoken aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer because of her lack of education, which she has difficulty overcoming because of segregation.All three women make progress in their attempts to reach their goals and fulfill their potential, but with much difficulty, based on their gender and their race. Dorothy has been managing the women of the computer section for some time, but has to fight for the title and the pay – and even takes it upon herself to learn more about NASA's newly-arrived IBM computer, while understanding that doing so could eventually cost her and her co-workers their jobs. Mary continues to make valuable contributions to NASA's efforts, while trying to work through the catch-22 of needing additional education to become an engineer, with the only nearby school offering such classes refusing to accept any black students.But most of the screen time belongs to Katherine's story. As the most talented mathematician of all of NASA's human computers, she is called up to work in NASA's Space Task Group where she works directly with the standoffish Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and is supervised by the group's director, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). Even as Katherine continues to demonstrate her capabilities, she is still subjected to drinking coffee from a pot labeled 'Colored' and having to walk 20 minutes (each way) to the building where the nearest restroom for black females is located. Eventually, she earns the respect of her peers – and comes to the attention of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) himself, who comes to trust her calculations above all others. Katherine also attracts a different kind of attention from the commander of a local Army Reserve base, Lt. Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali), who is also single. Embodying the dual meaning of the movie's title, Katherine works out the hidden figures needed for Glenn's mission and Jim doesn't mind that her figure is hidden beneath those unflattering 1960s dresses, as he comes to care more about her heart – and the very sharp mind hidden behind her even less flattering eye glasses.'Hidden Figures' is a marvelously entertaining film. The script adaptation by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi tells its true story accurately and engagingly, weaving its many story lines together seamlessly, educating and entertaining their audience throughout. Melfi also directs and uses his talented and award-worthy cast to thrill us, to make us cheer and give us moments of humor and just plain fun. I was impressed at how much this movie packed in without seeming cluttered, how much it affected me emotionally without being manipulative, and how much appreciation I gained for these women, their struggles and the importance of the times in which they lived and accomplished so much. It's also surprising that so little has been widely known about these women – until now. Don't let 'Hidden Figures' be a hidden treasure. See it soon! It's out of this world.

Sing Street," 'Sing Street' is music to the ears - and the heart.
","Few (if any) of us were who we wanted to be when we were in high school. While high school girls often think they're not pretty enough or popular enough, boys fear they're not cool enough or tough enough. Of course, these are only a few of the characteristics that teens in high school â€“ both boys and girls believe they lack. The point is, during adolescence, all kids think that they're not 'enough'Â… of something. Well, I say 'enough already' â€“ and so does Irish writer-director John Carney, through his music-oriented comedy-drama 'Sing Street' (PG-13, 1:46). This is a film that shows us it's okay to be insecure and sad sometimes, but you can also learn to be happy during those times and even to rise above them. 'Happy-Sad' the film calls it. I call the film insightful, encouraging and entertaining.Conor Lalor (Ferdia Walsh Peelo) is, in many ways, a typical 15-year-old. He goes to school, where he has both friends and enemies. He has family members who love him, but also add challenges to his life. And, of course, he wants to earn the affections of someone special who has caught his eye. The details of the framework of Conor's life may differ from yours (as well as his gender, interests, location and even time period), but he should be easy to relate to â€“ for anyone who attended (or is now attending) high school.As for Conor, he lives in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. He has a brother (six years older) named Brendan (Jack Raynor), who is out of school but still lives at home, and a younger sister named Ann (Kelly Thornton). Their parents (Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy) argue â€“ loudly â€“ about money, their kids, their marriage, etc. Conor has the experience of changing schools, starting at Synge Street Christian Brothers School, where, as the new kid, he quickly runs afoul of the principal (Don Wycherly) and the school bully (Ian Kelly). However, Conor soon makes a friend named Darren (Ben Carolan) and is quite taken by a mysterious girl named Raphina (Lucy Boynton) who lives across the street from the school.As a way of getting to know Raphina, Conor asks her to be in a music video for his band. She agrees, so now all Conor has to do isÂ… start a band! He gets Darren to be the band's manager â€“ slash â€“ music video producer. Darren introduces Conor to Eamon (Mark McKenna), who is skilled at a variety of instruments. After the guys recruit from among their school mates, adding friends Larry (Conor Hamilton) and Gary (Karl Rice), along with Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), the only black kid at Synge Street CBS, they choose 'Sing Street' as the name of their band, and start working on their band's musical and visual identity.Heavily influenced by early-mid 1980s acts like The Cure, Joe Jackson and Hall & Oates (whose songs appear in the soundtrack), Sing Street works up a cover of Duran Duran's 'Rio' and then Conor and Eamon start writing original songs together. Brendan makes use of his misspent youth to school his younger brother in the finer points of modern music and encourages Conor to stretch musically. Soon, Raphina becomes Conor's muse and a regular in Sing Street's videos. Raphina and Conor also grow closer, in spite of her 'it's complicated' relationship status and her plan to move to London to model.'Sing Street' features a whole lot of talent â€“ on both sides of the camera â€“ and the microphone. Carney's direction and his script are sensitive, engaging and fun. The story has a lot going on, but still keeps things simple, and derives its entertainment value from a variety of sources. The drama comes from following the development of the band, the relationship between Conor and Raphina, the relationships within Conor's house and Conor's problems at school. The comedy comes from the behavior of the film's colorful characters and the natural awkwardness of teenagers discovering life.Carney says the film is 'wish fulfillment of all of the things I wanted when I was the age of the character and didn't do.' To portray a fictionalized version of his own adolescence, he cast unknown, but talented actors â€“ with terrific results. Raynor creates an interesting and passionate character, who is dealing with the fear that life is passing him by. For their part, Walsh-Peelo and McKenna, besides being fine young actors, are talented musicians in real life â€“ all the better to perform the film's excellent original songs.As the main character, Conor's struggles are relatable, his dreams are understandable and his story is enjoyable. The film isn't completely original or realistic, but it's very effective as a representation of the trials, tribulations and potential triumphs of the teenage years, and offers hope as to what could lie ahead â€“ for those who make the most of those years â€“ and the lessons they produce. 'You can never do anything by half,' is one character's heart-felt proclamation. 'Sing Street' continually speaks to the heart â€“ through its comedy, its drama and its wonderful music â€“ and doesn't do it by half. 'A-'",8,21,28,8 May 2016
Prisoners," 'Prisoners' will captivate any parent and thrill any audience.
","This may sound obvious or trite, but it truly is a parent's worst nightmare: Your child just disappears, suddenly and without a trace. That's the scenario in the crime drama/thriller 'Prisoners' (R, 2:33).When the young daughters of two neighbors go out to play after their families share Thanksgiving dinner together and then no one can find the girls, the panic is immediate and gut-wrenching. The helplessness of these two sets of parents (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch) is compounded when the police release a person of interest named Alex Jones (played brilliantly by Paul Dano) for lack of evidence. Despite the fact that Alex has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, Keller is convinced that Alex knows something. He takes matters into his own hands and goes much farther than even the most devoted of parents could imagine. Keller is willing to do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to extract the information he needs to find these two little girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is doing what he can to solve the case, and even seems willing to go a little outside the law to do it, but keeps coming up empty.The tension gradually but steadily builds as these parents know that time is running out for their missing children. Clues in the case are scant and hints as to where this story is going are there on the screen, but seem too trivial to matter – until they do. The plot twists and ultimate reveals are shocking, but the film's real power is in the questions it forces us to ask – and keep asking after the film is over. The script is smart enough to provide us sufficient closure to justify the emotional investment we've made in this story, but still leaves it open-ended enough to give us something to think about after the credits roll. The unusually long run time may make you feel like a prisoner, but the complex, well-directed and very well-acted story (mostly) justifies the film's length. 'B+'",7,1,2,20 October 2015
Silence," 'Silence' is an impressive historical epic which suffers from the lack of a clear message.
","Martin Scorsese's historical drama 'Silence' (R, 2:41) is set in a place, during a time and in a set of circumstances with which most 21st century westerners are unfamiliar, making it difficult for many Movie Fans to appreciate without a little background: From 1603 to 1867, Japan was ruled by a series of military dictators which held the title of shogun and were all from the Tokugawa clan. Early in the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan opened itself up to trade from Europe, which brought in new weaponry like the musket, and also led to the arrival of Christian missionaries. The shoguns soon began to feel that the spread of Christianity in Japan was a threat to their authority. By 1635, Japan passed a series of Seclusion Laws severely restricting trade and immigration. They also passed laws banning Christianity, which led to a Japanese inquisition to discover, torture and even kill practicing Japanese Christians.Based on the 1966 novel of the same name written by Japanese Catholic Shūsaku Endō (and made into feature films in 1971 and 1996), 'Silence' is the story of three Portuguese Jesuit Catholic priests and their experiences in 17th century Japan. When Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson), a famous missionary to Japan, stops writing and is rumored to have publicly abandoned his faith, or apostatized, two of his students, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) volunteer to go to Japan to learn the truth, find Father Ferreira and, if necessary, save his soul.Rodrigues and Garupe get a drunken Japanese apostate named Kichijiro (Yōsuke Kubozuka) to help them sneak into Japan. The priests are enthusiastically greeted by Japanese peasants who had been earlier converted to Christianity, then driven underground by the Tokugawa shogunate's persecution. The villagers hide and protect the priests and the priests minister to the villagers by hearing their confessions and baptizing them. Word of the priests' presence soon spreads, which leads to increased demand for their services among the populace – and increased danger from the local Nagasaki-area Inquisitor who is also looking for the priests – and is willing to torture and kill in order to find them.The persecution of Japanese Christians takes a variety of forms as military and government officials try to stamp out the influence of the religion throughout the country. These officials often lay on the ground a stone carving representing Jesus on the cross and demand that accused Christians step on it as a way of denouncing the faith. Those who refuse are subjected to a variety of tortures, often ending in death, making many of them martyrs. As the local governor, Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata), explains, the Japanese have learned that it's more effective to get priests themselves to apostatize, so the officials use the lives of their own people as leverage to try to get the priests to comply. As the priests pray to God for help and wisdom, they become increasingly distressed that they're met mainly with silence.'Silence' is an impressive historical epic which suffers from the lack of a clear message. As such movies often do, this one transports Movie Fans to a different time and place where we can learn a lot and be engaged by a little-known story. In this case, the story is true (with the priests based on actual historical figures, but with some details of their lives changed) and the acting is terrific, but the message is muddled. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, all I'll say is that both religious and non-religious Movie Fans will identify with some of the characters, but many will get to the closing credits wondering what the film was really about and what the point of watching it was. Beyond the quality of the filmmaking and the educational value of the movie, when it comes to singing its praises as an entertaining experience, all you'll hear from me is silence.

Logan," 'Logan' brings Wolverine's story to a satisfying conclusion, but it's only somewhat entertaining.
","The Wolverine is one of the most popular characters in the history of comic books. He has been ranked #4 by IGN (Imagine Games Network) and #1 by 'Wizard' magazine. The brooding X-Man mutant with the long, retractable claws and healing powers has been featured in several Marvel comic book series since the 1970s, not to mention video games, TV series and, of course, films. Hugh Jackman has played the character in almost all of the X-Men films, including three based solely on his character. In 2009, 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' takes the character from his childhood in 1840s Canada through several wars and into league with Professor Xavier and the X-Men. 2013's 'Wolverine' is set mostly in modern Japan and sees the title character struggling with the 'curse' of his invulnerability. 2017's 'Logan' (R, 2:17) is inspired by the 2008 graphic novel 'Old Man Logan'. It takes place in the near future, shows an aging Wolverine as anything but invulnerable and is intended to be the character's final appearance on film.2029. El Paso, Texas. Wolverine / Logan (Jackman) is working as a limo driver. He's not the mutant he once was. Far from it. The alloy adamantium, which gave his skeleton and claws such strength, is poisoning him. He's slowly dying. And he's not the only one. For a variety of reasons, mutants everywhere are dying off and Charles Xavier / Professor X himself (Patrick Stewart) seems set to join them soon. Logan has Xavier stashed at an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Juarez, Mexico. A mutant called Caliban (Stephen Merchant) is caring for the ailing Professor and Logan brings him medications that he purchases illegally in El Paso. Xavier is suffering from a form of dementia and, when he has one of his seizures, the powers of his mind that had served him so well in the past, cause tremors and considerable discomfort for those nearby. It's not a happy life for any of these men, but it is a quiet, anonymous and relatively peaceful one. That is, until Logan's past catches up to him once again.Logan is surprised to encounter Laura (Dafne Keen), an 11-year-old mutant who needs Logan's help, but he wants no part of her problems. Gabriella (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a nurse at a secret surgical clinic called Transigen, begs Logan to help Laura get to North Dakota, to a place called Eden, which is supposed to be a refuge for young mutants. Laura is being pursued by Transigen's evil surgical head, Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), and his ruthless head of security, Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), who has with him a private army of cybernetic soldiers called the Reavers. Soon, Logan has no choice but to step up and protect Xavier and Laura. What follows is a road trip from hell, with Reavers in hot pursuit, Logan and Xavier both suffering physically and mentally and with some major revelations along the way.'Logan' brings Wolverine's story to a satisfying conclusion, but it's only somewhat entertaining. The tone seems darker and more violent than previous Wolverine movies (if that's possible). There's plenty of action, including fight scenes with generous amounts of blood and gore, but the story is smaller, more personal and more emotional. It's a good mix of action-driven and character-driven, but can be difficult to watch. It's almost overwhelmingly depressing, the extreme violence cheapens human life more than most action movies and the frequent use of adult language (all of it involving children) is disturbing. Wolverine fans may enjoy this final chapter, but there are better action movies out there. 'C+'",4,4,15,3 March 2017
La La Land," 'La La Land' is a wonderful and refreshing, but imperfect film.
","In real life, most people don't randomly break out in song and dance, but the escapism of the big screen has been bringing Movie Fans musical feature films since the very first days of the sound motion picture. Only the second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture was a musical (1929's 'The Broadway Melody'). Oversaturation in the marketplace and changing audience tastes led to the production of fewer musicals, but they never went away. Some of the best-loved musicals in film history (e.g. 'Meet Me in St. Louis' and 'Singin' in the Rain') came out in the 10-year span 1944-1953. But the ensuing decades each produced very popular musicals: 'West Side Story', 'The Sound of Music' and 'Oliver!' (all Best Picture Oscar winners from the 1960s), 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory', 'Grease' and 'All That Jazz' (1970s), 'Victor/Victoria', 'Little Shop of Horrors' and 'The Little Mermaid' (1980s), 'Beauty and the Beast', 'The Lion King' and 'Evita' (1990s) and, in the early 2000s, 'Moulin Rouge!', 'Frozen', 'Dreamgirls' and 'Chicago', which became the first musical in 34 years to win Best Picture.2016's 'La La Land' (PG-13, 2:08) is the purest original (non-adapted) live action musical in many years, and has both the pedigree and the quality to duplicate the accomplishment of 2002's 'Chicago'. 'La La Land' was written and directed by Damien Chazelle, who was the writer-director of 2014's 'Whiplash', which earned him Oscar nods for his script and his film. This one is filled with original songs which are composed and orchestrated by Chazelle's previous collaborator, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics by the award-winning musical theater team known as Pasek and Paul. Musician John Legend has a major role in the film and its stars, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are both past Oscar nominees who earlier appeared together in two other movies – 2011's 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' and 2013's 'Gangster Squad'. And, yes, they both sing and dance while telling this particular musical's story of romance, dreams and hope. It takes place in the present but feels like a throwback - like the most entertaining musicals of yesteryear.The film's title has a dual meaning: (1) referring to people who live their lives in a seemingly unrealistic dream world and (2) the city of Los Angeles itself, where most of the action takes place. In fact, the film opens with a song-and-dance number with commuters stuck on a typically grid-locked L.A. highway. At the very end of that scene, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Stone) has a random, brief and unpleasant encounter with struggling jazz keyboardist, Sebastian Wilder (Gosling), who acts like a real pianist. The two run into each other again in Sebastian's jazz club, immediately after he's fired by the club owner (J.K. Simmons) for insisting on playing his own music. Sebastian is no more polite this time. The two finally 'meet cute' and before long, Mia has left her roommates behind and moved in with Sebastian.Neither life nor love go smoothly for this pair of stubborn dreamers, but they sure do try hard at both. Mia continues working as a barista on the Warner Bros. studio lot and going to frustrating audition after frustrating audition. Eventually, she decides that her best way forward is to write, finance and produce a one-woman show which, fittingly, focuses on her experiences of leaving her hometown in Nevada and moving to La La Land to pursue her dreams. After dropping the humorously humiliating job where Mia sees him at their third encounter, Sebastian continues to hold fast to his dream of opening his own jazz club, but doesn't really do much about it. He reluctantly takes a job on keys in a music group run by an old acquaintance (Legend), but doesn't enjoy it because they don't play his style of pure jazz. Sebastian's unhappiness turns to resentment and ends up being directed toward Mia, just as her show is about to open. The eventual resolution of their love story and their individual pursuit of their dreams feels right for a movie which celebrates dreamers, but shows what happens when life doesn't go as we've planned.'La La Land' is a wonderful movie, but not, as some reviewers would lead you to believe, flawless. After three contentious encounters, the two main characters just suddenly fall in love, a development that isn't very well earned by the script or the acting. Otherwise, the performances are excellent (especially Stone's) and the script is funny, poignant and grounded except for that whole thing about characters suddenly breaking into song. But when they do, those songs are both fun and touching. The dancing, however, seems to lack some of the energy and joy that you find in the older Hollywood musicals that inspired this film. Having said all that, I have to put these relatively minor criticisms into perspective: This is a very entertaining and affecting movie. You'll likely be emotionally invested in these characters, smile a lot – and leave the theater wanting the soundtrack. For someone who wants more variety and positivity in today's films, this one is a gift. 'A-'",8,14,29,20 October 2016
Snowden," 'Snowden' is an interesting, informative and well-told, but one-sided portrayal of the infamous NSA leaker.
","The story of NSA leaker / whistleblower Edward Snowden has been told before, but never like this. Books have been published, magazine articles have been written, songs have been sung, a graphic novel has been illustrated and even an action figure created depicting the man responsible for the biggest leak of classified documents in U.S. history. Then, of course, there are the movies. Documentaries on Snowden include 'Citizenfour', which won the 2014 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. The highest profile feature-length drama to date about this highly controversial figure is 2016's 'Snowden' (R, 2:14) starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and directed by Oscar-winner Oliver Stone, who based his screenplay on two books about his title character and had a series of meetings with Snowden while in exile in Russia.Two days before the film's official U.S. release, in select cities around the country, special screenings were held, in conjunction with a live interview with the film's stars and director in New York, as well as Edward Snowden himself, via satellite from Moscow. 'The amount of care' that went into the movie, said Snowden, 'is reassuring.' Stone acknowledged the complexity of the story, saying that it took quite a few visits with Snowden to get the details right. 'It took time to really absorb this stuff,' said Stone. Gordon-Levitt, who does a great job of imitating Snowden's voice and mannerisms, talked about how Snowden's parents thanked him for his portrayal of their son when the actor met them at the film's New York premiere. For his part, Snowden discussed why he revealed the U.S. government's intrusive surveillance of its own citizens and others saying, 'Privacy is the right to the self.' That is what he feels that his activities have helped to protect. All these themes and more are on display in Stone's film.The time and place that is at the center of the film is Snowden's discussions with journalists (played by Tom Wilkinson and Zachary Quinto) in a Hong Kong hotel room, as they all strategized about the release of the documents that Snowden took from the NSA site where he worked. All the while, filmmaker Laura Poitras (Oscar winner Melissa Leo) is capturing the video that she'll later use in 'Citizenfour'. As the group inches closer to the fateful moment of breaking one of the biggest stories of the decade, the film portrays periods of time in Snowden's life which eventually led to him hiding in Hong Kong, before going on to Russia. We see Snowden's Army training, his CIA training and service in Geneva and his employment as an NSA contractor in Japan, Maryland and, finally, at a top secret facility in Hawaii.There were just a few constants during these experiences in Snowden's life. One of those was his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley). Stone sees the portrayal of Ed and Lindsay's relationship as what kept the film from being 'a hard, cold movie which could almost look like a documentary.' We see Snowden mentored by his first CIA instructor (Rhys Ifans) and, to a lesser extent, by a CIA employee played by Nicolas Cage. The film also features Snowden's abiding desire to serve his country and his patriotism, which is what he says led him to expose the NSA's data collection programs. All of this serves to humanize Snowden. 'Until this movie, none of us really knew the story of Ed the human,' said Woodley. Regardless of what you think about this man or the things he did while working for our government, what Woodley said is indeed what we get – a more human picture of Edward Snowden.'Snowden' is a well-constructed human story, albeit a one-sided portrayal. Aided by excellent performances, especially from Gordon-Levitt and Woodley, we feel like we get to know these characters and what makes them tick, as we follow Snowden's gradual transition from someone who completely supported his government's actions in the post-9/11 world, to a man who became disillusioned with the government's activities conducted in the name of national security. The script, co-written by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald, gives us just enough of the computer activity to help us understand what's going on, but doesn't let us get lost in technical jargon (although there are times when the movie walks a very fine line). The political and privacy issues are well-addressed, but little attention is given to explanations of why the government did the things it did the way it did them, or the widespread repercussions of Snowden's actions. If you're looking to learn and understand more about Edward Snowden's story and the privacy issues he raised, or if you just want to see a well-written and well-acted drama-thriller, then this is your movie, but if you'd like a deeper or a more objective version of this story, keep looking.

Beauty and the Beast," 'Beauty and the Beast' is a faithful, entertaining and beautiful live-action rendition of the beloved Disney animated classic.
","Most people are aware that Disney's 2017 musical fantasy 'Beauty and the Beast' (PG, 2:09) is a live-action remake of the studio's 1991 animated classic, but what is not as well known is just how successful that 1991 version was – or how long the story has been around. According to Wikipedia, university researchers in Europe have traced the story's origins back 4,000 years! A little more recently, it's likely that the tale (which seems like it just may be nearly as old as time) was influenced by the true story of Petrus Gonsalvus, a 16th century Spaniard who suffered from Hypertrichosis (extreme hair growth), but married a Parisian woman, fathered seven children (four of whom inherited his disease) and lived among the French nobility. Regardless of its original source, the story was first published in France in 1740 and, over the next three centuries, was revised, rewritten and adapted, both in print and then as performance art, including about a dozen television shows and about the same number of feature films. Probably the most famous cinematic version was Disney's 1991 animated musical which won Oscars for its score and its title song (and was nominated for Best Picture – the very first animated feature so honored) and made almost half a billion dollars worldwide. That 1991 film incorporates several elements and plot points from the story's early published versions. The 2017 version does the same – and serves as a very faithful live-action re-telling of the 1991 classic, with few significant differences.Emma Watson plays Belle (the character simply referred to as Beauty in most of the earlier versions of the story), a beautiful, kind, intelligent and independent young woman living in the fictional French village of Villeneuve (named after the author who first published the story). Belle lives with her eccentric and devoted widowed father, Maurice (Kevin Kline), who is the only one who understands Belle and accepts her for who she is. While her fellow villagers dismiss her as 'odd' for always reading books and dreaming about life and adventures beyond Villeneuve, she is nevertheless being pursued romantically by arrogant former soldier Gaston (Luke Evans), who sees Belle's beauty as at least approaching his own. (To say that Gaston's narcissistic is like saying Donald Trump is kind of proud of his accomplishments.) And not that Gaston's ego needs any boosting, but constantly at his side is LeFou (Josh Gad), who basically serves as Gaston's hype man and who seems jealous of all the local maidens competing for Gaston's attention. Regardless, Gaston wants Belle and Belle wants... nothing to do with Gaston.Meanwhile, the other character in the film's title is wasting away in a long-forgotten castle deep in the woods outside of Villeneuve. Beast (Dan Stevens) is a former prince who is now a unique fusion of several different wild animals, due to a curse he received from a local enchantress because of his extreme self-centeredness. Trapped in the same curse are his former castle staff, who now exist as anthropomorphic household objects including a candelabra named Lumière (voiced by Ewan McGregor), a clock called Cogsworth (Ian McKellan), a tea pot (Emma Thompson), a harpsicord (Stanley Tucci), a dresser (Audra McDonald) and a feather duster (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The only way that any (all) of them can be released from the curse is if Beast falls in love and is loved in return, before a rose that was given to Beast as a symbol of the curse loses its last petal. Considering that Beast has grown bitter and mean and no one even knows that he exists, the long-term prospects for this cursed castle don't look good.Of course, all that changes when these two worlds inevitably collide. (After all, movies simply called 'Beast', or 'Beauty And' don't sound very interesting, do they?) When Maurice gets lost in the woods on the way back from his annual trip to market, he ends up at Beast's castle, where he takes a rose to bring to Belle and is promptly imprisoned in Beast's dungeon. When Maurice's faithful horse returns to Villeneuve and Belle hops on, she also discovers Beast's castle. She insists on taking her father's place in the dungeon, so Beast throws him out and holds Belle captive. As Maurice struggles to get Gaston (or any of the villagers) to help him rescue Belle (or even to believe his story of a beast living in a castle deep in the woods), Beast's staff insists that Belle be their guest, and they work to convince Beast to be nice enough to her that she might turn out to be the one to break the curse before it's too late.'Beauty and the Beast' is a faithful, entertaining and beautiful live-action rendition of the beloved Disney animated classic. The 2017 version keeps the time-honored songs from the 1991 film and adds a few new ones. With the advances in CGI since 1991, director Bill Condon and his team are able to replicate and update the look of the animated version. In addition, the great voice work wonderfully complements the vibrant visuals, while the characters' diversity (in terms of race and sexual orientation) also represents an update of sorts. The result of all this is a remake that is every bit as magical and fun as the original. There is little here that's fresh or new, but there's a lot to appreciate and enjoy.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original.
","'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' (PG-13, 2:16), much like its predecessor, is one of the most creative movie mash-ups ever. When I reviewed the original, I noted how much it had in common with 'Star Wars'. My 2014 review called it, 'a movie about a group of rebels of different races getting together to save a planet from the power of a mysterious deadly orb,' described the group as including 'a good-looking outlaw pilot who is used to only thinking of himself, a large brown creature who makes sounds that others seem to understand as a sort of language, a tough woman with a royal background who has no patience for nonsense and a small, wise creature who provides guidance to the others.' To all that, add significant daddy issues and you have the Guardians films. Well, plus aspects of 'Star Trek' (discovering strange new worlds), 'Independence Day' (several people playing crucial roles in defeating interstellar evil) and even 'The Fast and the Furious' (a diverse group of friends regarded as family).And let's not forget that Guardians is a Marvel property. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is the 15th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie contains Easter eggs tying it to other Marvel film franchises and hints at future cinematic overlap. In terms of how this one fits with the others chronologically, according to IMDb, 'the film takes place in 2014, 3 months after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). It takes place a year after Thor: The Dark World (2013). Before or after Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and a year before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).' Speaking of Tony Stark's cohorts, shortly before the first Guardians movie was released, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said that the goal with this franchise was actually to create 'another Avengers'. The Guardian series does have that feel to it, along with some of the comic sensibilities of 'Deadpool', another Marvel film franchise born in the mid-2010s. Now, having said all that (and ensuing cinematic cross-pollination notwithstanding), the Guardians movies have definitely created their own niche within the MCU – and their own sense of fun.Picking up just months after the action in the original, 'Vol. 2' sees Peter Quill / Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) adjusting to their newfound fame, their role as galaxy guardians and the dynamics of (and their individual places within) this team – slash – family unit. Early on, four of them battle a monster known as the Abilisk (looking like a much bigger and angrier Jabba the Hutt – with tentacles) while Groot dances to Quill's music. A gold-colored race of people known as the Sovereign reward the Guardians for defeating Abilisk – and protecting the special batteries that it was trying to steal – by turning over a prisoner, Nebula (Karen Gillan), Gamora's estranged sister, who has a bounty on her head. As the Guardians leave the Sovereign, Rocket steals some of those valuable batteries. The insult of such a theft sends Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) into a rage and she sends her fleet of remotely-piloted drones after Rocket and company. Due to some nifty flying – and a little help from a mysterious ship which suddenly comes to their aid – the Guardians survive, but crash land on an unfamiliar planet.That mysterious ship lands on the planet too and out steps a being called Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Quill's father! Ego's story seems to check out, so Quill, Gamora and Drax let Ego take them back to his planet so Quill can spend some time with his pops. Rocket is left behind to repair the ship, take care of Baby Groot and keep an eye on Nebula. As Quill and friends get to know Ego – and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Ego's pet empath (a being who can experience the feelings of other people by touching them and even temporarily alter those feelings), Rocket has to defend against an attack by Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his crew of Ravegers, whom Ayesha has hired to retrieve the batteries and kill the Guardians. The Ravegers capture Rocket and Groot, but Yondu's reluctance to pursue Quill leads to a mutiny by Yondu's crew. His lieutenant, who calls himself Taserface (Chris Sullivan), imprisons Yondu, Rocket and Groot, gets rid of those loyal to Yondu and teams up with Nebula to catch up with the rest of the Guardians, who, in the meantime, have run into some pretty serious trouble of their own.'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original. In the first movie, the Guardians became a family, but in this one, they have to learn how to BE a family – while Quill and Gamora each have to deal with serious conflicts stemming from their own original families. Freed from the confines of establishing the Guardians' cinematic world and forming their relationships gives returning writer/director James Gunn the freedom to do more interesting things with the story – and the characters, which are now more developed – and more entertaining – especially Groot, who's as adorable as any Minion, but much tougher (which also happens to be pretty adorable). The music is great, while the scenery is vibrant and the action is exciting (and deserving of 3D viewing). Sometimes, there's almost too much going on visually, but also aurally, as the sound effects and music compete for attention with the dialog. As a whole, Vol. 2 is a good step forward for the franchise and (with help from five short scenes and embedded graphics during and after the closing credits) builds anticipation for more Guardian adventures, including some Marvel-ous crossover action.

The Witch," 'The Witch' is a stylistically inventive cautionary tale, but is lacking in basic entertainment value.
","1692, Salem Village and environs, within England's newly-renamed American colony, the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Political upheaval, town and family rivalries, religious disagreements, constant fear of Indian attacks, and some individuals' psychological and medical conditions created a perfect New England storm that exploded into what history calls the Salem Witch Trials. Based on unquestioned belief in the Bible, these colonists believed in the literal existence of witches and demons. Stemming from a lack of scientific knowledge, the Puritans also ascribed many natural occurrences to God or the Devil, depending on the prevailing opinions in their society. And, finally, the lack of separation of church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that their government wrote and executed laws (and sometimes executed their people) based on their religious principles. The result of all this was a mass hysteria which occupied the colony's governmental apparatus and legal system for over a year and led to the killing of 20 accused witches. Now, having said all that, I have to tell you that 'The Witch' (R, 1:33) is not about the Salem Witch Trials. However, taking place in the same general area 32 years before the witchcraft hysteria in and around Salem Village, all the same elements play out in the life of one Puritan family.William Nolastname (Ralph Ineson) is an extremely pious man, so pious that the leaders of Massachusetts Bay invite him to take his family and leave. (This is kind of like ISIS breaking away from Al Qaeda for not being radical enough.) William happily packs up a horse-drawn cart and takes his wife, Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), and son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), the younger twins, Jonas and Mercy (Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger) and baby Samuel even further out into the wilderness. They establish a homestead in the shadow of a deep, dark forest, but, despite their fervent prayers, things aren't going quite as well for them as they would've hoped.Life is tough in colonial America and it's even tougher when you're a day's ride away from anyone else. William's crops fail and the hunting ain't so good either. Then, baby Samuel disappears. One moment he's enjoying watching Thomasin playing peek-a-boo with him and the next, he's just gone. The family assumes he was taken away by a wolf, but the audience knows that the reality is even more frightening. As the family members venture into those forbidding woods looking for answers (and food), things go from bad to worse. Caleb disappears, family members reveal uncomfortable secrets to each other and as their stresses and insecurities build, serious accusations of witchcraft are tossed around.'The Witch' is a stylistically inventive cautionary tale, but is lacking in basic entertainment value. The characters speak in Old English (think: King James Version of the Bible) and with antiquated British accents. This makes the dialog simultaneously interesting and hard to decipher (although it does get easier as the movie progresses). The acting is outstanding which, when combined with the small setting and even smaller cast, gives a realistic, even voyeuristic feel to the action. The plot, however, is intentionally un-realistic. First time feature film writer-director Robert Eggers has based the dialogue on actual official records and personal journals of the time period, and his story, on popular folklore and superstitions of the day. The result is a film that's original, but convoluted, and has open-ended plot points that call to mind a more European style of filmmaking which many Americans find frustrating. With a terrific cast and original (or at least, unusual) tone and style, along with great educational value (in understanding how something like the Salem Witch Trials could have happened) and relevant lessons as they relate to the dangers of religious extremism in the modern world, 'The Witch' is just a little too overwrought and unsatisfying for me to call it 'entertaining' and recommend it.

Steve Jobs," Like the real Steve Jobs' accomplishments, the accomplishment that is the film 'Steve Jobs' isn't perfect, but at least in my MacBook, they both earn the label of genius.
","When you watch the movie 'Steve Jobs' (R, 2:02), you are witnessing genius. That's a word that shouldn't be used lightly, but here it fits – on multiple levels. The subject of this biopic is basically universally considered a genius for bringing personal computing into the homes of average people and changing our lives in other ways as well. But Jobs himself is only the most obvious example of genius in this particular motion picture. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote the TV shows 'The West Wing' and 'The Newsroom' and films including 'A Few Good Men', 'The Social Network' and 'Moneyball', once again shows his own genius for writing dialog and constructing scenes in which interactions among people become high drama. If anything, in the script for this film, he tops himself by giving the story a unique presentation. Add all that to the inspired direction of Oscar winner Danny Boyle (who won for directing 2007's Best Picture Oscar Winner 'Slumdog Millionaire'), plus brilliant acting, and you have a film with genius to spare. Genius, however, doesn't necessarily equal perfection.Steve Jobs, visionary genius that he was, was far from perfect – as an individual or a businessman. He had a daughter with college girlfriend Chrisann Brennan, but denied paternity for years. Even after he accepted Lisa Brennan as his daughter, he had almost as much trouble relating to her as he did relating to others in his life. Think of a derogatory term, anatomical or otherwise, that people apply to males they don't like, and Steve Jobs has been called it. Loyal to only a very few, no one was safe from Jobs' rudeness, often unreasonable demands or contempt when they disagreed with him. And let's not forget that, at Apple, he developed the Macintosh, which flopped. He got fired from Apple, founded NeXT Computer and developed the NeXT Box computer, which also flopped. Even geniuses make mistakes, but what recommends them as geniuses, in the 20/20 hindsight of history, are the final results and long-term impact of their accomplishments. Steve Jobs scores undeniably high marks in those areas.The triumphs and tragedies, successes and failures, mistakes and mayhem in Steve Jobs' life, as described above, are all part of the film 'Steve Jobs', but are encapsulated in a unique way. The movie takes place immediately before three crucial product launches staged in large auditoriums. The settings are the unveiling of the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Box in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. In each case, Jobs (played by Michael Fassbender), with his long-suffering PR manager, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), at his side, he interacts with Chrisann (Katherine Waterston) and their daughter, Lisa (played at five, ten and nineteen by Perla Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo, and Makenzie Moss) as well as his partner in founding Apple, Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), Macintosh designer, Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Apple CEO, John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) plus others, through the various stages of warmth, apathy and conflict between them and Jobs at these specific moments in time. The movie gives us these three main scenes, adds a few brief flashback scenes to illustrate other important moments in Jobs' professional life, and that's basically the movie. If that doesn't sound interesting, it's most likely due to my lack of genius in communicating the true genius of Sorkin, Boyle and many others associated with this film.'Steve Jobs' is a terrific cinematic experience. Although Sorkin's writing fabricates conversations for dramatic purposes, many of the people portrayed in the film have admitted that those conversations reflect events and feelings that were valid at those moments, and the script is vintage Sorkin. He has a particular genius for telling a story mainly through conversations which he manages to make dramatic, insightful and humorous – and this may be his best work ever. Boyle's direction, plus some creative and skillful editing, bring the script to life wonderfully and Boyle gets consistently remarkable work from his actors in roles large and small. The acting is of such high quality across the board, that it's very tough to single out just one or two actors for special praise amid a long list of award-worthy performances. A few moments in the film do feel like they're walking a line between believable and unrealistic, but those moments are few and far between. Like the real Steve Jobs' accomplishments, the accomplishment that is the film 'Steve Jobs' isn't perfect, but at least in my MacBook, they both earn the label of genius. 'A'",9,0,4,24 October 2015
12 Years a Slave," '12 Years a Slave' offers a fresh and very human perspective on slavery.
","One problem with movies about slavery is that, in order to portray its dehumanizing evils, there seems to be no way around dehumanizing its characters. '12 Years a Slave' (R, 2:14) manages to solve this problem. While making the lives of slaves look and feel more real than most portrayals of the subject, this film also manages to humanize the slaves' suffering â€“ and underlying dignity â€“ more effectively than I've ever seen it done before. Besides all this, the film educates its audience about a topic as well-known as slavery by showing a permutation of its injustice that has rarely, if ever, appeared on screen before.This film tells the true story of Solomon Northrup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an educated, black middle-class family man who lived in upstate New York, until he was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South. He ends up serving two different masters (Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Fassbender). The former is relatively kind and the latter is very cruel (but, interestingly, both are seen using the Bible â€“ in different ways â€“ to keep their slaves under control, one of the many ways in which this film smartly puts slavery's injustices and contradictions on full display). Solomon encounters a variety of other people who are party to his confinement and occupy various spots on the morality continuum (including brief but powerful performances by Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano and Brad Pitt). Solomon's intelligence helps him to survive, but does little to solve the problem of his captivity. It's not that he doesn't try to regain his freedom, but the system is so stacked against him that every idea he considers and every plan he hatches crumbles before his eyes, steadily eating away at his remaining hope of freedom.The film's title makes it obvious that Solomon isn't still a slave at the movie's end. How that freedom comes about is the question (for those of us previously unfamiliar with the history on which the film is based). Does Solomon escape? Is he freed by a sympathetic master? Is he discovered in captivity by someone who knows that he was a free man? Does his freedom come as naturally as it did for millions of other slaves in the Antebellum South - by death? Whether you know the ending, figure it out during the course of the movie or just sit back and absorb the story as it unfolds, Solomon's experiences in his brutal and tragic enslavement, offer plenty to watch as we wait to see how these 12 Years will end.This film's uniqueness in its depiction of slavery is brilliantly executed by screenwriter John Ridley and director Steve McQueen. Ridley's dialog effectively portrays the relative intelligence of his disparate characters and reminds us of the eloquence with which many Americans used to speak, sounding almost Shakespearean at times. McQueen makes the audience feel like they're part of the action by bringing his camera in very close at certain carefully chosen moments, and pacing the film in such a way that the characters' emotions become our own, including the very uncomfortable feeling of being off balance, not knowing what's coming next. The star's performance was so strong that, when the 2013-2014 awards season arrived, we all had to learn to pronounce Chiwetel Ejiofor, much as, one year earlier, we had to learn the name of the young 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' star QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis (who, interestingly, is also in this film). Although '12 Years a Slave' drags at times and stages its final scene rather awkwardly, overall, the film is a masterwork of story-telling and emotional resonance. 'A-'",8,0,1,3 December 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Friends, Romans, Movie Fans, lend me your ears, for I would like to 'Hail, Caesar!'
","When we go to the movies, we want to feel that we got our money's worth, right? Well, here's a film that gives us more for our money than most films. For the price of admission to this one movie: 'Hail, Caesar!' (PG-13, 1:46), we get two directors and two screenwriters (brothers Joel and Ethan Cohen), three Oscar winners (George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton) and three previous Oscar nominees (Josh Brolin, Ralph Fiennes and Jonah Hill), the third appearance by Josh Brolin in a Coen Brother's film, Clooney's fourth such gig, the fifth movie in which Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have both appeared – and five films within a film! We also get three satires for the price of one as this movie gently parodies (but does not pillory) religion, Hollywood's communist witch hunt of the 1950s and the Golden Age of Hollywood itself. Actually, the film's content seems to me like a comedic version of the Oscar-nominated 2015 film 'Trumbo'. There's a lot going on in 'Hail, Caesar!' Of course, the most important question now is, whether all this quantity equals quality.Brolin stars as a loose interpretation of Eddie Mannix, a real-life Hollywood 'fixer' in the 40s and 50s. During this one day in his life working as an executive for the fictional movie studio Capitol Pictures, Eddie has a lot to deal with, both professionally and personally. In his personal life, he's feeling guilty about his failed attempts to quit smoking and the lies he tells his wife about it (not to mention the toll that his long hours at the studio are taking on his family life) and he's weighing a lucrative job offer to leave Hollywood behind and help run Lockheed Aviation. On the studio lot, Eddie has to deal with a weather-delayed shoot at a remote location and a producer who needs a new male star for his current production (and a director who's not happy with Eddie's choice). Eddie's also consulting a disparate group of religious leaders on the historical and theological validity of the studio's current biblical epic, and handling an unmarried star who just started filming a new movie and is pregnant, twin sisters who are competing entertainment journalists (Swinton in both roles), a slew of celebrity-oriented rumors and, most troubling of all, the sudden and mysterious disappearance of that epic's star, Baird Whitlock.Baird (Clooney) has been kidnapped. He was just a couple scenes away from completing his role as a Roman military commander in the aforementioned biblical epic, entitled 'Hail, Caesar!' – and is still dressed in his full ancient Roman regalia when he's taken. Baird is a well-known drunk and womanizer, but that doesn't help Eddie figure out where he is or when he'll be back. Then, a ransom note arrives at the studio. The note asks for $100,000 and is signed by a group calling themselves 'The Future'. (No, this isn't a time travel movie.) Baird's captors are actually a relatively peaceful group of people who treat him fairly well. Of course, Baird's current condition is unknown to Eddie and doesn't solve the problem of a major production falling behind schedule. Also in on the secret of Baird's disappearance is Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrereich), another of his studio's stars. Despite suddenly being pulled from filming a western to act in a period drama for director Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes) – and being comically bad in a serious role (and not the brightest bulb in the socket), Hobie wants to help the studio any way he can. In the midst of all this, we get to see humorous scenes in which Johannson and Tatum are each filming their respective movies and Hill gets a short, but amusing scene as an office nerd who helps fixers.'Hail, Caesar!' is definitely a Coen Brothers movie. More than an obvious statement of fact, that sentence will likely carry a lot of meaning to many Movie Fans. This film is full of quirky characters, clever dialog, smart satire, catchy original songs and excellent actors who are Coen Brothers regulars (including Joel's wife, Frances McDormand, in a small role). All that, combined with the fun 'movie within a movie' scenes, make for one entertaining motion picture. I liked this movie very much, but I wanted to like it more than I did. As with most other Coen Brothers comedies, I would've appreciated a few more laughs and a somewhat tighter plot, but I still think that this film is one of their best. 'A-'",8,5,16,5 February 2016
12 Strong," an entertaining and compelling story of real-life heroism
","'12 Strong' (R, 2:10), is also known as '12 Strong: The Declassified True Story of the Horse Soldiers', which tells Movie Fans much of what they need to know in deciding whether or not to see the film. Here's the rest of what you probably need to know: These 12 Army special forces soldiers (played by, among others, Chris Hemsworth, Michael Peña, the great Michael Shannon, Trevante Rhodes and the underrated Geoff Stults) become the first American troops to strike back against the Taliban in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Barely a month after the Towers came down, two Army officers (Rob Riggle and William Fichtner) choose this group of men to link up with a northern Afghan warlord (Navid Negahban) to attack the important city of Mazar-e-Sharif. / This film has a lot in common (and compares very well with) another film released in mid-January of 2016, '13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi'. Both films give us heroes to cheer for and plenty of intense action, while mining the backgrounds of the men involved - and their complex interpersonal relationships - for considerable emotional impact. '12 Strong' is thrilling, entertaining, heart-felt and serves as a great reminder of the courage and determination of the men and women who defend the homeland by fighting overseas.

Kong: Skull Island," Simply fantastic!
","Tarzan may be 'Lord of the Jungle' and Godzilla is called 'King of the Monsters', but King Kong bows to no one â€“ man or beast. He is, after all, 'The Eighth Wonder of the World', according to the original movie. American filmmaker Merian C. Cooper (who co-directed that film) named and created the character of the giant ape, with minor contributions from British writer Edgar Wallace (whom Cooper had hired to write the script, but who died early in the revisions process). The result was the iconic 1933 film â€“ followed by several other movie versions and multiple representations of Cooper's monster in various media and other forms. Over a 72 year span, three films carried the simple title 'King Kong'.That first version (starring Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot) is dated by today's standards, but featured groundbreaking special effects and music with a script written by Ruth Rose, the wife of co-director Ernest B. Schoedsack (at a time when there were a higher proportion of female screenwriters than today) and remains high on many all-time best lists. The cast of the 1976 remake (produced by famed Italian filmmaker Dino De Laurentiis and directed by the prolific John Guillermin) was led by Charles Grodin and then-20-somethings Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange (in her film debut). 2005's 'King Kong' starred Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, Jack Black & Andy Serkis and was directed by Peter Jackson. The original has higher ratings on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes than its sequels, but all made big profits.The various cinematic incarnations of the titular great ape have seen him with different personalities (sometimes as a wantonly destructive beast and others as a sympathetic anti-hero), at different sizes (portrayed between 12 feet and 60 feet tall) and with different levels of human-like characteristics (for example, walking upright in the 1933 and 1976 versions, but on all-fours for the 2005 movie). He also battled his rival for the title of biggest, baddest monster in the 1962 Japanese film (and its 1963 re-edited American version), 'Godzilla vs. King Kong', which became and remains the most-attended Godzilla film of all. Regardless of how he looks or what he is doing, the colossal primate has become such a fixture in our cultural consciousness that the 2017 version need only refer to him by a single name, joined with a reference to what outsiders call his kingdom: 'Kong: Skull Island' (PG-13, 1:58).Rather than another remake of the original 1933 version, 2017's mammoth monkey movie is a reboot. It's an origin story for the King Kong character and the second installment in Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse series which began with 2014's 'Godzilla' reboot. 'Kong: Skull Island' leads into another Godzilla movie, followed by a King Kong â€“ Godzilla crossover. A clever and game-changing post-credits scene reveals the connection and sets the stage for the coming movies. Meanwhile, this one, although based on an original story by John Gatins ('Real Steel') and a script by Dan Gilroy ('The Bourne Legacy'), Max Borenstein ('Godzilla') and Derek Connolly ('Jurassic World'), had a number of cinematic influences. According to director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, those films include 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'Princess Mononoke', 'Spirited Away' and even 'PokÃ©mon'. After seeing 'Kong: Skull Island', I'd have to add 'Jurassic Park' to that list. However, as compared to the former, the latter isÂ… a walk in the park.After that admittedly overly long introduction (which really only just scratched the surface of the background and influences to 'Kong: Skull Island'), it's finally time to talk about the movie's plot: In 1973, government official William 'Bill' Randa (John Goodman) and scientist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) convince a Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins) to support their proposed mapping expedition of a mysterious island in the South Pacific. Bill and Houston travel to Vietnam where they hire former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to lead the mission. They also secure a military escort from U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his 'Sky Devils' helicopter squadron, which includes his executive officer, Major Jack Chapman (Tony Kebbell), and a diverse and colorful group of experienced soldiers. Rounding out this large group of misfits are other government representatives (John Ortiz and Marc Evan Jackson), another young scientist (Tian Jing) and Mason Weaver (Oscar winner Brie Larson), a war photographer who is suspicious of the expedition's purpose.After flying through storm clouds which perpetually surround the island and keep it isolated from the rest of the world, the helicopters start dropping seismic charges, ostensibly as part of the mapping mission. The de facto simian ruler of this island doesn't take kindly to anyone disturbing his home. Kong (walking upright, appearing to be about 100 feet tall and played through motion capture by Terry Notary) takes out his anger on those helicopters, killing about half of the expedition's personnel in the process. The survivors, separated into small groups (and one individual) with limited communications, all set out for the other side of the island, where they are to be picked up in three days. Along the way, they encounter a variety of large, unique and deadly creatures, a tribe of island natives and an American (John C. Reilly) who has been stranded on the island for many years. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Packard, as obsessed as Captain Ahab in 'Moby Dick', is determined to avenge the loss of his men at all costs.'Kong: Skull Island' is simply fantastic! The casting, characterizations and acting are especially strong, the fight scenes and visual effects are even stronger and King Kong appears appropriately powerful, and terrifying, but also sympathetic. Rather than simply building towards one huge showdown, there are surprises and exciting moments throughout the film, but the intensity is well-balanced with some comic relief, mostly from the loopiness of Reilly's character. This film is at least as good as previous Kong movies, or 2014's 'Godzilla', and is a terrific lead-in to subsequent adventures. 'A'",9,26,53,10 March 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Don't keep it to yourself - 'The Secret Life of Pets' is great family fun!
","When you see as many movies as I do (and you start writing reviews in your head while you're watching them), certain movies, parts of movies, plot points or characters remind you of other movies. In my reviews, I often note those parallels, using them to comment on the movie I'm reviewing. Sometimes I note similarities between movies to say that the more recent film is unoriginal. Other times, it's just to help explain what the new movie is like. The animated adventure comedy 'The Secret Life of Pets' (PG, 1:30) reminds me very much of two other animated features but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Tell me if this sounds familiar: Someone's possessions (as he or she views them) actually have secret lives of their own which are only really apparent when the owner is not around. These anthropomorphic possessions relate to each other and form friendships. When a newer version of the original is brought into the group, jealousy emerges and the original tries to get rid of the interloper. This struggle results in both of the rivals being thrust out of the comforts of home into the little-understood big, bad world, a situation which requires their compadres to venture out of their own comfort zones to mount a rescue.That set-up fits Illumination Entertainment's 2016 'The Secret Life of Pets' as well as it does the 1995 Pixar/Disney classic film 'Toy Story'. (Think, 'Pet Story', or 'The Secret Life of Toys'.) But considering that the 2016 film is about animals rather than toys, maybe the better comparison is to another 2016 animated feature (also from Disney) by the name of 'Zootopia'. In both of those 2016 films, a couple of anthropomorphic animals (among many others living in a big city) form a partnership which develops into a mutually beneficial friendship. I guess it's not unfair to think of 'The Secret Life of Pets' as a mash-up of 'Toy Story' and 'Zootopia'. Nevertheless, this one charts its own unique course and is as entertaining as those other two or the 'Despicable Me' films, also from Illumination Entertainment.Now that you know what 'The Secret Life of Pets' is LIKE, here's what it's ABOUT: The movie focuses on a small brown and white terrier named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and his relationship with the other pets in his apartment building. Max lives in a small Manhattan apartment with his owner, a young woman named Katie (Ellie Kemper). When Katie goes to work each day, Max sits at the door wondering where she has gone and waiting for her to come back and play with him. Meanwhile, the pets in the building across the alley and above and below his apartment (and one guniea pig lost in the air ducts) are more active in their daily lives (and more mobile) than is readily apparent. (Thus, the title of the film.) Some of the neighborhood pets include an overweight white cat named Chloe (Lake Bell), a bulldog named Mel (Bobby Moynihan), a dachshund named Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a canary named Sweet Pea (Tara Strong), and Gidget (Jenny Slate), a white Pomeranian who has a secret crush on Max.Except for missing Katie during the day, all is well in Max's little world until one not-so-fine day when Katie brings home another dog she rescued from a shelter. Duke (Eric Stonestreet) is a large, shaggy, dark brown dog who has no problem throwing his weight around to get the best place to sleep, or as much food as he wants, or anything else. Max starts scheming about how to get rid of Duke, but one such attempt while they're in the park with Katie's dog walker back-fires and sets both Max and Duke off on a wild and dangerous journey around the city. When Gidget realizes that Max has disappeared, she enlists their mutual pet friends, plus a caged hawk named Tiberius (Albert Brooks), and a few other neighborhood pets (including the Dana Carvey voiced 'Pops'), to help her find Max. Meanwhile, Max and Duke have to try escaping from animal control workers, a disfigured alley cat named Ozone (Steve Coogan) and a small, but crazed and bitter bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who was discarded by the magician he worked for and now leads a sewer-dwelling group of radicals called The Flushed Pets, who are bent on wiping out all the humans – and who decide that Max and Duke are also their enemies.'The Secret Life of Pets' is every bit as entertaining as you'd hope, based on its theatrical trailers, or its movie posters, or just its title. Co-writers Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch exploit many of the well-known quirks of different kinds of pets, but give each character in the film its own personality. Then, once the script clearly establishes who each of these characters are, it gives them plenty to do, but without making the story unnecessarily complicated. Co-directors Chris Renaud (who also voices the aforementioned lost guinea pig) and Yarrow Cheney bring this promising concept and excellent script to realization by keeping the plot moving and not overdoing any of the film's big ideas or overplaying any of the gags. Finally, with the film's impressive voice cast and the filmmakers' 'Despicable' history, the performances and the visuals are excellent across the board. On the critical side, I found a subplot involving Duke's backstory and a 'Grease'-inspired sausage-fueled dream sequence to be odd and unnecessary diversions, and I would've liked to see just a little more originality and inspiration sprinkled throughout the movie. However, there's no denying that 'The Secret Life of Pets' is very well-done good, clean fun for the whole family. 'A-'",8,26,37,9 July 2016
Finding Dory," 'Finding Dory' fish-tails nicely with its predecessor, but has different strengths.
","Movie Fans are always searching for something when we go to the movies. I mean, that's why we go to the theater, right? We're looking to be entertained, touched, inspired, educated, and more. Filmmakers are more than happy to facilitate our search. In the past three decades or so, we Movie Fans searched for Spock, spent time searching for Bobby Fisher and for Sugar Man, and engaged in efforts aimed at finding places called Graceland and Neverland, finding people called Forrester and Mr. Right and, of course, finding a little lost clownfish named Nemo. But all that looking was easier than actually finding a sequel to the Best Animated Feature Oscar winner 'Finding Nemo'. One of that film's voice acting co-stars, Ellen DeGeneres, spent years on her talk show calling for a sequel. You wouldn't think it would be difficult to find the motivation to make a sequel to one of the highest-grossing and best-loved animated films of all time, but the original's director and co-writer, Andrew Stanton, felt he needed to find a decent story first. Eventually, he did, and now Ellen and her co-stars, along with all of us Movie Fans, get to enjoy 'Finding Dory' (PG, 1:37).It's a direct sequel to the 2003 original, but is also part prequel and part sidequel. At the beginning of this film, we get a short origin story when we meet the adorable titular regal blue tang fish, who's even more adorable as a tiny, young swimmer (voiced by Sloane Murray and Lucia Geddes). Dory is struggling to navigate life under the sea as a small fish with comical (but not overdone) short-term memory loss but she has the help of her patient and loving parents, Jenny and Charlie (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy). Sadly, Dory forgets about the dangers of the undercurrent near her home and she ends up getting swept away from mom and dad, and just lost. As an adult, Dory (Degeneres) meets a clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is desperately working at finding his lost son, Nemo (now voiced by Hayden Rolence), and the kind-hearted Dory offers to help Marlin find Nemo. (That's the sidequel part.) A year after Nemo is found and returns to life off the coast of Australia, Dory is living right next to Marlin and Nemo's anemone home and regularly accompanies Nemo to his school of fish. During one of the lessons taught by Mr. Ray (a spotted eagle ray, voiced again by Bob Peterson), Dory flashes back to a memory about her parents. She decides that she needs to find them and asks Marlin and Nemo to help her – even though it means swimming to California. Marlin is reluctant to embark on another adventure in the open ocean, but he kinda owes Dory for helping to save Nemo and all, so Marlin agrees. With the help of their old friends the sea turtles, led by Crush (again voiced by director and co-writer Andrew Stanton), and with his son, Squirt (now voiced by Bennett Dammann), Dory, Marlin and Nemo make it all the way to an educational water park at Morro Bay, California... but have no aquatic idea what to do next.As with 'Finding Nemo', in 'Finding Dory', creatures of various species show themselves to be more helpful and compassionate to each other than most members of the species homo sapiens are. After Dory gets herself scooped up by people harvesting fish off the coast, a couple of lazy sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West) lift their heads off of their favorite rock long enough to hook up Marlin and Nemo with a (literal) loon named Becky. She scoops Marlin and Nemo up in a pail and helps them get inside the Marine Life Park in hopes of finding Dory. Meanwhile, Dory has been tagged and taken to a quarantine area, where she waits with the other sea creatures to be shipped to a new large aquarium in Cleveland. Dory meets a grumpy octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill) who is set to be sent back to the ocean, but wants Dory's fin tag so he can be sent to Cleveland. (And why not? With a world-class arts scene, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, improving sports teams and terrific zoo, what's not to love?) Marlin and Nemo spend the rest of the movie overcoming obstacles to find Dory as she, with Hank's help, tries to find her parents. Dory gets additional aid from Destiny (Katilin Olson), a nearsighted whale shark who turns out to be a long-lost childhood friend, and a beluga whale named Bailey (Ty Burrell) who lacks confidence in his own echolocation abilities. Guided by additional flashes of memory, the signs within Marine Life Park and the educational loud-speaker narration of Sigourney Weaver (as herself), Dory slowly zeroes in on finding out what happened to her parents, even as all of the characters learn some lessons about determination, helpfulness and valuing each other's individual qualities.'Finding Dory' is a true sequel to its predecessor, but has different strengths. While 'Finding Nemo' was a revelation in its animation and story-telling, 'Finding Dory' keeps the action more confined and tighter. The first film has more interesting characters and more laughs, but the sequel has more heart. Of course, the sequel also benefits from the significant advances in computer animation over the previous dozen years. The backgrounds are wonderful, the textures on the sea creatures are remarkable and the colors are vibrant. I definitely recommend 'Finding Dory' (whether you saw the original or not) – and I'd also recommend that you get to the theater early enough for the adorable animated short 'Piper' (which is deserving of an Oscar nomination, along with the main attraction) and stay long enough to see the cute and funny post-credits scene. From the end of the previews until the screen finally goes dark, it's all worth it for 'Finding Dory'. 'A-'",8,2,13,18 June 2016
Arrival," 'Arrival' brings us a creative, but dull and inconsequential story.
","When a movie is such that its genre is difficult to nail down, the combination of words used to describe what kind of movie it is are significant. There is a difference between a crime drama and a crime thriller, and between an action fantasy and an adventure fantasy, and between a horror thriller and just plain horror. The difference is usually a matter of focus and emphasis. So, when you go on IMDb.com and see 'Arrival' (PG-13, 1:56) categorized as 'Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi', you can be sure that distinguishes it from, say, the 'Star Trek' films, most of which are listed as 'Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi'. 'Arrival' is one of those movies that's hard to pigeon-hole. If it helps, I'll tell you that I see this film as 20% 'Independence Day', 50% 'Contact', 10% 'It's a Wonderful Life' and about 20% other movies which I can't mention in this review without spoiling the movie's twists and reveals even if they are kind of predictable.'Arrival' centers around Dr. Louise Banks (multiple Oscar nominee Amy Adams), a brilliant linguistics professor at an unnamed university. The film opens with a montage of Louise as a single mother raising an intelligent and creative daughter who ends up tragically taken by an unnamed disease before reaching adulthood (not a spoiler, because this all happens in the film's first five minutes and is used mainly as character development). These scenes show Louise to be a doting mother, who is devastated by her daughter's premature death and has an understandably difficult time getting on with her life.When 12 huge objects which look like filled-in canoes arrive from outer space and park themselves vertically just above the surface of the earth in seemingly random and mostly remote locations all around the globe, people panic, riot and wonder. These things are just sitting there, not doing anything. The militaries which protect the countries where these objects are hovering discover that every 18 hours, a door opens at the bottom of each space ship, allowing humans to enter and attempt to communicate with the 7-legged, octopus-like beings which 'speak' in seemingly random sounds.Army Colonel Weber (Oscar winner Forest Whitaker), who is in charge of the site around a ship floating over the state of Montana, comes to the office of Dr. Banks (who had previously done some translation for the military and still holds a Top Secret clearance) to enlist her help. Louis is paired with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (multiple Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner) and, within hours, the two of them are accompanying Col. Weber and several military technicians into the Montana ship every ¾ of a day, interacting with two large septapods (as they label them) floating in a cloud behind a transparent wall.The process of communication goes frustratingly slowly. After Louis and Ian decide to remove their protective suits (so the aliens can better 'see' them), the septapods begin communicating by spraying onto the barrier an ink-like substance that forms circles with different combinations and configurations of bumps and swirls on the outside of each. Louise and Ian painstakingly figure out the meaning of these circles and how to use the heptapods' written language to find out why they came to earth. Meanwhile, U.S. military and political leaders, whose concerns are voiced by an on-site C.I.A. representative, Agent Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg), are growing impatient, while international military officers, following the lead of China's General Shang (Tzi Ma), are pushing for decisive action.'Arrival' offers up an original and very human, but rather dull sci-fi story. It's more intellectual than action-packed in nature and doesn't need battle scenes or imminent threats to the survival of mankind to make its point, but it could've used a more engaging plot. The movie ends up being not much more than a 2-hour sermon about embracing life with all of its ups and downs, which isn't enough to justify the film's long, slow build. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer (adapting Ted Chiang's multiple award-winning 1998 novella 'Story of Your Life') arrive at the moral of the story in a way that's creative and memorable (and the cast is outstanding), but the journey is too tedious.

The Big Short," 'The Big Short' does a very good job overcoming a high degree of difficulty to tell a very important story.
","Because of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009 'The U.S. entered a deep recession, with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009 U.S. housing prices fell nearly 30% on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately 50% by early 2009... The stock market recovered to its pre-crisis peak but housing prices remained near their low point and unemployment remained elevated.' That was Wikipedia, not me. When I research the historical background of a movie based on a true story, I look at multiple sources, gain a working knowledge of the topic, summarize that knowledge early in my review and use what I've learned to help me write the rest of the review and evaluate the film. Not this time. I'm no financial expert. The best I can do is pick out what seems to be the most appropriate quote that I ran across in my research and encourage other people who, like me, have very limited financial knowledge to study up a bit before seeing 'The Big Short' (R, 2:10).Much of that first paragraph talks about the results of the Great Recession, but this story is about the few who saw it coming and profited from that knowledge. The central character is Michael Burry (Christian Bale), an ex-neurologist who became a savant-like hedge fund manager. Looking where he says no one else was willing to look, he came to the conclusion that the housing boom of the early 2000s was actually a housing bubble that was getting ready to burst. He became convinced that the large amount of subprime and adjustable rate mortgages would cause a collapse in the housing market in the second quarter of 2007 and he bet that he was right. Burry used his personal investment capital, and that of his fund's investors, to buy credit swaps from the big banks. This basically amounted to an insurance policy against bundled mortgage funds which would only pay off if the market collapsed. Reasoning that the housing market was 'rock solid' and that people always pay their mortgages, financial managers were more than happy to take his money – and laugh all the way to their banks.The problem for those banks – and homeowners across the country – was that Burry was right, although only a small number of people realized it at the time. Burry had to weather severe storms of investor discontent in an effort to hold the credit swaps long enough to profit. As Burry shopped his idea around town, what he was doing became public knowledge. Most people were as perplexed and/or amused that Burry was shorting the housing market as those bankers who sold him those credit swaps, but some were intrigued enough to look into the situation for themselves. Among them was fund manager Mark Baum (played by Steve Carell and based on real-life fund manager Steve Eisman). 'Mark' set his team at FrontPoint Partners LLC (a unit of Morgan Stanley) to digging deep into the housing market – on paper and in person, so they could decide how to proceed. This puts them in business with investor Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Gosling and based on real-life investor Greg Lippmann), a man whose honesty is brought into question more than once during the movie. Two others who catch wind of Burry's scheme are talented and hungry young fund managers Jamie Shipley (based on Jamie Mai and played by Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (based on Charlie Ledley and played by John Magaro) who bring in retired banker Ben Rickert (based on Ben Hockett and played by Brad Pitt) to help them navigate these treacherous financial waters. In short, 'The Big Short' is about the people who arrived at the same conclusion about the weak U.S. housing market, what else they learned and what they did about it.This film does as well as could be expected in making its subject matter understandable and compelling and may even be said to exceed expectations. Directed and co-written by comedy writer/director Adam McKay (who only got the job after agreeing to do the second 'Anchorman' movie) and based on Michael Lewis' 2010 book, 'The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine', this film simplifies and explains things fairly well without dumbing down its subject matter or sacrificing the points it wants to make. Sometimes McKay's actors break 'the fourth wall' and talk directly to the camera, while other times celebrities like Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain show up to take us through object lessons of complex concepts. For the most part, it works. Strong acting from several previous Oscar winners and/or nominees also helps make the plot understandable and lends gravitas to the story. Handicapping the film's entertainment value, there are no heroes in this movie, which boils down to greedy people profiting from other greedy people who took advantage of unwise people. However, the film brings to a mass audience important lessons that we all need to understand on some level. 'The Big Short' gets credit for that and for very nearly overcoming its topic's very high degree of difficulty. 'B+'",7,3,6,28 December 2015
Wonder Woman," Entertaining, but too safe.
","Princess Diana of Themyscira is DC Comics' most recognizable female superhero – and actually one of the most famous and most popular overall. It's a wonder that this woman had to wait so long to have a movie of her own, especially considering how long Hollywood has been giving us superhero movies and how many of them have been made. Wonder Woman first appeared in DC Comics in 1941 and has had her own comic book series ever since. In 1975, the character finally made her flesh-and-blood debut with her eponymous TV series starring Lynda Carter as the Amazon princess who, under the name of Diana Prince, used her superpowers, her Lasso of Truth and her invisible airplane to help the U.S. Army fight the Nazis in World War II. But that series only lasted until 1979. In the years since, DC superheroes like Superman and Batman have each appeared on the big screen in multiple incarnations, with different actors playing the roles. When those two made a movie together in 2016, Wonder Woman (played by Israeli actress Gal Gadot) joined them and the following year finally gets a movie all her own. And 'Wonder Woman' (PG-13, 2:21) is only the beginning.Diana (Gadot) grows up on the isolated, uncharted island of Themyscira, the only child on the island and last child of the Greek god Zeus. Diana is fascinated by the constant close combat training of the adult Amazon women around her and wants to learn to fight too. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), doesn't want that for her daughter, but Hippolyta's sister, General Antiope (Robin Wright, from Netflix's 'House of Cards'), secretly indulges the young girl's desire. Diana grows up hearing tales of how Ares, the God of War, killed all of the other gods and, jealous of Zeus' affection for mankind, wants to use his powers to end their existence on earth. Ares' rivalry with Zeus culminates in Ares mortally wounding Zeus, who created and placed on Themyscira a weapon capable of killing Ares. As Diana matures, she becomes well-educated and, eventually with her mother's grudging approval, also becomes a skilled fighter. She instructs Antiope to train Diana harder than any Amazon has ever been trained, alluding to a secret from Diana's past, and a destiny she doesn't want to reveal to her daughter.Diana's idyllic world is shattered one day when an American fighter pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands in the waters surrounding Themyscira. Diana saves his life and protects him as the Germans pursuing him come ashore and get into a fierce battle with the Amazons. Afterwards, Diana, struggling to get over the novelty of seeing her first man, uses her Lasso of Truth to learn who Steve is and what he's doing there. She hears of the horrors of the ongoing War to End All Wars (which no one yet realizes is only the First World War) and becomes convinced that Ares must be responsible. Steve has stolen the notes of a German chemical warfare mastermind known as Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) and is determined to deliver it to his superiors in London. Diana convinces Steve that she can help him do that if he will then take her to the front where she is convinced that she can stop the war. These goals run the pair afoul of sadistic German General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis), a government official who doesn't want his armistice negotiations derailed.'Wonder Woman' serves the time-honored character, her followers and your average #MovieFan fairly well. The script comes from Allan Heinberg (a long-time television writer crossing over into film for the first time), based on a story by himself, Jason Fuchs (writer of 'Pan' & 'Ice Age: Continental Drift') and Zach Snyder (who is one of the producers of this film and is known for writing and/or directing the '300' films, 'Sucker Punch', the 2013 and 2016 Superman movies and November 2017's 'Justice League'). The plot serves as a good origin story for the title character, even enhancing her mythology and placing her in World War I (rather than WWII, like the 1970s TV series), allowing for subtext which includes women's rights (the suffrage movement) and the development of modern mechanized warfare (large-scale killing of people at a distance). The culture shock she experiences meeting men and encountering western society for the first time allows for amusing and humorous moments which feel organic. The action is intense, but the violence relatively bloodless. And the heroine's appearance is terrifically styled.Topping the list of the movie's significant strengths (and hiding its weaknesses) is the great acting, especially Godot's. The beautiful, agile and talented actress is the perfect choice to bring this character into the 21st century, giving her a complex and pleasing mix of strength, vulnerability, determination, compassion, intelligence and sex appeal. She's a warrior, a woman and, most of all, a human being. On closer inspection, however, the film's flaws emerge. The character of General Ludendorff behaves and transforms in ways that aren't only far removed from the historical record, but which don't even make sense in the context of the plot. The same holds true for some of the other characters, but the film's larger problem is in its overall plotting. The rote interpretation of superhero genre conventions keeps the movie from being as creative and exciting as it could have and should have been. Still, 'Wonder Woman' is the best DC film since the 2005-2012 Christopher Nolan / Christian Bale 'Batman' series and it's refreshingly lighter in tone than that trilogy and other cinematic incarnations of the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This movie, in spite of its imperfections, is strong and entertaining enough to warrant a recommendation – and give Movie Fans hope for the cinematic future of the Amazon princess and her DC partners in fighting for justice.

Black Panther," an examplary Marvel movie, as original as it is entertaining
","'Black Panther' (PG-13, 2:14), debuting in the second month of 2018, is the 18th feature film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is the first MCU film featuring a predominantly black cast. It's focused on the titular comic book character who was introduced briefly in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. Building on that set-up, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over for his deceased father as King of the fictional Wakanda and, with the title, inherits the abilities and responsibilities of the Black Panther.It appears that the most technologically advanced country on earth is not the U.S. or any country in Asia, but is that nation in central Africa which has been able to develop incredible technology from a rare metal which is found nowhere else on the planet (which also helps the country to remain hidden from the rest of the world, which assumes Wakanda to be just another Third World nation in Africa). In the midst of their high degree of development, the people maintain their ancient culture and traditions which, in this film, represent a rich array of real-world influences from peoples across the continent. Now that he is the king, T'Challa is responsible for safe-guarding Wakanda's unique capabilities from falling into the hands of evil doers from the outside world. (You know what they say, with great technology comes great responsibility... or something like that.) To do his job, T'Challa sometimes must become the Black Panther and use an impressive array of gadgets developed by his sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), who is best described as MCU's Tony Stark meets James Bond's 'M'. Backing up T'Challa is a formidable army led by female warriors like Okoye (Dania Gurira) and loyal officials like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), a spiritual leader called Zuri (Forest Whitaker) and T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett). T'Challa is going to need help from all of them (as well as from neighboring tribes and even a CIA officer, played by Martin Freeman) if he's going to stand against the likes of the evil Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and the lethal and power-hungry Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).'Black Panther' is unique and terrifically entertaining. It fits nicely into the MCU canon, but still charts a course all its own. Its hero is every bit as able and impressive as any other MCU character. As in the plot of most superhero movies, lives are in danger and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, but in a new and creative way. The stakes may be the same, but the tone is different - because of the film's Africa-centric setting - but also in the issues raised and the questions asked. Enhancing it all, we get exciting action, terrific visuals and awe-inspiring cinematography, not to mention a fantastic cast which includes several Oscar winners and Oscar nominees. This a Marvel movie through-and-through (complete with Stan Lee cameo and cross-pollinating end-credits scene), but it's one of the most fully-realized and enjoyable MCU cinematic achievements to date.

Mother!," Creative, artistic, insightful, awkward and messy.
","Okay, this is a tough one. When I review a film, I'm always careful to avoid spoilers. I describe a movie's characters and plot in some detail, so the reader knows what he or she is getting into if deciding to see it, but I always stop short of revealing twists or secrets which come late in the movie and I never (ever) spoil the ending. I'll stick to those rules in this review, but there is no way to write more than a sentence or two about the drama horror mystery 'Mother!' (R, 2:01) without explaining what many Movie Fans will realize at some point during the film. This thing I'm about to tell you is not clear in the trailers, but the film's star, Jennifer Lawrence, was open about the movie's theme in numerous interviews leading up to its theatrical release. Knowing what 'Mother!' is really about is pretty important in order to follow and appreciate the story. (Skip the next paragraph if you're still worried that, instead of just shedding some light on the movie, that I'm about to spoil the entire thing.)Okay, here it is: The entire film is a metaphor. If it weren't already taken, a good alternate title would be 'The History of the World, Part I'. Everything you see on the screen is a representation either of the earth (note the title) through the eons, including how humanity has interacted with the planet and each other, including how the development of religion plays into human history. I'll avoid revealing more than that regarding the film's symbolism so those who haven't seen the movie yet can discover the details for themselves, but now you know enough to understand what would otherwise be a tough film to follow. Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence plays the title character, a young woman who lives in an old, unusually-shaped house in the country with her significantly older husband, called Him (Oscar winner Javier Bardem). Mother's relationship to her house is a mystical one. It bleeds when she is upset and she detects what seems like a heartbeat in the walls. Her relationship to her husband is one of love and devotion. Him is a poet afflicted with a bad case of writer's block. Him shows emotional love to Mother, but shows little to no regard to her feelings and opinions. As Him continually tries to write, Mother works on the house, doing things like painting the walls after deciding between slightly different earth tones. The couple enjoy their quiet life of isolation until uninvited strangers begin coming to call.The stream of unexpected visitors starts with a man referred to simply as Man (multiple Oscar nominee Ed Harris). Man shows up on the doorstep and deceives his way into the home, at first saying that he thought it was an inn and then admitting that he was a fan of the writer and wanted to meet Him. The man appears respectful, but disrespects Mother's rules in a passive-aggressive manner, smoking in the house even after Mother asks him not to. Him doesn't seem bothered by any of this and quickly bonds with Man. Then, the man's wife shows up. She is simply referred to as Woman (multiple Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer). Him welcomes Woman, who quickly makes herself at home. When Woman talks to Mother, she alternates between apparent kindness and rudeness and acts like she owns the place. Him continues to take it all in stride, until Man and Woman enter Him's study and break something valuable. Mother asks them to leave, but Him begins preaching forgiveness. Before Him and Mother can reconcile their difference of opinion, two feuding sons of Man and Woman show up and a violent melee ensues.Man, Woman and their two sons finally leave the house and everything is peaceful for awhile. Him and Mother renew their marital passion and Mother becomes pregnant. Him and Mother are very happy. Then, Him's inspiration returns. He writes an apparently epic poem that brings tears to Mother's eyes when she reads it, calling it 'perfect'. The poem is published and Him gains many new fans. Starting as only a trickle, it's not long before a steady stream of Him's devotees and members of the media come to the house. They basically take over the place, growing increasingly disrespectful, destructive and hateful. Mother seems to be descending into madness, even as she is about to give birth to her baby. 'Mother!' is a dramatic example of filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's messy brilliance. The film's writer-director is known for his dream-like cinematic spectacles, ranging from the bizarrely artistic ('Pi', 'Requiem for a Dream', 'The Fountain') to the strange but accessible ('The Wrestler', 'Black Swan'). 'Mother!' falls somewhere in the middle. Aronofsky here returns to his frequent theme of religious symbolism, within a dominant environmental message and even symbolic allusions to the nature and price of fame. And his A-list actors do some of the best work of their careers, especially Lawrence (who was apparently pretty impressed with Aronofsky because she started dating him during production). It's worth noting that this movie has no score, but even more Interestingly, you might not even miss it. This film picks up speed and intensity like a roller coaster coming down from increasingly long climbs and the last 20 minutes is a whirlwind. It's almost too much to take in. And it is too much for this movie. The film's esoteric nature will render it inaccessible to many Movie Fans, while the awkward situations in the story, which eventually become chaotic and violent, will turn off others. However, there is no denying Aronofsky's creativity and skill as a filmmaker – and the impact of this thought-provoking film. 'B-'",5,1,11,15 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," 'Batman v Superman' is a little too much of a semi-good thing.
","I can't think of another movie that was preceded by more controversy and criticism than 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (PG-13, 2:31). Before I get into my plot summary (as much as I can say without spoilers) and talk about what merit there might be to the issues that have been raised, let's sum them up. There seem to be 7 of them: (1) What a stupid premise! One has super powers and the other just has gadgets. Obviously, Superman can beat Batman! What's the point? (2) Why would Batman and Superman be fighting anyway? Aren't they both good guys? (3) Why use a 'v' in the title and not 'vs.' or 'versus'? Calling it 'Batman v Superman' makes it sound like a court case! (4) DC is just copying what Marvel did with their characters coming together in the 'Avengers' movies. (5) I hope this movie is better than the last Superman movie! 'Man of Steel' wasn't that good and its ending was hard to swallow. (6) Affleck as Batman?!? Are you kidding me?? (7) Two and a half hours? This better be good.'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is very loosely based on Frank Miller's comic book series 'The Dark Knight Returns', but features an original story and takes place more in Superman's world than in Batman's. This film's Batman is not a continuation of the Christopher Nolan / Christian Bale 'Dark Knight' trilogy, but it exists in the same 'universe' as 2013's 'Man of Steel'. This is a pseudo-sequel to that film, but also functions as a 'pilot' for the ensuing 'Justice League' movies – some featuring the group of seven and some featuring the individual characters, like with the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'.Picking up with the climactic Superman / Zod showdown that took place at the end of 'Man of Steel', Bruce Wayne / Batman (Ben Affleck) is on hand to witness the devastation that befell Metropolis, including at one of his own buildings, and begins to feel that Superman / Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) is to blame for the death and destruction. For his part, Kent is growing concerned over Batman's particular brand of vigilante justice, which now includes burning the outline of a bat into the chests of criminals. As each comes to believe that the other is dangerously unaccountable, the public begins to feel that way too – but mostly towards Superman. One U.S. Senator (Holly Hunter) even holds public hearings on the matter and invites Superman himself to testify. Tech magnate Alexander 'Lex' Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is trying to get his hands on the body of Zod, Zod's crashed spaceship and some recently discovered kryptonite that could be used to keep Superman in check. (Oh, and it also might come in handy to level the playing field between Batman and Superman, if they were to ever you know, 'v' each other.) Of course, these three guys aren't playing their game of cat and mouse and supermouse in a vacuum. Kent's fellow reporter at the Daily Planet (and main squeeze), Lois Lane (Amy Adams) still needs saving from time to time, especially with villains like Islamic extremists and Russian mafia figures running through the story. Kent keeps butting heads with his boss (Laurence Fishburne) about his journalistic priorities, until he flies back to Kansas to visit his adoptive mother (Diane Lane), who gives him emotional support in his time of need – and then gets even more involved in the story. As Wayne is pursuing his growing obsession with Superman – and his growing suspicions about what Luthor is really up to, he has the assistance of his ever faithful butler, Alfred (Jeremy Irons), who seems to be doing a lot more consulting and assisting with Wayne's missions that actual butling (butlering). A mysterious woman named Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) also keeps showing up at various important moments.'Batman v Superman' deals fairly effectively with the concerns raised prior to its release. Affleck does make a very good Batman – every bit as dark and brooding as Bale's Dark Knight, but more violent. Cavill has also turned out to be a very good Superman and Adams puts just the right mix of intelligence and vulnerability into her Lois Lane. Eisenberg explores the psychotic side of Lex Luthor, which is mostly interesting, but sometimes crosses over into comically overacting. Unfortunately, just as Eisenberg's Luthor gets a little too nutty at times, so does the script. The story's Batman versus Superman rivalry and ultimate battle ends up working pretty well, but the whole set-up still ends up feeling forced. A bunch of celebrity cameos (six real-life reporters / TV personalities, one theoretical physicist and one sitting U.S. Senator) add some gravitas to the proceedings, but the plot is still a bit of a stretch.There's also just too much going on in this film. With everything that's happening in Metropolis and Gotham and Washington – and all the business about blending the worlds of multiple superheroes, 'Batman v Superman' can be a little hard to follow and, at times, seems like it doesn't amount to much more than a lot of noise and visual effects. The story worked a little better than I thought it would, the script symbolically raised some important contemporary issues and the movie was generally entertaining, but it just tried to do too much and wasn't as much fun as it could have been.

Son of Saul," 'Son of Saul' is one of the most creative and personal Holocaust films ever made.
","Sometimes life presents us with impossible choices. These are decisions we have to make even though all the options are horrible to contemplate. What do you do in a situation like that? What CAN you do? You choose the option with which you can most easily live, hoping that a better option will soon present itself. It's that kind of situation in which many European Jews found themselves during World War II. Upon arrival at a Nazi concentration camp or extermination camp, some physically fit adult males were separated from the pack and forced to help with the killing of their fellow Jews. The Nazi guards had the task of actually running the gas chambers, while the Jewish 'Sonderkommando' (German for 'special unit') gathered the belongings of the Jews who had just been forced into the gas chamber (made to look like showers). Then, when the horrible screaming and pounding on the locked doors stopped, the Sonderkommando had to transport the bodies to the crematorium. The word horrible barely begins to describe the job of the Sonderkommando – or the impossible choice they had to make. That 'choice', however, was merely one of obedience versus suicide, with disobedience being equivalent to the latter. Some Sonderkommando chose that latter option, but most fulfilled their gruesome responsibilities and hoped that they would somehow survive. That is the world of the Hungarian film 'Son of Saul' (R, 1:47).Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig) is a Hungarian Jew who works as a Sonderkommando at Auschwitz. One day as he is clearing corpses out of the gas chamber, he finds a teenage boy who is still breathing, but coughing and obviously near death. A Nazi doctor plugs the boy's nose and covers his mouth to finish the job the gas had not, as Saul watches from another room. Because the boy's initial survival is such a rare occurrence, rather than sending the boy's body to the crematorium, the doctor orders an autopsy. Saul enlists help from the doctor's assistant, who happens to be one of the prisoners, to set the body aside instead. Saul wants to give the boy a proper Jewish burial. Saul believes that this boy is his son.Saul spends the remaining twenty-four hours covered by the film making sure the boy's body remains hidden and desperately searching among his fellow prisoners for a rabbi to perform the proper funeral rites. Saul takes dangerous chances as he moves around the camp, surrounded by various stages in the murderous routine at Auschwitz, such as receiving new arrivals, operating the gas chamber and crematorium, burning bodies outside when the crematorium becomes overwhelmed and shoveling mounds of ash into a river. Further complicating Saul's quest, his fellow Sonderkommandos are plotting an uprising and they insist that he help, in spite of his conflicting priorities.With every step, 'Son of Saul' solidifies its place among the world's great Holocaust films. It's powerful like Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece 'Schindler's List', personal like Claude Lanzmann's 1985 epic 'Shoah', intimate like 1997's 'Life is Beautiful' and heartbreaking like 2008's 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas'. Co-writer and director László Nemes places his camera almost literally on the back of his lead actor, with nearly every image being a shot of Saul or a scene viewed from Saul's perspective. Nemes also uses a camera lens with a very short focal length, giving his shots a very shallow depth of field, meaning that the main character is often the only image in focus. These cinematography techniques have the effects of blurring the most graphic details of what Saul is seeing and doing, as well as drawing the viewer into the action in a way that feels like voyeurism, but is actually profoundly intimate.'Son of Saul' effectively shines a light on one of the lesser-known and more horrifying aspects of the Holocaust. Röhrig brings an appropriate understated intensity to the role of Saul, a man being forced to the do the unthinkable. He has become emotionally numb, but struggles to maintain a small shred of his humanity, even as he knows he isn't likely to have much time left. We also see the sober acceptance of fate in the eyes, words and manner of all the supporting players. Those performances, combined with the realistic look of every frame of film and the creatively intimate camera work, wake us feel that we are right there with these people every step of the way as they march toward their nearly certain doom.However, a few problems with the film slightly lessened its overall impact for me. Although it's understandable on an emotional level, it's still difficult to believe Saul would go to such great lengths to bury this boy, not just because he was risking his own life, but also considering he was increasingly endangering the lives of those around him. I also found the anticlimactic and open-ended resolution to the boy's story to be unsatisfying and frustrating (same thing with the movie's ending). As a whole, however, the film's dramatic, original and eye-opening nature helps it rise above those issues.When Sonderkommandos have been portrayed in other films, it has often been through the lens of negative judgment. In the 70+ years since World War II ended, public opinion on this issue has come to see the Sonderkommando as victims, just as much as those who went straight to the gas chambers upon their arrival in the camps. This film presents the Sonderkommandos without judgment and subtly asks the question: What would you do? By telling a little-known story from within the Holocaust and presenting that still virtually unfathomable human rights tragedy in a fresh and unusually personal way, by showing us an unimaginable dilemma, then getting us to identify with it, even with its few flaws, 'Son of Saul' has become one of the most powerful foreign films of the decade.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is a skillful blend of the old and the new which should more than satisfy most fans of the franchise.
","The opening of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (PG-13, 2:15) was a big deal. That's right. I just won the Captain Obvious Award AND the Understatement of the Year Award – at the same time! (Yay, me!) But seriously, allow me to elaborate. How many movie openings see a significant percentage of Movie Fans show up to the theater in costume? How many films make people feel that they need to buy their tickets online as much as eight weeks in advance (as the Movie Fan Facebook Page staff did)? How many cinematic experiences generate a level of anticipation bordering on a heart palpitation? A movie that does things like this is called an 'event movie', but 'Episode VII' is the event movie to beat all event movies. The desire to see the film's latest trailers (which started coming out over a year before its release) could've broken the internet. Advanced ticket sales reached a record-shattering $100 million dollars in the U.S. and also set new records in Canada, the U.K. and Germany. And that's just the tip of the Millennium Falcon. All that pre-release hype is a lot to live up to! Did the movie do it? Read on I'll get to my summary and evaluation of the movie soon, but first, here are a couple things that I will NOT do. With apologies to all who have lived in caves for the previous 40 years or so, and anyone literally born yesterday, I'm not going to spend precious time and space recounting the 'Star Wars' phenomenon or the major plot points of the previous six films. (That's what Wikipedia is for.) I also won't give as many details of the film's plot as I usually do. Since so many fans have so many questions and there's so much speculation about what (and who) is in this movie, even a moderate amount of detail would cross over into Spoiler Land, a country that I'm loathe to visit. Here's what I CAN tell you The story of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' begins about 30 years after the events of 1983's 'Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'. Luke Skywalker is the last remaining Jedi – and he's gone missing. The Galactic Empire that was destroyed at the end of the previous film in the franchise's chronology has been replaced by 'The First Order' and the erstwhile Rebel Alliance by 'The Resistance'. Both groups are desperate to find Luke. The Resistance wants him to train more Jedi in order to check the rise of The First Order. The First Order believes that the killing of the last living Jedi is essential to their goal of galactic domination. Now, before this starts sounding completely like a two and a quarter hour outer-space version of 'Where's Waldo?', here are a few other things you'll see in this movie This film brings back most of the main characters who were alive and still breathing (or, functioning – in the case of the droids) – mostly played by the original actors, while introducing a new generation of rivals, both good and evil. Daisy Ridley plays Rey, a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku. She spends her time in what looks like a junkyard filled with crashed and discarded vehicles from Episodes 4-6 and she harvests what parts she can to sell to a junk dealer to get enough food to survive. John Boyega plays a character who comes to be called Finn, a young man who's conflicted about where his loyalties lie, but who ends up joining forces with Rey on a mission – slash – adventure more dangerous and important than either of them ever imagined or even desired. Both characters also find themselves in league with Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), known as the best pilot in the galaxy. Following the template that George Lucas laid down in those original three films, J.J. Abrams, the new franchise co-writer (along with series veteran Lawrence Kasdan) and director, seems to have established these three characters roughly in the mold of strong woman Leia Organa (Rey), reluctant warrior Luke Skywalker (Finn) and cocky rogue Han Solo (Poe). At the same time, the characters on the Dark Side of the Force have their successors too.The First Order is well on its way to taking the place of The Empire and hopes to surpass the latter's dominance. The First Order is led by an enormous hologram called Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), who is helped by the loyal and ruthless general Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and an angry and conflicted black-clad warrior named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) whose background is first mysterious, and then auspicious. Oh, and these guys have a weapon that makes the Death Star look like a potato gun. Of course, the survival of the Republic is again at stake and peace-loving people throughout the galaxy have to fight to survive.In 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', Abrams creates a well-updated galaxy far, far away (from long, long ago) in which he skillfully blends the old and the new. Characters on both sides of the story's conflict fly the same ships, live on the same kinds of planets and visit similar bars (with a similarly odd menagerie of creatures) as in Episodes 4-6. The characters are well-cast and well-costumed. Abrams leaves behind the dominant use of CGI that many Movie Fans believe overtook the story-telling in Episodes 1-3 and returns to the aesthetic of the original three films. The story flows naturally from those three and nicely sets up a new set of conflicts for the final three films (with the next two due out in 2017 and 2019). The action is frequent, but varied and gives the audience brief, but satisfying bursts of excitement. This movie relies a little too much on 'Star Wars' history and the use of surprising reveals, but will more than satisfy most fans of the series. 'A-'",8,1,17,18 December 2015
Life," 'Life' is an engrossing and exciting science fiction horror thriller.
","Life on other planets. It's a possibility that has fascinated humankind since we first understood what other planets were. Movies have reflected many different thoughts on the subject. In the great 1997 sci-fi drama 'Contact', three different characters opine that if humans are the only intelligent life in the universe, that it seems like 'an awful waste of space.' In that film, Jodie Foster's character is involved with the scientific movement known as SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Life). One real-life SETI supporter, the late astronomer Carl Sagan, said that the existence of intelligent life beyond earth was a virtual certainty, considering the number of planets and stars in the universe. On the other hand, the Rare Earth Hypothesis holds that the complex set of conditions that led to the evolution of humans on earth is unlikely to be found elsewhere in the universe. Then, of course, there's the issue of whether humans would ever be able to travel the distances necessary to reach such planets (as we see addressed in 2016's 'Passengers'). Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking has been a supporter of SETI, but he has also warned us that finding life elsewhere in the universe could endanger mankind's existence on earth. That 'be careful what you wish for' attitude has given birth to countless expressions in the popular culture, from H.G. Wells' 1898 novel 'War of the Worlds' and Orson Wells' infamous 1938 radio adaptation of the same, to movies such as 1956's 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', 1979's 'Alien', 1996's 'Independence Day' and, the subject of this review, 2017's sci-fi thriller 'Life' (R, 1:43).It's about 2027 and the International Space Station is teeming with life – six astronauts and one single-celled Martian. A dramatic rescue of an errant space capsule containing soil samples from Mars is executed by engineer Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds, who had been set to star, but ended up taking a supporting role due to a scheduling conflict) and biologist Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) is very keen to see if a dormant organism from that sample can be animated. The major responsibility of Crew Captain Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) is diminishing any potential danger from this unknown organism. Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is mainly concerned with the health of the crew, which also includes Japanese astronaut Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), whose attention is divided between the mission and his wife, who is about to give birth, and Russian astronaut Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya).Hugh adjusts the temperature and atmospheric gasses in the cell's secure transparent box in order to mimic primordial earth and then, to everyone's excitement, the organism begins to move. These astronauts have just found, in Hugh's words 'the first incontrovertible proof of life beyond earth'! After a contest among elementary school students back on earth, this organism is named Calvin. The crew soon learns that Calvin's single cell functions as brain, muscle and eye. As Calvin grows, it replicates into many such cells. Soon it's big enough, smart enough and strong enough to reach up and gently touch Hugh's gloved finger, but as it continues to grow, so do its capabilities and its adaptability. Calvin's primary instinct is the same as that of every other organism in the universe – to survive. When it begins to perceive the presence of the people around it as a threat, what follows is a multi-species fight for survival – and a desperate struggle by the station's crew to keep Calvin from ever making it to earth.'Life' is an engrossing and exciting science fiction horror thriller. The film can be seen as a 21st century version of 'Alien' (and Columbia Pictures moved up its release date to avoid competing with 'Alien: Covenant'), but this movie charts its own sci-fi course. The claustrophobic environment (with almost all of the action taking place in space and with essentially only six cast members) adds to the tension and makes the action feel very intimate and real. The writing team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick ('Zombieland', 'Deadpool') give us interesting characters (brought to vivid life by six outstanding actors) and just the right balance of anticipation and action. Director Daniel Espinosa ('Safe House', 'Child 44') delivers great visuals and a taut and entertaining thriller – with one of the best endings that I've seen in a long time. This movie is definitely worth one and three quarters hours of your life – and it's so good that the time will seem to fly by – and leave you wanting more. 'A'",9,5,17,25 March 2017
Deadpool," Wild, irreverently funny and unique. Don't miss 'Deadpool'!
","Sometimes a movie's very first scene perfectly sets the tone – and serves notice that you're about to have a unique cinematic experience. Allow me to illustrate by describing the opening sequence to the big-screen adaptation of Marvel Comics' 'Deadpool' (R, 1:48). We see a single moment frozen in time – the inside of an SUV as it flips over on a busy highway. In slow motion, the camera travels through the vehicle documenting the precarious (and humorous) positions of various bad guys who have gone airborne because of the crash. As we journey through this increasingly bizarre montage, the only sound we hear is Juice Newton's 1981 hit song 'Angel of the Morning'. We also see the movie's opening credits – not names, but tongue-in-cheek references to the actors and filmmakers, employing phrases like 'The British Villain', 'The Comic Relief' and 'Overpaid Hack'. Wild. Irreverently funny. Unique.Before he was the violent, wise-cracking anti-superhero Deadpool, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) was just a violent, wise-cracking neighborhood tough guy for hire. (He's the kind of person you'd go to if you wanted to intimidate someone else into doing something for you – or just leave you alone.) Wade seems to have only one friend, a bartender called Weasel (T.J. Miller) until Wade meets hooker/waitress Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). They each have an acerbic wit, an irreverent personality and a messy life. In other words, they're perfect together. They fall in love, start living together and even discuss marriage. It seems like they're each as happy as they've ever been before until the other shoe drops. Wade suddenly falls ill and is diagnosed with cancer, which has taken hold in different parts of his body.A mysterious 'recruiter' meets Wade at Weasel's bar and tells Wade that he can cure that cancer – and make him better than he was before. With no other options, Wade enters a secretive and ominous-looking facility where he is subjected to torturous pseudo-medical treatments designed to force his body to mutate. Wade emerges cancer-free, and with impressive strength and athletic abilities, as well as the ability to rapidly self-heal, but also with a face which Weasel says looks like 'a topographical map of Utah' among other things. To hide his disfigurement, Wade makes himself a red and black suit and mask and adopts the name Deadpool, after the dead pool that Weasel runs for the patrons at his bar.Deadpool may look and move like a superhero, but the man behind the mask rejects that label. He's an anti-hero on a mission. Deadpool is out to find Ajax (Ed Skrein), the man who, along with his assistant, Angel Dust (Gina Carano), ruined Wade's good looks – and force Ajax to fix what he messed up. With a decidedly anti-superhero attitude, Deadpool (gruesomely) kills anyone who comes after him and tries to stop him. Two other mutants (a large metallic man and a teenager who can release powerful bursts of energy from her body) try to get Deadpool to join them and their fellow X-Men. No dice. Deadpool is a solo act – only interested in getting his complexion fixed so he can reunite with Vanessa and (besides Weasel) only associating with his old lady roommate, Blind Al (Leslie Uggams).'Deadpool' is not your father's superhero movie (or your son's, for that matter). As much as we all enjoy a good superhero flick, the whole R-rated anti-hero/superhero thing is a refreshing change of pace. The script (by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) is witty, hilariously self-referential, and the conceit of Deadpool breaking the fourth wall works surprisingly well. Under the guidance of visual effects guy – turned director (FIRST TIME feature director - !) Tim Miller, we get some great action sequences and visuals (despite the production's incredible shrinking budget), a story that's fairly simple and easy to follow (despite its non-linear presentation) and a main character that's faithful to the source material.Although you may have your doubts just reading through the list of actors in this film, it's actually perfectly cast. Skrein and Carano make a great villain and henchman (henchwoman), respectively, Miller is a terrific weasley friend, it's wonderful to see Uggams back on screen (especially since I kinda thought she had died) and Brianna Hildebrand (as Negasonic Teenage Warhead) as well as Stefan Kapičić / Andre Tricoteux / Greg LaSalle (who, respectively, provided the voice, body motion-capture performance and facial motion-capture performance for Colossus) brought a lot to their mutant roles and left me wanting more. Maybe most surprising of all, Baccarin made me forget her many famous well-dressed small-screen characters, like the stressed-out former POW's wife in 'Homeland' and the devious otherworldly leader, Anna, in 'V'. Then, of course, there's our star. Reynolds plays his character like a combination of Bill Murray (in 'Ghostbusters' or 'Groundhog Day'), Daniel Craig (in 'Casino Royale') and Bruce Willis (not as the incredulous superhero in 'Unbreakable', but more like his heroic but mortal somewhat heroic anti-heroes in 'Die Hard' and 'Hudson Hawk'). That all may sound like kind of a mess, but the sensibilities of those characters joined with Reynold's natural charm make for a winning combination.But don't just take my word for it. Let the data be your guide. This film started breaking box office records (albeit very specific and obscure records) as early as its Thursday night previews and Friday opening day. Still not convinced? Here's an idea – see the movie! Even if you don't like it, at least you'll know what everyone else is talking about. You'll also be ready if you get dragged to the sequel, which Reynolds/Deadpool announces in a post-credits scene. Of course, no one can guarantee you'll like 'Deadpool'. After all, it's 'only' a superhero flick and it isn't exactly Oscar material, but I, for one, can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a movie. And, after all, isn't that the point?

John Wick: Chapter 2," 'John Wick: Chapter 2' is an enjoyable, stylish and action-packed thrill ride.
","In Hawaiian, the native language of Keanu Reeves' biological father, his first name means 'cool breeze over the mountains'. Sounds peaceful, right? Well, early in his career, Reeves played pretty peaceful characters in 1988's 'Dangerous Liaisons', 1989's 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure' and, in 1991, 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey', 'Parenthood' and as an FBI agent pretending to be a surfer in 'Point Break'. That last role also marked the beginning of Reeves' transition to more intense and even tormented characters, like in 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' (1992), 'Speed' (1994) and 'The Devil's Advocate' (1997). Although the man with the peaceful-sounding first name still sprinkled in some sweet and peaceful roles (e.g., 'Sweet November', 'A Walk in the Clouds', 'The Lake House' and a voice-over as a kitten named after him in 2016's 'Keanu'), most of the parts Reeves played in the late 1990s and early 2000s have been decidedly un-peaceful – in movies like 'Johnny Mnemonic', 'The Matrix' (and its two sequels), 'Constantine', 'Street Kings', 'Man of Tai Chi' (which he also directed), '47 Ronin' – plus 'John Wick' and its sequel 'John Wick: Chapter 2' (R, 2:02). Peaceful? Not hardly! Entertaining? You betcha! 'Chapter 2' is a very appropriate phrase to include in this movie's title, for a couple of reasons. The action picks up right after the events of 2014's 'John Wick'. Having come out of hit-man retirement to avenge the murder of his puppy and defend his own life by dispatching scores of bad guys, he now comes for his stolen car, knocking off a few more thugs in the process, and then calls it even with the boss (Peter Stormare) of what's left of the crime family which John has decimated. He calls a mechanic friend (John Leguizamo) to repair what's left of his souped-up Mustang, reburies his weaponry in the floor of his house (under concrete which he lays down himself), looks wistfully at a picture of his late wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), takes care of his new dog (which he has not yet named) and, to quote the 1980's singer known as Rockwell, John might say, 'All I want is to be left alone in my average home, but I always feel like someone's watching me.' He has good reasons for thinking and feeling all of that.Since Wick (aka 'The Boogeyman') came out of retirement (albeit for very good and personal reasons), the international organization of assassins of which he was a part now considers him un-retired. (After all, John himself said in the previous film, 'People keep asking if I'm back. Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.') Italian assassin Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), a member of one of the families represented at 'The High Table' of assassins shows up to hand his old friend an amulet with John's bloody thumb print inside, a token of what Santino says is a blood oath which was reinstated when John came out of retirement. John is now obligated to fulfill a 'request' by Santino or he himself will be killed.Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of New York's Continental Hotel (a kind of safe house and DMZ for international assassins), reaffirms to John that those are the rules and there is no other way, so John heads to Rome to do his job. John proceeds with his trademark classiness as he plans to execute his responsibility. Of course, nothing will be easy, even for John Wick, and he'll eventually have to defend himself against a number of deadly agents, including one played by Common, and another by Ruby Rose, but he also gets help from 'The Sommelier' (Peter Sarafinowicz), who deals in a lot more than wine, Charon (Lance Reddick), the classy and extraordinarily helpful concierge at The Continental Hotel – and a blast from Keanu Reeves' own cinematic past (a cool cameo which I don't want to spoil).'John Wick: Chapter 2' is an enjoyable, stylish and action-packed thrill ride. As good as the original film was, this one keeps what worked so well the first time, takes the plot deeper into the main character's world and adds several interesting new characters. It's an intense action shoot-'em-up, but it's not just the guys who get to have all the fun. (Beware of mute female henchmen, lady violinists on the subway and women who would rather slit their own wrists than become a hit-man's victim.) Besides its many colorful characters, this sequel keeps audiences engaged with its general air of sophistication, its stylized action sequences and visually sumptuous set pieces that are to die for. If you don't mind a high body count and a few vagaries in its plot points, this is everything an action sequel should be – including setting the stage very well for 'Chapter 3'. For now, I'll close this 'John Wick' chapter with an 'A-'.",8,12,24,11 February 2017
Annihilation," engaging, scary, creative and thought-provoking
","'Annihilation' (R, 1:55) sounds like it should be a sci-fi - horror - action movie. As the musical prophet (Meat Loaf) has taught us: two out of three ain't bad. This movie is firmly in the sci-fi / horror camp. There is some action, but the focus is more on the characters - a female cast, atypical for the genre.Oscar winner Natalie Portman stars as Lena, a medical school biology instructor and former U.S. Army soldier, whose active-duty special forces husband (Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac) goes missing on a top-top secret mission - for a whole year. When Kane suddenly shows up in the hallway outside his old bedroom, he's... not himself. After an emotional embrace, Lena demands answers from the practically catatonic Kane, but he doesn't have many. Then, he experiences a severe medical episode which lands him - and Lena - in a top-top-top secret government facility just outside a gradually expanding land and shoreline area called 'The Shimmer', hidden behind a colorful curtain of light through which drones, animals and people have been sent, never to be seen or heard from again, well, except for Kane, that is.Rather than sitting on her hands while Kane may be dying in that building, Lena talks the facility's psychologist (Oscar nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh), into letting her come on the expedition she's about to lead into the Shimmer, along with three fellow scientists, played by Gina Rodriguez, Josie Radek and Tuva Novotny. Since the male military teams haven't been able to survive the Shimmer, maybe, just maybe, female scientists (or, simply, scientists, as one of them points out to Lena) will be able to have more success. They each have their own reasons for volunteering for what may well turn out to be a suicide mission, and they each have their own struggles surviving an environment in which strange, new plants and animals exist - and rapidly... mutate - as do the bodies and minds of those in this expedition. With 'Annihilation', 'Ex Machina' writer/director Alex Garland adapts the novel of the same name (the first in the 'Southern Reach' trilogy) by Jeff VanderMeer and helms the film as well. As in Garland's previous work, the character development is excellent, the acting is great and the optics (the visual effects and the creatures) are stunning. This film is engaging, scary, creative and thought-provoking - Alex Garland at his finest. Framing the story in the context of a post-expedition interview does little to enhance the story and it actually reveals more of the story (told in flashbacks) than necessary - and the pace of much of the film is a bit slow - but 'Annihilation' is solid, inventive and entertaining enough to make up for those minor flaws.

Inside Llewyn Davis," 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a joyless meditation on some very meaningful music.
","1960s folk music had a message and often expressed hope and sometimes even joy. It's too bad that 'Inside Llewyn Davis' (R, 1:45), a movie about a fictional folk singer in the early 60s doesn't seem to understand that.Oscar Isaac plays the title character, a singer with talent who can't quite catch a break. Even when he seems on the verge of something good happening to him, it either doesn't pan out or he blows it up. He keeps on trying to succeed, in spite of it all, but as an audience member, I was hard pressed to root for him. You see, Llewyn is completely self-absorbed and joyless. He floats from couch to couch in New York City, staying with friends until he wears out his welcome and has to move on to the next temporary bed, but rarely expresses gratitude. He even manages to alienate some of the few friends he has. He's also constantly trying to borrow money, insulting friends and family in the process.You'd think that, as hard as he works and as much as he sacrifices for his art that he would have a passion for it, but none is apparent. He never seems to get any pleasure from performing his own music and even gets angry when he is asked to sing a song for friends. The only true friend he has is a cat that keeps popping up in the film, but Llewyn is ambivalent towards the animal, especially when it needs him the most. Things start looking up for Llewyn when he comes into a little cash, which he uses to pay for his share of the gas in a car pool going to Chicago, where he hopes to get a job, but the film doesn't offer a resolution to that part of the story. There doesn't seem to be resolution to much of anything in Llewyn's life, or in this movie.'Inside Llewyn Davis' features some good covers of original 60s folk music and a bit of new music but that's about the only nice thing I can say about this movie. Oscar Isaac's performance is uninspired (although he does sing several of the songs in the soundtrack) and some great actors (including Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman and F. Murray Abraham) are wasted in this film. They're given little to do and don't seem to want to be there. How can a celebration of 60s folk music be so short on celebration? Joel and Ethan Coen, who, as with most of their movies, share writing and directing credits, made their similarly-themed 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?' somewhat entertaining, but seem to have had all their fun with that one. There sure isn't any on display in this depressing exercise. It seems to me that almost as bad as actually being Inside Llewyn Davis is being inside a theater showing 'Inside Llewyn Davis'.To be fair, I should point out that some other moviegoers seemed to enjoy this movie very much, although I'm at a loss to understand why. Somehow, this film snagged Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical and Best Performance by an Actor – Comedy or Musical. I didn't realize that 2013 was such a slow movie year. The film also received a nomination for Best Original Song, but I agree with that one. The scene showing the recording of the whimsical ditty 'Please Mr. Kennedy' and some of the other music is what's keeping me from giving this flick an 'F'. The most I can give this cinematic dud is a 'D'.",1,4,10,23 December 2015
Spectre," 'Spectre' is an entertaining enough action/spy film, but disappointing as a Bond film.
","Let's take a moment to talk about the octopus, whose image and symbolism figure prominently in 2015's cinematic James Bond incarnation, 'Spectre' (PG-13, 2:28). The creature's eight tentacles have often been used as symbolic of people or organizations with a wide and varied reach, but that's only the most obvious example of octopus as metaphor. As a cephalopod mollusc, the octopus lacks a fixed skeletal structure, which enables it to more easily hide from its enemies. It can also defend itself by emitting an ink cloud, which functions as a smoke screen to enable its escape, and also uses its explosive speed to great advantage. If necessary, it can even shed tentacles and still survive. The octopus has three hearts, as opposed to the single heart in us fragile humans. The creature's nervous system is similarly decentralized, meaning that its brain doesn't control all of its movements. Octopus tentacles sense and react separately from each other, yet to the singular benefit of the whole organization, er, I mean, organism. The tentacles and their suction cups can reach relatively far and wide for food, yet the nourishment all finds its way to the appropriate spot in the octopus' one and only head. Many facts about the octopus make it a compelling symbol for the villainous international entity called Spectre.Before images of octopus tentacles float throughout the film's title sequence, the sea creature's evocative image has already made its appearance in the midst of the action on screen. James Bond (Daniel Craig, in his fourth and reportedly final outing as 007) is in Mexico City for the Day of the Dead festival. He's there to use his License to Kill against a highly-placed international criminal figure. After nearly having a building fall on top of him and almost being thrown from a helicopter flying erratically over a crowded public square, Bond returns to London, claiming that he had been in Mexico 'on holiday'. Bond's current supervisor, the new M (Ralph Fiennes), restricts him to London, but with help from M's assistant, Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), and the technical and computer whiz called Q (Ben Whishaw), that doesn't last very long. Bond was in Mexico on a mission, which led to revelations that turn out to be dangerous to people all around the world as well as very personal to Bond himself.With information from an assassin's widow (Monica Bellucci), whom he meets in Rome, Bond soon finds himself in direct confrontation with the international crime organization known as Spectre. This is a group of people who are involved in everything from human trafficking to covert surveillance, all to build both wealth and power. Spectre's leader (Christoph Waltz) takes a very intense interest in 007, for both professional and personal reasons, and this guy manages to get inside Bond's head very effectively! Before he can even try to take down the criminal mastermind, James has to keep out of the clutches of Spectre's murderous thug, Mr. Hinx (Dave Bautista), confront an old adversary, and try to protect this film's main 'Bond girl', Dr. Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), who, of course, is the only person who can help him find and defeat Spectre. Meanwhile, in the midst of all of this action and intrigue, M is back in London trying to reign Bond in and fight the efforts of a British government official known as C (Andrew Scott) who believes that the double-O program (as in, '007') is outdated and needs to be terminated.'Spectre' is, in its own right, an entertaining globe-trotting action-adventure, but suffers by comparison to the other recent Bond films. It starts out thrillingly enough, causing me to hold my nacho in mid-air above my cheese dip until the movie's first few breathless moments had passed. And for a while after that beautifully stylistic title sequence, the plot looks promising. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, the movie becomes much like the brand new Astin Martin that Bond dumps in the Tiber River - soggy and not worth as much as its earlier versions. Craig looks as tired as some audience members by the end of the film's 2 ½ hour running time. Seydoux reminds one a little of a young Annette Bening and she looks great in a silky evening gown, but her character lacks the intelligence and sultriness to be a proper Bond girl. The villains aren't especially compelling either. Waltz was more menacing at some moments in 'Big Eyes'. Bond dispatches one bad guy after the doomed thug makes a very corny utterance in the midst of a scene that feels stolen from 'Air Force One' and then 007 fails to put another threat to innocent people everywhere out of his existential misery when all common sense seems to demand it.Several moments in this movie are either non-sensical, corny or derivative. For example: Why would South Africa be the one holdout in an international intelligence consortium that, for some unexplained reason, can't move forward without them? The movie does a great job of honoring past Bond films and tying together all four of Craig's 007 excursions, but overdoes it just a bit. The major conflicts, with Bond pursuing a secretive criminal organization while others are fighting the proposed elimination of his job, feels a bit too much like the plot of 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation' earlier in 2015. Not to accuse either movie of copying the other, but having seen this basic story just a few months earlier does rob the 24th (official) Bond film of some of its impact. Having said all that, what these criticisms mainly reflect is my general disappointment in 'Spectre', compared to the last three Bond films which raised the bar for the venerable franchise. The movie is above-average as an actioner and a spy flick, and is a good Bond film, but just not great. I recommend it, but just barely: 'B-'",5,6,16,6 November 2015
Joy," 'Joy' is definitely a David O. Russell film, but a more accessible and uplifting one.
","Believing in yourself can be one of the most difficult things to do. When the people closest to you, the circumstances of your own life and even the past mistakes and present doubts which we all have, seem stacked against you, it's tough to push forward to reach your goals. Even when you do believe in yourself and remain determined to reach those goals, sometimes things just don't work out. We rarely hear the stories of those who try their hardest and always fall short, but when we hear a story of someone who overcomes the odds and fulfills his or her potential, it encourages us dreamers. Such a story gives us hope. Such a story gives us 'Joy' (PG-13, 2:04) As a child, Joy did great in school and always liked to make things. She seemed destined for something big, but, adult Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) is being held back by something seemingly inescapable – everyday life. She's the kind of person who takes care of daily tasks, family members and basically whoever and whatever needs taking care of. Joy has bills and a mortgage to pay, so she works as a put-upon airline reservation agent. At home, she's a put-upon daughter, mother and ex-wife. Living with her are her two small children, 5-year-old Christie (played by twins Aundrea and Gia Gadsby) and 3-year-old Tommy (twins Tomas and Zeke Elizondo), Joy's mother, Terry (Virginia Madsen), who does nothing but sit on her bed and watch soap operas on TV, Joy's gruff and stubborn father, Rudy (Robert DeNiro), Joy's grandmother, Mimi (Diane Ladd), and Joy's ex-husband, Tony (Edgar Ramirez), whom she allows to live in her basement. Joy's half-sister, Peggy (Elisabeth Röhm) is the only close family member who doesn't live in the house, which is good, considering the tense rivalry between the two women. This is Joy's life.After one particularly stressful day, Joy literally dreamed up an invention which she became convinced she could market, in spite of her lack of business experience. Joy used her daughter's crayons to draw what became 'The Miracle Mop', a self-cleaning mop, which would never have to be replaced. She has her father set up a pitch meeting for her with Rudy's new girlfriend, Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), the eccentric widow of a successful businessman. With Trudy's initial investment, Joy sets up production in Rudy's auto repair shop. After some frustrating experiences trying to find ways to market her invention, a QVC executive (Bradley Cooper) agrees to put her product on TV. After a couple more fits and starts, the product is a success, but Joy's struggles are ongoing. To ensure her long-term success, Joy has to overcome obstacles caused by her lack of capital, some dismissive potential partners, plus difficult and unscrupulous business associates, not to mention jealous, greedy, negative and unsupportive family members. Absolutely nothing comes easy for Joy, but she's determined to make something of herself.'Joy' is a typical David O. Russell film – with a few notable exceptions. He has cast Lawrence, Cooper and DeNiro (all doing their usual outstanding work) in his third film in a four year span (after 2012's 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 2013's 'American Hustle'). Russell's script and direction display his signature quirky characters, although he has dialed back the eccentricity. This film is as enjoyable as 'Hustle' and definitely more family-friendly than 'Hustle' or 'Playbook', as Russell makes 'Joy' only his second film to earn a 'PG-13' from the MPAA. This film is also more uplifting and focused than those other two. As with 'Hustle', Russell takes liberties with real-life scenarios, bending a true story to his will. What he gives us is a dramatic, funny and inspiring tale that goes beyond the challenges overcome by one specific person or gender. It's unfortunate that the producers saw fit to take even more liberties in their marketing of the film. The movie's trailers seemed to consciously avoid letting movie audiences know that this is a film mainly about the invention and marketing of a mop. Then, the combination of the title, the movie poster's images and the Christmas Day release date seem intended to make the film look like a Christmas movie. Maybe it's just me, but I find deceptive marketing practices offensive and feel that they tarnish the reputation of what is otherwise an excellent movie. Although this film lacks some of the spark and energy that Movie Fans are accustomed to seeing from David O. Russell, 'Joy' is an accessible, entertaining and hopeful film.

The Nice Guys," 'The Nice Guys' is more than just a 'nice' way to spend a couple hours.
","I'm really excited about this one! Sometimes I'm concerned that the movies I reference in my reviews may be too old or too obscure to really help the reader understand the point I'm making, but never before have I come across a group of movies that represent the movie I'm reviewing so remarkably well, or that are so surprisingly well connected to each other! Let's look back at the fall of 1997. Just three weeks apart, two great movies came out which would both go on to receive multiple Oscar nominations and were both set in Los Angeles in the mid-to-late 20th century. 'Boogie Nights' dramatized the porn industry in the San Fernando Valley from 1977 to 1984, as shown in the rise and fall (pun intended) of young porn actor Eddie Adams, a.k.a. 'Dirk Diggler' (played by a rising star named Mark Wahlberg). This movie is notable for its excellent screenplay, terrific acting from a fantastic cast (which included Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy and then relative unknowns like Luis GuzmÃ¡n, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Don Cheadle) â€“ and for the film's realistic portrayal of late 70s' and early 80s' L.A. 'L.A. Confidential' had come out three weeks earlier and painted an equally vivid and nuanced picture of the City of Angels in 1953, complete with government corruption which involved a character played by Kim Basinger. Fast forward to 2014. The Oscar-nominated 'Inherent Vice' tells the story of a private eye (Joaquin Phoenix) who is investigating a case involving multiple missing persons in 1970 L.A. That movie was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who had also written and directed 'Boogie Nights'. The darkly comedic 2016 film 'The Nice Guys' (R, 1:56) has a private eye looking for multiple missing persons, while uncovering connections to the porn industry AND government corruption in 1970s Los Angeles AND a character played by Kim Basinger is an important part of the plot. Boom! So, are those some really cool connections, or is it just me? Oh. Just me. Alrighty then. I'll just review the movieÂ… The title characters in 'The Nice Guys' areÂ… kind of nice, relatively speakingÂ… when you understand that they do some not-so-nice jobs. Jackson Healy (Oscar winner Russell Crowe) is muscle for hire. He beats people up (or worse) for money, but he's relatively polite when he does it and he feels kind of bad about it. (Well, he feels that he's cut out for more than, say, roughing up a guy whose messing around with a client's teenage daughter, and he wishes that he were doing something different.) Holland March (past Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling) is a private eye who seems to make most of his money half-heartedly investigating far-fetched missing persons claims by little old ladies. He's very polite in dealing with his clients and he's sorta smart, but he's not as tough or skilled as he acts, and he has a real problem with pain and with the sight of blood â€“ especially his own. Regardless, Holland makes a good living and takes good care (financially, if not emotionally) of his teenage daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice). Holly is smarter, tougher... and nicer than Holland, whom she reluctantly 'parents' better than he parents her.Holland is simultaneously investigating an alleged sighting of a porn star named Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) â€“ two days after she was supposedly killed in a car accident â€“ while also looking for an even younger woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who is a protest organizer, who may have appeared in 'an experimental film' with Misty Mountains, and who definitely does NOT want to be found. Jackson, on the other hand, has been hired by Amelia to get this PI named Holland March off her trail. This situation leads to an inauspicious first meeting between Jackson and Holland, followed by an auspicious second meeting when they decide to join forces and use their respective talents to find out what's actually going on. You see, Holland has recently received an unwelcomed visit from a couple of thugs (Beau Knapp and Keith David) who demand to know where Amelia is, and then people who are connected to Amelia and/or Missy start dropping dead at an unnatural rate. Our titular 'nice guys' eventually meet a Justice Department employee (Kim Basinger, an Oscar winner for 'L.A. Confidential') who hires the pair to find Amelia, just as they discover that a Mafioso (Matt Bomer) from New York is in L.A. looking for them â€“ and he ain't interested in talking. With Holly forcing her way into the equation to help her dad and his new partner, it's a race against time to find Amelia and figure out who's killing her acquaintances (and why) before those really not-so-nice guys catch up with the two relatively nice guys.'The Nice Guys' is a quirky, darkly comedic and intriguing whodunit. The script, by Shane Black (who also wrote 'Iron Man 3', 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', 'The Long Kiss Goodnight', 'The Last Boy Scout' and the original 'Lethal Weapon') and newcomer Anthony Bagarozzi, is intricate, but not hard to follow, and contains smart and very funny dialog and situations (including great tie-ins to TV's 'The Waltons' and President Richard Nixon), plus a mystery that's engaging but suffers from an awkward final resolution which feels forced. Besides co-writing, Black (who also directed 'Iron Man 3') directs this film with a good feel for pace, tension and comic timing, while his very talented cast (especially Gosling, Crowe and Rice) really brings it all together. While similar in content to those other three films mentioned earlier, this one is closest in tone and style to 'Inherent Vice', but is more accessible and less flawed. 'The Nice Guys' is more than just a 'nice' way to spend a couple hours â€“ it's a pretty damn entertaining one. 'A-'",8,10,21,21 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Truth in advertising - 'Hacksaw Ridge' IS one of the best war films since 'Saving Private Ryan'.
","Have you ever been misunderstood? Maybe you just failed to communicate your thoughts effectively. Maybe you said or did something that cast doubt on your true intentions. Or maybe others just ascribed to you negative motives of people they've known in the past – and failed to judge you based on your own actions. We've all been there, but few of us have had to risk as much for our convictions as World War II Army medic Desmond T. Doss. You see, as a Seventh-day Adventist, Doss took the Bible literally. To him, the sixth commandment means God forbids killing anyone – ever – for any reason – even in war. He volunteered to be a medic in the war, but even in basic training, he steadfastly refused to even touch a gun. The law calls someone like Doss a conscientious objector. His fellow soldiers just called him a coward. That is until they went into battle with him. Desmond's struggle to live out his principles, in spite of what others thought, and through the horrors of war, is the story of 'Hacksaw Ridge' (R, 2:11).As a child, Desmond (Darcy Bryce) developed a strong religious faith – and a strong aversion to violence. He and his brother physically fought each other often. One of those times, Desmond hit his brother with a brick, nearly killing him. Desmond's father, Tom (Hugo Weaving) used to beat his boys, and sometimes got physical with their mother, Bertha (Rachel Griffiths). Tom himself was a shell of a man who never shook memories of the violence he saw as a soldier in World War I, constantly visiting the graves of his friends who died in that war. All of this had a profound effect on Desmond in his formative years.The adult Desmond (Golden Globe nominee Andrew Garfield) not only wants to avoid doing what he believes God prohibits, but he wants to do good things to help others. After saving the life of an accident victim by applying a tourniquet – and meeting a pretty local nurse named Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) – he develops a strong desire to study medicine. Even as he courts Dorothy, he feels drawn to do his part in the war – as an Army medic. As he says when defending his belief in non-violence, 'With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it don't seem like such a bad thing to me to put a little bit of it back together.' Desmond may avoid violence, but violence sure finds him – and sooner than he expected. His drill instructor, Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn), and his company commander, Cpt. Glover (Sam Worthington), greet Desmond's convictions with frustration. His fellow trainees, especially people like Smitty Ryker (Luke Bracey), express their feelings towards him by attacking him in the barracks. When Cpt. Glover's boss, Col. Stelzer (Richard Roxburgh) gives Desmond a direct order to pick up a weapon and he refuses, the young recruit finds himself facing the possibility of an Army court martial – and maybe prison time.Eventually, Cpl. Desmond Doss and his company find themselves arriving on the Japanese island of Okinawa in the closing months of the war. Now less than 400 miles from mainland Japan, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps experienced some of the fiercest fighting of the war – with some of the highest casualty rates. Doss' company is tasked with driving the Japanese soldiers off of Hacksaw Ridge – an area of land 400 feet above the beach. To accomplish their mission, the troops had to climb up a rocky cliff face using only a rope ladder – and then face well-entrenched Japanese forces which had vowed to fight to the death. Doss and his company charge straight toward danger. Not everyone would survive, but those who did, were Doss' responsibility – a mission for which he repeatedly put his life on the line.I often find reviewers' comments in a movie's advertising to be overblown but not in this case. 'Hacksaw Ridge' IS one of the best war films since 'Saving Private Ryan'. The battle scenes in this film are even more graphic and intense than the scenes of D-Day in 'Ryan', and features the most realistic Pacific Theater action since 2006's 'Flags of Our Fathers'. But like those other two, this film is more a story about the men who fought the war than the battles themselves. This is a bio-pic, so there's plenty of character development. It's a story about principles and courage, so there's plenty of struggle and heroism. And, as I said in my first paragraph, this is a story about misperceptions and, in the end, understanding and mutual respect, which contains lessons for all of us. This is a touching human story and an unflinching look at the horrors of war and the value of different kinds of heroism. 'A'",9,8,15,4 November 2016
Macbeth," 'Macbeth' is an excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's classic play about madness for power.
","I love Shakespeare! I really do! I don't understand all of it, but I love it! The Bard's timeless themes and insights into human nature still ring true 500 years after his death. His sense of tragedy, drama and humor still entertain. Then there's the language, as beautiful as it is challenging to most modern ears. Many stage, screen and film Shakespeare adaptations have tried to make his plays more accessible by translating them to a more up-to-date way of speaking and some of those adaptations have been excellent, but there's no substitute for the real thing. It helps if you know enough history and literature to understand what you're hearing, but even if you can only catch a line here and there, if you're watching great actors and they're working for a great director, you should be able to follow and enjoy most productions of Shakespeare. A very good example of this is 2015's 'Macbeth' (R, 1:53).Wait a minute. I doubt this is the situation of anyone out there, but just in case, if you happen to be reading this review aloud inside a theater, please stop now, go outside, turn around three times and wait for someone to invite you back in. And for the rest of this review, every time you come upon the name of the play, just be sure to refer to it as 'The Scottish Play'. Got it? Good. Onward and upward.The play 'Macbeth' was probably written around the middle of Shakespeare's career as a playwright. It's the shortest of his tragedies, perhaps indicating that the version we have today is an abridged version of the original. Possibility due to its brevity, but probably owing more to its compelling story, the Scottish play has been one of the Bard's most popular. Struggling theaters have often turned to it as insurance against financial ruin (even though some of them went under anyway, possibly fueling the superstition to which I eluded in my previous paragraph). The play's action (with more fights and combat than most of Shakespeare's plays) and its popular themes of the desire for power and the price we pay for our decisions have entertained audiences for five centuries and spawned nearly 100 films.In the 2015 film version, previous Oscar nominee and future Oscar winner Daniel Fassbender (yeah, I just predicted something there) plays the titular anti-hero, and Oscar winner Marion Cotillard plays the scheming Lady Macbeth. Macbeth is a general in the army of the Scottish King Duncan I (David Thewlis) who is in the midst of fighting a civil war. After winning a major battle for his king, three mysterious women (witches) approach Macbeth on the battlefield and prophesy that he will get a promotion (which he finds out about right after this encounter) – and that he will be king! When Macbeth returns home and tells his wife about the prophecy and that Duncan will be their guest for one night, she encourages Macbeth to kill Duncan and claim the crown. Macbeth is conflicted, but ultimately agrees.Macbeth steals into Duncan's tent and brutally stabs him, then Lady Macbeth disposes of the two daggers her husband used in the murder, framing the king's (drugged) guards. Duncan's son, Malcolm (Jack Reynor), discovers his father's body and flees in fear. This makes him look guilty of something, so after Macbeth kills the king's sleeping guards in a fit of mock rage, he is crowned King of Scotland in Duncan's place. As hard as Lady Macbeth tries to assure her husband that 'it's over', it's anything but. Macbeth's lies compound and his murders multiply as he struggles to hold on to power – and his sanity.This 'Macbeth' is an excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's play. Writers Jacob Koskoff, Michael Lesslie and Todd Louiso stick very close to their source material, in the film's language and its major plot points. Fassbender and Cotillard are perfectly cast and wonderfully matched in the main roles. They seem to actually live the lives of Macbeth and his Lady as they use every intellectual, emotional and physical tool they have to make these characters real. Throughout the movie, the actors are framed and the script is supported by the confident direction of Justin Kurzel, the amazing cinematography of Adam Arkapaw and the magnificent score of actor/composer (and the director's younger brother) Jed Kurzel.I admit that I didn't catch some (a lot) of the dialog, but I appreciated the movie more after I read a summary of the story. (I'd advise anyone who doesn't know the play, but is thinking of seeing the movie to do the same. What you might lose in terms of surprises, you'll make up in overall appreciation of the film.) Still, I would have liked to understand more of the dialog on first viewing and I think that there were ways to accomplish that without losing the beauty of the language, but this adaptation is outstanding either way. It would be unfortunate if the characters speaking in old English kept anyone from choosing to see this film, which excels on multiple levels. 'A-'",8,1,5,12 December 2015
13 Hours," '13 Hours' is an excellent fact-based, politically-neutral telling of a remarkable story.
","Making a movie with political undercurrents can be a risky proposition for a filmmaker. Even if the subject matter is not overtly political in and of itself, if it can be seen as political, Movie Fans who are politically aware may, whether consciously or unconsciously, project their political predispositions onto the film, even if they actually know very little about its tone or content. I consciously try my best not to prejudge a movie based on my personal feelings about its background, but, if I think it looks interesting, to see it and let it rise or fall on its own merits. That's an approach that I think would serve all Movie Fans well when deciding whether or not to see '13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi' (R, 2:24).The film is based on the 2014 book '13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi' by Boston University journalism professor Mitchell Zuckoff. I haven't read the book, but I'm here to tell you that the movie it has spawned is almost completely non-political. Telling the story of the well-coordinated terrorist attack on two U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, the movie never takes sides in the controversies that still swirl around the attack, its causes and its aftermath and never even mentions the names Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. There are a few passing references to some of the over-politicized aspects of this story, but those references remain fact-based, relevant to the plot and very brief. So, after talking about what this film isn't, let's talk about what it IS.As the film opens, Jack Silva (John Krasinski) is being picked up at the Benghazi airport by colleague Tyrone 'Rone' Woods, but the two men don't speak to each other or even make eye contact until they enter Rone's vehicle parked just outside the airport entrance. The low-key reunion is for reasons of safety and security. Jack is a short-term contractor who's in Libya to work with other former military special operators, part of a six-man detail providing security for a secretive (but not quite secret) CIA compound gathering intelligence and making contacts in post-civil war, post-Gadhafi Libya.The difficulties inherent in the contractors' mission are apparent in the first few scenes. On the way back from the airport, Rone and Jack are trapped in the middle of a traffic jam caused by what looks like a political assassination in broad daylight. They call for help from the CIA compound, but receive none. The two men only get through an impromptu local security checkpoint by using their wits and threatening violence. After arriving at the compound, Rone tries to give the local CIA station chief (David Costabile) a hard time about denying his request for assistance, but the boss is having none of it. His main concern is lying low and not violating the political parameters of his mission – no matter what.Jack meets the other members of the civilian security detail (played by David Denman, Dominic Fumusa, Max Martini and Pablo Schreiber) and begins going out on missions with the team. The men escort CIA employees as they meet up with their local contacts. Later, the team travels the 1.2 miles to coordinate with a two-man team providing security for a small U.S. State Department compound which is preparing to host Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, who wants to get more personally involved in reaching out more directly to the Libyan people, hopefully improving U.S.-Libyan relations. Rone's team is as concerned about the lack of physical and personnel security at the State Department compound as they are about similar problems at their CIA annex, but it's all part of the U.S. laying low in Libya.Then, on the evening of September 11, 2012, the proverbial sh** hits the fan. Libyan militants attack the State Department compound in Benghazi. Those two security personnel stationed there heroically fight to protect the ambassador and the handful of other U.S. government employees and contractors, but they desperately need help. They call over to the CIA annex, but political considerations get in the way of a timely response. Eventually, Rone's team gets to the annex and they do what they can, but soon have to pull out and fall back to the compound. The team is expecting a follow-up attack on their annex, so they do what they can to get ready. The rest of that night involves a hard-fought and selfless struggle for survival by the 30+ Americans in that annex, trying to hold on until help arrives – IF it arrives.Some movies centered on the military amount to little more than jingoistic nonsense and some movies directed by Michael Bay seem to exist merely as a platform for impressive visuals and lots of noise, but neither of these descriptions fits '13 Hours'. The former military special operators-turned security contractors aren't portrayed as supermen, saviors or saints, but simply as men trying to do a dangerous job the best they can, then get home to their families. American policies and activities in Libya are portrayed as well-meaning, but as difficult to classify as 'good or bad' as many of the Libyan people who the Americans encounter in this story. Michael Bay makes a tremendous effort to show the world as it is, tell a remarkable story as it happened and use his skills and experience to make an excellent movie. This politically neutral, exciting and inspiring fact-based account may make some Movie Fans uncomfortable, for a variety of reasons, but it's a story that deserves to be told and I'm thankful, for a variety of reasons, that it was told so well.

Sully," National treasures Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood tell the story of another national treasure, Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger.
","Many people remember, or have at least heard of, the 'Miracle on the Hudson', the 2009 landing of a disabled passenger jet on the Hudson River by Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, resulting in the survival of all of the plane's passengers and crew. But how much do we really know about the incident? In most cases, probably not much more than what was in that first sentence. That's what makes the story such a great idea for a movie. With Todd Komarnicki's adaptation of Sullenburger's 2009 memoir 'Highest Duty' as their guide, director Clint Eastwood and star Tom Hanks bring us the behind-the-scenes story of this incredible water landing and its aftermath in the drama 'Sully' (PG-13, 1:35).The film opens with a plane crash scene. It's a literal nightmare of Captain Sullenberger (Hanks), who is haunted by his experience of landing his airliner on the Hudson River – and what might have happened if things had gone differently. Different scenarios play out in Sully's head as he sleeps – and also while he's awake, forced to relive the incident by NTSB investigators. Their questions and the facts about the 'crash' (as they call it, 'forced water landing', as Sully calls it) lead Sully to second-guess himself and his actions, even as he is being hailed in the media and in person as a hero and he is being wholeheartedly supported by his wife, Lorraine Sullenberger (Laura Linney), via telephone from their California home.As the investigators (played by Mike O'Malley, Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn) repeatedly interview Sully and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), we hear information and arguments which will make most Movie Fans question whether Sully made the right call and whether he really is a hero. As Sully alternately struggles with those same issues and reaffirms his version of events for the skeptical investigators, we also see that short flight reenacted, from different perspectives and with more and more of the story coming to light. We also get a taste of the media frenzy which surrounded Sully and his family, and see flashback scenes of Sully's earlier experiences flying as a teenager and in the military.The combination of the vast movie-making experience of Eastwood (directing his 35th feature) and Hanks (with over 30 years' worth of films on his resume) has resulted in an interesting and well-conceived telling of Sully's experiences. Much like the NTSB investigation at the center of the story, the film uses what most of us didn't know about the 'Miracle on the Hudson' to dramatic effect, telling the untold story as if peeling back the layers of an onion. Besides a more complete picture of this incredible incident (and another reminder of how talented Eastwood and Hanks are), the film also gives us a subtle but profound reminder that there is, and never will be, a substitute for human experience, intuition and guts. 'Sully' may not be a thrill-a-minute movie, but it uses every one of its 95 minutes very well. 'A-'",8,1,3,13 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," 'Alien: Covenant' may lack the creativity of the last film and the freshness of the original, but it excels in action and terror.
","Fans of the 'Fast & Furious' and 'Star Wars' franchises know that the release dates of those movies don't follow the same chronological order as the events portrayed (and there are short films and features in between) but those timelines have nothing on the 'Alien' franchise. It all started simply enough: 'Alien', a relatively low budget sci-fi horror flick released in 1979, thrilled, scared and shocked Movie Fans, while adding to the cultural consciousness the indelible image of a vicious, reptilian-like creature busting out of the chest of its human host, while also making Sigourney Weaver a household name as she played the iconic alien fighter Ellen Ripley in four of the movies. A new feature film from the 'Alien' universe appeared every 5-7 years (not counting the 'Alien vs. Predator' movies), leading up to 2017's 'Alien: Covenant' (R, 2:02), which, in some ways, returns the franchise to its storied roots.After the 'Alien' sequels, 'Aliens', 'Alien 3' and 'Alien: Resurrection' (each of the four with a different director), original helmer Ridley Scott returned to the franchise for a prequel series. 2012's 'Prometheus' began exploring the question of how the Aliens originated. That was an excellent film, but was more '2001: A Space Odyssey' than 'Aliens', for example, and it did a great job of setting up the films to come. From 2012-2017, ten(!) short films came out to fill gaps in the Alien story, with two of them leading straight into 'Alien: Covenant'. A small amount of footage from those two films (known collectively as 'Alien: Covenant – Prologue') are used in the 2017 feature and in its theatrical trailers. In the 'Alien' universe, this film is a sequel to 'Prometheus' and leads fans closer to the events of the original film. In 'Star Wars' terms, it's the equivalent of 'Episode II - Attack of the Clones', but better.Taking place ten years after the events in 'Prometheus', this film follows a colony ship, called the Covenant, heading toward the other side of the galaxy. On board are 2,000 colonists in a deep stasis, 1,000 human embryos, a dozen crew members and a synthetic android named Walter (Michael Fassbender), an advanced version of the synthetic known as David in the previous film. On their way to a planet called Origae-6, the ship is hit by shockwave, causing significant damage and leading Walter to awaken the crew. In the process, the captain (James Franco) dies and first officer Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) assumes command of the Covenant. As the crew is coming to terms with what has happened and working to repair the ship, they receive a radio transmission that appears to be human in origin. The planet that is the source of the transmission appears to be an even more hospitable spot for their new colony, so rather than wait another seven years to arrive at Origae-6, Oram decides to check it out.As the Covenant, piloted by the cowboy hat-wearing Tennessee (Danny McBride) orbits this new planet, most of the crew takes a lander down to the planet's surface. The expedition consists of acting captain Oram, his wife, biologist Karen Oram (Carmen Ejogo), a terraforming expert named Daniels (Katherine Waterston), security head Sergeant Lope (Demián Bichir), members of his team and a couple others. While exploring the area around their landing site and beginning to evaluate the planet for possible human habitation, their discoveries range from odd to shocking to deadly. There are signs of human cultivation of what appears to be wheat, but at the same time there are no signs of animals or birds. The expedition finds the crashed ship Prometheus, along with the fully functioning David, who says that Elizabeth Shaw (the sole human survivor of the doomed ship) repaired the injuries he sustained on that earlier mission. Something else that the crew of the Covenant finds are alien spores which, if they enter a human host, result in the birth of vicious creatures which are very new to the unfortunate souls of the Covenant – and will also be somewhat new to Movie Fans. Thus begins a desperate struggle for survival.'Alien: Covenant' is a worthy and exciting addition to the 'Alien' franchise. Making this set of deep space travelers colonists who all have significant others on the ship raises the emotional stakes for the characters and for the audience. The interactions between the twin synthetic androids from different generations makes for a fascinating subplot, partly because of the acting prowess of Fassbender, who, along with the rest of the cast contribute to a talented ensemble who all deliver excellent performances. The story effectively builds on 'Prometheus' and towards 'Alien' with a flare that ups the franchise ante on horror and gore, while the wicked twists wonderfully tease a sequel. This film, however, can't really be said to be very 'original'. Besides the intended connections to 'Prometheus' and the 'Alien' movies, it's also a bit of 2016's 'Passengers' meets 1991's 'Terminator 2'. 'Alien: Covenant' may lack the creativity of the last film and the freshness of the original, but it excels in action and terror. 'A-'",8,103,197,16 May 2017
