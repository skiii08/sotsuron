Joker," Uncomfortable
","If I were to use one word to describe this film, it would be uncomfortable. This is great, since it's clear this is exactly what this film feels like it's trying to do. That said, the soundtrack was great, and fit the tone really well, all performances hit the bar for me. That said, it's still not a perfect film. For one, I think the film should have ended in the streets during the scene on the police car instead of in the prison, leaving the impression that the joker os free. Also, if the makeup of the joker could change over time to look more and more like Heath Ledger. I guess this kinda happened when he spread the blood across his cheeks, but this could have had a lot more weight to it if his makeup changed over time with the character. Overall, highly recommended.",8,1,1,9 October 2019
Goodfellas," One of the greats
","One of the greats, not perfect, but what the godfather should have been. Amazing music and outstandong acting throughout, any scene could be the first scene of the film, and the narrator keeps the story going without telling too much. I seem to remember film grain being an issue on my DVD copy, but might have just been a crap copy.",8,0,0,10 October 2019
The Godfather," Maybe I don't get it
","This film acurately depicted scenes from the book very well, and the acting is good. That said, not all books cross to film well. This is one such instance, in my opinion. Beyond the faithful recreations of some classic scenes, I don't see what there is to like. I'm sure some people say they just like it because it's popular.",5,1,8,10 October 2019
