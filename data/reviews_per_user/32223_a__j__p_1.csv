Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a long wait for nothing
","After years of waiting for this to come out i was sadly dissapointed for many reasons.Anikin's acting was very wooden- they should have gotten the kid from the 6th sense to do the role- then the film would have been a bit better. Darth Maul was a pathetic villan, after waiting almost 15 years for this film, i expected a better character development on behalf of Lucas' team.When will Lucas realise that Visual Effects dont make a movie, good script and acting do!!! My suggestion for George is to develop a better script and cast some people who can act, if he wants episode 2 to be as sucessful as the first 3.",Null,7,14,9 March 2001
