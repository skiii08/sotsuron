The Avengers," Marvel's own Expendables team
","What a great action packed movie of Marvel's finest. It took me some time to finally get a chance to watch it and it is just phenomenal. What can I say about this movie. The acting was good, the story was OK, the special effects were nonetheless impressive and the Heroes' costumes were great. I agree with a friend of mine on this and that is The Avengers is Marvel's own Expendables. The All- Star team that everyone roots for. I also liked the ever comedic lines of Tony Stark as portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., he is quite the character. There were some other comedic spots of the movie that kind of fit and I just couldn't stop laughing even the audience was laughing with me. However there were some disappointments for me. Number One, Hulk wasn't played by Ed Norton, instead we got Mark Ruffalo. In my opinion, he just felt out of place. I mean, Evans, Downey, and Hemsworth are top-notch A-Listers and then you got Ruffalo who just doesn't fit in with them and Number Two, I was expecting Red Skull over Loki. (That's just me.) Loki was a good formidable villain for the Avengers but I think Red Skull would have made the movie even more kick ass. Overall, this gets a 9 out of 10.",9,2,7,8 May 2012
Skyfall," A very good Bond!
","I happened to catch Skyfall last night and all I kept thinking was that somehow this Bond would be inferior to QoS. I was totally wrong! It was actually pretty damn good. The car chases were great, the story was good, the action crisp and the villain was just...something. Javier Bardem did a great job as a villain. There was just an interesting presence about him. It just made his character become more along the lines of a Super- Villain. He's no Blofeld, but hey he did a great job.Daniel Craig with his stoic Bond behavior did a good job playing out the legendary agent. However, I felt he was getting tired of this role and the fact that this was it, the conclusion of the Bond saga. The bond women, I was questioning. The theory that the 1st girl usually dies but here, the bond theory is broken! That blew me away but what really made me happy, the Aston Martin DB5 is back! (Thank you Top Gear for that one)All of those just blew my mind and I left the theater happy. All of these factors made this Bond a stunning conclusion to the 50 year saga. There were a few minor details that I didn't appreciate but overall, Skyfall gets my approval. Overall, 8 out of 10.",8,1,7,22 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Awesome Trek
","Before I dive into the movie, I just want to admit that I'm not that big of a Trek fan. I am familiar with the movies and to be honest, Wrath of Khan and Search for Spock were movies I remember watching and liked. I consider myself a sci-fi fan, a fan of just science fiction. Trek, Star Wars, and whatnot, I don't care. Anyway, when going into seeing this movie, for some reason, Wrath of Khan was stuck in my head. As the movie went on, I awed and laughed. The story was good, the cast did a phenomenal job, the effects were good and practically everything else was just solid. Of course, then came the moments where it finally dawned on me that this like a pseudo remake of Wrath of Khan. I was a little upset but putting that aside, this movie was in my opinion just as good as the other. Abrams did a phenomenal job of creating a stellar movie to add to the Star Trek Franchise. It is by far better than TNG saga (Generations, Insurrection, First Contact and Nemesis). Replay value is slightly above average if I want to see this again in theaters or wait until DVD release. Overall, I give this an 8 out of 10.",8,2,7,25 May 2013
Transformers," Childhood Ruined
","Okay, I'm going to flat out say that this is the worst live action adaptation of a popular 80s cartoon and toy franchise. Transformers was my favorite show from my childhood. (Even though they were reruns.) I collected the toys, (G1 and Beast Wars) and watched any adaptation from Beast Wars up to Armada and Energon. When i heard about this movie, my thought was OK better see it. I was dead wrong. After watching what i saw it officially killed my childhood. There were some good things about it, the special effects were cool, the voice cast was awesome especially hearing Peter Cullen's voice again. (I was happy bout that.) The downsides were a combination of the following: poor storyline, very bad cheesy acting and Megan Fox. What was her purpose of the movie? NONE. Sex appeal, OK but in this case, NO! Another downside is the fact that out of all the transformers, they leave out the 2 best ones: Hot Rod and Cliffjumper What would have made this movie better would be better story writing and character development.",4,0,2,25 March 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Status Lock Sequel
","The one was bad and now came the next one and its far worse than I expected. If the first one was bad, why bother making a second. Why, Mr. Bay, why? Well for starters, the story was once again poorly written, the cast was ridiculous then before and of course, for me, no Cliffjumper or Hot Rod. Come on, its a damn shame and worse way to spend a Saturday night to see this horrible sequel and its so bad that it puts itself into Status Lock. However, i will say some good things about this movie. The effects were still good, the voice acting was crisp and he action was insane. Still, there is a lot to improve on. This is like strike 2 for Michael Bay. If only if they improved on the story and casted better people, this movie would have been a success.",4,1,6,25 March 2012
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Thank you Coppola
","Quite possibly one of the best Dracula films. I got to say this is a true masterpiece of bringing Bram Stokers work to life on the silver screen. The acting was crisp, the sets were amazing, the special effects were good. Overall this gets my stamp of approval for best horror movie. Gary Oldman as Dracula was actually pretty good. I mean he's no Bela Legosi or Christopher Lee, he played the part pretty damn good. The thing i liked about Dracula was the many depictions that Coppola decided to put into this movie. Lets count: 1-Human at the beginning 2-Trademark vampire form 3-Human disguise when he is England 4-Beast in the courtyard scene 5-Rats in the wooden crate on the ship 6-Giant Bat Form 7-Wolf form All were greatly executed and carried out well throughout the movie. I kind of liked the Hammer Draculas but this one just puts Dracula over the top.I recommend this movie to any Dracula fan out there.",8,1,3,23 March 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A Nolan Masterpiece
","OK, before I review this movie, I want to do a quick recap of Batman. The first Batman with Michael Keaton was a phenomenal movie that defined Burton's career. Batman Returns was an OK sequel despite having a dark setting. Batman Forever was a somewhat inferior addition to Batman, (That one I was on the fence between loving it or hating it), Batman and Robin was HORRIBLE. Suddenly, Nolan comes along and makes Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and this one. Somehow they all topped the other Batman films. This one was no exception. This has got to be the most greatest conclusion of the Nolan Batman trilogy. The story was great, the characters were good, and everything was just on par with the best formula for a Great Movie! Christian Bale still defined his role as Gotham's hero and billionaire n resident. Tom Hardy played Bane really well, although the voice just seemed a little out of tone and out of place. Anne Hathaway did a great job playing Catwoman, even though I felt she was an odd addition but hey, she's a great actress. Anyway, this was just a remarkable movie and possibly the best movie of 2012 so far!!! I felt wowed, I cheered a little and I almost came to tears because it was just so damn good. Nolan brought my favorite DC Hero to life in the 3 movies that were made. He deserves to be considered a Hollywood Icon. This movie gets my overall score of 10!",10,4,8,14 August 2012
