The Longest Yard," terrible waste of time, this film spoils itself
","I'm a big Sandler fan - loved Gilmore, loved Maddison, hated this. It was not only the worst Adam Sandler film I've seen, it was one of the worst films I've ever seen...full stop (or 'period' if you like). I've never seen the original film and now I don't want to.There were one or two whimsical moments but nowhere near the level of humour I have come to expect from Sandler films. Even the appearance of Rob Schneider with his Waterboy shout of 'You Can Do It' could not make me laugh as my soul had already died by that point. If you don't like American Football then there's really nothing in this film for you. What was it? Action, Drama, Comedy? I've read other reviews which claims it is the latter but if so, where's the funny bits? OK, the guy with the hormone replacement got a few chuckles, Chris Rock made the same joke he's been making for years....over and over again.....the horny old hag was nothing new....the stupid big gentle guy..........Extremely disappointing to say the least. Anger Management was poor, this was worse. Shampoo is better.",2,9,20,14 September 2005
The Patriot," awful
","It may well be 'just a movie' and not historically accurate, blah blah blah, but it is also a terrible, boring and predictable waste of what seemed like 12 hours.  Every single line and scene was of no surprise to me as I guessed my way through what the dialogue would be and was right every time.While not a historical documentary, the portrayal of the British (English!)armies was diabolically stereotyped, wrong and almost racist. This is coming from a proud Scot!This movie is awful.",Null,2,3,9 September 2002
