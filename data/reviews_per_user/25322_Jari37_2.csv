The New World," Far too 'arty'
","When I first viewed the cast for this movie, i was intrigued, and thought I'd give it a go. Alas, I was left disappointed.Colin Farrell gives a slow performance as the lead role, and thus, the film seems a little flat footed. The plot has been done before, allowing for few surprises or turns and I found myself bored half-way through. Terrence Malicks appears to focus more on the natural side of The Americas, before Europeans arrived, and the result is a little hazy. With atmospheric music and random polarised shots of swamp land and forest, the whole thing seemed to be trying too hard to make an epic impression.One of the pluses from the movie is the performance from Q'Orianka Kilcher as the evergreen figure, Pocahontas. For such a young actress, she came across as very natural on screen, next to the big guns; Bale and Farrell. The sets were also very impressive, with a realistic creation of James Town, and the Indigenous villages providing a more life-like back drop for the film.Sadly, the action was just too slow to captivate me as a viewer, wishing to be entertained. The soundtrack was so low that it was difficult to follow dialogue, and I feel Malicks rather loses the effect of what is essentially, an age-old love film which is a shame, as all the ingredients where available for a sound picture. This, in my opinion, could have been so much better.",4,2,7,5 August 2007
Green Street Hooligans," A violently compulsive 'soccer' film
","I had a few hang-ups about this film before I'd actually seen it. Firstly, the casting of Elijah Wood as a violent football hooligan seemed a little strange, as well as a million miles away from middle earth. Secondly, I had an issue with the whole idea of giving so much attention to such a horrible facet of the sport.However, having sat down to watch this film I was pleasantly surprised. Yes there are a few wooden moments, but overall I enjoyed the acting. The way in which the actors portrayed their characters as irresistible rogues was really top draw, and I was pleased that Lexi Alexander didn't try to sugar coat the whole world of the football firms. The fight scenes are certainly not for the screamish, with blood and gut a plenty, but I found the rawness of these scenes compelling.As for Wood, I think he is helped by the excellent performance of Charlie Hunnam, but he still pitches in a sturdy performance. However, the sight of the Iowa born actor, downing pints of lager and belching football songs down at the local, was a bit odd to watch.All in all, I would certainly recommend this movie to any fan of this growing genre, as films such as The Football Factory, fall massively such of this rugged depiction of life in the football firms.",8,0,0,26 July 2007
