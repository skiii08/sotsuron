Raiders of the Lost Ark," A boy's childhood summarized.
",This movie made a little boy's childhood awesome. I think I was 6-7 years old when I saw it the first time. All these easy-going adventure scenes made a very huge impact for the rest of my childhood. The archaeologist that put on his hat and whip and travel around the world to solve mysteries and fight Nazis and some how survives it all. It is so classic! Iconic movie. Just see it. The End. 10/10,10,1,2,26 October 2017
American Made," Flying high. Flying fast. Tom Cruise plays an American dreamer in the 1980's!
","Welcome to the 80's! Everything is a bit crazy and the drugs and weapon must always be delivered in time. Money does never stop coming in. Fast high flying scenes with a high rolling Tom Cruise at it's steering wheel. They really nail the 80's feeling in this picture and everything gives you a cool vibe. Drugs, weapons, jungle, cartel, CIA, Pablo Escobar. This movie got it all. Very enjoyable.",9,0,3,26 October 2017
