The Ring," Scariest movie I've seen in a long time
","This movie was well written.  I have not been scared (chills in my arms) in many years. Most movies just don't do it for me, but this one kept me pullin' the covers up to my chin.  You'll like it.  I will see it again to catch things I missed the first time.  So will you.  Enjoy the fright.",9,1,1,4 January 2004
The Ring," Scariest Movie EVER ... well, except for Fatal Attraction
","OK, NOTHING is scarier than Fatal Attraction ... that COULD and HAS happened so that's real ... REAL SCARY.  However, this movie is also scary but in a 'bad dream' way.  It couldn't happen but ... neither could Frankenstein recreate human life.  At places it seemed a bit 'campy' but that may well be a result of my age and the difference between my age and that of the principal characters in the movie.  However, I was able to look past these short burst of 'camp factor' and enjoy a really scary flick.  I judge a movie and its power to impress me based on, what I call, the 'chill' factor. This movie gave me big time CHILLS.  My flesh was crawling all over the place as I watched the 'monster chick' climb out of the well.  I'll bet it does the same thing to you ... over and over again.",9,1,2,8 August 2004
The Village," Worse than Plan 9 from Outer Space
","This is the most stupid movie I have EVER seen.  Slow?  The BLOB moved faster.  Plot?  What plot?  I waisted $6 but I'm saving you $6+.  Nice guy that I am.  I should have flushed the $6 down the toilet and saved the time too.  No movie is cheap to produce.  Even the cheapest cost $1,000,000. This one MUST have cost $30,000,000, considering the NAME players in it and... some fool was paid to edit the damn thing.  They could have flushed their production cost down that same drain with my $6;  the end result would be the same ... a plugged up toilet.  Hey, if you'd feel better, don't go and send me a buck for the advise.  You'll miss seeing this tripe and I'll have a dollar of my money back ... sounds like a DEAL to me.",1,3,6,8 August 2004
Seabiscuit," Academy
",This movie touched me on many levels.  My father told me of this wonderful horse when I was a kid.  He called it the greatest horse to ever run.  So it brought back memories of my father and his admiration for the horse. I now more fully understand his words of praise. Jeff B. has never given a more compelling performance and Tobey M. made me feel his spirit as he fought his way through life.  Great supporting role.Refreshing to not have to hear all the profanity and see nudity on constant display. A movie for all ages.If this movie does not win the Best Picture Oscar then someone will need to explain to me why they even have the Oscar. GREAT MOVIE.,Null,0,0,2 August 2003
8 Mile," Grimy and real ... except for that on thing.
","I enjoyed the movie; I didn't think I would.  I'm in my mid-50's and think rap 'music' is a huge DAH.  Music?  Oh come now.  'The Pianist' has music. But this '8 Mile' was surprisingly uplifting in a very strange and disturbing way.  The Eminem character was, as he said, 'White Trash' but he was willing to work to make his daily bread.  I admire that.  He had a dream (being a rapper) and he fit that dream into his real job work schedule. Good kid without ANY positive adult guidance.Oh, and that 'ONE THING'?  Kim Basinger was a poor choice for her role, though she did a creditable job. I would have believed Rosanne Barr way more because she fits the 'physeodynamic' more accurately. Of course, if she'd been in the movie I'd never have watched it...still, she fits the 'white-slob trailer-trash Wal-Mart queen' role much better than KB.  Or perhaps they needed to have KB smokin' a bunch of crank or crack, like the character in 'City By The Sea', then I could better see KB in that role. Anyway, it's a good movie.",Null,0,0,21 September 2003
Signs," Yawn and snore
",I literally slept through about 15 minutes of this major yawn.  The writing was very transparent and predictable.  The action was a big 'so what'. Character development was stiff and ultra-corny.  I enjoy most of Mel's work but this was very lame and schmultzy.  Don't waist your cash ... wait for HBO and you'll send me a 'thank you' note.,2,1,1,2 September 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," WUNDERBAR
","Like the Coen brothers' other masterwork, Fargo, this film was extremely well written and directed.  Of course, HOMER did have a small hand in it. Hope you have the same response to this film as I did and that it enriches you as much as it did me.  Own this one; it will be considered a classic in the world of film.  The music is also fantastic.",10,1,3,9 July 2002
