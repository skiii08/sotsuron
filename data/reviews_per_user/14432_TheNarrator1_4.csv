The Expendables 2," A lot of explosions and killing but no acting
","I am not going to lie this movie was amazing to watch but i just wish that the writers of this movie made it more seriously. I know people wanted to see the comedy along with the action but i think they should have made less jokes and more action. The part where Arnold said ill be back, from the classic terminator and when he said the Bruce Wills die hard line 'yippe kiyay', it just made me realize this was a movie. When you watch a good movie you should be so distracted by the movie that you think its real, This movie just lacked seriousness and acting. Otherwise this was a very good movie that does deserve a watch! Don't have high hopes on the acting, but the action more than makes up for it.",4,1,4,21 August 2012
Skyfall," Best. Bond. Movie. Ever.
","I wont reveal any of the details of the movie to you because you probably want to see it, but this movie i have to say is amazing. there isn't a moment where you aren't on the edge of your seat wanting more. For me this was the best bond movie, it is certainly a bounce back from the last bond movie, but i am not going to get into that right now. Daniel Craig plays an amazing bond, rugged and tough, how it should be. I was unsure of Javier Bardem as a villain but man he is good. This movie i think will be huge, it has everything a movie watcher wants. if you didn't plan on seeing it, it's 100% worth watching and 100% worth the wait.",8,121,245,23 October 2012
The Bourne Legacy," What actors can do for a bad movie!
","I don't think there is one movie watcher that hasn't at least one Bourne movie. The original Bourne trilogy might be the best of its kind thats why it makes it very difficult to make a spin off like they tried to do here. The acting was amazing, Jeremy Renner and Edward Norton have the potinal to make the up coming bourne movies a lot better but in this one they were just blind sided. The script was not well done at all, the story line was spotty throughout the movie it was just not a well done movie but the actors did the best they could with it!However I don't think it was a complete failure, the directors and producers have to learn from this mistake and use this as a stepping stone to a better upcoming Bourne movie!Its definitely worth a watch but if you were as big of a original Bourne fan as me, you might find it to be a let down!",7,1,5,24 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan did it again. Amazing. Masterpiece.
","OK the DK trilogy has to be one of the best of all time, if not the best! Nolan began with a bang and he sure ended with one! The TDKR was a masterpiece every detail was done perfectly. This is one of those movies that didn't hold nothing back everything that could possibly happen in these types of movies, happened in this! Nolan sure knows how to finish off an amazing trilogy, but i have to say it was not all his doing it could not be done without Bale, Hardy, Caine, Oldman, and Freeman! Even to spite my thoughts of this casting mistake, Anne Hathaway was an amazing catwoman!This is truly was of the greatest movies every made! if you haven't watched it already, you need to right now! P.S even though Heath Ledger was not in this movie, he produced probably the greatest acting spectacle of all time, he made batman what it is today!",8,4,10,30 August 2012
