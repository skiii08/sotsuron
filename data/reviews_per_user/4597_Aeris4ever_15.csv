Requiem for a Dream," This is a 'true' horror movie
","When I finished watching this movie last night, it was 2 AM and I was alone. I was practically shivering in horror at what I had just seen, and I felt like curling into a ball with my pillow in hand.  Watching this movie is like watching a close friend deteriorate before your very eyes.  I had to hit the mute button during the ending montage and peek through my fingers at the TV.  I normally don't watch films like this, but this one had been tempting me for months, so I finally gave in.  I'm really glad I did, but part of me wished I hadn't.'Requiem' is such a powerful film that deserves the acclaim it has  gotten. Drug addiction is the obvious element here, but there's much more underneath: love, betrayal, loneliness, and desperation.  Ellen Burnstyn does a superior job as Sara Goldfarb, an aging widow and mother who lives alone in her apartment.  Her son, Harry, makes his living dealing drugs with his friend, Tyrone.  Harry's girlfriend, Marion, who's also an addict, are living together and trying to establish a good living.  Ms. Goldfarb knows nothing of her son's real life, and fantasizes about his future, as well as her own when she receives an offer to appear as a contestant on a television show.  Her story alone makes this film - it's heart-wrenching and traumatizing to watch.  The three kids got what they deserved, in my opinion, but Sara was the innocent, loving mother who didn't deserve such a fate.The incredible, albeit a bit cartoony, camera cuts work very well.  I loved the music in this film and how it was used.  It was unsettling to hear the music all discordant when the characters began their respective freefalls. The ending montage, if you have the guts to watch it, unlike myself, is a visual wonder, from the little bits that I saw.  If the film could be stripped of its nudity, this would be an excellent film for at-risk teens and high school students.  This is where the three young adults' stories are powerful.  Drugs might be fun for a while, but soon you're hanging onto a train and you either keep riding it 'til your life gives out, or let go and face a long, hellish recovery.  But in this case, the train stopped, leaving the kids out in the cold.  Witnessing what they have to do to feed their addictions is truly sad and it's something every teen should see.This is a harsh film, very horrifying and not good for sensitive viewers. Did I enjoy it?  Not really.  Is it a brilliant film?  Absolutely.  I knew this was an excellent film when it was over, but I didn't enjoy it much. Though, honestly, this isn't a film to be enjoyed, because what you see is isn't at all joyous.  It's a film to be experienced, and what an experience you'll get!  I won't give this film a grade, it's not a fair measure with a film like this, but I highly recommend it.",Null,0,0,6 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good movie, but doesn't quite fit with the originals
","Having been a huge Star Wars fan since a child, I was thrilled when Phantom Menace came out.  I saw it 4 times in the theater and loved it just the same.  But with Episode II almost in theaters, I feel a need to defend Episode I.  It was very different from the original trilogy with a variety of new elements.  Episode I showed children for the first time in the entire series, something I don't think many fans realized.  Jake Lloyd did the best he could with the character that was meant to act like goofy kid and not a lifeless slave.  Yes, the midiclorian-thing is rubbish and Jar Jar is the worst thing to ever happen in the series, but if you look past that, you'll see that Phantom Menace was a pretty good movie.  I think hype is what killed it.  I've noticed the hype around Ep. II is pretty subdued compared to Ep. I, and that's a good thing.  The biggest problem with P.M. is that it tried to be too many things at once.  It tried to please the older fans of the original trilogy by introducing a cool villain, light-saber battles, a complicated Trade Federation plot and the inclusion of younger versions of favorite characters from the originals.  At the same time, Lucas was trying entertain to kids, some of them not knowing a thing about Star Wars.  Here's where young Anakin and his friends, Jar Jar and those annoying pod race commentators come into play.  The result is that each audience likes certain things, but hates the rest.  Try explaining why Senator Palpatine is evil to a 6-year old, or try getting a 27-year old to giggle at Jar Jar's stupidity.  It doesn't work. That's my reasoning as to why this movie wasn't very well-received by long-time fans.  I think it's a great movie in itself, but when compared to the first trilogy, it's hard to remember that P.M. is really a Star Wars movie.  I think as the new trilogy progresses, the connection will be made.",Null,0,1,22 April 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Think hard about your children before taking them to E.T.
","And I really mean that.  Like wicket, who posted a comment earlier, I was terrified during the entire death sequence of 'E.T.'  So terrified that my dad had to take me out of the theater.  I was 5 back then, my first movie theater experience; definitely not a good one.  If you have sensitive children who are afraid of monsters or intense E.R.-type action, complete with defibrillators and scary men in spacesuits, spare them the agony and leave them at home.  E.T. is barely cute to begin with.  When he's white, half dead and screaming on the bathroom floor, he's absolutely horrifying. And all the while, he's sucking the life out of Elliot, making him seem even more evil.  It's a shame that a movie with such a good beginning and ending had to be tainted with intense scenes that could ruin the entire experience for some children.  I've already been scarred by this movie, so I know I won't see its re-release.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 8, but it really depends on the child.  'E.T.' is not family-friendly, in my opinion.",Null,0,1,13 March 2002
My Neighbor Totoro," A very sweet movie everyone should see
","While I'm not a huge anime fan, I've slowly becoming one and have had the pleasure of seeing some fabulous anime, including 'My Neighbor Totoro'. Loved all over the world, this is an animated film that's perfect for kids and adults of all ages.  This is also a must-see for anyone who is interested in Japanese animation, as it's one of the classics, along with 'Akira' and 'Princess Mononoke'.The movie begins with two little girls and their father moving into an old house in the Japanese countryside, while their mother is in a nearby hospital recovering from an undisclosed illness.  Five-year old Mei and Satsuki, her older sister (about 10), help their father fix the house up, along with several of their neighbors.  The girls' father is a professor at the university and leaves Mei in the care of Nanny, the elderly woman next door, while Satsuki is at school.  When school is over, Satsuki and Mei are alone until their father comes home late at night.  One day, Mei follows some tiny creatures into a forest where she meets Totoro, a huge, furry, teddy bear-like creature.  Both girls befriend him and when they need help, Totoro is right there.Mr. Miyazaki is a genius when it comes to portraying children in their most pure form.  Both girls are rowdy and loud and are very realistic for animated characters.  There are many charming scenes including my favorite where Mei captures a dustbunny and runs off to find Satusuki.  She bumps into Nanny for the first time and screams in fright, then runs around the door to get away.  She then bumps into Nanny again and screams.  It's an adorable scene, I can't do it justice here.  The animation is very fluid and the characters move like real people.  Just watch how Mei toddles around with her chubby legs bowed outwards, like a real pre-schooler.As much as I loved this movie, there's one key element I wasn't fond of: Totoro himself.  He seemed more menacing than harmless, especially when he roared directly in the girls' faces, baring his huge teeth.  Small children may find the noise frightening.  Granted it is a cartoon, but Totoro looked like he was abusing illegal substances and acted like he was, too.  I found nothing about Totoro charming; he was just one creepy critter.  His bizarre behavior is probably more noticeable to older viewers, though, as children may be more in awe of the huge furry guy.Here's a few notes for parents who might be questioning whether this is a good movie for their child.  'My Neighbor Totoro' is great as a small lesson in Japanese culture.  Some tidbits: The huge rice paddies, the family bathing together as a bonding activity, the fact that shoes are not worn indoors (watch Satsuki walk around on her knees).  If your child can handle Disney's 'Bambi', this movie will be a piece of cake.  There are a few minor parts parents may be concerned about, including the very unsafe operation of a bicycle and the childrens' emotional distress in several situations. These are all very minor and shouldn't interfere with anyone's enjoyment of this classic anime film.  A 9/10.",Null,0,1,25 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas has followed his story exactly, whether we like it or not
","I mean this in George Lucas' defense.  One of the major complaints I see with AOTC is that the Jedi are dull and lifeless, as well as everyone else in the Republic.  They're supposed to be!  That's the life of the Jedi, being the peacemakers of society.  Even Ben mentions in ANH that before the Empire, everything was more civilized and sophisticated.  The reason everything/one is so relaxed in the original 3 movies is because there in no Republic, just a band of freedom fighters called the Rebellion who are trying to overthrow the Empire.  The scenes of the Imperial army in the old trilogy were boring in the same sense the Republic political scenes are boring.  We're seeing AOTC through the eyes of the good guys who are still in charge, not the little group of bad guys trying to overthrow the good ones.  It's the opposite of what we saw in the originals, a totally different perspective, and it works great in the overall story.The story belongs to Lucas and he's presenting it exactly the way it needs to be shown.  Whether we like it or not is our problem.  I admire the way AOTC turned out.  It's way better than TPM and even that movie wasn't so bad, it's part of the story.  I give this one an A- overall.",10,0,0,19 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Much like Empire Strikes Back, it is
","Yes, it's true, at least the last hour and a half.  The beginning is slow, full of political talk and scenes that look like they belong in Phantom Menace.  But once Jango Fett comes into the picture, the movie really picks up and is very enjoyable.  Hard-core fans should be impressed, especially those who did like the Ep. I characters since most of them are back for Ep. II.  It's similar to Ep. V, the middle-half of the original trilogy in some aspects.I won't bother talking about the FX because they're incredible beyond words. But I will say that I fully support the digital Yoda, he looks so real and much better than the creepy puppet from Ep.I.The actors are great, all of them are much more expressive and human than they were in Ep.I.  Samuel L. Jackson finally gets to do something besides sit and Padme no longer speaks like a droid.  Hayden was great as Anakin, very believable and into the character.This is a must-see for all Star Wars fans, I'd rank it tied with Ep. V (Empire) for 2nd as my favorite movie in the series.  Once you get past the first hour, it gets really good.",10,0,0,15 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Gorgeous movie, but not my favorite
","I found my disappointment with LOTR kind of shocking since I enjoy fantasy and science fiction, to a degree.  This movie is definitely the prettiest movie ever made.  The scenery is beautiful and most of it's REAL, with real grass and trees.  I like CG effects, but it's great to see a film that doesn't rely on them for every background.  I was in awe of all the visuals, everything from costuming to the props.My only problem was the movie's length.  I really think a good half hour or more could been trimmed off the final cut.  The extra footage is a treat for Tolkien fans, but for the newbies, like myself, it was too much.  After a particular encounter in the cave with the steep stairway, I started estimating how much time was left to go.  The action sequences were great and captivating, but the downtime made the movie hard to sit through.For me, LOTR is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen, but it was also the loudest movie I've ever heard.  Maybe it was just the theater, but the sound effects were way too loud.  I spent the last half of the movie with my left ear pressed into my hand to block out some of the noise.  This probably contributed to my impatience towards the end.  Still a nice film, though, and should've won the Oscar over 'A Beautiful Mind'.  Its loss further proves that entertaining movies never win Best Picture, only the artistic crap.",10,1,1,23 May 2002
Save the Last Dance," A bundle of issues, wrapped nicely for teens
","I finally broke down and saw this movie the other night and was surprised at how much I disliked it.  First off, I'm past my teens, but I did dance for a long time growing up, so this film looked interesting.  But if you're looking for a dance film, the abysmal 'Center Stage' is a better choice. What you'll get with 'Save The Last Dance' is an over-dramatized lesson on urban city life.  Every issue you can imagine is thrown into this movie, but none of them are focused on nearly enough, making them worthless in the end. Yeah, we learn that Nikki is upset at Sara for stealing all the good black men.  And we learn about teenage motherhood.  But none of them are developed enough.  Why is Nikki all happy at the end while watching Sara dance?  Did I miss something?  Sean Patrick Thomas was very good, I'll admit, but his character was too sweet to be real.  Julia Stiles is a bit too strong of a personality here. Sara is a strange character, I can't explain why.  Chenille was cute, but the actress looked 10 years too old for the role.  The minor characters were walking stereotypes, especially Malakai.  I'd give the best actor award to the guy who played Sara's father.  He was the most real of all the characters.The dancing sequences weren't captivating at all.  The camera angles change constantly to hype the audience, but they just annoyed me.  Obviously, Julia had a pointe-double, and I couldn't stand the camera switching between the two.  It really killed any intensity that Julia's final dance might have had.  I wouldn't really call this a 'dance movie'.  It's more of an urban movie disguised as a dance movie to lure in middle-class, white, teenaged girls.  Too bad the movie shows black, city life in such a negative way.",Null,0,2,28 February 2002
Spider-Man," Enjoyable movie for everyone
","First off, I want to say I'm a huge Star Wars fan and thought AOTC kicked butt.  That seems irrelevant, but with the 'war' between Spider-man and Star Wars fans, it needed to be said.  Especially since I've never been a Spider-man fan or a fan of any other comic book hero.  The whole thing is new to me.  But I saw 'Spider-man' and thought it was excellent.  It's not without flaws, but what movie isn't?The CG effects worked out well and weren't overused.  Some of them looked super cheesy in the previews, but you hardly notice them in the movie.  I'll never understand why so many people are against CG effects, especially with this movie and Attack of the Clones.  Sorry, but stringing up a 2-inch Spider-man model with a piece of dental floss isn't gonna cut it anymore. I'm amazed at what can be done in movies today and CG is the only way to achieve certain things. The characters were excellent, especially Tobey.  I had doubts about him playing such a physical character, but he really fit the role.  Kirsten did well with what she was given, but her character was the type who couldn't have saved herself from drowning in a puddle.  But this is comic book material and unfortunately, the women must be totally helpless.  Her character was the only one I didn't like.  Peter's aunt and uncle were very likeable, though.The story itself was very cool.  Not knowing a thing about Spider-man, it was great that I was able to understand the entire movie.  This is where it outshines Star Wars.  Anyone can watch 'Spider-man' and fall in love with it, whereas first-time Star Wars viewers will get almost nothing out of AOTC.  My only personal complaint of 'Spider-man' is that it has no repeat value, at least for me.  I saw it, liked it a lot, and that's it.  I've seen it once and that's all I need.  But fans will likely see it again and again with good reason.",1,5,12,23 May 2002
Spirited Away," My favorite Miyazaki film
","While I've only seen two other films penned by Hayao Miyazaki, 'Spirited Away' is my favorite of the three, by far.  What I like most about Studio Ghibli films is how realistic the characters are, in their movements and in their personalities.  Miyazaki's goal with 'Spirited Away' to show the emotional and social growth of a spoiled child by placing her in a frightening situation.  Chihiro, or Sen, is a sulky, self-centered girl who acts whiney and is hard to please.  Actually, I've seen worse kids, but in order to keep her character likeable, these traits weren't overblown.  Chihiro and her family are moving to a new home and she isn't too thrilled about it.  Her parents realize they've taken a wrong turn, so they immediately take a shortcut through the woods where they arrive at a mysterious place that looks like an abandoned park.  The parents want to go investigate, but Chihiro wants no part of it.  But fearful of the creepy surroundings, she follows them into a ghost town, where her parents discover a banquet of food and help themselves to it.  As Chihiro is walking around town, a strange boy called Haku approaches and warns her to leave immediately before the sun goes down, but it's too late.  Her parents have turned into pigs from eating the food and Chihiro is stuck in a spirit world to fend for herself, with some help from Haku.  That's just the beginning, as Chihiro and her parents have done a role reversal - it's now her turn to be an adult and save her family.  Haku tells her the only way she can save her parents is to get a job at the bathhouse, a place of leisure for gods.  From that point, we get to see the 'true' Chihiro, a girl who is courageous, loving and loyal.The characters drawn by Studio Ghibli may not be the most visually appealing of all anime, but the animation is always brilliant and very lifelike.  One of the best scenes is one where Chihiro is tying up her ponytail - the animation makes her look so real.  Yubaba, the owner of the bath house, and villain of the film, is a stunning character to look at, with lots of minute detailing.  Half the beauty of this film is in the artwork, it's eye candy overload and is extremely well done.  MINOR SPOILERS:  The other half of the film's beauty lies in its many messages and subtle symbolism.  All the characters bring a new theme to add to the pot.  Chihiro's parents are punished for their greediness and disrespect for others property, yet Chihiro learns from their mistake and when a similar opportunity arises later in the film, she knows what to do. The monster, No-Face, is the most mysterious character, as he represents a lonely outsider who seeks acceptance by indulging others.  Other themes/values covered include loyalty to your friends, putting aside your needs to help others, taking responsibility, confronting your fears, and forgiving your enemies.  It's a great film to learn from, but some of its messages might slip pass young kids.  I definitely recommend this film to everyone, especially teens and adults. Kids will likely be entranced by the trippy visuals and tense moments, but older viewers will appreciate the more complex elements.  Watch it a second time if possible, because it's very easy to miss something if your eyes aren't fixated on the screen.  When I realized what the film was really about, I enjoyed it much more the second time.  I regret that I've only seen the dubbed version, I usually like to see both versions.  The dub is very good, though, and the translation doesn't deviate too much from the original.I hear Mr. Miyazaki is working on another film and I hope the success of 'Spirited Away' and its much-deserved Academy Award will give future imported films a better chance to thrive in North America.  Hopefully, Disney has learned that the best animation doesn't have to come from Florida and will properly promote future Japanese-made films.  This one deserves all the acclaim its gotten.  I give it an 'A' for astounding.",Null,0,0,10 June 2003
Men in Black II," Dull and short, for die-hard fans only
","If you haven't seen the original MIB, I suggest watching it before seeing the sequel.  Otherwise, you probably won't get anything out of this one, like myself.  Will Smith is a funny guy and he's the only person keeping this film afloat.  'Men In Black II' is a weak hodgepodge of comedy, romance and sci-fi in which none of them stands out from the others.  It's basically a shoot-em-up alien movie with some decent special effects, but there's no heart at all.  Even during a sad scene at the end, I felt absolutely nothing.Surprisingly, the movie's rated PG-13, yet most of those laughing in the audience were kids under 10.  You know, the kind of kids who laugh at anything, even though they don't have a clue what the joke means.  The talking dog was the worst thing in the movie, but the little ones loved him. Putting that forsaken song 'Who Let The Dogs Out' in one of the scenes was the last nail in the coffin.If you're a MIB or Will Smith fan, you'll probably like this movie.  But the movie's extremely short length (it felt like an hour) and lack of any cohesiveness will bore most others.  In the end, the whole thing comes across as a money machine that will undoubtedly make millions it doesn't deserve.  Do yourself a favor and catch 'Star Wars' or 'Spider-Man' again before they're pulled from theaters.",3,0,0,1 July 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," Most heart-wrenching animated movie ever
","'Grave of the Fireflies' is such a masterpiece, it's impossible for me to do it justice here.  You just have to watch it.  If you thought 'Bambi' was sad, you'll be surprised with this movie.  The story is of two siblings, Seita and his little sister Setsuko, and how their lives were affected during WWII.  I think this movie will have a greater impact on younger viewers.  My father, whose own father fought in WWII, didn't care for the movie and didn't get the message it was trying to get across.  It doesn't focus on the war itself, but on two innocent children who are living in the midst of it.  This is a very tragic film, as the viewer will know from the beginning.  The movie begins by showing the childrens' demise; Seita has just died on the floor of a train station.  A worker spots his empty candy container and throws it outside, releasing Setsuko's ashes.  Her spirit appears and as she's about to run towards Seita's body, his own spirit joins her and the two are together again.  From there, the spirits lead us through a flashback of how they helped each other and later died.  It's like watching 'Titanic', you know the ship's going to sink, but we get to see the events leading up to it.  Don't pass up this gem just because it's animated.  Honestly, I forgot it was animated at times, the characters are so real and so is their story.  I don't think I'll ever see a more emotional, intelligent animated movie than this.  A must-see!",10,0,1,29 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," 'Harry Potter' is the 'Star Wars' of the new generation
","I just came back from seeing 'Chamber of Secrets' and I thought it was excellent.  Most of the flaws from 'Sorceror's Stone' have been fixed, particularly in the special effects dept.  The story is brilliant and it stays true to the book, yet works wonderfully on screen.  I believe that Harry Potter is THE fantasy series of the Millenial generation (kids under 20), the same way the Star Wars trilogy was for Gen X-ers.  That's not to say adults won't enjoy the film, because as a young 20-something, I am both a huge 'Star Wars' and Harry Potter fan.The 'Chamber of Secrets' is a much darker story that requires the viewer to pay attention to every detail.  Older kids and adults will most likely enjoy this film.  Reading the books isn't a requirement, so don't let that stop you from seeing the film if you aren't already a fan.  Since I read the book 3 years ago and forgot many details, I think I enjoyed the film more. Purists may be disappointed at certain omissions, but casual fans and newcomers with open minds should be very entertained.I'd definitely recommend seeing the first movie before this one, especially if you're new to the series.  Otherwise, you might have lots of 'what the heck?' moments.  This film delves deeper into the wizard world, with even stranger creatures and sinister plots involving elite wizards.  The first film was basically an introduction to the wizard world, following a very straight path through one school year.  The second is more story-oriented, jumping from event to event without a real sense of time.  We do get to see Christmas again, as a sort of benchmark.  This movie flows so well, that you won't believe you've been sitting in a seat for almost 3 hours; the time really flies.I won't go into story details, since you can read those anywhere, but I'll just make a few comments.  'Chamber of Secrets' is very Harry-centric, meaning the Harry, Ron and Hermione team of the first film is rather weak. Both kids take a backseat to Harry in this one.  It was comforting to see the old sub-characters again, especially the Gryffindor kids, but none of them contribute much.  Of the new characters, I thought Tom Riddle was the most fascinating.  Gilderoy Lockhart was a hit amongst both adults and kids in the audience.  I felt Ginny Weasley and Colin Creevey were the most neglected of the new cast, but that doesn't affect the film itself. Moaning Myrtle is annoying, but well played.  Dobby the elf was adorable, not looks-wise, but I couldn't help falling for the poor, little thing.As for scary content, there are a couple 'jump out of your seat' moments and a few tense moments that are amplified with very loud sound effects.  Like the first film (flying keys scene), the noise level is irritating at times, as I saw a few people put their hands over their ears.  The spider sequence isn't so bad, but younger kids might want to shield their eyes.  The battle with the chamber's monster at the end is probably the scariest scene for kids, it's reminiscent of any 'Jurassic Park' confrontation.  There were dozens of kids as young as 3 in the theater, and none of them seemed to have a problem.  From an adult's POV, I thought the baby mandrake scene was the most disturbing, if only a bit.A few more tiny things I'd like to mention:  The music is excellent, an overall better soundtrack than the first one.  The special effects were much improved, the only real hokey-looking one involved the flying car over the countryside.  The sets are gorgeous, I just loved seeing the Weasley house and the Chamber.  The best part of Harry Potter is that it's an enchanting, intelligent experience for people of all ages to enjoy.  I'd give the film a pretty solid 10/10.",10,0,0,17 November 2002
Signs," Wonderful movie, but not like I thought it would be
","I just saw 'Signs' a few hours ago.  My initial thought upon leaving the theater was 'It wasn't at all like I expected'.  I enjoyed 'Sixth Sense' immensely, but wasn't too thrilled with 'Unbreakable'.  Mr. Shyamalan's newest film is a lot like the first two, with the same symbolism and examination of human behavior.  This is what I love most about his films, you have to think to fully understand everything.  What might be hurting 'Signs' is that like 'Sixth Sense', it's being advertised as a scary alien movie.  If you go into the theater expecting 'jump out of your seats' thrills and chills, you might be disappointed. There a few tense moments, but I honestly wasn't scared; probably because I expected some really scary stuff.  The story mainly focuses on Graham Hess, played by Gibson, who was a minister of sorts before his wife died in a horrific accident.  He has since retired and winces when people address him as 'Father'.  He and his two children, along with his younger brother, Merrill, live on a rural farm in Pennsylvania.  One day, the children spot a 'crop circle' in the cornfields, which sets off a chain of events of what might be 'the end of the world'.
The story is VERY slow-paced, which may bore some viewers.  My father admits he almost fell asleep during the first half.  Key plot points are also very slow to develop, which might leave you thinking, 'What the heck is going on here?'  For instance, the fact that Graham's wife died in a car accident isn't entirely clear until the movie is half over.  At its heart, 'Signs' is a movie about a man's loss of faith, how it changed his life, and how rediscovering it has made him a better man.  This is accomplished by not being too preachy.  The whole deal with the aliens is more symbolic than anything, as if the message is 'If you don't have faith, you're all alone in the world with no one to save you.'  Without faith, the 'aliens' or inner demons of your own lack of faith and anger of the past will consume you. This is what Graham goes through in the first half of the movie, with the way he treats his kids along with his detached attitude.  We never really see what the aliens look like, they're usually seen from far away, or lurking in shadows.  But there is no need to see them, since they serve a more symbolic purpose.  Unfortunately, the whole thing was ruined at the end when the characters discover the aliens have a weakness to water.  It kind of cheapened the whole thing with faith being the number one weapon that I had imagined.The acting in the movie is excellent, except I noticed Mel Gibson needed only one facial expression to get through most of his scenes.  Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as Merrill, as were Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, who played Morgan and Bo, respectively.  My favorite scene, which was also one of the most moving, was when the family was eating their 'last meal' in which everyone got to eat whatever they wanted.  Graham's habit of hiding his feelings causes him to blow-up at his family, scaring the children who don't understand their dad's anger.  That was the tear-jerker in my opinion, and it marked a major change in Graham's character.  Also, Mr. Shyamalan continues with his tradition of acting in his films, this time as the man who killed Graham's wife in the accident.  Not the most flattering role, but it was well played.To summarize everything I've said, 'Signs' is a very deep, symbolic movie about the human spirit, with a few aliens thrown into the mix.  If you're going to see the movie for intense alien action, you'll probably be disappointed.  Young teens might also find the movie a bit dull.  I don't know what children might think, since I doubt many will be seeing this film, for good reason.  Not so much that the movie is scary, but it's too deep for kids.  I didn't understand everything myself, so seeing the movie a second time might be a good idea.  I'd give the movie an 8.5/10.",Null,0,1,19 August 2002
Donnie Darko," What an excellent trip!
","There are very few movies that have really gotten under my skin, stayed there for days, and inspired me to think further into the movie's concepts. I had no idea what kind of film this was going to be when I got the DVD.  By the looks of the cast, I thought I was in for a teen slasher flick.  The name 'Donnie Darko' didn't sound too hot, either.  I'm so glad I watched this film because it was much different than I thought it was going to be. Its intelligence rivals that of any sci-fi movie.  I guarantee most viewers will be thinking about this film for days after they've seen it.The title character, Donnie Darko, is a 15-year old living in a small town in 1987.  His parents have suspected he has mental problems and he is kept on some medication to help his problem with sleepwalking.  One night, he is summoned out of bed by a distant voice.  He follows it to a nearby golf course, where he meets a demonic-looking rabbit.  Soon after Donnie has left his house, a jet engine crashes into his home, leaving most of it intact except for Donnie's room.  Donnie had cheated death, but why? Why did this creepy rabbit get him out of bed?  And why are the townspeople acting so strange?  These are just a few of the questions you'll want answered. 
At it's core, the story is about time travel and parallel worlds, something that has always fascinated me.  Richard Kelly, the writer of this brilliant story, takes an old idea and turns it into something totally new.  I'm tempted to give more details, but I won't spoil the film here.The cast is full of big names, which is something I tend to cringe at, but the cast works so well in this film, that their starpower is barely noticeable.  This was the first time I've seen Jake Gyllenhaal in a film, and I was pretty impressed.  The acting all-around was very well done.  I especially liked Drew Barrymore in her small role as a schoolteacher. Patrick Swayze is excellent as a nutty self-help guru trying to spread his program throughout the town.  With such a small budget, this movie turned out better than most multi-million dollar productions.  This film is the ultimate display of love, from every department that went into making it.  Mr. Kelly has said that everyone worked for practically nothing, including hundreds of cast and crew.  Their dedication and care really shows in the final product and they all deserve to be commended for their effort.  Be prepared to watch this film more than once, because it will help greatly in understanding the story.  If you have the DVD, play the commentary with Richard Kelly and Jake when you watch that second time.  And after that, be sure to visit the 'Donnie Darko' website to gain some very important information on time travel and what happened to several of the characters. This film just might have taken 'The Sixth Sense''s spot on my top 10 list.  That said, this movie deserves a 10/10.",Null,0,0,25 January 2003
