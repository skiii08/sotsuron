Resident Evil: Afterlife," Plot was really good , production could have been better .
","I was really excited to watch the film , after having a mind blowing experience from Resident evil 1,2 and 3 . I must say Resident Evil Afterlife Disappointed me . Plot was good , acting was awesome but a great feeling behind it was that Director lost some quality in film trying to make it 3D . I watched it in 2D and my friends who watched it in 3D reviewed the film even worse , they want to watch it again in 2D .OVERALL REVIEW : Action movie fans sure must go and watch this film , but those going to have a great new experience , please think before you go .",6,3,8,13 September 2010
