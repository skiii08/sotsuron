Scarface," me, I always tell the truth, even when I lie
","i now gladly own the Blu-Ray which I received for Christmas, what can I say, this is a great movie and it's one of my favorite gangster flicks, it has everything you could ask for in a movie such as great performances (I couldn't picture anybody else playing tony Montana), hardcore action, great music (I love that they had classic rock and pop rock music), memorable moments, and perfectly timed funny moments, I like this movie better than the godfather trilogy, mainly because it's faster paced and has as mentioned perfectly timed funny moments, I like to have humor in my gangster flicks, that's just me, and don't get me wrong, I love the godfather trilogy, but I like this movie more. anyway, I highly recommend this to anyone who loves mob/gangster movies, they'll eat it up in a heart beat, I also recommend the self titled app and the Xbox game the world is yours, they're just as great :)",10,1,3,18 January 2014
Inglourious Basterds," stupidest war movie ever
","I hate this movie, the trailer made it look awesome, but then when I saw the movie, it ended up sucking, there was barely any action, it was PAINFULLY slow, it dragged A LOT, and i barely got to see the basterds, and most of the basterds end up getting wasted, inglourious basterds is an insult to the war genre, the title of best war movie ever belongs to 300: rise of an empire, the reason why I'm giving inglourious basterds one star is because of the AWESOME final shootout and the bloody flashback of Hugo stiglitz killing the Gestapo officers, those two scenes were my favorite, but other than that, inglourious basterds SUCKED, the only Tarantino films I like are kill bill part 1 and django unchained",1,2,6,2 December 2013
The Hunger Games," It should've been Rated R and a lot more violent
","if you read the source material, it's very violent, brutal, bloody, gory, and has nonstop action and mayhem once it gets going, the movie is the exact opposite, it's SEVERELY watered down, too tame, not violent enough, there's a severe lack of action, there's no suspense, and the shaky cam and cut aways EVERY FIVE SECONDS annoyed the ever loving crap out of me. I'm one of the many people that wishes this and the other three movies were Rated R and a lot more violent so they could REALLY show the terror of the games and how unpleasant panem really is.P.S. stick with battle royale 1 and 2 instead",1,10,12,22 August 2012
The Irishman," Totally Worth The Wait :)
","I've been binging the hell outta this one since I was so excited to see almost all the legends brought together when it first came out and I'm definitely gonna read the source material after I finish the Pierre hotel affair. I even watched this on the premiere day of the rise of skywalker to give that movie the double middle fingerPros (Tony Pros, Pun Intended lol)great lineup and performances from everybodyCons (Jimmy Conways, Pun Intended lol)I would've liked to see more of the legends and maybe some actors who have dabbled in the mob genre a few times but that just leaves you wanting more In a positive sense",10,1,5,19 March 2020
The Town," my favorite heist film :-)
","a long time pro thief tries to get out of the criminal business after one of his earlier heists goes wrong. I had saw a commercial of this movie in high school but I never watched it until 2013 on demand for free, and I'm sure glad I did :-), the town is an awesome heist film with nonstop action and suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat, along with a great performance from Jeremy Renner, don't get me wrong, everyone else's performances were great too but jeremy renner's was the best, jimmy coughlin was very reminiscent of tommy devito from goodfellas, a fast pace, really spot on Boston accents, and a sense of excitement, and even a bit of dry humor too. all in all, I highly recommend the town to anyone who loves heist/action films, they won't be disappointed :-). P.S. the last 11 and a half minutes are AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!",10,1,2,3 February 2015
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!!!!!!!!!, this is a fairy tale on crack lol
","15 years after their gingerbread house incident, hansel and gretel go all around the world doing one thing and one thing only, killin witches, AND MY GOD DOES IT DELIVER lol, this movie is basically punisher: war zone, the crow, machete 1 and 2, kill bill volume 1, splatterhouse, universal soldier 4, and crank 1 and 2 all rolled up into one, hansel and gretel: witch hunters is one of the goriest and most insane movie I've ever seen and i LOVE IT lol, it has tons of insane action and tons of VERY extreme gore, this is one of the best action movies out there. I easily recommend this movie to anyone who LOVES insane action and VERY extreme gore, they would REALLY enjoy it, 10/10, and just a reminder to those who want to see this movie, the last 11 and a half minutes is where it REALLY goes out of control lol, it is CRAZY at the end lol",10,0,2,10 October 2013
Frozen," this movie sucks balls
","this is the worst movie I had to sit through, I can't believe my mom made me sit through this since she said it was a so called family event, well I CALL BULLS***!!!!!!!!!!, I just absolutely hate musicals, except for repo: the genetic opera because that one had rock music, gore, dark humor, chicks, and vulgarity. I got really upset with my mom after she made me sit through this piece of s***, this piece of s*** was strictly meant for little kids and teenage girls obsessed with musicals and Disney, not for 21 year old guys like me who love action movies, horror movies, and adult cartoons. the only Disney movies I like are the pirates of the Caribbean series and maleficent, those are the only exceptions, I hate all other Disney movies, they're too Kiddish and crappy with WAY TOO MUCH SINGING!!!!!!!!!!",1,11,24,17 November 2014
Logan," Hugh Jackman Went Out With A Bang
","this is the uncaged, unchained, unleashed, borderline NC-17 wolverine film I've been waiting for, and then some because it basically had everything. they even did a really good job of faithfully adapting old man Logan, even without the characters that didn't make it in. it was also a mad max style western, the producers definitely weren't lying. there was nonstop action, tons of gore, a great story, great performances, drama, grit, emotional moments, well placed humor, and plenty of berserker rage (the scene at the end where Logan injects himself with the medicine, goes completely apeshit and starts slaughtering the soldiers in the forest one by one is quite honestly the most badass wolverine fight scene and display of berserker rage EVER). anyway, i was so freakin happy to finally see the REAL/SAVAGE wolverine on the big screen, this movie will definitely go into my blu-ray collection or be on my tablet after its theater run.",10,3,7,5 March 2017
Reservoir Dogs," worst heist movie EVER >:-(
","when I watched this on Netflix, I was waiting to see the jewelry store heist that went horribly wrong since that's what it was about, and come to find out, THEY DON'T EVEN SHOW IT!!!!!, how are you gonna call this a heist movie and not show the heist AT ALL?, that's just stupid, I freakin hate reservoir dogs, it's boring, it's painfully slow, and it drags A LOT, if you want to see an exciting and fast paced heist movie with nonstop action and suspense, check out these ones below1. The Town2. Firestorm3. Avenged4. Cradle 2 The Grave5. Roninp.s. Cradle 2 the grave is a heist movie, a rescue movie, and a martial arts movie",1,2,10,3 March 2014
Joker," All I have are positive reviews
","Just got back from seeing it 4 hours ago and it was as great as I thought it was gonna be, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fantastic (everyone else is great too but Joaquin commands the entire thing), the score and soundtrack were fantastic, the opening credits fit perfectly with the theme, and even the cinematography is great (this was a grimier, dirtier, and uglier Gotham City than what we're used to). it can easily pass as a scorsese flick since his fingerprints were left after leaving the producer's chair. I'm torn between which joker I like best between ledger and Phoenix, but I know that heath ledger would be very proud of Joaquin for pulling it off, give him ALL the oscars I say, he's earned them. but anyway, I recommend this to scorsese fans and joker fans alike. I definitely wanna see it again, maybe even buy the blu-ray. on a side note, for it being a slow burn, it's actually a slow burn done right like The Godfather",10,3,5,14 October 2019
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," will you follow me one last time?
","wow, just wow lol, this is easily better than the first two, oh my god, I almost flew out of my seat since there was so much crazy balls to the wall action, it was THAT good lol, this knocked the first two hobbits out of the ball park, it was just KARAZY, good lord lol, this is most definitely a must own for me when it comes to DVD and blu ray, I just HAVE to own this when it comes to DVD and blu ray lol, here's how I'd rank all the hobbit movies.the hobbit: an unexpected journey: 10/10- awesome the hobbit: the desolation of smaug: 10/10- just as good as the first one the hobbit: the battle of the five armies: 11/10- KARAZY lol",10,12,22,23 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," I already know they screwed this movie up, they sugar coated it by making it PG-13
","I already know they screwed this movie up, they sugar coated it by making it PG-13 and they probably took out the sin city feel to it that the book had, and they took out all the blood and gore and toned down the mayhem AGAIN, BAD MOVE >:-(. now I'm just hoping they won't screw up the third movie because the third book was INSANE and I expect the movie to be that way too. I hope the third movie will be INSANELY gory just like the book and I REALLY hope it will get an R Rating, both parts 1 and 2 since they split it in half, if they do screw up the third movie which i'm SERIOUSLY hoping they won't do, I am NOT going to be a happy camper AT ALL",1,59,119,2 December 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Assemble the kingsman
","A spy orginization recruits a young teenager into their ultra competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. first and foremost, I think this is better than the 007 series, this takes the spy genre, spins it on its head, goes completely nuts with it and says LET'S GO lol, and it doesn't tone anything down or hold back at all, it just goes full on crazy :-), and I liked how this was in the vein of kickass rather than 007. this movie was just absolute fun, if you loved the kickass series, you're gonna LOVE kingsman, it's loaded with really impressive action, blood and gore, and dry British humor that always makes you laugh out loud, and leave the kiddies at home for this one, this is for the adult crowd. I'm planning on seeing this again with my dad since he already wants to check it out lol",10,4,11,18 February 2015
