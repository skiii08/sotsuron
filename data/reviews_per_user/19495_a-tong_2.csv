Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Love it or hate it, Borat is a classic
","I loved it. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't seen comedy this corrosive since the days of Andy Kaufman. Borat is funnier, though, and more focused.Though some are offended, Borat holds a mirror to the darker face of America, which is homophobic, misogynistic and anti-Semitic. If you understand Borat's agenda, you'll appreciate this film. If you find what he does exploitive and mean, you'll despise it. Me, I think he makes his point about bigotry in an utterly original way -- and very funny.The word 'classic' is abused and overused when it comes to movies, but it applies in this case. BORAT will be around for a long, long time.",10,0,13,18 December 2006
The Departed," Pales next to the Hong Kong original
","THE DEPARTED is Scorsese's eagerly anticipated remake of the smash Hong Kong thriller, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, which captivated much of Asia and spawned two sequels across the Pacific. The casting of Nicholson, De Caprio et al looked promising.While there are some entertaining moments in DEPARTED and the film is enjoyable, it falls far short of INFERNAL AFFAIRS. Ironcally, IA feels more like a Scorsese film than DEPARTED: fast-cutting, a rock soundtrack, sharp camera moves and action jacked-up to 11. DEPARTED is inconsistent. At two-and-a-half hours, it moves, slows down, rocks, stops, goes forward, pauses.There's also a little too much posturing among all these cops and villains and not enough suspense which accelerated INFERNAL AFFAIRS like a rocket ship hurling into space. The central cat-and-mouse premise between the two moles is strangely muted in DEPARTED and that's what hurts the film the most.Performances are fine, starting with a salty Nicholson. I love Scorsese, but his hallmarks of slick camera moves, swift editing and the perfect soundtrack don't hit the mark.Not bad, but certainly not vintage Marty.",6,18,56,5 October 2006
