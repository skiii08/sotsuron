Source Code," Read after watching the movie
","Hey, this is the first time for me to write something but I just watched a movie called Source code this movie made me have a little thought with myself about what Kalter Stevens did and how he entered the last 8 minutes of another life of Seon that made me think how this man used the repeatedly 8 minutes and what about us do we deserve that he repeated the 8 minutes till he realized their value if you watch carefully how the man used the last 8 minutes you will know what is the real value of time, he thought that these minutes was the last of his whole life that what made him enjoy every and each second with doing the right thing, save the world, having the girl, but we have to think of something that he have to live his life as another one who called Seon so I have been thinking do I need to change my whole body to become a new man or have such a miracle to put my soul into another body who is well build and knows a girl a beautiful girl that made you look to her face and eyes when she smiles makes your eyes won't even blink (they really know how to choose women in movies), what made me amazed is that the guy got another life for his soul after he finished his own physically, after this movie you say that that guy gone to heaven by this source code, So give yourself 5 minutes to think and evaluate what could happen when we leave our body, we will not go to another body, that is it, we will be held accountable for what we done in our life, at that time you will think that you only lived for a day or two or in this case 8 minutes so the point is how this movie will affect you! will you just go on whatever you are doing or you will have a little thought to ask yourself .. How am I doing ?",10,1,3,13 December 2011
