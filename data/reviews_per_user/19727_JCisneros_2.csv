Scarface," Al Pacino's greatest role
","I will only say one thing about this masterpiece: Al Pacino has said that this movie was his greatest role, and should have won the Oscar for it. (Before Scent of a Woman). A truly spectacular Saga.",10,0,0,24 January 1999
Titanic," Shows you what 200+ million will get you in the movie business
","While Titanic is not a horrible movie, it really has no merit to be dubbed 'the greatest movie ever.' The love story is wishy washy, the action sequences are mediocre, and to really believe that a homeless man can get a woman from an aristocratic dynasty is frankly, just laughable. Aside from all that, the computer graphics were ok, given the 200+ million dollar budget.I just don't get it. John Carpenter can make a cult classic like Assault on Precinct 13, or Halloween for a mere 100 thousand dollar budget. If you care to make the argument that 'well, that was in the 1970's,' well you're wrong. Take for instance, Richard Rodriguez'  1993 hit El Mariachi. He made the movie for a mere 25 thousand dollars, and went on to earn more than 20 million. What I am afraid of is the sort of dismembering of the real creativity of writing, story, script, plot, acting, directing, that really make watching movies enjoyable. If you wish to add to the overblown hype to this mediocre trillion dollar production, shell out your hard earned dollars and buy the video, buy the soundtrack, buy the laserdisc, DVD, and rent it.",5,2,3,23 January 1999
