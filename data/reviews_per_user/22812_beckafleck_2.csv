Walk the Line," Fantastick
","Oh my goodness...this was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not only was it great, but it was well acted too. Joaquin was superb. I have come to expect great things from him. He hit Johnny Cash dead on. WOW!!! Reese...what can I say...another WOW. I was more amazed by her. I love her to pieces and think she is wonderful, but I always see her in the cute little romantic comedies. Seeing her in something like this really shows her versatility. She was awesome. Not to mention the fact that they both(more Joaquin than Reese) had to learn how to sing and play instruments. They both did an amazing job. I was also impressed that it did so well against Harry Potter. Good Job!! I think this is going to be the movie(and actors) to beat come Oscar time.",10,2,5,21 November 2005
Wedding Crashers," Wow
","I think all I need to say here is Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. If you need elaboration here goes. Separately they are two of the funniest guys around. Get them together and you're in for something special. There were a couple parts that were a little raunchy, but you almost didn't even care. It was delivered so well, that it went from raunchy to just plain funny. Of course the rest of the cast was great too. Rachel McAdams is fantastic, and Christopher Walken is equally as funny. I think my favorite person in this movie is Isla Fisher. She was the funniest thing I have seen in a long time. She did a phenomenal job. I laughed for pretty much the whole movie. I would definitely recommend this movie.",10,0,3,9 August 2005
