3:10 to Yuma," confusing western
","I enjoyed this movie up until the part where the great Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) had a change of mind, helping his own capture by being shot at and jumping over roofs to get to the Yuma train. I also didn't understand why Crowe's character would kill his entire crew who risked their lives to be loyal to their boss. I understand that Crowe's character might have taken a liken to the brave and crippled Dan Evans (Christian Bale), but what did he expect was going to happen to Evans when everyone in the entire town were shooting at the two of them. I was relieved when Evans' young son decided not to shoot Ben Wade...it showed he would eventually become the bigger man.",5,3,6,22 February 2008
Juno," 16 year old girl learns she's emotionally immature and not ready to be a good parent
","I needed a light-hearted movie to see so I picked this one. The music soundtrack was great! Also, I thought the movie did a good job in showing another side of a 16-yr. old girl getting pregnant...that it really is a lot to handle emotionally, even if you're physically ready to have a baby. As a 16 yr. old, you are inexperienced in knowing who you are and what people insinuate from your actions. Ellen Page was fresh and I enjoyed watching her on screen. The script was hilarious! Diablo Cody was great in thinking up of a story that has been told a thousand times (young girl getting pregnant, too young to raise baby), but she twisted the story from a humorous viewpoint that was very enjoyable and different to watch on screen!",8,3,8,13 February 2008
