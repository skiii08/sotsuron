Blade Runner 2049," Biggest waste of 3 hours
","Ryan Gosling is a terrible drama actor. He is good is comedy though. Movie is painfully slow, a lot of idiotic things happen without explanation. Why do robots drown??? Why do they feel pain???The cinematography is good, but not in any way related to what is going on in the story line.",1,2,5,27 December 2017
