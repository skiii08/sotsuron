The Blair Witch Project," A great idea isn't always a great film
","Wow-what a great idea for a movie.Even if the ad campaign's suggestion that this was a true story was terribly transparent, it was still an exciting concept.  It could have been a great film, too.Instead of making the most of the idea, there's far too much time spent on the extremely un-sympathetic characters arguing with each other.  I suppose this is meant to show their dawning fear and justify the incredibly stupid things they wind up doing (like not walking out of the woods...duh). Instead of being scary, the movie is merely annoying for too many long spells.",6,0,2,19 October 1999
American Beauty," A fine film, but don't look to closely
","This is an intelligent film that is immaculately acted and brilliantly shot. I concur with the other reviewers who loved it, but I was also put off by the heavy-handed Message with a capital 'M' that was being hammered into the viewer.  Every scene has a pretty obvious Purpose to set up something that will obviously occur later.  Finally, to pick nits, it wasn't nearly as mean as it could, and probably should, have been.  Better than 95% of what is out there, but not as good as it wanted to be.",8,0,0,27 September 1999
Event Horizon," In an empty theater, no one can hear you scream...
","I actually yelled at the screen in this film.  Really.  When the big 'secret' of the Event Horizon was revealed, it was so insultingly stupid that I couldn't believe the filmaker had the nerve to toss it up there on the screen.The film looks pretty cool-the interiors of the spaceship were based on a cathedral, but other than that, there's really nothing to suggest it.",1,39,77,19 October 1999
