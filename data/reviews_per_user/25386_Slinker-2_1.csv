The Blair Witch Project," 'Scary as hell' does not do this movie justice.
","I recently had a chance to see an advanced screening of The Blair Witch Project. When I sat down to watch the movie, I did not know what to expect, because I had not heard about the movie before. What I got myself into was more than I could swallow. I frequently had to put my head between my legs to hide myself from the chilling reality that it showed... it was not a movie, it was an experience. I would recommend it to anyone. Just make sure you bring someone with you to hold your hand.",10,1,2,15 May 1999
