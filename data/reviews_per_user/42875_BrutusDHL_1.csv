The New World," Worst movie ever!
","This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. 1 hour into the movie I was still asking myself why I went to see this piece of crap, knowing that the director was involved in the farce 'The thin red line'.This movie is over two hours long, but that does not mean you are getting two hours of content. It seems that content, dialogue, cinematography, you know, the stuff that makes a movie, decided to take some time off during this crap fest. How long DOES one need to linger on the significance of somebody learning how to say 'Sky' in English? It felt like 20 minutes, and it might have been, since all the scenes were dragged out ten minutes past pain.The director should be banned from having any film that he is involved with from showing in the United States. It should be considered a hate crime against anyone that loves, hell, remotely enjoys movies.Please do yourself a favor and do not see this movie.",1,2,9,1 February 2006
