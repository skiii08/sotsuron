The Rock," The apex of the Bruckheimer action pic
","If 'Top Gun' is the film that defined the Bruckheimer formula, 'The Rock' is the movie that uses all the elements to best effect, before things got too out-of-hand (and too loud!) with Armageddon (and don't ask me what happened with Pearl Harbour...). Everything is there - slow-mo shots of people looking heroic, wailing guitars, big explosions, seemingly impossible task.For an action film, all the main characters are surprisingly well developed, and none of the actors waste the opportunity. Ed Harris is the perfect choice to play the fallen hero baddie, and it was an inspired move to cast Sean Connery as basically an aged James Bond - he seems to enjoy himself too. But the film belongs to Nic Cage, who not only delivers more hilarious lines than i can count, but also comes across as a likable, believable character. The interactions between him and Connery are better than can be found in 99% of 'buddy movies'.The balance between tension and all-out action is about right, and both are well executed. The chase through San Francisco deserves special mention.Personally, i marginally prefer 'Top Gun', but that's in a kind of semi-ironic way, since it's so cheesy. The Rock is an action film i'm not ashamed to say i like.",8,4,6,24 March 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," another nail in the franchise's coffin
","OK, so the matrix was great - there's no doubt about it. The look of the whole film was cutting edge, it presented action scenes the like of which had never been seen before, and the plot - if not as 'deep' as some might suggest, was at least coherent, and held the attention for the whole film.The Matrix reloaded ranks as one of the biggest disappointments in my movie-going life. Not only was it completely unnecessary, it was boring beyond belief and even the (admittedly spectacular) freeway scene couldn't relieve the embarrassment of the 'rave' scene and superfluous religious imagery.The Matrix revolutions may or may not be worse than 'reloaded' - it's hard to tell since my expectations were so much lower. What is for certain though, is that it is a bad film. It still takes itself way too seriously, still alternates incongruously between tedious pseudo-philosophising and implausible action sequences that go on so long they themselves become tedious.And it's so stoopid! - OK so here's the possible spoiler - at the end when Neo makes a deal with the machines, WHY would the machines keep their part of the bargain? They're machines! If they were programmed in the first place with some sense of honour, why weren't they programmed not to want to take over the world?If you've seen the matrix but not it's sequels - don't! If you have seen the sequels, just try not to associate them with the original - no point in tainting the memory of an outstanding film..",4,1,4,10 March 2005
Gladiator," Padded out to make it feel more 'epic'
","Gladiator is a long film. Epic films are supposed to be long. But somehow Gladiator doesn't feel like an epic film. Sure, it deals with the rise and fall of a Roman Emperor, has spectacular battle scenes, a nearly spectacular CGI Colosseum, and everyone speaks in the clipped 'BBC English' accent that we all know they used in Roman times, but somehow the story doesn't carry enough weight.We feel bad for Maximus when he's betrayed, and we hate the villain and want him to get his comeuppance. But we don't give a toss about the Roman people, who are portrayed as a bloodthirsty mob, so why should we want them to be freed from their tyrannical emperor? It works better as a personal revenge tale than as a chapter in the history of the Roman Empire.The script is weighed down with pretentious and meaningless pronouncements ('Rome is an idea'?) and the plot is too full of coincidences. The action sequences are well executed (if you'll excuse the pun) and none of the actors embarrass themselves, but overall this is an above average film that has ideas above its station.",7,1,2,21 March 2005
