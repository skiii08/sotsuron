Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Not as good as I was hoping it would be
","I read the book and enjoyed it so I had high hopes for this movie. I thought the premise was clever and fairly original and if had been handled correctly it could have been so much more than it was.Unfortunately, I found the movie to be adequate but nothing special. I thought the actors did a good job with what they had to work with but there was just something lacking. I saw this in 3D and I very quickly got tired of all the sparkly little dust motes and bits of pollen that were floating through the air in virtually every scene, not to mention the copious amounts of blood splatter. I know, I know, its a vampire flick, of course there's going to be blood splatter. But when it's used as much as it was in this movie, it loses its impact. A little would have gone a long way.",5,0,1,28 November 2012
Wind River," Taylor Sheridan has done it again
","I was lucky enough to see this at the Nantucket Film Festival back in June and I thought it was excellent. And based on the response of the people around me in the packed theater, I wasn't the only one. The applause at the end was loud and long. The movie ended up coming in second at the festival, right behind behind The Big Sick.I enjoyed it as much as, if not more than, Hell or High Water. Definitely more than Sicario.The scenery, the score, the dialogue and the acting were all on point. Some of Jeremy Renner's best work. He's been spending so much time playing spy and superhero lately that I think people tend to forget that he was nominated for Hurt Locker and The Town. His performance here is even better.",10,174,233,23 June 2017
Knives Out," I really enjoyed this.
","I thought it was clever and well done with some good bits of black humor. Right up my alley. The acting was great and I really enjoyed it. Even knowing that pretty much anything was a potential clue, the scene at the end with the knife still surprised me.Random side note: Parts of the movie were filmed in the town where I work so it was fun spotting familiar streets and shops. And the bar where I have attended many trivia nights also made an appearance.",8,6,15,28 November 2019
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Bloody, dark, tongue in cheek fun!
","I wasn't expecting anything deep or insightful or thought provoking when I went to see this. I was expecting a fantasy/horror movie with dark humor where I could turn off my brain and just enjoy the ride and that was pretty much what I got. I really enjoyed it. It was fun and funny and it was fairly obvious that their tongues were firmly in their cheeks when they made this. I enjoyed the 'Middle Ages meets Steampunk' aspect and thought it was a nice touch that Hansel actually developed the sugar sickness - a.k.a. diabetes - from being forced to eat all that candy as a kid.I enjoyed the brother/sister vibe between the two. You don't see a great many brother/sister action duos. At least, none come immediately to mind. It's always buddies/cops or soldiers and if there is a male/female pairing it's usually romantic. To have the protagonists be siblings was a refreshing twist. They both knew the other could take care of themselves but were still protective and concerned for each other.And as for taking care of themselves, hunting witches was never shown as easy. They each got their asses handed to them on numerous occasions and in the scene where we see Hansel shirtless, his body is covered in scars, both old and new.The only complaint I have is that it wasn't long enough. It's run time is just short of 90 minutes so they had ample room to expand a few scenes - or even add new ones - to flesh out the character development a little.",9,67,99,26 January 2013
The Bourne Legacy," I liked it.
","It had a few flaws but overall, I liked it. I think Jeremy Renner has a really marvelous ability to blend toughness and vulnerability in a way that a great many actors don't. As such, I actually found Aaron Cross to be far more relate-able than Jason Bourne. He projected this undercurrent of quiet panic throughout the entire movie at the very idea that he would revert back to his former self – a poor man's Forrest Gump, as it were – and I found that to be both intriguing and sympathetic. He didn't want to go back to what he'd been, and with very good reason. Another thing I liked was how Aaron wasn't the one to survive because he was somehow better than the other agents but because he got lucky.Edited to add:I saw this for a second time and, as a result,felt the need to come and post a few more thoughts/comments. I've never been much of a Matt Damon fan, so I didn't miss him at all, and as stated above, I found that Aaron came across as more relate-able. Jason Bourne was a blank slate the way Matt portrayed him, so while I enjoyed the other movies, it was largely in spite of Damon rather than because of him. I'd be okay with never seeing Jason Bourne in any future films, though they can reference him all they want. So Matt, please be sure to keep your word! Jeremy was damn good, and I am pleased he's becoming more high profile. And yes, he was HOT in this movie.Shame that the film is getting negative reviews, but not that surprising. These movies put Matt Damon on the map, so anyone invested in his involvement would be a hard sell. I also thought that Rachel and Jeremy were extremely convincing with their deep connection in a short amount of time. Often, I roll my eyes at such developments, and never really bought Jason and Marie's love story. Yet, I found myself invested in Aaron and Marta. Rachel Weisz always manages to convey an inner strength in her roles while being vulnerable. Given the saturation of the physically kickass woman in movies these days, it's refreshing to see more of a balance in a female character (in an action film). Though her final actions on the motorcycle were pretty badass.All that said, the movie did end abruptly, and left me wanting more and I very much hope that we get it.",9,6,13,16 August 2012
La La Land," I enjoyed it but ...
","Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this. That being said, I didn't think it was quite the level of 'OMG, this was awesome!' raves that it's been getting. I can't help but think that half the reason this is getting such critical acclaim is because it's set in Hollywood and is about Hollywood. If these characters had been some something other than a struggling actress and musician and it was set in another city, it wouldn't be doing as well. If the critics and AMPAS people didn't identify with it as much as they do, would they still love it?",7,1,5,2 January 2017
