The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockinjay Part 1 is an intriguing depiction of the novel it is however not as good as either of the previous installments
","As I have read all three books and have now seen all the released movies I can safely say that I do believe that the Hunger Games franchise is in safe hands. For both people who have read the books or who have only seen the films I think they will be satisfied. I was sceptical at first whilst going into the movie and yet I was intrigued to see how the narrative would play out on screen. I personally felt that the third book in the Hunger Games Trilogy 'Mockingjay' was the most monotonous and disengaging out of the lot, so when I heard that Lionsgate was going to split the novel into two I like most people thought it was a heartless cash grab that would not pay off. Mockingjay Part 1 is by no means better than the other two previous instalments of the series but it is not however a bad film contradictory of some of the other more naÃ¯ve reviews. It serves (as I had hoped) as an engaging build up for the final chapter in the Hunger Games cinematic series. Although I still think that it was not right to split Mockingjay up, the first part has proved to be better than I thought and I walked out of the cinema feeling exited for the finale. For people who have not read the books and have only watched the 'Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' I have to mention that the movie is a complete deviation from the practically identical structure of the other two films. Mockingjay Part 1 delves deeper as you might expect into the intricacies of building a revolution against the capitol. If you enjoyed the two movies purely for the spectacle of the arena and the survival element of the plot you will not like this movie but if you are invested in the acting talents of this series you are more likely to see this movie as an enjoyable cinematic experience. For people who have read the book I will say that Mockingjay Part 1 is a pleasant surprise. I thought like the book the film would be dull and slow paced. The first two thirds of this film are worth your time even if the final part felt a little stretched. All of the Mockingjay book by Suzanne Collins was a disappointment for me but I think the plot has been rectified and showcased properly in this film. The film unlike the book expands on Collin's world, in a subtle way and gives you more of an insight into the establishment of opposing propaganda clips which I found thoroughly entertaining and interesting (this was not depicted so much in the book). I would have given this film a 5 instead of a 7 if it was not for the superb talents of Jennifer Lawrence & the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Their performances arguably carry the story and do not falter throughout the duration of the movie. Hoffman's intellectual and shockingly comedic portrayal of Plutarch Heavensbee is yet another reminder of what a great character actor who we have lost and who will miss in the foreseeable future. This movie includes a solid soundtrack and outstandingly realistic special effects. If you have enjoyed the acting and the characters you will like this movie. If you didn't like Mockingjay the book try out this feature because it may as I found surpass your expectations. This movie has at the very least made me want to rush to see the final film which I suppose was its primary function as a studio cash grab. Even now I think that this time next year when the final movie of the Hunger Games has come and gone I may even be a little upset when I come to realize that it is all over.",7,0,7,7 January 2015
