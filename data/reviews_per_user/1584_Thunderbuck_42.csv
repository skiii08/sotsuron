The King's Speech," Brilliant and surprisingly entertaining
","For once, you can believe the critical buzz and put your money down at a real theatre. Is 'The King's Speech' a masterful, well-acted period piece about King George VI and the friendship he builds with his speech pathologist? Sure. And for many, that's going to get in the way.Period films about British royalty don't appeal to everyone, and that's a crying shame in this case. David Seidler's script is surprisingly witty and insightful; the warmth and good humour of this movie are infectious.Colin Firth's performance is fantastic, and not just because of the speech impediment he adopts in his portrayal of Prince Albert. The warmth, dignity, and vulnerability are all evident and believable.The Brits in particular seem to have a knack for producing quiet, smart little movies that wind up staying with you for years. This is definitely one of them.",10,2,7,9 February 2011
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Improbably great
","...and I don't say 'great' lightly. This isn't merely some tired road comedy in drag, it's a fun, at times surprisingly moving story.Part of my immense surprise comes because I'd never really understood the appeal of drag shows. While I'm not sure I'm any bigger a fan, I definitely found myself drawn into the little universe created here.The central characters are real people who manage to play to stereotypes without succumbing to them. I was frankly amazed by Terence Stamp, an actor who has made a career playing dangerous, macho types, and made a surprisingly compelling and believable ageing transsexual. The novelty quickly wore off; it was one of those rare performances that was just totally without affect. Honestly, one of the best performances I've ever seen.Fun, as I expected, but there's a genuine affection and depth here. A very pleasant surprise.",9,10,13,5 July 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," A marvelous, charming world
","Miyazaki builds these wonderful little universes. Poetic, charming places that are at once familiar and exotic. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely bit of film that provides a great little escape.Miyazaki is clearly a master storyteller, because it's only after viewing this film that I realized there isn't really much 'story' here, and what there is has many inconsistencies and unexplained twists. The ending, in particular, seems to just 'happen'. But, frankly, the characters are so involving, and the movie is so beautifully drawn, that any story shortcomings are easy to overlook.I know some are wary of the 'Disneyfication' of films like this or SPIRITED AWAY. I think this is something of a labor of love, though, and is motivated less by greed than a sincere desire to bring these beautiful films to a wider audience. Certainly the talent isn't lacking in this English language translation, with great vocals from Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and the incomparable Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is quite funny as Calcifer, the fire demon, too.While I think I preferred SPIRITED AWAY on the whole, it's really just a few minor quibbles that lead me to this. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely place to visit for a couple of hours.",9,4,6,15 July 2007
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Nothing earth-shattering, but cute
","'Crazy Stupid Love' is nice. Possibly the perfect date movie, since it explores relationship pitfalls without getting lost in them.Nice performances. Ryan Gosling plays a great 'player' who decides to take Steve Carrell's character Cal under his wing and help him learn to talk to women about something other than his failed marriage. And Emma Stone is her usual delightful self.Entertaining, funny, and occasionally poignant. Frankly, the level of insight isn't much greater than some sitcoms, but it's still sweet.Dating? Or, married and on a 'date night'? Worth a trip to the theater. Otherwise, perfectly worthwhile as a rental later on.",8,0,1,18 September 2011
Finding Nemo," Another Pixar triumph!
","This might be my most anticipated new film in ages.  After being mightily impressed by Monsters Inc both as a technical exercise and as a piece of outstanding storytelling, I realized that Pixar is on a major roll, and has yet to produce a dud.In fact, ALL of Pixar's films have raised the bar both in computer animation AND in family movies.While FINDING NEMO doesn't quite reach the heights that MONSTERS INC. did, it's still a very impressive and entertaining film in its own right, and certainly meets the calibre of Pixar's other movies.Let's get the one weakness out of the way; after creating a story with a very convincing central relationship in Monsters Inc between Sully and 'Boo', the characters in FN aren't quite as well-drawn.  Not that they're bad, and not that there aren't some great moments, but I don't think we get to care about these guys quite as much as the denizens of Monstropolis.As for the strengths, they're here in abundance.  The first is the dazzling animation.  Set almost entirely in the ocean, FN displays incredibly real creatures, backdrops, and aquatic textures.  It's lovely, and very easy to 'immerse' one's self in (pardon the pun).  There are also the typical fantastic Pixar characters like Bruce the shark and Gil.Everything Pixar has done has been an 'instant classic', to march out that hoary old cliche.  The reason they've been able to achieve this so consistantly is because they've never lost sight of how important STORY is; the technology has always existed in Pixar films to support the story, and never the other way around.  FINDING NEMO is no exception.",9,0,0,17 June 2003
Hot Fuzz," VERY, very funny
","HOT FUZZ is a very funny movie, but it works by (mostly) playing it straight. In fact, for the first half of the movie, Simon Pegg makes a fairly credible action hero.I don't know that I'd call HOT FUZZ a send-up, or a parody, because it does play so straight. I'd call it more of a highly-skewed homage. The plot is negligible, though I've seen worse in mainstream action flicks. The lines are delivered with the same kind of earnest weight you'd see in any number of cop-buddy movies.The story bogs down for a while in the middle, but that's because it's setting up for the climax. The last 45 minutes of HOT FUZZ is the most brilliant, sustained piece of comedy I can remember.Yes, it's funnier than SHAUN OF THE DEAD, and probably anything else you're likely to see this year. TOTALLY worth a theatre viewing.",9,0,0,16 May 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," Ah, back to those thrilling days of...
","...the 1970s, when we saw such big-budget blockbuster disaster movies as 'Earthquake' (in SENSURROUND!) and Irwin Allen's 'The Poseidon Adventure' and 'The Towering Inferno'.  I have to admit, I loved these movies as a kid, though 'Poseidon' is likely the only one that even remotely holds up.Even so, when I saw the ads for 'The Day After Tomorrow', I felt a long-forgotten chill of excitement run through me.  The disaster movie is BACK, baby!This is not really a very good movie, but I liked it anyway, and give it a marginal recommendation.  The script is cliched (right down to the 'we have to do something before it's too late!' dialogue), parts of the story downright asinine (you just KNEW those wolves were going to show up at an inconvenient time), but the effects were incredible, and some of the story lines turned out to be fairly interesting.  That I've always liked Dennis Quaid, and I'm happy to see him find work, only adds to my enjoyment.Normally, I'd say wait for video.  However, some of the disaster sequences are utterly spectacular and truly demand big-screen viewing.  In particular, the scene where the tidal wave first washes around the Statue of Liberty and into Manhattan is breathtaking.By the way, as silly as much of this is, there are a few grains of intelligence behind this story.  I doubt the science is meant to be taken seriously at all, but the film does leave us with the message that if we continue to abuse the environment, it may turn on us in drastic and unexpected ways.  And I liked the irony that Americans are forced to flee south to Mexico, suggesting that perhaps it's worth improving relations with the developing world because we never know when we'll need them...Call it 7/10, for spectacular special effects and some nostalgia.",Null,0,0,7 June 2004
Crash," Magnificent and inevitable
","Watching Paul Haggis' CRASH brings to mind Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS, and Lawrence Kasdan's GRAND CANYON. Haggis manages to do them both one better.With only a little contrivance, Haggis manages to convey the interconnectedness that Altman's film vainly tried to portray, and at the same time he manages to cut Kasdan's film to pieces as naive fantasy.CRASH is a marvellously ironic, shades-of-gray masterpiece. Nobody gets through unscathed, and yet all are sympathetic to some degree. This is an unusually intelligent Hollywood movie, and definitely worth a watch.",10,7,15,11 September 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Brutal... magical... powerful
","When I went to rent this film the clerk was sure to advise me: 'You know this is Spanish with English subtitles, right?' I told her I already knew that. 'Okay, just that I've had some people return it.' So there's my first piece of advice for watching this movie; yes, it's subtitled. You're going to have to actually read the dialogue.Second piece of advice: don't equate 'fantasy' with 'suitable for children' and ignore this film's R rating. It earns that rating honestly with some VERY graphic violence.Given those two caveats, PAN'S LABYRINTH is a spectacularly original, heartbreakingly beautiful movie. There's a temptation to veer into movie-geek talk about how it speaks 'to the human condition' and how it 'demonstrates the triumph of imagination over pain', but I'd rather comment on how it just makes a fantastic, entertaining story.This movie is just as much thriller as it is fantasy as it is tear-jerker. The power of PAN'S LABYRINTH is that its characters are at once familiar and well-drawn.The film occupies two worlds: a remote army encampment in Fascist 1944 Spain and the magical second-life of pre-teen Ofelia, the stepdaughter of the camp's captain. Neither of these worlds is presented with any compromise. The Captain (Sergi López) is clearly brutal and not-so-clearly insecure, constantly aware of the memory of his father, a General killed in battle.Ofelia's (Ivana Baquero) escape from her hated stepfather is a world of faeries and fauns, rendered seamlessly. This is as beautiful an application of digital effects as I've seen in any film. The creatures are original--at times terrifying--and constantly amazing.A word on the violence of this movie. It is absolutely necessary to the story, and the film's emotional power would have been diluted without it. I would not show this movie to my children, but as an adult I appreciate Del Toro's trust in his audience. PAN'S LABYRINTH is my new prime example of how graphic violence CAN serve a story.Yes, PAN'S LABYRINTH is brutally violent, and, yes, it is subtitled. Given those conditions, I recommend it highly. If you watch only one 'foreign' film in your life, make it this one.",10,3,6,20 May 2007
Knocked Up," Grown-up Fun
","Don't know if it was brilliant, exactly, but KNOCKED UP worked. At least for the most part. Judd Apatow once again does a good job of framing scenes that come off with almost an improvisational quality, and the first half-hour of this movie has some great laughs (my personal opinion of Ryan Seacrest has improved considerably).It isn't great. This feels more like a collection of related skits than an actual story, but since some of these 'skits' manage to be either funny, touching, or otherwise entertaining, it's okay. But in a comedy that comes out to more than 2 hours (on DVD), it does seem to get a little long, after a while.This is a rude, crude movie for adults, though there are some pretty good messages about responsibility and the challenges people face as they start a family (particluarly an unplanned one), and I (personally) would probably let high-school-age kids see it.",7,0,1,29 September 2007
Megamind," It's...okay
","Megamind is actually kind of a neat idea, and might even be taken as a contemplation on the nature of good and evil ('can there BE evil without good?'), but it's a victim of its own timidity.The great cast is pretty much wasted here. Will Farrell shows uncharacteristic restraint in the way he voices Megamind, and while Tina Fey, David Cross, and Jonah Hill are all very funny people, the script doesn't give any of them much to work with.The funniest scene is probably the one where Fey's Roxanne has been kidnapped by Megamind, who eagerly anticipates Metroman's rescue effort. Except Megamind has done this so many times that Roxanne is not only not afraid, she's actually bored, and challenges Megamind to be more original. It's cute. The trouble is, this is an early scene, and nothing in the rest of the movie really gets back to this level. The other BIG problem is that the best gags from even THIS scene were used in promos for the movie.Yes, there's an irresistible urge to draw comparisons. I spent much of my time watching this movie lamenting on how good Pixar's The Incredibles is. And, yes, a comparison is valid, considering that the story in The Incredibles covers a lot of the same territory. I felt remarkably similar feelings about Sony's Despicable Me, too, but part way through that movie at least took an odd turn into improbable family comedy and actually went somewhere.Perhaps most unfortunately, I'd just seen How To Train Your Dragon earlier that day on DVD, and Megamind seemed phoned-in by comparison.Dreamworks can do better, and has, many times.",6,2,7,8 November 2010
Horrible Bosses," Yes, another VERY adult comedy...
","...and maybe not outstandingly memorable, but completely worthwhile.The movie's a little scatter-shot. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as Jason Bateman's psychotically-narcissistic boss, but his character is pretty much recycled from any number of other Kevin Spacey movies.Even so, most of the gags work very well (I was especially amused by how unsympathetic Charlie Day's friends were as he described the sexual harassment his boss was wreaking on him). There are some very funny farcical set-pieces.Don't know if Jennifer Aniston went outside her 'comfort zone', exactly, though her character was a lot raunchier than what her 'Friends' fans might expect. She likely had tons of fun doing this movie; the rest of the cast certainly seemed to.It's a grown-up movie that earns that R-rating with graphic language and some significant drug references.Comparisons? Almost as funny as 'Bridesmaids' (though not as strong a story). Definitely worth seeing in a theatre.",Null,1,2,12 July 2011
The Best Years of Our Lives," 'Greatest Generation', indeed
","I remember seeing this movie perhaps a couple of decades ago and marveling that a movie with such honest, realistic characters was made in 1946. I made a point of viewing it again recently to see if my first impression held up.The bad news is that the actual plot of BEST YEARS veers a bit into soap opera territory. The story is a little mechanical in its attempts to cover as much of the post-WWII experience as possible (and somehow work Hoagy Carmichael into the mix). The good news is that the characters are so damn good that the semi-hokey plot doesn't matter.This is a great American movie, remarkable for its realism and lack of sentimentality. Particularly remarkable was Harold Russell, whose portrayal of double-amputee Homer Parrish was believable and very moving. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is the one where Homer is headed to bed, and needs his father to help take off his prosthetic hands and button his pajama top. There is almost no dialogue, and no dramatic swell of the music, just a quiet, honest, matter-of-fact scene.Some of the details intrigued me. The Stephensons slept together in a double bed--a big no-no in those Hayes-code days--but you never actually saw Mrs. Stephenson there. Other commenters have mentioned here the themes of divorce and domestic discord that were all-but-unheard of at the time.I love that Myrna Loy played a great supporting role in this drama as Millie Stephenson, AND had played Nora Charles in THE THIN MAN, among my favorite comedies. Clearly, a versatile talent.Other films have tried to capture the experience of the returning American veteran, but this is probably still the best.",10,0,0,12 October 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Yes, a genuine great
","I'm writing this review long, long after my original viewing of the film, and that's significant in itself: it's stayed with me this long.Ben Affleck did such a good job on this movie I could hardly believe it was him directing. The gritty settings, the bang-on performances, the solid pacing... It flat WORKS just on a cinematic level. It's a good detective story with really compelling characters. Notably, Casey Affleck's performance is magnificent. Deadpan, absolutely, but it's a character that demands it.What elevates Gone Baby Gone to true greatness, though, is the moral question posed in the course of the story. It's a great movie to see with other people, because it's sure to raise discussion.",9,0,1,20 January 2017
"Monsters, Inc."," Oddly enough, truly great...
","I've posted a comment on Monsters Inc. before, but I wanted to follow up from the perspective of multiple viewings (my 2 year old daughter has taken to this movie like nothing else *grin*).*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*As much as I enjoyed Monsters Inc. on the first few viewings, imagine my amazement when I started seeing actual SUBTEXT in this cartoon.Okay, so the 'accidental fatherhood' theme has appeared in many other movies (Three Men and a Baby comes to mind), but it works here, and is referred to in the script a couple of times.  Monster Sully really becomes a 'father-figure' to the little girl who accidentally makes her way to Monstropolis, and passes through the same stages many real fathers do, from utter terror to affection to love.  The strongest element in Monsters Inc is that it's very easy to believe in the relationship between Sully and 'Boo' (the name he eventually gives the child, to buddy Mike's dismay).   When Sully inadvertantly scares the girl in a demo for new trainees his dismay is convincing and heart-breaking.  The scene where Sully finally returns 'Boo' to her own room is really an understated, emotional masterpiece, from the girl's initial glee at being home (and the way she shows off all her toys to her new friend Sully--a marvellous detail) to Sully's heavy-hearted exit. A nice detail about that exit--the animators may have been tempted to show a teardrop fall from Sully's eye, but instead we just see his eyes visibly moisten as he turns to go.  I loved it.The point that 'laughter is ten times more powerful than scream' is actually a lovely touch, carrying the implication that a cooperative solution is always preferable to a confrontational one.  Even better, while this message is made distinctly, it isn't stated overbearingly.  It's a nice message for parents and labor negotiators alike.  It might be stretching, but I think there's even an environmental implication to this message that's not stated directly in the movie, but definitely seems to be alluded to.More unstated messages come from Mr. Waternoose (of course voiced masterfully by the late James Coburn).  In the commentary track on the DVD director Pete Docter notes that Coburn brought a warmth and a vulnerability to the character that none of the writers had seen, and that kind of added dimension makes him that much more powerful as a villain.  He also represents a dangerous resistance to change, and to adopt a cooperative solution in favor of one that's even more exploitive; Waternoose's idea of innovation is not just to continue victimizing children, but to escalate that victimization to an unspeakable new level.Okay, okay... I might just have too much time on my hands to start reading these messages into Monsters Inc, but I swear they're here.  And I don't think there's QUITE this much depth to, say, Shrek (which I continue to like a lot, BTW) or A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (which I also love, but for different reasons). ...And another note on the music: while Randy Newman's theme song 'If I Didn't Have You' is pretty much a rehash of a lot of other songs he's done in the last decade or so, his score for Monsters Inc is marvellous.  His theme for the little girl is rendered in a few different ways, and the simple piano version that plays in the pivotal 'return' scene is just plain wonderful.  And the swinging, big-band style score for the scenes in the Monsters Inc plant are very catchy.Yes, I think Monsters Inc. is a genuinely great movie.  But I feel a little funny admitting that :-)",10,0,1,1 December 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Lovely, charming, FUNNY, and oddly moving.
","Man, these Pixar guys are good.I had missed Monsters Inc. in its theatrical release, but my wife LOVED it and had been literally counting the days down to the DVD release.  We watched it together, and I know why.Monsters Inc. is an absolute charmer, and manages to steer clear of cloying sentiment.  I'll admit, much of my delight in this movie comes from being the father of a 2 year old who seems remarkably similar to 'Boo', and I loved the convincing relationship between Sully and Boo.And they chose a wonderfully understated ending.  I loved it.",10,0,1,17 September 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Among the Disney 'greats'. Really.
","Yup, I'll give it a ten. Lilo & Stitch is right up there with classics like Dumbo and Peter Pan. It's wonderful to see Disney when they get it right.In this case, getting it right meant taking some risks. The animation and art work in L&S are big, bright, and different. Computer aided animation is used sparingly and effectively, particularly in a couple of dance scenes that to my eye made use of some motion capture techniques.The bigger risk here, though, is with a storyline that's somewhat edgier than you'd usually find in a Disney family film. Edgy to the point of earning the movie an unusual PG rating. Lilo is not the most sympathetic of Disney heroines, and her family situation is presented with surprising frankness.There are some lovely messages here, perhaps most prominently that the family you choose can be just as important as the family you're born with. Even with this degree of meaning, though, L&S wouldn't be worth the time it takes to watch if it weren't entertaining as well. Stitch is a very original character, and his creator Jumba is hilarious. The whole Elvis angle shouldn't work at all, but it actually manages to add some charm to the story.Disney animators should look back at this film as clear evidence that traditional 2D animation is far from dead. Instead of trying to compete with Pixar by producing marginal material like Chicken Little, they should leave Pixar to its strength, and return to their own.",10,1,2,26 March 2006
Shrek Forever After," A Welcome Surprise
","While 'Shrek Forever After' may not recapture the biting wit and comedy of the original, it may just have the strongest story of the series.I think we can all agree that the third instalment of the Shrek series was mailed-in, and while there was a surprisingly good Christmas special last year, I wasn't holding out much hope for this film.As a mid-40s dad myself, I had no problem relating to the setup, that Shrek had become mired in the routine of family life and had started to question the choices he's made. After a birthday party outburst, he's offered a deal by Rumplestiltskin that give him a chance to be the feared, powerful ogre he was in younger days.Of course, there's a catch, and Shrek finds himself with the opportunity to see a world where he'd never been born a la Frank Capra. Sure, it's been done before, but the script uses the conceit well and the creative choices generally make sense.No, 'Shrek Forever After' isn't as funny as the original 'Shrek' (but what is?), but it's the story that's more important in this one anyway.Dreamworks has said this will be the last 'Shrek', and it's a high note to end the series. Surely, we'll see more TV specials, and perhaps a spin off or two, but it's nice to see the writers do something worthwhile with these characters.",8,3,5,30 May 2010
Ratatouille," Very, very good... but...
","I love Pixar. As a studio they have created a new form of cinema that grows and evolves with every new film they make. In fact, I'd say that if I had the chance to work for any company in the world, Pixar would be it, even if it was just to empty the trash.What I've admired most about Pixar movies is that story has always been of the utmost importance; technology has always been used to serve the story, not the other way around.Being the Pixar fan that I am, I was looking forward to RATATOUILLE, particularly since director Brad Bird did such a wonderful job with THE INCREDIBLES, and I'm sort of a sucker for 'follow your dream' stories to begin with. The idea of a rat who dreams of cooking in a Paris restaurant sounded just goofy enough to work.On a lot of levels, RATATOUILLE does work. Bird was clearly ambitious here, with an obvious affection for food, Paris, and good restaurants. The kitchen he renders here is beautifully detailed and Bird even manages to sneak in a little tour that faithfully describes the various positions. Visually, there is a lovely warmth to this movie; who could have foreseen 10 years ago that CG animation could do justice to the City of Light? The weakness here is in the story. And it's not that the story is bad--it's orders of magnitude better than, say, SHREK THE THIRD--just not strong enough to support director Bird's ambitions. There is little real sense of peril here, and the characters aren't terribly well-developed.I enjoyed RATATOUILLE, even admired much of it, but Pixar needs to sharpen its story skills if it wants to stay at the top of the heap.",8,3,6,30 June 2007
Spirited Away," Charming, VERY imaginative, memorable
","Spirited Away is simply a lovely movie.It is a work of genius, but sort of a sneaky one.  Yes, the hand-drawn visuals are wonderful (each frame is a work of art).  There are some intriguing contrasts between natural beauty and mechanized squalor, and an implied environmental message.  The plot isn't terribly important, but the characters are.  One of the things I love about this move is that Miyazaki doesn't consider it necessary to explain his characters.  They're just THERE, in a glory of imaginative output that somehow made me think of 'Being John Malkovich' (not that the movies are similar in any way but their sheer imaginative breadth).Some moments are very funny, others quite disturbing, yet others strangely touching.  For me, it was one of those rare instances where a critically-acclaimed movie actually exceeded my expectations.",10,0,1,14 May 2003
Batman Begins," Uncommonly intelligent
","While I had a feeling this would be at worst a worthwhile way to kill an evening, I was quite impressed with BATMAN BEGINS.I have to say that Warner Brothers actually seems to have a pretty good bead on the Batman character; Tim Burton's versions were at least interesting and fun, and WB has gone on to produce two unusually-good animated series over the past several years (let's just pretend the Joel Schumacher versions didn't even happen though, okay?).Still, after the campy 60s TV show and four uneven movies, you'd think this character had been pretty much done to death. Surprise, surprise to find that Batman can be resurrected as the thinking man's superhero.Even before seeing the glowing reviews, I was drawn to BATMAN BEGINS for two reasons: Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale. Nolan's MOMENTO remains one of the most clever movies of the past several years with its 'regressive' storyline. And Bale has crafted a really nifty, 'under-the-radar' kind of career with films like American PSYCHO and THE MACHINIST (a side note: I was intrigued with how much the actor cast as young Bruce Wayne in the opening scenes resembled Bale in EMPIRE OF THE SUN).There are grand themes here, and the reference to opera early on is not accidental. Fear, strength, justice, revenge, they're all here in a grand story told with surprising plausibility. We get to find out that Batman has no superpowers per se, just outstanding martial arts training and some very expensive technology. That a figure who wants to 'save' the world can be just as damaging as one who wants to control it. There are even several veiled references (and one direct one) to Karl Jung's theory of archetypes and their impact on the human psyche. BATMAN BEGINS manages to transcend its own genre and becomes a contemplation of just what the superhero represents.Not that it's completely without flaws, unfortunately. Nolan builds great suspense, and I liked his visuals. But in some of the fight scenes I found myself wishing that John Woo had poked in on the set to consult. Katie Holmes wasn't terribly compelling, and while she wasn't horribly bad, either, she doesn't provide as strong a presence as, say, Kirsten Dunst has in the Spiderman movies. And casting Michael Caine as Alfred was just distracting; any time he appeared on screen I found myself thinking 'wow, Bruce Wayne is so rich he can hire Michael FREAKIN Caine as his butler!' The supporting cast is pretty good, though. Nice to see Gary Oldman cast as a good guy for once ('Detective' Gordon? Are we likely to see a few promotions over the next few movies?). Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman, and that's fine with me. Rutgar Hauer seems to be channeling Bill Clinton AND Donald Trump in his role as CEO of Wayne Enterprises. Tom Wilkinson is one of Hollywood's great unsung talents.I wouldn't even call BATMAN BEGINS 'flawed', just a little weak in a few spots. Completely forgivable. Bring on the sequel.",9,0,1,3 July 2005
The Princess Bride," So many perfect elements... Where to begin?
","In '86 I was lucky to find an old paperback copy of William Goldman's 'The Princess Bride' at a yard sale. I had already read some of his novels, and while I hadn't heard of this particular one, I quickly consumed it, enjoying it tremendously. It was a very clever, but ultimately affectionate, parody of fairy-tale conventions with an equally clever and complicated narrative. It was a fun, memorable book, and when I heard not long after about a film adaptation, I wondered how much of the book's clever tone would translate to the screen.Quite a bit, as it turned out. Rob Reiner's movie version is an outstanding movie, and one that I was pleased to see holds up incredibly well, even a quarter-century later.The brilliance to this movie is in its tone. As I said, it's a parody of fairy-tale conventions. Goldman's characters start out as cardboard-cutout stereotypes, and the events of the story itself are outlandishly improbable (up to and including resurrection), but even as the story gently mocks those conventions, it ultimately still depends on them in the end.The characters are marvelous. Vizzini and his outbursts of 'Inconceivable!!', kind-hearted Fezzik with his rhyming, and Inigo Montoya, with his graciousness, honor, and drive for revenge. Carey Elwes' Wesley is a great balance of clever humor and chivalry, and Robin Wright's Buttercup is a smart, strong fairytale princess. All the performances are note-perfect.And the script is brilliant (as well it should be, with Goldman adapting his own novel). The dialogue sparkles, with enough memorable lines to fill a book. We get to love these characters, and care what happens to them (when Inigo finally gets the chance to avenge his father's death, it's surprisingly dramatic and emotional).The story in the film is simpler than that of the book. Among other things, the book goes WAY further into Vizzini's, Fezzik's, and Inigo's backstories, and it's absolutely a worthwhile read, but there was no way it could have all been translated to the screen. As I say, it's an unusually good adaptation.I enjoyed it even more than I did on its original release. That's an easy definition of 'classic'.",10,1,2,10 December 2011
Cars," About those mixed reviews...
","...DON'T believe them. CARS is as good as anything Pixar has produced. It's a big, bright, fun, very American movie.It isn't perfect, and I'll quickly point out the two real flaws I saw in it. First, despite some great action sequences in the first half-hour or so, the story doesn't really get going, and I found it a little harder to get into this little universe than I did for, say, Monsters Inc. Have patience, though, because the story has a lot of heart to it, and the characters really do 'come to life' as the story goes on.The only other 'flaw' is that the rendering of Pixar's movies is getting so good that they hardly look animated anymore. This film may not hold the attention of small children, believe it or not.Now for the good stuff... Pixar's strength has always been in presenting great stories. They might use the best technology to do it, but story has always been king at Pixar, and CARS doesn't disappoint here (though as I said, it takes a little time to get rolling). In this case, the story is really an utter cliché, on many levels , and it's presented with a complete lack of irony. This is an old-fashioned Hollywood comedy in a lot of ways. Elvis could have starred in this movie in 1959 if there had been some way to magically morph him into a car. There are some lovely messages in the movie, like the value of slowing down, and taking the road less travelled. The climactic race actually manages to turn a race-movie cliché or two on its head, to great effect.The characters are terrific, with Paul Newman's Doc Hudson rating special mention. Of course Paul Newman would do a movie like this, he's been in racing for decades. Not so obvious is that the car his character is based on, the Hudson Hornet, really WAS a great race car in its day. 'The King' is based on the legendary Dodge Charger Daytona. And while I wouldn't have cast a Porsche 911 as the female lead (I thought the Boxter was Porsche's 'chick' car), Pixar veteran Bonnie Hunt's Sally makes a great foil for Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen.As usual, the art direction is fantastic. I loved the car-forms in the buttes surrounding Radiator Springs (I even recognized a Cord 810 in one scene), and there's a plethora of detail in virtually every frame. I can't wait for the DVD to re-watch and freeze-frame. The cars have very realistic physics for the most part, and like the fish in Finding Nemo, maintain a remarkable verisimilitude.The in-jokes fly fast and furious here (in fact, there's a cute dig at THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, come to think of it). Jokes about cars, jokes about NASCAR (and even a little F1), and--of course--jokes about Pixar. Don't leave when the credits start to roll.'They don't build 'em like they used to...' goes the old expression, but CARS has a lot of old-fashioned, traditional qualities. It works as a family comedy, as a beautifully-rendered piece of animated art, and as a great tribute to Route 66 and the American automobile. You won't go wrong with this one.",9,4,6,12 June 2006
Drive," No. Just, no.
","This is an awful movie. Perhaps all the more so because there were the ever-so-slight hints that it might have been good.Watch the first half-hour. Gosling's (unnamed) character, when spoken to, takes ridiculously long pauses--upwards of 10 seconds--to respond.>>>Spoilers ahead The story is, um, flimsy. Porn-movie flimsy. There is a central crime to this story that never really IS explained very well (sure, it looked really cool when that other car showed up, but... wwwhy was it there, exactly?), and is really the product of a monumental coincidence. Think about it: Gosling just happens to be the driver for a holdup where his neighbor is robbing cash from a pawn shop in a heist that's really been masterminded by... the guy who's bankrolling his race car? Huh? (and, no, the story makes absolutely NO effort to explain this).As much as I love Ryan Gosling, he's just plain bad here. Maybe not 'just plain' bad; spectacularly, pretentiously bad. I know what the creative intent was, that the character was just something of a 'blank canvas' that others project their wants and needs on to. The biggest problem here is that Gosling can't tone down the smart and charming enough for us to believe that he's as socially isolated as his character really should be. And, again, he tends to try to substitute blankness for intensity. It doesn't work.Carey Mulligan is okay, but her character is pretty one-dimensional as well. I got zero chemistry off of the combo of her and Gosling. The kid is basically a prop. I'm sorry, I got absolutely nothing to say why this guy develops an attachment to these two.When Mulligan's husband appears, there's actually a little tension for a bit, and I began to hope for some substance (especially since he has considerably more chemistry with Mulligan than Gosling does). Sadly, 'Standard' is killed off fairly quickly.There's no shortage of great performers in this movie, and they're mostly wasted. Ron Perlman is so awesomely menacing! And so completely under-written! And what's there is clichéd! God, what were these people thinking? Bryan Cranston has a supporting role as Gosling's partner/boss. A huge opportunity is wasted when his character's interest in the stolen money is just casually discarded. That might have actually GONE somewhere. As a 'Breaking Bad' fan, I know just how good he can be, but the writing here is nowhere near as good, and his character, as well, is left adrift.And Albert Brooks. Who I've loved since 'Lost in America'. It breaks my heart, because he's actually awesome in this movie. One of the most compelling cinematic criminals since Brando, I kid you not. Thoughtful, emotional, utterly believable, but since he's the only character that we develop even the remotest sympathy for, he's not quite enough to redeem this mess.I was hoping for some action, at least. And there really isn't much. For a movie about a driver, there honestly isn't that much driving. The movie opens with a not-bad robbery getaway, but there's only one more serious chase later on, and even IT isn't especially noteworthy. Did none of these people even WATCH 'Bullitt'? And, speaking of car action, there's one scene where Gosling's character repeatedly rams another car. Hard. Hard enough to send it rolling off a small cliff. And yet, afterwards, we see the front end of his car, seemingly undamaged. Are mid-70s Chevelle parts really that hard to come by? There are legitimate flashes of creativity in 'Drive'. There are some genuinely original scenes of violence (and, to be fair, well-executed). Had the story and characters risen to a level where the audience might have cared, well, this might have been a different movie.This is one of those 'emperor's-new-clothes' things the movie industry pulls on the public every once in a while. Don't fall for it.",3,383,724,17 September 2011
Room," Surprisingly entertaining, even life-affirming
","Given the disturbing premise of 'Room', I was expecting emotional intensity, a fairly static plot, and a generally dark tone, so I was surprised to find this movie to be an engagingly-told story of resiliency.Both Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley are outstanding. Playing mother and son, their characters and relationship are completely convincing, and while the story starts fairly quietly (perhaps to reflect Joy's and Jack's captivity), the story gains intensity as Joy realizes the need to escape, and prepares Jack to help in the attempt.This is a story about trauma, survival, and resiliency, told very quietly and carefully. I marvel at films that find the significance in the everyday, without having to warp it for dramatic effect. 'Room' achieves it beautifully.",9,0,3,6 March 2016
The Incredibles," Pixar strikes out in an 'Incredible' new direction
","I've long been a fan of Pixar's work (MONSTERS INC. being my personal favorite), and I've long been awed by their insistence on strong storytelling at the heart of their technological masterpieces.While all of the Pixar films have been great family movies, THE INCREDIBLES moves into more sophisticated, more 'adult' territory, with themes of mid-life crisis and marital discord. It is also somewhat more violent than previous Pixar efforts, with a darker overall tone.Far from being a bad thing, I like that the studio is striking out for new creative ground. For this particular outing, they had the capable guidance of Brad Bird. A veteran of Disney, 'The Simpsons', and the similarly dark THE IRON GIANT, Bird has brought a remarkable vision to light.And 'vision' is the key here. The best part of this movie is its look. The retro feel here is wonderful, and created by a variety of details. The cars in particular struck me; almost all of the cars in this film were custom designed, but carried an authentic retro look. The villain's island had a wonderful James Bond kind of feel to it, in a way that James Bond movies themselves quit feeling like way back in the sixties.The whole world, in fact, looked a lot 'realer' here than it has in any previous CGI film, though human characters apparently still need a little work; rather than make them real here the animators elected for a kind of 'Thunderbirds' marionette feel, with a few detailed features thrown into the mix for a little texture (see Bob's eyebrows or Syndrome's hair). The retro feel actually almost seems like a further development of the robot in THE IRON GIANT.In terms of narrative, Bird's script avoids the obvious pop-culture shots that have become a clichÃ© in this genre. SHARK TALE proves that this kind of storytelling may very well be dead (or at least seriously stale), and it's wise that they've abandoned it here. There do seem to be some VERY subtle references here, and I look forward to buying the DVD to search them out, but the ones I did pick up were all pretty subdued (like baby 'Jack-Jack' Parr... hmmmm...).The characters themselves were all pretty good. I found the story a little more engaging than FINDING NEMO, though perhaps not quite as good as MONSTERS INC. or THE IRON GIANT. Though the fabulous visuals make up a little ground; I frequently found myself grinning at the sheer visual invention of THE INCREDIBLES. Right down to the credits at the end.This is a fun movie, and a great addition to Pixar's already-considerable portfolio. It also shows an intriguing new direction for animation in general.",9,0,1,16 November 2004
Cars 2," I don't know where to start...
","I can't believe I'm saying this about a Pixar film, but 'Cars 2' is a monumental waste of talent and technology. And what concerns me most is that what this movie gets wrong is the most important thing Pixar has always gotten right.The storytelling is a massive letdown, for a few reasons. The first is that I think they tried to stretch the anthropomorphism of the cars too far; in an early suspense scene secret agent Finn McMissile (voiced by Michael Caine) sneaks around on an oil platform in ways that make him seem well-nigh invincible, and another character who arrives later is able to sprout wings and fly... Why would a car want to roll when it could fly, anyway? The espionage angle didn't have to fall flat (and I actually really liked the way McMissile was executed as a character), but it took these characters to a place they really didn't seem to belong, a fairly brutal murder just being one instance. We also learn somewhat more about the toilet habits of cars here, which starts to beg the question of how they fulfil other biological needs. In the first movie we didn't even START to go there, and I'm not sure it was a great creative decision here.The characters are flat, which is an unusual Pixar failing, too. There is a cardboard kind of friendship between Lightning McQueen and sidekick Tow Mater that seems mailed in from a '70s after-school special, and verges on creepy. Poor 'Mater is the subject of a great many jokes, few of which are really terribly funny.The 'new-enviro-fuel-threatened-by-evil-big-oil' is okay, if a little over-simplified, and I 'got' the film's notion that it's the 'lemons' of the world who hold us back, but I was a bit conflicted over the ending (and, yes, the SPOILER ALERT goes here). Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard) is an older Range Rover oil baron who has supposedly seen the light and converted to greener technology, though in the end he turns out to be the mastermind working to discredit his own alternative fuel, as he has since found a massive sub-ocean oil deposit. On one hand, this twist seemed to discredit the notion of alternative fuel entirely, but I also have to admit that such corporate 'greenwashing' actually exists. Frankly, 'Monsters, Inc.' had a similar message, but it was much clearer there.Story and character are pretty important, and Cars 2 fails miserably on both counts. Technically? Well, that's a brighter side there, as everything LOOKS fantastic. And I'll confess that I enjoyed many, MANY in-jokes. The movie is FILLED with Easter eggs for both car nuts and Pixar fans.One of the best little 'inside baseball' moments came when an American agent who had infiltrated the bad guys disguised as an old Gremlin took off his disguise to reveal himself as a new Dodge Challenger; Chrysler bought AMC back in the 80s, and this scene almost seemed a symbol of its renewal. Unfortunately, this and many other moments suggest that Pixar may have worked fairly closely with Chrysler in a rather subversive form of product placement. A race that takes place in a very Monaco-like locale was actually moved to Italy, I suspect as an excuse to feature many Fiat models; Fiat, of course, now owns Chrysler.Clever in-jokes can't be the basis for a movie on their own. Particularly when many of them seem to be motivated by marketing. Even that MIGHT have been forgivable with decent characters and story. Lacking these, 'Cars 2' is Pixar's first unqualified failure.",3,4,5,19 November 2011
Children of Men," Enthralling craftsmanship
","While I'd heard good buzz about this film, I managed to miss it until recently. My loss.CHILDREN OF MEN actually manages to re-validate science fiction, a genre I would have sworn was dying. The story and the messages here are grim and entirely believable.I suspect Universal had a hard time marketing this movie; its visual brilliance comes from the world created in the story, and few of the visuals would look like much taken out of context for a trailer or a clip on a late-night talk show. This world is amazingly--and VERY convincingly--rendered.There is a great deal to like about this movie. The premise is dead-simple, but chilling: what if for some reason all humanity became infertile? And, given our abuse of ourselves and our environment, how implausible is that premise, anyway? That this crisis triggers xenophobia on a massive scale is no great surprise.One point I found intriguing is the complete lack of 'sides'; the rebels and the government both behave abhorrently. The story is thoughtful, and quite moving. This is a story that compares to sci-fi classics like '1984' and 'Farenheit 451'.Performances are all very good. Michael Caine actually immerses himself in a character, for once, instead of wrestling it to the ground. I hadn't much liked Clive Owen in the other movies I'd seen him (he was badly miscast in SIN CITY), but he is fantastic here.",9,2,14,23 November 2007
La La Land," Yes, legitimately great
","Okay, big deal, they've made an original Hollywood musical for the first time in decades, and the music is okay, and it's all a big L.A. love-fest. Ho-hum.BUT... La La Land really IS that good, even if it doesn't immediately present itself as anything more than a fluffy confection. This takes its place comfortably with 'An American in Paris' (to which it pays considerable homage).To me this is kind of a 'guerilla musical'; most of the shots seemed to source from hand-held cameras. It's a low-budget production that frequently uses lighting effects that would be at home in a high school musical. There's little in the way of purpose-built sets and heavy use is made of locations with showbiz-themed murals and the like.The movie is set in present-day Los Angeles, and fits the classic romantic comedy rags-to-riches template. Neither lead is either a great dancer or a great singer, but the characters are engaging and they're having so much damn fun that it's easy to get pulled in.This is a sticky-sweet L.A. love story, presented without a whit of irony, and its sincere cheer is infectious. The original music is nice and catchy and both Gosling and Stone present fun, relatable characters.***SPOILER*** Where La La Land goes from escapist confection to truly great is in the final number, a bittersweet composition that re-imagines the story of Nia and Sebastian with some crucial differences. It's an expression of regret and longing and somehow makes a meaningful comment about the ways we want to reshape reality. The ending is note-perfect.Lovely movie. Worth the hype.",10,6,11,18 February 2017
How to Train Your Dragon," The most brilliantly-rendered creature in film
","I missed HTTYD in its theatrical release, but being the animation enthusiast that I am, and having heard some positive reviews, I was happy to see the film on DVD. My modestly positive expectations were greatly surpassed.My first impression was that the visuals were exceptional; the night shots of the village and the contrast with fire from the dragons' attack was very impressive. The animators managed to do a very good job of rendering the clear, crisp feeling of a cold, starry night. The level of detail was remarkable; textures of rough, weathered wood and battered metal looked very authentic.The story is very familiar; essentially 'local goofball makes good'. So, being that we've all seen it before, why is it so good here? That technical excellence helps; this really feels like a world we haven't really seen before, but it's rendered gorgeously. Lush forests are contrasted with forbidding rocky coasts. The characters are great too; Jay Baruchel makes the central character Hiccup sound sufficiently nebbishy, and is ably supported by Gerard Butler as Hiccup's imposing father Stoick and Craig Ferguson as Cobber.When the story opens, Hiccup's home island of Berk is being attacked by marauding dragons. Hiccup is not the most manly of Berk's inhabitants, and is beset by a tendency to daydream. He has created a device that he believes will help bring down the attackers, and sneaks out to try it in battle. It works--Hiccup knows he's brought something down but it lands too far away for him to investigate--but the unintended consequences cause considerable damage. Hiccup's father Stoick is clearly disappointed.When Hiccup goes out the next day to try to find what he might have brought down, he finds a dragon that no one has ever seen before; a dreaded Night Fury. But its tail is injured, and it cannot escape the sinkhole where it landed.Hiccup comes to name his find 'Toothless', and the relationship they build is central to the film. Toothless is an amazingly-imagined creature who expresses an incredible range of emotions over the course of the story. As Hiccup gains Toothless' trust, he learns far more about dragons as a species than his fellows at home ever knew.So, more cliché, Hiccup befriends Toothless, trains him in secret, and eventually becomes the first human to actually RIDE a dragon. But this process is told so convincingly and beautifully that it comes across very naturally.The story has some nice twists, too, like when Hiccup discovers that the dragons are not merely stealing the villagers' food for their own sake.There are great messages in the film. The usual 'be true to yourself' stuff, sure, but deeper ones about trust and loyalty as well. They all come organically out of the story, rather than feeling imposed.Ever since the original Shrek, I knew that Dreamworks could compete with Pixar when they really felt like it. The journey's been uneven but they've continued to produce some very good work on occasion. This movie, though, is maybe the first one that can be considered with Pixar's very best movies. The next Oscars in 2011 may finally see an animated film win as Best Picture; How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story 3 are both good enough to be contenders. With its dazzling technical merits, its well-written story and its great, original characters, I think I'd vote for the dragons.",10,0,1,7 November 2010
To Kill a Mockingbird," Possibly, my all-time favorite film...
","...and I see a LOT of movies.  There are so few films that transcend merely entertaining or provoking thought and actually make a difference to at least some people.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one of them.When I look at movies, I frequently look at messages and values.  A movie doesn't HAVE to have these (AIRPLANE! is also pretty high on my 'all-time' list), but to be considered truly 'great', I think there has to be some substance.Some of the messages in TKAM are fairly obvious: Jim Robinson's trial displays the ugliness of racism, and Boo Radley shows how easy it is to misjudge people and dismiss them.  But there are more subtle, richer, messages as well: Atticus Finch doesn't just love his children, he respects them; Atticus also demonstrates by representing Jim Robinson that a good man isn't just 'good' for some and not for others.The messages in the film--even the most obvious ones--are presented with an air of dignity and understatement, many through Gregory Peck's character of Atticus.  The characters are believable (Jem and Scout rank among the most unaffected child performances ever captured on film), and they present a marvellously moving story.I consider myself a fairly sophisticated film-goer, and I have my favorites among foreign film, documentaries, action flicks, and even animation.  But for me, To Kill a Mockingbird is like an old, dear friend due to its sincerity, and its charm.",10,1,2,22 March 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," Timeless story, timeless performance...
","To be honest, it has been many years since I've seen this film, and of course I'm here today on hearing of Peck's death last night.In a way, it's just as well that it's a good couple of decades since seeing MOCKINGBIRD (though I'll be buying my own copy soon), since it remains one of my all-time favorite movies.  Yes, it was beautifully, understatedly filmed (and the lovely black and white cinematography seems to highlight the shades of grey in the story).  And yes, there was a powerful, confidently-presented message of toleranceWhat stays with me to this day, though, is the relationship Finch had with his children.  As a father, Atticus Finch showed more respect for his children than I recall ever seeing ANYWHERE.  I remember seeing this respectful relationship, and being deeply touched by it.  I still remember it as my own daughter grows up, and while I can't claim to reach that standard, I at least do my best to remember it.",10,0,1,12 June 2003
Ray," Best picture? Possibly. Best Actor? DEFINITELY!
","The Academy could do worse than to award RAY Best Picture at the Oscars this year. I'm pretty sure they'll give Jamie Foxx Best Actor...I'm not a particular fan of Ray Charles. Nor do I like biopics as a rule. But this film elevates itself above the ordinary for two reasons: Jamie Foxx, and Ray Charles himself.First off, hats off to the late, great Mr. Charles himself. This was his story, and his movie (and he has an Executive Produder credit to show for it). This is not the most flattering portrayal, dealing with Charles' drug addiction and womanizing with extraordinary frankness. That Charles would allow this much of his life to be publicized so openly only suggests to me that he thought they were important elements in considering his life in its entirety. My respect for Charles as a man has grown, not because of these faults so much as his willingness to acknowledge them and accept responsibility for them.Secondly, Jamie Foxx portrays Ray Charles with one of the best performances I've seen in years. He is relaxed and confident in this role, and it seems more like more like Charles just kind of moved in to Foxx's body for a few months while they filmed. This was a role that could have easily come across as a mannered caricature (see Eddie Murphy's impression of Stevie Wonder on '80s SNL reruns), and instead it plays as utterly believable.It's the strength of Foxx's portrayal, in fact, that prompted me to see this movie to begin with; I wasn't expecting much more than a great performance. As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised with an engaging script that mostly dodges clichés. This is an entertaining, engaging movie--much more than the usual music-industry bio. This movie moves along far better than something 153 minutes long should.It isn't flawless. The secondary characters are pretty two-dimensional, and I swear all the performance scenes 'on the road' in the early part of the movie were shot on the same set.Worse pictures have won the 'Best Picture' Oscar. And Foxx is simply GOING to win for Best Actor.",9,0,1,17 February 2005
Inception," I liked it. Your results may vary...
","There's a lot to like about Christopher Nolan's 'Inception'. There's some thrilling action, some spectacular visuals, and some occasionally clever dialogue. There's also some problems with Christopher Nolan's 'Inception'. The characters are mostly underwritten, the premise takes some work to buy into, and it's probably a good half-hour longer than it should be.I liked it, with some effort, but I won't think any less of you if you don't. There's a fairly cool opening action sequence, but after that the film descends into a good hour or so of exposition that bogs down enough that it stands to alienate a good chunk of the audience.The biggest problem with the movie (aside from the mostly-flat characters) is that the dream sequences aren't particularly 'dreamy'. The odd strange thing happens, sure, but there's a logic and structure to these dreams that I've never encountered in my own personal dreams. I was prepared to put a little work into my suspension of disbelief, but those flat characters don't make it any easier. This movie never engaged me to the point where I forgot I was watching a movie.It isn't a bad story, though. Nolan doesn't leave any nagging loose ends in his script, and if you've put in that effort to maintain your own suspension of disbelief up to, say, the 80 minute mark, you will be rewarded with a rather slick, multi-layered narrative and a pretty satisfying ending. But if you don't put in that effort, you're likely to find the whole thing to be kind of overwrought and tedious.As I say, I liked it, but it's far from being Christopher Nolan's 'masterpiece' as some critics have hailed it. 'Memento' was smarter, sharper, and infinitely more involving. And, yes, 'The Dark Knight' was far more engaging, too.'Inception' is probably worth seeing in a theatre if only for the visuals and the action sequences. Park your brain at the door, and try not to expect too much, and you might stand a chance of liking it as much as I did.",7,3,9,18 July 2010
Vanilla Sky," (much) better than average...
","I'm not seeing this film popping up in many '10 Best' lists, or in the Golden Globe nominations, for that matter.  Pity...I saw this film last week, and found it nicely exceeded my admittedly low expectations.  In a year where most of the successful blockbusters seemed to be kiddie-fare ('Shrek', 'Harry Potter'), it was refreshing to see a good, adult movie that didn't have to hit you over the head with a sledgehammer to underline its various plot-points.I liked the challenging nature of the story, and I found I enjoyed it best when I just let it sort of 'wash over me', instead of trying to analyze every detail and plot point.  And while I wouldn't go so far as to call it profound, it WAS a nifty piece of story-telling.I do have quibbles; the 'elevator' scene near the end goes into WAY much detail to explain what has happened, and winds up insulting the thoughtful viewer's intelligence when the movie had done such a wonderful job of depending on it up to that point.Even with this, though, I liked and admired Vanilla Sky.  Its labrynthine narrative is a BIG departure for director Cameron Crowe, even with its artistic ambitions manages to be approachable and entertaining.  When my wife and I left the theatre we talked for a good hour or so just trying to piece together exactly what happened.A last note: I've seen some mention of the presence of the World Trade Center twin towers in the background skyline in the rooftop scene at the end.  While this was very much a background detail with NO relevance to the story whatsoever, and while seeing it was a little distracting, I'm glad it was left in.  I'm sure there was much handwringing at Paramount over whether to digitally alter those frames, and the argument could be made that doing so would have been appropriate, but it stands almost as a small, cinematic memorial.  This may well be the last new film we'll see that uses the image of the twin towers as simple buildings, and not as symbols of tragedy.",9,0,0,24 December 2001
Toy Story 3," An evening with old friends...
","Toy Story 3 will go down in history as being one of the (very) rare sequels that genuinely builds on the story of its original.The original Toy Story is an iconic movie, the way The Wizard of Oz was in the thirties. It took a medium that few of us had much faith in, and proved it could be used to tell a fun, involving story.Toy Story 2 wound up taking an interesting turn, becoming a kind of contemplation on the difference between being loved and being revered. Fortunately, the characters stayed true, and the sense of fun remained.While TS3 extends that sense of fun (particularly with new characters like the Ken doll), there is a mournful quality to it that adults will recognize as a sense of mortality. As the movie starts, the toys make an ingenious but ultimately pathetic bid for their owner's attention; they know they are being left behind and possibly discarded. The story is really driven by the toys' efforts to come to terms with that change.It is, at times, fun, inventive, and even thrilling. It says something about the relationship we've had with these characters that when they face certain peril at the climax of the story, their simple response is surprisingly moving.It's that relationship that makes this such a great sequel. Since the original Toy Story was released in 1995, CGI animation has become an important segment of the industry, and the source of some of my favourite films of the past 15 years. I left the theatre thinking about how far the medium has come in that time, and that this movie felt like an evening with old friends.While Disney/Pixar hasn't declared this to be the 'last' of the series, the story arc closes so gracefully that you'd hate to see it embellished simply for the sake of box-office receipts.",9,1,1,16 July 2010
Looper," Thoughtful, character-driven...
","First thing to get out of the way about 'Looper'; time travel is a plot device, and nothing more. The movie is much more about the characters and the implications of their actions. It's kind of a philosophy treatise wrapped up in an engaging action plot.There are multiple holes and inconsistencies in the plot. Honestly, they don't matter. This is a character-driven story, and a rather good one.There's a neat, 'noir-ish' tone to the movie. There's some exposition in the first half-hour that helps us understand the rules of this universe. A great many of these rules are explained in an early sequence where a friend of central character Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fails to 'close his loop' by killing his future self. The results are gruesome, but not in any way we see explicitly.Great sci-fi doesn't actually have to be believable. It just has to provide a setting for a story that wouldn't make sense in our own world. 'Looper' turns out to be a very interesting contemplation of what makes people 'good' and 'bad' and does it with some smartly-conceived action and better-than-average writing.",9,0,1,10 February 2013
Deadpool," I don't even LIKE the Marvel movies...
","...but DEADPOOL was awesome! It was great to find an action-comedy that assumes I'm an adult.It's dumb, it's profane, it's utterly silly, and I loved every minute of it (literally, right from the opening 'credits'). Is there a story in there? Yeah, I guess, but it's really just secondary to Deadpool's constant smart-alec riffing. If anyone was considering writing a Marvel spoof screenplay, don't bother; 'Deadpool' frequently bites the hand that feeds it and skewers the label as thoroughly as anyone could hope.Deadpool 'breaks the 4th wall' frequently, and even parodies that device by breaking the 4th wall in a flashback WHILE breaking the 4th wall ('That's like, 16 walls!').Do NOT take kids. This movie revels in gratuitous violence, graphic language, and juvenile humour, and makes no apologies for any of it. This is an 'R' rated movie and comes by it honestly. If you're good with that, though, the odds are good you'll laugh your butt off.",10,5,19,2 March 2016
300," Oddly uninvolving
","I find Zack Snyder's 300 a bit of a puzzle: I think I admired a lot of it, and I didn't dislike any of it, but it really didn't move me much one way or the other.There's a lot to recommend this movie for. The performances are believable, the visuals are spectacular, and the battle scenes are convincing. Gruesome? I guess, though in a rather stylized way that seems to drain the life out of the whole venture (as opposed to the violence in, say, PAN'S LABYRINTH, which at times made me cringe).Odd, then, that this film that has radically polarized its audience somehow left me as indifferent as it did. I didn't dislike it at all (it's much better than GLADIATOR, for instance), and I found its style intriguing, I just can't say it was enough to get me too worked up.",7,3,5,23 August 2007
Sin City," Great? Possibly. Fun? Not so much...
","SIN CITY gets a good solid 8/10 from me. It's a huge, over-the-top miasma of gore and sex (though mostly gore, really). And no film has so faithfully rendered the feel of a comic book.Visually, the film is utterly brilliant. Mostly black and white, with odd (and frequently disturbing) splotches of color bring a compelling look to a story that relies on film noir conventions mostly without irony.There are some unfortunate weaknesses to this film, though. The unremitting grimness of the various characters gets a little wearisome by the halfway point. The rich, heavy atmosphere that Robert Rodriguez has constructed here gets a little TOO heavy at times. Constructed as a series of loosely-related subplots, some stories are better than others. The middle of this film is taken up with a subplot (featuring Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen) that was probably intended to provide some comic relief, and really just kind of goes off the rails. And, I'm sorry to say, Jessica Alba turns out to be sorely miscast when the story finally turns its attention to her.But where SIN CITY DOES work, it works remarkably well. The story of man-monster Marv and his attempt to avenge the death of his beloved Goldie is compelling, even moving. Is it over the top? Sure, but so is opera. And Mickey Rourke's Marv is probably the best, most convincing character in the film. And the story of Bruce Willis' Hartigan and his attempt to save an 11 year old girl from a sadistic rapist works, mostly.This is not a fun movie. Women are (badly) mistreated, though I'll say it's in the service of the story. The violence is pervasive, graphic, and at times disgustingly original. Part of what I admire about SIN CITY is Robert Rodriguiz' commitment to bring to the screen such a lurid, politically incorrect story in these times of resurging conservatism.",8,0,1,27 August 2005
Happy Feet," I really wanted to love this...
","...but alas, I'll have to settle for a 'strong like'. Now, granted, the idea of dancing penguins is a little 'out there' to begin with, but then, so was a talking pig.George Miller's BABE is one of my all-time favorite movies (and, yes, I feel a little weird admitting that). Not only was BABE cleverly, believably rendered, the message of tolerance grew very naturally from the story's characters. When I heard that Miller was the guiding hand behind HAPPY FEET, I was really expecting something special.I almost got it, too. The animation is absolutely gorgeous here, with creatures that come to life on the screen more realistically than anything else this side of FINDING NEMO. Some of the sequences are just amazing, particularly a couple of underwater scenes. And while some might find the whole pop music thing a little odd, it worked for me much the same way the same kind of device worked in Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE.Some have described the environmental message at the movie's climax as 'heavy-handed'. I wouldn't exactly put it that way, but I will say that I'd have a much easier time buying into HAPPY FEET's message if I cared more about the characters. And that's where this movie falls down.There's more contrivance here than I really care for. The main character of Mumbles is set up as a penguin anti-hero without much explanation. He's just 'different', and that is somehow intrinsically offensive to his community. He is fortunate to find helpful friends instead of becoming someone else's dinner. Of course.He manages to defeat the conventions of his community, find his true love, and single-handedly (single-flipperedly?) draws the world's attention to his species' plight. Of course.Granted, the sequence where Mumbles starts to go insane in captivity is fairly compelling, and in particular the scene where he finally captures the attention of a young girl is quite moving, but even these scenes would have meant so much more if we cared just a little bit more about the central character.I think part of the problem here is that penguins are pretty cute, but there's only so much you can do to render individual birds as characters. They all look pretty much the same, and it gets hard to understand how they can all be so different after a while. The reliance on ethnic stereotypes for humor is a sure-fire hint that the writers were having a tough time moving the story along.Worthwhile? Yes. Great? Not quite, I'm truly sorry to say.",7,0,0,23 April 2007
The Island," *shrug* Worked for me
","As big action-blockbusters go, 'The Island' isn't bad, and deserves a better life on video than it had at the box office. I'd hardly call it great, but like all good science fiction, it has it's basis in ideas, and this movie holds to its ideas well.'The Island' is reasonably entertaining, with some fun (if over-the-top) action sequences, and the production design has some interesting ideas of how we'll live in the future (hint: a LOT of us will apparently be driving Chrysler 300's, especially the police). The 'value of life' argument is developed reasonably well, and the characters manage to hold your attention.Bear in mind that Micheal Bay directed 'Armageddon'. I might not be saying that much, but 'The Island' really is better.",7,3,4,30 April 2006
