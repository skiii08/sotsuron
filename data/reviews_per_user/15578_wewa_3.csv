Underworld," I liked it
","despite all the very bad critics, i liked this movie. the story is so absurd, you must love or hate it. ok I've never seen so much door opening in a movie, but that should be seen as a metaphor not a flaw. kate is really hot in the leading role, and the whole stuff is much better than matrix reloaded/revolutions/revisited whatsoever.Maybe it's cause I like this classic tragedy stuff and the changing sympathy twist between the rivaling groups (lycons/vampires).if you like matrix and hate the commercial drowning of the sequels watch this and equilibrium, which I also highly recommend.definitely 8/10.",8,1,2,22 January 2004
Windtalkers," about men, not war
","though some of the battlescenes could be better for a john woo movie this was far better than 'black hawk down' or 'we where soldiers'. i think even better than 'private ryan'; (spielberg always messes up the end of his movies)cause it's about the relationship of men and not just about goin' somewhere killing some nips, gooks or krauts in shiny pictures.",8,1,2,1 December 2002
