10 Cloverfield Lane," Great thriller, Stupid ending
",Solid psychological thriller piece throughout most of the movie. I loved the kidnapper character and how he was played. But i wish it would have gone in the other direction for the ending.,8,0,0,13 August 2019
Hereditary," This movie has left me speachless
","The movie has done what a horror movie had never done for me before- it left me in complete shock at near the beginning of the movie and held me at the edge of my seat since. The film explores the life of a family facing trauma and a history of something resembling a mental illness. Although the end could have been better for me if it faced another direction, i do understand where the director was going with it. So far, the best horror movie i have ever seen.",10,0,3,14 August 2019
