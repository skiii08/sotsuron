Black Swan," A white swan decays, and a black swan germinate
","WOW! Just wow! Black Swan just blew me away, in every way that a movie should. There is a beautiful balance throughout the movie between the sane and the psychotic and the beauty and the grotesque. You would think the movie might be all about dance, but it really isn't. There is very little talk about the dance steps, and the names of the dance steps, which is perfect if you're not really into dance. The characters have a lot of debt – even the mother who does not have a big role, acts like the supporting mother, when really she's manipulating her daughter into thinking it's her idea. The Swan Lake ballet is an allegory of the protagonist's life on the outside. Her obsession with being perfect and loved, makes her unable to distinguish between reality and dark character in the play. Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting and a hot and raw sex scene, tastefully done. And it keeps you guessing 'till the very end – and perhaps after as the interpretation is not carved in stone. This might just be my new favorite movie of all time. Don't walk to the movie theater, RUN!",10,6,12,5 February 2011
Unknown," Like clever thrillers? Keep looking.
","I'll admit that I didn't expect this to be my favorite movie to begin with, but I did expect to be somewhat entertained throughout the movie. The first word that comes to mind is «pointless». The action sequences are predictable, the script is flat, and the acting is uninspiring, which is sad considering that I really like Diane Krueger and find Liam Neeson to be solid. I won't make you read a novel here, so I'll just sum it up real' quick:Man gets in an accident and is struggling to make sense of who he is. This goes on for such a long time that I just stopped caring and thought: just get to the ending already. And yes, you guessed it, a couple of «mysterious» men are chasing him for an unknown reason, which leads to the inevitable getaway chase and action scenes you've seen a million times. And the average female cab driver turns out to be a natural killing ninja, pro fighter and an expert on high speed car getaways. 'Cause you know, why wouldn't she be. And to top it off, the ending is random with no previous clues to go on. I'm sure a lot of people will like this movie, but if you like your thrillers to be clever and mysterious, I'd recommend another movie. The only thing I will remember from this movie a month from now is that I thought it was a waste of time.",2,3,5,25 August 2011
