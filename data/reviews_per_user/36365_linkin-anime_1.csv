Despicable Me 2," One word- MINIONASTIC!!
","I had loved the first movie for the theme and of course, for the heart- warming story of a Bad-guy-turning-good. Now, in the second movie,one look at the teasers and we got to know that this had plenty of mad minions running amok and a purple monster let out loose. With plenty of minion movies out in Youtube, I have become a self- proclaimed Minion fan and this was the Major reason for me to watch this movie! Was I let down? Well, No!! I got my share of U2 styled minions, Hawaii styled minions, nanny styled minions and many more of Kevin, Dave and they gave the movie a push that has made Despicable 2 better than the first one for sure! A villain turned doting father is what Gru has become and the story goes ahead with a lot of love, relationships and family themes running in the background of heinous plots, villains and monsters. I would rate this movie a cool 9 out of 10!! any day!!",9,0,1,5 July 2013
