Catch Me If You Can," Ehh.
","**MILD SPOILERS**
I was dragged to see this with the family on Christmas, and it was definitely my least favorite 'present' of the day.The main flaw in the film was that of its main character:  Frank Abagnale, Jr.  I can't support a character being portrayed as a 'hero' if in fact they aren't one.  Abagnale had no conscience, no moral center, no concern for all the innocent people he duped and tricked.  Plus the film didn't show how he slipped from perfect schoolboy into cold-hearted conman; it just *happened*. If Abagnale had been portrayed as more of a villain, I would have liked the film more.  Leonardo DiCaprio's largely sleep-walking performance didn't help.I give this film 4 out of 10:  one point for Tom Hanks's excellent portrayal of Carl Hanratty, one point for John Williams's lovely musical score, one point for Thierry Kuntzel's lovely credit sequence, and one for the 'airport pickup' gag; you'll know it when you see it.",4,0,7,27 December 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Hilarious comedy in the tradition of 'The Emperor's New Groove!'
","*mild spoilers*When 'The Emperor's New Groove' was released, I was worried that this highly witty, sarcastic, and above all funny movie from Disney would be an aberration, a one-shot deal.Thankfully, 'Lilo & Stitch' has proven me wrong.  If anything, it manages to be even funnier than 'New Groove.'A hilarious script (about two Hawaiian siblings, a runaway genetic experiment, several aliens, a strange social worker and a surfer dude) combined with great voice acting (kudos especially to Ving Rhames as the wonderfully named Cobra Bubbles, and Zoe Caldwell as the Federation leader) make this a definite must-see.  Great songs (most by Elvis Presley) add to the chaos (and 'Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride' is superb)I rate this just below 'Spider-Man' and just above 'Star Wars Episode II.'Highly recommended!",10,1,1,23 June 2002
Gone with the Wind," An incredibly overrated slice of pure boredom!
","This is not a good film, folks.  Let's look past all the hype and hoopla and acknowledge that fact.Clark Gable didn't just phone in his role; he friggin' TELEGRAPHED it.  As the vastly irritating Scarlett O'Hara, Vivian Leigh tested the strength of my vow not to hit the 'Mute' button on my remote.The production values are decent, but that doesn't come close to compensating for a ridiculous script based on a ridiculous novel by Margaret Mitchell.If you want a TRUE epic, go watch 'The Godfather.'  If you want an example of how a big box office can vastly exaggerate the public view of a horrible film, watch 'Titanic' or this.",1,18,62,26 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Very good adaptation!
","I've read all four (to date) of J.K. Rowling's excellent HARRY POTTER novels.  As an 18-year old American college student, I'm far from the target audience for this movie, but I went to see it on opening day in hopes that it would live up to its source material.It did not disappoint.Practically everything onscreen was close to the way I'd imagined it in my head, and points go to the set designers.  Also, this is one movie where the SFX crew really were wizards.The actors all performed marvellously.  The standouts in my mind were Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and (surprisingly) Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood.The script was also excellent, hewing very close to the book.  A few scenes were removed or merged, but they affected the movie not a bit.I highly recommend this!",10,0,0,16 November 2001
The Matrix," Highly Overrated
","It's ridiculous that a film like this is in the top 250, much less the top 50.  This is a film with not a single redeeming value.  The special effects are really nothing to write home about, the plot has so many holes you could pilot a 747 through them, and Keanu Reeves gives his usual performance; that is, being outacted by the scenery.  I recommend watching this once, to truly appreciate how bad it is.",1,17,39,10 April 2001
