The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Beautifully Awkward
","I really liked the perks of being a wallflower. I loved that it was awkward, I loved that it was flawed. the details melted my heart, the silly moments, the almost kisses brought me back to high school. The glorious moments in the missed opportunities, and the mistakes made it all real for me. The heartache was genuine, the dreams were ideal and raw so yes i liked the perks of being a wild flower. Moreover, i liked that it was a coming of age movie. it was simple, not exaggerated, borderline real. The only thing i missed was the magic that connects me to the movies, just missed it barely but it just was not enough. I love movies but very few resonate with the romantic skeptic in me.",8,2,4,22 April 2013
Oblivion," Oh Movies
","Respect to the craft. they built a real spaceship (basically). Acting was great. Visuals divine. twist and turns i can appreciate. Let us agree there can only be one inception. Complicating a movie does automatically give it a certain level of sophistication. It is a predictable movie in many aspects, and the other half is simply confusing. It is not a movie that you are likely to think about twice, or remember throughout time. It has a story though, it has a cast. Nevertheless, as i usually say i am a big fan of 'find out yourself.' who knows for you it just might be your movie of the year. The main advantage i suppose is that it does indeed keep you guessing.",5,4,6,22 April 2013
