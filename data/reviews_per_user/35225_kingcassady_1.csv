The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Chilling, Beautiful, Intense, and repulsive...This Film is GENIUS.
","I had a lot of hope in this movie and last week when the reviews started to come out my enthusiasm went down loads as it was being trashed. In no way was Breaking Dawn my favorite book, that was definitely Twilight or Eclipse, but Bill Condon gave me hope and when I saw the reviews I lost a lot of faith in him. Now let me tell you I went into the theater extremely worried...IT WAS AMAZING. Now I still think Eclipse was the best one. But everything I loved about Twilight was in this. The awkward but cute Edward and Bella moments, the cinematography, and the whole entire set was great. The movie starts with Bella getting ready for her wedding and soon enough the time has come and she's speeding her way down the isle for Edward. The movie takes off to Isle Esme, which by the way was absolutely beautiful, and they repeatedly make out and have sex. Now this was what I considered the first half, and the worst half, of the movie. Not that it was bad but it could have been edited very much so. Although, I did enjoy that flashback scene of Edward at the movies...that was interesting. Now part 2 of the film is where I finally saw some awesome things. The acting was top-notch, never had I ever felt Bella that much. Edward was in-pain, but the scene where he hears Reneseme's thoughts was soo cute. And I loved all the wolf-pack stuff which I thought I'd hate, but some of the stuff was actually pretty neat. I LOVED the wolf pack scene where Jacob leaves the pack. It's really, really amazingly directed although the voices were kind of annoying. But it was the birth scene that had my stomach curling and it was when I officially realized how brilliant the movie really was. The way it made you feel, repulsive and sick, it was just perfect. And then the ending when Bella was transforming there may or may not of have been tears in my eyes. SO WONDERFUL. Overall, there were some flaws like the lack of Leah and Seth who were key parts to the novel. And I do think some of the wedding could have been cut out. I never liked Ashley Greene as Alice, but she did a terrible job in this film. Could not get myself to like her as Alice at all in this one. The movie was funny especially the cute toast scene, all the honey moon scenes were beautiful, the pregnant stuff was super intense, the wolf pack was finally just how I pictured it to be like, and finally the birth scene was just pure brilliance. Thank you Bill Condon. 8.5/10",Null,5,15,18 November 2011
