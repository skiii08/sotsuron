The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Amazingly moving movie
","I first wanted to see this movie, because Logan Lerman played the main character, but then I realized that this is an amazing movie. All of the actors did a great job playing in this movie. I think this is Logan Lerman's best movie ever. Emma Watson did really good as well, this character fitted her. This is an interesting movie for teenagers coping with hard life. Love, sex, cheating, it has almost everything in it that interests a teenage nowadays. The end was really moving, it made me cry. All in all, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, and it isn't the movie with the most cliffhangers and action in it, but it's definitely worth seeing.",8,0,0,1 July 2013
American Hustle," A Good Movie to Watch Once
","To tell you the truth, I only went to watch this movie in the cinemas because Jennifer Lawrence is my favourite actress, but I had doubts, if this film would be good, because usually films which have to many good actors in it end up being not so good at all. But this film wasn't so bad at all. It started out a bit boring, but by then end I couldn't wait what the end will be. All in all it was a very interesting film with quite a few sexual content but not too many to be rated plus. I haven't seen any other Christian Bale films, but I think I will watch more from now on, because he did a good job in this film. I've seen like three-four films from Amy Adams, but so far I've only seen her play the good girl, so this was a surprise from her. I think Bradley Cooper's and Jennifer Lawrence's character was sort of like what they always play, but they didn't act badly. Jennifer actually made me laugh a few times, I think she sort of lit up the movie. I admit i didn't look through the cast too closely this time, because when Robert DeNiro appeared in the middle of the film I was quite surprised, but after all his character was quite typical too. To sum up, it's a good movie to watch once, especially if you like these actors. It isn't bad, but isn't the best film I've ever seen either.",7,4,7,8 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Good movie of the book, not worse than other LotR movies
","Follows the book almost all the time. Peter Jackson put a little love story in it, while the book barely has any female characters at all. Orlando Bloom has a little place in it as well as Legolas, we can see a new Legolas, why he became what he was in the Lord of the Rings, why he hates dwarfs so much. Actors and actresses play well, Peter Jackson did a great job in directing this movie as well. Big LotR fans will love this movie as well, though some people might start to find this movie a bit long with a bit too much repeating throughout the movies. All of all I give it an eight. I like LotR and this was a great movie as well, recommend it to everyone, even if you haven't seen the Lord of the Rings itself, for after all the Hobbit is before the Lord of the Rings in time.",8,0,4,30 December 2013
Frozen," Funny and romantic, a perfect family movie
","I think Frozen is yet one of the best Disney-family movies. Though the main characters are girls, there are two boy characters in it as well. It tells us the typical love story every girl wants nowadays through the naive Anna, but shows us also what many teenagers fight with today through the story of the troubled Elsa, who's trying to find herself, but serve well as a good queen too. Though the story can make you cry at times, it's also funny, especially Olaf, the snowman's character, who makes a joke of everything. The actors have done a good job with their voices too, and the soundtrack is great, has many catchy songs. It is a very sweet story that shows you the importance of family, honesty, and love.",8,3,6,8 February 2014
