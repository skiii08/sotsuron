It," Believing is seeing
","The movie reminds me 'The Skeleton Key' which has the similar topic that only if you believe the existence of evil, the evil can hurt you. Although 'The Skeleton Key' only got 6.5 while IT got 7.7 on IMDb. The difference is very likely to come from the clown since it scares many adults. Clown hasn't been out of date yet proved by the last success from the American Horror Story Season four. The quirky smile on clown's face that terrifies people immediately made the beginning of IT impressive, especially when the victim is an adorable kid. No matter how the clown changes its appearance in front of different kids, it always came with a red balloon, suggesting evil is coming. The sign always reaches people quickly. Maybe next time you saw a red balloon on the street, the movie would pop out of your mind. However, other parts of the movie were average. Somebody says that IT will be a great show if you like Stranger thing. While as a Stranger thing fan, I feel the similarity only exist in external. Because unlike stranger thing, IT failed to build a convincing logic world and there are many unreasonable places. For example, so many kids are missing and only one parent cares. Or, the main character somehow made his friends searching for his brother at risk of dying. When they tried to kill the clown together, it weirdly became a cult movie where a bunch of kids turn their fear into violence. After that, they cut their hands to make the vow to kill the clown again if it came back and held hands in blood. Ironically, the next scene is two kids kissing in a beautiful grass field. The shift is too quick and odd.",6,1,2,8 November 2017
