Ford v Ferrari," Engaging Story, Thrilling Racing, Great Acting
","Ford is failing as a company and in a last ditch effort to drive sales back up, they decide to expand their racing division. Rather than spending years and untold millions perfecting their own racecars, they decide to buy out Ferrari, but all they get are manipulations and insults, starting the infamous rivalry between Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford II. In retaliation, Ford enlist the help of Carroll Shelby to build them a car that can blow Ferrari's out of the water. And so was born the GT40. But a racecar is only half of it, they need a driver too, and Shelby's choice in Ken Miles is too hard a sell for the Ford executives.So which suits better, Ford v Ferrari or Le Mans '66? Honestly there isn't much of a movie without either. The Ford/Ferrari rivalry is what drives the first half of the movie, while preparation for Le Mans is what drives the second half. Throughout it's more of a Ken Miles biopic. I guess 'Ken Miles: The True Story' wouldn't have sold many tickets though. And while Carroll Shelby does appear a lot, he's not explored as a character anywhere near as deeply as Ken Miles is. We don't learn anything about his home life, we don't get to see him wrestle with his demons, and the film's coda almost entirely revolves around Miles' affect on everyone around him.Ken Miles is the star of the movie, there's no doubt about that, and Christian Bale is unsurprisingly great in the role, slipping in like a chameleon, like he does with every character he plays. He's a down-on-his-luck auto-mechanic who can't even pay the bills, and despite his good connections in Shelby and his unmatched skill as a racing driver, his quick temper and difficulty to work with keeps him rooted in the amateur circuit. That is, of course, until Shelby gets the offer from Ford to give them the Le Mans win. It takes one failed year at the race for Shelby to convince the higher-ups at Ford that they need an expert driver who has hands-on experience with the GT40 in building and testing to really get them the win.Acting is fairly top-notch across the board, and it's hard to say Bale stole the show when almost everyone else keeps up so well. Matt Damon offers no surprises as Shelby, with his strongest scenes at the very end. Jon Bernthal gets a little shafted in the second half as Lee Iacocca, but he gets plenty of time to shine before then, particularly in the negotiations with Ferrari. Josh Lucas is deliciously punchable as Leo Beebe, the Ford suit put in charge of the racing division, who is portrayed here as having no clue about racing, is constantly against Ken Miles' involvement, and even costs him the win at the end in the name of a photo opportunity. Caitriona Balfe is great as Miles' wife, who takes no crap from her husband, and supports him wherever she can. Tracy Letts is also pretty good as the no-nonsense, stoic Henry Ford II, with his stand-out scene being in a GT40 prototype crying his eyes out. At first you think it's due to pure fear of the speeds he's experienced, but then you realise they're happy tears having restored faith in his racing project, and then they evolve again into sadness and regret that his father, Henry Ford senior, was no longer alive to experience such a pinnacle achievement in automotive machinery. It becomes a surprisingly emotive scene purely thanks to Letts' performance.Le Mans '66 also has merits in the technical department. It's like crack to a driving junkie, particularly anyone with even a passing interest in 60s sportscars or the racing scene. I've always had a passing interest in cars thanks to my mum and dad both being rally drivers in their younger years, so Le Mans '66 definitely struck a chord with me. The roar of the engines is palpable and infectious, and seeing all sorts of snazzy classic cars driving around was a delight. As I understand it a lot of the GT40s, Shelbys, and Ferraris, including 330 P3 and 275 GTB used in the movie were real, only employing CGI and dummies for crashes, giving the whole experience a feeling of authenticity.The only criticism I particularly have revolves around the film's coda, showing Ken Miles' death and the effect it had on some of the characters. It felt unnecessary and meant the film ended on a considerable downer. It would be like if Bohemian Rhapsody followed up the LiveAid performance with Freddie Mercury's death and the various members of Queen reacting to it. The ending of the Le Mans race was enough of a downer for Ken, having the victory stolen from him thanks to a technicality in a publicity stunt, and then the next scene they kill him off on a test track in front of his son. Sure, he died doing what he loved, but it felt like a bit too much of a one-two punch. Ending it just after the race as he graciously accepts second place would have sufficed. This is really more of a niggle and personal taste more than anything though. It might work for you.In all Le Mans '66 was an enjoyable cinema experience. It hit all the right notes for a casual car fan in myself, and I'm sure it'll hit them all for fanatics who lived through it like my parents. But for those without any interest in cars, there's still plenty here for you. The acting is fantastic, the story never lags, and the race sequences are thrilling from beginning to end. I give Le Mans '66 a solid 8/10.",8,1,3,18 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Somehow Manages to Surpass the Original
","So where could they possibly take the Blade Runner franchise after the one-and- done original? Even as 2049 began, I had no idea, but somehow it manages not only to build on the original, develop the story naturally, and evolve it's themes, but sometimes even surpasses them. Replicants have had a rocky history in the last thirty years, being prohibited and brought back gradually after a series of violent outbursts. The Tyrell corp was bought out, there was a blackout that wiped out electronic records across the globe, and even a famine.Sapper Morton benefited from the famine with his protein farm, living a secluded life away from the dystopian hustle-and-bustle of LA. Until the day K arrives to bring him in, unraveling a miracle impossible to believe that could shake the very foundations of human society if the truth ever got out. The single biggest theme of both the original and 2049 is what it means to be human, what it means to be alive, how to measure consciousness and sentience, and whether that offers certain rights or not. 2049 builds on that, introducing new concepts with the express purpose of exploring and extrapolating this theme further. K is stated outright from the very beginning that he is a replicant. It's important information as he plays into how he's treated, and how he thinks of himself. While he thinks for himself, he is programmed to obey, and yet that doesn't make him come across as any less human. He's still treated as a lesser-class citizen because of it though, the same way white supremacists treat black people, or Myanmar Buddhists treat the Rohingya. One party sees themselves as more important, as more real, and spit on those who they see as beneath them. K is at the bottom of the heap...to a point.Roger Deakins is Hollywood's biggest awards underdog. His work is simply astounding time and time again, and 2049 is no exception. Every frame is a canvas to him, as he paints glorious strokes of colour and composition. Every scene outside is grey and miserable, with snow falling peacefully around, and the streets covered in sludge. Everywhere looks like a miserable place to be, whether it's LA's slums, or the rubbish tip that is San Diego, or Morton's maggot farm that resembles a moonbase. The opening shots of the film show fields that stretch as far as the eye can see, bringing them into focus as warehouses, hangars, and industrial greenhouses. Wallace's headquarters tower above the iconic Tyrell pyramid, made of the wealthiest commodity; wood, while Deckard hides out in the irradiated wasteland of Las Vegas, bathed in red and orange hues.The acting is also top-notch as well, of course. Ryan Gosling has become famous for his unblinking stares, some of which speak volumes with little surface emotion, while some falls flat and just looks lazy. Having watched the movie, his lack of facial emoting makes sense. He's a replicant after all. Strictly speaking he doesn't, or at least shouldn't, have emotional responses. He's a blank slate stuck into the world to do one job and one job only. Thankfully the enthralling character arc allows Gosling some room to work, and the emotions he does realise are fully formed and fully empathising.A big mention goes to Harrison Ford as well, who's turned himself into a bit of a meme in his old age, reviving old franchises and lazing through every scene as if he doesn't really want to be there. 2049 is an exception to the rule. He doesn't go into this for the paycheck, he has a genuine interest in the film, it's source material, and the script that was written for it. He offers his best performance in years, without a doubt, and creates all the impact of the final scene all by himself. Ana de Armas is also really, really good as Joi, giving her a sense of humanity and sentience that quite literally brings her to life. The chemistry she and Gosling share is palpable and goes a long way to developing her role as a non-sexual companion. Sylvia Hoeks is menacing as Luv, Wallace's right-hand assistant. While she doesn't get quite as much meat to play around with, she does have her interesting moments tapping into what it means to be an artificial sentience. The way she treats Joi is heartbreaking, and her snarky posture makes her just as human as her protagonistic opposites.Jared Leto, Robin Wright, Edward James Olmos, Dave Bautista, Mackenzie Davis, Lennie James, Barkhad Abdi, and even a brief appearance from Sean Young all share varying levels of supporting roles, and all enhance the movie in their own little way. Whether it's Wright's subtle advances on K, Bautista's marvel at the miracle he witnessed decades ago, James' quick change of character when he realises K is a cop, or Leto's menacing philosophical musings, each of them make their mark on the movie in such a way that they'd be missed if they weren't there, whether they have two minutes of screen time or fifteen.Blade Runner 2049 has a hell of a lot going for it, from the way it balances nostalgia and self-referentialism to enhancing the story and themes of the original without retreading old ground is probably the best thing about it. But the story it tells and how it wants to tell it is executed to perfection. I have no doubt that in future, if I fancy watching Blade Runner, I'll choose 2049 over the original. Despite being slow and really quite long, it uses every moment to it's favour, building character and atmosphere perfectly. I give 2049 a 9/10, without hesitation. I already want to go to the cinema and watch it again.",9,2,5,10 October 2017
First Man," An Experience both Beautiful and Intense
","The movie opens with a dodgy flight test in an X-15. Armstrong is just a civilian pilot/engineer with a young family at home, and we're immediately thrust into a tight, claustrophobic cockpit with him as he breaches the atmosphere and struggles coming back down. It's simply impossible to describe with words how intense this opening scene is. It's largely devoid of musical soundtrack, instead filled with the rattling and creaking of the aircraft, and all camera angles are strictly from the viewpoint of the cockpit, and the limited visibility gained from within. The controls don't work, and his bouncing off the atmosphere has set him for an inescapable trajectory away from Earth. Strictly speaking there should be no tension here, as we know Armstrong comes out the other end just fine, and yet Chazelle manages to paint a scene so frightening and claustrophobic that the tension plays itself.After this visceral opening we get the fundamental emotional backbone to the whole film, introducing us to Armstrong's adorable yet terminally ill daughter. We've only seen this guy struggle in a high-atmosphere aircraft and come back to a family he obviously loves so much, and yet already you find yourself invested in this guy and his family tragedy. Nobody told me this was going to be a weepy movie! I didn't bring tissues! The death of Armstrong's daughter weighs heavily on him the entire movie. He withdraws emotionally, turning cold and distant, and every funeral after every failed mission reminds him of his daughter, and at the end we get the most beautiful payoff on the surface of the moon itself.Compounding this tragedy is the permeating threat of death and failure. The movie highlights a number of failed missions that resulted in Armstrong's friends dying around him, including the Apollo 1 mission. Every failure is not only reinforced as a necessity in Armstrong's dialogue, but also builds up how insanely dangerous this ambition truly was. Any mission could fail for any reason, and before you know it kids have lost their fathers, wives have lost their husbands, and the toll this takes on the families - and Armstrong himself - builds with each failure as well. Every mission enjoys the fruits of increased threat thanks to everything that came before.One of these failures is one of Armstrong's himself; the Gemini VIII mission, which was a test run for docking with the mothership after the landing. As I mentioned with the opening sequence, everyone knows that Armstrong makes it out alive, and yet the sequence is absolutely not lacking in tension. Again this is thanks to the claustrophobic nature of the filming, which puts the whole perspective on Armstrong. The endless, uncontrollable spinning, the dizziness and lack of coordination, the fighting off unconsciousness set by the increasing G-force, and just not knowing, in that moment, what's caused the problem and how to solve it, with only mere seconds to sort it all out before it's too late. It was really intense!The actual moon landing itself is done really well as well. You might think at this point in time that the novelty of standing on the moon has faded in the public imagination, yet First Man puts you firmly back into the mindset of how monumental this event was for the history of mankind. Once the Apollo reaches the moons orbit, the close-up shots of it from the peaky little windows are tantalising, and the landing itself is drawn out with every little detail and off-the-cuff problem solving, with a ticking clock in the fuel gauge adding even more tension to another scene that strictly shouldn't have any. But it doesn't stop with the landing. Armstrong starts to climb down the ladder and stops on the landers feet, just inches away from a whole new world. It really starts to sink in that this is completely uncharted territory. No-one has ever been anywhere like this. It's completely alien. That first step we all wait for is imminent and the ramifications of it are so unimaginably huge. Chazelle manages to craft the scene so expertly that it makes the act of exploration and discovery so much more meaningful than any sci-fi film could hope to achieve.On a more technical basis, the whole movie is made a grand success by it's soundtrack and sound design. The rattling and shaking of the pods is enough to set anxiety in anyone, and the rare cutaways to the external spacecraft are bathed in absolute silence, befitting the vacuum of space. The soundtrack is simply perfect as well, utilising alien and spacey sounds and synths (including Armstrong's personal favourite, the Theremin) to create music so atmospheric and ethereal, yet so unreal and pioneering. It builds up the emotional ramifications of everything; the significance for both mankind and Armstrong personally. And yet it also knows precisely when to cut out entirely and let the action speak for itself.Likewise the film is a feast visually. The movie is done almost purely from Armstrong's perspective, and every camera shot is used to reinforce this. I mentioned it above, but I'll mention it again; the viewpoints of the missions are primarily from inside the cockpits. There's almost no external footage of the spacecraft, and the few we get are either so close that we still feel like we're put in the thick of the action, or so monumental and beautiful, like the Apollo 11 launch as it reaches the clouds, and the Earth it's leaving behind.First Man was a truly incredible experience. This is not a generic movie about the moon landing. This is a look at the life of Neil Armstrong in the years building up to it It's about his sacrifices and triumphs, his struggles both intellectually and emotionally, that all culminates in that iconic moment. Once the credits rolled my cinema screening was left in a stunned silence. No-one moved from their seats for a good couple of minutes. The sheer power and intensity of this movie was just so much to take in. Absolutely beautiful from the get-go, I give it a fantastic 9/10.",9,0,1,23 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay would've been a rushed mess as one movie
","When it was first announced that Mockingjay was going to be split into  two movies, I gawked. It's one book. How can there possibly be enough  to fill two movies? It didn't help that my sister also found it weird,  having read the book. She couldn't see any obvious place for the split.  Despite what feels like everyone else on the internet is saying, I  actually support the split now. Mockingjay marks a massive tonal shift  in the franchise, so it would have been a bit jarring introducing this  tonal shift for the final movie, leaving you no time to settle into the  new status quo left from Catching Fire. The biggest reason for my  support though is how rushed everything would have been.  When a book is adapted into a movie, there are certain time constraints  to be taken into account. That inevitably means things are cut, which  leaves many fans unhappy with the final product. With Mockingjay they  decided to give it time to flesh out the characters; give everyone a  bit of limelight, expand on various elements in the book, and just  generally make sure it doesn't frenetically jump from scene to scene or  cut out important plot points. Having now scene Mockingjay Part 1, I  can't imagine it being compressed into half the running time without  sacrificing the emotional resonance or rushing through everything.  The emotional resonance is the big selling point of Mockingjay. For  some it might be seen as boring, drawn-out melodrama, but for me it  made Mockingjay a darker, more harrowing movie than the previous two,  which says a lot about a franchise hinging on a fight-to-the-death  between children in order to keep the tyrannical dictatorship in place.  Katniss has lost her district, lost Peeta, and now lives in hiding with  a group of rebels intent on overthrowing the Capitol. To not dwell on  how that affects her and the people around her would have been a  massive misstep. The franchise needed to slow down and focus on the  characters.  To say it's only half a movie is misinformation as well. It feels like  a complete movie, at least more complete than Catching Fire ever did.  As I mentioned, Peeta is kept prisoner by the Capitol, and he's being  used as a propaganda weapon in response to Katniss' propaganda by the  rebels. The whole plot of the movie is about this cat and mouse of  propaganda as the two opposing sides try to get an upper hand on the  people of Panem. The big final climax feels like the big final climax  of a story, bringing this cat and mouse to an end. It's final moments  are a resolution to the beginning and middle, and in that respect it  absolutely has all three acts. Of course it has a cliffhanger moment  right before the credits to segue into the next movie, but so did  Catching Fire (and Desolation of Smaug, and Fast & Furious 6, and every  Marvel movie etc. etc.)  Everything else ticks all the right boxes as well; the acting is  top-notch, especially from Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman  (with a little memoriam for him in the credits). The visuals are on the  nail. District 12 is now depicted in ruins, the CGI of the various  ships and futuristic cityscape of the Capitol is flawless. There was  also some fantastic use of CGI on Josh Hutcherson to make him look  progressively thinner and beaten up as the movie goes along, showing  the torture he must have been enduring. The musical score is fantastic,  with the Mockingjay theme coming well and truly into it's element, as  well as a fully fledged song that brings the rebellion to full strength  in the propaganda war.  Mockingjay proves that milking extra movies out of a franchise doesn't  necessarily have to be a bad thing (looking at you, Desolation of  Smaug). It slows the franchise down and gives you time to breathe  before the big conclusion next year, injecting plenty of heartfelt  emotion to the whole situation, fleshing out the world, developing the  characters etc. However it's not without it's higher-octane moments.  There's a number of action scenes despite it's calmer narrative, which  expand what was in the book to blistering effect (the fantastically  suspenseful climax is apparently just a few lines in the book, largely  glossed over). It's tense, unpredictable, emotional, yet has it's  light-hearted moments. I give Mockingjay Part 1 a very good 8/10. It's  made me very excited for next year when I can marathon the whole  franchise in one go.",8,65,144,22 November 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Rivitalised the Franchise, but Pales in Comparison to its Bond and Bourne Cousins
","In many ways, Mission: Impossible III laid the groundwork for what followed. It was in production in the height of Bourne revitalising the spy genre, around the same time as Casino Royale similarly breathed new life into Bond. It took the over-the-top action of II and grounded it into something a little more gritty and emotionally affecting. It put Ethan in the retired camp, wanting to settle down with a wife and dragged back in after the death of a former trainee. Unfortunately it pales in comparison to it's cousins, who did similar but simply better. In the microcosm of Mission: Impossible though, III was somewhat revolutionary, resurrecting a franchise many had thought dead after II wasn't quite as well received as anyone would have liked. And as I said, it laid the groundwork for what followed, and there's no denying how strong Rogue Nation and Fallout have been because of it. We simply wouldn't have those fantastic action movies without III.III carries the action focus on from II, but grounds it, and this is its greatest strength. As much as I love II, it's action scenes are over-the-top and cheesy, full of gadgetry and lacking in any intrigue. It's more like an old-school Bond movie than a Mission: Impossible movie. III brought Mission: Impossible back down, and it results in some fantastic action sequences. The opening factory rescue is stylish yet practical with lots of cool moments, and the team breaking into the Vatican to get at Davian is some of the most intriguing spy work in the entire franchise. Then there's the breakout on the bridge which throws around and batters Ethan more than ever before, not only showing his humanity as a hero, but also providing some really touch-and-go moments.But another of III's strength is in it's character work and world building. I mean it's still a Mission: Impossible film, and expecting something truly great in this regard is unrealistic, but it does add a hell of a lot not only to Ethan as a character, but the world he inhabits as well. We finally get to see inside the IMF, and all the cogs that make it tick, from tech analysts and medical examiners to a hierarchy of management and reference to trainers and trainees. It's not just Ethan being gifted mysterious exploding mission packages from a faceless spy organisation any more. Furthermore we get to see a more mature side of Ethan thanks to Julia, his wife-to-be, and the reason why he wants to retire. It goes a long way to add some very real stakes, as well as giving Tom Cruise something to really sink his teeth into.The opening interrogation sequence is almost pitch perfect in every way with how Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman bounce off one another. Ethan is desperate and powerless, attempting to reason with a different kind of ticking clock, and Davian is calm, cruel, and cold. Honestly the entire movie lies on how strong these two performances are. Cruise was never going to win any awards for this, obviously, but the performance he offers proves he can carry emotional beats as well as physical ones. Philip Seymour Hoffman though, steals the limelight. Davian honestly isn't all that an engaging villain on paper. He's an arms dealer who has connections he really shouldn't, and when sleighted, he takes what ultimately amounts to petty vengeance. However Hoffman manages to elevate the character off the page into a franchise-best villain. His delivery is calm and threatening, quietly aggressive until he needs to be more forceful. The way he threatens Ethan and everyone he loves while in a position to not really be making threats, with a cool and calm demeanour as if everything he says is just everyday language, gives him such a nasty edge that you love to hate. Davian turns from a lacklustre villain into a nasty, vindictive, unfeeling asshole all thanks to Hoffman's performance alone.But III isn't perfect, and as I said it lacks something that Bourne and Craig-era Bond manage to tap into. It's still kind of cheesy. The settling-down/romantic element of III is something I love about it in concept, and it changed up the tone of the franchise massively. And yet oft times it still feels like a sappy romance shoehorned in to a movie that is at odds with it. The happy-ever-after ending, with Ethan walking away hand-in-hand with Julia doesn't particularly help either. There's a reason why Vesper doesn't make it out of Casino Royale alive, and it's because our heroes are more interesting and engaging when they're not tied to a love interest. It's no surprise, of course, that Ghost Protocol (as far as I can remember - it's been a while) completely drops the whole thing as if it never happened.The other thing that bugs me, moreso now than it used to, is the cinematography. This is J.J. Abrams' feature directorial debut, and he brings his television sensibilities with him somewhat. His trademark lens flare dates back to this (and possibly before), and that coupled with the Bourne trend of shaky-cam results in some messy shots. There's also a lot of close-ups, which don't help the shaky-cam, but they do add a lot of intensity and emotional claustrophobia. But what gets me now is the colour-pallet, which still looks quite television-y. It's super bright and colourful with really sharp contrasts, and while it does give it its own visual identity, it doesn't always look that great. When Tom Cruise looks like he has jaundice, maybe you should consider adjusting the colour balance a bit.Don't get me wrong though, III is still a fine addition to the franchise, and it's probably safe to say that it was the best Mission: Impossible movie at the time. It showed a self-awareness that let you know it never takes itself too seriously, and knows exactly where it came from. It helps that there's a lot of great stuff here that's enough to overshadow the slightly irksome. Davian is simply delectable, and seeing Ethan hunt desperate and struggling really helped the franchise in the long-run. Really good action sequences helped too, of course. I give Mission: Impossible III an enjoyable 7/10, that has unfortunately been overshadowed by both its follow-ups and its cousins of the time, but is still pretty good in its own right, and it gave us Benji, so plus points there too.",7,1,1,2 August 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Intense from beginning to end
","Like everyone else, I was taken by complete surprise when the movie was announced less than two months ago with a trailer and everything. No-one knew it even existed until then, and it's sudden appearance brought on a whole host of questions. The film's ultimate lure was by not telling you anything, and remaining mysterious. That was enough for me to get more excited about this movie than that big blockbuster featuring one of my favourite characters released at the end of the week. Just a note on spoilers, I avoid spoiling anything as best I can, and make efforts to hide anything major, but you are warned that this movie is best enjoyed knowing nothing.10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie that encourages you to constantly question what you see and what you're told. It throws twists and turns at you from all angles, sometimes suddenly, out of the blue, to loud and shocking results. To say that 10 Cloverfield Lane is unpredictable is an understatement. Things just unexpectedly happen from the very offset, and you're never sure what or when something is going to happen next. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and off- balance. For as many questions as it poses, it makes sure all the major ones are answered by the movie's end. However the story's only real fault is with it's climax. Even when knowing about the movie's external context, and taking note of the hints and clues subtly laid out in the build up, the ending still comes off as a bit far-fetched. While it does play as a little ironic, it just feels completely out-of-place with the tone and direction of the rest of the film that precedes it.Being a movie that largely takes place in an underground bunker, it's entertainment value is entirely reliant on the dialogue and the acting work. Thankfully, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a massive success in both regards. Mary Elizabeth Winstead brings her A-game as Michelle. After a car accident, she finds herself chained to the wall of an underground bunker and told that the surface is unsafe due to chemical or nuclear attacks. Winstead plays her suitably suspicious and distrusting. She's even a little manipulative over her cohabiters to ensure she can not only find the truth, but also live to tell the tale. She often holds her suspicions and fears just beneath the surface. John Gallagher Jr. is also pretty good as Emmett, the other, younger guy in the bunker. He's not too sharp, but Gallagher doesn't play him as a complete idiot (you never go full retard). He's a funny guy with a soul and good heart, and his character brings a much needed lightheartedness to the otherwise claustrophobic and grim tone of the rest of the movie.However, even amongst such great performances from his co-stars, John Goodman shines like a shiny diamond. It's easy to forget how good an actor he really is, but 10 Cloverfield Lane is here to remind us. As Howard, the conspiracy nut who built the bunker. With a history in the Navy and working with satellites for a certain Japanese company, it's easy to understand where his conspiracy stance may stem from, and lays the seeds that he might actually be right. Besides, Goodman plays him like an older version of a thirty year-old who lives in his mum's basement. This gives him a creepy and anti-social persona that puts you on edge towards his true intentions. However he injects enough humanity and soul into the performance that Howard is more than just an antagonist. He's sympathetic enough that he could be genuine and just misunderstood. You feel Howard has a full and deep history just from Goodman's performance alone.Oh yeah, almost forgot, what's it's relation to Cloverfield? No idea. At this point with JJ Abrams, it's hard to tell if he's narratively connecting movies together, or just putting the same easter eggs and references into them for fun and to watch the internet explode. There's a strong theory supporting the subtle sequel idea, but there's also a few points that just fly in the face of any outright continuity. Ultimately, you'll just have to see it and judge for yourself, but either way 10 Cloverfield Lane stands perfectly fine by itself without relying on any other movie.I won't rattle on too long (I don't think I could without delving too much into spoiler territory), so I'll leave it there and keep it concise and short. It's a tense thriller that will plunge you into eternal suspense, driven by complex characters and spectacular performances. I give it a very good 8/10 (although subsequent rewatches may well bump it up a bit; it's a movie that begs to be watched more than once).",8,4,6,22 March 2016
War Dogs," Not a Comedy, but Still Entertaining
","War Dogs follows two young stoners as they weasel their way into the arms business and somehow manage to land a $300million military contract with the government, supplying guns, grenades, and ammunition to the Afghan army circa 2008. They find they have to cut a few corners and forge a few documents to make sure it all runs smoothly, which it does, until it doesn't. Based on a true story, a lot of the broader strokes are public record, but being a movie, certain events have naturally been added or embellished to make them a little more interesting (no-one wants to watch two stoners sat in front of their computers for two hours).First thing I have to note is that the marketing lies. It lies really hard in order to get your seat in the cinema. The way it does that is by painting a different movie to what you get. In some ways it's understandably easier to market this film as a comedy, especially when you emblazon Todd Phillips' and Jonah Hill's names all over it. There are light-hearted moments and the odd joke, but almost every humorous moment is packed into the trailers. War Dogs is a drama/thriller first. This isn't a criticism, I'm just trying to manage expectations. Don't go in expecting The Hangover with arms dealers, because that's not this movie.That said, War Dogs plays a lot like Wolf of Wall Street meets Lord of War (the latter of which the real Efraim Diveroli was apparently obsessed with at the time). Jonah Hill pretty much plays the same character he did in Wolf of Wall Street as well. War Dogs plays out as a fundamentally anti- war/anti-military movie though. That's the only message you can really take from it as it highlights how ridiculous the whole situation is. These are two stoner kids running Barettas through Iraq, to be greeted with stacks of Hussain's billions just sitting in a warehouse, paying for the US invasion. When they inevitably get busted for fraud, David Packouz suffers only seven months of house arrest, which is nothing. A patsy he may have been, but it hardly put a dent in his life considering how serious his crimes were, and that's because the military was willing to turn a blind eye to the Chinese ammunition they were being sold, because it fuelled their war for a discount price.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are pretty great though, even if they do just play to their typecasts. As I mentioned, Jonah Hill pretty much plays the same love-to-hate character he did in Wolf of Wall Street, only fatter, and ever so slightly more of a douchebag. He does it well though. Alarmingly well. His weight and his high-pitched laugh are used to comedic effect (if that's the kind of thing that amuses you, the group of lads sat behind me sniggered every time Hill laughed), and in a way to mock the real Diveroli, but largely holds no factual accuracy (Diveroli is actually quite well-built). Miles Teller plays his everyman out-of-depth character really well as well, with a beautiful young wife and baby daughter on the way providing him a motivation for getting into the business in the first place. Teller's Packouz is our character to root for, painted likable if slightly inept. Ultimately though, it all works because Teller and Hill share a fantastic chemistry that is both engaging and entertaining.War Dogs isn't a must-see movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's not particularly original, it's marketing was a massive misfire, and his underlying message is a little haphazard. That said I can't say I found myself bored at any point in the film's runtime. The acting and character work was done really well, and the story balanced out it's serious moments with light-hearted humour just enough without bowing into full-comedy mode. I give War Dogs a respectable 7/10",7,1,1,31 August 2016
Rocketman," Blows Bohemian Rhapsody Out of the Water
","The second Dexter Fletcher-directed biopic about huge British rock stars from the 70s and 80s. Bohemian Rhapsody is an award winning movie plagued by some big problems thanks to backstage drama, but still managed to maintain an interesting and entertaining story of one of the most tragic figures in modern music. Comparisons to that film are going to be hard to avoid, but in short Rocketman is by far the better of the two, and it's unfortunate that it'll likely get overlooked by its predecessor.Rocketman is less a run-of-the-mill biopic, and toes the line very closely to fantastical musical. Now anyone who knows me knows that I hate musicals with a passion. Disney gets a pass because they're animated and the cheesy nature of musicals fit right in with upbeat cartoons, but live-action musicals are just an exercise in cringe for me. Why have these people suddenly burst out into song and dance? Why is the story being told through lyrics and melodies? There's no feelings or emotions there other than happiness so they all come off as one-note and uncomfortable. But Rocketman is different. In Rocketman it works, suiting Elton John's eccentric personality and lifestyle. He dresses up in the craziest costumes, so why not go all the way with the eccentricities?This approach also ties the works of Elton John into the movie. Where Bohemian Rhapsody was as much about the creation of Queen's music as it was about Mercury's lifestyle, in Rocketman the music is what tells the story of Elton John and his lifestyle. His drug-fuelled binges are portrayed with the soulless highs of musical numbers with scene transitions you'd find on Broadway. There's one point in particular that has become one of my favourite scene transitions in cinema. Elton decides to drown himself in his pool at a party. At the bottom he sees his childhood self who starts to sing Rocketman. When people dive in to get him, they hover in the water above like dancers. He's pulled out of the pool, put on a stretcher, and taken to hospital, where's he gets a stomach pump and IV, is stripped of his clothes, and then redressed in a sparkling baseball uniform, doused in make-up, and pushed out onto a stage full of lights and instantly continues the song. It's not quite a one-take scene, but the transition from ambulance to stage is all done in one go without skipping a beat, showing how quickly he was pushed back into touring, and how little his self-destructive behaviour was addressed because of it. In some ways it frustrated me how this serious dramatic moment was glossed over and forgotten about, but that was the point. Elton was left in this state for too long, coasting from one show to the next, country to country, album to album, and he drowned out the days with drugs and alcohol, until he had no idea where he was or what he was doing. And this isn't the only moment seamless scene transitions are used to portray this lapse in memory.I'm not a particularly big fan of Elton John. I'm definitely more interested in him the character than his music, especially when compared to Bohemian Rhapsody and my over-familiarity with some of Queen's biggest hits. So I admit I didn't even know if half the songs were Elton John songs or not (I mean, why wouldn't they be?), but it was great hearing those I was familiar with. Rocketman, Your Song, I'm Still Standing, Saturday Nights Alright, and they were all integrated into the movie fantastically. Furthermore they were all performed by Taron Egerton himself who simultaneously doesn't try too hard to emulate Elton, and yet often sounds just like him. Dude's got a surprisingly killer voice! Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor also show real musical promise as younger versions of Elton as well.And while we're here I want to sing Egerton's praises even more, because goddamn this was the best performance of his life, and I would be disappointed (albeit unsurprised) if he didn't get award nominations at the end of the year. The movie's main focus on Elton's struggle with alcohol and drugs is sold almost purely on Egerton's performance. He manages to bring a humanity to Elton's trademark extravagance and iconic temper, and his emotional breakdowns are so real and relatable. The movie opens with him angrily strutting into rehab and starting his story with pursed lips and a deep resentment boiling under the surface. But it gives way to tears and a look of pure sadness and hopelessness on Egerton's face as he reflects on his loveless childhood, before holding back his vulnerability and bringing the rage back to the surface. In the first 5 minutes of the movie's runtime I was already sold, purely on Egerton's spectacular performance. He shows so much depth and emotional complexity without any signs of struggling whatsoever, and I found it hugely moving and powerful.But that's not to say the rest of the cast lag behind at all. Richard Madden is infuriatingly easy to hate as the manipulative a**hole of John Reid. He slips into that villainous role so easily that it's easy to forget he was ever Robb Stark. Bryce Dallas Howard as Elton's no-nonsense mother was also great in her vapidity and lack of affection for her own son, and her accent was so accurate that I almost didn't recognise it was her at all. Finally, an American who can do a decent British accent! Jamie Bell keeps a cool and calm demeanour throughout as Elton's best friend of fifty years, and co-writer of many of his songs; Bernie. Stephen Graham is great as the eventually won-over Dick James who started Elton on his career trajectory, edging so close to asshole without going all the way and actually being oddly likeable despite his limited screen time.And yet despite all these paragraphs I still haven't managed to talk about what I really want to, and that's how heartbreaking Rocketman's story actually is. This is another way in which it marks its own identity against Bohemian Rhapsody, as it shows Elton's descent into drugs and alcohol brilliantly, and ascribes it to a hopeless and loveless life. He got no love from his father, his mother was distant affectionately, and every love interest he had spurned and betrayed him. He had success, fame, and money, and yet it took decades for him to get what he needed all along; love. By the end of the movie he eventually finds it in the form of self-love, accepting who he is for who he is and not for who those around him want him to be. He gives his childhood self the hug he always needed in one of the film's most heartwarming and powerful moments. The comeback of the film's final moments are more powerful than the admittedly fantastic LiveAid scene because it feels more well-earned. We saw Elton go almost as low as a human can, so to see him stand back up, confront the ghosts of his past, and accept himself felt cathartic and inspirational.If I had a criticism it would be the glossing over his marriage to Renate, something that wasn't particularly well-developed, felt like it came out of nowhere, and was over and forgotten about five minutes later. It felt like a fairly important and crucial part of Elton's story, but like it was only included to tick the box off rather than to actually add anything to movie's story. Personally I thought it could've really added something, and was definitely an aspect I'd have liked to have seen. The only other criticism that springs to mind was the claim of Elton and Bernie not having had an argument in twenty years, which if accurate means either the drama between them in the movie was fabricated, or that it was a liberal use of what an argument is. But that last criticism is super nitpicky, and by no means has any impact on how good or bad the movie was.Rocketman is nothing short of a triumphant success. The writing is really good, effortlessly blending Elton's songs into his life as if they were written specifically for the purpose of the movie. The score and soundtrack become indistinguishable. Egerton's performance was simply spectacular in every way and he is quickly rising up to being one of my favourite actors. The story is heartbreaking and difficult, but important and inspirational all in the same beat. I give Rocketman a really good 8/10. Honestly I want to give it more, and a rewatch would probably earn that, but my personal conflicts with musicals still gets in the way a little bit. But take my word for it, Rocketman is worth every minute and every penny.",8,2,4,29 May 2019
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Comedy Masterpiece that Couldn't be Made Today
","This was the very last VHS I ever got, and I've loved it ever since. In celebration of the recently late Terry Jones, we decided to revisit it, and honestly didn't even realise he directed it until the opening credits. It was also the perfect opportunity to educate my wife who had never seen it before, and I couldn't abide that. For those of you similarly uneducated on one of the greatest comedy movies of all time, Life of Brian follows a man born on the same day and next door to Jesus Christ. Thirty-three years later he discovers he has Roman ancestry, joins an anti-Roman movement, and gets mistaken for the Messiah. And not once does it take the piss out of Jesus.Ironically enough considering the controversy, Life of Brian is a satire of blind faith and religion itself. Nothing encapsulates this better than when Brian loses his sandal while being chased by a group of rabid followers. The followers stop to consider the sandal and what Brian leaving it behind is meant to mean. There's disagreements as to the significance and the group of followers quickly splinter by their differing interpretations. When they finally catch up with Brian he tells them to go away, and the followers take it as profound wisdom to go away in a certain way in order to attain spiritual cleansing. When there's complaints of no food, Brian points out a bush of fruit a hundred yards away and it's instantly hailed as a miracle, and when the guy who's been using that bush to sustain him for eighteen years complains, he's branded a blasphemour. And this goes on throughout the movie, including the famous nude scene with such iconic gems as 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy' and 'We are all individuals! I'm not.'The genius of Life of Brian is how multilayered the jokes are, and how relentless they become the deeper your understanding of them is. On the surface there's plenty of comedy to be found, from the slapstick (Brian falling on a preacher, pushing him into a large jar) to the surrealist (Brian being abducted by aliens). Then there's the wordplay with Pontius Pilate talking about his friend Biggus Dickus and his inability to pronounce Rs, and the splintered revolutionary factions battling it out in the Roman corridors. Dig deeper and there's the satirical look at religious followers I explained above. But then there's even more, such as the grammar-lesson in Latin, which I can imagine develops a whole new level of comedy for those who actually know a little bit of how Latin works. Even if you don't, the scene is brimming with other humour in the Roman soldiery taking the time to teach a Jew Latin grammar, and giving him school-age punishment of writing it out a hundred times.I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Life of Brian could not be made today. For starters the controversy it garnered at the time would only be amplified in today's internet age of Twitter complainers. Movies today are so frightened of alienating particular audiences that even the most risquÃ© comedies have a line to draw. Not only that but we don't have George Harrison to mortgage his house in order to finance the movie any more. But even further, Life of Brian has not aged well. This is largely a good thing as it adds a dash of shock and becomes refreshing to watch today, but there are certain jokes and moments that would not land very well at all. The one that jumped out to me immediately is Eric Idle's blackface in the opening scene. Unlike Tropic Thunder, the blackface isn't treated as a joke, they just painted Idle's face black to turn him into a black wise man. Another one (again the subject of Eric Idle) is Stan wanting to be a woman called Loretta, and the response he receives from his friends is blatant transphobia. The film doesn't have particularly great treatment of women either. Of all the female characters in the movie, only three of them were played by actual women. The most obvious is Terry Jones as Brian's mother, but the stoning scene becomes unintentionally ironic when you realise it's a bunch of men pretending to be women pretending to be men. Nonetheless, it's to be expected from a comedy troupe comprised entirely of white men.That aside, Life of Brian is a comedy masterpiece. The questionable acting doesn't matter, the repeated sets don't matter, the complete blindness to political correctness doesn't matter. All that matters is how hilarious it is, and Life of Brian is one of the absolute funniest. It doesn't matter how many times you rewatch it, there's always something new, another layer to the joke to appreciate, and the shallower jokes are so good and timeless that they're easily enjoyed for what they are over and over again. There's a reason Life of Brian is a landmark in pop culture, still quoted, referenced, and homaged today. It deserves nothing less than a 9/10.",9,0,2,27 January 2020
The Death of Stalin," The Thick of It, but in Soviet Russia
","The Death of Stalin has all of Iannucci's hallmarks of both dark comedy and political satire weaved through an otherwise quite serious story. Stalin is dead (spoilers), and the vacuum of power he leaves behind is ripe for the taking. But Russian authority doesn't work the same as it does anywhere else. It's crueller and less forgiving, and as such Iannucci has an entire playground of backstabbing and scheming characters to work with. He's able to twist fear and paranoia into pure humour and hilarity.The film opens with a mysterious phone call from Stalin's staff to a radio station, and the utter dread and confusion it instills in those that work at the radio station is equal parts hilarious and terrifying. After this introduction, we kick off with Stalin's council dividing and scheming behind each others backs. Death camp lists are drawn and redrawn, Stalin's children are manipulated and moved like pawns on a chessboard, and Stalin's own estate and staff are stripped and discarded like waste. And yet amidst the bleak cruelty and the cast of immensely dislikable characters, jokes are found fast and often, poking fun at it all and ultimately painting everyone involved as an idiot. Malenkov is a spineless coward, Molotov is so paranoid of retribution that he continues to lambast his wife after she's found innocent of treason, Mikoyan and Bulganin pretty much just go along with whoever shouts the loudest, Khrushchev can't seem to see any of his plans to success, Zhukov is just the muscle that doesn't give a crap, and Vasily is so drunk all the time that he doesn't even know what he's saying.The humour here is almost always black, even if just by virtue of being humour interspersed in a dark, violent story full of executions, death camps, and political intrigue. But beyond that, some of the jokes are just inherently black by nature, such as Molotov talking about his wife's treason for instance, or guards refusing to check on Stalin through fear of being killed. Many of the jokes find lighter footing though, such as Zhukov teasing Khrushchev when approached with helping to take down Beria, or Vasily attempting to wrestle a gun from his bodyguard while everyone else just stands there watching with bored or unimpressed expressions, or even the council consistently kneeling in a puddle of piss.And yet the humour never undermines it's more serious moments. There's barely a joke to be found in the film's final scenes when all the scheming pays off and a new regime is founded, sequences of people being rounded up and sent for torture or execution is as bleak as it sounds, and the closing credits are almost haunting in their mirroring of Russian treatment of history.As such all the actors involve do a great job of tackling both the dramatic and comedic aspects of their roles. Jason Isaacs is undoubtedly the standout when it comes to humour, utilising a Yorkshire accent to really give Zhukov the carefree attitude that makes him so entertaining. Simon Russell Beale on the other hand gives us a properly conniving villain who's repulsive to the core. He makes Beria oh so easy to hate. Michael Palin, Steve Buscemi, and Jeffrey Tambor manage to straddle the careful tightrope between likeable enough to laugh at, but unlikeable enough to befit their characters. If I had to pick a weak link it would probably be Andrea Riseborough, but I kind of feel that's unfair as I'm not a fan of her as it is. I found her Svetlana more of an annoyance than anything. Even Olga Kurylenko offered a performance more interesting and engaging.The Death of Stalin was pretty much exactly what I wanted. It finds humour in all the best places, and fills the movie to the brim with quotable lines and memorable moments that'll have me chuckling to myself for weeks. At the same time it doesn't shy away from it's dark subject matter, using it as framing for the idiocy the film pokes at. It pretty much is The Thick of It, but in Soviet Russia. If there's one thing that didn't quite work for me, it's how little flow there is between the light and the dark. Three Billboards did the serious/humourous really well, changing with the click of the fingers in the middle of its scenes, but The Death of Stalin gives you scenes gut-wrenching and horrible to contemplate, and then expects you to laugh in the next scene. It's not a big criticism, but I felt the balance could've been a little better. Regardless, I give the movie a solid 8/10, and would recommend it to any fans of political satire or black comedy (or both, I guess).",8,5,8,19 April 2018
Fury," Doesn't always work, and yet still very enjoyable.
","Fury is a war movie with many war movie tropes and clichÃ©s. The cast of characters, for example, is one big clichÃ©; there's the hardened veteran who's respected by everyone he commands, the Christian guy who keeps spouting bible verses, the bulldog who is so brimming with testosterone that he almost becomes a parody of himself, the Mexican who keeps getting told off for speaking Spanish, and of course the new recruit that they all bully until he proves himself worthy of their respect. So it's interesting that the movie decides to take a character-driven approach seeing as all the main characters are shallow stereotypes. Fortunately it kind of works in being a vehicle for the movie's themes.The biggest theme of the whole movie is certainly anti-war. It shows the brutality of it in all it's gory and psychological glory. It's a heavy movie to watch, both visually and emotionally, and that cast of characters are what helps push this along. But first the gore and violence. I mean, it's a war movie, this level of violence comes with the territory, however I'm shocked this got such a low rating (15 in the UK). The new recruit's first task is to clean up the mess of the guy he's replacing, whereupon he finds half the guy's face splat on the wall. The journey to his first mission ends up with their lieutenant getting set on fire and ultimately shooting himself in the head to make the pain stop. Yeah, this isn't a movie for the light-stomached.But back to the character focus and how it aids the themes. While the movie might be visually challenging to watch thanks to all the gore and violence, it's also hard to watch because of the emotions and psychology at play. It's these emotional situations that really lift the characters out of their pigeon-holed stereotypes. Again, focussing on the new recruit who was never trained with a weapon or how to kill, he struggles to kill the German soldiers. Taking a life is taking a life even if it is a you-or-me situation, and he's adamant to keep his conscious clean. He's also bullied on by the other members of his crew because of his 'weak' mental state, when in actual fact it's them who have grown apathetic and desensitised to the horrors of war.The acting is the single-biggest driving factor of the movie. The characters may be weak, the plot simple, and the themes and ideas mishandled, but the sheer quality of acting on display makes sure that you never really notice how weak the characters are. Each and every actor shares a great chemistry with his fellows that instantly lends to these four guys having been together as long as they claim. Each one also manages to individually add a surprising depth to their otherwise two-dimensional characters. Brad Pitt's Don is indeed the hardened veteran he's made out to be, wise and commanding respect wherever he goes even though he's not the highest ranking soldier. However he is also a bully, running Norman hard and against his ideologies. But he's human as well. He's respected because he's a nice guy deep down and he's committed to his cause. A two-dimensional character he is not.Every major character is given this same amount of depth by their actor. Logan Lerman's Norman may be the weedy greenhorn, but he's not a pushover nor is he socially challenged. He often goes toe-to-toe with the other members of his crew, giving as much as he takes, in defence of his stance. Shia LaBeouf's Bible (the Christian, if you couldn't tell) isn't your regular goody two- shoes that type of character is often portrayed as. He doesn't join in with the bullying as much, but he doesn't do anything to stop it, and in fact sides with his crewmembers even when they're being unreasonable. Of all the crew though, he's the one who gets most attached, so whenever another crew member dies, he's the one to add that emotional weight. I don't care what anyone says, LaBeouf is an astounding actor that deserves more credit - personal life be screwed. Jon Bernthal's animalistic Grady is every bit as macho (and slightly dumb) as his stereotype requires, but is again still human. He never quite reaches into parody land, and his short heart-to-heart with Norman near the end goes a long way to show that he's not just a brute. Michael PeÃ±a unfortunately gets the short end of the stick with the under-developed Gordo. Much like his Mexican stereotype, that's about all that's particularly memorable about him, and other than straggling the line between Bible's good nature and Grady's masculinity like a happy medium, he doesn't have a particularly well-carved out role within the crew (other than being the driver).Fury is a suspense-filled, nail-biting war movie that will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. It's the first movie I've seen that gives proper credit to the armoured regiments and this alone makes it stand out from the sea of WWII movies that are out there. The characters are weak, but the fantastic acting gives them the added dimensions they need, and the messages and themes are good and come across really well, but they sometimes become a detriment to the overall movie. Critically, Fury is a movie with many faults deserving of no more than a 'good' 7/10, although I personally enjoyed it enough to maybe have rated it higher.",7,2,6,28 October 2014
Darkest Hour," Entertaining Propaganda
","Darkest Hour follows the polarising figure for his first month in office, taking over from the recently ousted Neville Chamberlain (a figure I feel history will forever be unkind to), through the evacuation of Dunkirk. Much like many biopics of figures in positions of authority, Darkest Hour absolutely takes historic liberties in order to tell an engaging story worthy of a movie. Churchill is only ever painted as a likeable and sympathetic figure, full of rousing speeches, and moments of self-doubt in the most troubling of times, glossing over his more questionable ethics in regards to race, eugenics, and the British Empire. In fact the film flirts with pure fantasy in order to cover up these more detestable aspects of his character, at one point having him talk to a black man, something that he would never have done, nor would he have taken political advice from a number of women and children. So in many ways, Darkest Hour reads like revisionist propaganda, propping up a man already revered by the right-wing as a wartime hero.Much of the movie is tightly written and directed, really only losing steam in its final act. The sheer desperation and darkness endured by Britain at that time is palpable as we get a privy look into the War Chamber. Churchill was against the odds in trying to bring back British soldiers from Dunkirk, not appear weak or appease the Germans, keep his position of leadership intact against his own party, and stay financially afloat without the aristocracy of his peers. There's one particularly telling moment when Churchill contacts Roosevelt hoping to get an assistance from our American allies, to the point of near begging, only be told the most that can be done is to retrieve planes by dragging them across the Canadian border by horseback. 'Late in more ways than you can possibly know.'However the final act loses its way with Churchill going AWOL to talk to the British public on the London Tube. Churchill was known for going AWOL and gauging public opinion by talking directly to them on the streets of London, but this scene is entirely fictionalised and takes gross liberties with Churchill's character. But above all it ruins the film's pacing, slowing it down to a near halt for an overlong sequence full of cheesy dialogue and inspirational solidarity that plays off as pure propaganda. There were much better, cleaner ways of tying up this particular plot point, without resorting to something so painfully cringeworthy it almost ruins the entire movie.Gary Oldman's performance as Churchill was really good though, there's no doubt about that. Between the extensive make-up work and the complete adoption of Churchill's mannerisms, Oldman gets lost in the role entirely. I'm not entirely convinced it was an award-winning performance, but there's no doubt that the dude has an unmatched talent in playing real-life figures. Kristin Scott Thomas was also really good as Churchill's wife, posing as the emotional backbone to their family dynamic, and emphasising how difficult he was to work with. Lily James was unfortunately misused as his secretary though. She lacks any kind of character or personality, and instead just acts as a walking receptor for Churchill's more sympathetic and brooding moments. Ben Mendelsohn was really good as King George VI, and it was great seeing him in the role of a good guy for once, proving that he has an untapped acting range, beyond always just being the slimy antagonist. The scenes he and Oldman share together are some of the film's greatest highlights.On a more technical level, the film was also a success. The music by Dario Marianelli is unsurprisingly on point. It's a fairly typical orchestral score you'd expect to hear in a biopic, but it evokes the kind of music that works for these kinds of stories, ramping up the tension with beating drums, and the emotional stakes with sweeping strings, tied together with ever arpeggiating piano lines. The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel was also fantastic as well, offering more creative camerawork than I'd expected. The washed-out House of Commons was a nice touch bringing the film close to its black-and-white era, while imaginative shots like a POV shot from a child looking through his fingers like a telescope, German bombing of French lands seamlessly transitioning into the face of a corpse, and Churchill traveling in his elevator surrounded by a void of black space to show his isolation in his own cabinet, were enough to set the film apart from its contemporaries.Darkest Hour was the perfect choice for VE Day celebrations, but I have to question it's unrelentingly positive portrayal of Churchill. He's hailed as a British hero, and this film only exemplifies that by ignoring his more unsavoury characteristics. He was the perfect leader for wartime, but fairly diabolical as a democratic leader of a peacetime society. The film doesn't care about that, and honestly I can't blame it because that's not the point of the movie. This is about the beginning of his tenure and his successful evacuation of Dunkirk, no more, no less. The acting talent is great, but the whole thing is just a vehicle for Oldman to get his long-awaited Oscar, and the visuals were definitely a pleasant surprise. I give Darkest Hour a respectable 7/10. Just skip the god-awful Tube scene.",7,0,0,9 May 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," This is How you Star Wars
","Rogue One primarily follows a band of Rebels as they learn of and attempt to steal the plans of the infamous Death Star. Narratively, it could be argued that Rogue One's primary directive was to answer the unanswered questions of A New Hope and fill in the biggest plot hole in the entire saga, but the end product plays out more like a bridge than a prequel or a sequel one way or the other. Either way, it marks the first Star Wars movie not to feature a Skywalker; not to follow the main Jedi v Sith saga, and focus instead on the story around them; the Rebels vs the Empire. This is a movie about the little guys who won't be remembered in the history books of the Star Wars universe, rather than the legends who would form the myths and change the universe around them for centuries.One thing Rogue One is rife with is references to other movies and cameos from various characters. Crucially though, none of it feels unnatural. Every reference and every cameo feels necessary. Well, apart from maybe 3PO and R2D2 making a brief appearance. If nothing else, Rogue One proves that nostalgia in tentpole blockbusters can really work both narratively as well as financially. In truth, a lot of scenes would feel odd without them. As chronology places Rogue One a matter of days, or even hours before A New Hope, the absence of certain characters would've been jarring.Chief among them being Grand Moff Tarkin, who I didn't expect to see at all. Thing is though, Peter Cushing, the actor who played him originally, has been dead for over twenty years. If I hadn't known that, I wouldn't have noticed his recreation for the movie at all, and for the sake of continuity it was a risky yet fantastic choice. Sure, they could've recast him like they did Mon Mothma, but let's be honest, it would've been a harder sell. Instead they've brought in Guy Henry, who manages to capture Cushing's authority over the screen masterfully, and given him a CGI facemask that is almost uncanny in it's representation of the late actor. There have been many attempts over the years to bring back dead actors, or at least make them look younger, but Rogue One is the first to truly surpass the 'uncanny valley'. Visual Effects contender at the awards? Almost certainly.Acting was pretty great by all. I won't repeat what I said about Guy Henry's part in the resurrection of Peter Cushing, but it was arguably the most convincing and impressive performance of the movie. Felicity Jones proves that she is absolutely on the up-and-up and will only earn more recognition from Rogue One. Diego Luna was maybe a bit of a weak link, but certainly not movie-breaking (cough Christensen cough). Ben Mendelsohn does what he does best in creating a threatening and engaging villain who isn't without flawed personality traits of his own (a confrontation with Darth Vader is one of the movie's high points). Alan Tudyk steals the show as K-2SO, a sarcastic, deadpan Imperial droid who provides the most comic relief, while Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang make a great double team of believer and sceptic respectively. Mads Mikkelson frankly doesn't get enough to work with, and Jimmy Smits (as Senator Bail Organa) and Genevieve O'Reilly (as Mon Mothma) reprise their Episode III roles as little more than frequent cameos.While character development may arguably be a little lacking in Rogue One, there's enough for the viewer to get a sense of who each of them are amidst the snowballing plot, that doesn't particularly allow for a lot of downtime. Rogue One's real strength with it's characters, especially in contrast to the main saga, is that there is no good or bad, just various shades of grey. It's a world of doing what's necessary, no matter what. Cassian kills an informant early on with little emotion, maybe to save him from the torture of the Empire, or maybe just to save his own skin. Galen Erso metaphorically sleeps with the enemy in order to keep a daughter he hasn't seen in fifteen years relatively safe. Saw Gerrera's disruption of the Empire borders on terrorism. Jyn is, herself, a criminal for reasons unknown, and initially uninterested in the political conflict she's found herself thrust into. Of course Director Krennic is villainous to the core, and Chirrut is righteously heroic, proving that there's still room in the muddle of greys for some black and white.If I have one disappointment, it's the music. Michael Giacchino's score is great, don't get me wrong, but the most memorable beats in the movie were definitely the original themes written by John Williams. Giacchino's score reworks some of them, and attempts to create some new, but they pale in comparison. Not only that, but the main trailer for Rogue One had solid scoring that I'm disappointed didn't make it into the final cut (it's like Age of Ultron all over again). Overall though, this is just a minor niggle.Rogue One is, for me, quintessential Star Wars. Not only that, it builds on and improves it's surrounding movies in the saga. I'm not quite sure it's better than Revenge of the Sith in my personal ranking, but it's definitely up there alongside Empire Strikes Back as one of the best Star Wars movies ever made. It is consciously more Original Trilogy than it is Prequel, without completely ignoring what came before it. It taps into what made Star Wars beloved by many for decades without feeling like a retread like Force Awakens did. For this, I'm going to go with my gut rather than try and keep my feelings reserved, and give Rogue One a fantastic 9/10. I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end, and it's all I ever wanted from a new Star Wars movie.",9,2,5,16 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Another Notch in Marvel's High Averages
","As much as I love Marvel movies, their single-character movies can feel a little dull and uninteresting in comparison to the big tentpoles. Sure, seeing Nick Fury with two eyes and hair in the 90s was something to look forward to, but without a prior connection to Captain Marvel herself, it was hard for me to get uncomfortably overhyped.And in some ways Captain Marvel is a victim of Marvel's single-character movies. We've come so far into the franchise now that going back to see the origin of yet another hero and how/why they're relevant just doesn't seem as enthralling any more. That said, Marvel's molasses of average movies is still pretty damn high, especially when compared to other blockbusters and franchises around at the moment, and Captain Marvel is also no exception there. There's very little to hate.Vers is a Kree warrior with the unusual ability to shoot photon blasts from her fists. She's wrapped up in the Skrull/Kree war (the Skrulls being a race of shapeshifters), but is haunted of dreams of another life. While by the strictest definition, Captain Marvel is not an origin story, it still kind of is. While she has her powers from the movie's opening, it's still about her discovering who she is and what she's really capable of. Instead of starting at the beginning of her journey, her origin is instead told in flashbacks that are slowly revealed, expanded upon, and explained as the movie goes on. It's a good way of establishing her origin, and crafting a story around it, while also tying it into her character development as the movie goes along. It creates twists and turns that you don't see coming, re-ordering the general structure of a typical origin story. And I like anything that's different and changes things up, so thumbs up there.Unfortunately Captain Marvel herself is outshone by almost every other character in the movie. Yes, her determination and quest for answers are charming and carry the entire movie, but it's characters like a younger, more cheerful Nick Fury and an endearingly comical Talos who are responsible for making the movie as captivating to watch as it is. Samuel L Jackson is clearly having a lot of fun here, and like every one of his roles, he gives it his all, including being able to act like a guy in his forties instead of his seventies. The phenomenal make-up and CG to make him look younger were only one ingredient in how convincingly younger he appeared. Ben Mendelsohn honestly kind of steals the show as the Skrull leader, managing to carefully toe the line between menacing and goofy. They lean in to how potentially silly green, pointy-eared aliens who can shapeshift are, and use that to poke fun, while also not diminishing how deadly their abilities can be. Mendelsohn shows once again how capable an actor he really is.Talking of the humour, this is the freshest it's been in a while. Not once did it undercut more dramatic moments, feel forced in, or just be too much for its own good. Brie Larson's comedy bone comes out full force, and while she doesn't quite manage to encapsulate the jokiness of Tony Stark, she's pretty close. Another movie or two and she'll ease right into it. Another big source of comedy is the interactions between humans and aliens, and their worlds and cultures colliding. Goose the Flerken is a big example of this; adorable kitty cat? Or dangerous and unpredictable monster? Both outcomes are hilarious.Marvel has never been particularly great with their music, and Captain Marvel attempts to eschew that in the same way Guardians did, but without the same panazz. We get a whole album's worth of female-led 90's classics, from No Doubt and Garbage to TLC and Salt-N-Pepa. They do give the film's it own sonic identity and harkens back to the era, however some of the uses, particularly in the third act, feel misplaced. Come As You Are by Nirvana is used at one point, and lyrically it fits quite well with what's going on, but musically it comes out of nowhere and doesn't match the tone of the surrounding scenes whatsoever. Just A Girl by No Doubt is also a far cry from action scene music, and yet there it is bursting in over the top of a critical sequence of Captain Marvel kicking names and taking ass.Captain Marvel is by no means a bad movie. As a blockbuster goes it's one of the best you can get, but as a Marvel movie - thanks to the high quality across the board - it falls somewhere in the middle. It's nowhere near as good as Infinity War, Guardians, Winter Soldier, or Civil War, but it's also nowhere near as bad as Thor 2 or Iron Man 3. As far as female-lead superhero movies, I'd say Captain Marvel absolutely beats out Wonder Woman. I give it a flawed 8/10.P.S. I still think Danver's Ms. Marvel costume had the far superior colour scheme, and I wish they'd kept it. Black and gold with a red sash is unique in the superhero sphere. Instead they doubled down on her mediocrity by making her red and blue just like everyone else. The leotard and prostitute boots were too much, I agree, but that colour scheme (and the sash) was just too good to completely abandon. They even cycle through the black and gold scheme on her Kree uniform and it looks SO GOOD. Why tease me Marvel? Why?",8,1,2,12 March 2019
Passengers," Offers a Controversial Ethical Dilemma
","Passengers follows the 120-year trip of the spacecraft Avalon to an off-world colony, carrying over five thousand passengers looking to start a new life. Unfortunately something goes wrong along the way and Jim is woken up from hibernation early - ninety years early. He finds himself alone on a luxury cruiser where his travel bracelet will only allow him basic amenities, with only an android barman for company. Slightly spoilerish, but I will be discussing at length: After a year of painful loneliness, Jim discovers Aurora's pod, is captivated by her beauty, watches her boarding logs and reads her books and falls into an obsessive infatuation that leads him, out of desperation, to decide to wake her up and condemn her to spending the rest of her life aboard the Avalon, just like him.It's this moral and ethical dilemma that drives the film's most interesting premise, and is the most controversial part of the film that has people and critics up in arms. To me, this is where the film's biggest strength lies. It turns Jim from a charming and likable chap into something a bit more grey and murky. The film posits to it's audience; what would you do in his situation? There's no denying it's an awful choice to make, to condemn someone to your fate. It's far more noble to suffer the malfunction by yourself rather than drag someone down with you. But if you were in that situation, facing complete loneliness without any human contact for the rest of your life? Everyone would be tempted, and most I'd gladly wager would come to the same conclusion as Jim.The movie's third act moves this ethical foundation to the sidelines in favour of a more bombastic climax, as Jim and Aurora discover that the ship's problems extend much further than just some malfunctioning hibernation pods, and the lives of the other five thousand crew and passengers are at stake. From a narrative standpoint, the third act does little than to add a bit more excitement for more attention-deficient viewers, and unite Jim and Aurora to lead to a more bittersweet close. If I was directing this movie, there are probably a few different avenues I'd have liked to have attempted that would've changed the tone of the film a little more. It was a premise rife for a mystery. Say, if it opened with Aurora waking up and being greeted by this handsome gentleman that she slowly falls for, it would've lent a bit of mystery as to the surroundings of her waking up, and could've been used to place some suspicion on Jim and paint him in a less than heroic light. Or for the ending to have a bit more of an emotional force or sense of legacy (I won't expand on that, but you can guess what I mean once you see it).Passengers' other great strength is with the acting. You don't cast two of the most promising young stars today for no reason, and they're both worth their staggering paychecks. Chris Pratt is as effortlessly charming as ever as Jim. His first year on the ship, entirely alone, is heartbreaking, and the conflict inside him surrounding the moral dilemma is a pain to see on his face and in his body language. He certainly employs those puppy dog eyes that he does so well. Jennifer Lawrence once again proves why she's one of the most talented actresses working today. Besides the simply fantastic chemistry she shares with Pratt, a talent they both seem to share effortlessly, her own performances of love, desperation, anger, and shock are simply on another level. The moment she learns she was woken up by Jim, you can see her stomach sink at the crushing realisation of what's happened. Michael Sheen is simply great as Arthur, the android barman as well, providing words of wisdom and a deadpan expression throughout, while Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia never really get enough to sink their teeth into (particularly the latter, who appears for a matter of seconds and has no lines at all).The visuals are also quite impressive. The starship Avalon itself is an impressive imaginative design, spinning some iconic tropes and clichés of sci-fi ship design that crafting itself something new. It takes the spinning circles held together by gravity, but twists them into an appearance that more resembles strands of DNA. I can't say this is an entirely realistic movie in it's treatment of space (the sun they pass is far too dark, for example), but this is sci-fi after all, and not a retelling of The Martian. Where Passengers really excels in it's visual flair are the setpieces. Every room is a physical space with smooth, clean architecture. The variation in design and colouring from the bar to the Mexican restaurant, for instance, brings life to an otherwise dead and clinical environment.Passengers is a sci-fi that offers different questions than many other sci-fi films tend to gravitate towards. It still plays around with ethical and philosophical questions like most, but Passengers is far more controversial in it's treatment, and for me this is a strength rather than a weakness. Jim is a likable charming guy driven to something horrible by pure desperation and grief, and it shows his humanity. It shows that we all live in a grey ethical area and we can all succumb to horrible actions in extreme circumstances. Even fundamentally good people are capable of doing terrible things. I give Passengers a solid, critic-defying 8/10.",8,22,39,28 December 2016
Public Enemies," Heat, but better.
","I think there is no doubt in most peoples minds that Heat was a fantastic film. No means perfect, but pretty darn close. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Public Enemies is Heat, but better.Acting was good on all parts from everyone. Matching, if not surpassing that of Heat. The realism was accurate to the last detail. I don't know what it was like being alive in 1933, but I sure believed I was there. At times, I even thought this was a documentary. The camera work was fantastic and definitely unique. I've heard many bash the use of digital, but it really isn't that noticeable after a short while. The angles, shots and cinematography was awe-inspiring. Character development was right on the money, although I'd like to have had more on Melvin Purvis. The amount of character development was a major thing that puts it above Heat in my opinion. I often found Heat concentrated more than necessarily on developing the characters, even in the late stages. A good half hour could've been cut from Heat by reducing the development of each character, without it affecting to the final product much. The music and general sound also put it above your average film. It was sparse on music, but when there was music, it was used extremely well in all the right places and situations. The effects of guns and footsteps, and especially atmospheres in a room full of people was spot on. I'm guessing Mann opted to record the sound of what was going on as it was being filmed and including as much of it as possible, which is usually frowned upon it seems, but it really creates a mood and atmosphere, really makes you feel like you're there.However, although the relatively amateur techniques work, it does at times feel like an amateur movie. For this reason alone, I give it 9/10 rather than 10/10.",8,5,20,1 July 2009
Us," A Story of Classism and Nurture over Nature
","Us follows a family on vacation in the Santa Cruz area. The mother experienced a traumatic event in the same place back in the 80s and is reluctant to return, but the enthusiasm of her husband encourages her to soldier through for everyone else's sake. They come home to a family waiting in their driveway that look exactly like them, and then the violence begins. Turns out there's a doppelganger of every person in America living in extensive underground tunnels, mimicking every movement made above ground. That is until this fateful night when the entire population of Tethered emerge for a violent uprising.This is a movie that can be viewed at multiple levels, and how well it stands up depends on what level you view it at. On the surface it's literally just a movie of doppelgangers killing their originals and taking over. Dig a little deeper and you start to unearth plot holes and ask questions that were never intended to have answers (it's a movie, not everything has to be answered, otherwise we get The Da Vinci Code with a twenty-minute exposition dump in the middle). Dig even deeper than that and you start to reach the subtext and themes of the movie, the most fundamental of which being that of class. The Tethered are the lowest class. They literally live lower than everyone else, underground, and they have no wealth, no purpose, and they live off whatever they can find (in this case rabbits). Everyone else above them are middle-upper class. Of course for this point to hammer home, the only families we really see are middle-upper class by our standards already. Both the Wilsons and the Tylers have these large, modern vacation homes right on a closed lake, with their own boats. These are not people living on the bread line. Either way, they're completely ignorant to the Tethered's existence, living better lives in blissful ignorance, lives that the Tethered covet for themselves. Their above-ground violence is a revolution against the wealthy, as has been seen across the globe throughout history.But there's another layer to consider with the film's twist (SPOILERS, obviously). The Tethered are seen as the evil twins; violent, sociopathic, unable to communicate beyond grunts and yells. And yet the Adelaide we follow for the majority of the movie is herself a Tethered, with a family she made for herself. While her violent tendencies come out from time-to-time, she's an otherwise well-adjusted member of society. Jason and Zora are her biological children. Gabe is the man she fell in love with and married. There's no hoodwinking there. Despite not being the 'real' Adelaide, she lives a more real life than the real one does. On the flipside the real Adelaide (otherwise known as Red) is an original restricted to a life underground surrounded by Tethered. She's the only one down there with a degree of free will, and is seen as a leader figure for them, a focal point of some form of religion. She's almost god-like compared to her cohabitants. But she is ultimately moulded by her surroundings. She loses her voice, she grows resentful and violent, she's the only one aware of what's happening above ground and the only one that knows the life they lead isn't a natural one. She's the original Adelaide, and yet she is undoubtedly still the 'evil' one. But then that's the point isn't it; there's no such thing as an evil Adelaide. They're both good and bad in their own way, in their own worlds. We're all just products of our environments and others' perspectives.Luipta Nyong'o absolutely earns her top-billing in this film, managing both Adelaide and Red without missing a step. Adelaide is a traumatised and fearful woman who grew so accustomed to her nice life that she forgot who she really was. All she knows is she has an irrational fear of a place. With Red she gets room to play around with a more interesting character, one who has been driven to extremes by her circumstances. The raspy voice she gives Red is just icing on the cake that really emphasises the divide between the two Adelaides. Elisabeth Moss is also really good in her limited screentime, but much like Nyong'o, it's her Tethered character that gets the greater opportunity to impress and be creative. The way she reacts to real make-up, as well as the death of her Tethered husband is fascinating and creepy in equal measure. Winstone Duke is the opposite, really shining as the original Gabe and offering a large part of the film's comic relief. He's a guy easy to like and sympathise with, and it's just a flat-out joy watching him.The soundtrack by Michael Abels deserves a special mention too, and is largely responsible for why I might prefer this over Get Out. The creepy chanting really gives Us its own unique sonic quality, as well as perfectly fitting and emphasising the movie's unnerving quality from beginning to end. It marries so well with Peele's slow establishing shots that like to linger on a detail. Another stand-out is the remixed version of I Got 5 On It by Luniz, which is then adapted further by Abels into Pas De Deux for the film's climactic confrontation between Red and Adelaide. The licensed music is also great, especially damn The Police and Good Vibrations adding a fantastic comedy element to an otherwise dark and violent scene.Would Us have made it to my Top10 list? Yeah, more than likely, which is a little disappointing, but it is what it is. While I feel like Get Out might ultimately be Peele's better film, I can easily say I enjoyed Us more. Us is filled with plotholes, unanswered questions, and hapdash world-building, but ultimately I didn't find that any of that really mattered in the grand scheme of things. The film is really well-crafted, chock full of references, foreshadowing, and recurring motifs, with a fantastic score, brilliant performances, and a story that begs more questions of us and our role in society than it does about its own plot. I give Us a really good 8/10, and I can't wait for Peele's next movie.",8,5,12,26 February 2020
Knives Out," Johnson Delivers More Expectation Subversions
","Knives Out is a murder mystery movie through and through, echoing Sherlock, Poirot, and Murder She Wrote. But being a Rian Johnson movie, there's more beneath the surface than the obvious callbacks and parodies. If you go into this movie feeling like you know the outcome, you're wrong. This is a mystery cliché-free zone. The movie opens with the apparent suicide of a successful murder mystery author and the subsequent gathering of his family for the funeral, memorial, and will reading. Meanwhile a private detective has been hired by an anonymous client to look further into the suicide, with the full resources of the local police department behind him.The biggest and earliest cliché dodge of the movie is in revealing the details of Harlan Thrombey's death in the first half an hour. Yes, this is a murder mystery where the murder is solved (at least for the audience) really early. It's an inspiring choice that goes a long way to setting up the rest of the movie. We then follow the cover-up underneath Benoit Blanc's nose the entire time, giving us a fresh and new perspective in an otherwise overdone and tired genre. But don't let this lull you into thinking there's no mystery to be had. The explanation we get is still riddled with holes (doughnut holes, to be more precise), and there's the ever-pervading mystery of who hired Benoit Blanc in the first place, and why. I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking it too, but no, that's not the big twist at the end either.But Knives Out's success lies in not only the unpredictable twist, but the ingenious journey there. The climax of the movie is neither plainly obvious, but nor is it a complete left hook, coming out of nowhere based on no evidence, or on evidence only Benoit Blanc has seen, or on an overabundance of evidence and red herrings, nor is it so outlandish it borders on the unbelievable. The hints and clues are there throughout the movie if you're keen enough to catch them. I caught a couple myself, but had no way of applying them or even knowing they were clues until the final reveal at the end. By the time the credits have rolled, every loose end has been neatly tied up, and every set-up paid off in one way or another. There's an obvious set-up in the prop knife, but also keep a look out for the baseball and make sure you track its movements as the movie goes on, as well as the odd line and snippet of information offered by the characters, particularly around games.There's more to Knives Out than just the murder mystery though. For starters the cinematography is electric. It may not be so obvious as some of Johnson's previous work, but there's still some great cinematic shots to enjoy. Examples include Benoit's face bathed in shadow as he lights his cigar, or Meg's illuminated eyes while on the phone to Marta. Likewise the soundtrack perfectly embodies the murder mystery genre and makes you feel right at home as soon as the movie begins. It won't win any awards, but it suits the movie and does its job.Somewhat surprisingly there's also a level of comey throughout. Never quite laugh-out-loud hilarious, but there's plenty of jokes and running gags. Daniel Craig in particular seems to be having a lot of fun with this movie, putting on an over-the-top southern drawl, and coming out with lines such as 'The Nazi child masturbating in the bathroom' and 'The doughnut had a hole in the middle that was filled by another doughnut, your doughnut, but your doughnut also has a hole in the middle'. Surprisingly Michael Shannon has a selection of fantastic lines as well, such as 'I will not eat one iota of sh*t' and 'You want a cookie now?!' Chris Evans is another one quite obviously having a great time as a smarmy git, in stark contrast to his Captain America persona (sorry dude, you will always be compared to your most iconic role).On the note of acting, it was great to see Ana de Armas in the leading role (no, this is not Daniel Craig's movie), and not once did her insane attractiveness come up or be exemplified over her role in the story. She was her character and played her role like any other actor, proving that she absolutely has the acting chops capable of carrying an entire movie on her shoulders. Toni Collette is another stand-out as a privileged fashion/health guru, as is Christopher Plummer as the unfortunate Harlan Thrombey. And it was nice to actually see Frank Oz again, in his first live-action role in nearly twenty years.Knives Out was an all-round good fun movie. It'll keep you guessing up to the last, it'll keep you laughing and amused as it all unravels, and there's plenty more to mine in multiple viewings. I can't say it's the best of Rian Johnson's work, but it carries on his neverending streak of really good movies. I give Knives Out a solid 8/10.",8,1,3,29 November 2019
The Irishman," A Flawed Masterpiece
","The Irishman follows Frank Sheeran, a hitman for the Italian mob from the 50s to the 70s, and his friendships with union boss Jimmy Hoffa and mob boss Russ Bufalino, all culminating in Jimmy's assassination, and Frank's reflection in old age. It has all the hallmarks of a gangster movie that Scorsese does best, the hits, the deals, the respect, the broken families, but without all the glamour. The Irishman marks the end of gangster movies, putting a cap on a previously vibrate genre with a story altogether more sombre and depressing while equally as epic in scope.The movie does everything it can to strip the glamour away from being a gangster, depicting Frank as a soulless foot soldier without a thought for himself, and ultimately the last one left, to die alone of old age and the lack of dignity that entails. Everybody gets old and dies, even gangsters, and all of life's successes don't mean much when you can barely stand by yourself, you need help going to the loo, and your family have abandoned you to live their own lives. Respect means nothing when there's no-one left to respect or to be respected by.Talking of old age, I want to use this opportunity to segue into my biggest criticism of the entire movie. De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci are all fantastic actors, and they've all proven that time and time again over the years. They're true icons not just to the gangster genre, but to acting as a whole. Problem is they're all in their late seventies. Late in the movie this is fine as the characters start reaching that age, but early on, despite the untold millions spent on digitally de-aging all three of them, it's not enough. CGI doesn't mask how they move or posture themselves, and they move and posture themselves like a bunch of guys in their late seventies. All the de-aging does is smooth out their wrinkles and give them digital facelifts. At no point is this displacement more apparent than when Frank, in his late 30s, beats up a shop clerk for pushing his young daughter. De Niro no longer has the physicality required to move like a man in his late 30s, and so we get late-seventies chicken arms as he struggles to land the kicks and not fall over in the process.The actual de-aging itself isn't particularly great either. It is nice and subtle and you would barely even notice it was there if you had no idea about it going in, but because it's subtle, it just looks like old men in makeup. The most successful application is a shot of twenty-something Frank in Italy during WWII, but there's no lines to speak, and no facial close-ups to worry about. De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci never look much younger than their 50s even when they're meant to be young men in the primes of their lives. Where all that money and time went I have no idea, but all you have to do is turn on Scarface or Taxi Driver to see how badly they missed the mark.At three and a half hours long, The Irishman is the longest mainstream movie released in nearly thirty years, and it makes use of every minute and every second. The editing is tight and well-paced, making those three and a half hours relatively fly by. But the film is not immune to the problems of such a long runtime. Two of the most important scenes in the entire movie go on too long and come so late in the movie that they feel like a drag even if they aren't. Frank's celebration is a sombre scene of warnings and telling glances, exhibiting some fantastic acting moments between De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci, but by the end it starts to feel like gossiping girls with 'he said this' and 'he said that', and goes on so long that it feels meandering and labours the point.Similarly the final forty minutes or so happens after the climax of the movie. While these are arguably the most important moments in the entire movie, it likewise goes on and on and feels like labouring the point, which can feel anti-climatic after Hoffa's disappearance. You get the big climax the entire three hours of the film has been building up to and, wait, there's still another forty minutes to go as we slowly watch the remaining gangsters get sent to prison, age, and unceremoniously pass away. Don't misunderstand me, these scenes are important, full of great moments, and the movie would be less satisfying without them, but they drag on too long for a movie that's already a huge time investment.On the acting front, De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci all nail it. Pesci in particular offers potentially the performance of his long career, playing Russ in such a cold and calm demeanour that would be alien to previous Pesci characters, but arguably being way more threatening than even Tommy DeVito. Pacino has some great moments, particularly whenever he berates other people, but also some of the smaller, more intimate moments opposite De Niro. De Niro is also great of course, but I can't help but feel a little miscast as the 6'4 physically imposing Frank Sheeran. Stephen Graham is also a highlight as Tony Pro, and plays off Pacino and the rivalry between the two characters really well. Finally the last one of note is Anna Paquin as the grown-up version of Peggy, Sheeran's second daughter. She gets one line in the entire film, but up until that point her silent glances speak louder than anything else, and her one line becomes ever more poignant because of it.I feel like The Irishman has been a hard movie for me to judge. It's such a long movie that I'd forgotten many of the earlier moments by the time the film finished. Gangster epics like Godfather Part II and Once Upon a Time in America have always been difficult movies for me to get into, whether I liked them or not, and The Irishman is no different. It's a landmark film that won't be forgotten any time soon, and could easily be considered Scorsese's magnum opus, but I couldn't blind myself to the film's flaws, and found there was too much to distract me from what would otherwise be quite an intellectually challenging movie. I give it a solid 8/10, because ultimately its flaws aren't enough to detract how important this film is and will be to the gangster genre.",8,2,3,28 November 2019
Aquaman," Pretty to Look At, but Rushed, Badly-Written, and Weightless
","Aquaman's New52 run was a fantastic moment for the character, so it was definitely the best choice of story to adapt. Now here's the thing, the entire run covered four graphic novels - 25 issues - which is roughly two years of storytelling, including a crossover with Justice League (which added another five or six issues). That's huge. It's an epic story involving multiple smaller stories that all come together. For the movie, they came up with a story that was a combination of that entire 25-issue run. That's like trying to squeeze all three Lord of the Rings books into one movie.Okay, I get it, it was a loose adaptation for this very reason; cliffnote the important parts and tie together into a cohesive narrative, and I fully understand that things had to be moved about or cut out entirely in order to keep it manageable. Problem is, that's an antagonist per graphic novel, and we all know how the overabundance of villains affected Spider-Man 3. The Aquaman movie wants to squeeze in his origin and the fate of his mother, the Trench, Black Manta with his revenge for the death of his father, and Orm and his war on the surface world as antagonists (thank goodness they gave up on the idea of squeezing in the Dead King as well, and never even bothered with Vulko's betrayal), explore all seven kingdoms, and establish a romance between Arthur and Mera. It's too much to put into one movie, especially one as crazy and outlandish as this. It devolves the plot into a series of checkpoints that are all rushed through to get to the conclusion, meaning no moment is given time to breathe. None of the villains feel particularly well developed, Arthur and Mera's romance comes off as forced, the effects of everything on the outside world are completely forgotten about early on. Aquaman is just ferried from point A to point B to point C.Compounding this lack of space and atmosphere in the storytelling is the overdone formula of interruption. By which I mean if you took a shot everytime a serious moment was undercut by a cheesy one-liner, or a section of dialogue gets interrupted by an explosion, you'd be paralytic by the time the credits rolled. It was cool and unexpected the first time it happens, but by the third time it just got boring. I know! A movie featuring armoured sharks and a drumming octopus felt boring! How do you even manage that?!To continue the criticisms, what little immersion I had in this movie was completely broken by the nonsensical choice of licensed music. The use of Sigur Ros early on was a masterstroke I was completely behind, really suiting the scene it was put over. But then they lost their way and put in upbeat Depeche Mode over Black Manta building his suit after the death of his father, or getting Pitbull to sample/cover Africa by Toto (what?), and Skylar Grey's Everything I Need made the film feel like a Rom-Com once the credits rolled. For one, these songs were awful, but secondly they were just completely wrong for their scenes. The music's not all bad though. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score is actually pretty good. Not Hans Zimmer, Johann Johannsson or even Michael Giacchino levels of good, but by the halfway point it was his score that was keeping my sole interest going. Yeah, in a way it does sound like they saw Thor: Ragnarok and frantically tried to squeeze in as much 80s synth as they could, but I'll be honest, I think Gregson-Williams melded the 80s synth into the typical orchestral score much better than Mark Mothersbaugh did.And that's not my only praise either. The opening ten minutes or so sold me instantly that this could exceed my admittedly low expectations. The scenes between Nicole Kidman's Queen Atlanna and Temuera Morrison's Tom Curry were so charming and brimming with chemistry that you couldn't help but root for their romance. When Atlantis eventually came calling, we got a kick-ass fight scene with Atlanna acrobatically bouncing all over the house in a composite longshot, fending off the attackers and saving her family all at once. Unfortunately this was just about the highest point for me. Arthur beating on Manta senior and junior, and their crew, was pretty badass too, but after that all the action scenes lost their gravity. Literally. Underwater battles should be super cool, right? But I actually got kind of bored of them because there was no weight to any of the choreography. They just 'fly' all over the place. None of the punches felt like they landed, and the breaking of Atlanna's trident was only impactful because of its emotional implication for Arthur.Another mote of praise I have, this time without any kind of criticism attached, was the visuals. Rushed story, awful music choices, and weightless action scenes aside, Aquaman is a devastatingly pretty movie to look at. The use of bright neon colours really gave it its own visual identity. Each of the seven kingdoms are designed so uniquely from one another that you can tell where you are at a glance. Arthur and Mera diving deep while being swarmed by the Trench is wall-mountingly gorgeous imagery. Of course there's the inherent concept of Aquaman's world as well, with armoured sharks, a drumming octopus, and soldiers riding giant seahorses. Atlantis looks truly mythological. And the CGI underwater hair is flawless, far better than other attempts in the likes of Inhumans or even the otherwise fantastic Arrival.I can't say I was disappointed in Aquaman, as I already had pretty rock-bottom expectations. It starts out incredibly strong, but it quickly goes downhill as they try to squeeze way too much into the story, forcing it to rush from plot point to plot point. It's formulaic and badly written, with some truly cringeworthy dialogue, a forced romance, and lofty action sequences that were frankly boring to watch. It's a really pretty-looking movie though, with some fantastic CGI and set designs, and every character is brought to life visually. I give Aquaman a bad 4/10. It's not the worst you'll see, but goddamn I wish I had gone to see Into the Spider-Verse instead.",4,13,25,18 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Completely Different and Just As Good
","The first film was a complete surprise hit, that somehow managed to be way better than even die-hard fanboys could have anticipated. Initially that gave me a great amount of excitement for the sequel, but in recent months the doubt of sequel syndrome has been creeping in. There's no way it could be better, not with a bigger budget, more convoluted story, and more characters. No way.I'm glad that, to a degree, I was wrong. It's certainly not better than the original, even if just because the first film was so fresh and unexpected and changed the entire superhero game for Fox. But Deadpool 2 does at least match it's predecessor by upping the ante in the best ways and never taking it too far. The story is a little more complicated than the first film (which ultimately boiled down to three scenes), involving time travel, assembling a team, and the lack of a real villain. While both movie's stories are not exactly the paragon of originality, both the first film and its sequel wear their influences on their sleeves.Of course this is one of Deadpool's trademarks, and Deadpool 2 is no different. It's extremely self-aware, not only of itself but also of its context in the genre and pop culture in general. In many ways, Deadpool 2 feels almost like Ready Player One - chock full of references, easter eggs, and inside jokes. The film opens with a music box of Wolverine impaled on a branch in reference to the end of Logan, the opening credits play out like a James Bond movie, complete with a melancholic ballad by Celine Dion, Deadpool refers to Josh Brolin's character as Thanos, and asks how many Sharknado movies there are in the future, a prisoner number is the same as Hugh Jackman's in Les Miserables, there's a running joke about Kirsten Dunst in Interview with the Vampire, and on and on and on. Not to mention sly cameos from Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and the majority of the X-Men: First Class cast. Oh god it's a treasure trove, and each and every one is played for comedic effect (unlike Ready Player One that used it all as world building).Time (and multiple rewatches) will tell on this, but Deadpool 2 is also potentially funnier than the first. Its jokes feels so much more natural, and they come thick and fast. Many of them are referential so they do depend on a certain degree of audience knowledge, but otherwise it's still packed full of more straightforward jokes like Wade having legs the size of a toddlers, Deadpool failing to die repeatedly throughout the whole film, unexpected side-effects of a superhero landing, and so on and so forth. Of course the humour is certainly not for those weak of disposition, with plenty of more adult-orientated jokes dotted about the place as well.As with the first film, the gore is also not advised for those of a weaker disposition. In fact there might even be a bit more gore this time. Deadpool's ability to resist fatal injury is played up as far as it can go, including blowing him up into little pieces, having him torn in half, and breaking his back falling from a great height, but there's also plenty of graphic stabbings, shootings, squashings and beheadings that don't hide the details.One thing that Deadpool 2 definitely does better than the first film is action. The action sequences in Deadpool 2 are super stylish and super entertaining to watch. I guess this is the benefit of having David Leitch behind the cameras. The fight choreography is on point, managing to be gory and realistic, while also making the most of the superhero benefits. Cable is a complete and utter badass for instance, punching his weight about with such a strength and ferocity in stark contrast to Deadpool's more reckless style. MVP of the action scenes though is definitely Domino who just waltzes her way through as everything collapses around her. Her superpower of luck is portrayed unimaginably well by putting her in the middle of chaos that simply can't touch her, but falls afoul of everyone around her.But what made the first Deadpool so strong wasn't the humour, the action, or its self-awareness (although they all played a big part in it of course). What really surprised everyone was how truly charming and emotional it was as a Romance. The relationship built up between Wade and Vanessa is so endearing, and his terminal diagnosis really stings the tear ducts hard. While Deadpool 2 never quite reaches the same zenith of emotional depth, it certainly makes a good attempt at it. Wade's depiction of grief is top notch for starters, but the whole plot of saving the future by saving a kid from himself can also hit pretty hard.Deadpool 2 is a completely different animal to the first film. It's no longer held back by being the risk it was, and now that the origin story is out the way, it makes the most of giving us a bigger plot that's a little more standard for a superhero movie, but nonetheless still great. It's a laugh a minute packed full of easter eggs, cameos, and fourth wall breaks, but doesn't forget its more heartfelt core that keeps it's characters relatable and sympathetic. Honestly, I could talk about this movie way more, but by that point you may as well just go and see it for yourself. I give Deadpool 2 a cautious 9/10.",9,3,6,22 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Welcome to the Marvel Cosmic Universe!
","Okay so the first thing to note about Ragnarok, which if you have enough brain cells you'd guess yourself after seeing the trailer, is that it's nothing like the previous two Thor movies, beyond sharing some characters and settings. The tone is completely different. In fact it's probably better to compare Ragnarok to Guardians of the Galaxy with it's straight comedy angle and influx of neon colours and whacky concepts. This is the new world order for Marvel's Cosmic Universe in full swing. How this makes me feel isn't quite so clear. As I said, I really didn't mind the other Thor movies, and to see the brooding seriousness get thrown out entirely, particularly in a movie about the end of days, seems like a misplaced choice. That said this is what Waititi does best, and he's on top, What We Do in the Shadows form here.Ragnarok is jam-packed full of jokes and gags, and every single one of them lands with aplomb. From Thor asking Surtur to pause while he helplessly spins around at the beginning, to the Grandmaster declaring a tie in Sakaar's revolution, each and every slither of humour is guaranteed to earn a laugh. It's typical Waititi humour; awkward, modern, and using juxtaposition to great effect. Korg, a large being made of rocks, talking about his revolution failing because he didn't hand out enough pamphlets hits so hard because it's so against what you'd expect from that kind of alien.Waititi's also in his element with running jokes, coming into a franchise nearly twenty movies in full of continuity to adhere to, poke fun at, and address in one way or another. Loki taking Odin's place in Asgard is dealt with swiftly, with a couple of gags thrown in, including surprise cameos. Hulk disappearing at the end of Age of Ultron is addressed with heartbreak and a couple of touching moments between Thor and Hulk/Banner. And Hela knocking over the Infinity Gauntlet in Asgard's vault because it's 'fake' was a great way to plug such a tiny yet significant plot hole.Despite how humorous Ragnarok is, it doesn't shy away from more serious themes and ideas though. Thor's companions in the Warriors Three are dispatched of quickly and without remorse, Hela raising an army of the dead from the Asgard crypts is a pretty dark idea, and of course there's the whole Ragnarok thing. Not only is this movie one of the funniest entries in the MCU, but it also has some of the biggest stakes so far. By the end of the film, Thor's life is permanently changed in a massive way. But Ragnarok is still not perfect. It still doesn't quite reach the heights of either of the Guardians movies or Winter Soldier. It's opening act feels a little messy, rushing through plot points to get to the meat of it. Thor's tied up in chains at the behest of Surtur, now he's in Asgard unveiling Loki, now he's with Doctor Strange looking for Odin, now he's in Norway bracing for Hela's arrival, now he's on Sakaar about to face the Grandmaster's champion. It's almost all rushed, and some of it feels pointless. Like, Doctor Strange's role is completely unnecessary. He's just put in for an Earthling presence in a movie that frankly didn't need it.Hela is also another in a long line of lacklustre MCU villains. She's the first female villain to pose as the main antagonist, which is great, and Cate Blanchett is perfect for her (I think I'm in love). She has an interesting backstory, but it's never really developed. Hela ends up just becoming another two-dimensional mustache- twirling villain with a plan that's flawed from the offset and no motivation beyond just being evil. Her being the Goddess of Death is never really capitalised on either, outside of her resurrecting dead soldiers of Asgard's crypts reasonably early on.That said, almost every other character is great. Thor's sense of humour is brought to the forefront with some surprisingly great comedic chops from Hemsworth, without it taking away from his more serious moments. He's still Thor despite the tonal shift around him. Likewise, Loki is the same old Loki, with his tricks and betrayals, and his history with Hulk is played up to perfection. Valkyrie and Skurge both enjoy character arcs that help to develop them, and both Tessa Thompson and Karl Urban make their mark on the movie. Waititi even gets to add some of himself into the movie as Korg, who promises to steal every scene he's in. And of course Mark Ruffalo manages to play Hulk completely by himself for the first time and gives us the best Hulk we've ever had.Ragnarok is another part of Marvel's current hot streak, and here's hoping it continues just a little bit longer at least. It's a massive tonal shift from the rest of the Thor franchise, feeling closer to the Guardians franchise, which is a win/lose depending on your point of view. The music is a step in the right direction, utilising Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song really well, as well as adding some 80's synth/video game music underneath Marvel's standard, dull strings arrangements, but it's largely still unmemorable and unremarkable. The visuals are fantastic, employing a style closer to Snyder's approach in the DCEU than Marvel's usual grey realism, which I personally consider a massive plus. But of course it's the humour that keeps Ragnarok afloat, and the massive stakes leave me begging to find out what happens next. I give Ragnarok a high 8/10. Easily the best Thor movie so far.P.S. Where was Sif?!",8,44,77,31 October 2017
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Could've been so much more...
","I watched the first Hellboy and thought it was pretty good, so when I saw the adverts for this and noticed the outstanding visuals, I thought it definitely had to be watched. Where better to watch such visual fantasies than the cinema.It started off far from satisfactory with the worst acting I've ever seen from a child actor, I'm sure they could've someone better, luckily, John Hurt was there to save it. From that point it started to improve. I loved Del Toro's vision of tooth fairies and the scenes in the auction house were chilling. The action was crisp and imaginative. I was impressed and couldn't wait to see more. The adaptation of the elves was fantastic. They looked so other-worldly, yet human and realistic. The scene in the throne room is one of my favourites in cinema history. Del Toro paid a lot of attention to the visual details. The main story was also very interesting, I'd have loved to have seen more of it, like in a spin-off epic on similar proportions as Lord of the Rings. The marketplace was astounding, I truly believed there was really a place like that, so full of life of weird creatures of fantasy that we know nothing about. The representation of the Angel of Death was absolutely fantastic, possibly my second favourite moment in cinema history.However, I found too many characters on Hellboys side too annoying. They're supposed to be the good guys, I'm supposed to like them. I just found them pathetic and invigorating. Abe's hastiness to fall in love so quickly and surely just reminded me of those thirteen year old kids who think they know everything about love, and they really irritate me. Krauss's accent was ridiculous and his need to obey all the rules was ridiculous, the notion that he'd then go back on himself and disobey rules was just unbelievable. However, him vs Hellboy was definitely a highlight of the film and the character got kudos. The inclusion of Liz's pregnancy was fearfully predictable and cheesy. In fact, I think the only heroic character I did like was Hellboy. In addition, the end felt like it was a bit rushed.So to wrap up my review; This could've been so much more. Cut out the cheesiness and ridiculousness and this could've been a fantastic fantasy epic. Cut out the fantastic visuals and epic storyline and this would've been good as a cheesy, generally entertaining film that doesn't have to make sense. Del Toro was trying to merge two completely different styles of movie entertainment and it just didn't blend. I would much rather it wasn't a Hellboy film, but a completely new, imaginative and visually stunning fantasy epic, but that's just me.",6,5,8,28 March 2009
Ready Player One," No Movie has Ever made me feel Nerdier
","If there's one thing that rivals the MCU in the Hollywood landscape of blockbusters today, it's movies that play on the audience's nostalgia. Reboots, remakes, and sequels to movies and franchises decades old have been dominating, from the revival of the Star Wars and Jurassic Park franchises to cult classics like Blade Runner getting long-awaited sequels. And each one goes out of it's way to include references to the original, include original characters aged and older, and plays on the audiences nostalgia through intertextuality (thank you Nerdwriter for that term). But none of them compare on the nostalgia scale to Ready Player One, a film almost entirely composed of pop culture easter eggs.It's the future and humanity has pretty much given up on fixing the world. Poverty and corruption are rife, and people have stopped caring, instead opting to spend all their free time in the virtual world of the Oasis; an MMORPG so developed that its virtual currency and the real world currency are interchangeable, and that people go there to learn and to work, as well as escape the brutal reality of the American slums. The creator of the Oasis passed away, and left the keys to his inheritance to any player who can solve a series of impossible tasks. So impossible in fact that no-one's managed to solve the first challenge in five years. Enter Wade Watts, or Parzival as he goes by in the Oasis, who kickstarts an avalanche of quests, clues, celebrity, and corporate intrigue when careful puzzlework helps him figure out how to beat the first challenge.The plot is fairly simple, and in fact feels like an easter egg in itself, resembling the action adventure movies of the 80s like The Goonies, Labyrinth, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. We have our protagonist, a misfit group of friends, a love interest, an over-the-top antagonist, a quest, and a series of puzzles and mysteries to figure out along the way. In the narrative department, Ready Player One is not breaking any new ground, but it's deliberately not trying to be. In my opinion this is the most subtle and foundational easter egg of the whole movie; that it feels - at its core - like a movie from the 80s/90s, and follows all the same beats you would expect from those kinds of movies.As a result, Ready Player One's first and foremost priority is in pure entertainment. It's a movie of spectacle that strings the audience along for two and a half hours, and rarely flirts with anything deeper. Of course there is subtext, but it's never focussed on. The whole idea of an MMORPG taking over the lives of millions across the globe as they seek to escape the harsh truths of reality are as relevant today as they've ever been. It also flirts with the identity crisis such a dual-life would result in as well, and the blurring of lines between virtual and reality, but again it's only ever subtext and a big thing is never made of any of it. I could see the source material as being ripe for a full-on satirical interpretation, but Spielberg's movie is not it.Instead, Ready Player One's depth comes from it's celebration of nerd culture (and boy did I feel nerdy watching this movie). Every frame is painstakingly filled with references to something somewhere that you would consider nerdy. Sometimes it's obvious like King Kong interrupting a race, or Iron Giant and a Gundam fighting Mechagodzilla, sometimes it's lain out in the dialogue like the offer of a Millenium Falcon, figuring out which Atari game fits the puzzle, or chanting a spell from Excalibur, sometimes it's an avatar or NPC like Harley Quinn and Joker in the virtual club, Duke Nukem being beaten in PvP, or Tracer from Overwatch in the final battle, sometimes it's an item like a weapon or a vehicle like Akira's bike (not a Light Cycle, I promise), the Battlestar Galactica, Monty Python's Holy Hand Grenade, or a coffin shaped like a Photon Torpedo in Star Trek, sometimes it's a setting like Planet Doom, Minecraft World, or the Overlook Hotel, sometimes it's something in the background like Dungeons and Dragons graffiti, a Donkey Kong Jr poster, or someone wearing a Joy Division T-shirt, or sometimes it's even an action like the T-800s thumbs up, a hadouken from Street Fighter, or a dance-off to Bee Gees Stayin' Alive. And what I've mentioned is just scratching the surface. To list everything out would take up the entire review and then some, and then I'd probably have still missed out a whole bunch. And even with my own proliferation with pop culture, I still missed over half of the references when I was there, either due a lack of knowledge or familiarity, or simply because I went in deciding to just enjoy whatever I saw, and not to spend the entire time dissecting every scene. Because you could easily go into this movie and spend the entire time picking out every morsel of reference, homage, and easter egg, and end up missing the grander tapestry, at which point you have to wonder why you bothered watching it in the first place.Ultimately Ready Player One could've fallen at the first hurdle. It could've skirted the easter egg rich universe entirely, or conversely made each reference feel forced and shoehorned in. Instead Spielberg toes the careful balance and makes sure that every little thing either has meaning or importance to the plot, or is so far in the background, surrounded by like-minded homages, that it doesn't even matter. Above all, everything feels natural and like it fits. There's nothing to do with sports or politics or history, it's entirely composed of pop culture spanning from the 40s and 50s all the way up to the modern day, and doesn't appear to favour any type or era of reference over another. Movies, Games, TV shows, even Music and Food are covered so long as they fit the geek requirement.Of course being set in a virtual reality, about two thirds of the movie is entirely computer generated. But this is not a criticism. The visual effects are fantastic. I went in expecting some rough edges borne of entirely CGI characters, but there wasn't really much of an uncanny valley to cross as each character is so wonderfully unreal. Even for a video game, the effects are so good. It kicks it up at various points, blending CGI and live-action together really well, like with Halliday's library of memories. And of course every reference and homage is recreated to perfection as well. The Gundam appearing in the sky looked like a live-action version of the anime, and the Overlook Hotel is exactly as it was in The Shining (although a little crisper, of course). If nothing else, this attention to detail makes Ready Player One incredibly immersive. It didn't take me long to get dragged into the world so completely that I forgot I was sat in a cinema.The only criticism I feel I can muster that feels fair is a bit of rushed pacing between the second and third acts. We spend so long establishing the world and getting to know our characters, and suddenly we need to have the big finale and wrap everything up, so it opts to skip out a massive key detail entirely and cover it in dialogue. Also the whole quest to find all three keys should take weeks if not months, but instead it feels like it takes place over a few days at most, and the transition between the second and third acts is so quick it literally feels like a snap of the fingers. The sense of timing is completely lost.Ready Player One is just pure entertainment and spectacle. There's nothing deep going on here, there's nothing particularly groundbreaking in the more technical aspects, the characters are interesting enough to get you emotionally involved but little more. Spielberg used to be the king of Blockbusters, and while he's focussed more on period and dramatic pieces recently, Ready Player One shows that he hasn't lost his touch. I lost myself in this movie as it strung me along from one plot point to the next. If nothing else, it showed me not only how deep my nerdiness goes, but also shows how comparatively shallow it is compared to others. I give Ready Player One a high 8/10.",8,1,3,4 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino was always best at Dialogue
","Hateful Eight is like a cross between Django Unchained and Tarantino's breakout Reservoir Dogs. It takes that Western setting and heavy undercurrents of racial tension, and sticks it, with all it's characters, in one confined space and drives it with dialogue and character. It's slow going to begin with, so I can't stress this focus on dialogue enough. The first gunshot isn't until the halfway point of the movie. Before that we follow the stagecoach as it races a blizzard and picks up lone strangers. Even once we reach the cabin that it all takes place in, the dialogue maintains it's centre stage to build up the characters and display the in-built tensions between them.But when it comes to Tarantino, this focus on dialogue and character is absolutely not a criticism. Ever since Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's strength as a filmmaker has been with writing dialogue and directing actors to get the best delivery of it. Hateful Eight is, once again, no exception. While there's no action per se, the conversations between characters are interesting enough, and heaped with enough suspense straight out the box, that you don't need gun fights and blood every ten minutes. What a lot of it boils down to is the aftermath of the civil war, as characters from each side find themselves sharing a room with the opposition, and all are not happy about it.There's an eclectic array of characters on display here, which is another of Tarantino's strengths, but this is also where the film begins to falter. The leading man is arguably Samuel L. Jackson's Major Warren, who plays the black guy trying to make it in a white man's world. Such are his methods of survival in this outnumbered situation that he's not entirely the most trustworthy character, which can make him hard to root for at times. Fortunately, everyone else is just as despicable, or worse. Kurt Russell is John Ruth, a bounty hunter who parades the title 'The Hangman' as he always make sure his bounties are returned alive ready for hanging. He doesn't have all too much respect for women, although he has the most respect for Major Warren than anyone else in the movie, and he's paranoid to the smallest detail. Jennifer Jason Leigh hams it up completely as Ruth's bounty; Daisy Domergue. She's rude and uncaring, and Leigh obviously had a lot of fun playing the part.Tim Roth brings in a fantastic performance as Oswaldo Mobray, the English Hangman of the town, but beyond his fairly neutral stance in the confrontations, there isn't really much character there. The same of which can be said of Michael Madsen's Joe Gage who is completely void of any character or presence. We're given no insight into him at all and Madsen just lazes and mumbles through the role, as if he doesn't really want to be there. Bruce Dern, however, brings spirits back up (or down) as General Smithers who fought against Major Warren in the civil war. This conflict is the root of the biggest racial tension in the group, but there's definitely more at play bubbling beneath the surface. Once the action does kick in in the third act, Hateful Eight becomes possibly Tarantino's bloodiest movie yet, which is saying a lot. I haven't seen Django in a while, with it's pools of blood at the end, but Hateful Eight just felt bloodier. I'm not even sure that's a claim I can attribute to visuals, as it even sounds bloody as various characters squelch in their own plasma. A couple of characters violently vomit blood, a couple get their heads completely obliterated, almost everyone gets drenched in it, be it their own or someone else's. By the time the credits role, there's just blood everywhere.Finally, the 70mm. I didn't watch it in a special 70mm cinema (at least, I don't think I did), but the picture was noticeably wider than usual. 70mm is usually used for vast and beautiful landscapes and settings, which makes it feel like an odd choice for a movie that spends 75% of it's time in one confined space. And yet, the extra widescreen is used to it's maximum capability. On more than a couple of occasions, characters are seen facing off against one another from opposite ends of the room, and with the 70mm adding that extra bit of width, you can see them both at either end. Make the screen any narrower and you would have absolutely cut one of them out. The extra width here is used less for the landscapes (although there are plenty in the opening moments), but more for capturing the whole breadth of the Habdashery and all it's dwellers.To close, Hateful Eight is far from Tarantino's best movie, no denying that. It's slow going for a lot of the movie, a lot of the dialogue could have been trimmed further, and a number of characters could have done with a little more work. It's also Tarantino's most straight forward in terms of plot (although there are a couple of twists here and there, and even until it's final moments, you're not entirely sure who'll make it out alive), and it's themes are often retreads of what he's done before (in fact, Hateful Eight often feels like a pseudo-sequel to Django Unchained). However it maintains it's entertainment value, and it's shortcomings are more than balanced by his trademark brilliance elsewhere. It looks great and it sounds great, and I guarantee you'll be on the edge of your seat by the third act. I give Hateful Eight a somewhat fitting 8/10.",8,3,10,13 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," A Movie about the nature of Truth and Perspective
","I'll admit, before this movie I had no idea who Tonya Harding was (I was about 4 at the time). A biopic about a figure skater? Why would I care about that? It's probably some prissy inspirational sports movie. But then the trailer dropped and painted it more as a figure skating movie dressed as a Scorsese gangster pic. Suddenly my interest piqued.For those unaware, I, Tonya follows the story of infamous American figure skater Tonya Harding. She came from a working class background and suffered an abusive mother (and later an abusive husband), but she found her calling at a young age and carried on, ultimately becoming the first American woman to successfully land a triple axel (a move far too complicated for me to fully understand) in high level competition. Unfortunately that was her peak, and she ended up in fourth at the '92 Winter Olympics. When the '94 Winter Olympics came along, she picked herself back up to get back in the game. Unfortunately for her, her ex-husband - desperate to help her out - decided to intimidate Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya's biggest competition both for qualifying and for medals, but it got out of hand and Tonya was implicated in a serious case of GBH, banned from skating for life, and has suffered an infamy ever since (eclipsed that year only by OJ Simpson himself).Tonya's innocence, and the degree of her involvement in the plot against Nancy, has been a point of debate for the last two decades. At the time she was painted unequivocally as the villain, but as time has gone on, the truth has become mired in contradictory accounts from all involved, and I, Tonya uses this to it's advantage. It breaks the main narrative up with mock interviews with the characters (which were apparently based on real interviews), and fourth-wall breaking, complete with a disclaimer at the beginning that the story is told from contradictory information. While on the surface this is a Tonya Harding biopic, it takes the opportunity to tell a deeper story of truth and perspective. One person's truth is not the same as another's, which is a point beautifully made with the mock interviews by having them deliver the same lines at the same time in a different way with different meanings behind it.As such, it paints a picture of characters enveloped in shades of grey. No-one is a flat-out antagonist (apart from maybe Tonya's mother), and no-one is a heroic protagonist. Even Tonya herself is painted in a light that is both sympathetic and accusatory (although I'll admit more on the sympathetic side; this is her biopic after all). The character work is absolutely solid, even down to the supporting characters. And on the note of culpability, the film never really takes a side on that either, instead offering a composite of both innocence and guilt.Of course the shades of grey characters would not have come off all that well without some serious talent and hard work behind them. Fortunately I, Tonya is a powerhouse of performances. Margot Robbie is absolutely the star of her own film (she was an active producer as well). Her Tonya is both trashy and likeable in equal measure. She manages to embody her spine and her vulnerabilities really well and tap into both at a moments notice often in the same scenes. There's one scene in particular where she's just putting make-up on, and goes through so many emotions in less than a minute; from breaking down to gritted determination to fake happiness to sheer desperation. Allison Janney is the other big performer offering as close to an antagonist as the movie gets. LaVona is brutally cold and emotionless, and yet her one moment of reaching out oddly doesn't feel out of character at all. Sebastian Stan is also really good as Tonya's abusive husband, with a fury to fear and a pathetic desperation for love both. And then there's Paul Walter Hauser as Jeff's friend who does such a fantastic job of such a fundamentally stupid character, without going too far and making him a hammy one-trick performance. The added real-life footage at the end really brings his performance as Sean into a great light.From a more technical standpoint, I, Tonya finds it's biggest pitfall though. There's a fair amount of CGI used here (for a drama) to put Margot Robbie's face on a figure skater, and it can be painfully obvious at times. That said the famous triple axel move was entirely CGI'd (as such a difficult move as it is, there aren't many around who can actually perform it, and those who can can't afford to waste an injury on a movie) and you wouldn't know, even when it's put through slow-motion. The music is also a little hit-and-miss. On one hand it uses some great tracks from Fleetwood Mac, Supertramp, and Siouxsie and the Banshees, but on the other hand they're all tracks that get used in movies a lot and by this point are starting to feel a little clichÃ©.I enjoyed I, Tonya a fair amount. While it does absolutely paint Tonya more sympathetically than mid-90s media, it somehow feels closer to the truth of 'the incident' than we'll likely ever get, and utilising the opportunity to make the movie a composite of contradictions result in some hugely entertaining and humourous interactions. The true-life footage and catch-ups at the end are really eye-opening as well, showing that the story that's at times too stupid to believe wasn't exaggerated in the areas you'd expect. I give I, Tonya a low 8/10.",8,1,1,27 February 2018
Moana," Disney's Usual Top-Quality
","Moana is, in many ways, exactly what you'd expect from a 'Disney Princess' movie. It's story follows the fundamental formula that has done Disney so well for decades, mixing in Polynesian mythology to spice it up a bit. We have our titular heroine, born into a place of responsibilities, embarking on a journey of self-discovery to save her people, with the help of comic companions and fantastical entities. I mean, it's Disney, this is what they do, time and time again, so I won't judge too harshly. Although there is no love interest - no prince - and that was certainly a welcome diversion from the formula.Of course what sets Moana apart is it's setting and mythology. The world is dying because Te Fiti, the goddess of life, has lost her heart, stolen by 'hero of men' Maui. Moana is chosen by the ocean to find Maui and together bring the heart back to Te Fiti, and stop the death and decay encroaching on her island. While it's fundamentally full of tropes and clichés, a lot of mythology across the world is full of the same stories supplanted with different characters. Is Moana an accurate representation of this culture? Maybe, I'm not exactly an expert, but the directors did go out of their way to research this world of islands and ocean, so I'm inclined to believe it's reasonably respectful.The animation manages to bring this paradisaical world to life with vibrant colours and beautiful landscapes. This is Disney, so of course the animation is super top-quality. There really isn't much to fault. I didn't notice it particularly breaking any new ground, but the sheer attention to detail paid to the ocean waves, the grains of sand, Maui's skin, and Te Fiti in general were certainly impressive sights to behold. Most noticeably it's not all CGI. All the tattoos are hand- drawn, which makes Maui's little tattoo companion all the more impressive. There's also a scene late into Maui's introductory song where the backdrop is 2D animation, which helped it stand out as a scene, but I'm not entirely it worked from a visual stand point, as Maui and Moana remain in 3D and stick out really obviously.The songs were a bit of a disappointment. Disney is usually great with their musical choices, but Moana's songs just lacked something. It didn't help that the characters constantly pointed out that they were singing, or saying they wanted to avoid another song. It took me out of the immersion even further than the actual Musical elements themselves. For me, I was looking forward to some songs in a Polynesian style, or at least Hawaiian, with ukuleles and other indigenous instruments and vocal methods. Instead each song sounded like normal run-of-the- mill American pop songs, generic and safe, and only marginally catchy.Tamatoa's song was super reminiscent of David Bowie in a homage to the late musician, which in itself is great, but it felt misplaced in this movie, and in the pool of Disney Villain songs, is probably one of the weakest of the lot. Maui's song was probably my favourite, and hearing Dwayne Johnson actually sing was definitely a welcome surprise. That said, and this is a niggle from a musically trained ear, the amount of auto-tune he required was painfully obvious, particularly during the chorus. Moana's song was quite enjoyable, and it's reprise late in the movie was really cool, highlighting the development she has endured as a character on this journey, but it wasn't particularly catchy. It's certainly not even in the same league as Let it Go, or Be My Guest, or Defeat the Huns, or any of the timeless classic musical numbers Disney have had.The voice acting was really good, again unsurprising coming from Disney. I will say though, the choice of casting is a landmark for a blockbuster family movie, or any big budget movie for that matter. Almost every member of the cast has pacific heritage, be it Hawaiian or Maori, and while that ultimately doesn't account for much when all you get of them is their voices, it was nonetheless a fantastic choice behind-the-scenes that I cannot commend Disney for enough. Dwayne Johnson proves once again that he is so underrated as an actor. He's more than just an ex-wrestler. His voice performance as Maui is definitely one of the high points of the entire movie, perfectly embodying the peak and troughs of Maui's egotistical, but fundamentally golden hearted personality. Auli'i Cravalho is also pretty great as Moana herself, showing a surprising amount of talent in this field for someone her age, but her voice wasn't anything particularly special, making the big fuss about the search for her feel a little pointless and over-inflated. She sounds just like every other Disney heroine. The supporting cast is all great as well, including Temuera Morrison as Moana's father, Nichole Scherzinger as her mother (although I'm not sure she had more than a couple of lines?), Rachel House as her grandmother, Alan Tudyk's clucking and squawking as her chicken companion, and Jermaine Clement's shiny giant crab of the underworld (marking the second time in the last few days I have mistaken his voice for Jason Flemyngs).Moana is definitely a Disney movie, with high quality animation, song-work, and voice acting. It's story follows the usual formula with just a handful of twists and new approaches, supplanted to a unique and fairly unknown mythology. In the grand scheme of things, Moana isn't anything special. It will sink into the gloop of really well made Disney that fails to really stand out. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.",7,1,11,7 December 2016
BlacKkKlansman," This is Not Just a Movie
","If I'm being honest, I always struggle reviewing movies that tackle racism in America. For starters I'm not American, so it doesn't quite hit as close to home as it maybe intends. More than that I'm white, and I live in a majorly white area. I've never experienced that kind of treatment, so I admit it makes it hard to empathise sometimes. But no movie has created as much turmoil of approach for me as this one. I'm not Spike Lee's biggest fan, on a personal level. I feel he makes too much about his race, and his protests often just come across as childish rather than passionate, but I don't want to get too deep into that. His movies often tackle difficult subject matter, especially those that cover the plights of the black community. My issue is that I'm not entirely confident I received the message he was trying to tell.Okay, so the movie is about Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs' first black police officer in the 70s. He infiltrates the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan with the help of his Jewish colleague. A mixture of hilarity and tension ensues from the situations the characters find themselves in. But Lee also adds in a completely fictional character to add a black point of view, I guess, in Patrice. Honestly I have no idea what his intent is with her character. I can imagine to many of the black community she is represented as a hero, but to me I found her to be almost as bad as the Ku Klux Klan. I'm torn because I don't see Spike Lee (or what I know of him) to intentionally put in a black character for us to root against. I don't see the point he's making with her. Is he trying to appeal to those who paint the police as the villains? Is he trying to pin the blame on the police force himself? Or is he genuinely attempting a more partisan position by showing that black people can have outrageous and generalised views of the 'opposition' as well? Because that last one is how it came off to me, and yet doesn't fit the general theme of the movie at all. Maybe this confusion was exactly his intent.The rest of the movie is solid through and through. It's smartly written, and full of subtle callbacks you wouldn't pick up on without dissecting the film. The most poignant, especially as a film reviewer, was the subject of films and their impact on the race issue. At one point Ron is debating with Patrice about blaxploitation movies of the 70s. He finds the humour and entertainment in them, while she sees them as offensive, and he remarks that they're only movies. True enough, they are, made purely for entertainment value and to appeal to the black audiences of the time. But later on in the movie Ron witnesses a KKK meeting where they enjoy The Birth of a Nation with a racist uproar. The KKK in the movie are portrayed as all American heroes and the KKK watching it celebrate this like a party. At that point it's not just a movie. It's propaganda. It's the celebration and normalisation of racism. This is a very important point to make, not just about BlacKkKlansman, but about movies in general. Sometimes movies are not just movies. Sometimes there are agendas behind them. Sometimes they're used to fuel movements and steer public opinion. Lee wants you to know this while watching this movie so that you can't just shrug it off as 'just a movie'. He wants you to pay attention to what he's saying, because it's important.Another thing I wasn't sure of on the initial watch of this movie was the very end, but I'm definitely coming around to it being somewhat a stroke of genius. The movie has finished, the characters have had everything resolved (for the most part), and this is where the credits would roll. Except they don't. Instead we cut to real life footage from 2017 in Charlottesville. We see the real David Duke on a podium speaking in support of Trump and making America great again, not even attempting to hide his racism. In the middle of this we cut to rallies and marches, both from white supremacists, and the black lives matter movement. It all culminates in footage of a car charging through a crowd of black lives matter supporters, and a dedication to the woman who died as a result of it. My initial impression was slightly irksome. It took me out of the movie entirely, and I didn't immediately see why it was included. It felt like a curveball. It felt irrelevant. But as I thought about it more I realised the point it was making. BlacKkKlansman is the story of racism in the 70s, but this racism didn't just go away. The KKK didn't just disband and change their minds. They're still around today. They're still making an impact today. They're still violently assaulting people in the streets today. Including these real-life clips at the end reinforces that the message being told in this movie is important - today. It's not just important history to know about, because it's not just history. It's still happening.The acting in this movie is top-notch as well from everyone involved. John David Washington (son of Denzel) definitely deserves praise for his performance as Ron Stallworth. He holds a natural charisma that makes it hard not to like him. He eases into the performance and makes it so natural that it's easy to forget he's not the real Ron Stallworth. Particular standout moments include his subtle facial reactions to the racism he suffers, particularly early on in the movie, but also later when he's assigned as bodyguard duty for David Duke. Talking of, Topher Grace was exceptional as the charming, down-to-Earth Duke. He definitely embodies that everyman feel that enabled Duke to infiltrate the hearts of Americans. He doesn't come across as a racist at all until his racist remarks start to sneak into his dialogue. Corey Hawkins' small appearance as Kwame Ture is also great, as he delivers a speech to the local black community to inspire them to take a stance and fight back against the systemic racism they suffer on a daily basis. While some of what he says is a bit extreme, Hawkins delivers it in such a way that it's inspirational, and the potential extremism in his words is lost.Adam Driver deserves a bunch of recognition here as well, as Flip Zimmerman, the white detective helping Stallworth out as the white face of Ron Stallworth, KKK sympathiser. His character arc is subtle, but also a very important aspect of the movie for non-black people to latch on to. Zimmerman is a Jewish character, which is another race of people disliked by the KKK. However, being white, this aspect of Zimmerman's identity never had much of an impact on him. He was never slighted against for being Jewish. He didn't even practice Judaism, so his Jewish heritage has even less impact on him. Until he's asked to help infiltrate the KKK. The flip in his position from regarding it as just another part of his job to something more meaningful is a reminder that race issues are not just segregated to the black community. In the words of Zimmerman; '...I never thought much about it, now I'm thinking about it all the time...' That is the kind of impact BlacKkKlansman seeks to achieve in everyone, regardless of ethnicity or background.While I think Spike Lee's walkout of the Oscars when Green Book was announced as the best picture winner was childish, like a tantrum over not winning what he felt he was due, and as much as I enjoyed Green Book as an entertaining movie, BlacKkKlansman probably deserved the recognition more. Green Book was just a movie, the very thing BlacKkKlansman makes a point not to be. While they both tackle racism, BlacKkKlansman feels more genuine and more impactful. Of course they're completely different movies aiming for completely different audiences, but I feel like I can at least understand Lee's feelings watching his movie, that he didn't see as just a movie but as a social cry for help (the upside down American flag at the end is all the evidence of this you need), lose to a piece of entertainment made by white people for white people. Yeah, that would feel like a stick in the gut.BlacKkKlansman is a really good movie. A really, really good movie. It definitely deserved more recognition than it got when it first came out. It balances the lighter more comedic moments with the more important and serious tones perfectly, forcing us to really ask ourselves why we found that moment funny, and how the implications are actually terrifying. If nothing else Spike Lee has earned a whole lot more respect as a filmmaker from me. This movie is dense. There's so many different layers to it. It's hilarious and upsetting in equal measure, it has so much to say and tells most of it in a smart and affecting manner, and even on a technical basis the film looks and sounds great, driven by fantastic performances all round. I give it a high 8/10. Would definitely recommend.",8,2,7,13 August 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Definitely my Favourite Spider-Man movie
","Homecoming was definitely worth it, even if only as another chapter in the sprawling MCU epic. Homecoming skips Peter's origin entirely, which is fine because we maybe don't need to see it again. Instead the film opens in the fallout of the Battle of New York in Avengers, where a privately contracted clean-up crew are replaced by a government-sanctioned team. Embittered and feeling victimised, Adrian Toomes and his crew decide to keep some of the alien tech they salvaged and use it to create powerful weapons to sell on the black market. Not only did they put Spider-Man in the MCU, but they tied his first solo adventure directly into the tapestry of the MCU. It managed to develop a part of this universe we don't really get to see outside of the TV shows; the effect of all these superheroes on your everyday civilian. Peter and his friends literally grew up in a world of superheroes, which as an adult I'm finding hard to quantify (I was already out of school when the MCU even started).If Doctor Strange was a superhero movie revolving around magic and fantasy, Logan was a superhero movie bathed in the light of Westerns, and Guardians of the Galaxy was a superhero movie supplanted into a Space Opera, then Homecoming is a superhero in the world of a John Hughes movie. Or at least that's quite evidently what they were aiming for. Peter Parker is just one in a group of high school teenagers involved in the Academic Decathlon. There's the rich, attractive senior Liz, the moody loner Michelle, the aggressive and vulgar bully Flash, the overweight nerdy kid Ned, and a couple of others too.Some smaller points of contention I have include the music and the action sequences. The action sequences were often too dark and just a blur of indiscernible action. It's hard to tell what's even happening in the movie's grand climax at the end, and not just because it's night time on a stealth plane with debris flying everywhere, and it's not even the only action sequence to suffer from this either.The music as well gets exactly the same criticism that I've given pretty much every other Marvel movie. Come on Marvel, you've been doing this nearly ten years, and this has been a criticism since the very beginning. You need to put more focus on your movies soundtracks! What's worse, this is Spider-Man, he already has his own iconic theme already written and ready to go. We get a sweet orchestral version over the Marvel Studios logo, and that's it. It never appears again. Michael Giacchino has done some good work before, but his work on both this and Doctor Strange has been about as vanilla and forgettable as a soundtrack can get.Tom Holland is hands down the best Peter Parker we've ever had though. He manages to balance the nerdy awkwardness of Tobey Maguire's version with the witty, charismatic turn of Andrew Garfield, giving us the best of both worlds. He manages to be extremely likable even at his most whiny and hormonal, which is absolutely a hard task to fulfil. He also manages to inject some real emotion behind it all as well. Him being crushed under the weight of concrete hits hard because he appears like a kid scared and alone, finally realising how out of depth he really is.The rest of the cast are really good too. Michael Keaton's turn as Adrian Toomes is really well developed and performed, making him one of the better villains in the MCU so far (this year looks to be a promising year for MCU villains). Robert Downey Jr. is...well at this point there isn't any point in talking about his Tony Stark performances any more. What I did like was he was used much more sparingly than the marketing would have you believe. He makes about three appearances grand total, each one brief but effective. Marisa Tomei gives us possibly the best Aunt May we've had, although like Peter's friends she suffers from a distinct lack of screen time. Her casting was a little controversial, but I always thought the traditional depiction of Aunt May was a little weird, I mean, she's his aunt, not his grandmother. The humour of Homecoming was also a big yes. Marvel has definitely doubled down on the more colourful and light-hearted side of superheroes, and Homecoming continues that trend naturally and effortlessly. It's a very funny movie from one-liners to visual cues, to small references. And yet none of it feels shoehorned in (like it did with Doctor Strange). Spider-Man having to run across a field because there's no buildings to swing from was a stroke of genius in the comedic department, and although Ned suffers from a lack of character development, he serves as a great source of comic relief throughout.Spider-Man: Homecoming is easily my favourite Spider-Man movie so far. I was never a huge fanboy of the Raimi trilogy, and while Amazing Spider-Man was great, it didn't feel typically like a Spider-Man movie (and the less said about it's sequel the better). Homecoming manages to be fun and entertaining, while weaving Spider-Man into the very tapestry of the MCU. It's story is engaging throughout, and Adrian Toomes poses as one of the most compelling villains of the MCU so far (which I realise isn't really saying much). Holland is simply perfect. I give Homecoming a solid and comfortable 8/10.",8,2,6,8 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Shaky Opening, but Fantastic Character Work
","The movie starts very shaky. Editing and pacing feels completely off and the character introductions take a bit too long thanks to flashbacks being interweaved with the introductory scene of Waller proposing the squad's formation to her peers. This long sequence of introductions also immediately paints who's important and who isn't. For instance Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Enchantress each get multiple long flashbacks, while Killer Croc, Boomerang, and Diablo just get a little nod to their history, and Slipknot is left out entirely (spoiler, he's the red shirt). Even after the introductions, the set-up still isn't complete, as they then need to assemble the team and create an antagonist for them to go after. After that's over though, and the action starts to kick in, it's nigh relentless. I mean, there really isn't much plot here at all; Waller proposes the formation of the squad, a villain starts to destroy the city, and the squad is hastily put together and sent in.Okay, so plot isn't the film's strong suit, but it's linear simplicity is what makes it as enjoyable as it is. Just sit back and enjoy the craziness that fills the screen. What Suicide Squad lacks in plot, it more than makes up for with character development, particularly for Harley and Deadshot, but Diablo also gets quite a pivotal moment as well. Their flashbacks don't end after the introductions, as we get a few more for each them that delves into their backstory a bit more to show how they got to where they are now. Of course Harley Quinn gets a lot of attention, but Diablo's development is particularly heartbreaking.But back to Harley Quinn. She's a massively popular character and of course Suicide Squad spends a lot of time looking at her. This is her first ever Live-Action incarnation, so I got a massive kick out of seeing her transition from Harleen Quinzel to the villainess we know and love a la Mad Love. Also seeing her and Joker together was exquisite, and I didn't want those scenes to end. Give me a whole movie of Joker and Harley and I'll chuck money at the screen indiscriminately. I particularly loved the recreation of their most iconic comic cover, with Harley in her full Animated Universe costume. Margot Robbie was also probably my favourite casting choice for her (living at least; Brittany Murphy would've been 10/10 perfect, but alas), and she did not disappoint. She managed to delve deep into the character and embrace both her playful, flirtatious side, and her more vulnerable and human side as well. Harley is a character beyond the red-and-black scheme and the high-pitched voice, and Margot Robbie proves that once and for all. Give me more Margot Robbie Harley Quinn WB! More!Then there's Jared Leto's Joker. He features a lot in the promotional material, but don't think that means he plays a pivotal role. I was personally expecting little more than a cameo, but he certainly gets more screen time than that. He's just like a minor annoyance in the background who chiefly appears in the flashbacks. By the third act he's almost completely forgotten about, and early on his presence is literally just as a companion to Harley (somewhat amusingly). As for Leto himself, I can't say I hated his portrayal. He's definitely the sociopathic Joker from more recent iterations; violent, unpredictable, and creepy. However, let's settle this now, he still wasn't as good as Heath Ledger's interpretation.There is quite a bit of humour in Suicide Squad as well. I mean it could've gone further and become DC's version of Deadpool, or Guardians of the Galaxy, or even Kick-Ass, and in some ways it absolutely was, but they could've embraced it wholly and gone all-out black comedy with it and I guarantee it would've worked. They didn't, but it's still a very funny movie. Jai Courtney in particular was great with his comedy delivery as Captain Boomerang. I mean I'm not exactly the biggest Jai Courtney fan in the world, but he did do a fantastic job of Boomerang, and I'll admit competed with Robbie's Harley Quinn as one of the most entertaining characters of the movie.The laughs are balanced out really well with an ear to the more tragic and emotional side of this ragtag group of supervillains as well. It's not all super serious and dark, but when it is, it's actually quite heartbreaking. El Diablo in particular has a really heartbreaking history that rattles the whole squad in their down time. Harley, as I mentioned, also shows her more vulnerable side on a couple of occasions as well, while Will Smith's Deadshot is rooted to humanity thanks to his daughter. Floyd's always been one of the more human members of the team in the comics (or those he features in, at least), and the movie makes no difference there at all.I could talk a little more about it's place in the extended universe, or the use of it's soundtrack (hit and miss), or delve a bit more into the acting work, but I don't feel there's anything interesting enough to say about any of it. Suicide Squad is not the complete trainwreck professional critics would have you believe (surprise, surprise). It's opening moments are badly paced, mismatched, and overly-long, but it starts to find itself from the second act onwards. Plot is so-so at best and the action is entertaining but unmemorable, but the character work is sublime. Every character gets their moment to shine, some more than others I'll admit, but everyone gets their turn. I give Suicide Squad a very entertaining 7/10.",6,0,2,5 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Both Fresh and Generic Simultaneously
","Doctor Strange is the story of celebrated neurosurgeon Stephen Strange who loses the use of his hands in a car accident and seeks one-hundred percent recovery in order to get back to his life's work. This leads him to a mysterious place in Nepal run by what appears to be mystics and monks, but are actually a group of sorcerers and sorceresses that protect the Earth from multiversal threats and unseen dimensions. In time he becomes one of them, and is thrust into a conflict with a rogue sorcerer who seeks to bring the dark dimension into ours.In many ways, you can see how Doctor Strange might be a relic from an earlier Marvel Studios. Despite the claim of never doing origin movies, Doctor Strange is absolutely an origin movie, and makes no attempt to hide that either. It feels a lot like the origin stories of Phase One, mixed with the kind of humour and lightheartedness that permeated early Phase Two. It doesn't help that the character of Stephen Strange is a mirror image of Tony Stark; wealthy, genius, arrogant, charming, joke-quipping. On the surface, Stephen Strange is about as generic as a Marvel movie can get, often feeling like a retread of old ground and things we've seen before.This also extends to, but also simultaneously is undone by the visuals. Yes, the imagery of cityscapes folding in on themselves is reminiscent of that one scene in Inception, but Doctor Strange takes that concept, splinters it, and exaggerates it to levels where it's almost unrecognisable. Doctor Strange is easily the most psychedelic Marvel movie to date, and that includes the folding cities, which appear more kaleidoscopic than anything. There's one scene in particular that is one of the most visual mind-bending sequences I've ever seen, feeling almost 2001 in execution. The Ancient One opens Strange's mind up to the multiverse of hidden dimensions, and he's flung through a psychedelic montage of trippy images that feel like a bad acid trip. Just like the end of Ant-Man, I just wanted this bizarre place beyond the law of physics to be developed further, to take us on a bizarre mind-bender. This is all without mentioning the slow-motion backdrop of snow and lightning, or the extra dimension added thanks to the introduction of magic, including the mirror dimension and the astral plain.As I mentioned though, the tone is on par with some of Marvel's more lacklustre movies (looking at you Iron Man 3), with quips and one-liners aplenty. Some of them are quite funny, others not so. Strange listing through celebrities with only one name is a definite high point, while his cloak flicking his cheeks while trying to look cool is a low. Derrickson also puts his history of horror movies to good use to create a few jump scares that are played for laughs as well, like Strange unexpectedly re-appearing from the astral plain to Christine's surprise.The acting is unsurprisingly top-notch. Benedict Cumberbatch slips effortlessly into the role of Strange, proving that he would be a worthy replacement for RDJ as the franchise's mascot. That said, I did feel like his accent was a bit off. He sounded like a Brit trying really hard to do an American accent, which is pretty much exactly what he was, and that took me out a little bit. Chiwetel Ejiofor was also great as the more straight-edged Mordo, and hopefully he'll be used to good effect to become Marvel's third most memorable villain further along down the line (behind Loki and Wilson Fisk). Tilda Swinton is fantastic as The Ancient One. Haters be damned, she owns the role, and is almost unrecognisable.Unfortunately, as great and talented an actor as he is, Mads Mikkelson feels sorely under-utilised here. Like the majority of Marvel villains before him, he draws the short straw on screen time and character development. He wants to live forever by bringing the dark dimension into ours, and that's the extent of his motivations and backstory. The only reason I will remember him is because he's Mads Mikkelson. Rachel McAdams has her moments, but is again reduced to little more than Strange's on-again-off-again love interest that feels almost archaic these days. Benedict Wong and Michael Stuhlbarg both do the best with what they're given, which is about two minutes of screen time each. Here's hoping they get a little more attention in future sequels.Doctor Strange is not the best Marvel movie out there, and it doesn't quite do enough to mark out it's differences from the rest of the roster (like Guardians did, quite successfully I might add). As the introduction of magic into the MCU, it would have benefited greatly from a more mystical tone, but instead it just felt like a generic Superhero origin story. Whether his powers came from magic or not seemed irrelevant. However, as generic as Doctor Strange feels at times, it has plenty enough going for it, most notably in the visuals department (which required several paragraphs of Digital Artists in the credits), and it is a fundamentally very enjoyable movie that at least flirts with new ideas. I give Doctor Strange a very respectable 8/10.",8,4,8,26 October 2016
Interstellar," A Cross Between Inception and 2001: A Space Odyssey
","Interstellar is Nolan's next big movie, and the best way to describe it is a cross between Nolan's own Inception and Stanley Kubrick's 2001. It has all the long tension of Inception, including cutting between two different building stories so that they reach their conclusion at the same time. This creates a lot of nail-biting suspense, the same as it did in Inception. However, apply that suspense, today's effects, and the modern way of making and presenting a movie to 2001, and you've got Interstellar in a nutshell (complete with off-the-wall, surreal climax at the end).The world is dying, overtaken by dust and dirt, disrupting and killing crops. Humanity is a mess; everyone's a farmer and the quest for science is almost nonexistent. Cooper is an ex-astronaut who, just like everyone else, has resigned to keeping his own farm. However it's not enough for him and he craves space exploration more than ever, so when he finds a binary message in the dirt, he follows it's message into another galaxy to save humanity.Interstellar is a very scientific movie. It's all pro-science, showing us what a world without interest in science would look like, which has become a bit of a hot topic recently it seems. In one scene Cooper points out how the lack of MRI's in the world (having been stripped for farming parts) essentially killed his wife. Likewise there's a certain attention to realism, at least to a point. For example all the space vehicles aren't the pristine, sci-fi gadgetry we've come accustomed to seeing of a future vision, but weathered and efficient. Their interiors look like the interior of the ISS today.However Interstellar isn't like Gravity in that realism is the sole aim. It relishes in it's sci-fi surroundings, playing with somewhat more supernatural elements. The film is permeated with the mystery of ghosts and aliens, and as I mentioned before, the big finale takes a surreal route, not too dissimilar to 2001's LSD sequence. While it has these realistic moments and this bombastic sci-fi moments, it ties them together nicely with some elements that bridge the gap in the middle. Every planet is made to seem like a plausible place to exist, with oceans, mountains, clouds, glaciers etc, however they're also very alien in that they hold features unlike anything we've seen before, such as clouds that have frozen in mid-air, creating a sheet of ice and snow floating above the ground, or tidal waves so massive they're mistaken for mountains. The other way they bridge the gap is by exploring the most up-to-date scientific understandings and taken them a little further. The biggest and most obvious example is of black holes, of which one makes a significant point of the movie. Rather than being a 2-dimensional circle as often depicted, it's a black orb surrounded by swirling light in multiple directions. It plays with gravity and time, but isn't imminently dangerous. It even gives the Nolan's an opportunity to play with the idea of going beyond the event horizon. Physically impossible because you'd die from the increased gravity before you got there, but this is another liberty they take with their sci-fi approach.The visual effects are out of this world (pun intended). They manage to strike the subtle balance between believability and sci-fi fantasy, which makes this alien worlds with their alien features come alive, as if they're actual places that exist and are being explored. My wife did note that Saturn's rendering did just look like an art project, but at the end of the day it's a ball of gas. There isn't really much more detail you can put into it. What did strike me about that scene was the attention to scale. All too often in movies, the ship is portrayed as actually being quite big compared to the planet it's passing or about to land on. The Interstellar ship (Endurance) is just a tiny speck in the corner.Interstellar is a great movie for sure. It impacted me so much I left the cinema in silence, and I spent the last hour getting my mind blown over and over again. However I can't say it's perfect. It plays around with a lot of ideas, but not all of them quite work, the Inception-style cutting to build tension achieves the same results, but generally feels a lot messier as the story lines don't really tie together quite as well, McConaughey's mumble just comes across as trying to hard to win an award, and the Earth-based storyline doesn't hold anywhere near the same amount of suspense, just because it inherently has less at stake. It's also a really long movie, which isn't really a problem for me, but it spends an awful lot of time on a random planet with a random character that doesn't really amount to much beyond offering a HAL-type antagonist. In my opinion they could've stripped that straight down, if not cut it out completely, and saved quite a bit of time without ruining the pacing of the movie. All things considered, I give Interstellar a fantastic 9/10. It's definitely a must-watch, despite it's flaws.",9,2,9,8 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Will having you laughing and crying in the same scene.
","In Bruges is quite simply one of the finest movies ever made, managing the difficult task of being rip roaringly hilarious and gut-wrenchingly emotional at the same time, often in the same scenes. This is Martin McDonagh's signature and he's held it through every one of his films. I admit I wasn't so much a fan of Seven Psychopaths (comparatively), but I think I just need to see it again. Nonetheless it didn't squander my anticipation for his next filmmaking adventure; Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which is getting a hell of a lot of Awards attention, and that couldn't make me happier. Three Billboards is quintessential McDonagh; dark, hilarious, emotional, shocking, quotable, filled to the brim with characters that ooze depth and development. It'll have you laughing and crying at the same moment, on the edge of your seat, and wrapped up in the worlds of each individual character and their own personal story.Three Billboards follows the tale of Mildred who seeks justice seven months after her daughter's rape and murder. Angry at the local police department's perceived lack of action on the case, she buys out three billboards outside her home to call out the sheriff and make her stand. It splits the town, between those who support her, and those who are angered by her actions, and those who just get caught up in the middle, like her son, and the advertising company who owns the billboards.Mildred is an enthralling character to watch. On the surface she's an extremely unlikeable person. She's brash, angry, foul-mouthed, and lacks any kind of tact. She's so blinded by her own grief and anger that she can't see the effect her actions are taking on those around her, whether those actions are morally or legally right or not. But she is only one of many interesting characters in this movie. Three Billboards only has one, unseen villain; the rapist/murderer, and no heroes to speak of at all. Every character exists in their own spectrum of grey, from Mildred herself, to the angry, racist cop Dixon, to the dying Chief Willoughby, to the unsure of himself, but morally grounded Red. None of them are quintessentially good, and none of them are quintessentially bad; just normal people reacting in sometimes expected and other times unexpected ways, as people do.I'll skip to the acting now, because that's also such a huge part of these characters. Frances McDormand deserves every accolade she gets over the coming months for her performance as Mildred. In lesser hands Mildred's character could easily have fallen flat, deep in the realms of unsympathetic protagonist, but McDormand takes this woman and makes her so oddly easy to root for. Sam Rockwell is the other standout. I've been singing his praises for years, as he's always the best part of any movie he's in, but as Dixon he's only eclipsed by McDormand. At first a bumbling idiot quick to anger, Rockwell manages to handle the one-eighty with such convincing dignity that it feels natural and real, and that Dixon is still there. He was a smart guy after all, just not very good at communicating. Woody Harrelson is also fantastic as Chief Willoughby, keeping the film firm in it's moral foundations. The supporting cast are all great as well, from Peter Dinklage to John Hawkes to Caleb Landry Jones (who's had a hell of a career so far). The only real weak link is Abbie Cornish who doesn't really know what to do with herself, and whose accent is so bizarrely confusing it's hard to understand where she's meant to be from.But the exceptional character work is only a part of what makes Three Billboards so good. Narratively McDonagh manages to craft a story full of unpredictable turns without convoluting itself with twists, and never feels the need to answer anything (including a plot-cliffhanger of an ending). The way Three Billboards manages to balance dark, serious, violent, and shocking, with funny, silly, and even a dash of slapstick is fantastic, and there's so many moments that completely subvert expectations. One example is an interrogation between Mildred and Willoughby as they play off one another, brought to a halt by a sudden cough of blood, and the tone just shifts with the click of the finger. Mildred goes from smarmy smartass to mothering human being without missing a step. Another is a sudden escalation of domestic argument that results in a knife to the throat, but is quickly interrupted by an injection of humour from someone walking in unexpected and apologising.In lesser hands these shift of tones would feel haphazard and jarring, but McDonagh somehow manages to keep it all tied together. It doesn't matter that a serious interaction is interrupted by humour (and vice versa), because everything shifts so quickly. For every line that makes you laugh ('Penelope said begets?'), there's a line that punches you in the gut ('I hope you get raped too'), and it just adds to the unpredictability of the story. There's never a moment that ends exactly the way you think it will.Three Billboards is definitely a triumph of filmmaking. It's not perfect by any means (Abbie Cornish), but everything it does right, it really does right. Few movies will take you on as much of a rollercoaster as Three Billboards, and fewer still will drive that rollercoaster by characters as deep and interesting as Mildred, Dixon, Willoughby, Red, Robbie, James, and Charlie. The story, the music, the dialogue, the shifts in tone, the acting, the cinematography (that tracking shot, man), it's all fantastic. I give Three Billboards an unquestioning 9/10. What a start to 2018.

Nightcrawler," A Thrilling Character Study of a Genuine Sociopath
","Nightcrawler, in a nutshell, is about the moral depravity of journalism. Louis Bloom is a true sociopath, lacking any kind of empathy for anyone. In fact the only living thing he seems to show care for is his house plant that has pride of place next to the TV. He's a scavenger and a thief, completely unemployable. That is until he happens upon a car accident on the highway, stops to investigate, and bumps into a news crew filming it. He suddenly gets an epiphany - that's what he wants to do with his life; that's how he can earn himself a lot of money.The film then follows him as he embarks on this project, and each instance sees him push the boundaries of legality and morality that little bit further, until he's trespassing, moving bodies, and even sabotaging rivals. Louis is the extreme embodiment of today's paparazzi. He has no care for his subjects - just getting the best shot of them to earn him the most money. But there's more. He's egotistical, ambitious, manipulative, and curious. There isn't much he won't do in order to further his goals, including playing the people he surrounds himself with with threats and blackmailing. He's an all-round unlikeable guy, and yet he's such an interesting character that you just want to know more about him.That is, undoubtedly due in large part, to Gyllenhaal's exquisite performance. I haven't seen him make a single mis-step in his career (even his English accent in Prince of Persia was better than most), and Nightcrawler is no exception. If anything it only makes him an even bigger force in the acting world. He carries the entire movie and absolutely makes the most of it. It cannot be understated how spot-on his portrayal of a sociopath is. From the trailers I thought he was going to be playing a Jordan Belfort type character, but in reality he plays Louis a lot closer to Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman (American Psycho); a genuine sociopath (by which I mean not the typical Hollywood sociopath/psychopath that plagues slasher flicks). In fact I would probably say Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom is a much closer representation of a sociopath than Bale's Patrick Bateman purely because Bateman is still a serial killer, whilst Louis never actually kills anyone (the majority of sociopaths aren't murderers).Visually, as I mentioned, Nightcrawler definitely mirrors Michael Mann's Collateral. It's the same city filmed in the same way so that it comes alive and becomes a character itself. Much like Collateral, Nightcrawler explores much of the city, showing the different neighbourhoods and different people that inhabit it. It also takes place almost entirely at night with the streets bathed in the orange glow of the streetlights.Nightcrawler is an entertaining character study of an unlikeable guy, which feels like such a rarity these days. The satire angle is also very welcome, even though it satirises a fairly unoriginal concept. I mean there's quite a lot of unoriginality on display in Nightcrawler. We've watched Collateral and we've gotten to know Patrick Bateman. The problem is the comparisons are so obvious. Despite all that it does put an original spin on it though (how many movies have you seen that follow a sociopathic news cameraman?), and what isn't original it arguably does better anyway, so for that I have to commend it. It's thrilling and tense, with a dash of witty humour here and there, and Gyllenhaal's performance is incredible. I give Nightcrawler a solid 8/10 and would certainly recommend it.",8,2,4,4 November 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," Toes the Line Between Feel-Good Entertainment and Gritty Biopic
","The movie starts, as all good movies do, at the beginning. Freddie, known then as Farouk, is a baggage handler at an airport, casually writes lyrics at the bus stop, and goes out to gigs every night. One night he encounters a band called Smile and approaches them about filling in for their recently-absent lead singer. What follows is a management deal, recording studios, and world tours, until Freddie gets too big for his boots, is manipulated by one of his managers, and descends into drugs, parties, and breaking up the band to pursue a solo career. Then the film culminates in his AIDS diagnosis and the band coming back together for LiveAid.One thing that stands out as a bit shaky in the film's storytelling is how insanely rushed the beginning is. Freddie joins the band, the bassist appears out of nowhere, they perform their first gig, and then they sell their van to fuel a recording session, they get noticed, picked up by a management company, and suddenly hit it big overnight. Is that how it really happened? I don't know, but I doubt it. The film paints their career trajectory as amateurs suddenly becoming world-famous professionals, and once there there doesn't feel like there's much growth in them or the bands trajectory, they plateau before descending equally as abruptly. The movie isn't a particularly short movie, so I understand there were time constraints, but it almost felt like they focussed too much on Freddie's fall from grace, elongating the second act, and not enough on his (and their) initial rise or his comeback.That said, ending the movie with the LiveAid concert, cutting out the last six years of Freddie's life, didn't feel like a particularly bad choice. As much as it would have been nice to see a little more of what happened after the comeback and diagnosis, it ultimately meant the movie ended on a high note, with the best scene in the whole movie, filled with inspiration and an infectious crowd. I had to remind myself I was in a quiet cinema and not actually there in the crowd at Wembley, the urge to clap and cheer was so great.As for the nitty gritty, the character work is really well done. Freddie Mercury of course takes centre stage, and we feel we get a good insight into his character. He's a somewhat awkward outcast, who endures a life of self-discovery, and is ostracised and misunderstood because of it. But he's not painted as an angel either. There are a number of scenes where he's a complete dick to those around him, he's clingy to his ex Mary, and he often comes across as completely full of himself, which the film makes a point to justify by making him right almost all the time when it comes to the band. Rami Malek does a really good job here as well. While I think Sacha Baron Cohen was probably a better fit visually (Malek is too short), Malek definitely has the dramatic chops to bring Freddie's private side - as well as his more flamboyant side - to life.The rest of Queen are sidelined a little, but they still get enough screen time to still be a prominent enough presence, particularly in the first and third acts. Gwilym Lee is about as perfect casting as you can get for Brian May. He looks like a young Brian May, and has the guys mannerisms and way of talking down to a tee. Ben Hardy is pretty good as Roger Taylor as well, and gets plenty of chances throughout the movie to show multiple sides of Roger, despite never seeming to age over the course of the movie's fifteen year timeline. And then there's Joseph Mazello (the little kid in Jurassic Park) as John Deacon, who I'm not even remotely familiar with, but he looks the part, and can at least play Bass pretty well, so that's a plus in my book. Aiden Gillen is serviceable in his small role as Queen's manager, Tom Hollander is great as their Lawyer, and Mike Myers makes an (as always) unrecognisable cameo as a Record Producer who doubts Queen's potential early on.The big climax is the LiveAid concert, and it is by far the best sequence of the whole movie. They filmed a recreation of the entire set, but of course time constraints meant it had to be cut down a bit. The set is vast, recreating the stage, the backstage, and the front of the crowd as well. While I felt it a little odd to see the majority of their iconic set recreated and mimed by look-a-like actors, it was a really great opportunity to add in some creativity in camera shots, as well as give us the closest we'll ever get to the performance in high definition, show some of the reactions beyond the stadium, and use it to tie the whole movie together.In all Bohemian Rhapsody is a good little movie. It manages to toe a careful balance between feelgood entertainment, and portraying the darker sides of Freddie's story. His drug use, his vagrant parties of excess, his sexuality, his manipulation by the hands of Paul Prenter, and his diagnosis framed by the rise of the illness are all touched upon just enough without bringing down the mood too much. I'm also amazed at how much Queen I actually knew without ever really clocking it was Queen. If nothing else, that's the mark of an iconic band; when their music is so intrinsically woven into modern culture thirty years later. I give Bohemian Rhapsody a really good 8/10.",8,0,2,30 October 2018
Baby Driver," A Messy Third Act doesn't undermine Baby Driver's Entertainment Value
","Edgar Wright does Drive. I mean, I didn't need any more reason than that to see this movie did I? And neither do you. Like pretty much every film in Wright's repertoire, Baby Driver is a display of such insanely tight direction and writing. Nothing in this movie is accidental, from the obvious foreground to the subtle background. Every cut and every pan is there for a reason, timed and placed for maximum effect. Wright has a hard-on for the little details, and Baby Driver is absolutely brimming with them, from song lyrics written in graffiti in the background, to foreshadowing channel hopping on television, to insignificant lines of dialogue resurfacing later on to great effect.The story is almost not the point of Baby Driver. I'm not going to lie, it's a little lacklustre as stories go. It hits all the right beats, and has some fantastic moments, but it's not particularly deep or complicated. Baby Driver is mainly a character- driven story, and even then certain characters aren't dealt with particularly well (Doc's sudden and out-of-character flip of priorities in the third act definitely stands out as the movie's weakest point). The third act is also overlong and a little messy, interweaving multiple action scenes across a whole day, leaving it's fast pace to get a bit away from the narrative.But as I said, what might be perceived as the most important aspects of a good movie, these are only minor details in the grander scheme of Baby Driver's aim, which is the quintessential marriage of audio and visuals. The movie is absolutely chock full of popular music from every era, from the moment the movie starts to when the final credits roll. Music permeates every scene and is used to such brilliant effect. Every movement on camera is tied to the music's beat, from gunshots to money counting, to character movements and even the rhythm of dialogue. My favourite touch though is when the music disappears, alongside narrative reasoning in the movie, and the audio gap is filled with a single high- pitched note offering the effect of Baby's tinnitus, while simultaneously marking these scenes out as more serious and intense than the rest of the movie.As I've mentioned, every song serves a meticulous purpose in the movie, and the soundtrack is full of songs both iconic and obscure from every era of music, from Simon and Garfunkel and Queen to the Harlem Shuffle and Tequila, to Blur and Beck. Personally very little of it is to my personal tastes, so it's not really a soundtrack I would choose to listen to by itself, but I can't deny that it's an expertly chosen selection of songs. And seeing as there's a song for almost every scene, that's a hell of a lot of music.The choreography of fight scenes and car chases also deserves mention. No CGI or green screen was used, and it shows. While the fights and car chases are smaller and more intimate than what you might find in the Fast and Furious franchise, this is only a strength, allowing it all to be filmed in-camera and, as such, keep its realism and plausibility intact. Baby Driver easily has the best car chases of the year; complex, stylish, real, and above all hugely entertaining to watch.While the character work in the script leaves a lot to be desired, every actor's performance stands on it's own and thanks to great direction by Wright, are left to flourish and dig deeper than the script and dialogue could. Ansel Elgort is subdued, mysterious, quiet and thoughtful, and yet driven by morals not befitting of a criminal. All he wants is to pay off his debt to Doc and carry on with his life like a normal person. Jon Hamm's Buddy is a masterclass on character building, using his handsomeness and charming masculinity to great effect, appearing first as a friend, and then an antagonist without skipping a beat or breaking character. Jamie Foxx is another example of the finest character building I've seen in a long time. His turn as a pure villain is so easy to hate and fear in equal measure, oozing real threat and intimidation in every scene he's in, without being an overly dark spot in an otherwise light-hearted movie. Lily James employs her signature charisma and ability to hit real chemistry with anyone and everyone. She's simply endearing and easy to love in every scene she's in.Baby Driver is also, unsurprisingly, very funny to watch. It's certainly not your typical comedy movie, as each joke is so natural that it doesn't feel like a joke at all. There's a general air of brevity, particularly in the first and second acts that's infectious to watch. There's no possible way to feel bad during this movie. Even once the third act ditches the light-hearted edge and turns more serious, the shift in tone doesn't feel sudden or out-of-place.Baby Driver is a thoroughly entertaining heist flick employing the best use of music in a long time, with some great performances elevating otherwise lacklustre characters to levels higher than they realistically should be. It manages to carefully balance a light-hearted and fun tone with a level of seriousness and threat that keeps the stakes real and high throughout. It's hard to detach yourself from the characters and story, as they take you on a rip-roaring ride through action, romance, comedy, thriller, and musical, often within the space of a few minutes. Would I recommend Baby Driver? Yes, I would recommend Baby Driver. 8/10. I just wish that third act wasn't quite as messy and all over the place, and that Doc didn't just suddenly jump out of character.",8,6,14,4 July 2017
Justice League," We Need the Snyder Cut
","Justice League picks up an undetermined amount of time after BvS. The country still mourns the death of Superman, while Batman is out there taking out Parademon scouts and Wonder Woman is botching the plans of terrorists in London. When Steppenwolf appears to steal a motherbox from the Amazons, they come together to form the team and save the world. Pretty much it in a nutshell. There's no fancy plotting or complicated mysteries. Not even a sub-plot, everything is tied to this one path.Firstly I'll start with the big elephant in the room; the tone. BvS was harshly criticised for being tonally dark, and Warner Brothers has reacted by ensuring Justice League does not fall to the same judgements. Lighter moments are welcome, of course, but it's at the cost of any real threat or suspense. Batman himself almost feels like a completely different character. The brooding, angry Batjerk from BvS is gone, and instead we get a smiling, wisecracking Batman who doesn't really know what to do with himself.But you know what bothers me most about Justice League? It's the stylistic shift in tone; the superficial and aesthetic. Snyder was absolutely not finished with his vision when he stepped down, and Joss Whedon simply could not replicate Snyder's signature style. It shows. It shows really badly. Warner Brothers, wanting to capitalise on the director switch, decided to concentrate far too much on Whedon re-shoots (most of which are terrible) instead of polishing up the already questionable visual effects.Steppenwolf is possibly the worst superhero villain I've seen in recent memory. Beyond being just a deep-voiced antagonist hell-bent on taking over the world, he just looks terrible, like a video game rendering from ten years ago. Cyborg suffers this same fate as well, looking like badly rendered plastic instead of the futuristic alloy he's meant to be made from. The fact they even went so far as to CGI his entire face for some reason as well just makes it worse. Like, you have Ray Fisher's face literally there, why would you CGI it in? And talking of CGI faces, I'm fairly certain Paramount used their contract with Cavill to have a stab at Warner Brothers. He could have easily shaved off the moustache and worn a fake one for M:I 6, or even had it CGI'd back in for a fraction of the cost. Instead we get a half-CGI'd Superman face that doesn't even look like Cavill. Oh god it's awful.The other missing Snyder trademark is his reliance on music. There are some moments that feel intact from Snyder's auditory vision, like the opening of Superman's absence to Everybody Knows by Sigrid, but replacing Junkie XL with Danny Elfman was when my excitement for this movie hit rock-bottom. There is no A-List composer more boring or generic than Danny Elfman, and Justice League just goes to prove me right. The scenes hold no weight in the music at all, instead opting to sound flimsy and wishy-washy instead of punchy or emotional. It just peeters on in the background pointlessly doing nothing and not being guided by the direction of the film at all. What's worse is that it barely even registers the themes laid out in the previous films. But all of this frustrates me so much because there are some genuinely great moments here. I've already mentioned how spot-on the casting was, especially for Flash and Aquaman, but what does remain intact from Snyder is still great too. The League vs Superman is the film's high point, and is Justice League's version of Faora zipping about in Man of Steel, or Batman taking out an army of thugs in a warehouse in BvS, or Wonder Woman stepping into No Man's Land. This scene shows Superman at his most bad-ass and most capable. Before he's just been holding back, but here he lets rip. He headbutts Wonder Woman into the ground from the air, asks Batman if he bleeds, and catches Flash in mid-speed force dash. But then the whole scene ultimately feels pointless because he rushes off and is barely seen again until the third act, leaving the League precisely where they started before deciding to resurrect him (which was equally as rushed and half- baked). Warner Brothers lack faith in their product, in their cast and crew, and have no vision whatsoever. They react and go with the times rather than forging ahead with their own idea. They already did this once with Suicide Squad and look how they turned out. They had the groundwork for a solid superhero franchise that stood out from the pack in tone and artistic merit, but they didn't stick to their guns and gave in to the critics, resulting in a chimera of a movie that can't decide on a tone or a focus. Both Snyder and Whedon are great directors, but they're polar opposites, and asking one to pick up the work of the other is going to result in a mess. I didn't even bother sticking around for the second post-credits scene, because let's be honest, whatever it teases is never going to come to fruition. Warner Bros will probably shelve this shared universe after Aquaman next year. No doubt about it. I give it a 5/10.",4,2,4,21 November 2017
The Thing," A Worthy Cult Classic
","The Thing has become a cult classic over the years, but in case you've been living under a rock, it follows an American research team stationed in Antarctica as they're infiltrated by an alien lifeforce that imitates anything biological, including humans. It doesn't take long before the team realise the creature is around and could be anyone, and what follows is an hour and a half of paranoia and claustrophobia as the team splinters off in distrust of one another and are secretly and unknowingly picked off one-by-one.Perhaps what The Thing is most well-known for are the special effects. In the age before CGI, everything had to be done practically, and The Thing's practical effects are nigh unmatched even today. The creature and its mutated remains are horrifying to look at, but so full of detail. Some moments maybe don't look quite as good, such as someone's head turned into a spider scuttling away, but others like a chest cavity suddenly opening up mid defibrillating and cutting a man's arms off are terrifyingly effective. The sheer breadth of these special effects are amazing as well, from a creature borne of a dog with flailing, whipping tentacles, to a face-eating humanoid, to a giant cave-filling monstrosity. It's a technical marvel and some of the goriest effects around, and compared to the prequel's CGI it shows how superior practical effects can be despite their limitations (case in point, the Xenomorph from Alien is scarier than the one from Covenant precisely because the limitations made it next to impossible to show the full creature in broad daylight).But the gore and visual effects wizardry is only part of what makes The Thing such a landmark horror movie. What actually makes The Thing a true horror movie worthy of watching on Halloween is the isolation it portrays from the team's distrust of one another. Anyone could be the Thing. And often it's revealed to be the guy you didn't even suspect in the first place. The Thing is incredibly good at hiding and blending in with the group. And with everyone insisting they're human, does the imitation even realise they're an imitation? Would you know if you were an imitation and not yourself? The fact the movie never shows anyone actually being assimilated by the creature just amplifies it, and makes you wonder how the process actually takes place. Fear of the unknown is rampant in this movie.My only real complaint would be some of the cuts can feel a bit janky. In order to keep the mystery intact and its cards close to the chest until the right moments, the passage of time never really feels well-defined. The best example of this would be when Fuchs talks to MacReady in the lab and seconds later is startled by a silhouette, follows it outside, finds tattered remains, and then we cut to MacReady mentioning how long Fuchs has been missing. There's no transition between these scenes to help the movie's flow of time. One minute he's there uncovering a potentially big piece of evidence, the next he's been missing for hours and no-one's bothered to look for him or check up on him. There isn't even any implication that he's been attacked, or even at risk of it, until we find his half-frozen, half-charred remains outside.But I mean, there isn't really much more to say about it. It's claustrophobic and mysterious, with gory and disturbing special effects equal to none. Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is subdued and suitably creepy at all times, the use of muted colours to make the practical effects stand out is a subtle stroke of genius, and the ambiguity throughout goes a long way to build up the tension and the ultimate surprises. I give The Thing a solid 8/10. Would definitely recommend.",8,0,1,1 November 2019
Split," An Unequivocal Return to Form for Shyamalan
","I haven't yet seen The Visit, but Split is unequivocally a return to form for Shyamalan. He is well and truly back with his own tropes and tricks and they're wonderful to behold. There's two things Shyamalan has always been synonymous with, and that's suspense and twist endings, and both are back in full force. My heart was racing for the vast majority of the entire movie. He knows how to film and frame a sequence to put you in unease, and punctuate it with movements both sudden and slow, to give the scenes an aura of unpredictability. You could feel the tension in the cinema screening as everyone was brought to the edge of their seats. Entire rows of seats would jolt at sudden jumps as the suspense is built and released, but never lets up. There's a moment where one of Kevin's personalities briefly lets the girls out so they can eat on a table. The fear on the girls eyes as they look for an opportunity to escape is palpable, and the suspense of being in such close, open proximity to an individual so fundamentally unpredictable. This sense of unpredictability is punctuated perfectly by a sudden slam of a knife on the table out of petty frustration, as one of Kevin's personalities is upset that they didn't cut a sandwich in a straight line. The girl a couple of seats over from me jumped so hard that the entire row shook. This is cinema at it's finest.Of course the driving factor of Split is James McAvoy's ability to effortlessly and convincingly shift between multiple different characters. Kevin is the core personality at the centre of it all, but we never really meet him. His body is taken over by a number of other individuals who all fight amongst themselves and oppress each other in a bid to take control. There's Dennis who's OCD drives him to disgust whenever things aren't clean, coupled with a penchant for watching young girls dance. He shares the 'light' with Patricia, a well-spoken, older woman who has her own quirks and desire for control. Dennis and Patricia have taken over in order to usher in a mysterious 24th personality they refer to as The Beast. Their takeover was possible thanks to Hedwig, a 9-year old boy who enjoys dancing to Kanye West, and has the ability to take the light whenever he wants, without restriction from the others. These three are the main ones in control, but under the surface the others are fighting. Diabetic young woman Jade, homosexual fashion designer Barry, and nerdy, fact- spewing Orwell all bubble tentatively beneath the surface, yearning for help whenever they can get a chance. And this is all inside McAvoy's performance, which is nothing short of spectacular. He emphasises each one with their own mannerisms, accents, and body language. He slides into the guise of an older woman just as easily as he can embody the psych of a 9-year old boy.And yet despite the slathering of suspense and dark subject matter, from kidnapping to paedophilia to cannibalism, Split has it's lighter moments that help break it up a bit and make it more bearable. Again, this is almost entirely thanks to McAvoy who's sense of comedic timing and knack for facial expressions owes to some genuinely hilarious moments. Hedwig is the big character to blame for this, being as charmingly innocent as only a child could be. His warning that Casey could be pregnant after an awkward first kiss is hilarious in it's innocence, and his performance to music in front of her is physical humour at it's finest.While I've so far only given praise to Shyamalan and McAvoy, there are certainly other members of the cast and crew who deserve a mention. The sheer levels of suspense and unease wouldn't have been possible without the combined marriage of Mike Gioulakis' cinematography and West Dylan Thordson's sometimes eery and sometimes beautiful score. Anya Taylor-Joy proves that she is a force to be reckoned with, with a performance as Casey that straddles between fearful and patiently wise.Split is, as I've already mentioned, a welcome return to form for Shyamalan. His brand of filmmaking, holding that special something that makes for solidly entertaining viewing, has once again returned thanks to his smaller budget and focus on actors and what limited tools he had available. Split is a suspenseful movie fundamentally about child abuse and the effects it can have once those children grow up. It's full of dark ideas and concepts and offsets them with genuine charm and humour. A solid eight/eight and a half out of ten movie. However that's not the end. The final reveal after the end of the movie somehow changes Split while not actually touching it at all. It's an ingenious twist that not everyone will fully understand, but it's a twist that will forever stick with me as one of cinema's greatest moments. So much so, that it boosts my entire rating up to an incredible 9/10. Go and see Split. Go and see it before the ending is ruined for you.",9,1,9,25 January 2017
Dunkirk," A Relentless Experience that Demands to be seen on the Big Screen
","Nolan is great at crafting experiences, and Dunkirk is absolutely an experience. It demands a screen the size of a large wall, and a surround system that can handle extremely loud and deep noises. He puts you right in the shoes of his characters, with minimal dialogue, and encourages you to strap yourself in for the ride.However, what did surprise me, is that Nolan somehow still managed to weave an unconventional narrative into Dunkirk. The plot follows three different viewpoints; The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. Each one is title-carded with a timeframe. The Mole is one week, The Sea is one day, and The Air is one hour. For a long time this bugged me, as I couldn't work out what these timeframe's signified. Eventually I figured out that they were the amount of time each viewpoint inhabited. The viewpoint of the soldiers and officers at The Mole spanned a whole week, the viewpoint of the sailor and his young crew took place over a single day, and the pilots only had an hour of fuel when they're first introduced. Except rather than introducing these viewpoint chronologically, Nolan introduces them all at once. These three different timelines all running concurrently to one another creates a staggered sense of flashback and foreboding. We see characters drift from one viewpoint to another and back again, completely out-of-sync. He manages to take this, and somehow still craft an enthralling plot line that references and explains itself, resulting in twists and turns that otherwise would not have been present, and prevents it from getting too convoluted and confusing.The camera work is simply spectacular. We're put underwater with the soldiers, or bobbing on the surface. We're forever peering over ominous sand dunes, or crammed into Spitfire cockpits. We see fire from below, and a stalled engine from above. We see bombings from the air, from the sea, and from the land. One of my favourite pieces of camera work was from a camera strapped to the side of a boat as it capsizes, with the water level slowly peering in from the left until it consumes the deck, as we watch soldiers desperately jumping off. We're put on that boat as it tilts and goes down. There's a few shots of genuine beauty as well though. Shots that just linger with a moment and let it wash over you. One of the final scenes of a Spitfire sat on the beach in flame definitely springs to mind as one of the most impactful single-shots of the movie.The music and sound design has a lot to answer for as well. This movie can be incredibly loud, which just immerses you even more. Each gunshot is a punch to the gut, each bomb explosion a skipped heartbeat, and each screaming air raid a terrifying experience that scares you to your core as it would the soldiers on the beach awaiting their fate. Then there's Hans Zimmer's score, which is about as Zimmer as you can get. I mean the film literally opens with a Zimmer clock tick tock tick tock. It never lets up either, this ticking rhythm is kept up for literally the entire movie. It's solid scoring from the very opening moments until very late in the movie, and it's relentless. Just tick tick tick tick tick for over an hour. The orchestra builds on this rhythm and the music fluctuates around it, but the ticking is ever present. Nothing instills a never-ending sense of suspense better than Zimmer's score here. And it makes the eventual silence at the end even more significant, when the panic and race against time is finally over, and there's just nothing, and it's a massive sense of relief. Variation 15 of Edward Elgar's Nimrod is also integrated into Zimmer's score so well, creating a massive sense of hope in the film's closing moments that it's hard not to smile and feel completely satisfied.The thing with Dunkirk though, is that it is an experience first and foremost. It tells the story of the evacuation of Dunkirk, not the story of a particular character. As such, there is no depth to any of the characters. They're all just tools to the story. Dialogue is at a bare minimum, with much of the exposition left to visual, sound design, and character expressions. The Acting from all involved did exactly what was required though. The silent exchange of looks between Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, and Harry Styles on the beach says all that needs to be said. The nod of approval from Mark Rylance to Tom Glynn-Carney is all that needs to be said. The wave from Jack Lowden to Tom Hardy is all that needs to be said (except in this case twice, because it has completely different meanings depending on your viewpoint). The salute from James D'Arcy to Kenneth Brannagh is all that needs to be said. The shaking and quivering of Cillian Murphy is all that needs to be said.As I've mentioned, Dunkirk is an experience. It demands a big screen and massive sound system. It's not about characters, it's about the event, it's about what it was like to be there. It immerses you in the deep end and doesn't let up until the sense of relief at the end. It weaves a surprisingly unconventional narrative in and out of one another, manufacturing twists and revelations and opening up different perspectives of the same events. While Dunkirk is light on character and emotion, it's yet another masterclass of technical filmmaking from Nolan. I give it an 8/10.",8,3,9,25 July 2017
Ratatouille," Visually and Emotionally Beautiful
","Ratatouille came out during the height of my teenage years. You know how it is, kids movies are for kids and I'm far too mature for that. Unfortunately I never went back when I actually matured enough to appreciate movies no matter who their target audience is. I'm really wishing I had sought out this movie sooner. I kept shrugging it off as just a movie about a cooking rat, as great as Pixar can be, it wasn't a concept interesting enough to get me excited about it. But of course, Pixar being Pixar, Ratatouille is about so much more than that.We follow Remy, a rat with a supernatural sense of smell in the French countryside. While his family are content munching on the human waste that gets thrown out, Remy is much pickier. Much, much picker. He craves the purest essence of food, the magic of taste, of combining ingredients, preparing them in different ways, and savouring every delectable bite. He regularly sneaks into a nearby cottage to get his fix of the finest fruit and vegetables, and happens upon a famous chef who appears on television. He's inspired by this approach to food, and his foray into cooking and spices lands him and his colony in big trouble, seeking new pastures in the underbelly of Paris. This is where Remy separates from his family and finds a new home in the prestigious restaurant of the famous chef he idolised. Before long he's discovered by the garbage hand, and together they turn the local food industry on its head, with Remy as the food genius, and Linguini as the human puppet desperate not to lose his job.So far so family friendly. It's a fun romp about two characters who forge a bond and dependency on one another, leading to some tense and thrilling moments, as well as some absolute slapstick gold. I'm not ashamed to say that watching Linguini flailing around as Remy pilots him is truly hilarious. I caught myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions. Pixar's animation department bring in their undeniable comedy timing and crack out their catalogue of amusing facial expressions that never get old. Remy and Linguini's practice run in Linguini's apartment is endless hearty laughs.But as the movie goes on, something else starts to emerge. A tale much more mature in nature. Ratatouille evolves into a story about creating art, and critiquing said art. It becomes a story about the relationship between artist and critic. It becomes a story about how art can affect us all, to our deepest cores, and how art in all its forms can be appreciated. This is something that hit really hard for me. It's what I practically built this review blog on; the idea that even blockbuster popcorn flicks have their place, can be appreciated for their artistic value, that art is not about its technicalities, but about how it makes us feel. Or as Ratatouille's film critic says at the end; '...the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.' In a poignant monologue at the movie's close, Ratatouille transcends the simple designation of a family blockbuster, and becomes its own slice of art. 'Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.' It's an ending that hit me in so many places simultaneously, and trumps the familial emotional value Pixar often falls on. Instead it falls on the emotional impact and true love of art in all its forms. 'The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.' Ratatouille tried something new, and deserves every ounce of praise it has earned. It avoids clichÃ© and predictability in the best ways, offering us an ending equal parts poignant and bittersweet, in probably the most un-fairy tale ending I've seen from a family movie.Before I wrap this up, I do want to touch on Ratatouille's more technical aspects as well, because while Pixar are great at emotional gut-punches, they're also great at making groundbreaking animation. Remy and his rat colony are brought to life exquisitely, often looking like real rats, with every hair individually rendered, and the way they move. And yet it's balanced brilliantly with the more cartoony aspects of the character designs. Remy enjoys being somewhat anthropomorphised without losing his adorably animalistic nature. The human designs are also leagues ahead of where Pixar were when they first began only a decade previously. Again the designs are intrinsically cartoonish, with the lanky, somewhat goofy-looking Linguini, the short and hilariously disproportioned Skinner, the huge chin and forehead of Horst, and the on-the-nose deathliness of Anton Ego. Then again Colette enjoys the luxury of being entirely animated by female artists, never falling victim to male interpretations of cartoon women (see: Elastagirl). And yet Ratatouille remains oddly detail focussed, ensuring the right parts of a chef's uniform behave has they should when wet or dirtied, that food decays realistically, that the rats move, skitter, and sniff about like actual rats. You can rarely fault Pixar's approach to animation, but Ratatouille doubly so. There is just one slight moment that doesn't quite look right, and it's after Linguini jumps in the river. The water on his skin makes him look shiny and plastic rather than actually wet. One fault in a movie brimming with beauty isn't too bad going though.What else is there to say? I can't believe I snoozed on Ratatouille for so long. It's a beautifully poignant film about creating, critiquing, and digesting art. It's about prestige cooking, but it's themes could apply to anything. It's hilarious. It's heartwarming. It's sad. It's thrilling and full of suspense. But that ending hit me harder than any typical tearjerker could. I give Ratatouille a resounding 9/10. It's definitely Pixar's most undersung achievement.",9,0,0,12 April 2020
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The Perfect Marriage of Two Continuities
","Days of Future Past is a brilliant amalgamation of both eras of the X-Men franchise. After Origins and First Class, it was presumed we'd never see the traditional cast set in the modern day again. Then Wolverine came along set almost ten years after the events of Last Stand, and it also teased Days of Future Past with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen appearing in the post-credits scene. Days of Future Past, in that respect, feels like having your cake and eating it too. It's a direct sequel to two completely different movies in the franchise, containing the casts of both eras, and using the perfect source material to do so. It ties everything together really nicely by default of having all these actors together.However, while it does tie the two strands together, it also takes gross liberties with continuity. If you watch all seven movies in release order, you'll start to notice a number of things don't add up. The most crucial is, after Last Stand, how are Xavier and Magneto alive and fully operational? Xavier died, and Magneto lost his powers, but they're quite obviously around and kicking twenty years later. Obviously there are explanations. The end of Last Stand hints at Magneto's powers returning, and Xavier mentioned transporting his conscious to another body, however none of these are even mentioned in Days of Future Past. You're expected just to go along with it. Another fairly crucial bit of continuity is Wolverine's claws. Obviously in 1973 they're not coated in adamantium, while in 2023 they are. Problem with this is that Wolverine lost the adamantium coating at the end of Wolverine, which is set in the present day. It's hard to believe Wolverine would willingly get his claws re-coated in the ten years between. There's a number of other little niggles, but they're honestly not worth pointing out.Balancing that out, however, are a number of great nods to previous events. Obviously a lot is carried over from First Class as it picks up on Magneto, Xavier, and Beast almost ten years later. For me, the greatest nod to the running plot of the franchise, however, is that of Wolverine's origin. I mean when you really think about it, Origins is pretty much redacted, but I think almost everyone did that in their heads already, so it's no loss. The running plot of Wolverine's turmoil is touched on once again here as he finds himself face-to-face with a young William Stryker. This emotional jarring has some pretty huge ramifications on the story, which is great, and it's picked up again at the end to explain how he's still got adamantium grafted to his bones.The story itself is pretty great, although I can't say it's without it's holes (the most crucial of which I've already mentioned). Being a time-travel story, it will always take a number of watches and some thinking through to really connect all the dots and make sure everything works, but with Days of Future Past, it doesn't even matter. The wider continuity has little to no effect on the story the movie wants to tell. There are nods here and there, but you can tell they just wanted to tell a good X-Men story without having to worry about everything, and they did. There's some great character work here, with Xavier at his lowest point, Magneto slipping into his villainous persona we all know, Mystique's struggle of choice over destiny, and Wolverine's past constantly coming back to him. It's also pretty unpredictable. Once we entered the third act I just thought to myself; 'I know we're nearing the end, but I don't have a clue how they're going to solve this.' But what I liked most was how the future glimpse wasn't merely used a bookend, but it's revisited a number of times throughout, ramping up the tension and raising the stakes even higher than they already were.The visuals were pretty great, as were the action scenes themselves. The post-apocalyptic future that needs to be avoided is bleak. New York City is in ruins, and everywhere is patrolled by these nigh-invincible Sentinels (that actually look a lot like the Destroyer in Thor). Beyond the landscapes and sentinels, the effects work here is pretty great too. It all looks quite obviously futuristic with bizarre flying carriers for the sentinels and holographic gadgets, but also the mutant abilities are rendered really well. Colossus and Iceman of course turn their skin into another material, but there's other's like Blink's portals and Bishops...ability, whatever the hell that was. There's also a great scene with Quicksilver taking on a whole room of guards in his own sweet time, and having a load of fun with it; moving the guards so they punch themselves, or trip over nothing, moving the bullets so they miss their targets, all the while listening to some pretty at-odds music. Days of Future Past isn't the best film, it's not the best superhero film, hell it's not even the best X-Men film (although on that last one, it's not far off), but it's a thoroughly enjoyable romp nonetheless. If nothing else, it's an excuse to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen together once again. It's the perfect way to tie together the franchise's separate continuities and give us fans the best of both worlds. There's also a cheeky post-credits scene, so make sure you stay for that. We were literally the only ones waiting for it (amateurs), and while it probably means more to those who read the comics, it implies some pretty monumental things to come in Age of Apocalypse. I give Days of Future Past a very good 8/10.http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,2,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," I Have Full Faith in the Russo's Infinity War
","Civil War is the culmination of the last eight years of movies. It is a direct successor to both Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron, and references almost everything else. After the catastrophic losses of life in New York, Washington, and Sokovia, the UN calls for the Avengers to be put under political scrutiny. When the Wakandan King is killed by what appears to be the Winter Soldier, lines are drawn on both sides, with Iron Man supporting the need for supervision, while Captain America fears it'll just prevent them from doing what needs to be done.As far as stories go, Civil War is a lot more complex than simply pitting one hero against another. Everyone has their own loyalties, their own ideals, and their own perspective, and managing to not only resolve the Winter Soldier plot, but also make it an integral part of what could otherwise have been a much shallower movie deserves all the praise it can get. There's a lot going on, and yet no strand is left behind or underdeveloped, nor does the movie feel like a mess. Every sub- plot and character cameo makes sense and plays a part in the grander story.The current Avengers team isn't particularly large, especially when you factor in the absence of both Thor and Hulk, so both sides needed a little fleshing out. Black Panther gets his big debut here, but I'll resist calling it a cameo as, much like the Winter Soldier, he's an integral character with a sizeable role. He's not just there for the big clash, he's a major player from beginning to end. Black Widow, Falcon, Iron Man, Vision, and Scarlet Witch all make appearances as well, but all of them are fairly integral. At times (unsurprisingly) Civil War feels less like a Captain America movie, and more like another Avengers film. It reaches fever pitch when we get the hero-vs-hero clash at the airport, and each side gets some extra hands and surprises, including Ant-Man, Hawkeye, War Machine, and Spiderman himself. And yet, no character feels like dead weight. I now have full faith in the Russo brothers and their vision of Infinity War with sixty-something characters.What Civil War manages to do really well is make it all personal. The collateral damage the Avengers inflict actually means something to each of them. In that regard, it's a fairly emotionally-driven movie. Scarlet Witch feels guilty for her abilities, Captain America feels responsible for Winter Soldier, Iron Man feels supervision is exactly what they need. The bonus of this is that neither side comes out as the villain. There's no right or wrong, just opposing opinions.This becomes especially apparent with the main villain Colonel Zemo. Marvel have always struggled with villains, hitting gold only once with Loki (we honestly haven't seen enough of Thanos yet to judge). Crossbones makes a very minor villainous appearance, which I was a little disappointed in, but while Zemo isn't a revolutionary Marvel villain, he shows more depth and motivation than any Marvel antagonist before him. He's just a guy who lost his family and blames the Avengers, and yet the treatment of him here makes him an almost sympathetic character.As far as action goes, there's a lot of punch-ups. A lot of them. The vast majority of action is hand-to-hand combat, with superheroics thrown in every now and then. This is one of the many elements that made The Winter Soldier so enjoyable: It wasn't overly flamboyant. The Russo's have tapped into that again, but with more of them this time around, it can get a little tiresome. The exception being the airport clash, which is another punch-up, but with a bit more snazz to it. It's also pretty funny as well, especially thanks to the inclusions of the newbs Ant-Man and Spiderman. A lot of thought was put into that long sequence to make sure everyone got their moment, and it pays off big time.Civil War is definitely a worthy addition to the Marvel franchise, letting them show off everything they have, including some hints at what's yet to come. While it does embody some of the elements that made Winter Soldier so great, it unfortunately pales in comparison in my opinion, but not by much. There's a twist here as well, and even though it packs a punch, it doesn't pack quite as big a punch as Winter Soldier did. I'm still in disbelief that they managed to intertwine so many different plots and angles and make it all feel coherent and necessary though. I give Civil War a must-see 8/10, edging close to a 9. It was at least a better Avengers movie than Age of Ultron.",8,4,8,29 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Two Stories that Barely Connect
","When news of a new franchise set in the Harry Potter universe surfaced, I have to admit I was underwhelmed. Like anyone else, I craved more Harry Potter movies (or at least movies set in that universe). I felt that there was still so much to explore in J.K. Rowling's world. That said, one of my least favourite actors in an Americanised wizarding world chasing down creatures accidentally set free was not my idea of something that needed to be explored. I wouldn't say I had zero interest, but I certainly wasn't hyped for it. But as the release date started to near, new details started to appear. The one that intrigued me most was the presence of Gellert Grindelwald, who was undoubtedly one of the most short-changed characters in the last couple of Harry Potter movies. Now this was some history that I could get behind. This is more like what I wanted for a Harry Potter spin-off franchise.This is, unfortunately, where my biggest problem with Fantastic Beasts lies. How do you connect the story of Newt Scamander finishing up his famous textbook on magical beasts with the reign of Voldemort's predecessor? The answer is you don't. Fantastic Beasts felt like a movie with two unconnected narratives that are strenuously linked by coincidence and right-place-right-time. I went in apprehensive of how important the Grindelwald plot line would actually be, but the opening scene gave me a glimmer of hope that he would be instrumental. By the time the credits rolled, it was apparent that he's included for little more than reference and franchise building in future sequels. In truth, that's all Fantastic Beasts really is, at least narratively. It's an introduction to a larger tapestry. It gets us accustomed to all the major players, embroils them in a scatty, underdeveloped story, and then pretty much says '...until next time'.But what about the world building? I'll admit that with the initial announcement, the only thing that particularly intrigued me was the exploration of the American wizarding world; seeing how this hidden society acted and behaved across the pond, nearly a century ago. In this respect I felt a little disappointed as we don't really get a whole lot in this department. It's a two hour movie that has to squeeze in introductions, Scamander's escaped beasts, Grindelwald references, and a plot about a suppressed young wizard, leaving little room for any kind of look into this new world. We see the MACUSA headquarters, and a shady little club run by a goblin gangster, and we get some exposition about the relationship between witches and wizards, and nomaj's (American muggles), but we get little more than a brief mention of Ilvermorny, the American school of wizarding, and the supposed references to Native American culture were so small and insignificant that I must've completely missed them.What we do get though is an intimate look at some fantastic beasts. This is the film's biggest strength, and probably rightly so considering it's title. While only a handful actually escape, and each are rounded up surprisingly easily and quickly, we do get a look inside Scamander's briefcase (which is basically a wildlife preserve version of the TARDIS) and all of the other creatures he keeps in there. The sheer amount of creativity and imagination put into the creation of these creatures is nothing short of staggering. As Kowalski remarks 'I can't be dreaming. There's no way I'm smart enough to imagine all of this.' There's an invisible primate that can see potential immediate futures, bird-snakes that grow and shrink to fill their surroundings, a rhinoceros-type creature that injects magma from it's horn, and the star of the show is a little marsupial whose pouch can house an infinite amount of shiny things.Finally the acting and character work. Eddie Redmayne, as much as I dislike him, was at least tolerable doing his best Eleventh Doctor impression. He was clumsy and a bit haphazard, but remarkably likable, and certainly knew what he was talking about. Dan Fogler was pretty great with his wide-eyed expressions at almost everything, and hogged the movie's most emotional moments. He's undoubtedly the stand-in character for the audience to latch onto as we're introduced to new beasts and thrust through this world that we're not readily equipped for. Alison Sudol is quite entertaining as the mind-reading, flirtatious Queenie, but her sister, played by Katherine Waterston, I just found annoying. Tina is meant to be an ex-auror, but I did not, at any point, believe she could hold any kind of authority or power over anyone, let alone magical criminals.For Fantastic Beasts itself, it's splintered, unconnected narratives will surely get tied together a little more in later instalments, but for now it just felt a bit like throwing things at the wall and seeing what stuck. While the menagerie of beasts befitting of their title was certainly entertaining, and I'd love to see more of them, I felt Fantastic Beasts just lacked a little bit of the magic that made the Potter franchise so solid. We'll see where the franchise takes us, because I feel it's a little hard to judge one fifth of the sprawling narrative we're yet to see. I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and enjoyable 7/10.http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",7,1,3,23 November 2016
Avengers: Endgame," I Loved it 3000
","The film opens with Clint Barton on his family farm about to have a picnic just before the Snap of Infinity War, and he's left alone as his family mysterious disappears into dust. Yes, it's as heartbreaking as it sounds. We cut to Stark and Nebula aboard the Milano after twenty-odd days in the void of space, hopeless and running out of essentials. Stark has practically given up when Captain Marvel appears and carries them back to Earth. The post-credits scene of Captain Marvel never actually features in Endgame, and I feel like it was ultimately something too important to leave to another movie (oh look, my first criticism). Chronologically Barton's family gets dusted, jump forward a couple of weeks when the Avengers have Fury's pager trying to work out who it's calling when Carol Danvers appears. Presumably they persuade her to back into space to try and find Tony. It's a crucial piece of the early puzzle to make sure everything flows, and it was left out. Redundant after Captain Marvel? Maybe, but it would've been nice anyway, just to keep Endgame complete.From here the Avengers fix up the Milano and fly off to confront Thanos, a now broken and frail man living peacefully off the land. In the first real subversion of expectations, he offers them no fight and he's promptly dealt with, less than half an hour into the movie's runtime. So where does Endgame go now that it's villain is dead with two and a half hours left to go?! The Quantum Realm of course! Don't worry I'm not going to give a running commentary of the whole film (because hopefully if you're reading this you've seen it already anyway), but with the infinity stones destroyed, they hatch a plan to go back in time, steal the stones before Thanos ever has them, and snap half the universe back into existence. Of course things go wrong along the way, people die, others are dragged into the mess, the plan has to be improvised, and it all culminates in a monumental battle comparative in scale to Return of the King.Now I'm going to get this off my chest now as it's what I'm most keen to talk about, and that's all the callbacks, references, and cameos. Oh my god the movie is full of them, and each one surprised me for a number of reasons. Once the Time Heist begins, we are of course thrust back to the events of a number of previous MCU films. We go back to the Battle of New York in Avengers, we go back to the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy on Morag, and yes, we also revisit Thor 2. To avoid referencing these movies in these scenes would've been impossible, the but the opportunity is also used to drop in some other movies and events. The Ancient One from Doctor Strange appears, Jasper Sitwell, a SHIELD agent all the way up to Winter Soldier appears alongside Crossbones (as well as Cap standing in a crowded elevator with them all to boot), we see Starlord singing and dancing to himself on Morag, Thor has a tender reconnection with Frigga, Edwin Jarvis from the Agent Carter TV show marks the first crossover from TV to film, but the one that really surprised me was Alexander Pierce. Freaking Robert Redford came back for a cameo! Then there's all the additional cameos elsewhere, and alternate aliases too (like Hawkeye being Ronin, Banner and Hulk living together as Professor Hulk, and Pepper Potts finally taking up the mantle of Rescue)Seriously, this movie has possibly the craziest castlist ever assembled for a single film, and every single one of them slays it. The vast majority of them get stylised credits as well making for a special moment in lieu of an actual post-credits scene, with the original six Avengers literally signing off from the franchise. I admit, I choked up a bit at this point. Nothing made Endgame feel more final than those credits. So here's a little game, I'm going to list every actor I remember seeing, and you've got to pin them to a character. But also, this will display just how crazy this castlist is. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L Jackson, Brie Larson, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ty Simpkins, Cobie Smulders, Josh Brolin, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Benedict Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong, Tilda Swinton, Don Cheadle, Danai Gurira, Chadwick Boseman, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi, Tom Hiddleston, Rene Russo, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Tom Holland, Marisa Tomei, William Hurt, Robert Redford, Frank Grillo, Hayley Atwell, James D'Arcy, John Slattery, Natalie Portman, Linda Cardellini, Ross Marquand, Callan Mulvey, Yvette Nicole Brown, Hiroyuki Sanada, and of course Stan Lee himself. For anyone counting, that's nearly twenty academy award nominees.All right, I think that's enough raving for a minute. Let's kick back for some ranting, because Endgame still wasn't perfect, not in my opinion. The biggest one for me (which is still comparatively a niggle) is how it contradicts itself on time travel. Time travel is a huge part of Endgame, and they explain it away nice and neatly, without risk of confusing things or retconning previous film entries. Going back and changing things doesn't affect the current timeline, the timeline of our characters, the timeline we've been following all along. Instead every change creates a new, separate timeline. There will be a timeline where Thor loses his hammer for a brief moment during the dark elves assault on Asgard, there will be a timeline where Loki escapes after the Battle of New York with the Tesseract, there will be a timeline where Thanos and his armies just up and disappeared around the events of Guardians of the Galaxy, there will be a timeline where Starlord doesn't find the Orb, there will be a timeline where Howard Stark got advice on how to be a father from a 'stranger'. But most crucially there will be a timeline where Cap and Peggy grow old together. A completely separate timeline. This is where Endgame breaks its own rules, as an old Cap appears just sitting on a bench nearby. For starters why did they decide to set up the time travel device in order to close the loops near some random old guy on a bench? But more importantly how is there an old Cap there when the timeline he went back to would have diverged from the current one? We didn't need a whole monologue about living his life and literally passing the torch over to Falcon. It was redundant, didn't make sense to the film's own logic, and in a way undercut the emotional punch of Cap's eventual fate right at the end of the film.It also creates problems, moreso than anyone else, for Spider-Man. Half the people on the planet are five years older. In adults this isn't quite as noticeable and life goes on, but for Peter he's just a teenager. Five years at that age is huge. Cassie Lang is now a teenager as well when she was just a kid during the snap. Half of Peter's friends will have grown-up and left school, gone to college, maybe even moved out, have jobs, and started paying bills. If Far From Home doesn't address this, we're going to have some problems. But that aside what are the odds all the major characters of Spider-Man were all snapped and will come back exactly as we expect them? That just feels way to convenient!Cap v Cap was amazing, as was the 'I can do this all day' exchange between them. The constant references to Winter Soldier were amazing, what with Pierce and Crossbones back, as well recreating the elevator scene, Cap whispering hail Hydra (in reference to the comics), and of course Sam saying 'On your left' to Cap as Doctor Strange opens a whole bunch of portals around him. Then there's Cap wielding Mjolnir after causing it to nudge in Age of Ultron. All things considered, Cap had an exceptional send-off in this movie. Tony had a lot of great things too. He got the family he wanted in Infinity War, he finally got Pepper to embrace the suits and become Rescue, he was sent off with his 'heart', the mention of cheeseburgers made made me want to blubber like a baby, and even Harley from Iron Man 3 made a brief appearance! In fact Age of Ultron got a lot of nods as almost every single element of Tony's vision was met; the broken shield, the Chitauri worms, space, Black Widow's death.Thanos was great too. Early on you can see the toll the stones had taken on him. He was a shadow of his former self, basically succumbing to his fate. When we go back and meet younger Thanos at the height of his ambitions, he's so much more menacing. In a way he sort of reverts back to being a generic superhero villain who just seeks the end of the universe, but he's in full Mad Titan mode before Gamora's betrayal in Guardians of the Galaxy, and we've seen how capable he can be even without the stones in Infinity War. Now he has a double-bladed sword-glaive thing and it's awesome!Yeah, Endgame was pretty damn amazing. It was the perfect culmination of everything. It sent-off our original heroes with the most perfect endings, and gave each and every one of them a moment to shine, accommodated heaps of fan-service without getting schlocky, and gave the bittersweet conclusion we as fans needed. It took us in directions we never expected, no matter how rampant our theories and rumours became, no matter how hard the trolls of us tried to spoil it for everyone else. There's so much in this movie, but it never feels rushed, and it's three hour length never drags or feels too long. It's not a perfect movie for me, it never will be, and if I'm honest Infinity War is still my favourite film of the entire saga. But all-in-all I couldn't be happier. I give Avengers Endgame well-deserved and emotional 9/10. Godspeed!",9,2,6,27 April 2019
It Follows," One of the Finest Horror Movies of Recent Memory
","Just like it's antagonist, It Follows moves along just slow enough to build the atmosphere, but just quick enough to keep it from feeling like a dirge to watch. We follow Jay who unwittingly takes the curse from a handsome peer she's dating. He kindly lays out the curse to her, and shows her the Follower so she knows what to expect, and then dumps her on her doorstep and disappears, leaving her to survive this ever-present threat to her well-being, while simultaneously getting her friends in on it to help her out.Crucially, the story knows not to reveal too much about anything. The Follower is never named, and the only things we know about it are what we're told by one of the characters, who is at best taking a good guess. This leaves a lot of wiggle room not just for the writer to shake it up a bit when required, but also for the audience to ponder long after the film has ended. What happens if you go overseas? What happens if the curse reverts back to someone who has already died? Can it climb? Can it swim? How much reasoning does it really have? And importantly, what would you do to shake it? The ambiguity is also present as the film starts to reach its climax. There's a couple of moments that are deliberately left open, and your interpretation of what happens between cuts affects how you view the movie's final act. For instance, Jay sees a group of three guys on a boat and swims out to meet them, but we cut before any implied sexual activity. Did she go through with it, or did she change her mind? Depending on which interpretation you take may lead you into different avenues with the film's ending.On this point the film has a lot to say, but what that is exactly is also open to interpretation. Horror movies are at their best when they have a metaphorical or satirical element. It Follows absolutely has some of these elements, even if they might not be that obvious. Even when viewed on a surface-level basis, It Follows is a strong film, but when you start to delve deeper and pick up on all these tiny little details, a new narrative starts to emerge. What does the Follower represent? Is it a sexually transmitted disease like HIV? Is it a metaphor for sexual maturity? Does it mark a loss of innocence and running away from responsibility? Does it try to say something about abuse, and how the abused often become the abuser? Is it an article on promiscuity? The fact that this movie can touch any and all these themes at the same time is a display of expert writing and attention to detail.Talking of detail, there's so much here once you start to scratch the surface. The use of colours, clothing, and the symbolism of water are all extremely important in picking up on the subtler themes. The Follower, in all of it's seen guises, appears in white, either in underwear, nightwear, or completely naked. No-one is seen in red until they've contracted the curse, and blue is a prominent marker for innocence. Water, also being blue, proves to be a big thing in the movie. It both precludes the Follower and marks as it's weakness. A number of scenes take place on the beach or by the shore, whether it's the girl's last stand at the beginning, or the last place Jay and Hugh go before doing the deed. The pool in the back garden is a comfort of simpler, more innocent times, while the pool that features as the stage for the climax hearkens back to Jay and Paul's first kiss when they were kids. The draining of the former and the colouring of red of the latter are sure to have some kind of deeper meaning behind them, depending on which subtext metaphor you like the sound of most.As if the writing and direction wasn't enough display of It Follows being a mastercraft, it has style out of the wazzoo. The cinematography is on overdrive, always aware of the angles it's creating and the frames it lives in. It focuses on the foreground while making an effort not to obscure the background and whatever may be lurking back there. Attaching the camera to the foot of a wheelchair so that it shakes and shudders as the chair does is disorientating, and a full circular rotation around a high school hallway reveals new details with each pass. Even when the cinematography isn't being obviously clever, it composes each scene in such a way that is oddly pleasing to the eye, while also maintaining it's dreamlike surreality that builds the atmosphere. The combination of camera placement, lighting, and colour give the movie an aesthetic quality that's often worth framing.The music deserves mention as well. Composed by Disasterpeace, it has a very John Carpenter feel to it, while also not feeling dated. It's not full-on 80s synthwave, but it errs pretty closely. Themes weave in and out and prove to be such an important ingredient to the film's atmosphere. Like any good score, it highlights moments and builds suspense, but without feeling cheap. It's melancholic and disturbing in equal measure. Just listening to it while sat alone writing this review made me feel unsettled, like something was going to creep up on me, and yet I enjoyed the music separately so much that I put it on repeat.It Follows is absolutely one of the finest horror movies in recent memory. It picks atmosphere over cheap scares, it's expertly written with a mind for themes and ambiguity, it's beautiful to look at and entertaining to listen to. It doesn't pick substance over style, but keeps both to the benefit of each other. Fantastic movie, would recommend, will watch again. 9/10.",9,20,33,8 November 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Best Line in the Trailers Wasn't Even in the Movie. 2/10.
","To call this an Avengers movie feels a bit off. The Avengers are in it for sure, as are the Guardians of the Galaxy, but this is more Thanos' film. He takes centre stage, soaking up all the best parts. Even when he's not on screen, his presence permeates and threatens. His quest for the Infinity Stones has officially begun. The film opens with him already having taken the Power Stone from Xandar, and is well on his way to getting the Space Stone from Loki.As openings go, this is up there for establishing the sheer threat Thanos poses to each and every character we've grown to love over the last decade. I mean, the guy beats Hulk into a pulp without using any stones at all, and he only grows more and more powerful as the film goes on. The stakes have never been higher in an MCU movie. The threat of permanent character death is very, very real, and no-one is above it. I won't spoil who dies, but some are easy guesses, and others come out the left field. In truth there's definitely a sense of unpredictability thanks to the pure power Thanos can unleash. He quite literally crashes a moon down into a planet, turns weapons into bubbles, and by the end can even rewind time to suit his needs. And of course that fabled snap of the fingers marks the climax of the movie.But the real strength of Thanos comes from the treatment of his character. He could quite possibly be the single greatest villain in the MCU thanks to how he's developed. He's unyielding and horrifically strong even without the power of the gauntlet, but he also shows vulnerabilities, and acts out of a misplaced sense of moral philosophy. He's not just evil for evil's sake, he has clear definable goals that aren't entirely incorrect. He seeks balance and paradise, ultimately just wanting to make the universe a better place for everyone. He cares about life in all its forms and sees what he's doing as a necessary evil to save everyone.What really took me aback is how emotional the movie is (Oh boy, spoilers). While it doesn't let up in it's unrelenting fight scenes and sense of dread, it still takes the time to ponder on how it makes everyone feel. I actually really felt for Gamora and Thanos respectively, not just at poignant moments, but in general considering everything they've endured together. When Gamora appears to kill Thanos, it's not triumphant but full of grief. While she hates him to the end, he was still her father figure. Likewise when he has to sacrifice her later on, he mourns throughout the rest of the movie, because he really did love his favourite daughter. She wasn't just a tool for him; he forgave her betrayals precisely because he loved her so much. As misguided as his methods seem, he still managed to show a human element that not only made him relatable, but also made him oddly likeable - he shows a vulnerability beneath his powerful capabilities that gives him the greatest depth of any MCU villain. But above all it was Peter Parker that broke me, watching those around him fade out of existence, and then feeling the very same come over him - heightened by his enhanced senses. He's just a scared teenager facing the ultimate existential crisis, and his pleading to stay genuinely made my tear ducts fill. Dear god Tom Holland can act.And yet through all of the dread, the constant threat of death, and the sheer emotional heartbreak, Infinity War manages to keep its head above water with succinct, natural humour that manages to make you laugh out loud. Of course a lot of this is down to simple character interactions, like Rocket asking to buy Bucky's metal arm, or Star-Lord becoming envious of Thor's physique. This is the Avengers movie where unrelated franchises smash together and we're gifted with odd interaction after odd interaction, and each and every one manages to find humour without forcing it outEntertaining character interactions aren't just restricted to comedy though. The Avengers movies, as well the various team-ups between them, have been defined by how each hero comes together as a cohesive team when taking down a foe, whether it's Thor and Captain America creating a shockwave between hammer and shield, or Hawkeye shooting Ant-Man into Iron Man's suit. Infinity War is no exception, and the behemoth cast extends the options a little further. Doctor Strange creates portals for Spider-Man to jump through and stepping stones for Star-Lord, Bucky dual-wields a machine gun in one hand and Rocket in the other, Bruce Banner takes the Hulkbuster out for a spin when Hulk refuses to show up, Groot creates a weapon handle for Thor out of his own arm, as well as quite a few others.On that note, the action is simply top-notch. It's unrelenting from the Thanos vs Hulk fight in the opening all the way up to the infamous snap. There always seems to be an action scene going on somewhere, and the character combos I mentioned above are only scratching the surface of the amount of cool stuff that goes on. Thanos himself is a powerhouse, especially once he gets the reality stone, and the way he uses them all is hugely creative. There's one particular fight between Thanos and Doctor Strange that is the epitome of mind-bending as they hurl spells at one another (in Doctor Strange's case, literally). It's all so fluid and stylish. Not only that but the epic scale and unrelenting nature of the action scenes make it feel like an actual war rather than just a small skirmish at an airport, and how it managed to fit it all in and make space for the more emotional beats without ruining the pace blows my mind. Top notch editing for sure.The CGI is pretty incredible for the most part as well. The Black Order are brought to life by their visual effects, but it's Thanos who really shines, showing each and every hair on the back of his neck and side of his face. The sheer attention to detail is staggering. Beyond that the CGI doesn't stifle Josh Brolin's ability to act at all, and Thanos' personality is palpable through his facial expressions alone. On the other side of the coin though, there's some truly terrible visual effects work when it comes to Hulkbuster and Warmachine. There's a shot very late on where Banner and Rhodey appear in their armour without helmets on, but the blending is so bad that their heads just look stuck on. This corner-cutting for some of the visual effects, especially considering how utterly fantastic other effects are, is pretty much my only criticism of the whole movie.But I think I've rambled on enough. Infinity War was everything I wanted it to be and more. It surpasses every other effort in the MCU (a claim I really hope I don't go back on as the film sinks in over time and multiple rewatches). Thanos is the greatest villain there is, showing heartbreaking vulnerabilities as well as being a complete and utter badass (although his line about putting a smile on his face was irksomely absent), the humour is genuinely very funny, but also natural and comes about organically through simple character interactions, the stakes are real as characters do die, permanently, and the status quo is forever changed by the movie's close. I don't feel it's that bold a claim to say Infinity War is the MCU's Empire Strikes Back in more ways than one. I almost want to give it a perfect 10/10 straight out of the gate, but for now I'll settle for a still extremely respectable 9/10. My heart was genuinely racing long after the credits rolled, and that can only be a good sign.",9,1,4,26 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's Feet-iest Movie Yet
","Tarantino's ninth film has been hotly anticipated, and with good reason. Just to be alive at a time where Tarantino makes a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt sharing the leads is fantastic. It's the assembly of the best of Hollywood this side of the millenium. Except I left the cinema not feeling like it lived up to that at all. I'm somewhat disappointed, and without having seen Death Proof (still, I know), this is Tarantino's worst movie.This is where I usually go into the general plot to provide context, but it's precisely this point that left me disappointed. There's no story. Not really. Rick Dalton is a has-been actor coming to the realisation that he's not as treasured in Hollywood as he used to be. Cliff Booth is his stunt double and now personal handyman, essentially blacklisted from Hollywood after allegedly killing his wife. These two fictional characters are thrust into late-60s Hollywood, and intimately related to Sharon Tate and the Manson Family. And that's the story. That's the whole thing. There aren't plot points, just characters going through the motions.Rick and Cliff meander around LA for the first two-thirds of the movie. Rick gives a villainous performance on the set of a Western TV show while grappling with his own insecurities, while Cliff fixes an antenna, daydreams a little, and offers a lift to a member of the Manson Family back to Spahn Ranch. Meanwhile Sharon Tate goes to a small cinema to watch one of her own movies and enjoys the audience's reactions. The actual plot doesn't kick in until a 6-month time jump with the time filled in by narration, essentially cutting out some of the more interesting build-up of the film, and jumping back into the infamous Manson Family Murders, or at least Tarantino's own alternate history, fairytale retelling.Even now I'm struggling to reconcile what the point of the first two-thirds even was. The only part that felt relevant was Cliff's escapades at Spahn Ranch as they tied directly into the film's climax. The rest was just Hollywood being self-congratulatory and intimately establishing Rick's character. Sharon Tate's inclusion was utterly pointless and could've been cut out entirely without creating any holes. I can't say I was ever bored as Tarantino is certainly capable of making the mundane seem interesting, but it certainly dragged and felt overly meandering. It's hard to believe he spent four or five years writing this and such a large portion is badly-paced and pointless. I understand this is a 'memory piece' for him, portraying the Hollywood he grew up with when he was younger, but I didn't grow up with it. I don't hold any kind of nostalgia for this time period. I want to say that's why this movie didn't do it for me, but my dad felt the same, despite it showing his childhood era of TV and movies as well.There are moments during the movie's trunk that are worth watching though. While Rick Dalton's story on the set of a Western TV show is ultimately pointless and goes on for way too long, seeing him struggle with his insecurities offered the film's biggest emotional backbone. His conversation with his young co-star about the book he's reading and how it reminds him of himself, his breakdown in his trailer after a scene gone badly, and his reaction to praise received after a scene gone right are definite highlights of his character, and DiCaprio pulls them off fantastically. Another best actor win? Maybe not, but a really good show of talent nonetheless. I can't imagine much harder than being actor playing an actor playing a role, but he doesn't falter one bit.That said, Cliff Booth is arguably the real main character of the movie. He comes off as a genuinely nice guy with a big heart, and while Rick pays him to be his handyman and driver, there is a real friendship between them nonetheless, completely devoid of male friendship clichÃ©s. Cliff is also a complete and utter badass, besting Bruce Lee in a spar, potentially being a wife-murderer, and taking on an entire cult on their own ground without showing an ounce of fear. Throughout the movie's runtime he's established as the kind of guy you want on your side, because he'll treat you well, and not a guy you want to oppose, because he will take you down. Of course he's instrumental in the film's alternate history climax and shows why this characterisation as a badass was not only downright cool, but also necessary. Out of all the subplots in the first two-thirds, Cliff's are the hardest to cut. And Brad Pitt owns it. He exudes cool and charm, is evidently quite capable in a fight, and hits all the comedic beats perfectly as well (his experience with acid was the source of much laughter).As much as I love Margot Robbie, Sharon Tate's presence was unfortunately useless. Margaret Qualley was also included literally just to be underage (character-wise at least) eye-candy, with a flirty presence, and near-exploitative camera angles of her various body parts. Yes, including feet. Once Upon a Time... is Tarantino's most feet-iest movie to date. There's bare feet everywhere. Robbie gets her bare feet out in the movie theater, Dakota Fanning walks around in bare feet, and Qualley's bare feet literally take up half the screen in her scenes with Brad Pitt. Almost every other famous face is a cameo, from Bruce Dern holed up in bed, Michael Madsen included just to prove Tarantino doesn't always kill his characters off (and his car gets more screentime than he does), Al Pacino as Rick's agent at the beginning, Austin Butler as the despicable Tex, Dakota Fanning as the 'Mama' of the Manson Family, Emile Hirsch as the pointless-Tate's best friend Jay Sebring, Damien Lewis spreading gossip at the playboy mansion as Steve McQueen, Timothy Olyphant as the star of the Western TV show being filmed alongside Scoot McNairy and Clifton Collins Jr., Kurt Russell as a stunt coordinator and Zoe Bell as his wife, as well as Lena Dunham, Maya Hawke, and Harley Quinn Smith as members of the Manson Family (Rumer Willis, another daughter of the famous, is also in there as Joanna Pettet).As a Tarantino fan, I'm unfortunately siding with the opinion that you could probably get away with missing this entirely. There's some good stuff in here, but too much of it is there just for its own sake. The film feels unfocussed and overlong, like it could do with a few more drafts in editing. The only scenes really worth watching are those involving Cliff and then everything after the 6-month jump. I give Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood an enjoyable but underwhelming 7/10. Maybe I'll reconsider with a rewatch, but that's where I sit initially.",7,0,0,20 August 2019
Get Out," How had No-one Thought of this Before?
","When I first saw the trailer for this, my first reaction was 'how had no-one thought of this before?' A black guy meets his white girlfriend's family for the first time and finds himself wrapped up in a Stepford Wives situation where every other black person he meets acts really dodgy and he suspects something untoward. That premise was enough to get my bum in the seat, but it's near 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes sealed the deal.As explained, Chris is a black man; a detail crucial to the underlying unease of the whole movie. His girlfriend Rose is white, and they're off to meet her rich, white parents in the middle of nowhere who have no idea of his skin colour. On the way Chris suffers microaggressions from a policeman (to which Rose acts his protective white knight), and her parents treat him nicely enough, but overcompensate a bit so as not to appear racist. 'I would've voted for Obama for a third term' is an oft repeated phrase in the movie. There's also a social gathering of family friends inbound, again, all of which are white and middle-aged at the youngest, and none of which are obviously racist in the typical way. They're very accepting and nice of him, and yet the questions they ask highlighting his skin colour makes him feel increasingly uncomfortable.The whole race debate aside, Get Out is undoubtedly a solid piece of filmmaking. It's story is quite simplistic in it's execution. We meet Chris and Rose, they travel to her parents house, they spend a day there hanging out, Chris starts to feel uneasy, the party guests arrive and things get more uneasy to the point where Chris wants to leave, and then there's a small series of twists and revelations that lead directly into Get Out's third act. By the time the credits roll, you realise how conventional Get Out's story really is. Race aside, it follows many of the same beats as a lot of thrillers, and doesn't hold too many surprises, but it executes it all so well it doesn't even matter.As they say, the devil is in the details, and Peele has obviously put a lot of work into the little details. There's almost no filler in this movie at all, and every little thing is important to one degree or another. For instance it's no coincidence that Chris uses cotton wool to avoid succumbing to what basically amounts to modern-day slavery. There's other odd little moments and details that I missed the significance off initially until I looked back on them and figured it all out backwards. There's just a lot to keep an eye (and ear) on. Tied into this is some really good cinematography that's used to great effect. There honestly was a moment where I felt so overcome with tension that I was tempted to walk out because I couldn't take it any more. I didn't, obviously, but I felt like I needed to leave thanks in most part to how everything was framed and each scene composed made me feel uncomfortable.Get Out is also actually quite amusing at times, which is no surprise coming from one half of Key & Peele. The scenes with all the guests at the party are obviously satirical genius, turning what could be completely ordinary conversation into something both simultaneously hilarious and uncomfortably awkward. But the other big source of laughs comes in the form of airport security Rod; Chris' best friend, who basically amounts to the movie's comic relief. Every scene he appeared in resulted in some fantastic audience participation in my screening. Crucially though, Get Out is never a comedy. It's humorous moments are used to heighten the uneasiness of the whole situation more than anything, offering brief respites from the uncomfortableness.Acting is top-notch from everyone as well. Daniel Kaluuya is a revelation as Chris. He holds a charisma that makes him incredibly likable and easy to empathise with, and his ability to show a strength and put up with the way he's treated, while also showing how uncomfortable he is with it is the backbone of the entire movie. Allison Williams is also really convincing as the black sheep of her family (excuse the phrase) as the most genuinely accepting member of her family, while Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford definitely seemed to have a lot of fun as the parents. They're charming and liberal enough that they're really easy to like, and yet suspicion is never fully lifted from them. Their performances are the perfect slow burns. Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel, and Lakeith Stanford are each on a level-playing field with their oddly- behaving personas, while as I've already briefly mentioned Lil Rel Howery is effortlessly the comic relief of the movie providing genuine moments of humour.In all Get Out is a solid film in almost every regard. It's full of tiny little details that enhance the experience exponentially, and creates an atmosphere that's incomparably hard to stomach. It genuinely made me a little anxious watching it at times. While it's not jumpscares every ten minutes, and wouldn't fill a swimming pool with blood, it's undeniably a horror movie in the most cerebral sense, and for that it gets endless praise. It's intrinsic racial aspect is both it's saving grace and it's downfall though, proving a genius concept worth exploring, but maybe wasn't quite executed as good as it could have been. I give Get Out a solid 8/10 and would definitely recommend it.",8,12,21,22 March 2017
2012," Swap Brain for Eyes
","No seriously. Leave your brain at the door. No, further...further...further. Okay scrap that, don't even bring it with you. Leave it at home. Cool. Now you'll enjoy this movie.Roland Emmerich (let's remind ourselves that he made Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow here, just so we know what to expect) has stuck to what he knows, but blown it up (sometimes literally) to a bigger and more ambitious scale. The characters are paper-thin, the plot is unoriginal and linear, acting is average at best (even from Chiwetel Ejiofor, unfortunately), background is pretty much nil...Oh, did I say those were bad things? No, you've left your brain at home, remember?2012 is a disaster movie, and probably the most epic of it's type topping only other Emmerich disaster movies. There is CGI. Lots of it. In fact, half the film is made up of CGI. Bad thing? No, most certainly not! (I always wonder why CGI in films is frowned upon...) The effects are breathtaking and truly epic. I mean, who wouldn't want to see the White House get mown down by an aircraft carrier propelled by a 2,000ft tidal wave?! Why does this all happen, you may ask. The answer is simple; it's not important. Of course, there's some vague explanation to some of the events that makes some sort of sense, but really, it's not important. Remember, you left your brain at home. Apart from some paper-thin, but necessary background to ease you into the action, this film is pretty much non-stop eye-candy. Watching Yellowstone National Park erupt was a particular highlight. Also, keep in mind this is Hollywood. This is not real, so why should everything be realistic? Sure, it's a bit suspect that they happen to land in place X after suffering issues with problem Y only for group Z to come by a few seconds later, but again, this doesn't matter if you don't have a brain. So howcome he can fly a massive freighter plane? Doesn't matter, he just can. Also beware of time-wasting in an urgent crisis just to be sentimental and fairly obvious morals and messages, but they're endearing and make for a bit of happiness and joy in an otherwise bleak situation.To those who have seen the movie (no spoilers follow), would you really have enjoyed it more if it was more realistic? I'd presume not. A realistic apocalypse would be a horrible thing to watch on a massive screen for 2 and a half hours. The main characters would die in the first few minutes and it would be impossibly depressing, hopeless and serious. Which brings me nicely onto my next point. This film is not serious, in no way, shape, or form. It's supposed to be a bit of light-hearted fun! And you know what? It succeeds. No it really does!Me and my fiancée like our serious, deep, intelligent films, but we also like our mindless fun and eye-candy. We can leave our brains at home before watching a bit of entertainment. And you know what? We stuck this into our DVD player and we had fun. We were thoroughly entertained. You know what else? We regretted not paying to see it at the cinema when it first came out.Rating with a brain - 3 or 4/10, Rating without brain - 8/10Just have fun, yeah?",8,1,2,21 May 2010
A Quiet Place," The Plotholes Don't Matter
","A Quiet Place follows a single family as they navigate a new world of silence. The daughter of the family being deaf gives them an advantage in this landscape as they're all still able to communicate with one another. But this movie isn't about the alien invasion, it's about them, the family. It's about being a family. The mother, Evelyn is heavily pregnant, which as you can imagine poses its own problems. You can't keep babies quiet, and good luck not screaming through labour. Thankfully they're a smart family with a lot of smart solutions to problems. For instance they have a soundproofed basement for the baby to reside in, and a further soundproofed box with breathing apparatus to put the child in should things get hairy. They use a system of lights as a warning, use paths of sand to walk around barefoot, and keep connections with other local survivors by regular check-ins by firelight.What I found really refreshing and unexpected about this movie was how incredibly light it was on plot. Where did the creatures come from? Doesn't matter. How have the family managed to keep corn crops without making a sound? Doesn't matter. Why is the mother pregnant again? Doesn't really matter, but you'll understand if you pay attention and don't lack brain cells. Instead the film is super simple, basing almost the entirety of the action on the family farm, and almost all the tension derives from things going from bad to worse one thing at a time, and setting it all up well in advance. You see the nail pointing up through the step and you know what's going to happen. Rather than this predictability being a problem, it instead suspends you as you wait for the inevitable, and fully understand the consequences of when it does finally happen. And then it snowballs. One thing after another, and even when you think they're safe, something else happens putting your heart back in your throat.The acting is great all round, especially from the kid actors. John Krasinski achieves a perfect balance between acting and directing, giving a very genuine performance as a father stuck in a hard position, trying his best to protect his family. Near the end his performance may even give you chills. Emily Blunt is fantastic as the mother, going through the emotions effortlessly as if this was all really happening. She's a supportive mother, a loving wife, and when she endures pain, she endures it harder than anyone else. Naturally the chemistry Blunt and Krasinski share is palpable, which is not surprising considering their real life relationship. But the kids really impress. Noah Jupe is maybe the most expected of the child actors as Marcus, who still clings to being a child as much as he can despite knowing he needs to mature up and help pull his weight. He's ultimately a child wracked by fear. Millicent Simmonds absolutely nails it though as the defiant Regan, determined to not be defined or looked down upon by her disability. Her real life deafness really adds authenticity to the emotions she displays, having grown up with other ways to communicate and emote. Big props to everyone else for learning sign language though, the movie wouldn't have been the same without it.And yet the biggest star of the movie was the sound department, or more rather their restraint. The film's biggest strength is its use of silence. Every little sound becomes amplified and carries so much more weight than usual, thanks in large part to so much of the movie being in absolute silence. The score by Marco Beltrami never betrays this approach, only peeking in when absolutely necessary to add emotional depth and enhance the suspense. Krasinski otherwise lets the silence speak for itself. There's nothing more nerve-wracking than a rattle, bang, or cry when it literally means life or death.A Quiet Place is a tight ninety minutes of nail-biting tension. It never outstays its welcome, touches on just enough world-building to entice without detracting from the core family and their one bad night in the country, and displays some of the most restrained and atmospheric directing from Krasinski. There are plot holes here, but they never detract from the film's underlying foundations, and most can be explained away with a little bit of thought, or just simply don't matter to the story it wants to tell. Why didn't she remove the nail? I don't know, when did she even have a chance to remove the nail? I give A Quiet Place a very high 8/10, and honestly I could easily give it more.",8,1,1,17 March 2020
Kick-Ass," Cannot Praise This Enough.
","Literally just got back from Kick-Ass Go watch this movie now. I cannot praise it enough.Casting was perfect. Music was perfect. Characters were perfect. Direction was perfect. Visuals were perfect. Action scenes were perfect. Comedy was perfect. Story was perfect. Kick-Ass is perfect.In fact. Kick-Ass is so good, I cannot find fault. Nicholas Cage's short and sharp speech as if there was a full stop after every word while he was dressed up as Big Daddy was pretty annoying....but at the same time...perfect.The comic moments were genuinely laugh out loud funny, and there were plenty of them. The heart-warming moments were so heart-warming you couldn't help but smile. The emotional scenes were so moving you could almost cry. The action scenes were so spot on. Everything from the action itself to the music and camera angles couldn't have been better. Genuinely thrilling and exciting, and the bad-assery was literally bad-ass and...dare I say it...they Kicked-Ass!! Actually amazing. Seriously. I cannot praise this film enough. Just go and see it.10/10 And no, the rating isn't the result of it being the shiny new film. It earned every single star.",9,4,22,26 March 2010
X-Men: Apocalypse," The Third Movie's Not Always the Worst
","While Days of Future Past played on our nostalgia by giving us the original cast back, Apocalypse holds the trend by introducing younger versions of them. Jean Grey, Scott Summers, Ororo Munroe, and Kurt Wagner are back, but as teenagers. The core of Xavier, Erik, Raven, and Hank return once again to keep the 'preboot' foundation alive, while Quicksilver, Moira, Alex Summers, and the younger Stryker return as well. And yes, Wolverine too, although in a slightly extended use to his nod in First Class.Unfortunately, Apocalypse doesn't spend a particularly great amount of time introducing brand new mutants and characters. I was really excited to finally see a live-action Jubilee given her long overdue spotlight. I remember her fondly from the 90s cartoon. Unfortunately she's little more than a cameo used to make sure you know you're in the 80s. There's also Psylocke and yet another Angel (I've lost count now), but neither of them are played as anything more than bodyguards, which is pretty much all the Four Horsemen are. Furthermore it kind of quashed the surprise and tension when you pinpointed exactly which horsemen would betray Apocalypse before the movie even started. The lack of development also unfortunately extends to the hyped return of Moira from First Class. Once we hit the third act, I found myself wondering why on earth she was reintroduced in the first place, as she holds absolutely no use beyond a small comical exchange with Xavier early on. For some reason that gives her a right to tag along, where she just sits there and does literally nothing the whole time.Apocalypse himself was a bit of a two-sided apple. On one side, there's no denying Oscar Isaac's ability to play the villain really well. He offers probably the strongest Super-Villain this year (which isn't saying a lot compared to the super-lacklustre Ajax, Lex Luthor, and Zemo we've had so far). Isaac has a way of bringing a godly gravitas and sense of real threat to Apocalypse which was impressive. It was sorely needed because physically, Apocalypse is a bit of a letdown. As talented as Isaac is, he just isn't tall or bulky enough. It felt a little off when Magneto looks him in the eye and they're as tall as each other. The somewhat tacky make-up job doesn't do him any favours either.The rest of the cast do admirably as well though. James McAvoy's Xavier sounds a little lazy and not bothered during the film's opening monologue, but he re-engages afterwards and brings back that young Xavier that could almost be a young Patrick Stewart. Jennifer Lawrence is on par with her previous outings, neither showing improvement nor any sign of slacking. Most the praise belongs to the new cast members. Tye Sheridan does a pretty good job of the young Scott Summers who's just coming to terms with his uncontrollable lazer eyes, and Sophie Turner is a perfect fit for Jean Grey (although her American accent sounds a bit off at times). Kodi Smit- McPhee is completely unrecognisable as Nightcrawler though. Hats off to him. Obviously though, and for the third time in a row, Michael Fassbender is the star of the show. Magneto is again offered arguably more character development than any other character, and Fassbender puts it to good use. Time and again he is the highlight of the movie.Apocalypse is probably one of the most action-orientated X-Men movies around, certainly the most action packed that Bryan Singer has personally directed. He took on quite a large bite for Apocalypse though, requiring an epic and bombastic approach to the fight scenes. Apocalypse is pretty much a god after all. I can't say it's fully successful, as there weren't any particularly memorable clashes (unlike Nightcrawler's attack on the White House in X2, for example), but what we get certainly does the job, without any of this silly zoom-in and shake the camera crap blockbusters are getting increasingly riddled with. It was also really cool to see the unstoppable Apocalypse tackled more than just physically, as Xavier takes him on mentally while everyone else is hitting him with all they've got. It finally takes a hint of what's to come to finally beat him, but I won't spoil it.The effects are hit and miss just like Apocalypse himself. I've mentioned his make-up and costume, so I won't talk about that again, but there is a lot of CGI here. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. Smaller, more intimate uses are great, like people being swallowed up by walls or Apocalypse's growth in the mental battle against Xavier, but the grander moments are let down by a lack of clarity. For example, there's a moment just before the third act where Apocalypse disintegrates a city in order to build a giant pyramid. The screen just gets filled with indiscernible dust for a few minutes as you try to figure out exactly what's going on. It's unfortunately not an isolated incident.Apocalypse was a worthy and enjoyable addition to the X-Men franchise. I look forward to seeing the younger versions of these classic characters return once again, but beyond Wolverine 3 and the Deadpool movies, I feel pretty happy to leave the X-Men movies here, if it comes to that. It wasn't the best the franchise has to offer, but it was far from the worst as well. Thankfully it's self-fulfilling, tongue-in-cheek prophecy of 'the third movie is always the worst' didn't come to pass. I give Apocalypse a respectable 7/10",7,4,10,18 May 2016
Coco," A Beautiful Movie that Transcends Age and Nationality
","Miguel comes from a long line of music-haters after his great-great-grandfather left his young family to pursue a life in music. He was cut out entirely, and his actions as a deadbeat dad reverberated through the generations. For the last five generations, Miguel's family have been shoemakers, and abhorred any source of music. Unfortunately for Miguel he's garnered a taste for the musical, learning guitar by watching old movies of a famous singer from the town. As Dia De Muertos nears, he seeks a way to pursue his love of music, and instead finds himself transported to the land of the dead, surrounded by deceased ancestors, and starts a race against time to find his way back to the land of the living while also keeping his love of music.Pixar have never shied away from darker, more emotional themes in their movies, arguably reaching an apex with Inside Out's exploration of depression. Coco is potentially another emotional apex for the company, looking at death and family together, marrying it up with memory and Alzheimer's, and the power music holds over generations. Coco, unlike any other Pixar movie, also isn't afraid of showing death either. One of the opening scenes shows a man getting crushed by a bell, while another one later shows a man falling to the ground after being poisoned. And to turn away from these moments as Pixar usually would would've felt disingenuous in a movie all about death.Linked to this is the legacy we all leave of memory. If we can be remembered for generations, we gain immortality, but to be forgotten is to suffer a final death. This is a fate Hector starts to suffer through the movie, as his family has forgotten him, and his last living relative who knew him when he was alive also starts to forget and pass away themselves. This offers a double whammy of emotion because even though Hector is already dead, he needs to avoid being forgotten so he can stay in the land of the dead with his loved ones. And music is the solution. Music is passed down through time, is never forgotten, and means something to everyone. It's been proven to rekindle memory in Alzheimer's patients, and Coco takes this and builds an entire story around it.Coco also manages to stay true to its cultural portrayals. Much like Moana before it, Coco is as much a celebration of a culture as it is a moving, emotional story of death and memory. Not being Mexican myself no doubt much of its significance went completely over my head, but it remains respectful of Mexican traditions throughout, and even features cameos from various Mexican celebrities. Dia De Muertos means a lot to Mexicans, and so there's no better way to celebrate them and their culture than with a story revolving around that tradition.Unsurprisingly Coco is a visual treat, surpassing that of even other Pixar movies. There's so much detail in every shot, and even when deliberately cartoony, each and every character enjoys the painstaking detail that brings them to life. Mama Coco herself is probably the best example of this, appearing both as a caricature of an old woman, while also being one of the most anatomically accurate portrayals of an old woman in an animated feature. The wrinkles, the way the skin sags, the way she holds herself in her wheelchair, the blemishes in her skin, her eyes, her nose, her mouth, her hair. She just looks like anyone's grandmother. The settings and backdrops similarly enjoy an incredible amount of detail paid to them. The Land of the Dead in particular is so vibrant and full of life (heh) with lights and colours everywhere. It's depicted as a city of towers, where the new builds upon the old, all the way back to the stepped temples of the Mayans and Aztecs and up through to modern cityscapes and apartment blocks.The music is also pretty good as well, which is fortunate considering how much of the movie revolves around it as a key concept. The score by Michael Giacchino is interlaced with Mexican instrumentation like mariachi trumpets and nylon-strung acoustic guitars, but most of the emotional weight of the film comes through its original songs by Germaine Franco, and Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. The latter of which wrote the movie's most pivotal song 'Remember Me' which is great and so versatile it's sung and arranged at least three different ways throughout the movie. In many ways the original songs make Coco feel more like usual Disney affair, and while it might not be as musically strong as Moana, it still sits at home alongside other Disney musicals.Coco is a beautiful movie for all ages and all nationalities. It speaks to everyone the world over about death and family, and remembering the ones we've lost, making it a fitting movie to watch now, around Remembrance Day. It may touch on similar plot points as other Disney/Pixar movies, but when the formula works there's no need to disrupt it when a movie like Coco comes around injecting fresh voices and concepts into it. I give it a tentative 8/10, but in time I could absolutely see it getting bumped up to a 9. Bring tissues.",8,1,2,10 November 2019
1917," An Experience and a Technical Achievement, But Little Else.
","The story follows Corporals Blake and Schofield as they're given a mission to cross into enemy territory to deliver a message to a Colonel about to step into a German trap. The film follows along roughly in real time as the two men traverse trenches, no man's land, and abandoned towns, taking every opportunity to show us the horrors of war along the way. They meet a variety of side characters who help them move from one setpiece to the next, all while the camera follows keenly, never cutting away from what they see or how they react. As far as story goes, there honestly isn't all that much to it. It's a straight-forward story of a journey from point A to point B. No frills, no mind-bending twists, no flashbacks. The story is secondary to the experience the film wants to immerse you in.The most obvious way the film immerses you in the theatre of war is with its relentlessly promoted use of long shots and hidden cuts. If I was a pernickety critic, I'd point out it's actually two composite long-shots rather than just a single one thanks to a cut to black roughly in the middle, which makes the gimmick feel almost superfluous. If you're going to make a film with the goal of it being a single long-shot, don't cut it to black in the middle. Of course the reason they do this is so they don't have to tackle with the problem of dusk. Dusk is already a difficult time of day to film in, but to somehow capture the transition from day to night in a composite long-shot would be almost impossible. It also helps narratively by placing the climax of the movie in the early morning without the film being twelve hours long.So I can see why they made that decision, but ultimately I feel like if it was really that necessary, the film should have eschewed the gimmick and been filmed and edited more traditionally, using the concept of long-shots more sparingly to make certain scenes stand out above others. When you make the whole movie a long-shot, you're making the visceral trek across no man's land just as significant as an uneventful trek through the woods. The walk through the woods didn't particularly gain anything from being a long-shot, nor did any sequence of events at the farmhouse or in the truck, and bringing them up to the level of the no man's land scene, the numerous trench scenes, and the Écoust sequence kind of cheapened the experience for me.All that said, on a purely technical basis, the use of long-shot was phenomenal. This was easily some of the best composite editing I've ever seen. In fact knowing it was going to be a long-shot kind of ruined the experience for me because I spent the whole time trying to spot the cuts. There are some obvious ones like complete blackout when they move from an exterior to an interior, and of course clever use of obstacles in the foreground like walls and trees, but there are many more that I couldn't spot. For instance there's one during the plane crash and I couldn't spot it even though I've seen a video pointing it out. God knows how many more of those kind of cuts I missed. There's a couple more as well that are a bit obvious when Schofield jumps down into something (once into a crater and second into a river). You can tell there's a cut because his jump is CGI'd in in order to match the two shots together. Regardless the camera moves so smoothly from one moment to another that most the time it's impossible to tell. Watch out for the river scene. There must have been cuts there, complicated by the turbulent waters, but I couldn't see any. The illusion of moving from one scene to another is maybe only spoiled by so many landmarks being seemingly so close together. Thanks to all the difficulties they encounter along the way to slow them down, the actual walk unimpeded would've taken less than two hours.The use of lighting is also remarkable, especially in the Écoust sequence with the blazing fire creating Deakins' favoured single-source of light, but then complicating matters with a number of flares that go up and cast ever-shifting shadows on the walls of the ruins. They had to map this sequence out with a model of the entire town and a moving torch in order to track the shadows movements before filming, and that alone is worth kudos. Other than that though, 1917 is a fairly subtle film for Deakins. It's never particularly pretty, and the long-shot gimmick prevents the opportunity for fixed camera compositions, but that's not what this movie is about. Deakins manages to craft a visual identity fitting for this movie that services every need while showing off in more subtler ways.Acting was pretty good across the board. George MacKay manages to hold the emotional weight of the film on his shoulders from beginning to end (or tree-slump to tree-slump) as Corporal Schofield, playing a young man already disillusioned with war. He's already earned a medal, and given it away, longing only to get back to his family. He comes across as cold and distant for much of the film, because he's a soldier with an important mission that must be done, no matter how unhappy he feels about it. Dean-Charles Chapman is also really good as Corporal Blake, offering the perfect counter to Schofield's pessimism. He's driven, enthusiastic, kind-hearted, and wouldn't mind a little bit of glory on the side. While he doesn't ignore the horrors of war, he certainly perceives them differently to Schofield, assuring him that while the cherry blossom trees may have been cut down, they'll only grow back in larger numbers.The various cameos of side-characters are all great as well. Colin Firth is perfectly cast as the General, no nonsense and straight to the point. Mark Strong's Captain is a warmer fellow, encountering the boys at their lowest and giving them a leg up and a word of warning. Andrew Scott almost steals the show as a Lieutenant on the frontlines with a blasé and matter-of-fact attitude towards what's going on around him. Benedict Cumberbatch is a slice of antagonism in the Colonel, but manages to escape any cliché in his small screen time, delivering one of the most brutal lines in the whole film. And finally Richard Madden as the older Blake brother gives an emotional turn, although I did find it somewhat hilarious that this film described Robb Stark as an older lookalike of Tommen Baratheon.1917 almost lives up to everything it promised (it's two long-shots, not one). War is not pretty. It's horrible and intense, and a simple trek through five miles of fields is fraught with danger around every corner, from the places you'd least expect. The barren wasteland is not as barren as it would appear, still hiding civilians and enemy stragglers (who hit like stormtroopers, I'll add). 1917 is an experience more than anything, and it's an experience I would gladly have again. I give it a solid 8/10.",8,0,1,10 January 2020
Pi," A Flawed Look at the Madness of Obsession
","I'm a big Darren Aronofsky fan. I have been ever since I saw The Fountain fourteen years ago, and it completely revolutionised what I thought movies were capable of. I often credit it with making me the movie buff I am today. Since then I have watched every single Aronofsky movie, and largely loved all of them. Except Pi, his feature-length debut (and his early shorts). This was mainly because I just couldn't find it anywhere, and when I could it was priced so far out of what was reasonable. I became resigned to the fact it was probably going to be a movie I'll never see. Thank you Amazon for having it available on Prime video.Pi follows Max, a man obsessed with predicting the stock market. He's convinced there's mathematical patterns in everything. During one particular prediction session, his homemade supercomputer crashes after spitting out a 216-digit number. He thinks nothing of it, throws the print-out away, and gets to fixing his computer ready for next time. But it's not long before other people start mentioning a mysterious 216-digit number that could solve the mystery to everything. His mentor mentions the same thing occurred with his computer, and theorised that it found a brief moment of self-awareness before sputtering out. A guy in a coffee shop shows Max a secret code in the Torah, and posits that the key to God is a 216-digit in the religious texts. All the while there's a mysterious Wall Street woman who keeps hounding him to crack it and give them what they need to make a lot of money off the stock market.But there's a catch. Max is not mentally well. He suffers cluster headaches and requires medication to keep them under control. As the movie progresses his mental state deteriorates and he starts hallucinating. It starts to question his reliability as a narrator. Is he a mathematical genius, or just a paranoid schizophrenic with delusion of grandeur? Is the Wall Street woman real or just an aggressive delusion of being followed? Is there really a 216-digit code in the Torah, or is Max just finding patterns and coincidences where there aren't any? Pi evolves into a movie as much about mental illness as it does about unlocking the secrets to the universe by a mathematical pattern.As an Aronofsky aficionado, possibly my favourite thing about watching this movie was seeing where his director tropes and trademarks all began. There's an element of Pi in all his movies, from the fascination with biblical topics (Noah, mother!), to a descent into madness and a depressing ending (Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan), to a search for something beyond human comprehension (The Fountain), to following a single character intimately as they break down (The Wrestler). It's all here. Even filming techniques like relentless close-ups, quick cuts, and a distraction to inanimate objects. Pi has it all. It feels as much like an Aronofsky movie as any other, almost like there was no filmmaking voice for him to find; it's all been there since the beginning.But. But Pi probably ranks as my least favourite Aronofsky movie, for one very simple reason. It's an ugly movie to look at. I understand the reasoning behind it, for sure, but for me it got in the way of the viewing experience rather than enhanced it. Pi is filmed entirely in black and white, with the contrast dialed all the way up. There's barely any grey, there's either light or shadow. It works as an insight into Max's binary state of mind. The world to him is black and white. There's a pattern to it and it can be cracked. But from a moviemaking perspective, it blots out the details. It makes it hard to discern exactly what you're looking at, and causes the film's more frenetic moments to just turn into an indecipherable blur. It wouldn't have been so bad if there wasn't a thick layer of grain over the top of everything, muddying an already lacklustre visual quality. Again it's meant to bring us into Max's world, and be reminiscent of old science experiment footage, but ultimately it just made it harder to watch, in a literal sense. As a counterpoint, Beyond the Black Rainbow sought out the same visual techniques in it's psychedelic sections, but succeeded at it because it didn't get in the way of what was being shown. It remained grainy enough to feel old and creepy, but crisp enough that you could see what was happening, and its use of high-contrast black and white was used to create abstract shapes rather than muddy the details of something we're meant to recognise.Another slight niggle with Pi was the acting quality. For what was ultimately an amateur film, I can't slate it too hard, but the acting performances often come off as first year acting school performances. Sean Gullette shows an apt awkwardness as Max, but often it comes out in the wrong way, delivering lines awkwardly as if he's forgotten them, or is unintentionally unsure what to do with his body. Pamela Hart as the Wall Street woman just feels incredibly off and unnatural, and Samia Shoaib as Max's neighbour looks like she was plucked out of acting school and was trying too hard to make an impression. Mark Margolis and Ben Shenkman are pretty good as the mentor and Jewish guy respectively, so it's no surprise to see them still working today, but Margolis was already an established actor going into this anyway.I am glad I watched Pi, but only to see where it all started for Aronofsky. I enjoyed the story that was being told, and while it's a story that has been done a number of times, Pi found an interesting way to tie it all together and really delve into the insanity this kind of obsession can cause (or the insanity that causes this kind of obsession). The soundtrack is also great, fast-paced and rhythmic mirroring not only Max's frantic state, but also his search for patterns and repetition in everything. Using tracks from the likes of Orbital, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, and composer Clint Mansell, it makes a surprisingly cohesive soundtrack to listen to on its own terms as well. The acting was awkward but I can forgive that considering the budget and it being a first time, self-financed indie project. But what ultimately let it down for me was the ugly visual aesthetic that often made it too hard to actually discern what was going on. It worked thematically, but just didn't work for me. I give Pi a 7/10; solid, but let down by some superfluous issues.",7,0,0,25 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi Subverts Any and All Expectations
","The Last Jedi has the least amount of time elapsed since the previous instalment (you could make a case for Rogue One into A New Hope, but I'm not really sure that counts). The resistance, after their victory against Starkiller base, are now fleeing their own base as The First Order arrive to bombard it. We also pick up on Ahch'to immediately, with Rey handing the lightsaber over to Luke. The story that follows, in broad strokes, is pretty much just the Resistence running away from the First Order as they keep hot on their heels. Meanwhile Rey learns about herself, Luke, the Jedi, and digs deeper into Kylo Ren's psyche on the hidden planet.The biggest thing to keep in mind with The Last Jedi is it's aim, one of subversion. It subverts every expectation and Star Wars trope there is. This has rubbed many people up the wrong way, but for me it has rivitalised the franchise after the New Hope copy of Force Awakens. Where Force Awakens attempted to feel familiar and as a result mimic a lot of elements we've already seen in the saga a number of times before, Last Jedi throws them out the window and forges its own path. In this regard it's a very self-aware movie. Rian Johnson knows exactly what he was doing with it, and the hype surrounding the script - that he had written some crazy, new stuff for the franchise - does not go unfounded.One of the biggest examples of this is the role of Poe and Finn. As they reach desperation and hopelessness, they go against orders to hatch their own against-the-odds plan. They seek the heroic path we've seen a number of times in these kinds of movies. But against all expectations they fail. They fail hard. It does not result in a big triumphant moment where the good guys win against all hope and the bad guys are left scratching their heads. I've seen criticism that it makes Finn's sub-plot entirely pointless, and yeah I can understand that point of view. We get dragged to a bizarre set of sequences set at a casino that ram a message of corporations and wealth down our throats, and we don't get a satisfactory payoff from it. But on the other hand it shows us that our protagonists are not flawless heroes who always win. They make mistakes. They're brash and impulsive.The Last Jedi tries very hard to drift away from the black-and-white, good vs evil that has defined the saga for so long. It flirts with shades of grey instead. Luke is no longer a hopeful optimist who always does the right thing, but he hides away in shame of a mistake he made that cost lives. Rey is not the infallible hero she's been built up to be as she delves deep into the depths of darkside willingly, without resisting. Kylo Ren grows beyond just being the petulant Anakin-copy, himself seeking a new world order that is greater than anything that has come before, neither light nor dark.An early theory I had during the movie pertained to a developing relationship between Kylo and Rey. They're connected across lightyears by the force and share conversations with one another where they open up and learn more about each other. So my theory was this; maybe Rey's importance in the saga has nothing to do with her parentage, her past, but instead is because of her future. Her destiny is to join Kylo and together they bring balance to the force with force-neutral children that are neither light or dark. Rey and Kylo themselves are neither extreme either, and so bringing balance to one another. As the film went on this theory started to deteriorate, so in a couple of years I'll probably look like a complete idiot (or you never know, I might look like a genius). And yet the fact I was so readily given this open interpretation for where the franchise might go has me excited. The subversions of The Last Jedi have effectively wiped the slate clean again, opening the way for Episode IX to go in any direction.Of course I'm a visuals guy, always have been and always will be, so I have no doubt that a big part of my love for this movie stems from the fact that it is without doubt the best looking Star Wars movie to date. Everything from composition to colours to the quality of CGI and puppetry is grade A stuff. The third act on Crait is simply beautiful to watch, with icicle wolves running around, and red crystals beneath salt-flats that ploom up creating such a gorgeous contrast between white and a rich red. The big climax between Rey, Kylo, and Snoke is also a feast for the eyes, as the clean red and black interior of Snoke's throne room is soiled by flame and betrayal, and his red-clad guards burst into fervent action in one of the most enticing lightsaber battles the franchise has seen. Also love it or hate it, but Leia drifting back to the ship through the debris is fantastic just to watch.But okay, I acknowledge that this film isn't flawless, and I can at least understand some of the criticisms levied it's way. For starters the pacing seems a little off. The big climax of the whole movie occurs at the end of the second act. The Rey/Kylo/Snoke, Finn/Rose/BB-8, and Poe/Leia/Holdo climaxes all occur at the same time, and once they've all been resolved that feels like when the movie should end. Instead the action drifts to a nearby planet where the remnants of the Resistance are holed up in a mine while the First Order continues their chase in giant, futuristic AT-ATs. On subsequent viewings this might all fly by a little better, but on first viewing it does start to drag a little as the third act kicks in.Then there's the jokes and one-liners. Now, I didn't mind them for the most part. Star Wars has always had jokes and one-liners, and not all of them land. The Last Jedi however opens with a super clunky joke that doesn't feel natural or particularly funny at all. It turns General Hux into a joke who we can't take seriously for the entirety of the movie. I mean I get it, it's another subversion of the arrogant Imperial officer who makes grand pronouncements and threats without looking passed his nose, but it just completely cheapened the character for later on. That said I did enjoy the caretakers of Ahch'to and their disdain for Rey, the Porgs, and many of the lesser one-liners sprinkled all over.Nonetheless I feel Last Jedi is one of the best Star Wars movies made. It's not without fault, and some things could've been done better, like Snoke, and Poe's disobedience, and I admit I'd have liked more continuity to have stayed intact from Force Awakens (not like Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi haphazardly retconned things from New Hope after all, right?), but the good far, far, far outweighs the bad in my opinion, and I can't wait to see it again. I give it a solid 9/10, up with Empire, Revenge, and Rogue One as the best Star Wars movies.",9,1,4,19 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Third Best Marvel Movie
","Guardians of the Galaxy is a triumph of Hollywood filmmaking. It's probably one of the biggest risks in the history of blockbuster movies; an unknown property with unknown characters played by (relatively) unknown actors written and directed by an unknown director about a team including a talking racoon, and a tree. No studio in their right mind would ever have picked that up. Marvel is a studio of risk-taking though. Their risks keep paying off and as a result they keep paving the way not only for superhero movies, but for the movie business as a whole. They even greenlit a sequel before it was even released. Well, Guardians of the Galaxy is another roaring success.A big worry for Guardians was setting up a team, developing the characters, and giving them a good enough plot to warrant them all together. I mean, there's a reason why Avengers was built up with solo movies to develop each character individually. Again, this is another thing Guardians was successful with, as each character is developed really well. They're each given a past, a specific role on the team, their own personal quirks, differing goals and aspirations, but never at the expense of the rest of the movie. Guardians, unsurprisingly, was also full of comedy. While previous attempts in Iron Man 3 and The Dark World completely failed, Guardians was absolutely hilarious. There are just so many moments that had the whole cinema laughing, from Groot constantly repeating that phrase, to Drax taking everything literally, to Rocket in general. The post-credits sequence is also played for laughs (it doesn't tease anything, so don't feel you have to stay through all the credits) with a surprising cameo that I won't spoil. Acting is...well it's a good effort. Chris Pratt does a really good job of Starlord, especially with the amount of work he had to put into his body. I mean, it wasn't long ago he was quite podgy, and here he's shirtless with a chiselled torso. Dude bulks up really well. On the actual acting side of things he does a great job balance the comedic elements with the more serious and heart-felt moments. If this doesn't make a star out of him, nothing will. Zoe Saldana is on top form as Gamora. Besides the fact she looks gorgeous (even in green) and is as capable as ever with the action scenes, she also manages to balance comedy with emotion. Bradley Cooper pretty much owns the movie, even though it's only his voice that's present. He manages to do so much with it. He puts so much emotion in, from his bouts of rage to his more touching moments when the truth comes out. Again though he does a marvellous job with his character's humour. 50% of what makes Rocket so funny is Cooper's delivery. Dave Bautista shows how he really can't act, I'm sad to say, although it's a hell of a lot better a job I expected. The script he was given is full of words you'd never expect a man of his physical stature to say in a movie, and like everyone else his comedic delivery is spot on. Maybe, though, the lines were a bit too much for him as he does stumble a bit here and there, and beyond a lust for vengeance, he doesn't really portray any other emotion other than bland. Then there's Vin Diesel who just says 'I am Groot' in three or four slightly different ways. It's not bad, but it's hardly taxing work ripe with opportunity.Wrapping this up with the visuals, which are as good as always. Rocket and Groot are rendered to absolute perfection, as are all the sci-fi backgrounds and ships. There's a number of shots that are almost breathtaking, including one of Starlord thrusting himself across a cloudy green void to clutch Gamora, and Groot lighting up the interior of a ship with lots of glowing spores. Of course the 3D really helped these shots pop out, giving them a huge amount of depth, but they will always be seared into the back of my eyes. James Gunn. You the man. Only you could have made Guardians of the Galaxy work so well, effortlessly balancing humour with genuine emotion. It's very rare for me to find myself bawling my eyes one minute and laughing my head off the next and not feeling put off by either. Guardians of the Galaxy looks great, sounds great, adds depth to the MCU with a plot of itself that is quite layered, with three-dimensional characters and moments that'll make you laugh and cry. I cannot praise Guardians of the Galaxy enough, although I feel subsequent rewatches will start to show the cracks. 8/10",9,7,13,5 August 2014
Silence," Three Hours of People Suffering in the Name of Faith
","Silence follows two Jesuit priests in Japan; the last Jesuit priests, since the others have either been pushed out or executed. They find themselves in remote villages desperate for Christian guidance, but must spend their days hidden or otherwise risk being seen by the Inquisitor's men (or sold out to them), while they preach and hold mass at night. Once a visit from the Inquisitor spooks the villagers, the priests are separated and sent away. Rodrigues is of course captured by the Inquisitor and endures gruelling trials and torture to push him to apostatise. In a way, Silence is Scorsese's Passion of the Christ (more so than Last Temptation), as the characters are put through hell in the name of their faith. It's nearly three hours of watching people suffer. Silence is not an easy film to watch. If watching all these people suffering does anything though, it shows the power of faith, and how people cling to their beliefs to the bitter end, willing to endure whatever it takes in the name of what they believe. In this regard, Silence is exquisite food for thought. It highlights both the strengths and weaknesses to religion, and portrays it's different followers. It looks at the power of symbolism, while simultaneously looking at the corruption of idolism. The last remaining Japanese Christians are so desperate for validation from their God that they worship religious imagery at the risk of pain and death. One of the key ways the Inquisitor uses to root out Christians is by getting them to disrespect the imagery they idolise. Because they hold the power of the imagery so high, they refuse, and are subsequently tortured and put to death. However there is one glaring problem with Silence. At nearly three hours, it's long. This is a really long, dirge of a movie that goes on and on and on. It takes some interesting turns here and there, and the length is good to really drive home the struggle Rodrigues has to endure, but it makes it an unpleasurable watch. It's hard work, and unlikely to be a movie I will ever re-watch. It particularly drags on too long in each of it's two main settings; in the remote villages, and in the Nagasaki cells. I definitely feel a lot could have been trimmed off from these two acts. There were too many scenes in the villages, and Kichijiro's neighbouring village was largely unnecessary. The scenes in the Nagasaki cells could have benefited from being montaged. For instance, there's a scene where Rodrigues watches five Christians be tested by putting their foot on an image of Christ. Rather than condensing this, we see each of the five come up to the plate, refuse, and get sent back, one-by-one. What could've been summed up in thirty seconds takes nearly ten minutes.Of course being a film titled Silence, it would seem a bit weird not to mention the sound, which is again used really well. The film's score is made up predominantly of ambiance and natural sounds, such as the chirping of insects at dusk. The use of sound effects is really evocative in creating moods and guiding the narrative without the use of too much actual music. For instance, the screams of agony endured by prisoners in Nagasaki are blood-curdling, while Mokichi's hymn with his last breaths is filled with emotion. Then of course there's the use of silence itself, particularly at the film's climax. It's enough to make you sit up and pay attention (which for this film is important to have). Finally the acting is strong from almost everyone. Andrew Garfield carries the movie expertly and without ever wavering. His Portuguese accent slips every now and then, but not enough to be particularly noticeable. He deserves praise for living the suffering and really encapsulating the blind devotion of Rodrigues in spite of the pain he and others around him endure. Adam Driver is pretty good as his companion, fellow Jesuit priest Garrpe, who grows impatient with the locals and their misunderstanding of the Catholic faith. Liam Neeson doesn't appear all too often, but balances the mentor act he does so well with a more subdued and downtrodden performance, showing the suffering he has also endured and the psychological marks that leaves. The Japanese actors were all quite admirable too, particularly Tadanobu Asano as Rodrigues' interpreter, Yôsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro, and Shin'ya Tsukamoto as Mokichi. Although I must say I found Issei Ogata's Inquisitor a bit hammed up for my liking. I just couldn't take him seriously, undermining any sense of threat his character was meant to embody.In closing, Silence is not a movie you can enjoy. It's nearly three hours of watching people suffer and be tortured, and there's no real light at the end of the tunnel. It poses some interesting discussion points on the nature of faith and religious symbolism, but drags on too long and spends too much time hammering it's points. It's a very well made movie, with an interesting story, if imperfectly told, driven by captivating performances both Western and Eastern. However, if you have a vendetta against religion, or Christianity in particular, Silence is not the movie for you. I had two blokes behind me who scoffed any time anything remotely Christian was mentioned, who obviously had a bias against the story that was being told, and eventually walked out forty-five minutes in (and the screening was all the better without their obnoxiously loud talking as well). I give Silence an imperfect 7/10, and would recommend it for Christians and anyone with an open mind.",7,27,53,7 January 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Everything I had hoped for, but not perfect
","It's not perfect, and certainly not the best Marvel movie to date, but it's still everything I had hoped for (well most, at least). The story begins after the prologue at the end of Winter Soldier. The Avengers are converging on Baron Von Strucker as the last detachment of Hydra, who managed to obtain Loki's Sceptre (from the first Avengers). Stark and Banner's study of the sceptre reveals the dormant potential for artificial intelligence, and Stark decides to use this for one of his projects he pitches as a 'suit of armour around the world'. Unfortunately it's not quite what he hoped for, and Ultron is born with the usual machinations of a villainous AI; peace via the extinction of humanity.Joss Whedon manages to weave in some more character development for everyone amongst the plot, from Romanov's ballerina background, to Barton's secret family. We see Stark still torn up after the alien invasion of the first movie, Banner and Romanov develop a fledgling romance, Thor fearing what the future may bring, and Rogers still missing Peggy. We also get a truck-load of cameos from previous movies. Sam Wilson, James Rhodes, Maria Hill, Nick Fury, Erik Selvig, Heimdall, and of course Peggy Carter all make appearances here or there. However this leaves distinct holes where obviously an actors unwillingness or busy schedule prevented them from appearing; it's noted that neither Pepper Potts nor Jane Foster are present, despite being romantically involved with members of the team, and the reasons why aren't particularly great. Then there's the new characters, most notably Pietro and Wanda Maximoff as twins Von Strucker experimented on, and Vision who is essentially Jarvis in a semi-organic form. Von Strucker himself doesn't have as a big a role as I anticipated, serving as no threat at all, and Ulysses Klaue is introduced briefly to set up the Black Panther movie.On which note there is a hell of a lot of foreboding in Age of Ultron. Most obviously is the appearance of another Infinity Stone (or rather, re-appearance), as well as glimpses of the Infinity Gauntlet and Thanos himself. However somewhat less obviously is the amount of friction mounting between members of the team that will lead into Captain America: Civil War next year. It's starting to become very apparent who gets along with who, and more crucially who's at odds with who. Stark's actions are plenty enough to displease certain heroes, but also win over certain heroes as well. Lines are starting to be drawn in the sand. In short, I've never been more excited for either of the two 'Wars' on the horizon.What did throw me off a little bit was the amount of humour present in Age of Ultron. Let's face it, the trailers made it seem like a pretty bleak and serious movie, somewhat in the vein of Winter Soldier. However there are jokes aplenty that serve to lighten the mood and stay in keeping with the general tone Marvel has adopted of late (for better (Guardians) or worse (Iron Man 3)). For the most part, the humour hits the nail on the head, like the running jokes of Captain America's disdain for bad language and the worthiness necessary to lift Thor's hammer, which each garnered a number of laughs. It does verge on the goofy every now and then, but at least it never goes full Trevor Slattery.Unfortunately I will concede that every now and then it does undermine the tension and threat, most notably when it comes to Ultron. Did he really need some jokes to crack? It makes the threatening villain we saw in the trailers come across almost as a fumbling mess. It doesn't help that some of Ultron's best and most spine-chilling lines from the trailers were cut out of the movie entirely (including my favourite line; 'People would look to the sky and see hope...I'll take that from them first'). Furthermore the decision to give Ultron lip-like movements around his mouth just doesn't quite sit right with me. I mean, his face is made of metal plating, I have no idea how it's meant to bend and pinch so freely to make that kind of movement possible. I can understand the decision though, as the alternative would be a mouth that doesn't move (which I personally think would look more intimidating), but a moving mouth certainly shows his evolution from the body he initially took from one of Stark's drones. On that note, I didn't like Visions look either. It looked grade-A goofy, and the pink and turquoise just doesn't work together as a colour scheme.Age of Ultron is everything you might expect from Chapter Five of Phase Two of the cinematic universe. It fits in snuggly and acts as a great culmination of the movies before, and sets the seeds of movies yet to come. It's this connectivity between the Marvel properties that makes me love it all so much. They seem to have everything planned out and tease major developments well in advance. I think I may have literally squeed when the Infinity Gauntlet first appears. On which note Age of Ultron is the beginning of a vastly new era, with a whole new team of Avengers, a new status quo, and yes a hero does die, but I won't spoil who. I give Age of Ultron a thoroughly enjoyable 8/10.",8,6,17,24 April 2015
Elysium," Very enjoyable, but not perfect.
","The plot is...actually fairly simplistic. The rich live on a space station with super-technology that enables them to live 100% healthy lives for hundreds of years, while the poor live on a diseased and polluted Earth struggling daily to get by. Max suffers a serious injury that will leave him dead in under a week unless he can get to the super medical facilities on Elysium so he makes a deal with a gangster, and ends up holding the key to re-addressing balance to humanity. There's a couple of sub-plots here and there, including Max's childhood friend and the Elysium secretary of defense attempting to stage a coup, but by the halfway mark all the threads have merged together into a simple action movie; get to Elysium, kill the bad guy, heal humanity. It's not particularly taxing, but it's an engaging and interesting storyline that'll have you hooked from beginning to end, with a few unpredictable turns here and there.Naturally Blomkamp has injected a fair dose of politics into the movie, highlighting the gulf of disconnect between the rich and the poor. He also has a stab at the state of healthcare in some countries (of course I can't say it's that bad in every country as the UK has pretty good healthcare) by pointing out the elitism of Elysium's healthcare beds that can heal any and all ills a human being might have by simply re-atomising them. All-in-all though, while the messages are there, they're not as strong or focal as they were in District 9, and really most the themes are exactly the same. A simple case of 'been there, done that'.The acting quality was a bit all over the place I have to admit. Matt Damon, Alice Braga and William Fichtner all played their parts well, but were maybe a bit too hampered by being under- developed. Literally the only solid development any of the characters get is a couple of flashbacks to Max and Frey as children, and a nun giving Max a locket with a picture of the Earth inside. They're not just cardboard cut-outs either. While they're underdeveloped, there's still enough in them to make them engaging enough. I just feel a little more could've been done. Jodie Foster was unfortunately a huge disappointment. This is a far cry from her Oscar- nominated performances. She just looked awkward and like she was trying too hard, and she had a weird accent. I think she was trying to sound French, but she just failed and it became really distracting. Sharlto Copley on the other hand was unsurprisingly brilliant. He really seemed to tap into the mindset of such a disturbed sociopath and he ate up every scene with his creepiness. He was also a badass with a beard, a katana, and some sort of energy shield. The villain-of-the-year award goes to Copley's Kruger!The CGI was absolutely amazing, which again is hardly surprising coming from Blomkamp. There's a huge attention to detail paid to the shuttles and Elysium itself, both visually and thematically. One example being how Elysium is completely open to space, it's own atmosphere maintained by it's inherent gravitational pull from it's spin. It's a really great concept that probably isn't as unfeasible as you might think. Another thing I noticed was how the shuttle of John Carlyle, an Elysium citizen, is meant to be a Bugati. It had the sleek lines and curves of the Veyron, and had the standard red and black colour scheme, and even had a Bugati badge on the back. Being a Bugati Veyron fan, I liked that touch.The movie is also remarkably gory. I did not expect that all. It's not filled with gore, but what little of it there is really milks everything it can. One of the weapons Kruger uses literally blows people apart on the spot, so you get body parts flying all over the place, and there's one scene where a guy gets his face blown apart by a grenade, and then has it reconstructed in all it's gory detail via the super healthcare beds on Elysium. It's gruesome stuff. Oh, and of course Max's surgery to have the exoskeleton attached is not for the faint of heart. Elysium doesn't like you to imagine anything, it would rather show you.It's not all perfect though. The second half, and the climax in particular, lost it's way. I know Kruger is meant to be an unhinged guy, but his snap once on Elysium just came out of nowhere without any real explanation. To make it worse the inhabitants of Elysium just seem to bend- over and take it; a rogue special agent going crazy as well as a group of illegal's trying to muscle in. Where's the Elysium enforcer's in all of this? Why don't they get involved? The first half seems to make a big thing of the robot police force, but by the second half they're almost completely forgotten.I feel I could compare Elysium to Dark Knight Rises, where the first two-thirds of the movie are fantastic, the big climax is a real letdown full of plot holes, and the closing scenes go back to brilliance to close everything up with an emotional edge. And it really is an emotional edge from Elysium. I actually started to well up, not only at how sad it was, but how happy it was too. It was a somewhat predictable ending, but yes, I was almost brought to happy-tears. While Elysium wasn't perfect, I can't say it was a disappointment as I definitely enjoyed myself. I give it a very good 8/10, but only just.",8,0,1,27 August 2013
The King," Slow and Inaccurate, but Solid Nonetheless
","The King follows Henry V from his drunken antics as a prince through to his first victory in France. Of course first thing's first with this kind of movie; it's exactly that, a movie. This is not a documentary. It's a piece of thrilling entertainment based just as much on Shakespeare's play than it is on actual historical records. To treat it as anything other than that would simply be unfair to the film's intent. There's a lot in here that isn't accurate, such as the plot behind the scenes, or the strategies used at the Battle of Agincourt. But on the flipside there's a lot here that does feel authentic, and I feel like it struck the right balance between fictional entertainment and brutal realism.The movie can feel slow at times, as long stretches of time can go by without anything bombastic happening. The first hour of the movie follows Henry as a prince, resisting the crown and seeking solace in his own brand of peace, before being thrust into leadership after a dying father. While slow, I didn't mind this section much because it took the time to really establish Henry's character and his borderline pacifist nature. It gave him trauma and motivation in an abusive father, and laid the stage for the French campaign. It's not until halfway into the movie that the French campaign even begins, and even then it's a slow start thanks to a castle siege depicted as slow and uneventful as a castle siege would really be. It all culminates in the Battle of Agincourt and the French surrender, leaving ten to fifteen minutes for a coda at the end, complete with story-defining plot twist. Pacing is not this movie's strongest suit, that's for sure, but for me it never dragged and kept my attention throughout.Arguably The King's most visceral aspect would be its battles and fights. While the Battle of Agincourt lacks the historical accuracy of the strategies utilised, it worked because the focus was put on the press in the muddy field, complete with claustrophobia and brutal, ugly brawling. In many ways it felt reminiscent of the Battle of the Bastards in Game of Thrones, which is certainly no complaint. When charged by a vanguard of cavalry, the hero of the battle doesn't casually step aside and carve the horse in half, dismounting its rider. Instead the horse crashes into the line and the hero is catapulted off his feet into the line of men behind him. Similarly Henry's challenge early on starts out like knights in shining armour, but a sword fight quickly becomes a wrestling brawl on the ground, clanking armour plates, and exhausted breathing from both parties. Even the siege in its uneventful presentation still felt surprisingly visceral as three trebuchets launch flaming projectiles into the castle day and night, and the looming threat of hunger and disease is never forgotten.Another aspect in The King's favour lies in its pure acting talent. I didn't always dig it as sometimes it felt like certain actors were taking the film too seriously, begging for awards with gravely whispers erupting into dominating shouts, but that's honestly not much of a criticism. Hey actors, how dare you take your craft seriously and put out great performances! Timothée Chalamet was the worst offender for this, but he pulls off the role of Henry V so well, balancing the tender desire for peace with the anger and authority required to be a strong leader. His portrayal was definitely full of layers worthy of dissection. Ben Mendelsohn chewed up his small runtime the only way he can, Sean Harris played the advisor William with as much ingenuity as required, Joel Edgerton was the perfect best friend, tired soldier, and wise mentor. And then there's Robert Pattinson who took his role as The Dauphin as seriously as was necessary and had fun sinking into the role of a slimey, privileged villain. His French accent was not authentic at all, but deliberately so, mocking Henry and the English and insulting their language.The third big plus for The King comes from Nicholas Britell's domineering score as it sweeps high and low and keeps the plodding pace of the movie moving ever forward. It embraces the medieval setting with authentic-sounding instrumentation and composition, while also maintaining a brooding string section throughout. It is equal parts melancholic and bombastic, changing as required without losing its uniform tonal quality that brings the whole film together. Similarly Adam Arkapaw's cinematography once again proves he deserves to be up there with Deakins and Hoytema. Every shot is oozing with artistic merit worthy of being framed, and the Battle of Agincourt wouldn't have been nearly as spectacular to watch without his eye behind it. For me his most successful shots lie in the more subdued and tender moments, framing a solder against a sunset, or the montage of trebuchets in the siege, or the decidedly muted colour pallet in the royal courts.The King has some big problems, mostly in pacing, historical accuracy, and mumbling line delivery, but when it does something right, it goes the extra mile. Chalamet is great as Henry V, offering us an interesting character to follow and sink our teeth into, the battles and action scenes feel true to realism despite how inaccurate they might be, focussing on both the thrill and monotony of war and not hiding from the brutality of either, and in almost all technical regardless I don't have a single complaint. I give The King a good 7/10, pushing up the higher end to an 8, but not quite topping the crest.https://qyrosmovies.blogspot.com/",7,1,2,14 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Funny, Emotional, Smart, Characterful, Beautiful, not as good as Vol.1
","I'll get this out of the way first; Vol. 2 doesn't beat it's predecessor, in fact it may not even equal it. Guardians of the Galaxy was a pure masterpiece of a Space Opera, and Vol. 2 never quite meets the same nigh-perfection of the first film. But I won't waste this review comparing the two movies, because the only result of that is a negative impression of Vol. 2, and that's not the impression I want to paint at all.Vol. 2 is a Guardians movie through-and-through, utilising the same charm of the first movie to re-create it's unique footprint in the moviescape. It's bright and colourful, it's filled to the brim with a unique brand of humour, it touches on a deeper, more emotional core, it's soundtrack is made up of classic rock and pop from the 70s, and it puts it's characters before story or action. Nonetheless it does feel painfully aware of where it's come from and attempting to recapture that same feeling of the first, to the point where it can sometimes feel a little forced or unnatural.The story, in an Empire Strikes Back kind of way, splits the team up, gives the 'main' character a father figure, and brings them all together at the end. Fatherhood and family is a massive theme that permeates almost every conversation in the movie. Starlord finally gets to meet his father after nearly thirty years, while Drax continues to struggle with the loss of his wife and daughter, and Gamora and Nebula come to terms with the awful treatment they suffered from their father. Yondu and Rocket share a heartbreaking moment when they realise their loss of any kind of family gives them more in common than they ever thought as well. The Guardians are starting to turn into the space-faring version of Dom Toretto's team in the Fast and Furious franchise, but arguably do it better and touch at the emotional core of family better than any Fast and Furious movie ever could.Vol. 2 is probably the funniest movie in the entire MCU so far, but that's not necessarily a good thing. I mean, yeah, it is. It's full to the brim with jokes, gags, one- liners, and running humour. It's easily the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, and remains quotable long after the credits have rolled. However when it comes to jokes, it just seems to keep chucking them at the screen in the hopes that most of them stick. Unfortunately a lot of them don't. Some of the gags feel forced in and ruin the already shaky pacing of the movie. One prominent example being a cool 360 montage of the team assembled and ready to take on the villain, except it's ruined by a rock knocking one of them over in the name of laughs. It was a cool moment, it didn't need comedy to make it more enjoyable than it already was.The same criticism applies to the film's emotional moments. I'm not going to lie, Vol. 2 is surprisingly emotional, balancing out the overabundance of humour with some really serious, heartbreaking moments that offer a true insight into the deeper characters of the cast. But again it felt like some of it was forced in. As mentioned, Yondu and Rocket's exchange is really good, and Nebula's desperation to 'win' over her sister has a sad tinge to it, but it never quite reaches the complete gut-wrenching emotion of the first film (yeah, I'm sorry, I had to use the comparison here). Vol. 1 has the second most tearjerking opening of any movie, and learning about Drax and Rocket's past was a genuine punch to the gut when you realise how far they've fallen from pure loneliness and lack of love and family. Vol. 2 never quite hits it despite it's numerous attempts. The closest it gets is the funeral at very the end.Finally (yes, finally) the soundtrack is unsurprisingly great; full of 70s classics from the likes of Fleetwood Mac to Cat Stevens, Electric Light Orchestra to Parliament, Sam Cooke to George Harrison. Sometimes they serve a narrative purpose in the movie, sometimes they're used to create a juxtaposition to what's going on on-screen, and sometimes they're just used really well as part of the soundtrack's core sound. The score by Tyler Bates is also pretty good, but falls into the forgettable nature most Marvel scores suffer from. That said the Avengers theme does protrude on more than one occasion which was a really nice touch, tying what is ultimately an added extra in the MCU to the wider universe.Vol. 2 does not compare favourably to the first one three years ago, but as Vol. 1 was a near masterpiece, that's not saying a whole lot. On it's own merits, or even compared to other Marvel movies, Vol. 2 is still pretty great. It has Marvel's most engaging villain since Loki, the most emotional resonance since Vol. 1, and is likely the funniest movie so far. It's largest downfall is trying too hard to recapture the charm of the original rather than forging it's own path. It throws in a lot of attempts to build up the Cosmic side of Marvel, and a lot of them work really well, but it sometimes detracted from the main story a little. The Sovereign's role in the climax was used as little more than motivation to come back in Vol. 3 and introduce a fan-favourite, for instance. I give Vol. 2 a low 9/10; not as good as Vol. 1, or even Winter Soldier (2014 is still Marvel's best year by far), but it's still up there with the best of them; a solid superhero movie, a solid space opera. Bring on Ragnarok later in the year when the line between Avengers and Cosmic is blurred even further!",9,12,21,29 April 2017
The Shape of Water," A Beautiful Romantic Fantasy that could've gone Terribly.
","Imagine Creature from the Black Lagoon as a Romance. Elisa is a mute cleaner at a government facility who becomes enchanted by the latest addition to the facility's roster; an Amphibian Man caught in South America and hauled all the way up to America by a government agent called Strickland, who seeks to exploit the creature to get one up on the Russians in the height of the Cold War. As the movie goes on, Elisa and her friends break the Amphibian Man out to save it from certain death, and an oddball romance blossoms between the two. Yes, it's a concept that sounds completely terrible on paper, and yet Del Toro manages to craft a beautiful and moving film out of it.Being a Del Toro movie, The Shape of Water is not safe by any means (I mean, the entire concept of a woman falling in love with a sea creature is a pretty big hint). One of the opening montages shows Elisa in full-frontal nudity pleasuring herself in the bath, showing that the movie is not afraid of the sexual connotations, and is in fact willing to embrace them, without being titilising. Similarly, it's not afraid to show the more graphic and gorier aspects of bringing a sea creature home to a house full of cats. While it is maybe a little tame compared to Del Toro's previous works, it still feels fundamentally like the only thing Del Toro could craft. He manages to include the more graphic and risky moments that makes the film feel real, without losing it's fairytale, fantasy leanings. The sexuality doesn't undercut the romance, and the gore doesn't undercut the beauty or the film's themes.On the note of themes, The Shape of Water is rife with them. It's a story about misfits and the loneliness they endure because of it. Elisa is mute which makes her easy to ostracise. She struggles without meaningful companionship, and on the entire cleaning staff only has one friend; Zelda. Zelda is a fairly normal person beyond her skin colour. Being black in the early 60s wasn't an especially kind time, and neither is being a woman, and she suffers both racism and sexism daily. Elisa's other friend is her neighbour Giles, who is not only an old man watching his youth fade away, concealing it with tupées, but is also gay in a time when it's not acceptable, and suffers similar rejections to companionship that Elisa does. The Amphibian Man goes without saying.Another theme is that of masks, or hiding who you truly are. Strickland, on the outside, is a successful family man complete with two kids, nice house, cadillac, smart suits, and a wife who beckons to him, but on the inside he's racist, sexist, fetishes the silence of women (both literally and figuratively), and the threat of losing gradually tears him apart. Doctor Hoffstetler, the main scientist on the project is a covert Russian spy tasked with ensuring the Americans don't gleam more from the Amphibian Man than them. Yet his deception is twofold, as he doesn't even work unquestioningly for the Russians. He has too much of a scientific curiousity of the Amphibian Man, caring for it in his own way, and ultimately helping Elisa to break him free. Then of course there's Giles masking his age with a tupée. Elisa's mask is much more subtle, and unknown even to her.Each character is played with depth and nuance by each cast member, and there's absolutely no weak links. Michael Shannon does what he does best as the menacing antagonist who's slowly falling apart himself. A quintessentially masculine man who ultimately can't keep up the charade. Michaul Stuhlbarg plays Hoffstetler with an empathy that makes his character much softer than I imagine he would have appeared on the page. Octavia Spencer, like Shannon, does what she does best as a middle-aged, working class black woman brought down by her homelife and her environment. Richard Jenkins is pretty killer as Giles, tapping into his sensitive side with such finesse that what could otherwise have felt like a pretty cliché gay character instead is filled with depth and charm.Of course the real power house is Sally Hawkins who is as fantastic as always as Elisa. Without saying a word, she manages to convey such an emotional depth that will make her the envy of her colleagues. One scene in particular has her appealing to Giles affection for her, to get him to help her break the Amphibian Man out. It's one of those scenes that would be a career-defining monologue in any other movie, but of course in Shape of Water it is done without dialogue, and instead conveyed almost entirely in sign language and body language, and Sally Hawkins kills it. The fluency and conviction with which she performs is captivating to watch, and it's hard not to get invested in Elisa's plight.On a more technical standpoint The Shape of Water doesn't fail to deliver either, at least not for the most part. The general aesthetic of the movie is like that of the 50s and 60s, but painted in such a way that gives it an oddly fantastical edge. I've seen it compared to the video game Bioshock, which feels like an accurate comparison. There are a number of shots that feel like paintings. However what makes each shot look so good and enthralling is the sharp lighting with harsh brights and shadows, which can make the film feel a little dark (but then again, it's Del Toro, and it still looks great). The score by Alexandre Desplat is also really good, with a memorable theme.But on the note of music strikes my only real complaint with the movie. There's one scene that should've been a hugely powerful glimpse into Elisa's desires, but it decides to portray this by shifting to black and white and giving us a musical number. Maybe I'm biased because I hate musicals (at least ones that aren't family films), but I never find random musical numbers in otherwise fairly serious movies ever work, and The Shape of Water is no exception. It's jarring, doesn't feel particularly well done (especially compared to the rest of the movie), and the emotions it wants to portray could've been done much better another way. It's a bold move, and thematically fits, so for that I give Del Toro kudos, but it just felt a little tacked-on and unnecessary, breaking the movie's pace for a brief extravagance.The Shape of Water is ultimately a very beautiful movie though, there's no denying that. It toes the line of something that could've gone terribly wrong, but somehow Del Toro has managed to give us a romantic fantasy for the ages. I give it a high 8/10.",8,30,54,20 February 2018
The Fountain," Every Aspect Thought Of.
","This is a true art film, not necessarily because of it's inaccessibility, but because every aspect and every detail has been thought of and planned. You watch it once and you're lifted out of the seat your sitting in and taken on an enchanting journey. You watch it twice and you begin tapping into this drug of a movie. You start seeing things you never saw before. The themes sink in further to your soul and you feel entirely enlightened...I've seen this film the good end of 10 times (would be more, but I really don't want to ruin it by over-watching it), and every time I found something new, be it the unified gold colour connecting all the stories, or the inherent shapes special to that story.Flawlessly perfect in almost every respect. The music is original, haunting and inspiring, the visuals are a treat to the eyes, like a caramel fudge cake is to the tongue, the acting is moving and powerful, the directing is efficient and skilled.Rachel Weisz's acting accurately portrays a wife just waiting for the end and Hugh Jackman couldn't be any better as a man on a mission to save his love, and lose it respectively.Every scene is placed there for a reason, every prop and every footstep. This is a sci-fi epic that, although contains plenty of eye-boggling visuals effects, isn't reliant on them. This film reaches a plain of intelligent and philosophical resolve.",10,1,2,4 April 2009
Sausage Party," Entirely Without Subtlety
","Imagine a crude and explicit version of Toy Story, but swap the toys for food, and you've got Sausage Party in a nutshell. Frank the sausage and Brenda the bun can't wait to get picked up off the shelf, taken home, and shoved inside one another in the most sexual fashion. Like most foodstuffs of this particular supermarket, they believe that the gods (read as: us) live in a place of paradise just beyond the automatic doors, and they come in every day to select the lucky individuals to liberate. Of course the reality is that they get cut, cooked, eaten, and thrown away, but the hope of a better afterlife is enough to keep the store's atmosphere bright and hopeful for it's many denizens. It's a world that's promptly shattered when an item is returned ranting and raving about the horrors he's seen, and a suicide leads to Frank and Brenda out of their packages and alone on the shop floor.Being a Seth Rogen movie, you simply cannot be surprised at the sheer depravity of crude this movie devolves into, but I kind of was. There's no sugar-coating here, and not an awful lot of subtext either. When they mean sex, they say it and describe it in the most over-the-top, innuendo way. I mean if the whole concept of a sausage wanting to insert himself into a bun for pleasure doesn't clue you in to the depths this movie will go, nothing will.With what freedoms the animators were accorded due to the characters all being food, there are some pretty graphic sequences. Even when it doesn't use innuendo or metaphor, it doesn't hold back. Banana's have their faces peeled off, sausages are sliced in half, carrots are eaten alive, cans of spaghetti have their 'guts' spilling out over the floor, and there is a literal bloody eyeball rolling around. I can handle my gore, and while this wasn't exactly gory, it still hit me as a little disturbing.While it's far from subtle in it's approach to just about everything, Sausage Party isn't all shock and explicitness. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it a clever movie, it does have it's moments of wit. A big theme of the movie is religion. The foodstuffs worship the gods that pick them and take them to 'The Great Beyond' and when met with the realisation that all is not what they imagined, they deny it and carry on in ignorance. It's like a Christian being shown proof of Evolution. All the same arguments are there. There's also a great exchange between a hebrew bagel and a Muslim lavash who have found themselves sharing an aisle. They're asked if they could just share it; it's big enough, and they just look at each other and laugh. Palestine in a nutshell. There's also the sourkraut who want to wipe out the juice, and a group of non- perishables (one native American) who sit around a marshmallow fire smoking weed from a kazoo.These religiously tinged jokes were probably the ones I found the funniest (plus the toilet roll). But a lot of the jokes are typical Seth Rogen affair, relying maybe a little too much on crass sexuality and language to appeal to your inner teenage boy. Hurr hurr the sausage looks like a penis, so lets put it inside a vaginal-looking bun, and dangle it between a human's legs. Hurr hurr, douche's clean out vaginas, so lets make this douche (played, humorously, by Parks and Rec's own The Douche) obsessed with cameltoes and putting himself in holes.I like a good Seth Rogen movie every now and then, and I figured Sausage Party had enough of an original concept to mark it with some of his best. Unfortunately it just tried too hard. It went too far with the freedom and pressure a cartoon offers for an adult audience. I'm sure they had a lot of fun making cute little carrots swear, or imagining what sexual intercourse between a taco and a bun would look like (spoiler: they use a sausage as a strap-on), but for me I feel they could've concentrated a little more on the satirical element built-in rather than falling back on the same dick and stoner jokes Rogen's movies are always rife with. A very adult and graphic cartoon about food is a fresh idea, but the jokes that flesh it out are the same jokes we've heard a million times before. It did get a few audible laughs out of me though, so it's not a complete failure. I give Sausage Party an above average 6/10. Would I watch it again? No, probably not. Maybe I'm more of a prude than I thought?!",6,1,3,20 September 2016
Joker," The Worst Part of Having a Mental Illness is People Expect You to Behave as if You Don't
","Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, the man who would be Joker. The entire movie is a character study on this man, with little themes interlaced such as mental illness and the divide between the wealthy and the poor. Unlike other attempts at the Joker's origin, this one did not take one bad day, but years and years of relentless abuse, trauma, and depression. We watch Arthur as he goes from one miserable day to the next, as everything gets worse and worse, and then he gets kicked while he's down for good measure (sometimes literally). This makes it a long, miserable, and uncomfortable viewing experience. The character we all know as Joker is barely present until the film's third act. Until then it's just Arthur Fleck and his descent into madness in a cruel and uncaring world.Joaquin Phoenix deserves every drop of praise he's getting. Every little bit of it. He's dream casting for a role like this, as it feels like Joker was written for him and only him. He's always been fantastic with tormented characters, those who skirt the borders of insanity. And not just movie insanity, but actual insanity. The darkness one's mind goes to when all hope is lost and happiness is an unknowable entity, when waking up every morning feels like stepping into a cold void, where you're trapped in your own head, you can't tell what's real and what's delusion. Phoenix taps into those feelings like a walk in the park. He slips into the role so well you have to keep slapping yourself to remind you you're empathising with a sociopath. His take will divide audiences. Some will find him hilarious, like a dark mirror of Charlie Chaplin, while others will watch him with intense sadness.Nothing encapsulates this better than his laughs. Yes, laughs, plural. Phoenix is not happy with just one iconic laugh. Instead he gives Joker a number of distinct laughs, and each of them are just as unnerving and characterful as the others. His fake laugh is the closest to a typical Joker laugh we get. He uses it at odd, inappropriate moments, or as an attempt to fit in with those around him. The way he cuts from a serious expression to manic laughter, and then back to a serious expression is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. He's lonely and detached from society. He doesn't know what makes a good joke. He doesn't find humour in the same things everyone else does, so in an effort to appear normal he puts on a fake laugh; over-the-top and terrible. His other laugh is an involuntary tick due to a mental condition, either from illness or injury. It's loud and hearty. And yet also grossly inappropriate. This time it isn't Arthur trying to fit in, it's a reflex he can't help, and usually comes out in moments of great stress or sadness. These moments are uncomfortable to watch because you can feel his desperation to make them stop. These are tragic, painful laughs masking tears.The other star of the movie is Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting and upsetting score. It's a stripped-down orchestral score, centred on a handful of cellos. It evokes the tragic nature of Arthur's life, while also remaining dark and tense, putting you at constant unease. It uses silence and atmospheric lulls brilliantly, allowing the rest of the film to breathe before the overpowering single Cello line bursts back in. Even in Joker's final triumphant moment at the end of the film, the score still feels overpoweringly dark and brooding. This is no hero we're witnessing, this is a villain of pure evil and insanity.Joker is not your average comic book movie. Go in expecting a typical superhero origin and you'll be disappointed. There's no antagonist, no brazen action sequences. It's slow and methodical, the violence is sudden and disturbing, but used incredibly sparingly. Also for a film entitled 'Joker' it's not particularly funny either. It has its moments of genuine humour for sure, but usually the level of comedy is so dark you'd feel bad for laughing at it. There was a guy in my screening who, much like Arthur, was laughing at the most inappropriate moments and literally applauding the violence. It was like Arthur was in the cinema with me watching his own movie. It was unnerving, but mostly I couldn't understand how he didn't see the irony in it. You'll either find this movie a darkly hilarious comedy, or find the experience closer to a deeply upsetting traumatic event. We may never see another film like this, but it may also open the eyes and minds of major studios to what they can achieve with comic book material. An R-rated villain origin, in the style of a gritty indie drama, focussing on the depravity of mental illness. I give Joker a potentially industry-changing 9/10.",9,1,1,4 October 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," An Enjoyable Mess
","The main plot of the movie reads as a day-in-the-life story of Eddie Mannix, head producer of Capitol Studios, as he has to deal with kidnapped actors, potential PR disasters, and unhappy arrangements. However the plot gets muddled when it decides to make a big deal of every sub- plot. Of course the biggest and most peculiar is the abduction of Baird Whitlock by a group of communist screenwriters. It holds the most meat of the movie, and yet doesn't feature into the day-in-the-life approach of Eddie Mannix. He's just simply not that bothered by it; 'Give him a day, he'll turn up' Instead his side of the movie is padded out with the other sub-plots. Hobie Doyle is plucked from his lineless Westerns and assigned to a dialogue-driven period drama, DeeAnna Moran is dealing with a husband-less pregnancy that would look bad for the movie and the studio, and Thora and Thessaly Thacker compete for the latest exclusive in movie gossip. Mannix is the guy who ties these all together as he attempts to resolve them all (finding that, in the end, they all kind of solve themselves anyway).As with all of the Coen's movies, Hail, Caesar! does attempt some deeper meaning, although again like all of the Coen's movies, what exactly it's trying to say is buried deep beneath the bizarre and humorous story. It's most obvious angle, and also the principle supply of laughs, is the satire of the movie industry, particularly that of the 50s. It's riddled with movies-within- movies that riff on iconic stereotypes of Hollywood at that time; Westerns with silent protagonists, musicals with tap-dance scenes, religious epics with bombastic speeches, et al.Below that though is another theme, but if I'm honest, I'm not exactly set on what specifically the theme focuses on. On one hand it's about belief, as Eddie Mannix truly believes in the movies he's making, and that they matter, that the Thacker twins' audience will believe every bit of gossip they type up, Baird Whitlock succumbing to communist beliefs without too much of a struggle etc. On the other hand, this could all be seen as a riff on loyalty and authority; Mannix being loyal to his movies, his directors, his actors etc, Thacker twins being loyal to their audience in supplying them the gossip they desire, Hobie's loyalty to Mannix in tracking down the whereabouts of Baird etc. In truth it all comes off as unfocused. It definitely wants to say something, but the approach it takes muddles up the message on the way out.Comedy-wise, Hail, Caesar! isn't the Coen's funniest, but it doesn't completely flunk either. There were a number of jokes throughout the film that I did chuckle at, most notably the discussion amongst four religious figureheads is not only the film's high point, but also it's most amusing. They were so few and far between though that I can barely remember most of them, which isn't exactly promising.Acting was on top form from everyone. Josh Brolin's Mannix is a hard edge who's perpetually worried about doing the right thing and making the right choice. George Clooney's Whitlock is respectable and devoted to his job, but largely clueless to the real world around him. Alden Ehrenreich (who I found out today is the exact same age as me; born on the exact same day) was also pretty great as Hobie, who looks like a fish out of water on an indoors set, unable to speak his lines, and yet with a well-established idea of his place in the industry, doing as he's told, but smart enough to take his own initiative as well. Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Alison Pill, Clancy Brown, Wayne Knight, and Michael Gambon all make appearances of varying degrees, but none of which extensive enough to make any marked impression.Visually the movie is unsurprisingly beautiful watch. Hail, Caesar? Hail, Roger Deakins more like. There isn't really a lot I can say as Deakins' cinematography has yet to disappoint. He always makes the imagery in any movie he touches pop and stick in your mind's eye. In Hail, Caesar! he uses the subtle theme of movie vs reality and plays it up by making sure all the movie within a movie scenes don't look out of place, even when they have a cinema screen or camera viewfinder border. There's a couple of 'real world' scenes that are produced as if they're part of a movie within the movie as well which cements the visual goal of blurring reality.As I said, the Coen brothers either make great movies or awful movies; movies that are tight and focused and know exactly what they want to be, or movies that meander around pointlessly with nothing particularly important to say. Hail, Caesar! falls in the latter category. It lacks focus, it's never quite sure what it wants to be or what it wants to say, and it's large cast and number of sub-plots just muddies the whole narrative, ensuring that no sub-plot and no character really gets the attention they deserve. It's not a complete Coenflunk though. It looks and sounds great, and it's revision of 50s Hollywood tropes and clichés is spot on. When it does take the time to be funny, it garners a few hearty laughs, and the running jokes are sublimely subtle in their delivery. With all that considered, I give Hail, Caesar! an enjoyable 7/10. It won't rock your world, but there are worse ways to waste an hour and a half.",7,1,3,8 March 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Good Fun if you Don't Engage your Brain too much
","Kong vs Godzilla is a classic B-movie team-up, and in a bid to compete with Marvel and DC's cinematic universes, and with a reasonably successful Godzilla reboot under the belt, Legendary decided to recreate that iconic clash. Kong is the second movie in Legendary's Monsterverse, although it's the first one to really embrace the idea of a shared continuity with Godzilla.It's the early days of Monarch, the organisation that lead the investigations in Godzilla, and they're a laughing stock. There's no proof that any of their crackpot theories are true, so in a desperate bid they tack on to a survey team at the tail end of the Vietnam war. There's Monarch, made up of Bill Randa and Houston Brooks, a group of scientists headed up by Victor Nieves, a military arm lead by Colonel Packard, a tracker-for-hire, and a war photographer. They're instantly met with the sight of an angry Kong, separated, and spend the majority of the movie attempting to re-connect with each other, exploring the island as they go and uncovering the darker secrets it holds.As plots go, Kong is nothing particularly new or, unfortunately, interesting. They embark on the expedition, are immediately separated, spend the entire movie finding each other, and then they attempt to get off the island. That's literally it. The little niggles of story are sourced from character's various motivations, which range from stereotypical to just plain absurd. It doesn't help that character development is pretty much non-existent. There's no lead protagonist, with the film instead going for an ensemble of equal opportunity, which results in a lack of focus.But you know what, none of that really mattered much. Kong is absolutely a movie that chooses style over substance, and it's style is so superbly executed that nothing else really matters. I mean, it's a monster movie after all, and it takes that license seriously. It's all about monsters and big critters and explosive action between them. Kong fights helicopters, he fights an octopus, he fights weird lizard creatures from beneath, and he fights Samuel L Jackson. It's all a monster movie could need to stay entertaining.Of course it helps that the CGI is spectacular. I feel like I say this every time, and maybe that's just because that's where we are with CGI these days, but all the visual effects work is so detailed and realistic. Kong himself is a breathtaking piece of work, full of expression and natural movements (thank you motion capture), and every other monster featured enjoys the same devotion, from the swamp-covered oxen to the towering spiders with bamboo for legs. Hell, even the storm surrounding the island looks imposing and otherworldly, with streaks of red lightning providing a very real threat to the crew of the expedition.It's not just the CGI though. The cinematography gives the film such a unique appearance. It's the 70s in the Pacific, of course the natural colour pallet to take is one vibrant and full of greens, blues, and oranges. Visually it looks like a Vietnam war movie, with it's most obvious inspiration being Apocalypse Now. The choice of locations helps a lot as well, with wide, lush plains framed by towering rock-faces and hills covered in palm trees. I admit, one of my worries with Kong, before any footage premiered, was whether it would look even half as good as Godzilla. Thankfully, with Larry Fong responsible for the movie's appearance, I should never have worried. The long time Zack Snyder collaborator is responsible for making Snyder's movie's look unlike anything else, and he brings the same eye to Kong.In short, Kong: Skull Island is an adrenaline pumping action movie full of explosions, big monsters, and incredible visuals. It lacks substance, both in characters and story, but it's technically a very well-made movie and perfect for just idly chucking on for a bit of mindless fun. Let's be honest, it was never going to be a deep or profound experience full of twists and turns, although I would've liked to have cared for the characters a little more. I give Kong: Skull Island a superficially enjoyable 7/10.",7,1,3,14 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Worthy, if Flawed, Finale
","I put my hand up as one of the minority that actually supported the idea of three movies. More Middle Earth the better, especially if it's padded out with loads of extra background information and sets up the events of Lord of the Rings. By Desolation of Smaug, I had changed my mind. It was full of unnecessary scenes that could well have been cut, and the cliffhanger at the end needed resolution. So how did this extra third film pan out?Still a mixed bag if I'm honest. The first ten minutes are the last ten minutes of what Desolation of Smaug should've been. It brings closure to that movie enabling us to carry on with this one. If I had good enough video editing software and skills, I'd seriously consider splicing it back into Desolation for future enjoyment, making it a complete movie with a beginning, middle, and end. Anyway, this means Battle of Five Armies has an end, a beginning, a middle, and another end. It's too much, especially seeing as it's already pretty much a two hour fight scene. Adding another fight scene in at the beginning means you're tired of the destruction by the time we actually get to the meat of the movie.That's not to say there's no plot though. There's certainly enough, even if it does take up the whole first act. Thorin is driven mad by the riches he has won back, and his obsession with the arkenstone leaves him in a dark place. Meanwhile news has spread and the humans, elves, and orcs all want a piece of the mountain for one reason or another. Away from all that we revisit Gandalf and the White Council has they finally discover the identity of the Necromancer (spoiler, it's Sauron). This particular scene was probably the highlight for me as it teased much deeper concepts and mythology surrounding Middle Earth. Once all this is out the way though, it's literally two hours of these five armies fighting each other. Well all right, that's a bit of an exaggeration as the third act completely leaves the battle behind (and I mean completely, while it's still raging in the background) to focus on the more personal struggle between Thorin and Azog, and each of the entourages. After that's all dealt with, we rush to an end to bridge the two trilogies together, leaving more than a handful of loose ends (like, what happened to all the gold they were fighting over for the entire movie?)There's a lot of other things that annoyed me about Battle of Five Armies as well. Unfortunately the cringeworthy Kili/Tauriel romance is carried over and reaches peak cringe. Why Jackson thought that was a good idea is completely beyond me. Similarly the movie is plagued by Alfrid, who you may or may not remember as the Master of Lake Town's right-hand man. Why he gets any focus at all is completely beyond me. He should've been forgotten, or at least saved for the Extended cut. The film's biggest sin, however, was the constant last-minute-saviour. Seriously, take a shot every time someone got saved at the last minute and you'd be paralytic by the halfway point. When I say it's constant, I'm honestly not exaggerating. Almost every one-on-one battle ends with one, and there's a lot of one-on-one battles, often happening simultaneously. To balance it out there are a few deaths of main characters, but they're shocking only because you've gotten so used to saviours swooping in all the time.The visuals are unsurprisingly amazing, and in much the same vein as the previous Hobbit films. It can get a bit much here and there, but overall I didn't find it got in the way of enjoyment of the film at all. The highlight of the effects were undoubtedly the pre-Ringwrath bearers of the nine rings of men. Never have I seen ghosts/spirits put to film so believably. They're clear and see- through, and yet definitely present; they're detailed and identifiable. I think the 3D helped them come alive as well, not because of the 3D, but because of the side effect you often get where text gets a subtle blurred shadow behind it. In this instance it actually benefited from that side effect.Acting was also pretty top-notch. Martin Freeman absolutely owns it. He's the same Bilbo he's always been, but he brings much more depth this time around, especially when he mourns the death of a certain character. I wasn't feeling particularly sad about it until his grieving, and then I was like 'damn, that's actually really sad. Poor Bilbo'. His extra little nuances are completely on point. Richard Armitage was also pretty great, especially as he got to play around with Thorin's darker side. We really did see another dimension, not just of Thorin's character, but also of Armitage's acting. I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot more of him in the future. Also Ian McKellan, Cate Blanchet, Ian Holm, Hugo Weaving, and Christopher Lee, no matter how big or small their roles, show us why they're the veterans.The Battle of the Five Armies is a worthy closure to The Hobbit trilogy, but that's not saying a lot. I'm not a big naysayer of the trilogy, as I quite enjoyed aspects of every movie (and have rated them accordingly), but none of them hold a flame up to even the weakest of the Lord of the Rings movies. As enjoyable as they are, there's just too many things wrong with them. I give The Battle of the Five Armies a good, but not amazing 7/10.",6,2,5,12 December 2014
The Secret Life of Pets," Entertaining and Beautiful, but Mediocre and Self-Serving
","Secret Life of Pets follows, as you can probably guess, the secret life pets have when their owners aren't around. Max is a terrier who's enjoyed all the love and affection he gets from his owner, but everyday when she goes to work, he's left alone, waiting for her return. His fellow pet friends, whose owners have also left for work all come and hang out, including Chloe the cat, Mel the pug, Sweet Pea the budgie, and Gidget the Pomeranian; who lives in the building next door so can only watch from afar. One day Max's owner comes home with a new pet; Duke the Newfoundland, who poses a difficulty to Max's comfort and way of life. What ensues is Max and Duke getting lost in New York City after constantly trying to get rid of each other, and Gidget and the rest of the gang trying to track them down. Along the way they meet Snowball and his sewer-dwelling gang of anti-owners, and Tiberius the predatory eagle, and Pop the disabled basset hound.Being a family movie, the story of Secret Life of Pets is unsurprisingly formulaic and predictable. Max and Duke constantly try to one-up each other, get lost and into trouble, but learn valuable lessons along the way, accept each other, and are found and return home safe and sound. There's no subtext, there's no twist, there's no complexity. It's a linear story with no surprises and not too much originality. But it's a family movie, they're not exactly known for their top-notch storytelling (not even Disney/Pixar are capable of breaking this).Secret Life of Pets isn't even particularly new in it's humour. The opening montage that introduces us to all the main characters is probably the movie's high point. Unfortunately this montage was pretty much the whole trailer, so watching the actual movie doesn't improve on that. We see Chloe gorging her face on food, Mel barking at squirrels outside his window, Sweet Pea pretending to fly through canyons on the TV, Buddy scratching himself with a mixer, and of course the poodle that changes the music to System of a Down. The humour from this point on is a little lacking. It's mostly slapstick to appeal to younger minds, and I'm sure it's successful in that regard, but I doubt anyone older than the age of ten will find the image of an aggressive gang leader rabbit pooping himself randomly hilarious.On the note of Snowball and his gang, I have read some controversy on message boards about how violent this film is, and I can't say I overly disagree. Snowball's gang are quite violent and provide the most threat to Max and his crew, but they're also overtly shown as the antagonists. In my opinion, kids could do with a little more darkness in their movies, so this was welcome, but it still wasn't exactly as scary or dark as movies were when I was younger.It's a breathtakingly beautiful movie. Between this and Minions, Illumination have demonstrated that they are second to none in creating breathtakingly detailed and photo-realistic vistas. Secret Life of Pets is bursting with vibrant colour and detail in every scene, from gorgeous cityscapes and autumnal colours, to textures of stone, brick and wood that are treated with excruciating detail. I can't state enough how incredibly impressed I was with the imagery in Secret Life of Pets. An opening scene of Max and his owner going for a walk in the park with vibrant autumnal leaves everywhere, and a towering, imposing city full of lights and colours behind was so crisp and clear.While Secret Life of Pets is absolutely aimed at those with younger minds, the movie is rife with references to other properties that only more experienced viewers will discover. I often found it was a little too heavy-handed in it's references, and maybe a little too self-serving. For instance, the amount of references to Minions and Despicable Me were uncountable. Minions made appearances in almost every scene, Gru can be seen in the background, as well as the unicorn, and the gnome from the Minions short. The love of Universal properties is also rife, including The Tonight Show, and Universal and Illumination's upcoming Sing. But there's others that are a little more thoughtful and subtle, like the sliding turtle taking out enemies in a reference to Super Mario, or a lizard bursting out from a disguise mirroring the chest- burster from Alien, Snowball's revolution against humanity as a homage to Animal Farm, a poster from Hitchcock's The Birds, and an emotional reference to 'Ricky' a la Boyz N The Hood.I know my review of Secret Life of Pets seems awfully scathing, but I did enjoy it in a lowest common denominator way. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's sometimes quite funny, and it's absolutely a visual feast for the eyes. I didn't feel I wasted an hour and a half of my life once the credits rolled, but it is an unremarkable movie. It doesn't try anything new or fresh, it makes no effort to seek longevity or classic status. It's a fleeting time that is mediocre and largely forgettable, made for the sole entertainment of children and nothing else. On that note, I can't call it a failure. But it's not a great movie. It's not a bad movie either, not by any means, but I don't feel not seeing it would result in missing out. I give Secret Life of Pets and enjoyably fleeting experience worthy of a 6/10. I'm sure my four-year old will love it though.",6,0,0,13 January 2017
Arrival," Best Movie of the Year?
","Arrival is the story of first contact between humanity and alien life, and how this first contact affects and shapes the globe. It is both epic and intimate in it's scope, focussing primarily on a linguist, Louise, as she attempts to communicate with the creatures. The whole movie is based around an element of first contact that is all-too-often glossed over entirely; communication. It evolves into a tense cat and mouse as eleven different nations try to figure out why the Heptapods are here and what they want, but refuse to share information with anyone but their political allies.The very first thing that surprised me about Arrival was it's emotional resonance. The movie opens with a heartbreaking string arrangement and a series of scenes that shows Louise's relationship with her daughter, leading to the tragic death at a young age. The movie had barely even started and I was already on the verge of tears. As Louise starts to unravel the mysteries of the alien writing she's given, she starts to see more and more of her daughter as they broach closer and closer to flat out hallucination (without going all the way, I might add).Being a Villeneuve movie you'll know, especially if you've seen Sicario, the level of tension he is able to create, and it is used here in spades. I mean this is very first contact with an alien species. This is a humanity-changing event. Arrival doesn't let you forget how monumental an occasion this is, and it puts you right in the characters shoes as they first encounter this new, unknown life. The first ascent to the ship is one of the best scenes I've experienced in a long time, and it is an experience. It harks back to Kubrick's 2001 in it's marriage of music and cinematography, amping up the suspense bit by bit as more and more is slowly revealedTalking of cinematography, the whole movie is breathtaking to watch. Louise's first glimpse of the shell, surrounded by rolling clouds flowing over the hills is captivating and perfect for setting the mood. But it doesn't let up, using times of day really well, like sunsets and sunrises to show not only the passage of time, but offer a glimpse into the character's feelings at the time. The use of composition and framing is not lacking either, especially in that first ascent into the shell, with long slow shots of the dark exterior framing the white wall at the other end.The visual effects as well are on another level. For the most part at least. The design of the Heptapods is harrowing, making their first appearance a sight that truly takes your breath away. As we see more and more of them, the sheer attention to detail employed by the effects team is nothing short of impressive. Even as Louise hallucinates to one appearing in her room, it looks so life-like and real. I had to constantly remind myself that they weren't real, because without knowing otherwise, I would've had no idea. Even the way they move is trance-like. The only criticism I had with the effects, and in fact the whole movie, was one sequence late in the movie where Amy Adams' hair is CGI'd to flow and move as if underwater, or without gravity. It was the only time the effects just didn't work and actually looked unbelievable. They should've just filmed her, at least partially, underwater to get that more realistic sense of how hair looks and behaves in that environment.The music was another massive strength of Arrival. The score by Jóhann Jóhannson is haunting, filled with alien sounds that sound like nothing that could be recreated on this plane of existence. It massive sounding horn sections burst in and out with such urgency that they make you sit up in your seat and pay attention, and the amount of tension brought in by the deep drones of cellos and tubas is palpable. There's also great use of a choir that adds a new dimension every now and then, just to underscore the orchestral arrangements. The film is also bookended with a very emotional piece by Max Richter called On The Nature of Daylight, and it punctuates and enhances the emotional resonance of those scenes perfectly, while also tying into something the movie references a lot, which is loops, circles, palindromes. It brings the end back to the beginning, showing that the music is not an afterthought when it comes to Villeneuve's approach to filmmaking.Arrival is a big contender for my movie of the year so far. Once the credits rolled, I was overwhelmed with feelings and thoughts and couldn't move for a few minutes. I spent the entire journey home in complete silence reflecting on what I had just witnessed. This is an alien invasion movie unlike any I have seen before, promoting peace and unity and hope like no other. It throws you in the deep end immediately with a heartbreaking tragedy that goes on to define the whole, breathtaking encounter. It makes a point not to answer every question you might have so as not to dilute and distract from the main focus of the story. And that twist in the final act genuinely blew my mind. Wow. I give Arrival a very high 9/10, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I was tempted to give it a full 10. Maybe on subsequent re-watches I'll have to come back and bump it up a bit. This is sci-fi at it's strongest, and I urge everyone to spare some time to go and see this. The big screen and top-notch surround sound of a cinema is absolutely the best way to watch this movie.",9,3,7,16 November 2016
The Big Short," A Mess That Knows Exactly What it Wants to Say
","The Big Short basically follows three sets of people as they capitalise on a fault in the banking system that no-one else can see. Dr. Michael Burry discovers it almost by accident and hatches an outlandish plan to earn his company a lot of money by betting against the housing market. The banks are more than happy to take all his money off him thinking they've made a lot of money very quickly, blind to the disaster that's about to befall them. Word spreads and a handful of entrepreneurial individuals dig a little deeper and decide to follow suit. This play makes everyone hugely unpopular amongst their peers and bosses, until the inevitable collapse of the global economy occurs in 2008.Somehow Adam McKay manages to treat this subject matter with as much humour as seriousness. He pokes fun at the financial industry, while simultaneously highlighting the very serious repercussions the collapse had on every day people. The three sets of people who bet against the housing market initially do so to stick their middle fingers up at the banks and earn a lot of money in the process, but by the end they find their success bittersweet. They've all become ridiculously wealthy, and the corrupt banks have fallen hard, but all at the cost of millions of people losing their jobs and their homes.Unfortunately this lends to a very uneven watch that can't decide on a tonal direction. It throws around technical jargon that any other financial thriller, knowing full well the average person has no idea, so handy definitions and analogies are provided. However these definitions are full of tongue-in-cheek jabs and off-kilter presentation. The first one of note, for example, they cut to Margot Robbie, as herself, enjoying a soak in a bubble bath as she explains Sub-Prime Loans. It's obviously played for laughs and irony, but it also cuts into the momentum of the movie, and acts as a sudden injection of comedy into an otherwise serious exchange. I have to applaud it though, the comedy at play in The Big Short is a lot deeper and more meaningful than just some jokes thrown into the dialogue (although there's a handful of those as well).On the flipside, it grapples with some pretty heavy character moments. Mark Baum is half- heartedly attending Anger Management classes as he tries to bottle up his emotions after the suicide of his brother. Once this Big Short idea is lain in his lap, he becomes a bit of a righteous crusader trying to open the banks' eyes, uncovering corruption and dodgy-dealing as he goes. When he 'wins' at the end, there's no sigh of relief or victory dance, there's just the crushing realisation that he's profited off the suffering of the poor by the banks' doing, becoming as bad as they were. Steve Carrell breezes through this progression masterfully. Christian Bale may be getting all the awards attention, but for me, Carrell was the shining star.That's not to understate Bale's Michael Burry though. Bale proves, again and again, that he's a heavyweight in the acting category. There doesn't seem to be anything he can't do. Here he plays Michael Burry as extremely socially awkward without hamming it up. He's a guy who prefers to be alone and shut the world out with metal music, but when he has to interact, he flubs and he stutters and is never quite sure of what to say. Also, Bale being Bale, the amount of preparation work he put into the role is admirable. He learnt drums and struggled through a knee injury just for the role.Ryan Gosling's Jared Vennert acts as facilitator to Mark Baum's role in the story. As far as character work goes, he gets the short end of the stick. His biggest job is to narrate the whole affair, which gives him the most comedy edge than anyone else. He's absolutely successful in that regard. Finally there's John Magaro as Charlie Geller and Finn Wittrock as Jamie Shipley who are budding traders struggling to get on the ladder, and enlist the help of the highly paranoid retired Wall Street trader Ben Rickert, played by Brad Pitt. Again Pitt doesn't get a whole lot to do, and Geller and Wittrock play characters driven more by naive ambition than a sense of doing the right thing. Although of course, they're hit with the consequences of everything by the end, when they walk into their dream trading room and it's empty and dead.The Big Short is a heavy watch. It's packed full of jargon and difficult and confusing concepts to get your head around (intentionally, by the banks). There's some great acting talent on display, bringing us deep and conflicted characters. It can feel a bit messy when it attempts to lighten the mood and maintain the audience's attention with humour, which doesn't particularly succeed, but the story it tells remains riveting. The whole movie acts as a satirical jab at the American finance industry and how, even after it's monumental f***-up, it's still ultimately working the same as it used to. I give The Big Short a very ambitious 8/10.",Null,0,0,2 February 2016
Wonder Woman," Proof that Women can make Superhero Movies too.
","Wonder Woman is an origin story, following Diana Prince as she grows up in Themyscira; an island hidden from the rest of humanity, and entirely inhabited by women known as the Amazons. The Amazons are a race of women placed on Earth by Zeus to instil love and hope into the hearts of mankind, but after a betrayal from Ares causes mankind to turn on itself, they secluded themselves from the outside world. Enter Steve Trevor who crash lands on the island during World War One, followed by his German pursuers, opening Diana's eyes to the outside world for the first time, and pitting her on a path to face Ares himself and stop the war to end all wars.As is becoming the running theme of the DCEU, and setting itself thematically apart from the MCU, Diana is a literal demi-goddess. Even at an early age she shows that she's more than just your regular Amazon. Even outside of Themyscira she shows that she's more than just a woman. She represents an ideal, she's a symbol of love and hope, and her quest to kill Ares is as symbolic as stopping the war itself - not just World War One, but all wars (of course, only to realise that that's just human nature).And yet Patty Jenkins very deliberately makes sure that this larger-than-life take on Wonder Woman doesn't run away with her. She grounds her and makes her relatable with a three-dimensional personality. Gal Gadot certainly lives up to the pressures the role demands of her. I was extremely skeptical of her casting (she wasn't even the best actor in the Fast & Furious franchise, which is saying a lot), and even BvS didn't really do enough to allay my fears. And yet here we are, and she is absolutely the best Wonder Woman we could have ever hoped for. She perfectly embodies Diana's charming naivety and innocence in this world that's completely new to her, and carefully ensures that Diana doesn't just appear dimwitted in the face of it all. Her reactions to seeing a baby and tasting ice cream for the first time are quintessentially endearing, and her complete disregard for societal expectations of women at the turn of the 20th century lends to a lot of comedy at humanity's expense rather than hers.Her relationship with Steve Trevor is also a big success of the movie, not shying away from the more romantic perspective of it, but also without making it a big focus. Gadot and Chris Pine share such a tantalising chemistry together that it makes Pine's unlikeliness to come back a real shame (the sequel is reportedly taking place in modern times, post-Justice League). Pine gives Trevor such a charming persona that its hard not to like him, even when he shows signs of an inflated ego. His interactions with Gadot's Diana are hugely entertaining to watch, whether they be for comedic, romantic, or dramatic purposes. Every line of dialogue between them feels natural and sticks the landing perfectly.Wonder Woman's visuals are a bit of a mixed bag across the board. There are some great visual treats to behold, particularly the recreation of Themyscira and Gadot's entire wardrobe department. Set-pieces and costumes are top-notch design work and all look great. However much of the CGI appears unfinished (and may explain Ares god-awful tin can appearance). Many of the backdrops in action sequences are green-screen, and it's plainly obvious, and many of the more outlandish stunts, as impressive as they are to watch, are almost entirely computer- generated. There's one moment early on when an Amazon dramatically swings down a cliff, but is shot by a German rifleman on the way down. It's great until she's hit by the bullet and suddenly it becomes obvious she was entirely computer-generated, with unnatural movements and reactions. The kicker is this sequence was completely unnecessary to CGI; they could've easily done it with a crane and stuntwoman instead, and kept far away from the uncanny valley being an issue.That said there are some bits of stuntwork that absolutely needed CGI to bring to life, and even without the fine tuning the effects needed, they still look hugely impressive. Wonder Woman is bristling with fantastic action sequences, the standout of which being her first big one as Wonder Woman, as she steps out into No Man's Land, takes everything the Germans have, and bursts through the trenches to get to a village on the other side, flipping tanks, demolishing church towers and liberating the village from it's German enslavers. Everything from the bullet-deflections, to her twirling and spinning in stylish choreography, to the brute force of tank-flipping looks great and is massively entertaining.Wonder Woman is not only the movie the DCEU needed, but also the movie Hollywood, and specifically big action blockbusters needed. It's strive for gender equality was pitch perfect, being as important behind the scenes as it was in front of the camera. It boasts the best Wonder Woman we could hope for, with a perfect performance from Gal Gadot and an equally as great performance from Chris Pine to bounce off. The action sequences are breathtaking and are certain to mark this movie out from the realm of superhero movies alone. But, and I must stress this, it's not perfect. It falters in the third act, Ares is a massive letdown of a beatstick (although the revelation of his identity is fantastic), and it doesn't give enough personality to it's lesser characters. I give Wonder Woman a high 8/10, letdown mostly by the awful presentation and appearance of Ares.",8,4,12,3 June 2017
Marriage Story," 90 Minute Build-Up to a Career Best Scene for Both Driver and Johansson
","An emotional drama about a divorce is not exactly the kind of plot I usually go for, but what immediately struck me about Marriage Story was the quintessential feeling Baumbach brings to all his films. He has an unparalleled talent in tapping into real life and writing dialogue that feels so incredibly natural and authentic that it makes it easy to forget you're watching a movie at all. We're immediately sucked into the life and relationship of Charlie and Nicole with a monologue each about they love about one another. This is probably the happiest and most uplifting the movie gets. As soon as we're dragged back to the marriage counselling, the bitterness starts to creep in and we're pushed down an ever-winding helter skelter. Once Nicole employs a ruthless lawyer to oversee the divorce, things between them get uglier than ever, and our preconceived notions of who they are and what they meant to each other degrades at a phenomenal speed.Almost all of Baumbach's films revolve around the concept of communication, or more accurately miscommunication, and Marriage Story is no different. It's fundamentally about a couple who couldn't clearly communicate their wants and needs to one another, and continue to miscommunicate in their break-up. They use lawyers as mouthpieces, saying things and asking for things they don't actually want. They remain polite and nice to each other, holding back their feelings, and letting it build to silent resentment. This all starts from the beginning, with Nicole refusing to read her love letter out to Charlie, and later taking his notes on the chin and bursting into tears as soon as she turns the corner.And this miscommunication builds and builds and builds in intensity until it has to explode, and it does so in full force right in front of the screen. The pivotal argument in Charlie's apartment single-handedly changed my opinion of this entire movie, and will be used from here on out as a display of how insanely talented both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are in front of the camera. All the truths between them are laid bare in a verbally violent altercation of the ages, in a single long shot. And yet neither Driver nor Johansson stutter or fall into caricature. They deliver their lines with equal intensity both rage and misery, and it's hard not to feel for both of them and what they've been through together and individually. So intense is the scene that I actually had to take a deep breath afterwards to compose myself. It's so viscerally raw and emotional to watch that I felt drained and overwhelmed by the time it was over.It goes without saying, but this film was a career best for both Driver and Johansson, each of them slipping into their roles so easily it felt like they were just playing themselves re-enacting difficult parts of their own lives. If I had to pick, Driver gave the best performance, if only because he was given more space to do so. By the movie's mid-point, we definitely spend more time with Charlie than we do Nicole, and Driver makes use of every second. The argument is definitely the high point, for both of them, but Johansson also gets her own monologue to Laura Dern's Nora which is just as emotionally stirring, while Driver gets a subdued but heavy rendition of 'Being Alive' from the musical 'Company', as well as a heartbreaking scene at the end when their son Henry finds the love letter Nicole wrote about him.As for complaints, in the lead-up to the argument, the movie was starting to lose me. I wasn't bored or finding it slow or dull, nor did I find any of the filmmaking aspects bad or hard to watch. But I found myself just getting so irrationally angry at the whole situation. From a purely factual standpoint, Charlie was the b*stard of the relationship. He was controlling and selfish, and a cheater on top of that. And yet putting Charlie front and centre for much of the movie just made me feel sorry for him. He was blindsided by the divorce, blindsided by Nora's ruthlessness, and blindsided by the financial cost it would have on him, all set on him by Nicole. It becomes very telling how semi-autobiographical this movie is of Baumbach's own divorce, acknowledging he was the cheater, but framing the story in such a way it lays most of the sympathy on his surrogate character, and the hardships Charlie has to go through at Nicole's behest. Putting Nicole behind the scenes for this portion of the movie, and essentially cutting out her side, really made her come off as the resentful b*tch putting Charlie through hell. The fact the movie makes a point that the blame can be laid on both sides almost makes this facet worse. If Nicole had just communicated her problems and desires more clearly and accurately, Charlie wouldn't have had to upend his life against his will and lose almost everything he earned. But I mean, as complaints go, I get the impression this was somewhat intentional on Baumbach's behalf. This was the point. He wants it to seem unfair, he wants it messy and his characters to both look terrible, he wants you angry at the system and how easily exploited it is at one party's loss.I have no hands-on experience with divorce, but I found way too much of it relatable. We saw our sons in Henry, and we saw each other in Charlie and Nicole, but if nothing else, this movie just strengthened our relationship, showing us how bad things can get if we don't communicate properly and compromise for one another. But it's not a movie I could watch again. It's a hard pill to swallow, and as electrifying as both Driver and Johansson are, it's not enough to endure all that rage and misery again. Currently I'm sitting on a solid 8/10, but that argument scene was so...so...intense that I'm going to give it a whole point to itself. I give Marriage Story a 9/10. I'd advise grabbing a box of tissues before you begin.",9,3,6,11 December 2019
The Wolverine," Wolverine finally gets the treatment he deserves!
","Finally we have a Wolverine movie to be proud of. I'm not even exaggerating when I say the X- Men franchise hasn't been this good in ten years. The beginning of First Class with Magneto going on his revenge binge was definitely one of the highlights of the franchise, but it was let down a little by the rest of the movie. The Wolverine is that first half hour of First Class stretched out to a full-length movie. It's darker, more serious, grounded, but without losing it's X-Men charm. It very much focuses on character and plot rather than squeezing in a million different mutants and action sequences, which altogether makes it hugely more enjoyable.One thing that will make every Wolverine fan very happy though is that it pushes the limits for it's certificate in the violence department. Wolverine's claws actually have blood on them after he stabs someone, and there's plenty of gruesome moments that happen just off screen (including slicing a man in half, and a character reaching inside their own chest). But it's not all off-screen. There's one particularly harrowing sequence at the film's climax that's sure to make you squirm, but I won't spoil it. The example I'll use instead is at the beginning when Wolverine saves Yashida from the Nagasaki bombing. We see Wolverine in all his glory burnt to a radiated crisp. It's a shocking thing to see, especially from this certificate. It seems the level of gore and violence in this movie is pitch perfect, showing just enough to push the boundaries and make a character who has metal claws in his knuckles believable, without going over the top with limbs and heads flying all over the place leaving fountains of blood.The plot was the biggest surprise for me though. Wolverine is haunted by the events of Last Stand, having nightmares of Jean Grey almost every night. His memory of her follows him wherever he goes and goes a way to dictate his decisions throughout the movie, and it gives him a very emotional edge that makes the character all the more sympathetic. On the verge of giving up, he's given the proposition of transferring his healing powers to the soldier he saved all those decades ago. He declines and what follows is a breakneck tale of family, of betrayal, of survival. He finds himself weak without his healing abilities, and the girl he's taken upon himself to protect seems to be the target of everyone, from the mob to the corporation, from a mutant who calls herself viper to an army of ninjas. Who's pulling the strings? What is everyone's agenda? Who are really the bad guys? It's a puzzle where the pieces all finally come together in a twist during the final climax that I guarantee you won't see coming.It's not without a couple of holes though, which is unfortunate and keeps it from rating higher. The most obvious of which is a few things are left unexplained. We learn what it is that takes Wolverine's healing powers, but we never learn how or why. We're introduced to the Silver Samurai in the closing moments, but why does it exist? To what end? Not even the twist that attempts to explain the Silver Samurai really does a particularly satisfactory job. Also Viper herself is still left a bit of an enigma by the end, which gives one the impression that she was added in just as another mutant in a distinctly mutant-less movie (Wolverine, Viper, and Yukio are the only mutants in the whole film).Finally the action scenes were pretty great, most of which comprising of hand-to-hand fighting. Pretty much any scene where Yukio fights is guaranteed to have you awing in wonder as she effortlessly flips and slides all over the place. She's obviously a graceful fighter with tuned agility and balance and it all shows off in the simply fantastic choreography. Wolverine's fight scenes on the other hand are much more brutish and muscled. He literally walks in the face of bullets and every beat and slice from his claws his felt. His first fight after he regains his healing abilities is suitably badass as he faces off against a samurai of sorts. He just takes all the stabs and cuts and then heals back up. He hardly throws a move until the finishing one. It's a fight that rings all the more victorious after the struggles he's endured for half the movie, feeling pain and exhaustion like a normal man would.The story is fantastic; complex enough to keep you on the edge your seat without being too in- depth and lead to confusion. The action is very well choreographed and shot well enough (it'll probably look better on a smaller screen where it's easier to take in the whole picture), and the effects and cinematography makes it a beautiful movie for the eyes. Finally the post-credits sequence. I won't spoil it but it is easily the best post-credits sequence ever, even surpassing Marvel's own post-credits scenes in their Avenger's pantheon. In fact it's worth the price of admission to see that one scene alone, and I was tempted to bump up the rating of the whole movie just for it. Alas that doesn't quite seem right, so I grant The Wolverine a very good 8/10. It's easily the best X-Men movie since X2 a decade ago.http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",8,9,17,31 July 2013
Black Panther," Black Panther is one of the most Stylistically Unique movies in the MCU
","Black Panther kicks off really promisingly with an animated/CGI prologue that establishes the history of Wakanda and why they're as secretive as they are, before jumping to 1992 in California and a conflict between King T'Chaka and his younger brother who's been placed as a spy in Oakland. This second prologue sets the stage for the ultimate T'Challa/Killmonger conflict that plays out later in the movie, but I'll admit it takes a while to get there. Instead Black Panther decides to build slowly, spending it's time on developing characters and world-building to establish the cultures and technologies of Wakanda, a previously unseen fictional country of the MCU.But honestly, I didn't mind the slower pace, because the world-building is so good. Wakanda is a nation built from five tribes, and each of them are drastically different from one another, with their own technologies, their own role in Wakandan society, and their own fashions and associated colours. T'Challa's tribe is the royal blood, the keepers of the Vibranium and the spiritual realm, including the spirit of the Black Panther that gives him his powers. There's a border tribe that lives on the outskirts of the country and keeps outsiders out. They appear more impoverished than the rest of the country, but of course it's only a front to save face. They live in huts, breed battle rhinos (you read that right), and have technology that revolves around shielding and defence. There's also the river tribe adorned in shells and turquoise colours, the sun tribe emblazoned in gold, and the outcast mountain tribe who cause a minor nuisance every chance they get.Honestly Black Panther's biggest strength is it's costuming/makeup and production design. There is no other movie that looks like Black Panther. It's aesthetic that marries traditional African designs and colours with wealthy/futuristic tech and architecture is unique. One of the River Tribe is a dapper-looking guy in a turquoise suit with traditional African lip plate, which is an equally bizarre and awesome aesthetic. General clothing is emblazoned in African patterns and colours with a modern stylising, and many characters show off tribal tattooing like facial scarification. Many walk around barefoot despite the obvious advancements in technology to be able to craft shoes and sandals (both of which T'Challa wears himself). The cityscape is full of futuristic skyscrapers topped off with African huts and buildings.But the traditional African aesthetic just stop there, it also leaks into the music, combining effortlessly with both modern Hip-Hop and your typical flavour of orchestral film score, sometimes all at the same time. I'm listening to the Kendrick Lamar-curated accompaniment album now and I'll admit I'm not digging it (although Pray For Me with The Weekend is pretty good), but the film's score is a different entity entirely. It makes a lot of use of African percussion, with the talking drum being instrumental in the film's audible identity, being used as both a main theme for the film, as well as providing some really good tension. As well as this there's often a typical hip-hop beat that comes in and out and instantly makes any and every scene it's used in feel inherently cooler and more badass. The orchestral element is, in typical Marvel fashion, still a little by-the-numbers at best, and just plain misused at worst. Even so Ludwig Goransson has crafted probably the most unique score Marvel have ever enjoyed (better even than Ragnarok, and Guardians doesn't count because that was all licensed).But I feel I've been focussing too much on the stylistic merits of Black Panther. They're undoubtedly the film's strongest suites, but that doesn't mean the rest of the film falls to the wayside. The story takes a while to pick up, it's true, but once it does it becomes full of political intrigue, and drives home it's message of worldwide responsibility. Killmonger is a fairly typical African-American who feels entitled by virtue of his skin colour, while ultimately not really understanding what his heritage means. He wants to use Wakandan tech to destabilise the world's governments and put Africans on the top of the world ladder for once. Meanwhile both Nakia and Shuri see the potential in Wakanda reaching out and providing aid to the countries that need it. While both viewpoints are stark opposites, they both revolve around Wakanda ditching its secretive nature and taking a more diplomatic standpoint on the world stage.Killmonger as a villain isn't too bad. While I wouldn't say he's a great villain in his own right, when compared to the rest of the Marvel villain roster, he's certainly one of the more developed ones. Wronged at a young age, he seeks to return to what he sees as his birthright. He has motivations and an intertwined history with T'Challa and the Wakandan royal family. I mean, compared to the likes of Malekith or Kaecilius, Killmonger is a breath of fresh air. Similar could be said of Andy Serkis' return as Ulysses Klaue, who is also not a particularly engaging villain in his own right, but Serkis just chews up the scenery (not only that, but beefed up with a tightly grown beard, and a waistcoat barely big enough to contain him, he's looks pretty badass).Chadwick Boseman gets almost the entire movie to flex his muscles as T'Challa, and manages really well to keep him the wise-beyond-his-years king. I'm not entirely convinced he can hold a whole movie himself though, as Black Panther was definitely kept afloat more by its supporting cast than by its lead. Luipta Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Winston Duke, and even Sterling K. Brown's small appearance all join together to give the movie an acting backbone to be proud of.Is Black Panther one of the best Marvel movies to date? I don't think so. It doesn't always hit the mark, and it's action sequences just become a blur of boring choreography, and its story is an interesting one, but feels a little diluted and probably too on-the-nose. From a stylistic viewpoint though, Black Panther not only stands out from the crowd of Marvel movies, but from blockbusters in general. I can't wait to see more of Wakanda in a few months come Infinity War. I give Black Panther a solid 8/10.",8,10,47,14 February 2018
Mother!," After Attempting to Explain it to Strangers, their Blank Expressions said it all
","On the surface, Mother! is a movie that meanders around for the first couple of acts, not really doing or saying a whole lot. Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with Him (Javier Bardem) alone in the country in a nice big house. She spends her time renovating the house, while He spends his time trying to find inspiration for his next great work. One day a stranger (Ed Harris) appears and He invites him in, much to Mother's annoyance. The next day the strangers wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) appears and starts causing trouble. Their squabbling children (Brian and Domnhall Gleeson) arrive, there's a murder, and more people start to invite themselves into the house. It escalates and escalates until it reaches the most bonkers, surrealist climax that lacks any logical or narrative sense. On the surface, Mother! is extremely hard to digest and understand, because on the surface, it literally makes no sense. The climax is without logic or realism.But Mother! is not a surface-level movie. It's not the straight-forward psychological thriller the marketing made it out to be. To explain requires MASSIVE SPOILER WARNINGS. The key to unlocking the mystery and surrealism of Mother!, to ensure that that bizarre climax makes any semblance of sense, is understanding who Mother and Him are; who they represent. Mother is mother nature, the binding lifeforce of the Earth. She maintains the house and attempts to turn it into the perfect paradise to live. He is God, the almighty, the biblical omnipotence, crafting works of words and relishing love and worship lain before him by his followers, who he invites into his world freely despite their destructive, corruptible nature. Once these keys are in place, it unlocks the rampant symbolism the movie is filled with. The stranger becomes Adam, the stranger's wife becomes Eve, their squabbling children become Cain and Abel, the secret room becomes hell, the broken sink becomes the great floods, his works become the old and new testament, Her baby becomes Jesus, the rave becomes Sodom and Gomorragh, the publisher (Kristen Wiig) becomes Islam, and even this feels like I'm just scratching the surface. There's so much in the movie to unpack and rearrange.But to truly tap into Mother!'s surrealist genius of concept and execution, you realise the biblical allegories aren't even the end of the themes and messages the movie attempts to convey. Every scene, every moment, every action by every character serves a symbolic purpose. One level deep it's a biblical narrative, from Genesis to Revelations. Go deeper still and you find themes relating to environmentalism, feminism, the creation of art, and abusive relationships.All that said, the third act is just completely bonkers. I can't even put into words how off-the-wall, batshit crazy the third act really is. It loses all sense of subtlety and narrative cohesiveness in favour of rampant, down-your-throat symbolism and metaphor. It completely spoils the surface-level enjoyment the movie could have enjoyed had it reigned it in a little bit and kept just a little more realistic. Instead we get Mother scrambling from room to room into ever-increasing amounts of WTF; from an open warzone in their living room, to cack-handed references to Global Warming, to women in cages being raped, to a full-on riot between anarchists and police.Even as I woke up this morning, Mother! managed to stick with me. I'm not even sure writing all this out has helped me to unpack what I witnessed last night, and I feel my opinion is mired by the experience still being a little too fresh. Aronofsky doesn't care if you cheer or boo his movies, as long as you do one or the other; as long as it causes enough of a rise in you that you feel compelled to tear it apart or applaud it, the movie is a success. Love it or hate it, there's no denying Mother! was successful in that regard. It is a movie that will not be forgotten any time soon. It has people talking about it and discussing it, and will continue to for quite some time.For me, I feel more positive towards it than I do negative. The allegory, particularly early on, is well-handled, and it's complex arrangements of multiple themes and messages surrounding this allegory is nothing short of genius. It's just a little let down by it's final act that throws narrative cohesion out the window, in favour of a montage of surreal situations seamlessly stitched together in an escalating fashion. It becomes a blunt force trauma to the head of symbolism that lacks subtlety or nuance. I wouldn't say it feels out-of-place because the whole movie builds up the sense of weird, right from the opening sequence of the burning house being restored, but I feel it didn't have to go full bananas - deliberately alienating mainstream audiences - to get it's point across. I give Mother! an imperfect 7/10.",7,4,11,19 September 2017
Casino Royale," How Bond Should've Been
","I've said it contains spoilers, but I'm not giving any plot twists or in-depth details away...I give Casino Royale a 9 out of 10. It wasn't the best film of 2006, but it was the best Bond film. Now, I know many will argue that the Bond films of the 60s were the best, or that Timothy Dalton was the best Bond, but Casino Royale is what Bond films should've been from the very beginning. When I was younger, I went out of my way to make sure I had seen all the Bond films past and future, and I enjoyed them thoroughly. However, I was younger, with younger eyes that are far more easily entertained and dazzled. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to see many Bond films in recent years with my more matured and film-budding eyes, but I did happen to catch Die Another Day a few months ago...I remember going to the cinema to see Die Another Day on it's first day of release and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We were the only people in there. I didn't think much of it then, but now I look back and think it must have been a sign. When re-watching Die Another Day a few months ago, I couldn't finish it. It was so ridiculous and cheesy. Pierce Brosnan seemed more like an ignorant creep rather than a ladies man, and always had something (un)humourous to say after he killed some bad guys. With my more seasoned eyes, it was a shambles that shamed my memory of all the Bond films previous.So I caught Casino Royale on a TV screening, just to see if they had done what I heard they had done in stripping it down and making it darker and grittier. Not only did they do that successfully, but they made a movie which could easily rival other movies of similar calibre. For once, there was in depth character development and a look into the Bond character beyond 'he's a super spy who blows stuff up and beds beautiful women just for fun'. Daniel Craig, and indeed the script, added more emotion to the character. He comforts those who get emotionally cut up by what he does, he gets knocked around and genuinely looks hurt. The Bond of Casino Royale isn't superhuman as Bond had been previously, but was more human than ever. He made mistakes and didn't always win. This is what makes Casino Royale the single best Bond film ever, and sets a precedence of what Bond films should always have been. Admittedly they sometimes got close, but never hit it on the head.There's also less emphasis on action. Don't worry, the action is still there, but it thrills the viewer in more ways than just explosions and and car chases. On that note, I can only recall seeing one explosion in the entire 2 and a half hour running time. The Poker game in particular was one of the most thrilling segment I've seen in any film, particularly of a segment so relatively slow.There is no Arch-villain who has some crazy plan for world domination and no side-kicks with diamonds in their face or over-large metal jaws. Instead it's an accountant with a problem with his eye that causes it to weep blood. Subtle, but ever much more darker and freakier than previous. On that note, this accountant also isn't a master of every fighting technique known to man. He is merely an accountant with a taste for gambling. In numerous parts of the film, it's strongly and explicitly shown that he isn't even the one running the show. Also, his exit is far less dramatic than any other villain in the past. Disappointing for some, but much more pleasing for those who like an air of believability. Lastly on the note of villains, there is no scene where Bond and the villain sit at a table while the villain unveils his plan and then swiftly orders the murder of Bond, no. Casino Royale makes this point in the very first scene as the villain behind the desk desperately tries to stall Bond with a proud look on his face, as he's rudely interrupted by a bullet to his head.There are no extraordinary gadgets. The only thing that comes close is a portable defibrillator, and even that could quite likely be possible to see in the car of a spy. There are no prevalent Bond girls and no near explicit sex scenes, and flirtatious one liners are turned into a smart and witty dialogue.All in all, this film is a quality film, with elements of action, romance, comedy and thriller, that just so happens to have a main character called James Bond. This is what Bond films should've been.",9,2,5,21 September 2009
Lucy," Substitues Sci-fi for Phi-fi.
","Honestly? I hadn't really given Lucy much thought. I had seen the trailer a long time ago and completely forgot about it, to the point where when it came out in America and topping the box office I was left thinking 'What film is this? I've never even heard of 'Lucy'.' I had, I just hadn't remembered the name. The trailer instantly piqued my interest with it's whole 10%-100% of the brain dealio. I don't care if it's scientifically accurate or not, if I wanted that I'd watch a documentary. Anyway the point is it's a theory that's always fascinated me. If we did only use 10% of our brains, the possibilities we could unlock at 100% are simply unimaginable. Limitless attempted the same theory, but was decidedly bland and inconsequential. Within the first few minutes, Lucy had surpassed Limitless, and maintained it's quality throughout.Lucy, more than anything, is a philosophical sci-fi movie. It's not about the science, it's about the unimaginable. So yeah, it can get a bit unbelievable when she starts throwing people across the room with telekinesis, but it's the natural path to her destination, which is philosophical in nature and certain to spark debate. The movie, especially early on, is peppered with seemingly out-of-place shots of the order of nature. The scene of various animals getting jiggy with it even made the immature teenagers behind me annoyingly burst into fits of giggles. For me though? It added an extra dimension and weight to the overall themes of the movie. What is life? What's it's goal? Where are we, as a species, heading? The opening lines 'We've been evolving on this planet for a billion years, and what have we done with it?' speaks volumes.Another key theme of Lucy is that of humanity and how it relates to the natural order of things. We are the only animals with self-awareness, and by extension a sense of morals. Most movies take the human side by appealing to our humanity and highlighting that it's what makes us unique. Lucy doesn't quash that approach. Instead it suggests an alternate viewpoint; that our humanity is what's holding us back and disrupting the natural order of things. The more knowledge and clarity Lucy gains, the more she becomes disconnected from her humanity; from her emotions. She doesn't feel sad or afraid, she doesn't even feel pain. They're all things that get in her way of reaching 100% brain capacity.However, this is still a Luc Besson movie, and Luc Besson likes his action scenes. Amidst all the philosophical ideas batting around, we get a lot of what feels like superfluous scenes that don't really add much. And it's true. They don't add much to the themes and ideas at all. They're pretty much put there to quicken up the pace a bit, provide some light entertainment, and to further the plot along, because the movie does still have a plot believe it or not, but I'll get to that in a minute. The more superficial scenes are very well done, as Besson is known for. Who knew a chase through Paris involving only one car could be so hugely entertaining (if a bit over-the-top; cars flipping and smashing into each other all over the place, in the middle of a busy city)? There's also quite a bit of tension early on. The introduction of Mr Jang near the beginning is surprisingly scary, as you can't help but imagine yourself in Lucy's shoes.The plot is reasonably simplistic. Lucy unwittingly becomes a smuggler of a new drug being put into the market, but a bit of mistreatment along the way results in her suffering a massive overdose of the drug giving her an explosion of cell development (thus the whole brain capacity theory). She escapes and goes on a rampage to recover the other packets of this new drug to keep her mental growth sustained. Feeling lost and confused, she also contacts a scientist who's been researching the theory for decades. Naturally everything comes colliding together in an epic climax worthy of comparison to 2001's Starchild.Scarlett Johansson isn't going to win any Oscars for her emotionless performance, but it deserves commendation nonetheless. Now, I've never been a particularly big Johansson fan. I've always found her to be just a pretty, slutty face adding little to no weight to her roles. Lucy is only the second time I've been genuinely impressed by her work (the first time being Black Widow's manipulation of Loki in Avengers). She starts the film as a bit of a bimbo. Not in a cartoony kind of way as is often portrayed, but she definitely makes a point to make this more human Lucy stand-out from her more cold and efficient Lucy later on. Also, while her performance is fittingly emotionless (as is the point), she does manage to bring a lot of weight to the character. The stand-out example here is with her phonecall to her mother, as she relives memories and experiences she shouldn't remember, like a cat she had when she was barely a year old, or suckling on her mother's teet (yeah, that got the teenagers behind me giggling as well). I wouldn't go so far as to call it a heart-wrenching scene, but it added to Lucy's character development almost purely thanks to the emotion Johansson managed to get across. Again, you couldn't help but empathise.Lucy has been getting a lot of hate, and honestly I can't understand why. It's got a good balance of action and plot, and themes and philosophy. It's 2014's intelligent blockbuster. It's got a little bit for everyone, from a car chase through the busy streets of Paris to the mind-boggling finale, from the tense introduction of the antagonist to the emotional phone-call. Maybe people are just taking the pseudoscience too literally? I didn't and instead I saw the deeper meaning quite unsubtly placed beneath the surface.",9,12,26,26 August 2014
Godzilla," The Best Monster movie since Jurassic Park
","This is a lot more character-driven than you might go in expecting. Godzilla does not take centre stage here, which becomes evident in the action scenes where our focus is deliberately shifted away from the giant lizard. This is my only real complaint, but it's a pretty damaging one. Putting the focus on the characters is one thing, but taking us away from the reason we're sat in the cinema in the first place isn't exactly a good idea. It's not always obnoxious, but on multiple occasions the MUTO will come in for the kill and Godzilla will attack back, and then the camera will swing round and follow the humans instead. It's frustrating.Thanks to it's character focus, the plot is a bit of a slow burn. We get a rather long flashback to fifteen years ago to set-up the movie with a mining operation that goes wrong and reveals a rather large skeleton, and an open pod that leads into the ocean. Nearby in Japan, an engineer at a Nuclear Power Plant is concerned about some of the readings he's getting, but it's too late and the area is quarantined. This takes up a good quarter of the movie or so, and still takes a bit to pick up after that. The engineer is still obsessed with what caused the disaster and suspects a conspiracy. He takes his son back just in time for the birth of the MUTO. From this point on, I wouldn't say it was all steam ahead, but it builds and builds and never lets up until the very end. We're taken on a goose chase across the pacific culminating in the big climax in San Francisco.For a character-driven story, I've got to be honest, there isn't a whole lot of meat to the characters. There's quite a lot of them to juggle and so there's only enough time to establish the core attributes of those characters; the obsessed engineer, the estranged son, the scientists who've been tracking it for fifteen years, the concerned wife. There isn't much else to them. However the focus on these characters does keep the movie grounded. It gives us faces to relate to. When the name of the game is suspense, you need characters to focus on, and Godzilla utilises that to it's fullest.Thankfully for all the two-dimensional characters, the acting quality is sky-high. Bryan Cranston absolutely owns his role. Not going to lie, he moved me on an emotional level right at the very beginning before much had even been established. It was his performance that made me feel sad for his character. Unfortunately, while he was prominent in the marketing of the film, he's definitely not the lead. By the second third of the movie, he's completely absent. More Bryan Cranston wouldn't have gone amiss. The other great stand-out is Elisabeth Olsen. She gets even less of a character than Cranston, playing the wife and mother who's constantly worrying about her husband. However she has that special factor that makes the lacking character lift off the screen and feel like a real person. Again, more of her wouldn't have gone amiss. The rest of the cast did their dues. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the real lead and his performance is pretty good. It is however overshadowed by everyone else. He's the fairly typical hero, willing to do anything to save his family and his country, and thrust into everything by chance and coincidence more than anything. Ken Watanabe is brilliant as one of the scientists, as is Sally Hawkins as the other scientist. Again, not much to do, but they make their characters feel like real people, and that's what's important.The effects are unsurprisingly amazing. Gareth Edwards, director of the fantastic Monsters, pretty much got his dream job here, directing a big blockbuster monster movie. He relishes in it. Godzilla never looked this good, harking back to the original bulky design, but of course with a lot more movement and detail. Watching him rise up against the dark cityscapes is an absolute beauty to behold; every other frame could be a piece to put on your wall. My only complaint here is that the MUTOs look a little odd due to a lack of tail. All they needed was a tail to balance them out a bit and they'd look killer, but as they are they look more like aliens than subterranean creatures.But you know what makes me happiest about Godzilla? You remember that teaser trailer I mentioned? It's here, untouched. The first half with the skydivers to the sound of 'Kyrie' through these beautiful skyscapes is right there in the movie. That teaser sets the tone of the movie absolutely perfectly, because it's ripped directly from the movie, soundtrack and all. It's so tense and suspenseful from as soon as the MUTO is born in the first third, and the music goes a long way in creating that tense atmosphere. My only complaint with the soundtrack is one particular scene right at the very end where it goes into cliché mode. Eurgh.Godzilla is, hands down, the best monster movie since Jurassic Park over twenty years ago. It's gritty and realistic, it's full of suspense that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, and a particular focus on the human element keeps it grounded amidst all the giant monsters. It's not perfect though, with underdeveloped characters and a frustrating tendency to not show the best bits. I give Godzilla a very good, and thoroughly recommended, 8/10.http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",9,7,18,16 May 2014
Deadpool," Deadpool is the movie we were desperately asking for
","Ryan Reynolds is back in the one role he was meant to play all this time. I cannot state enough the positive impression he made in the otherwise awful Origins movie, despite his extremely limited screen time. He was just perfect for it, unbelievably perfect for it. I never imagined there would be any semblance of a meaningful romance or emotion, and yet here it is. Somehow through Wade and Vanessa's sex scene montage through the year's holidays, you get a real sense of two people loving each other. Even at it's most gratuitous, the sex in Deadpool is more soulful than the vast majority of other movies, even if it's not particularly romantic sex. When they find out about Wade's illness as well, there is a little exchange that genuinely broke my heart (by exchange, I mean he narrates over it, but it's hugely telling).Unconventional storytelling, surprisingly relatable romance, check and check. Two things I never expected to find in a Deadpool movie. But what about what I did expect? Humour. I expected a lot of humour. You know what I got? I got a lot of humour. I don't watch a huge amount of trailers, and rarely ever more than one per movie, but while many studios like to parade the best jokes in the trailers, Deadpool managed to get away with just teasing the worst ones. There's a whole lot more in the movie, and they're a whole lot better too. Yes, it's very crude. Very, very crude. And yet it's more than just laughing at dicks because dicks are funny hurr hurr hurr. There's some genuine wit and thought put into these jokes. It's far from the only source of laughs as well. Some of the biggest laughs it got out of me were from it's self-awareness. The movie knows what it is, knows what it's a part of, and pokes a lot of fun at it. There's a number of jokes poking fun at the Origins movie, the X-Men, Wolverine himself, but also Hugh Jackman, the fact Xavier has been played by two actors, Reynold's stint as Green Lantern. It's hugely aware not only of the universe Deadpool resides in, but also the universe in which the movie resides. It's inescapable with Deadpool's trademark of breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience directly ('Breaking the fourth wall inside a fourth wall? That's like...sixteen walls!').The other thing you expect from Deadpool is gore. Completely over-the-top, gratuitous gore. Deadpool certainly does not shy away from blood and gruesomeness. It's the blood-splatting R- rated affair everyone hoped and dreamed of for all this time. And yet, I can understand why, on the gore front at least, it didn't get a full-blown 18 on this side of the pond. It's definitely no Tarantino flick. There's beheadings, broken bones, headshots, as well as Wade's own gruesome transformation, but there's no spraying of blood, or guts hanging over the floor, or any of that kind of gore you'd expect in a Saw movie. In fact, when it does get bad, Deadpool tells the camera to look away, leaving only the power of suggestion to fill in the blanks. Is it a gory movie? Yes. Is it gratuitous? I wouldn't say so, no.Finally I'll just touch on the acting a moment. Mainly to lay unbridled praise upon Ryan Reynolds shoulders. He has been completely dedicated to making sure this movie happens, and that he remains in the role. His small appearance in Origins as Wade Wilson was probably his best performance, and he's managed to tap into it again effortlessly for Deadpool. He's just an effortlessly funny guy. The jokes come tumbling from his mouth as if he's spitting them out, one after the other. He never stutters or stumbles. The only downside to Deadpool is that he has a mask over his face, so his facial expressions get lost, but let's be honest, that was never Reynold's strong point. The supporting cast are pretty great as well, especially Morena Baccarin as Wade's girlfriend Vanessa. They share perfect chemistry together, and she never drifts into damsel in distress mode. So there we go. After all these years, Deadpool finally got his own movie, and he was actually done justice. It's gory, it's crude, and it's completely hilarious. I am so glad that I was wrong about this movie (although, no matter how bad the previews made it look, I would still have watched it either way). I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes dark or crude humour, or superhero flicks, but I would definitely not recommend it to anyone under the age of fifteen. Blood, crude language, and full nudity are commonplace. I mean like seriously, why do I feel I have to write that? If it's a 15, you shouldn't have to ask whether it's appropriate for a twelve year old, the answer is obviously no, otherwise it wouldn't be a 15. Anyway, I give Deadpool a very good 8/10. Bring on the sequel.",8,5,16,12 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Bloody Hilarious and Hilariously Bloody
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is literally the lovechild of classic James Bond and Matthew Vaughn's own Kick-Ass. It's about a super secret agency that sends spies around the world to take down eccentric and bizarre supervillains that live in mountain bases. They have lighter grenades, umbrella guns, and poison-tipped knives in their shoes, but above all they're also suave, upper class toffs. It's James Bond all over again. However, add in the swearing, blood and ultra-violence, truck-load of black humour, and copious amounts of pop culture references and self-mocking tone from Kick-Ass and you get Kingsman.The kind of comedy you get here is very dark. If you don't find violence or gore funny, you won't be laughing much. Whether it's the amputee with swords for legs, or implants that cause heads to explode into colourful fireworks, there's plenty to go around. To be honest, I was actually taken quite aback by it all. I know it's Matthew Vaughn (and a 15), but I never expected it to be quite so bold and unapologetic. I mean the opening lines are 'Oh s***, we f***ed up.' And not long after, a guy is cleaved in half. It's unrelenting as the movie goes on as well.There is a little bit of wit on display as well though. It's not all about the violence. There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek references that almost break the fourth wall, like the recurring line 'It's not that kind of movie.' And Eggsy's choice of dog name being representative of three of the biggest spies in pop culture (JB is the dog's name, and he's asked whether it's after James Bond, Jason Bourne, or Jack Bauer).If there was particularly a weak point in the movie, it would probably be the CGI. In this day and age there's really no excuse for bad CGI. The opening titles are done in a really imaginative and integrated way, but the CGI used to do it looks really obvious. There's explosions from a brick building, and the bricks crumble, tumble and form into the words of the titles. Then the camera zooms into one of the windows. Unfortunately this scene is rife with CGI that looks like it was rendered in the 90s and just looks plain awful. There's no real effort to try and make the bricks blend in with the rest of the wall at all, and the way they tumble down and form into the words reeks of a cheap video game. It gets better later on, but for an opening, it doesn't leave a particularly good impression.The other thing that didn't really rub right for me was the split personality of the film. Kick-Ass managed to hit a happy medium between being over-the-top and being grounded. It was horrifically good fun, but also tugged on the heartstrings and always felt completely natural. Kingsman on the other hand, you can tell they've aimed for the same kind of thing, but the mix just doesn't sit right. It's got the language and violence for adults, but the core of the movie feels like Spy Kids. It's over-the-top in the wrong kind of way, which is the point; it's to make fun of those classic spy films, but it just didn't mix particularly well in my opinion. It would be lighthearted, then super violent, then serious and dramatic, and there was no real transition to ease us into the new feel. It didn't ruin the movie by any means, don't get me wrong, it just prevented it from quite being the masterpiece Kick-Ass was.Kingsman is certainly a very fun movie, full of lots of great actors, old and new alike. It's brave and unapologetic in it's mockery and depiction of violence, and that makes it an extremely entertaining watch, despite it's faults. It's bloody hilarious, and hilariously bloody. I give Kingsman an enjoyable 7/10, and would definitely recommend it to those that enjoy ultra- violence depicted in a lighthearted manner.",7,2,9,3 February 2015
Green Book," Half Buddy Comedy, Half Racial Drama
","Green Book is based on the true story friendship of Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga. The former was a highly regarded black musician, praised for his virtuosity, and the latter a struggling family man trying to keep food on his family's table. They were an unlikely pair, and yet over the course of a two month tour of the deep south, they forged a friendship that lasted fifty years until their deaths within months of each other. It's not exactly a headline-making story, but it's one ripe for telling to warm the cockles.Half buddy comedy, half racial drama, the meat of the film is watching these two character interact as they travel from city to city. As far as narrative pacing goes, this is probably where my only criticism lies. It's two hours of traveling montage - dramatic interaction over race - traveling montage - dramatic interaction over race - traveling montage - and so on and so forth. While each interaction is different, and each character is fleshed out more as their kinship develops, it still somehow comes off as a little repetitive once you reach the end of the second act. Thankfully the interactions are so good, either from the drama they invoke, or from the subtle comedy, that it chugs along quite pleasantly regardless.Mahershala Ali plays Shirley with a delicate finesse that instantly places him beyond the realms of racial stereotypes. As he later shouts through tears later on in the film - in possibly one of the film's most powerful moments - he's not black enough to be black, but not white enough to be white. He lives a life simultaneously praised and downtrodden on by white people. They want him to come and entertain them, but won't let him use their toilets, or eat in their restaurant. On the stage he earns every ounce of praise, shedding his skin colour entirely, but once he comes off he's just another black man. But not even the black community will accept him. In the most poignant of scenes that displays this, the car overheats and Tony gets out to cool it off and top up the water. Shirley gets out in front of a field being plowed by a group of black people - staged somewhat reminiscent of slavery - dressed to the nines in his expensive suit. The looks he gets rightly makes him feel uncomfortable. Ultimately his unwelcomed existence leads to heaps of loneliness.But for me the film was all on Viggo Mortensen as Tony Vallelonga (or Tony Lip as he's affectionately called). While Shirley finds a friend at the end, and a sense of belonging, Tony finds more as his previous worldview is almost entirely shattered by spending real time with a black man for the first time in his life. At the beginning, he bins two glasses used by black plumbers, while the rest of his family sit there minding the place suspiciously, giving off a racist atmosphere. In truth, Tony starts out as a not particularly likeable guy, and yet you can't help but get behind his charm. He's manipulative, brash, violent, and lacks manners, but he's also entertaining, charming, and loving to his wife and family. As the film goes on, as the friendship develops between him and Shirley, and as he becomes a little less racist as the runtime goes on, he becomes an altogether softer character who's learned lessons of dignity along the way.Of course from some perspectives one intrinsic problem with the film is how Tony is hailed as a white saviour, and on that point I can't really disagree. Shirley would've been useless without Tony standing up for him (apart from in one instance where this gets them both locked up in jail, and Shirley has to get them out with a particularly important phonecall). Yet at the same time I can't help but feel this is more down to the nature of the two character's personalities rather than their skin colour. Tony is hired as a driver and bodyguard because he's a big guy who can take a punch, and displays a rare loyalty to his charge. Of course he's going to be the saviour, that's what he was employed to do. Shirley on the other hand is a softer pedigree of person. He values personal hygiene far higher than most, he's pampered by his butler, he lives a secluded life by himself without any real knowledge of how the world around him works. He's the type of character, black or not, that needs someone to stand up for him in difficult situations.Finally on the note of historical accuracy; who cares? This isn't a documentary. I swear I see this about every true story adaptation, but it's a movie for entertainment, that bends the truth in order to get it's point across, and create moments of drama or humour that will enthral it's audience. It's not a blow-by-blow account of Shirley and Tony's roadtrip during those two months. It may not even be entirely truthful to the characters of the real men, but as a movie it just works. It makes you happy, it makes you sad, and ties it's characters and themes together creating one cohesive story.Green Book was definitely a very enjoyable movie. It was far funnier than I ever expected, and that was something pleasantly surprising. Every interaction between Shirley and Tony feels natural, and the chemistry shared between Mortensen and Ali is fantastic to watch. Whether they're butting heads ideologically or comedically, or coming around to the other's viewpoints, you can't help but root for both of them and the budding friendship. I give Green Book a solid 8/10. I certainly wouldn't be disappointed if it won Best Picture.",8,1,1,5 February 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Simultaneously Satisfying and Disappointing
","I find myself simultaneously satisfied and disappointed with Chapter 2. What really stuck out to me, beyond the exquisite fight scenes, of the first movie was it's emotional core. It's unfair to expect Chapter 2 to hold quite as much emotional level, and it didn't, but it didn't really substitute it with anything nearly as good. The film opens with Wick tying up the last loose end from the first movie and returning home, only to be served a mandatory IOU that leads him deeper into the mysterious underworld of assassins and hit men. We see how far this world extends, including a Continental in Rome, and the influence of assassins extending from rich higher-ups all the way down to buskers on the street. It did get to the point where I wondered if there was actually anyone in this fictional universe who wasn't an assassin. But at least they didn't just resort to a re-hash of the first movie (even though that's where I thought it was heading initially).But while the plot was a little unsatisfactory, choosing instead to embrace it's cheesier mythology, the action sequences remain as tight and gritty as ever. One might argue that they're actually a step-up from the first film, that was mired in a limited budget. Chapter 2 having more money to play around with allowed the filmmakers more creativity in their stuntwork. There's a few stand-out moments, including a covert shoot-out across a bridge that passer's-by don't notice, knife fights in what amounts to a hall of mirrors, and even using cars as weapons (although I did wonder how anyone could stand up and fight after the amount of times Wick got run-over). We even get to see how John Wick managed to kill three men in a bar with a pencil.That said, the sheer creativity used in the fight sequences are balanced out by a lot of more mundane stuntwork that drags on a little too long. Pretty much any time Wick and Cassian come head-to-head, their fights go on too long and the admittedly impressive choreography just becomes a blur. Likewise, Wick finds himself battling through endless swathes of goons on multiple occasions. Why all these goons are so stupid and/or inaccurate is beyond me, and they just keep coming and feeding the machine that is whatever weapon Wick is wielding at the time. Even fellow assassins on the street fall victim to just being headshot fodder. Longer and bigger is not always better.Visually though, Chapter 2 is a massive step-up from it's predecessor. The increase in budget also allowed for some simply fantastic cinematography and creative uses of backdrop and setting. Almost every scene is complimented by interesting lighting that gives it an artistic-looking edge, and even composition and framing are used to good effect to create the most visually pleasing imagery. For example, there's a shot of Santino in an art gallery dead centre, with statues either side of him literally framing him in the shot. Mirrors and windows are also used to great effect, with a bright and vibrant array of colours splashed on to them, creating interesting visual effects not too dissimilar to those in Blade Runner and Skyfall. This is the cinematographer of Crimson Peak and Silent Hill at his best.Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard return to score the movie, with the same kind of frantic electro-rock. Every scene is driven by a drum beat, either natural drums or electronic, with dance basslines and the odd distorted guitar providing the musical backbone. Marylin Manson's Killing Strangers, which acted as the first movie's main theme, is absent entirely (much to my disappointment), but Nostalghia provide a good substitute with their odd brand of atmospheric techno, and Le Castle Vania provides another typically clubhouse tune for Chapter 2's own version of the club shootout. Finally a note for the sound department; Chapter 2 is very, very loud, with sharp difference between action volume and dialogue volume. Not sure if it was just my cinema screening, but they had it turned up so loud that the action sequences (most noticeably with the opening car chase) just became a distorted mess. I was starting to think I should've brought earplugs.Even after having written all of that out, I'm still torn on what I actually thought of it. It absolutely did not live up to the sheer excellence and creativity of the first film, but I never really expected it would any way. The fight scenes are exceptionally well choreographed, balancing style with practicality in a way rarely seen before, show signs of originality in how they're presented, and are filmed with such a fantastic eye for photography that every scene is wall-mountable. However a lot of the gunfights and knifefights go on too long, fall back on filler, and the deeper dive into the assassin mythology is more cheesy and OTT than engaging and interesting. I give John Wick: Chapter 2 a 7/10.",7,1,4,22 February 2017
Annihilation," I Don't Know
","Annihilation follows Lena, in the midst of grief from losing her husband a year ago. She's cut herself off from friends and co-workers and leads a sad existence. That is until her husband appears in her bedroom, with no idea how he got there, and appearing distant and vacant. They're both taken to a lab where Lena is introduced to The Shimmer, a bizarre optical film that's enveloped itself around a large region of swampland, originating from a lighthouse. No-one knows what caused it, or indeed what's going on inside. It could be extraterrestrial, metaphysical, or even religious, and every team and probe that has been sent inside has never been seen from again, until Kane. It's not long before Lena and a team of women enter The Shimmer to find out for themselves.What they're greeted with, after the initial lapse of time in their memories, is a place not too dissimilar to what you'd expect, initially. As they travel further in they find specimens that should not be possible, like multiple species of flowers growing on the same plant, and animals with unusual mutations like crocodiles with shark teeth. It wasn't long before I came to the conclusion that this was definitely a movie I wish I saw in the cinema, as the film's visual identity was uniquely beautiful and nightmarish in equal measure. The use of visual effects and camera trickery creates a world within The Shimmer that truly feels dreamlike. Every scene inside is augmented with an almost oily appearance from the refractured light. The further they travel inward, the more bizarre and crazy the mutations get, like trees made of glass, and plants shaped like people, and the combination of CGI and production design exquisitely brings it all to life.But there's a lot more to Annihilation than it's visual achievements. This isn't just a movie where our characters travel deeper into more bizarre lands, face some unstoppable antagonist, and then get the hell out of dodge. Instead Annihilation poses questions with no answers, and layers metaphors over symbolism. Dig a little deeper beneath the surface and you find a wealth of themes rarely touched upon in such an imaginative and creative way. Ultimately Annihilation is a film about self-destruction through evolution. Some of the opening lines of dialogue are about the nature of cancer cells, which is a motif that recurs throughout the film. What's inside The Shimmer is a cancerous, self-destructive nature that's chaotic without being inherently evil. It is both a dream and a nightmare, both beautiful and horrible. I wish I could delve deeper in this review, but I really don't want to spoil anything. There's so many layers to this that I could talk about it for paragraphs and paragraphs.The third act kicks it up even further, dialing the bizarre up to eleven and delving into the psychedelic leanings of 2001. It manages to effortlessly evolve the themes of self-destruction and chaotic nature into themes of identity. What does it mean to be you? What really defines who you are? We as people are constantly evolving and changing, both physically and mentally. You are not the same person you were yesterday, and the person you'll be tomorrow is not the person you are right now, and yet we are still us. At what point do we stop being us? Or conversely, at what point does someone (or something) else become us? Is it possible to become someone else? And like a cancer, the ideas get ingrained and you can't shift them no matter how hard you try.In this utterly peculiar movie I also want to point out the score, which is an atmospheric cacophony of soundscapes and motifs that would make the late Johann Johannsson proud. It weaves in a peaceful, calming acoustic guitar motif in with a nightmarish soundscape of synths and noises, and the sounds of the climax are so alien to the ears that they truly enhance what's going on on the screen in a way no other films have ever achieved. So bizarre are the sounds that I can't even describe what they sound like, or how they were made, but they somehow manage to remain oddly melodic as well. There's also some exquisite use of sound design throughout, creating an atmosphere inside The Shimmer that's truly unsettling. There's one scene in particular that is one of the most terrifying moments I've seen outside of full-on horror movies, and it's all thanks to the haunting sound design that turns what's already quite a scary creature into pure nightmare fuel.On the note of nightmare fuel, Annihilation has no shortage. There's a surprising amount of gore and body horror on display here, from a guys gut being cut open to reveal weaving intestines like snakes or worms, to plants growing from scars, skeletons methodically placed in sand almost ritualistically, to a corpse torn apart from mould and moss unlike any other. If the sound design doesn't thoroughly creep you out, the body horror certainly will.Annihilation is not for everyone, I can fully understand that, but it is absolutely for me. It's about as weird as film can get, unsettling and dark, with subtext both deep and extremely well developed. It's narrative is tightly paced, weaving together its themes in a such way that is impressively seamless. It's a film that sticks with you for a multitude of reasons, making it yet another overwhelming success for Garland from an artistic viewpoint. I give Annihilation a resounding 9/10. Watch it. Absolutely watch it. I just wish I could watch it in the cinema.",9,8,18,12 March 2018
Spectre," Not the Grand Overarching climax I was hoping for
","Spectre sits firmly in the middle of the four movies in the Craig era. It's not better than Skyfall, but it is better than Quantum. In any regards it's your typical Bond storyline. The lovable rogue he is disobeys orders following up on a personal lead, resulting in him having to work in the shadows without back-up. He meets some attractive young women, whom he beds, unravels the mystery surrounding him, and confronts the big, dastardly villain. There's big set-pieces, impressive explosions, and backdrops that span the globe from deserts to snowy mountainsides.One of the big things though was Spectre's link to Casino, Quantum, and Skyfall. This was probably what I was looking forward to most; the idea that the last three Bond movies were episodic and building up to a massive conclusion. In some ways it's exactly what I wanted, in other ways, not so much. All the three previous movies are referenced and mentioned multiple times throughout, implying some grand plot weave planned out well in advance (or at least cleverly retrospective). Le Chiffre, Silva, and the deaths of M and Vesper are key talking points. Mr White (from the end of Casino and beginning of Quantum) makes a pivotal cameo, yet Greene is largely forgotten (he's mentioned in passing once, probably for the best). We even get a nice speech from Oberhauser about how he was behind everything that has vexed Bond over the last nine years. Things is, I'm still left wondering exactly what the connection was. The action was largely unmemorable, unfortunately. We get a fantastic hand-to-hand fight between Bond and the Jaws-like Hinx, and the race through the old MI6 building was thrilling and intense. However the car chase was possibly the dullest car chase I've ever seen. It's literally just Bond driving around Rome in an Aston Martin prototype while an equally as expensive supercar tails him. There's no interesting manoeuvres or suspenseful obstacles (beyond a Fiat 500 slowing both cars down to a crawl...yawn). Then there was the chase between a convoy of jeeps down a snowy mountain, and Bond in a plane, where they basically play an extended game of chicken. And after the thrilling chase through the old MI6 building, the villain is thwarted by a single bullet (after a number of attempts) taking his helicopter down. That's not to say Spectre is completely unmemorable and disappointing. The opening scene in Mexico City is one of the first longshots to feature in a Bond movie, and it's a damn good one at that; placed in the middle of Mexico's Day of the Dead celebrations, and it all culminates with considerable property damage and a very public helicopter display. Then there's Oberhauser's introduction at the Spectre meeting, as he sits in complete silhouette the whole time, and Hinx makes his mark as a replacement hit-man. And of course the torture scene that looks like Bond's most painful endurance since the ball-busting of Casino. And of course, no matter how obvious it was, it was still great seeing Oberhauser's identity get revealed. If Craig really does leave after this movie, which looks more and more likely, the biggest loss will be not seeing Oberhauser again.On which note I'll talk about the acting, which is yet another mixed bag. Craig is still on top form as Bond. It's obvious from interviews that he's bored of it and wants to do something else, but this isn't apparent in the movie. He's still the suave yet aged spy out to save the world (or as is the case more recently, himself). Christoph Waltz brings his usual villain typecast to Oberhauser and it's actually perfect. I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to bring this iconic villain into the modern Bond era, even if it does feel like Hans Landa lite. Ben Whishaw is also, once again, a scene stealer as Bond's Quartermaster, providing much of the light-hearted, nerdy charm.But then we get to the mixed bag; Monica Bellucci is spectacular. She oozes sexual tension and her and Craig shared a fantastic chemistry between them. Unfortunately she only features for about five minutes near the beginning and is never seen again, marking her claim as the oldest Bond girl a bit of a let down; she's severely under-utilised. Instead we get Lea Seydoux as Madeline Swann for the bulk of the movie, despite only being introduced halfway through. She's very much the more typical Bond girl; young and curvaceous with an independent streak that defies Bond's charms for all of about two minutes before falling head-over-heels in love with him. Could've worked if she and Craig had any chemistry at all. No matter how much they wanted her to be; she was no Vesper.Spectre was not the grand climax to the Craig-era I was hoping for. It felt like just another instalment in the Bond machine; only loosely connected despite it's incessant references and mentions. The big twist was pretty obvious a year ago, and the personal rattling of Bond was ill- felt, if felt at all. It has it's saving graces in a couple of memorable scenes, and a couple of brilliant performances, and I mean, at least it tried to do something different in the franchise by attempting a shared universe amalgamation, even if it didn't pay off as I'd have liked. For a Bond movie, it's still creme de la creme, and Sam Mendes proves that he can add that special little sparkle that just makes it feel special. Part of me hopes Craig will have another stab, and Waltz will return to offer the big climax Spectre promised to be, but part of me thinks that it wrapped everything up and there's no more to tell anyway. I give Spectre a very good, albeit disappointing, 8/10.",8,13,36,27 October 2015
The Nice Guys," A Laugh Out Loud Comedy
","The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy, except instead of cops, they're a private investigator and a contract tough guy who find themselves both looking for the same girl, who's gotten herself wrapped up in political and pornographic intrigue. While there are a number of action sequences, The Nice Guys is focused more on delivering humour and jokes based around a couple of reasonably well-developed characters and a mystery that's a little absurd and off- the-wall.The comedy on offer here is quality stuff. The Nice Guys isn't just the latest Apatow or Rogen production that seems to just recycle jokes from other movies. Many of the jokes are well- thought out and some of them are actually clever. There's also a number of more slapstick moments, but none of them come as hammy, including the sight of Ryan Gosling fumbling with his gun and cigarette while sat in a cubicle. The comedy can be a little dark at times though, so if you like lighter laughs, The Nice Guys probably isn't your kind of movie. On that note, I was quite surprised at the amount of violence, gore, and nudity in play. Thankfully it's only gratuitous when it needs to be (which in this movie basically means for comedic effect). People do die, sometimes gruesomely, and there are a lot of boobs and constant talk of sex and pornography, sometimes from kids. Again if these kinds of things offend your soft heart, avoid The Nice Guys.Talking of kids in this movie, one of the earliest lines refers to how kids these days know too much and act too grown up. This is a subtle theme of the entire movie. The line in question refers to a thirteen year old girl who chats up a guy three times her age for some weed, and another scene has a kid on a bike talking about his big dick, but more prominently is Angourie Rice who plays Holly, the PI's daughter, and shows a massive amount of maturity in every scene, often showing up her father in smarts. I would love to see a sequel set a number of years ahead where we follow a grown up Holly continuing her father's work.The father himself, Holland March, is Ryan Gosling on top form. Most of the roles I'd seen him play were super serious ones, and his mumbling, tortured personas, while fantastic, started to grate. Here he is completely different. He's a silly, fumbling idiot a lot of the time, and provides the most laughs. His sense of comedy timing is perfect, and his slapstick antics are flat-out hilarious. That's not to mean that he plays the fool. In a lesser actors hands, that's exactly how March's character would have come across, but Gosling manages to balance all the over-the-top comedy with something a bit more grounded. While he shows a lot of signs of idiocy, he also shows some intelligence that helps us believe his role as a father and detective. Unfortunately I can't level the same praise on Russell Crowe who I can't decide whether he phoned it in for the paycheck, or tried too hard. When it comes to comedy, Crowe is Gosling's opposite; almost entirely unfunny, even when his lines do a lot of the legwork for him. He's not a complete failure, but he looks awkward and uncomfortable more times than he doesn't. Margaret Qualley as the missing girl is also a bit of a swing and a miss. Her hysteric lunacy comes off more as a hormonal teenager shouting things she doesn't really mean, than a girl who believes fully in her claims and is determined for the world to know what she does. Thankfully there's Keith David, Matt Bomer, and Beau Knapp who more than make up for her in the supporting side of things.I never really laugh out loud when I'm by myself, especially in the cinema, but The Nice Guys had me chuckling heartily with alarming frequency. It's not a perfect movie, not even a perfect comedy, but it's right up there amongst the best comedies, for certain. I found it hilarious, and that's all that really mattered. I give it a solid 8/10 and would recommend.",8,88,126,7 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," This is Nuts!
","For at least the first hour of the movie, I sat there thinking 'This is nuts'. It's such an unimaginably bizarre world. Every character has a weird quirk about them, from a bronze nose to a breathing apparatus with teeth across it, from the white tattoos to spraying silver paint into their mouths. I mean you reach the precipice of WTF when the convoy drives out with a truck in the middle mounted with a wall of speakers, fronted by a blind dude suspended by rope playing a triple-necked guitar made of car parts, and carrying four massive war drums on the back.Imperior Furiosa is tasked with the latest gas run, but she has something else in mind as she smuggles out Immortan Joe's five young wives. So begins an epic car chase to get them back that takes up pretty much the entirety of the film's runtime. Yes, you read that right. Mad Max: Fury Road is pretty much a two hour car chase. A car chase through canyons and swamps and sand dunes and salt-lakes for miles and miles. There's even a catastrophic sand storm, complete with sand tornadoes and lightning, that gets in their way. Immortan Joe's warband is joined by other local warbands as well, leaving Max, Furiosa, and their charge of young women fending off a horde of crazed lunatics.Acting is of pretty high quality throughout as well. Charlize Theron was the perfect casting choice for Furiosa, with her difficult past behind her and her hope of a brighter future ahead. She's driven and smart, but not completely unreasonable. Rosie Huntington-Whitely, as much as it pains me to say it, wasn't too bad either. Even with a (fake) pregnancy bump weighing her down, she never lets it get in the way of being a born leader of her fellow wives. Nicholas Hoult was even quite good despite the somewhat cheesy dialogue and blinded-by-faith attitude. Tom Hardy was also admirable, as always. I'm a big fan of his, however this was far from the best performance I've seen of him, mainly because his quiet, brooding Max is a little too similar to his quiet, brooding portrayal of Forrest Bondurant in Lawless. In fact if it wasn't for the starkly different settings, it might've been easy to allude to them being the same person.With all that said though, let's face it, the real reason anyone is going to go and see Fury Road is for the visual spectacle. Oh, and what spectacle it is. Everything is grimy and barren. The world they inhabit is a wasteland devoid of green, devoid of water. A lot of the visual effects and stunts are in- camera as well. In fact there's only one bit that was obviously CGI, and that's when the debris of a massive crash comes hurtling towards the screen, you know, just to make extra good use of that 3D that I didn't watch it in. Other than that though, all the stunts and car crashes and explosions look so real and natural, because they really were done live, in camera. The choreography of the various segments of the sprawling car chase are meticulously thought out, and the actors and stuntmen hanging from car doors and hanging on to rooves for their lives adds such a massive sense of urgency and tension. I literally gasped at least once as Tom Hardy got just a little too close to the ground for my liking.Oh, and let's not forget the cars. Oh my, the cars. The Fast and Furious franchise has plenty for the lovers of actual cars, whether they're super cars or classic cars, but Fury Road's cars are something completely different. Each and every one is an individual, botched together of various car parts in order to make the most outrageous and extravagant vehicles. There's double- stacked Cadillacs with monster truck wheels, a truck fronted by three stacks of sedan grills, a camper bristled with spikes resembling a porcupine, a Pontiac with caterpillar tracks. There's elements of all sorts of vehicles from every time period; from the modern to the classic, from the practical to the sporty. There's massive, over-the-top wheels, and exposed engines, and open- backed boots. And it's not just the four-wheeled variety that gets dolled-up to the max, with skulls, vents, chains, pipes and spikes. The various motorbikes that appear all look uniquely bizarre as well.Fury Road is just plain good, adrenaline- fuelled fun. It looks great, it's got a great story, and some great characters brought to life by some great acting. It's superficially tense, and yet the world-building and character development makes it hugely engaging. There are a few things that are hard to swallow with scrutiny (like the shortage of fuel, which is best met by driving lots of gas-guzzling vehicles for miles and miles and miles somewhat recklessly, throwing petrol bombs all over the place, obviously), but with something as crazy as Fury Road, it's not hard to just ignore that and let yourself get taken in for the ride. I give Mad Max: Fury Road a bristling 9/10. BRING ON THE SEQUELS!",9,3,8,19 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," One of the Most Horrifying Depictions of War
","Hacksaw Ridge is a movie very neatly divided, and each section is better than the last. The first act is all introductions and character building. We meet a young Desmond Doss and his brother, including a near-fatal scuffle between them, sowing the seeds of Desmond's stubborn anti-violence stance. We establish that their father is an abusive drunk, haunted by the horrors of World War One. Desmond grows up, shows an early sense of heroism, and meets his beloved in a whirling romance, before he decides it's time he went and helped defend his country. This opening section is weak, to put it bluntly. It's kind of boring, very cheesy, and mirrors classic Hollywood quite a lot (and in more than just costumes and hair-styling). It has it's high points for sure, but I was almost ready to chuck this movie under the bus at this point. Hugo Weaving single-handedly manages to keep this act engaging. In the hands of a lesser actor, the role could've easily drifted into cliché abusive father tropes, but Weaving manages to tap into the trauma behind the abuse and make him a sympathetic figure. His breakdown at the table when Desmond's brother appears in military garb is heartbreaking.The second act shifts to the military training camp where Doss has to defend his anti- violence beliefs and convince his superiors not to force him out. This fight of faith is quite engaging to go through, and we get a real sense of who Desmond is, the lengths he will go to to stand for that, and the inner turmoil it creates for him. We also meet his comrades, including arsehole Smitty, pretty boy Hollywood, lassoing Tex, lanky Ghoul, and his various superiors. This is where the film picks up in entertainment value thanks in large part to Vince Vaughn's stern but comedic drill sergeant, but it doesn't entirely lose it's classics sheen of cheese, and is brought down a little by some cringe-worthy lines of dialogue.But the third act, which really encompasses the second half of the movie, is when Hacksaw Ridge shows it's hand and goes balls-to-the-wall. This is when Doss and his company are dispatched to Okinawa and are tasked with taking the titular ridge from the Japanese and holding it for long enough to get a foothold on the island. From the very first moments that the men clamber over the top of the cliff-edge, the tone of the movie completely changes. The land is desolate and strewn in corpses and body parts. The tension is amped up to eleven as the men slowly traverse the unforgiving landscape. The movie shifts almost into the horror genre, with jump-scares and a whole heap of gore and injury detail, and the cheesy melodrama of the first two acts suddenly makes sense; getting the audience into a false sense of security.I honestly cannot state enough how unsettlingly gory the second half of this movie is. It doesn't hold back in it's depiction of war. The first time they reach the ridge, and they traverse the corpse-strewn landscape, we see everything from decapitated heads, maggot-infested corpses, intestines and other internal organs splayed over rocks and trees. We're put right into the men's shoes, as their happy existence is suddenly and utterly shattered by the realism of their situation. Then a half-dead torso sits up and screams and all hell breaks loose. Soldiers are literally torn apart by a hail of bullets, blood, bone, and organs litter the ground, grenades and mortars explode every which way. The rate at which the movie goes from cheesy melodrama to horrific realism is like flicking a switch.It's only after this initial, harrowing assault on the ridge that the true purpose of the movie starts to rear it's head. As every surviving soldier retreats down the cliff edge back to safety, Doss is the only man who willingly remains on top, and he spends the better part of two days alone, retrieving and patching up injured soldiers left behind, and lowering them down to the beach below. He dodges detection by the Japanese at every turn, and uses every creative idea he has to make sure no-one else dies. He even helps patch up and save a few Japanese soldiers as well. The kicker is that all of this is entirely true, it happened. The real Doss saved over seventy-five soldiers in those two days alone. It's almost unbelievable, to the point where it must have been glorified or exaggerated in some way, but in fact Gibson actually cut out certain heroic acts fearing audiences wouldn't buy into them. Could Hacksaw Ridge really be the first movie based on a true story that actually had to dull down it's realism to make it more believable?!Hacksaw Ridge is definitely a movie I would recommend, despite it's opening shortcomings. It pains me to say it, but I'd have liked less backstory. Maybe start the story at the military training camp, and revisit his childhood and courting in flashbacks, or maybe just cut out the romance entirely (it's ultimately unimportant). Despite it's flaws at the beginning, the second half notches the movie up dramatically and completely flipped my opinion of the entire movie. It's a difficult watch, wrought with tension, adrenaline rushes, and disturbing imagery, but it really places you in the battle, and frames Desmond's heroism in an unparalleled way; even amongst all this horror, he never loses faith, he never loses courage, he never gives up and never quits. It's truly inspiring. I give Hacksaw Ridge a very good 8/10 (the second half is a solid 9, the first middling around a 6).",8,2,5,1 February 2017
Warcraft," So Much Story, So Little Time
","I'm not a Warcraft fan. In fact, I didn't even know there were games before World of Warcraft until this movie came out. However my qualms with the MMORPG have nothing to do with the gameplay or story, so I was still reasonably interested in seeing the movie version (or the movie version of those older games, at least). I went last night, which is unseasonably late for me to see a movie, I'll admit, but there were too many smaller movies that I feared would stop their run if I substituted either for Warcraft.Warcraft: The Beginning follows the start of the war between the Humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who have been driven away from their dying world. I figured that would be the extent of fantasy races we might see, but thankfully I was wrong as mages and wizards have a very strong presence (as someone who always plays the more mystical characters in an RPG, this made me quite happy), and dwarfs and elves have small cameos every now and then as well. There's even a strong hint at demons and dark magic.One of the biggest things that drew me to Warcraft was how it promised a balanced look at the two opposing sides of the conflict. Typically a movie like this will favour the human perspective and paint the alien creatures as the faceless enemy. It was refreshing to see this other race explored and developed, although it's very easy to pinpoint the changes Duncan Jones made to the script in order to do so. The development of the Orc factions is largely relegated to it's own little sub-plot, which disappointed me a bit. It has it's own beginning, middle, and end (an end that occurs well before the movie's climax), and rarely intercedes with the main storyline at all. In fact it almost squanders it entirely as it builds up to a different trade-off, but ultimately the movie has to reset it's status quo for the finale to still make sense. In this respect, and many others, the film does feel a little rushed at times. If there's anything I've learned from the movie, it's that the world of Azeroth is huge, with many different races, factions, cultures, and ways of doing things. There's no way anyone could do justice to this massive world in two hours, and as such some elements are included but glossed over. Often something happens and we quickly move to the next event with little downtime or explanation of whats going on. That said, what we do see of Azeroth feels rich and plentiful, and while the development of the Orcs could honestly have been cut entirely without any impact on the main story, it is refreshing to see their side of the war as well. We come to understand why they've been forced out of their world, and more crucially see that they're not just faceless evil, but they face their own form of evil and corruption. There's also a lot of development for the magical elements as well. Like everything in the movie I feel it should have been developed more, or just left out entirely.But moving away from the story, the special effects were sublime. This is high fantasy at it's best. The humans use big, ornate pieces of armour and weaponry, and yet it never looks campy or too over-the-top. There's griffin-like creatures, and giant wolves, and even some kind of large frog- like thing (yeah, it's starting to become obvious I've never played), and all look great, although Lothar's hand does seem to fall through the griffin when he pats it. The biggest triumph when it comes to the CGI though is with the Orcs. They get the Avatar/Gollum treatment, with motion- captured actors underneath, and it adds a huge amount of facial expression and body language that just wouldn't have been present otherwise. The sheer depth of variety in the Orcs is also great, as no two Orcs look the same.Warcraft: The Beginning, is a strong, if understandably flawed start of a promising franchise. It's biggest sin is trying to cram too much story in so little time, so I have no doubt it would have benefited from a longer running time, or even being split up into multiple movies. There's no denying that adapting such a rich universe like Warcraft would be a huge undertaking, but Duncan Jones took the challenge, and he was largely successful in delivering an entertaining, bombastic movie that appeals to fans and non-fans of the games alike. The music is top-notch (had the main theme stuck in my head all night), and the fate of many characters don't end at all how you'd expect, even if the main twist itself is hugely predictable. I give Warcraft an enjoyably flawed 7/10.",7,1,2,15 June 2016
Sully," Repetitive and Lacks Urgency
","I'm not a massive fan of Tom Hanks, and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a Clint Eastwood-directed movie, but I figured what the hell and went to see it anyway, it's a story I'm interested in learning a little more about. But if there's one thing the movie taught me, it's that I already knew pretty much the whole story already. Sully and his co-pilot lose both engines from a sing bird strike, start losing altitude fast, and quickly decide an unprecedented water landing on the nearby river is a safer option than attempting to make a ditch for a nearby airport. Through an unmatched amount of skill and luck, the landing goes as smoothly as can be, all the passengers survived with minor injuries, and Captain Sully is hailed a hero. The main narrative follows the investigation afterwards from the NTSB, as Sully attempts to convince the board that there was no other option, in the face of both computer and human simulations that tell them otherwise.I have two really big issues with this movie. The first is how repetitive it is. We see the incident at least three times, almost from beginning to end each time, just with slightly different perspectives; air traffic control, passengers, and cabin. It takes a while for these flashbacks to begin, instead offered nightmares of how it could've happened and gone catastrophically wrong, but once they start, we keep revisiting it over and over, and I'll be honest, it gets boring. These flashbacks become harder and harder to separate from the main narrative as we go on as well. There's a scene late in the movie where Sully is hugged by a hotel manager, but it's not immediately obvious when this scene actually takes place. It's only when his co-pilot asks why he's still in his uniform that it clicks that it's actually still part of the flashback, post-incident.My second issue, and this is a biggie, is that every time we see the incident, it lacks urgency, it lacks drama, it lacks suspense. At no point are we shown the gravity of the situation, only told how it was a miracle, how it was unprecedented, how it could've gone so much worse. As I understand it, the whole rescue operation took about twenty-four minutes, and I guess in the name of authenticity, Eastwood decided to show it in near enough to realtime, which slows everything down, loses all momentum of the accident and takes away the much needed urgency that lives could be at stake. We're told by news reporters that the passengers 'have minutes to live' but we're never given any indication that this is actually the case from watching the rescue itself. I don't know, maybe that was the point; to show how the media over-inflates everything to make it sound more dramatic and interesting? But then, wouldn't that just completely undermine the heroism Eastwood is simultaneously attempting to portray?It's not a complete failure of a movie though. Even though I haven't enjoyed a single Eastwood- directed movie I've seen, he's still reasonably talented on the more technical aspects. The film does look great, and what effects work there was is flawless (genuinely thought the David Letterman scene was re-enacted rather than just had Hanks et al's faces super-imposed). As off- putting as it was to see a reporters face large and centre in front of a blurred background, it did at least have the resemblance of artistry behind it.Tom Hanks' work is admirable, of course. He isn't such a celebrated and high-demanded actor for no reason, and his Sully is likable and empathetic, but rightly conflicted and affected by the incident. Aaron Eckhart's Skiles is more down-to-earth and jokey, but not entirely without effect. Laura Linney doesn't get a whole lot to do, spending a hundred percent of her screen time on the phone, but she manages to serve as the emotional backbone to the movie, as annoyingly insignificant as her role may be. Anna Gunn probably impressed me the most, as NTSB investigator Elizabeth Davis. In a way she's the sympathetic investigator on the board, without undermining the authority of her position. The break in her voice during the hearing as the NTSB's agenda is brought down is powerful. She also gets bonus points for almost making me forget how annoying Skyler was in Breaking Bad.Sully clocks in at a relatively short ninety minutes, but that's still too long, and the film still feels like it was padded out with filler, overly slow-moments, and repetitive flashbacks. It somehow manages to drag along, and then concludes abruptly on weird joke. It lacks urgency, which in the retelling of a real-life emergency is a big oversight, and I'll be honest, I was actually kind of bored by the movie's end. I give it a meandering and over-sentimental 6/10.",6,2,4,14 December 2016
Alien: Covenant," Prometheus 2 Merged with Traditional Alien Movie
","I'm aware that I'm one of few in the world who actually really enjoyed Prometheus and it's philosophical musings on the creation of life, so to hear the next movie was just another 'Alien' film didn't particularly excite me; we've had four of them already. I want to know more about the Engineers, I want to know why they created humanity, and why they decided to wipe the slate clean. I wanted to delve into their society and really see what they were like as a civilisation. Covenant is both an Alien movie and a Prometheus movie. It's a best-of-both-worlds scenario. The movie opens, right from the get-go, with the creation of David by the hands of Guy Pearce's Weyland. David shows an inquisitive and introspective nature that serves as a prologue to the events that will unfold, and it's important to keep this scene in mind as the movie goes on. The movie then jumps to a new colony ship, ten years after the events of Prometheus, with an upgraded model of David looking after it's 3,000+ inhabitants. Things go wrong, the crew awaken, they land on a mysterious planet, and all hell breaks loose.The crew of the Covenant eventually meet up with a long-haired David, and we get a lot of insight into what he's been up to since the previous movie, and where Elizabeth Shaw is in all this. We even, and most tantalisingly, get to see a little hint of the Engineers' civilisation. Not going to lie, this was the highlight of the movie for me. I mean yeah, I would've liked a proper Prometheus 2 where we actually see all of it unfold rather than the short (but sweet) narrated flashbacks we got, but I'll take what I can get. Furthermore, it cleverly shifts the role of antagonist from the Xenomorphs to David himself, which is necessary as Xenomorphs stopped being scary nearly thirty years ago. David, on the other hand, becomes a villain of the ages, displaying unparalleled sadism in a quest of scientific curiosity.Beyond that, the movie makes a big effort to mirror, and in some cases directly homage the original Alien movies. The wooden bird toy dipping it's beak into a glass of water is here, some choice lines of dialogue are lifted and supplanted from the original, and even the general format of the story. SPOILER ALERT BUT NOT REALLY: The crew returning to the ship safely in orbit is not the end of the horror. The original Xenomorph returns as well, with it's large head, secondary jaws, and protruding back spikes. While Scott has said he has more movies planned, and once again I find myself yearning for a direct sequel to carry this story on, Covenant pretty much ties the origins of the Xenomorphs up nice and tidy, making the need for more movies a bit suspect.Probably the biggest problem for Covenant is it's characters. There's a lot of crew members, and most of them get no development at all. Crucial to the crew's makeup is that they're all couples, but we're never really shown who's with who soon enough, despite the constant bits of dialogue that point out 'my wife'. I spent quite a large portion of the movie trying to figure the couples out. The homosexual couple in particular were so poorly handled that you only realised they were a gay couple when one of them dies. Thankfully there's a fairly easy fix to this, put the Last Supper prologue sequence back in the movie, showing the whole crew before they enter cryosleep. We see them banter, gossip, and enjoy each others company for a bit, making them feel human and providing a little source of attachment to them. Alas I had to watch this an hour ago on my computer, after I'd already seen the movie and the damage of no development had already been done.That said, there is some good acting here regardless. Katherine Waterston was easily the least annoying that I've seen her, Billy Crudup does remarkably well with the flimsy role he's given, and Danny McBride forgoes the crass humour to display some dramatic chops. Of course though, Michael Fassbender is the star of the movie, relishing the opportunity to play two similar, but very different characters. In fact, the best scenes were with Michael Fassbender talking to Michael Fassbender. The conflict of wills and ideals between Walter and David were truly tantalising, and seeing David back and more evil than before was thoroughly entertaining. Fassbender owned both sides with complete conviction, being both a force to cheer on, and a force to fear and hate in equal measure.I found Alien: Covenant a lot more enjoyable than I expected, but I did have my expectations set to catastrophically low. It completely lacks any character development, is riddled with stupid, nonsensical decisions in order to drive the plot forward, and isn't nearly as horrifying as it should be. That said, it feels more like an Alien movie than Prometheus did, while simultaneously not just brushing Prometheus under the rug. Would I like to see the hypothetical movie between Prometheus and Covenant? Absolutely, but at this point I don't feel it would particularly add much. Similarly, would I like another movie to bridge the gap between Covenant and Alien? Again, yes, but also again I'm not sure what purpose it would serve in the narrative. Covenant feels like a perfect marriage between the two. I give Alien: Covenant an enjoyable, but hardly groundbreaking 7/10. I recognise it's flaws, and there are many, but I simply enjoyed it too much to not give it a positive rating.P.S. Please release a Director's Cut with the two prologues actually in the movie. 'The Crossing' is as close as I'll ever get to a proper Prometheus 2, and 'The Last Supper' would've done wonders for character development.",7,9,18,16 May 2017
Furious 7," A disappointing send-off for Paul
","The F&F franchise is a franchise unlike any other. It just keeps getting more and more successful. I have no idea how they managed that. I remember being captivated by the first one, started drifting with the second, skipped the third, and then found an old love with four and five. This one, unfortunately, was hit with tragedy due to the untimely death of one it's leading stars; Paul Walker, and it's future looked shaky at best. Re-writes and reshoots aimed to salvage the movie took place and, more than anything, I was intrigued to see what kind of effect it all had. The good news is it had barely any effect at all.Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard, is back and seeking revenge after the events of the last movie. This (somehow) leads Toretto into the hands of a shady Government arm led by Mr. Nobody who needs a hacker to activate a government surveillance program. Uh? Apparently Toretto needs to find Shaw before Shaw finds him, and to do that he needs the surveillance program. Unfortunately the hacker's been kidnapped by some guy so they need to get her back first. This all results in that massive cliffhanger from six meaning jack-s***. Deckard is not the main villain here. We do not get an intimate story where the Furious Family is hunted by a stone-cold killer. Instead we get a nameless villain with more military hardware than the rest of the world combined, and Shaw just appears every now and then to make the heists more difficult.Yeah, story wise I am left very disappointed. It didn't deliver on anything it promised from the last film. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. The movie has a very strong start. We see what Deckard is capable of and our characters are left in a sustained peril as they're being hunted by him. Key characters are temporarily (and permanently) put out of the picture. It's going good. But as soon as Mr. Nobody and his bizarre organisation comes in, the great direction is left as a sub-plot to a much inferior angle. I understand they're trying to establish Mr. Nobody ready for an upcoming movie, but it ruined this one.The stunts and action sequences are even more over-the-top than what you might find in The Expendables. You've got cars parachuting out of planes, drone chases in downtown LA, hypercars jumping three skyscrapers, and The Rock loses. Okay that last one was actually done really well, defeating Hobbs the only way you could imagine defeating him. The rest though? I'm out. I get the over-the-top, fun angle. It's going for those classic action movies that are so bad and so silly they're good, but I feel at this point it's come far too far from it's roots. I mean, this is like 2 Fast 2 Furious all over again.Which is ironic because the film definitely tries to tie to it's roots. We get even more cameos from past cast members, including Hector from the very first movie (Who's Hector? He's the generic latino guy that speaks maybe two lines) and Lucas from Tokyo Drift, and of course the dedication to Paul at the end complete with flashbacks to all the other movies. This is the film's single biggest saving grace. It was nice to tie more solidly to Tokyo Drift, the movie I still haven't seen yet, and bring Hector back for two more lines. Paul's memorial though? Perfect. I was almost brought to tears. It was a great send-off and the best way to tie the franchise off with a nice little bow. Shame it's going to get undermined by the incomprehensible box office success. Furious 8 will crash and burn without Paul, I guarantee it.On that note the lack of Paul was barely noticeable. I kept a keen eye out for some bad CGI of his face, but honestly it was so seamless I didn't notice any. The only time I could really tell was his last big fight scene with Tony Jaa. You don't see his face at all. It's all filmed in the dark using the same camera trickery they use with stunt doubles. You know it's Brian O'Connor, because you don't see a different face. The fact you don't see his face doesn't undermine that at all. Big props to how they handled that. That said, for the only particularly noticeable Paul-less scene, it was a bit superfluous and unnecessary. They could've just cut it out and saved themselves the bother.Furious 7 is a disappointing send-off for Paul. It has some good ideas, particularly at the beginning, the ending is wonderful, and there's some real comedy gold here as well, but the whole middle section, forcing in a heist for no obvious reason, introducing new characters without reason, and not really developing them either, let the whole thing down. What breathed new life into the F&F franchise was a slightly new direction. That new direction has not only gone too far away from it's roots, but it's also starting to get very repetitive. I will not be rushing out to the inevitable Furious 8. I give Furious 7 a disappointing 6/10.",6,1,14,7 April 2015
