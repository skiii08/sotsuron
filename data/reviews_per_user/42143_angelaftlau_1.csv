Kill Bill: Vol. 2," better than 1st
","surprisingly good.I loved it.My boyfriend didn't.He expected all action like the 1st volume,but it was 'deeper' than that.It had more heart.One of my favorite movies and iv seen A lot.You got to know a lot of the characters.The dialogue that some would call boring was genius at times and at the least interestingly profound.Also very funny in a few parts.And for the people who called themselves complaining about the lack of violence....How much do you want?Because there was plenty of violence.It seemed to me that every time i got pulled into the great conversations someone had to go at it.There was the perfect amount of violence,and the perfect amount of everything else.I cant stress how much i loved this movie.Also uma therman should have got some kind of award.KILL BILL 2!!!!!",10,0,1,8 September 2006
