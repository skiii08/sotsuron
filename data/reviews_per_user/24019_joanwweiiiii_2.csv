Captain Phillips," 'Everything is gonna be okay'
","As much as we as the audience know beforehand – spoilers alert – that Captain Rich Phillips survived the ordeal at sea back in April 2009, the movie chronically bringing the incredibly dangerous situation to life and holding your heart until the last second of the miraculous rescue. Captain Phillips is superb at portraying not only the desperately hijacked and kidnapped Americans, but also at bringing depth into the lives and desperation of the Somali pirates. You are disgusted at the senseless crime, yet couldn't help but feel for the pirates, essentially teenagers who were under the control of crime lords, lived in poverty, and never given a chance. It is heartbreaking to hear Muse repeatedly mumble 'everything is gonna be okay' as if he himself is trying to desperately grasp any last hope while watching a train wrack in slow motion.Great acting from Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. Good directing and script overall. My only complaint is the movie went overboard with the 'US military saves the day' propaganda. But hey I guess we taxpayers paid for the ships and helicopters and weapons for a reason. The one thing you will learn from this movie is DON'T MESS WITH THE Americans. If you enjoy a good Hollywood thriller with positive reinforcements, this film is for you. 8/10",8,0,1,23 January 2014
The Hurt Locker," Horendous
","I am more than enraged when the announcer uttered 'Hurt Locker' as the Oscar Best Motion Picture. SERIOUSLY? Did you not watch Inglorious Bastards or Up in the Air or any other movies in the category??? The rest is up to personal opinion so let's not get too carried away and make an objective evaluation of this 'movie', or whatever they call this piece of motion picture.You'd only have to be someone growing up in the liberal part of the world who has minimal amount of common sense to know that this movie is completely fantasy land. No military would have tolerated such immature heroic behaviors in an active war zone for more than a day. The audience is not looking for documentary-style accuracy, granted, but would very soon become disgusted when they are treated like idiots! This movie failed to create any remotely believable characters or scenarios. Half way through the movie, I was stunned in disbelief in how something like this could be nominated, and even won, the best picture of 2010, or ever.To be fair I would probably rated this movie 3 out of 10 because I do enjoy the performance from Renner for whatever plots he had left to work with. The cinematography is gray and dusty throughout but I wouldn't say horrible. However, given how bloated the rating is on this site, I'm going to opt for an one to counter the opinions.Academy I had higher expectations for you than this. What can I say. Love hurts.",1,5,6,28 January 2014
