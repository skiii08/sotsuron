Blade Runner 2049," horrible
","It's dragging. It's like watching a movie in slow motion; the movie should have been 1 hour shorter. Chock full of cheap clichés, most of them too old and silly for the 21st century. This was my third and last attempt to watching this crap and I gave up some 50 mins before the end just to make sure I won't vomit. 3/10",3,5,11,23 February 2020
The Lost City of Z," nope
",If you like cheap Indian melodramas go ahead and waste over 2 hours on this quite unremarkable production. It's like a high-schooler's first attempt at a script tossing in all the overused tricks that might impress an immature audience. As bad as a soup opera but way longer (so should I say as bad as 5 soup operas?)...,3,2,8,3 July 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," what a joke! Run!
","holy cow, I was determined not to read the badly written book, like so many millions of dumbs read it just for having an insane brit PR and I did not want to see da stupid movie. But I do stupid s**t when I'm drunk (like posting inanities online; 2 FB sites banned me just today ..) Well, anyway, being drunk and unable to post on the sites that just banned me I saw this monstrosity. OK now, she is somehow sweet, but no big deal (decent eyes and lips, mediocre boobs), the script is insanely idiotic, the dialog lines are retarded, the dude (while decent from the neck down) has a face and voice that you wanna puke! An involuntary badly written/directed comedy that will totally ruin yer day, period!",1,10,19,21 February 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," What a sad joke ..
","Really childish movie, this planet is going dumber by the minute. Obviously the dudes well-connected enough to write for Hollywood can't  umm  write. Just a few points: (1) not one intelligent (or at least funny) line of dialog in over 140 minutes; (2) The 'Games' started after 81 worthless minutes; can't they afford to hire some reasonably intelligent dude to do some editing?; (3) The characters were one-dimensional (like in some fourth grader first attempt at writing): the big bro and the peace keepers-- ALL-EVIL, while Jennifer and her buddies were ALL-WONDERFUL; (4) The 'Games' were ridiculously uncreative: poisonous fog that can be treated with water, really?!; (5) Not one twist during 146 min, except for the lame one (cuz it was overly expected, since it has to be at least some twist in any movie, right?) with the games director in the end. If you're not part of the ridiculous tribe of low IQed 11-yo schoolgirls worshiping Bieber: RUN! My rating: 3/10",3,190,357,5 December 2013
