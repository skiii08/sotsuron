Gremlins," Elite Score and Atmosphere
",The score and the atmosphere make this movie so fantastic. I finally was able to put a finger on it.,8,1,2,3 October 2019
It Follows," No Horror Here
","Nothing scary at all. Not even jump scares!! The only reason it even deserves one star is curiosity. I was just wondering where it was going. Well, it even let me down there. Worst movie I've seen in a while. I have no idea the point of even making it.",1,2,4,12 October 2019
Midsommar," Mindless Drivel
",The director just wanted to do a bunch of messed up stuff in broad daylight with the backdrop of beautiful scenery. It's a weird movie and you won't get anything from it. You'll see the ending coming a mile away.,1,6,13,23 January 2020
