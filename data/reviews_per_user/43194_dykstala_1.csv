Insidious: Chapter 2," Absolute Excellence
","I am an absolute fan of James Wan's recently filmography, my favorite being Insidious. I had high hopes for this movie, and although not in the way I expected, the movie satisfied my love for the first film and provided me with more to think about for the next three years. The movie had me engaged from start to finish, and uniquely split the movie into edge-of-your seat terror and mind blowing suspense. If you love hardcore scares though, the 'mystery side of the film still gave (and still gives) me chills, so the overall feel may still deprive me of my otherwise consistent sleep. The camera angles and the plot connections to the first movie are simply extraordinary! Although it is not the scare machine that the first is, and although it had no freaky random face behind the main characters head out of nowhere, it still provided me with the mind consuming, parasitic feeling that the fist film did. All and all, I have no disappointment in Insidious: Chapter Two! Bravo James Wan! *****THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE FILM WITH SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONFUSED*****Lets just say this to begin. The first movie connects directly to this movie. Like, the first movie writes out the second. When the movie begins, it shows a young Elise (kudos to the actress who plays her, she looks and sounds a lot like the 'old' Elise) helps out young Lorraine with her son, Josh, who is inflicted with extreme night terrors of an old woman. Then, the movie picks up right into the cold-blooded murder of Elise in our 'present time.' In the movie, we later learn that Josh is truly stranded in the further, the 'old woman,' truly a serial killer (and a man), Parker Crane is possessing Josh in the physical world and Dalton is picking up on the trouble with his dad. When all the dust clears, the possessed Josh attempts to kill for his corrupt dead mother while the real Josh runs around the Further and alters the events of the first movie while trying to destroy the essence of our ghostly antagonist. Josh finds Elise, who we learn is still secretly helping the men Specs and Tucker (from the first film). Josh and Elise destroy the entity and Josh lives in his own body again, and the Lamberts ride off into the fluffy sunset of unicorns, rainbows and marshmallows. Well, what the hell James Wan!? Oh wait, Wan wouldn't ever provide that kind of disappointment in any movie (with the exception of the Conjuring)... The film ends with the Specs and Tucker duo investigating another possession. While Specs and Tucker stall the home-owners, the dead Elise sneaks into the house and stares into a dark corner of the house to see the entity apparently haunting the family in the home. Although we do not see the entity itself, we see Elise in a state of total peril as she sais, 'oh my GOD!' as the movie goes into credits and our ears are shot out by the beloved music of the franchise.
