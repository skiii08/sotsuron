It," Up Close and Personal with Pennywise
","It is the end of the 1989 school year in the beautiful town of Derry Maine. Summer vacation has begun for Bill and his friends 'the losers', and they're dodging their psychopathic bully classmate Henry and something even darker lurking in the sewers below. IT delivers the jarring contrast of sweet childhood friendship and warm small town summer days with the everyday dangers of molesting parents, bullies and the far worse supernatural terror of Pennywise the Clown. The film is rife with 'jump scares', but the pace is too fast and repetitive. There are too many encounters with the Losers escaping Pennywise. The director gives into the temptation of turning the movie into a 'chase' film. Pennywise is too revealed, stripping away his mystery and terror. The magic and eeriness of a good horror story are mostly missing. The viewer doesn't need to see Pennywise's tonsils, nor in extreme close up. The art of the horror story is lacking and veers instead into action film territory.",7,2,9,10 September 2017
A Star Is Born," Glorious destruction
","Well, an old faded and genuinely screwed up but talented singer meets his musical muse and destiny in young Ally. In age old fashion, this happy union has the seeds of it's own destruction sewn right in. Jack's swimming in his addictions and even the support and love he gets from Ally aren't protection from drowning. He finally gives in to his struggles and commits suicide.
It's too bad death is such a glorified end in romance. I would far rather see Jack do the boring day to day work of being alive and getting his head on straight than ending it all in dramatic fashion. That is the way of the romeo and juliette storyline. This film has so much drama and kind of a bad message but is o well acted and filmed. The music is perfection.",9,3,6,10 October 2018
"I, Tonya"," Hardings and Giloolys stories laid on the table-you decide....
","Amazing film- the director handled the material objectively and with fantastic character development. Getting to know Tonya Harding was a trip. She came from the depths of poverty and abuse with no connections, yet used her considerable fortitude and discipline to sculpt her natural talent into skating gold. I loved the fact she could fix cars, shoot guns and sew her own clothing from scratch. Yes other skaters work hard, but most have the luxury of money and support at home. Tonya Harding had none of this; she wore the badge of 'white trash' and fought biased judges and the elitist skating community making her achievements ever the more exceptional. 
The Kerrigan attack is presented quite differently between Hardings and Gilooly's retelling. The movie leaves the viewer to decide on what really happened. And as in all memories of our personal stories, the mind colours events and distorts truth. I love this movie for letting us decide.",10,2,3,21 January 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Queen Biopic Extraordinaire
","Bohemian Rhapsody delivers a deep and thoughtful exploration of the life of Freddie Mercury. Seeing the joyride rise of the band and exploring their lasting bond was both lovely and crushing. Queen was clearly a family capable of producing music like no other band, music that stands the tide of time.",9,3,5,7 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Disney Light plot with predictable old values agenda
","The last Avengers ended with a philosophically valid dilemma. Stop the overpopulation of all worlds by halving the population in the universe in order to save humans and other species. The only mention of environment in Endgame was Captain America stating 'a pod of whales was seen in the Hudson, if you want to look at the bright side' to which Black Widow replies 'I will throw this sandwich at you'. Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own. But no, that is completely ignored and the ecosystem crushing population returns. Very generic plot, disappointing.",1,291,512,20 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Too many characters, prolonged action scenes become monotonous
","SPOILER: The plot follows Thanos around on his quest to collect 5 stones, achieve control of all dimensions and eliminate half of humanity in an attempt to save planets from population induced ecosystem destruction/annihilation. Each stone quest involves 10 minutes or so of the same CGI fighting. Why 5 stones? Why not, they've got time to fill. Lots and lots of time. Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way. He should have sterilized half the planet, not dissolve them.",2,322,793,2 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 2 hours and 40 minutes passed in a flash
","Beautifully toned, rich footage-panning decadently over each scene, gives the viewer a bird's eye seat into the gritty and glamorous details of Hollywood in the 1960s. Brad Pitt is at his best as Cliff Booth, a loyal and affable friend with an unlikely strong moral compass, while conversely burdened with a dark past. Leonardo DiCaprio's perfect portrayal of Rick Dalton is so sad and earnest - his talent buried by the success of his cheesy much loved 'Bounty' character. Dalton and Booth have an enduring deep friendship which is truly the star of this movie. Once Upon a Time is such a treat to watch. I'm sure I will see it again and again to catch more of the glorious detail that Tarantino plants throughout.",9,11,18,7 August 2019
Magic Mike XXL," Well done gentlemen
","If only there were an Oscar for hotness. Kudos to channing, joe, matt, adam and kevin (not to forget Michael strahan, dashuan and crew). Respect to the actors for working out so hard to achieve such perfect bodies! Joe and Channing were standout dancers. Straight up talent. Matt Bomer surprised with an incredible singing voice. It is amazing fun to watch these performances. The female characters were kind of duds. Could do without psychoanalyzing the one dimensional women (got a bit embarrassing at points esp the scene with Andie mcdowell and her wino middle aged desperate lady friends-gay husband, crying b/c i don't feel attractive ugh stereotype much). Guess what, women just enjoy the show, not because they have low self esteem or need someone to make them feel beautiful. It's just fun to watch hot guys dance!",8,1,8,5 July 2015
