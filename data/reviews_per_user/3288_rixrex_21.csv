Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Putrid potboiler glorifying gangsterism with comic book characters, PT 2
","I thought nothing could get worse than part 1, but part 2 managed to do it. It continues the super slick presentation of part 1, the glorification of what is evil in the world, and don't give that garbage about how evil is equivocal. These people kill people and have no sense of humanity beyond themselves and their own selfish world. This director is twisted, in his world love is a selfish design, and there's no room for sacrifice. Why do people like Kiddo? She's the least evil of the evil. And are we really supposed to believe that core of martial art training is to provide assassins? But what really makes this one worse than part 1 is the outstandingly awful over-acting of David Carradine, a lousy attempt to present himself as a wise sage of some sort. It seems that with Carradine, less is better. The less he's seen, the better. The less he says, the better. He needs to stop playing Caine from Kung Fu. But at least Caine was a considerate human. And what was that crud about a truth serum he invented? What a contrivance. This two film series is a big contrivance.",Null,2,4,20 July 2005
Hostel," Not exceptional, but better than average, with an homage to original TCM
","I recently saw the unrated DVD version, and the main difference seems to be that the DVD has an excessive use of the F word, which is rather distracting and unnecessary. Generally this is just as good as Cabin Fever, Roth's initial film, and very similar in style, not subject. The nice thing about Roth's films is the time he spends with what seem fairly ordinary or mundane activities of the characters, behaving in mostly superficial fashion, but there is actually more to this behavior within the development of the plot. For one thing, these mundane activities are later shown to be paramount to the scenes of horror that are to come. Also, they allow the characters to behave as most people actually do, which is to maintain a fairly superficial persona except amongst the closest of friends and family, until in here when faced with their impending death. The sex in the film is always non-personal, and this is a precursor for the murder-club. Within this framework is a horror film that is grisly and gory enough to satisfy most of the gore-fans who don't care about plot, though obviously not all judging from the comments stating that the film took too long to get to the scenes of terror. This is actually a nice combination of American styled horror films and European Giallo terror, just as Cabin Fever was, and has a satisfying revenge-type ending. I will not divulge the 1973 Texas Chainsaw Massacre homage, but it will be obvious to those who know the original TCM and is quite enjoyable.",Null,1,2,26 May 2007
The Terminator," Fun sci fi film shows why time travel is a ridiculous notion...
","Sorry, I like Terminator but don't hold it in the same esteem as many others. I just don't see that it is any better than any other good and fun sci fi films that really aren't much more than a thrill ride.But one thing it does have going for it that's great is that it shows how ridiculous the notion of time travel really is. For those who think such must be possible, you probably slept through or didn't take a class in physics. Since time is nothing more than an arbitrary measurement of relative motion of objects in relation to one another, it does not truly have a forward or backward direction. Einstein knew this and that's why he related time to physical motion, hence the name, Theory of Relativity, and he saw the perception of time as variable dependent upon the relative 'speed' of the subject, but it's doubtful that many sci-fi fans understand this. (As proof. watch how many NO's I get on this) They believe that one can fall into a black hole and pop out through a wormhole into another time or faraway location in the universe, when all that would happen is they'd be crushed into being part of the dense matter of the black hole.The abstract ideations called 'the past' and 'the future' are more a product of mental awareness of this motion which creates events that are kept in memory (known to us as the past) or events considered as possible through conjecture (known as the future). Time travel only can exist as a mental abstract ideation, and that's it.Such travel is shown as being physically impossible in Terminator due to this scenario: Terminator is sent to the past by cyborg rulers to kill the birth mother of human John Conner, who threatens later cyborg rule. Human Reese is sent by humans to stop the terminator. He becomes the father of human John Conner who later threatens cyborg rule. Basically an impossible event, shown as such by what would have been the initial series of events, as envisioned this way...Mom Conner would not have had son John in the first place without Reese, who would not have been sent after all because the terminator would not have been sent since John did not exist. Or envision this...Had cyborg rulers not sent terminator, then Reese would not go and could not father John Conner....And there are many other variations on these scenarios as well...Pretty much an impossible conundrum, which just goes to show that the notions of past and future only exist in our mental awareness, and everything that actually exists in our reality and our universe really has just one time of existence, the now and present.Even our memories of the past, notions of the future, and awareness of current existence which is due to the relative motion of objects, all happen within the now and present, the only actual 'time' that is based in reality.For those who would dismiss this because you really want to believe in time travel, well, you certainly aren't Einstein.",Null,2,11,5 June 2011
Silent Hill," Another violent vid game movie with Lovecraftian imagery that ends up crap.
","Not having seen the VG, I was completely ignorant of the story or plot of this horror entry. Now that I have seen it, I am no longer ignorant of the plot, and I realize that the plot is what is ignorant, what little there is of it. This starts out promising enough, very similar to a 1970s European horror film, with a somewhat haunted little child. Not an unusual theme for that earlier time. It's far-fetched that the mother would get the bug to visit Silent Hill on what's pretty much a whim, but the film must progress, and that's not unheard of in horror films. The imagery we see once we get fully engulfed in the town's depths is quite startling and nightmarish. But then the whole story of the good people who are really bad because they are intolerant religious fanatics, and the bad 'demon' who is really good because she was wronged by these fanatics is really the turning point, turning what could have been something quite eerie into yet another unsubtle revenge melodrama with violent imagery. This then becomes yet another one in the long, long list of VG based horror films, and really most modern horror films, that are long on style and very, very short on having an engaging story. It's getting tiring to see the constant juxtaposition of religious fanatics as the really bad people, do any of these filmmakers really think nobody gets their less than subtle commentary for what it really is, a slander on religion and the faithful in general? With people getting thrills out of violent tripe like this (and rating it a 10 no less), there is no wonder that many think of this society as decedent and immoral.",Null,1,2,11 December 2006
Crash," Subject material wins over substance, and not the best of the year.
","Often it's heard that style wins over substance or visa versa, yet here's a matter where the subject material wins hands down over that actual substance of the film, and in fact, style tops substance here as well. There are moments of genius and then these are tempered by some of the most inane and absurd scenes to be in any academy award winning best film of the year. There's great acting, great dialog, and a mastery of cinematic statement, then in the next moment there's trite scriptwork, flat cardboard characterizations, and ordinary visuals that could be topped by a TV production. I suppose this might have to do with the nature of the experience, the juxtaposition of the lives of the several challenged individuals, the involvement of the actors and possible non-involvement of some, and perhaps even the order in which scenes were filmed. While I enjoyed this film, I do not see in it the same power of statement that I saw in Boyz and the Hood, for example. I also see that some of it rings true and then much of it also rings false. Of course, there is always the big problem inherent in all motion pictures of using stereotypical behavior to send the big message, after all it is only a two hour or so experience and a lot has to be said, and stereotypes help us to GET IT?! quickly. That's a tough thing for a film intent on breaking down stereotypes to rely upon. If you think there's no stereotyping here, you'd better look at it again and pay close attention to the Asian portrayals, the temperamental Persian man, and Sandra Bullock and hubby. Oh, I almost forgot the gun shop owner, Hollywood's idea of every American male between LA and NY City. A very good, nearly great work, but not the best of the year. Of course that's purely 'in my opinion', please do not take it personally. You should see this film regardless, and it is better than the other one it beat out.",Null,1,3,20 July 2006
The Italian Job," Decent acting and exciting scenes almost save it.
","I caught this on the cable TV last night, and probably would have liked it better in the theater.  It really needs to be on a big screen for good impact.  The acting is passable to very good, but these are characters we've all seen before with very little beyond stereotypes.  The whole story is telegraphed in the first half hour and the only thing to keep interest is how they'll do it.  We know they'll go after the gold and get even with Steve, but how will it be done?  That's really the only question in any of these gang retaliation type of stories.  Basically these are set up so that we have a bunch of bad guys versus a bunch of worse bad guys, so we root for the lesser bad guys.  Really typical and not at all original.  And the character of Steve by Edward Norton was more like Norton of THE HONEYMOONERS.  What an incompetent and weak-kneed crime lord.  He looked as though he could have been done in by a minimum wage security guard. Definitely in the running for the puniest criminal in film history.",Null,0,3,24 August 2004
The Village," Shyamalan's worst, dumb plot is a 30 min Twilight Zone padded out to 2 hrs
","What a drop from two 10's (Sixth Sense, Signs) and a 9 (Unbreakable) to this lousy excuse for a film. Remember when the Twilight Zone would do this kind of story in a half-hour and do it better? The surprise of there being a modern world outside of the village is no surprise at all. It was all spelled out in big letters: AMISH-LIKE VILLAGE. If you didn't see this coming, well you must have fallen asleep. It's so ludicrous as to be laughable, this wonderful utopia hidden away in a forest and protected by who knows whose tons of money. So much so that they can bribe the FAA to make it a no-fly zone. Yes, that's right, it's utopia built on lies and deceit and the filthy money they so disdain. Oh, of course the outside world is rotten, and they aren't. But within this utopia, we see envy, jealousy, murder. They wanted to get away from it and brought it with them. I doubt this was supposed to be one of the points, it's just serendipity that it's there at all. As for the village setup, logic would say put it in a faraway place where there would be no need for a big fence and security, not in the middle of New York or Pennsylvania. I would give it a 1, but there are some genuinely spooky moments in the beginning, so it gets 2. Here's hoping this will be the only low point of Shyamalan's film career.",Null,0,1,10 June 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Above average remake, half better than the original, yet half worse.
","The Hills Have Eyes, 1977 version, is one of the films that always requires inclusion in the seminal horror film period starting with Night of the Living Dead, and continuing up through the 1970s. These were films that were Drive-In flicks that constantly pushed the boundaries, and were the precursors to today's modern gore-filled horror films. The remake attempts to take the basic premise, updated and technically superior, and make a B-movie into an A film. This is what most of the remakes of these great 70s horror films try to do. This new version of Hills Have Eyes does an excellent job and still maintains its own individuality.In these ways it is better than the original: Much more interesting detail and story about the desert mutants, and more of them as well. Technically superior, which is what we all like to see. Better direction of characters, sorry to Wes Craven but it's true. Good use of Pluto, the most interesting mutant character, but who was used in an inferior manner in the first, a waste of the great Michael Berryman.However, in these ways it is the lesser of the two: Bad use of Papa Jupiter (who looks like John Carradine in his later horror films), basically relegated to second class mutant status here and not really that scary (James Whitworth was SCARY!). A lousy job of redoing the final scene where Papa Jupiter meets his finish, the original is 1,000% better. Dwells too long on the burning scene, which is not necessary. A little too much anticlimax in the fight between Pluto and the Democrat turned NRA member.Both are great at the development of tension and suspense, and both have very eerie atmosphere. Fortunately watching one will not ruin the other at all. Then also include in your viewing, The Hills Have Eyes Part 2, 1985, if only to see John Bloom as the Reaper!",Null,0,2,16 October 2006
Disturbia," Best Teen Slasher film in a LONG time...
","While not the typical teen slasher film, Disturbia is successful because it isn't typical. A sort of loose combination of Rear Window and Wm Castle's I Saw What You Did, this fine film manages with dexterity to rise above the squalid stereotypical teens meet killer with a knife trash that is so common, and does this with fine performances, giving us realistic people who we can care about and feel empathy for. A tight script and suspenseful storyline help very much, plus the fact that these are not the 'jock and bimbo' teen types, a line in the film that serves this purpose well. It's been a long time since I've seen films with teens who are normal and nice people, relatively so, interact with adults in reasonable fashion. They are usually presented as the all-knowing soothsayers with the adults as ignorant annoyances to the teens' adventures. Also finally figured out what 'disturbia' really means. Recommended highly!",Null,0,2,6 May 2008
Van Helsing," Hypertensive, overblown and was done better several times already.
","Much too much of everything except good plot and characterization.  Peter Cushing is still the best Van Helsing, and Christopher Lee the most believable energetic Dracula, and Lugosi cannot be beat for suave and subtle sex appeal. This new Dracula didn't know whether to be Lugosi or Lee, and the whole sub-plot of Vlad the Impaler is thrown away. The wolfmen (there are three) try to bring pathos to their curse, but Chaney, Jr and Oliver Reed both did it better.  And remember when the Frankenstein monster was the most fearsome creature in the Universal arsenal, not some weak sister as portrayed here, a complete waste, typically following Universal's attempts to make this monster a kiddy attraction. They forgot that the creature was fearsome when he had the mind of a murderer. This was all done better in House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula, where the climax in those two films was the re-animation of the Frankenstein monster, feared by all and second to no other supernatural creature. The werewolf/vampire battle looks like a rip-off of Howling 6: the Freaks, where it was also done better and on a smaller budget.  And for well-written, well-acted, and literate monster film making, clearly the Hammer films still are the best and likely will be for many years to come.  Let's hope that they don't dust off the Creature from the Black Lagoon for this type of re-make!",Null,0,1,12 May 2004
The Butterfly Effect," A cynical 'Wonderful Life', intellectually fit for butterfly minds.
","Hard to see why thousands would vote this a 10, except that there's a lot of AK groupies out there, plus a bunch of witless sophomores who eat up this type intellectually vapid material as if it were pablum. Having now seen it twice, two years apart, I can say that the first viewing was more impressive, and that had to do with it's rather unique presentation of the worn-out time travel plot. The second time it became apparent that this was meant to be viewed only once by anyone with any sensibility. In fact, it is a decent metaphor for AK himself in that it is nice-looking but there seems to be very little substance. Too many scenes that either made no sense or were basically not believable even in the realm of science-fiction/fantasy. A lot of nonsensical behavior and just plain idiotic moves made by our time-traveler, that nobody watching would have made. Much of this is likely due to what can be called relative immaturity of the director/writer, relative being a key term here. Most directors with some years on them would not have allowed such moronic behavior by the lead to remain in the script, nor would have created such stereotypical behavior by the characters, and also would have attempted to seal up the plot holes. This being the cynical age that it is, are we surprised to see a story that proposes that perhaps it is better for a person to not be born?

Ghost Rider," Not the best Marvel film adaptation, but a good one still.
","Of course it would be tough to exceed the level of X-men or Spiderman, or even come close, but regardless, it is nice to have the Marvel comic characters being made into enjoyable and watchable film versions, rather than those lame made-for-TV or animated series. Before the current group was created, the best Marvel film was Punisher with Dolph Lundgren, and that was a little better than mediocre film. This one is rather in the middle as far as being compared to all recent Marvel films, but that still means it's a good one. Nick Cage is a superb Ghostrider, and it's hard to imagine anyone else doing so well with it. The supporting cast is fine, and of course the effects are super. though it may have weak points, it moves along at a pace that lets you pretty much forget about them. Marvel fans won't want to miss this and others will probably like it as well. Don't expect it to be one of the best Marvel films ever done and you'll not be disappointed.",Null,1,1,10 June 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not up to 1 or 2 regardless of fabulous visuals.
","I would have been more generous with the rating, but for this entry being much lesser one than the first or second. I suspect some of the problem is that the director of one and two passed on three to do the Superman Returns movie. I think that was a mistake, for the X-Men have much more interesting characters than the Superman series, since the Superman producers have not seen fit to bring in the other great villains, like Brainiac, and left things be with only Lex Luthor. At any rate, this version of X-men I found to be quite entertaining as far as the basic plot and the visuals were concerned, but I didn't feel that the newer X-men were as strongly developed as they should have been. Especially since they saw fit to kill off Cyclops early on, what was that about? Did the actor want out of the series? Some of the most painful moments came due to really silly adolescent dialog, like the President saying, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. That was just a stupid use of a trite, outdated stereotype. And the President, what a geezer! Tha last time the US really had a president like that was before FDR, even Reagan appeared and behaved more youthful. Also, I am really tired of Magneto's megalomania, as if his wartime experience should excuse him. The best thing in this whole outing was seeing him reduced to mere mortal status. It should have been left that way with him playing chess with all the other retirees, and maybe making some human friends, and learning how to get over his hatred. Come on, don't let this series slip into the Superman-style dead end of one villain.",Null,1,2,25 June 2007
Event Horizon," What happens when Jr High nerds are given millions to make a movie.
","Got this on a still sealed LD, and I should have left it sealed and sold it. This terrible excuse for a scary sci-fi movie features such witty dialog as: S*** and F***, and then more and more of the same. It has such intelligent characters as a Dr/engineer who cannot explain anything scientific, a captain who only can lament and complain, and lacks any qualities of leadership, a crew that must have gotten their intellects out of a cracker jack box. It is chock full of great junk comic book science like: The law of relativity says we can't travel the speed of light, as if they really understand relativity, and of course there must be the relativity cops on patrol, too. How about this great junk science theory: All we have to do to travel in space is to fold space like a page out of a girlie mag, and there we are! Right, every physicist knows that the third dimension is really only the second dimension in disguise, waiting to be folded. It's the kind of science every thirteen year old wishes were true. And then, this most horrible, evil dimension, hiding like a weasel behind a black hole, that gave life to the Event Horizon, looks like second-rate Hellraiser out-takes not scary enough to be left in. I was guessing whoever concocted this pile of bird droppings must be about 13 yrs old, but of course no studio would give millions to a kid on a lark, would it? So it must be the IQ that's 13.

Mulholland Drive," Not Lynch's best, but still better than most other Hollywood stuff...
","The wonderful visual touches and peculiar dramatic devices that are expected of Lynch are all here and make this film rise greatly above its relatively simplistic story, and that includes some fabulous acting.There's nothing in the film, and no scene, that does not have something to do with the main drama of a woman spurned by her lover who then has significant emotional and mental disturbances. One commenter defies anyone to be able to explain all parts or scenes of this film, and I would take that challenge. It is not all that difficult when viewed as imagined events interspersed with reality, and as an exploration of an emotionally ill mind. A viewing of the film from beginning to end is necessary however.While not my favorite Lynch film, it's so much better than most drivel out of Hollywood that it is highly recommended viewing, and will captivate the viewer such that the running time is barely noticeable. It is the type of film that ends and yet you wish it hadn't. Of particular note is a marvelous rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' by a female singer.",Null,0,1,29 June 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Putrid potboiler glorifying gangsterism with comic book characters
","This has got to be Tarentino's worst and hopefully it will stay that way. This is nothing more than a hyped-up one-dimensional trip down every type of cliché in comic book and kung fu movie history. There's nothing here that resembles any sort of humanistic vision, moreso it's only what is less evil than what else. It's fatalism at it's worst, with a nihilistic vision of humanity. It celebrates the rotton core of the criminal mind. It says that those who kill are the wonders of the world, to be admired and emulated. The rest of us folks who don't are bumbling, dim-witted buffoons. This is what can be expected from an individual who was mindlessly inundated with senseless psycho horror films, cheesy outlandish Kung Fu crud, simplistic comic book story lines, all of these saying that gore is good, might makes it right, and everything human can be explained in a one-dimensional characterization. Those who rave about how great this is, do so merely because it is an extremely slick presentation, completely realized pulp novel, and is just as empty-headed as all of those pulp novels that have long gone into trash incinerators and landfills where they belong. This is violence only for the sake of violence, without any of the nuance and subtlety of the great film storytellers, such as Hitchcock or Kurosawa, who knew that a small dose or a mere hint of violence was all that was necessary to augment a good story.",Null,14,28,20 July 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Glaring illogic and way too many climaxes
","Those who watch this after reading the book will think it's just fine, but that's because there's a fair bit of information that is in the book, not in the film, that gives readers an overview that helps to understand the film. Those who haven't read the book will find many of the plot twists confusing, and will have a hard time discerning between the protectors of the Holy Grail, and those out to destroy it. There several plot contrivances that are plainly illogical.For example, we are supposed to believe that, in the very short time between the initial murder and the arrival of the investigators, the lead investigator was contacted by his bishop and told, falsely, that the murderer had confessed to the bishop and who the murderer was.BUT...this information had to come from somebody who'd seen the murder scene BEFORE the police did, and then passed this scene info on to the bishop WITH the intent of creating a cover-up, all done because the victim had written the falsely accused killer's name on the floor before he died.EXCEPT...that what the victim wrote was to contact this person (for help), NOT that this person 'is my killer'!Come on now! This is almost as illogical as the people in horror films who go ahead and investigate a noise the basement when they know for a fact that a psycho is on the loose in the area. And this is only one of several inconsistencies! Plus there are at least 4 separate climactic moments in the last 30 minutes. If this hadn't come from Ron Howard and the big Hollywood movie machine, it would have been panned terribly rather than getting mostly mediocre reviews on average. However it does have great art direction and cinematography, and very good performances in general.",Null,0,2,14 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Essentially a re-do of Part 2, misses some marks, but still good...
","I actually enjoy this third installment, but I liked the second one much better. About 3/4 of this one is a grander and bigger version of what happened in Part 2, with the other 1/4 being new stuff along with the continuation of Frodo's mission.The series is full of grandeur and morality that rivals any other film, but it is also derivative of other fantasy films in ways that are not merely coincidental, and is sometimes contradictory regarding the moral messages it conveys. in particular the messages regarding war and death with honor.I think Part 3 missed the mark by bumping off Chris Lee so soon, and not allowing any sort of redemption for Gollem. It was obvious that would be a problem since he had murdered a friend to gain the ring, but it could have been done. As it was, the only scene of redemption was when the dead, disgraced soldiers returned for battle, and that was only so they could get something in return, not really any sort of redemption as they had nothing to lose in the fight and couldn't be killed again. So Part 3 was lacking in this regard.A very good film, often great, but not the best picture of the year.",Null,0,2,29 April 2008
The Thin Red Line," Exceptionally good but not as great as the hype.
","For some, it's simply a matter of placing a war in a context of moral equivalence, angst, and adding the always asked and never answered (by such films), What is war? What is it's purpose? What is right and wrong?, and the war film becomes and instant classic according to those who call themselves anti-war advocates. These questions are asked here in a variety of ways and a multitude of juxtaposed images. Had everyone in WWII been as involved with the soul searching of the several combatants here, it's possible that we might have had a different outcome, or the same outcome in a different way, if you can imagine the leaders of the Allies doing the same sort of ruminating. The best points of this whole exercise are made in two scenes. One, when the Colonel, Nick Nolte, relieves the Lt. of command, and it's clear that the Lt. would have saved his men yet lost the battle, and Nolte is the type of officer that won this war in both the Pacific and in Europe. The other is the scene of the men prodding the crocodile to get it to open it's mouth, and it just stares with it's terrifying eyes. That one shot contrasted with all of the beautiful shots of other natural creatures and scenery is enough to show in visuals what was said by the colonel about nature when he described the vines winding around all of the trees, and choking them. But the film's low point is it's portrayal of most of the Japanese soldiers as being without much courage nor strength of character, a total falsehood and a sadly bigoted point of view.",Null,1,2,5 August 2006

","Sadly, this entry in the Marvel comic book heroes to movie adaptations is the weakest of the lot, made for kids with cardboard, stereotyped characters. And what's worse is that Fantastic Four was the premier Marvel super hero group of all back in the day. Every Marvel fan was eagerly anticipating this in hopes that it might equal the X-men or Spiderman series, or at least come close. Alas, it is merely lukewarm at best. How could there be so much great character development in X-men and Spiderman in a mere two hours, and such lack of it here? Why is there no grand hero activity to enthrall us, except for the resolution of the bridge mishap, which was all caused by the Thing in the first place! Anyone who knows anything about comic book lore knows that George Lucas based Darth Vader on the great Dr Doom of the comic book fame. Better to watch Vader again than this poor hammy excuse of Doom.
