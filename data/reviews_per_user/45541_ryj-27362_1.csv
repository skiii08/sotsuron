Hereditary," Although it can feel drawn out and irrelevant at some points. It pays off with it's respectable acting, and beautifully peiced together, memorable ending.
","I went into watching this open minded. After watching (or experience??) 'The Babadook'. pyschological thrillers have captivated me. This movie in particular is less of a mind boggling experience, and more of an emotional puzzle. It can feel a bit awkward in terms of camera angles/shots and certain director choices. I often felt like they brought alot of extra plot points into the movie without quite adding a fitting conclusion. You're left trying to peice together every plot point, yet some of this mocie just didn't feel neccesary. Aside from it's mildly drawn out scenes it has it's stamp in cinema as a emotionally intense family drama/Thriller that'll leave your hand cusping your mouth in attempt to hold back the sigh of astonishment.",7,0,1,1 December 2018
