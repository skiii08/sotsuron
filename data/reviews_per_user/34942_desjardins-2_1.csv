",Bravo Bravo Bravo What a movie. Finally a movie worth the price and worth sitting through. I could have watched another 2 hours. I am not a Johnny Cash fan but have now become one mainly due to Phoenix and Reese's vocals . I thought they were both very good. When I saw Joaquin in the Folsom Prison sequence it was like being there . But I have mainly become a Phenix and Reese fan.What chemistry these two bring to the screen.Electrifying. My favourite movie of all times. Better than Ray because they did their own vocals. Imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch the Academy Awards expecting Reese and Phoenix to win only to lose to that guy in Capote. Please give me a break Joaquin was much much better and more believable. This movie shows a man through much poverty addiction & a lot of pain over losing his brother but yet he manages to be mean and vulnerable. How this movie got left out for movie of the year is beyond me. But at least the Golden Globes got it right by rewarding both Phoenix and Reese and the movie.Academies are out for me a joke as far as I'm concerned.Can't wait to see these actors in their next role. Preferrably together the years of Cash and Carter 1968 till the end.,10,1,2,19 April 2006
