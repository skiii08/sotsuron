Deja Vu," An overall good film
","A very good thriller with an amazing concept. It is very good film and enjoyable to watch with some very good acting, however it does contain some slow motion scenes that do feel a little corny compared to the rest of the film. The film however is still worth watching and this does not affect how good the film as a whole. This means my overall score is 9/10 and is definitely worth watching.",9,0,0,18 April 2017
The Dark Knight," The best Batman film to date
","This film, in my opinion, is one of the best batman films to date. This has an amazing plot, great characters and acting. Heath Ledgers is amazing in this film his Joker is serious and sinister. His overall character has this air of insanity. Christian Bales Batman fits the grittier and more serious nature of this Batman film. The plot is carefully crafted and keeps viewers interested. In my opinion, this movie seamlessly combines the all the plot lines and side plots with the main plot. In my opinion, this is the best Batman film to date with great acting and plot.",9,0,1,24 April 2017
