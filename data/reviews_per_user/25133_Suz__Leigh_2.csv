First Man," No joy
","This movie was not about the events that led up to the first step on the moon, but rather a depressing view of Neil Armstrong's life. I felt like a group of dementors were hovering above me since, instead of euphoria, particularly toward the end of the movie, I felt like all the joy had been sucked out of me. The characters were morose and the camera work left me nauseous. This movie could have been a great telling of a monumental moment in history, but I suspect it will go down in movie history as a second or third rate biopic.",3,12,20,19 October 2018
The Legend of 1900," Beautiful, moving
","I am rarely moved to go out and find the DVD of a film I've just seen, however, I will be buying this one. Like many other commenter's, I stumbled across this work of art while channel surfing (I missed the first 20 minutes or so), and was immediately captivated.The movie is ROTFL funny (the 'jazz-off'), moving (the girl, the music), and insightful. Tim Roth was inspiring as was the music which absolutely deserved the Golden Globe Best Score. Tornatore succeeded in drawing me into the life of this ship and the heart of this gentle and charming man. To all who gave this film to us who live beyond the 88 keys... well done!",10,0,2,10 July 2005
