Casablanca," Not the greatest...
","After being told time, and time again that this was the greatest film ever made, I had very high hopes. I was excited to see THE film everyone always talks about. After having watched Casablanca, I was depressed that I did not find within it whatever qualities that others have found such reverence for. Perhaps more viewings will reveal it to me in the future, but I've seen this film five times already (as of this writing) and each time I'm left with the same feeling: it's a very good, well-written film, but less than the greatest film ever made. I would not blame anyone for disagreeing with my assessment, but in my reviews, I always strive to be honest and consistent within my own beliefs.",6,3,8,7 November 2012
Citizen Kane," Stumped
","For once, I'm stumped as to how to review a movie. When the movie's widely hailed as the greatest ever made and infiltrated your culture for the past seventy years and influenced nearly every movie you've ever seen, it's hard to say much that hasn't been said. Overall, it's a great film and certainly worth seeing. But at the same time, it's not for everybody. I think a film for everybody must be action packed, but at the same time slowly paced. It must be mainstream, and at the same time art house. It must be a horror, western, sci-fi, porno etc, and at the same time evoke all senses, yet leave people comfortable. I think most people are afraid to say bad things about Citizen Kane. It is a very well made movie, but I found it boring a times.",6,4,9,11 December 2012
Taxi Driver," Okay
","The script of 'Taxi Driver' is built like a diary, the diary of a very ordinary guy who gets hired as a night taxi driver back from Vietnam, because he can't sleep at night. A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation, but can't. The graphic and disturbing images of a man who lost his mind, control, and morals. It wasn't awful I'll give it that but I feel that labeling it as a cinematic masterpiece is a bit much. The character is interesting and we get to see the loneliness become companion to his psychosis and eventually evolve into a psychopathic violent explosion, but to what end? What was the point of the film? Overall it was entertaining. But would I recommend it? Most likely, no.",6,0,4,11 December 2012
The Graduate," Excellent
","There's not much more I can say about this film other than AWESOME. I absolutely loved it. This film makes me wish I had grew up in the 60s. It just seems so cool and funky. I'll start by saying Dustin Hoffman played his part perfectly. He played an accurate out-of-college student who thinks a little differently than most. Mrs. Robinson who is played by Anne Bancroft is smart, beautiful, and crafty. The story is wonderfully told with the help of Simon & Garfunkel, whom I love. The music fits the feel of the movie very well, very 60s. Another thing I loved was Katharine Ross who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. Katharine Ross is a beautiful person who I would certainly drive great lengths for.",8,0,0,11 December 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Good, if you're a musical person...
","I'm not in to musicals. Never have been, most likely never will be. The only musical film I semi-enjoyed was Moulin Rouge. As for Singin' in the Rain, It's okay. I expected more from such a highly revered film. It is about 30 minutes of plot (an extremely weak one, at that) stretched out far past it's limits. It seems as though the plot was just a feeble device to string together a bunch of dance sequences - dance sequences that repeat the same moves over and over. Impressive, but repetitive. This movie is all show. I think Hollywood overestimates how interested people are in movies about music, or even movies about Hollywood. Maybe it was wrong for me to hope for anything deeper than surface-level gloss. But I did. And I was pretty disappointed.",6,1,3,11 December 2012
Pulp Fiction," Awesome
","It's difficult to point out exactly what makes Pulp Fiction one of the best motion pictures in existence. It just is. The brilliant writing, the spot-on cast, the simple plot with the unpredictable turns - all combined with the calm and contrasting atmosphere that characterizes Tarantino's work - all adds up to nothing less than one of the most flawless drama of all time. In particular, the scene at Jack Rabbit Slims is my favorite. It's just a fun scene Steve Buscemi plays a laughable Buddy Holly server, and John Travolta can't get over how there could be a five dollar shake. Also before Uma Thurman and John Travolta enter the restaurant, Uma say, 'Don't be a square.' I don't think many viewers understand what that means because the term was popular in the 60s. It means don't be un-hip or uncool.",9,0,2,11 December 2012
Psycho," Love it...
","Psycho is a respected classic for being the first slasher film. Its great and you must respect it for starting a new breed of films. But it seemed to be a bit boring. Now I'm not saying its not great, but for a suspenseful movie it was boring. But it is a movie from the 60s so it is still pretty amazing for being a classic. Plus the acting is great and Anthony Perkins does an amazing job presenting himself , he is just chilling to the bone. All critique aside, I love this film. In particular, the shower scene. It is easily one of the most chilling horror scenes of all time, and I'm sure audiences who first viewed it were floored. It is so effective because the viewer never sees the knife actually penetrating the victim's skin. Its all left to your imagination.",7,0,0,11 December 2012
