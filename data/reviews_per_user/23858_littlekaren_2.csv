The Ring," Deliciously creepy
","I've been watching and reading horror for more years than I care to remember. I don't scare easily. No nightmares from Silence of the Lambs, none of that (okay, the book Red Dragon, same author, was verry scary). I found The Ring to be deliciously creepy, dark, moody, plot twists and turns and quite impossible to forget. A true horror flick!",8,1,1,10 December 2003
28 Days Later...," Love/Hate
","28 Days Later is the kind of movie where you simultaneously think it's brilliant and yet not. The beginning was way too slow in setting the scene, which I disliked. In the first 5 minutes I figured what was happening and have seen those 'wandering the streets' scenes before in On The Beach. Then it did borrow heavily from Omega Man whereas I thought it'd be more Night of the Living Dead. There were many disturbing scenes. When the group I was with left the theater, it was, like, 'what the heck was that?' Yet, undeniably thought provoking, nightmarish, and quite well done.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
