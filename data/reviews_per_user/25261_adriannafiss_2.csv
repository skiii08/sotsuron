The Princess Bride," My fav
","My favorite movie of all time, hands down. I watched it for the first time in the theatre. As it ended, the audience sat motionless and quiet for several beats, then burst into loud applause as the ending credits rolled. I'm not always so prophetic, but I was incredibly moved. I said to my husband, 'We've just seen the Academy Award winner.' If I had no other basis for recommendation, I would say the breathtaking cinematography and transporting musical score would make a viewing worthwhile . But these are merely the window dressings. The screenplay is enchanting. Also, without an understanding of the historical times, it would be too easy to say simplistically that this is a woman trying to live within the terms of a marriage of convenience and then compensating with pursuit of a doomed passion. What was crafted out of a mishmash of a more-or-less factual account is still a beautiful love and adventure story.",10,1,2,23 August 2007
