United 93," Unbelievable
","This is a movie that tends to shake you out of your everyday complacency and make you take note of what is going on in the world. You get a very good view of the emotions and actions that the writer perceives the hijackers to have had. You see the same thing in all the people who were on the flight. The insight into what happens at the ARTCCs at each major air center was very realistic. Fear everywhere. Interesting political commentary is weaved into this movie. It would be virtually impossible to leave this movie without having been moved, having thought a little deeper, and having realized that you too have the power to be extraordinary, just as the people on the flight were truly courageous. Absolutely amazing, gripping, shattering.",10,2,6,29 April 2006
