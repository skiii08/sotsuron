Kill Bill: Vol. 2," In the Top IMDb 250? 8+ Stars? Insanity.
","Since I believe this 'movie' should be avoided at all cost as a major waste of your time there's no need to give any summary. Although what is worth mentioning is how ridiculously boring, tedious, and pointless this so-called movie really is. I just finished watching Kill Bill vol. 2 and I am in a state of disbelief over how anybody could find this movie entertaining. Somebody please tell me the appeal of near endless, mindless dialog with a great deal of it being completely pointless. Anti-entertaining is the best way I can think of to describe it. I was looking for a little entertaining while laying on my bed home from work sick with the flu, but this 'movie' isn't just a disappointment because its not entertaining, it goes beyond that to induce an actual level of misery. Bad movies simply are not entertaining, thus this movie is worse than bad. Its so over-the-top pointless, and don't get me wrong there is about 20 solid minutes altogether of at least SOMETHING worth watching. But its so outweighed by the vast majority of unnerving nothing-ness that is the rest... well just picture an elephant and a feather on opposing ends of a balancing weight scale. The dialog is so bad you would be better off sitting in the park listening to two strangers converse about anything thats not kill bill 2, then to subject yourself to the torture that is kill bills (a good movie) sequel. I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and I gave this movie every benefit of the doubt all the way to the very end but it just kept getting worse. I thought maybe the 'movie' was building to a big amazing climax at the end since the whole thing was so slow and agonizingly boring.. But NOPE! the so-called climax of this film is the most boring, tedious, monotonous, painful 30 minutes or so of the whole 'movie,' maybe even film history all things considered. I read all these reviews of people saying what a masterpiece this film is. To each their own.. but that must be some kind of mass organized joke. No real sustained action period. Any fragments of what little action there is is outweighed a million-to-one by intense blaring boredom. Plot is irrelevant because before the you even hit 'play' its already known -Kill Bill. No real flow considering all the wacky pointless scenes with no bearing on the story at all. These pointless scenes can't have even one positive adjective attached to them, for example 'funny' or 'suspenseful' They are just nothing. Forgive my poor grammar in this review, it was typed quickly during a moment of passion, immediately following my first -and very much last- viewing of Kill Bill 2.Mindless talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk about nothing going nowhere with no point, forever is the legacy of Kill Bill vol. 2. Or least that of the worst sequel ever made in my humble opinion has a person who really liked the first one.",1,4,10,20 December 2010
