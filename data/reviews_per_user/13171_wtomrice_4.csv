Casablanca," What a love story!
","The best love story of all time.  Bogart has a presence in this movie that is unrivaled, and Bergman's angelic visage really adds to the magic of this movie.  I will never tire of this movie, as every frame is perfectly shot, every word spoken is magical.  The stars and moon were aligned in a way that made this movie one of the best of all time.",10,0,0,10 February 2001
Meet the Parents," Overhyped!
","Don't get me wrong; some parts of 'Meet the Parents' were very funny, but the movie as a whole seemed like a slow train wreck.I was waiting throughout the movie for Ben Stiller to be a man and stand up for himself while all of his girlfriend's family dumped on him.  I think his girlfriend was the most maddening character of all, not taking up for him and basically setting him up for failure.  She also let him sleep late, and wear his pajamas to the breakfast table, when everyone else was dressed and ready to go.  I would have drawn the line at the lie detector test, and walked out of the house, never to see any of that family (including his girlfriend) again.I had heard wonderful things about this movie from almost everyone I know, and to say the least, I was incredibly disappointed.",6,3,7,17 March 2001
Dead Poets Society," My favorite movie- it could change you if you let it!
","I don't cry very often in movies, but I cry every time near the end of this one. To show what a profound influence literature and free thought can have on young minds is priceless, and to tie in the passion of Thoreau, Whitman, Shakespeare and others makes this movie invaluable. I have seen it close to 50 times, and always feel as if I have just watched it for the first time. Robin Williams is fantastic, and gives what I still consider the best performance of his career. Don't believe what some of the critics say about this movie (the main message of the movie is to think for yourself and be your own person!); watch it with an open mind and you could be changed forever.",10,4,7,17 January 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Smart comedy!
","What an unbelievably hilarious movie!!  Every time George Clooney opened his mouth and spoke with that unmistakable accent and diction, I cracked up! What a treat to see the respect the Coens had for Homer's classic story.This was one of the best times I have had in a comedy since 'Raising Arizona.'  Since the Coens seem to recycle actors/actresses in their movies (John Goodman, Holly Hunter), I hope that George Clooney will be in future movies by these great comic directors.",10,0,0,10 February 2001
