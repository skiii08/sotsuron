The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The best Twilight movie so far!
",I'm not going to go crazy with a long review. Everyone knows what Twilight is and most people already know of they love it or hate it. As a die hard fan of the books I had high expectations for the movies. The actors have matured immensely since the first movie and in my opinion they played their characters *perfectly* in this movie. I was blown away with how accurate this movie was in comparison to the book. I only noticed a few small differences which would probably go unnoticed to a normal Twilight fan. I mainly wanted to write this review to tell the fans to ignore the haters. Most of the bad reviews that I read on IMDb sound and look like they are written by people who didn't even see the movie. I was impressed by this movie and if you are a fan of any of the previous movies you will thoroughly enjoy this one.,7,5,11,22 November 2011
