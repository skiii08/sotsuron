Requiem for a Dream," Searingly intense (if propagandistic) film
","The performances here are great, sometimes shockingly so.  Ellen Burstyn disappears completely into her character--she's so authentic in this role that it chokes your heart.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly have never been this good (some would say they've never been good at all, before or since). Even Marlon Wayans, that goofiest of Wayanses, is unexpectedly touching in his key supporting role.Darren Aronofksy's technique is quite astonishing.  It's interesting (and heartening) to see how popular the movie's become with young people, as its chilly formalism has more in common with art-house provocateurs like Peter Greenaway than with all those flashy new talents who used to make music videos.  At the same time, the technical virtuosity never overwhelms the narrative; in fact, it tricks you into thinking the simplistic message is more profound than it is.  The rolling, nightmarish sequence leading to the film's climax, made even more feverish by Clint Mansell's incessant score, is so searingly intense that you may feel physically sick afterwards.  (At least, in the unedited version it is.)  It may be the most powerful and disturbing fifteen minutes ever put on film, and to deny its effectiveness, even as a propaganda tool, would be wrong.And a propaganda tool is exactly what it is.  As an anti-drug message film, it's nowhere near as sophisticated as `Trainspotting'; its message is writ far too large for that.  And as entertaining as the film's aesthetic elements are, the relentless moralizing can be wearying.  `Requiem for a Dream' puts its message into a box (in this case a refrigerator) and hits you over the head with it over and over again.Then again, the aesthetic elements are so strong that talk of thematic subtleties seems like carping.  And really, I wasn't bothered by the movie's obviousness so much, even if I did notice it.  Highly recommended, with the tiniest grain of salt.  9 out of 10.",9,0,0,7 April 2003
The Ring," Scary, but stupid and humorless too
","`The Ring' is a horror movie as slick and stylish as a music video--and as pretentious.  Sure the imagery is beautiful, but the approach is so self-important--and, more significantly, so humorless--that you feel like you're watching a Calvin Klein ad much of the time.  To be fair, `The Ring' can be terribly scary, especially for a movie rated PG-13.  The movie does have the quality of a genuine nightmare, even if the techniques used to achieve that effect are overly self-conscious and obvious.  And, with the exception of the first scene, it resists the temptation to be yet another ripoff of `Scream.'Unfortunately, it's a ripoff of just about every other horror movie ever made, though I'm sure Gore Verbinski would prefer to think of it as an `homage.'  Tomato/tomahto; call it what you will, but there are direct visual quotations from at least ten and probably more like fifteen or twenty classic horror films.  As a scary movie buff, I found it distracting and annoying: `Oh, that's from When a Stranger Calls,' and `Oh, that's from The Omen,' and `Oh, that's from The Shining,' and `Oh, that's from The Changeling.'  Verbinksi obviously studied the genre meticulously before making this movie; it's just too bad he couldn't come up with some original ideas instead of recycling other people's into a relentless shock-movie mélange.  At times I felt like I was watching a new version of `Terror in the Aisles.'It doesn't help that the story is preposterous.  I won't give away any spoilers here, but I will say that every plot development is head-bangingly dumb, and it gets boring after a while.  Now I realize we're talking about a horror movie here, and so a little suspension of disbelief comes with the territory.  And maybe if the movie could laugh at itself a little bit, I'd be inclined to forgive its faults.  But it has all the dull gravity of the most excruciating art-house `masterpiece' you ever saw, and that doesn't help it one bit.Performances are OK; the only real standout is David Dorfman as the kid; he kind of looks like one of the orphans from `The Cider House Rules' would after spending a year at the bottom of a lake.  Gratuitous underwear scene aside, Naomi Watts doesn't show much of the promise she did in `Mulholland Drive,' and Brian Cox and Jane Alexander are pretty much wasted.But the point of a horror movie is to be scary, and, like I said, the movie does that pretty well in places.  If you can stomach its stupidities and other problems, you'll probably be entertained.  6 out of 10.",6,0,1,21 March 2003
Chinatown," Polanski at his most expressive
","Pastiche of classic noir is perhaps one of Polanski's warmest and most expressive films. Calling it a pastiche should not suggest that the director's unmistakable stylistic stamp is lacking; indeed, the unusual pacing, realistic texture, and vivid (if not always pleasant) characterizations are all there. But this time, the director's affection for his source material is so evident, and so genuine, that we see a less chilly, less gritty Polanski than we have before, and that's why 'Chinatown' is likely to appeal even to viewers who dislike his other pictures. The wonderful design helps a lot--the movie's bathed in rosy light--and the script and score aren't too shabby either. Performances are very fine, with a pre-superstardom Jack Nicholson in top form, and with John Huston using his considerable charm to create a memorable, grotesque comic portrait. 8.5 out of 10.",8,1,3,12 May 2003
Meet the Parents," Not entirely successful
","Unusual but not entirely successful feel-bad comedy. At first glance, 'Meet the Parents' seems to be a hybrid of Blake-Edwards-style farce and uninspired mainstream movie comedy (sort of like every movie Steve Martin has made in the past 15 years). But before long we realize it's actually much crueler than that  unlike those essentially safe entertainments, which are always rather boringly humane in their treatment of their characters, this film isn't afraid to get ugly. Its poor protagonist may not be particularly likable (and Ben Stiller's performance doesn't help a lot where that's concerned), but he nevertheless gains our sympathies because of the incessant, unreasonable series of tortures it rains down on him. It parades ugly character after ugly character in front of him, but unlike ridiculous farce figures such as Martin Short's Franck in the 'Father of the Bride' series, these people are all too believable, the kinds of smug hypocrites we encounter all too often in life (and that includes Focker's fiancée, actually). That's sort of where the problem comes in - the glitzy Hollywood veneer never really jells with the elements of real pain, and we never particularly want to see Stiller accepted into this family. Worse than that, the film's not consistently funny, though of course it is frequently appalling, and to some that's going to be close enough. 6.5 out of 10.",6,1,3,21 December 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Passable zombie fare
","Passable zombie fare. Abandoning the overt political statement of the original doesn't really hurt the film much--to be honest, Romero's 'Dawn' was somewhat overdone in its anti-consumerist message, a 'Night of the Living Dead' writ too large. Zack Snyder's new version touches on politics only in passing, and concentrates instead on its action. It's not a perfect film by any standard--it's at least half an hour too long, and many of the characters are poorly defined (star players Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames are pretty much wasted in their ostensible lead roles). Worst of all is the tired familiarity of the material--its one real innovation is having the living dead move quickly, and even that was done before in the messy '28 Days Later . . . .' But it's basically likable, with well-managed scare setpieces, and occasional witty touches (of which Johnny Cash's end-of-the-world anthem 'The Man Comes Around' is a particularly nice one). In the end, 'Dawn of the Dead' is a basically entertaining, if not terribly memorable, horror film. 6.5 out of 10.",6,0,0,8 November 2004
Finding Nemo," Enjoyable
","Pixar recaptures the charm of its earlier films after the disappointing `Monsters, Inc.'   All the inevitable trademarks are there--busy visuals, talky screenplay, Ratzenberger cameo--but we find that no matter how much we expect it to, this new breed of family film simply refuses to wear out its welcome.  Of course the look of the film is stunning, and the attention to ichthyological detail is admirable, too.  But what keeps the viewer hooked (um, as it were) is not any of these elements (nor the overstated if-you-love-somebody-let-them-go theme), but rather the visual and verbal wit (including several great cinema in-jokes), as well as a frankly crazy approach, and a welcome willingness to be scary.  I was reminded more than once of Jim Henson's Muppets in their heyday.  Quite enjoyable.  8 out of 10.",8,0,1,5 January 2004
The Others," Another disappointing 'twist' movie
","Yet another movie that seems to believe a good twist at the end can make up for a multitude of sins.  This one is little more than poor man's Shyamalan, though it takes for its inspiration `classy' horror movies like `The Innocents,' `The Haunting,' and `The Changeling' instead of the pulp that fuels M.N.S.'s celluloid nightmares.  And certainly `The Others' can't be faulted for poor taste.  On the contrary, it approaches its Gothic subject matter with great sobriety--it has whispers in the dark, and mysterious footsteps upstairs, and a sinisterly knowing staff, and a fog so unvarying that you wonder why anybody's the least bit worried about sunlight. Unfortunately, because this straightfaced approach doesn't coincide with any particular directorial style or verve, it only serves to make the creaky haunted-house subgenre feel even creakier.  None of the characters are particularly well developed (Alakina Mann at least gives a performance that's convincing, bratty, and fun, but Nicole Kidman, whose two modes of line delivery here are Severe Hiss and Severe Shout, has been almost as overrated for this as she was for `Moulin Rouge').  When the twist comes, it's certainly a good idea, but then the script has to go and explain it and explain it and explain it.  And the biggest problem is the same with this as it often is with Shyamalan--it's all too obvious the twist came first, and then all the rest of it was just shoveled in more or less haphazardly.  To be fair, `The Others' is never laughable or unbearable, exactly, but it never gets all that scary either, and it's disappointing to think what a good creepy movie might have been built (even working backwards) from this particular twist premise.  6 out of 10.",6,1,2,29 March 2004
Insomnia," OK, TV-movie-ish thriller
","There's a knotty ethical paradox at the heart of `Insomnia.'  What is the point of integrity if it keeps you from doing important work?  Would you sacrifice it to continue doing that work--even if it meant letting a cold-blooded killer go free?Unfortunately, this intriguing question comes clothed in pretty routine murder-mystery drag.  In fact, it's almost as if the screenwriters planted a single kernel of good idea, and then just shoveled in `Murder, She Wrote' filler around it.Performances range from good (Al Pacino and Robin Williams) to middlin' (Maura Tierney) to poor (Hilary Swank, in yet another inexplicably amateurish turn) to excruciatingly awful (the actors playing Dead Girl's Boyfriend and Dead Girl's Best Friend, who shall remain nameless, for their own protection).  And am I the only one who feels that Martin Donovan seems bizarrely out of place in anything but Hal Hartley movies?Christopher Nolan's much touted talent with a camera here boils down to a) gorgeous, generic establishing shots of Alaskan wilderness, and b) rapid-fire editing and `subliminal' shots so cheesy would make William Castle blush.  Yet another case of The Emperor Has No Clothes.Still, the scenes between Pacino and Williams in the film's middle section are gripping, and provide a glimpse of the fascinating, `Sleuth'-esque thriller this might have been.  And, to be fair, the movie never entirely loses you, even when you're shaking your head at the TV-movie-ness of it all.  6 out of 10.",6,0,1,14 April 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," At best dopey, at worst offensive
","Dopey, borderline offensive trash. The first half of the film is basically an excuse to unleash massive destruction on major American cities, but events of the past four years have robbed such an effort of a lot of the thrill and potential humor. Not that it would be terribly funny anyway, at least not in this director's hands. The disaster epics of the 1970s had their tongues firmly in cheek, and their ability to laugh at themselves allows even the most intelligent viewer to forgive a lot of excess. Roland Emmerich, on the other hand, approaches his story not with high seriousness, but with a kind of embarrassing TV-movie earnestness that's even worse. The fact that the hoariest of movie clichés are here intended to be genuinely heartwarming is a little pathetic, and doesn't jibe at all with the fanboyish cyberviolence of the movie's first act. Getting back to that violence, I'll never understand why these sorts of FX-travaganzas are always shot in the most unrealistic, unfrightening ways possible. Wouldn't it be much scarier to see a tornado (or three, in this case) from the perspective of someone on the *ground*, someone whose life is threatened, then from someone in the air? Ridiculous. 1 out of 10.",1,1,3,8 November 2004
Match Point," Odd, clever film
","Odd, clever film, if a cold one. At first, it almost numbs the viewer with its frankly clichéd scenario of marriage for money and cheap adultery. This is stuff of melodrama  the production's emphasis on opera is no coincidence  and yet, surprisingly, Woody Allen chooses not to emphasize the emotional aspects of his story, which might seem the best, or at least the most usual, way to make material like this work. Instead, he presents us with characters who aren't really even characterized  despite the over-the-top setting (it's amusing that critics called this a departure for Allen; it's true that here we get the Stately Homes of England instead of the Upper East Side, but it's still his same upper-class fantasy world), they're simply left to be dull, ordinary people, from naïve Chloe and her family to Nola, who, despite the magnetic effect she has on the men of the film, isn't really anything more than a typical stupid young American abroad, first trying to live a starving artist life (and succeeding too well for her liking) and then turning into a panicky, dependent child when she learns she's pregnant. Into this mix of un-characters comes Chris, a person so blank I had trouble remembering his name, about whom we learn nearly nothing over the course of the film. He's a foreigner who comes from humble beginnings (the others very Englishly nickname him 'Irish,' despite his successful downplaying of his accent) and yet we learn nothing of his background beyond his reasons for leaving pro tennis. It's (somewhat unbelievably) suggested that Chris is a great reader, but, like many real people, for the greater part of this story he is neither a thinker nor an actor. He accepts the affections of Chloe (and the privileges associated with them) more out of politeness than anything else, even to the point of marrying her; when Nola enters into the picture he acts, but still doesn't think. By the time he decides to murder his now-inconvenient paramour in an incredibly careless way (with a shotgun! in her flat!), we're strangely absorbed that such action could come from such a ho-hum character in such a ho-hum plot, and then shocked when he actually goes through with the killing, wondering how this unthinking, unclever, almost amoebalike character possibly thinks he can get away with it. Though similarly prettyboyish, Chris is neither a blood-lusting overachiever like Patrick Bateman or an I-just-wanna-be-loved sociopath like Tom Ripley  he hasn't the calculating ambitions (or the charm) of either, and it's hardly plausible that he could stumble out of his unpleasant situation as thoughtlessly as he stumbled into it. But stumble out of it he does  Allen's misanthropy extends to the entire world of this film, and just as Chris's frankly doltish wife is easily distracted from her husband's odd behavior, so too is the one police detective who manages to put the obvious clues together easily talked out of his theory by a chipper subordinate. Though not marketed as a comedy, 'Match Point' offers a coldly comic version of the world, and viewed in this light the film becomes almost paradoxically entertaining. Allen almost ruins it at the end with a twee bit of existential artifice that seems juvenile in the context of the adult tone to that point, but perhaps the oddest thing about 'Match Point' is how watchable a mix of not- pleasing-in-themselves elements it is. It's probably too clever for its own good by half, but it contains enough incongruity to surprise just about any viewer. 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,2,9 August 2006
MASH," Strange film
","Strange film; basically entertaining, but not exactly a masterpiece. One of the most likable things about Robert Altman is that every film of his has been in some way an experiment, and almost none of these experiments, even the very good ones, work perfectly. This is a great example. As is obvious from the many user comments here, it's difficult to talk about 'MASH' without comparing it to 'M*A*S*H,' and in fact the most important cultural thing the film may have done is establish an aesthetic universe for the TV series to exist in (and that really is the only thing the film and the TV show have in common  as many have pointed out, the tone, style, timing, and even character personalities are quite different between the two). But taken on its own, 'MASH' is not really the anti-war polemic it's been made out to be, nor is it the joke-driven movie comedy we might expect from the series' style. Instead, it's a kind of exercise in black-comic tone; it subverts the idea of war not by explicitly criticizing it, even through jokes, but rather by being exactly the opposite of what we expect a traditional war film to be. Here we don't see courage or valor or heroism or honor; we see cowardice and nastiness and vice and stupidity, even from the 'good' characters. The movie subtly suggests that war makes ordinary people into silly, stupid, and vicious ones, and Hawkeye and Trapper are no more exempt from this law than Frank Burns; in fact, if anything they are more angry and mean than he is. This unusual approach to the subject matter is well-maintained throughout the film, and never becomes too harsh or ugly  and yet Altman missteps with some oddly chosen episodes (Painless's 'suicide attempt,' for instance, and the overlong, if symbolic, football game), and the ending of the film is abrupt, making what's come before seem even more pointless and inconsequential. Which may be exactly Altman's point, of course . . . so here we have another Altman film that manages to be simultaneously witty, jokeless, boring, entertaining, confusing, beautifully thought out, artfully constructed and artless, symbolic and realistic. It's recommended, but viewers should ideally go into it with no expectations whatsoever. 7 out of 10.",7,47,78,28 December 2004
Alien," Chilly horror masterpiece
","A chilly horror masterpiece.  There's a meaty concept at play behind the spookhouse façade, a healthy--and slightly paranoid, in the best seventies sci-fi way--subtext about not trusting corporate and government establishments (here rolled into one in `the Company').  But mainly it's just a clammy horror movie, as the simple but well-drawn characters fumble around in the dark, alternately looking for the alien and running from it. Ridley Scott's technique is elegant, but we don't see as much of the stylistic polish (some would say pretense) here as we do in his later work. In this case, that's a blessing, as it gives the film an air of sweaty, almost `Das Boot'-like realism largely absent from his florid recent efforts.The `Alien' series has had quite a mythology grow up around it, and it isn't hard to understand why.  There isn't really another movie series quite like it, with each episode being guided by a different, competent and completely distinct auteur.  It is not a flawless series--there are those who find `Aliens' too macho and thuggish, `Alien³' too black and misanthropic, and `Alien Resurrection' too self-indulgent and empty (and, perhaps, too badly acted).  But each film is so unique, and yet has so much in common with the others (the opening `wake-up calls,' the androids, the Company, and most notably, of course, Sigourney Weaver's iconic Ripley), that it's safe to say there's been no more perfect genre series thus far.  This first film seems to be the only one everyone can agree on, and I can see no reason to argue with that.  9.5 out of 10.",9,0,1,4 November 2003
Elf," Nice performance from Ferrell raises this above average
","Affable, amusing holiday fare.  There's really nothing terribly new here--the film's basically a collection of Christmas-movie clichés strung together like Buddy's meticulously crafted paper snowflakes.  But Will Ferrell's deeply committed performance makes things worth our while. Ferrell seems to be that rarest of creatures, the `Saturday Night Live' alum who actually can make it on the big screen.  Here he gives a big, childlike, wonderfully straight-faced performance--he never winks at the audience, and that's what gives him his charm.  In fact, the entire production has a refreshing earnestness about it--there's nothing all that special about Jon Favreau's direction (though his quick cuts in the reindeer scenes preserve the illusion beautifully), but we have to admire the fact that there are no annoying pop-cultural references, grossout gags, or smarmy jokes for the adults to laugh at.  There aren't too many belly laughs, either, but unless you have a heart of stone, you're likely to have a smile on your face for the entire 95 minutes.  7 out of 10.",7,2,3,3 December 2003
Lost in Translation," Imperfect, but authentically sad
","Sofia Coppola's direction here is understated and sophisticated.  Her pacing occasionally resembles Atom Egoyan's--she's not at all afraid to take her time, introducing a new bit of information and then backing off to allow us to absorb it.  The performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, while never showy, do have a lovely, muted authenticity about them, and it's rare to see a film that captures the alienation of solitary travel so well.  But some may find that `Lost in Translation' suffers a bit from its resemblance to Mike Figgis's excellent `Leaving Las Vegas.'  While it's not nearly as explicit or melodramatic as that film was, the primary conceit--two lonely and very different people making a brief, beautiful human connection--is so similar that it's hard to watch it without making some tough comparisons. Perhaps the biggest difference is that Figgis's film had a script--Coppola's screenplay is deliberately low-key, yes, but there are times when the actors' small talk is all too obviously improvised, and we wish the director had taken more rehearsal time to develop the dialogue, as Robert Altman or Mike Leigh would have.  Others have mentioned Coppola's surprisingly reactionary take on Japanese culture (`lip my stocking'?), and it is troubling.  And the supporting performances of Giovanni Ribisi and Ana Farris produce absolutely zero interest, beyond serving as obvious ooh-are-they-really-Spike-and-Cameron gossip fodder.  Still, the truth behind the movie's sadness can't be denied, and its capture is no small achievement.  Recommended particularly for fans of understatement for its own sake.  7 out of 10.",7,0,0,16 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not a masterpiece, perhaps, but assured and entertaining
","An assured and entertaining vision of Tolkien's world.  If it is not quite the masterpiece many fans (and critics) have made it out to be, it is still a work of great integrity.  Peter Jackson and his team have been painstaking--sometimes frighteningly so--in their attention to detail.  If you haven't read the books since you were a child, I guarantee you'll experience shivers of recognition as those familiar names and images come flooding back.  And yet Jackson never allows the narrative to get bogged down by the pedantic fussiness that spoils some readers' experiences with Tolkien; nor does he ever let the special effects really run away with the show.  He seems to realize that to make an epic feel real, one must exercise a little restraint.  Very wise.And he's certainly helped along by his near-flawless cast of familiar character actors, perhaps the film's strongest element.  Standouts are Viggo Mortensen's moody Aragorn and Christopher Lee's ice-cold Saruman, but really all the male performances are excellent.Contrary to popular opinion, `Fellowship' is not without its problems, however slight.  The pacing lags here and there (the stopoff in Lothlórien, for instance, nearly cripples the film in its third act).  And the female performances (Liv Tyler's breathy Arwen and Cate Blanchett's steely Galadriel) are millimeters away from high camp.  Moreover, moviegoers who were more Jackson fans than Tolkien ones going in are bound to be a little disappointed.  Of course, his hand is obvious everywhere, and yet, largely on account of the somewhat stuffy subject matter, the film has neither the emotional depth of `Heavenly Creatures,' nor the wit and insane verve of `Braindead' and `Bad Taste.' 
But why carp?  Jackson has done what was thought to be impossible, creating a faithful, dramatic, accessible piece of entertainment out of Tolkien's esoteric magnum opus.  And, happily, the movie only improves on repeat viewing.  So enjoy.  (Oh, and for my money I prefer the extended DVD version--though you probably won't want to consume it all in one sitting). 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,0,24 February 2003
Cast Away," Surprisingly powerful
","I was not a Tom Hanks fan when I approached this movie.  Probably my favorite of his projects up to this point was `Bosom Buddies,' and, yes, that includes `Saving Private Ryan.'  I swore and threw stuff at my TV when he won his Oscars.  What in hell were people thinking, giving this guy awards for his saccharine, watery-eyed everyman schtick? This kind of acting belonged in ibuprofen commercials. Then I saw `Cast Away.'  I was nervous at first--although the prologue contained nothing overtly vomitous, it was still way too cute for my sensitive palate.  Cute, boring guy's cute, boring girlfriend thinks he works too much; he very cutely, very boringly tricks her into thinking he's not going to propose, etc.  Again, to the filmmakers' credit, the cute stuff was approached with a pretty subtle hand--but it doesn't take much to make me gag. Then the plane goes down, and the movie turns into something else: part silent film, part philosophical indie, part horror movie. The direction is really quite amazing, especially coming from Robert Zemeckis.  Who knew he had it in him, to combine such beautiful cinematography with such powerful imagery (the spear-fishing transition is an incredible movie moment), all in the context of what can only be thought of as an introspective non-story? Who knew that he was so tuned in to the power of silence?  Who knew that he, or anyone, could milk honest-to-God tears from a man keeping himself sane through his `friendship' with a volleyball?  There were times when I couldn't believe this thing had played in mainstream theaters, it was so quiet and strange and sad.  It had almost none of the usual crowd-pleasing crap, and that was beautiful. And yes, Tom Hanks is good, very good.  And I was ready for him to bomb, believe me.  I may have even smiled at the idea of him marooned on an island with no food.  (Where's your watering eyes now, Buffy?)  But he surprised me--his performance was completely subtle, and completely believable, and completely sad.  He probably should have gotten the Oscar this time. But of course it couldn't really last, and in the final act the cuteness does creep in again.  But it doesn't really matter.  You can't take that middle section away from me, and in this case that's enough. Much has been made out of the endless parade of FedEx logos, and you don't have to be a film-school graduate to notice (and laugh at) the over-the-top mise-en-scene.  But who really cares about that? All in all, the beginning and ending make my grade something of a compromise, but I definitely recommend checking this one out.  7.5 out of 10.",7,1,1,4 March 2003
The Thing," Formally perfect scary movie
","One of Carpenter's few true masterpieces. Reviled by critics at the time of its release, it's built a healthy cult following since then, but still suffers from a reputation as the ne plus ultra of alien splatter movies. It's a reputation that is both deserved and unfair--Rob Bottin's effects are certainly repulsive and shocking, even by today's standards, but they are few and far between, and that's actually what makes the movie so scary. 'The Thing' is a study in contrasts--long segments of unsettling quiet punctuated by sudden, brief blasts of grotesque horror. It's an approach that works beautifully--in fact, this may be the paranoid horror movie to end all paranoid horror movies, surpassing the superficially similar 'Alien' and even 'Night of the Living Dead' in its style and polish (if not its substance). The large cast of character actors is uniformly superb, with Wilford Brimley, Keith David, and Donald Moffat perhaps standing out. Bill Lancaster's screenplay is economical and convincing, resisting the urge to stereotype its characters or over-inflate its dialogue. While 'The Thing' is known for its humorlessness, to my ear the script plays like the bleakest and subtlest of black comedies, with its unexpected doses of hideous death, and its terrified, bickering scientists never managing to pull themselves together and solve anything. The lighting and slithery cinematography are magnificent, even for this director, and Ennio Morricone's score seems to be a conscious, clever imitation of Carpenter's own minimalist compositions. If pressed, I might complain that in this (as in most of his other films) Carpenter is too much of an aesthete, more interested in exercising his formal gifts than in saying anything. At the same time, I don't much care--Carpenter's rare dips into social commentary have been rather heavy-handed (see 'They Live' - just kidding, don't), and a perfectly scary film is still a perfectly scary film, deeper meaning or no. Enjoy. 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,14 January 2004
North by Northwest," A popcorn masterpiece
","A popcorn masterpiece that continues to impress.  Sure, it's a little bit dated, and it doesn't have the depth of some of Hitchcock's other work.  But it remains one of his grandest entertainments.  People usually talk about `Jaws' as the first modern movie blockbuster, but I think an argument could be made for this movie as well.  The larger-than-life approach to the material works beautifully, and the mind-game premise, ambitious set pieces, and naughty script hold up very well indeed.  The off-hand performances add to the fun too, and it's not just the leads who are good.  You also get fun work from Sergeant Emile (`Emile?') Klinger, from the fat cop who has to listen to Eve playing dumb (`Did you find your Mr. Thornycroft?'  `Thornhill, ma'am.'), and, especially, from Martin Landau's bitchy Leonard, one of the greatest minor characters in the history of the movies.  10 out of 10.",10,1,2,6 March 2003
The Exorcist," Aesthetics raise a pulpy story to beautiful heights
","The cosmology of `The Exorcist' is so conservative it's almost embarrassing--this story takes place in a world of absolute good and absolute evil, where the bad guys are supernatural monsters who attack children and the good guys wear black suits with white collars.  For all its legendary shock value, it's really about as subversive and blasphemous as a Sunday-school pageant, and in another director's hands, it could easily have verged into the preachy, campy territory that `Bless the Child' would explore almost thirty years later.  But William Friedkin works something of a minor miracle with his pulpy, didactic material.  Like Francis Ford Coppola did with `The Godfather,' he takes a fundamentally stupid and obvious story and uses style to transform it into something brilliant.  And truly, `The Exorcist' is an aesthetic marvel, with Friedkin's incredible sense of rhythm and timing apparent everywhere.  The early scenes establishing the characters are so flatly scripted, they might as well have no dialogue at all, but the director's detached, almost voyeuristic approach makes them seem authentic rather than clunky.  We feel we are seeing banal slices of these characters' lives, and that's what makes the introduction of the vulgar, loud, stylized demon so jarring.  In fact, the film works best as a study in contrasts--long scenes of great stillness are punctuated with moments of sudden violence and grotesqueness, and the result is not an effect of mere surprise, but real sensory horror.  Friedkin's use of sound is great too, not just in Mercedes McCambridge's famously foulmouthed performance, but in such sudden startling touches as a phone ringing, or something rustling in the attic, or a woman's voice suddenly speaking with a Greek accent.  (Both the sound and the unusual pacing suggest the Roman Polanski of `Repulsion' and `Rosemary's Baby.')  As for the acting, it's fine across the board, with Jason Miller standing out as the weary antihero Damien Karras.  Whether the film is scary seems to be much a matter of personal taste, but even if you aren't frightened, it's hard to deny the staggering beauty of the filmmakers' expression here.  10 out of 10.",10,1,2,8 December 2003
Before Sunset," Surprising
","I probably shouldn't be writing about 'Before Sunset,' since I haven't seen 'Before Sunrise,' and I don't even know much of its reputation. But I think even sequels should have stand-alone appeal, and I must confess I found this film to be a very pleasant surprise, even if it sometimes tried my patience. The idea of making a filmed version of a single conversation is sort of inherently uncinematic  I'm no great fan of 'My Dinner with André,' which as a piece of talk was occasionally interesting, but which never achieved anything as a film that it wouldn't have as a play, or, indeed, as an actual real-life conversation. I anticipated the same kind of problems here, and they are here  having these two chatterboxes move their bodies in and out of cafés and along the Seine is better than having them sit at a table the whole time, but it still doesn't really use the medium to its best advantage. The whole concept has the feel of a gimmick about it  and yet there's something about the film that really comes alive by the end of it. Jesse and Celine are not particularly interesting characters (even they make fun of each other's shallowness and irresponsibility), but there's something almost magical about the big 'what if?' that rests in the center of this confection. It's a common fantasy, the desire to know how life might have been different if one single day had gone the other way, and it's maybe a good thing that very few of us ever have the chance to find out. (For all the romance and warmth of the movie's resolution, the odds are even more stacked against ultimate togetherness for these characters than they would have been the first time.) But this uncertainty only adds to the substance, as these two ordinary but likable people romanticize their past and present (but not future). As I said, at times their catching up is a little tiresome, and yet the emotional payoff makes it worth the getting there, and the low-key performances from the two stars become a big part of the film's ultimate authenticity and success. 'Before Sunset' is a movie with a heart that sneaks up on even the most jaded viewer, and it has to be recommended for just about anyone. 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,0,13 January 2005
28 Days Later...," Collapses halfway through
","The movie opens quite elegantly. It's derivative, certainly, cannibalizing 'The Stand,' 'Dawn of the Dead,' and 'The Thing' (among others), but it takes itself quite seriously, and that's something. There are some genuinely disturbing moments early on--the walk through the eerily silent metropolis, Jim's first encounter with a jerking, hissing zombie, Selena's startling response to the attack on Mark. The plot is frequently implausible (taking Valium to help them SLEEP?), and the approach is occasionally tone-deaf, too (the jolly grocery-shopping scene is one embarrassing example), but overall it makes a more than respectable start.Unfortunately, it collapses about halfway through, bogging down in a boring and rather ugly new storyline that leads to a needlessly vicious climax. And, really, even at its best '28 Days Later . . .' never realizes its philosophical potential--the closest it gets is a throwaway conversation where Selena talks about the implications of the end of civilization. Jim basically shrugs it off, as do the filmmakers. Horror movies don't often achieve much depth, of course, but this one doesn't even have the sinister wit of Danny Boyle's previous effort'Shallow Grave,' and I think this might finally prove the theory that this director is only as good as his screenwriter. While I can't deny that here he shows just how gorgeous digital video really can be, unfortunately his self-conscious composition too often gets in the way of the story, especially early on (when there still is a story to get in the way of).Performances are basically likable (especially Cillian Murphy in the lead), except for 'Shallow Grave' veteran Christopher Eccleston, who's wasted in his one-note role. Overall, it's probably worth a watch for fans of the genre, but you won't want to see it again. 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,22 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Competent but dull, or dull but competent?
","There are some tremendously exciting fight scenes in `The Two Towers'; in fact, it's probably Peter Jackson's most excitingly choreographed work since `Braindead.'  Most of the cast reiterate the fine performances they gave in the first film, and there are some nice additions, particularly Brad Dourif's hammily rotten Grima Wormtongue.  The production as a whole is as focused and thorough and poker-faced as we've come to expect from this team.But unfortunately, we find that much of the fun we had in the first film has drained away.  `The Fellowship of Ring,' for all its critical overpraise, worked in the same way a BBC children's miniseries would--the plot was simple and episodic, but it was always on the move, with our young heroes and their British-character-actor friends and foes tumbling from one scrape to another.  It was good childlike fantasy fun from beginning to end. `The Two Towers,' on the other hand, is adult in the least fun sense of the term; it's dominated by its Rohan/Theoden storyline, and as such bogs down too much in the simplistic, boring propaganda of Tolkienian politics.  Like the people of Rohan, this subplot pushes itself into a hole from which it is very difficult to get out.  This provides opportunity for some grand battles, as I said, but between the flying arrows and battering rams and severed orc heads, not much happens.The two other storylines are a mixed bag.  Frodo and Sam's road trip to Mordor is by far the best part of the film, even if the slippery CGI Gollum distracts too much from the hobbits' character development.  This Gollum isn't quite the revelation he's been made out to be; there's a bit too much of a cartoon to him.  Andy Serkis's Donald-Duck voice is part of the problem, yes, but most of the fault isn't the actor's.  Rather, the CGI animators, for all their technical brilliance, have been allowed to run away with themselves, and the combination of a hyper-expressive CGI face and hyper-chaotic CGI body language makes for a performance that's hammier than it should have been, and could have been.  I would much rather have seen a `Dark Crystal'-esque puppet in the role, personally.  Still, the interpretation is a well-conceived, respectable take on Tolkien's most human character, and there are times when the animators actually do hold themselves back, and the character finally becomes convincing.  Sean Astin and Elijah Wood offer nice, subtle performances, but as I said, it's hard to notice them when that little bug-eyed fellow is mugging for the back row the whole time.As for the Ent storyline, well, it's a complete wash, as plodding and obvious as the big tree-people characters themselves.  It's not so much that there's anything wrong with the look of the Treebeard character or with John Rhys-Davies's voice acting, but Jackson's managing of Tolkien's triptych structure (which split the three storylines into completely different books) doesn't really work here.  It's one thing to jump back and forth between the Frodo/Sam and Aragorn/Theoden plots, because things are actually happening in them to move the plot along.  (They're not always interesting things, but you take what you can get.)  But literally NOTHING happens in the Ent storyline until the very end of the film, and jumping back to it every twenty minutes or so stalls the action terribly.  Not only that, it confuses the three subplots' temporal arc--come on, the people of Rohan have debated on what to do, fled Edoras, made an exodus to Helm's Deep, fought battle after battle after battle . . . and Merry and Pippin are STILL riding that miserable tree across the forest?Yet, for all its drawbacks, the film as a whole may be better than the sum of its parts, and fanboys, as always, will be less concerned with how entertaining the film is than with its minor digressions from the book. Non-fanboys will find it competent, certainly, but also a bit dull.  6.5 out of 10.",6,3,4,24 November 2003
School of Rock," Very likable
","2003 was a year of likable rather than great movies, and 'The School of Rock' might be the most likable of them all. The concept plays almost like a remake of 'Sister Act,' with Jack Black's die-hard rock reactionary in place of Whoopi Goldberg's R&B lounge act, and cute li'l schoolkids in place of cute li'l nuns. It's really no more complex than that, but its good nature and genuine heart make it easy enough to swallow. Plus, it's got some terrific performances. Jack Black provides all the inspired 'Spinal Tap'-esquire silliness we expect (the improvised version of 'In the End of Time' before the class is just one blindingly good example), but his best moments actually are those in which we see his instinctive compassion for the kids he works with. The character, though simple, is a nice archetype: the gifted loser who finally manages to contribute something brilliant to the world, if not in the way he expected. If there's a touch of mad genius in his performance, it's matched by Joan Cusack, who always improves just about anything she's in--for a special treat, pay close attention to all the marvelous things she does with her hands here. And the children themselves are very well cast, with the band principals, Miranda Cosgrove, and Maryam Hassan perhaps standing out. When the end comes, we might feel momentarily disappointed at how routine it actually all was, but then we'll remember the individual moments and smile. Recommended. 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,15 March 2004
Children of Men," Clever, clever, clever
","I must laugh when I read critics saying things about this film like 'powerful, but doesn't explain enough,' or raising objections like 'unfortunately, we never find out what caused the infertility in the first place' or 'how a single baby is going to change anything is never made clear.' Ha! Despite the inevitable appearance of the term *dystopian* in their reviews, these writers seem unaware that what they've seen is a satire  and satire, whether it's funny or whether it's sad, is always a kind of fantasy, and needn't play by the same rules as an artwork that pretends to exist in the real world. (I don't understand why these critics wanted the movie to explain itself more anyway, since the early scenes where it *does* do a lot of explaining are probably its worst.) In fact, probably the film this most resembles is another famous film satire, 'Brazil,' right down to its possibly-government-sponsored terrorism campaign and WWII-type propaganda. ('Suspicious? Report it' is right out of the earlier film, and the hilariously plausible 'The world collapses . . . *only Britain soldiers on*' should have been.) On paper, the plot is just as classically comic, with a naïve, reluctant hero (he's even a civil servant!), recurring characters who pop up in unexpected places, and hairsbreadth, coincidence-based escapes.But the key difference is that where Terry Gilliam inflated his movie with a cartoonish artifice, here director Alfonso Cuarón employs a punishing, sometimes shocking realism. The result is a film that, despite its (mostly visual) wit, feels so immediate, so intense, and so horrifying that you forget you're watching a comedy. But this isn't a criticism  it's exactly that irony that makes the film seem so fresh. We usually associate irony with things which make light of very serious subjects; 'Dr. Strangelove' works by taking something grave and terrifying and making it ludicrous. Cuarón is even cleverer  he takes something ludicrous, a sci-fi chase caper, and makes it grave and terrifying. It's even moving  you feel like you've been through 'Schindler's List' at the end of it. His technique is masterful . . . his style, and the artistry of his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, suggest documentary without ever fully giving over to it  apart from a somber opening theme by John Tavener, there is no original music, and the production team puts the viewer into the film at the best/worst of times, as in the escape from the Fishes' compound, the raid on Jasper's house, the final hellish descent into the Bexhill ghetto, and, especially, in the harrowing attack on Luke's van. This scene, filmed from inside the vehicle and executed without any cuts (that I noticed), is one of the most gut-wrenchingly horrifying movie moments I can remember. (But even this comes with a Hitchcockian wink, as the nominal female lead gets snuffed out a quarter way into the film, without so much as a final speech.) But while the film uses the realistic to transform the absurd, it also incorporates a third, even more surprising element: a poetry that gives this world a unique haunted quality. London makes a great ruined city; it's hard to imagine a New World metropolis having the same impact, as modern European cities already carry with them such a sense of lost and ancient civilization. In its use of architecture (actually, not only in that), the film sometimes resembles the latter part of 'Full Metal Jacket,' only this time the ruined British buildings are actually supposed to *be* ruined British buildings. The wet, green English countryside is used as a contrast to the urban horrors (though any tranquility it suggests proves false); most important of all is the amazing placement of animals  they're everywhere in the film  which are used in various ways. They give us welcome reminders of human kindness (the many beloved pets) and irresponsibility (the dead animals from farms that have become unmaintainable or unnecessary). Most of all, they are reminders of hope  or at any rate of survival, as they appear in abandoned schools and buildings under siege. (And they, too, are reminiscent of Gilliam; remember the zoo animals that flourish in the plague-emptied Philadelphia of 'Twelve Monkeys.') In a world and directorial conception this size, the characters and the performances seem appropriately small. But they're all good. Claire-Hope Ashitey has an appropriate radiance, without seeming like too magical an earth mother (Kee's joke about immaculate conception is a great comment on our expectations). Clive Owen resists any temptation to be movie-heroic, and as a result Theo comes across as surprisingly, authentically brave, as when he plunges into the tank-surrounded building in the climactic battle scene. (Compare this character with Tom Cruise's in 'War of the Worlds' and you'll realize what a failure that casting choice was.) Michael Caine gives a witty and ultimately very moving performance; his Jasper gets a brave death, too, although it's one of the moments where Cuarón edges perilously close to sadism. Pam Ferris brings real dignity to her faithful old nurse character (another familiar comic type), and Charlie Hunnam and Peter Mullan find the perfect scary/funny balance (you want to cheer when they get killed).But again, it's all Cuarón's show, and 'Children of Men' is really an amazing directorial achievement. There are movies that make you want to live inside them, and there are movies that make you want to live inside the brains of their creators. 'Children of Men' is neither, but it gets under your skin as well as any movie in my recent memory; at least for a little while, it changed the way I looked at my own reality  I was looking for its world in the real one. 'Don't you expect to hear gunshots?' I said to a friend as we walked up the sidewalk after the movie. I think he thought I was crazy. 10 out of 10.",10,3,8,12 January 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Pretentious, overrated bore
","Pretentious, overrated bore. Charlie Kaufman's screenplay seems to be trying to get at the way memory colors and shapes (sometimes inaccurately) our waking experiences and perceptions. But rather than developing that idea into anything of substance, Kaufman is content simply to hang an anchor around his neck and throw himself down a painfully repetitive, seemingly bottomless spiral of scenes in which Kate Winslet disappears from Jim Carrey's consciousness. The first time this happens, there's a fun, scary, 'Twilight Zone'-y effect, but then it happens again, and then it happens again, and then guess what happens next, and then just when you think something new is finally going to happen, Kaufman follows it up with a big et cetera, et cetera.It doesn't help much that he hasn't made his two principal characters particularly likable or believable as a couple  the relationship we're shown is all high and lows, without any of the 'middles' that comprise 90% of human relationships in the real world (as opposed to the sort of graduate-student meta-universe Kaufman prefers to explore in his films). Like Adam Sandler in 'Punch-Drunk Love,' Jim Carrey for the most part tones it down, and like Emily Watson in that same film, Kate Winslet is a very good actress, but neither one is ever able to turn these characters into real people we feel we know well. (This is particularly laughable with Carrey, since most of the movie takes place inside Joel's head!) As for the other characters, they're uniformly unpleasant, even repulsive (the subplot surrounding Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst is particularly ugly), and they might have fit in perfectly with an aggressively satirical approach that this film entirely lacks.As for Michel Gondry's direction, it's sort of generically creative with over-heavy indie seasoning; it occasionally reminded me of smaller, better movies like 'Dream with the Fishes,' and there were times when I wondered whether I would have been easier on it if it was some little unknown thing coming out of left field, instead of a Major Indie Happening with so many big names attached to it. It really does sink under the weight of the collective star power, but I can't help thinking that the repetitiousness would have made it boring no matter what. It's not quite as empty and useless as Christopher Nolan's 'Memento,' perhaps, but it tries hard. 4 out of 10.",4,4,11,9 March 2005
There's Something About Mary," Shocking the first time, boring the next
","It's hard to deny that there's something charming about this pop grossout comedy.  Like so many sick-joke aggregations before it, its heart seems genuinely to be in the right place, and all the actors turn in amiable, sympathetic performances.  But ideally a comedy should get funnier upon repeat viewings, and you really can't say that at all here.  The laughs it creates come entirely from the shock of seeing them for the first time.  Oh my God, look at that semen on his ear!  Oh my God, look at those eruptions on Chris Elliott's face!  Oh my God, look at Magda's breasts!  Creating these kinds of shock effects, and doing it without alienating the audience's sympathies, is not a small achievement--just ask John Waters or the Monty Python troupe how hard it is. But it is not, perhaps, a great one either, and when I saw it again last night, I thought, oh, there's the semen on his ear.  There's the eruptions on Chris Elliott's face.  Sigh.  Yawn.  Et cetera.The difference between `There's Something About Mary' and a John Waters or Python film might be that Waters and the Pythons have always used shock to make a point about something, to comment in irreverent or even offensive ways on some aspect of modern culture (usually critically).  The Farrellys don't set their sights quite so high, and that's fine, but it results in a picture that doesn't give the audience anything to want to relive.  It's a parade of grostesquerie with a heart, yes, but really without substance or real style.  Even the technical stuff doesn't stand up--I kept thinking how much funnier the dog-battle scene would have been if Barry Sonnenfeld, or somebody more proficient with a camera, had shot it.  What reason, exactly, would anyone have for watching this movie more than once?    It feels remarkably empty, and has already dated badly after just five years.  (I don't doubt that in twenty years people will watch this movie again and not be able to remember what they used to enjoy about it.) You might as well be listening to somebody describe its events as watching it, because in the end it's a movie in which the ideas are shocking, but everything else is quite ordinary.  5.5 out of 10.",5,1,2,29 September 2003
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Zzzzz
","Nearly 30 years after its release, 'Salò' continues to enjoy, if that is the word I want, a reputation as a pinnacle of depravity, and thus draws to it both the blood-lusting 'Mondo Cane' crowd, simply interested in being shocked for its own sake, and fans of shock auteurs like Von Trier, Cronenberg, Greenaway et al., who like to look for beauty beneath grotesque surfaces. But both types of viewers will be disappointed to find that the most shocking thing about 'Salò' is how dull it is. Can this film really have raised eyebrows that much in the post-Warhol, post-Waters seventies? Today, its parade of filth and violence actually seems rather tame. You need to have the stomach for it, but it's hardly mind-blowingly horrible.So, having dealt with 'Salò's' shock elements, I would now move on to its artistic qualities, only there really aren't any. Pasolini's technique is ham-fisted here, reminding one even more of Doris Wishman than of Warhol/Morrissey or Waters, and the content consists of a single thesis statement ('Fascism is bad'). Hardly an idea anybody would argue with, but not exactly profound either. Even as propaganda it's extremely weak--never elaborated in particularly imaginative or interesting or convincing ways. It's like one panel of a none-too-intelligent political cartoon stretched very thin over a two-hour period. Well, here's another rape . . . oh, look, some sh*t-eating . . . well, more torture. Ho hum. 0 out of 10.",1,70,140,20 September 2004
Three Colors: Blue," Do we like her? Do we feel anything?
","Something of a model of directorial focus and control, 'Bleu' seems to be an attempt to answer several related questions: How can a filmmaker express the feelings for someone who won't, or can't, express them herself? Can the director make the viewer understand her, like her, share her feelings? Krzysztof Kieslowski comes very close, finding ingenious, even brilliant ways to get inside the head of his deliberately impenetrable Julie. The frequent 'blackouts,' coupled with the throbbing, somber score (inspired, it seems, at least in part, by Mozart's 'Requiem'), gives us a window into the character's inner life, lets us hear, rather than see, the humanity behind her aloof façade. We understand her--but do we like her? How easy it would be for Julie to become totally unlikable--the way Juliette Binoche plays her, she is blank to the point of coldness, sometimes in ways reminiscent of Catherine Deneuve's Carole in 'Repulsion,' only with a taut intelligence that character certainly lacks. Somehow, she never does; but, for all the actress's control, the characterization is ultimately Kieslowski's creation, not hers. It's the directorial techniques, and not the acting, that allow us to care about Julie. So, do we ever share her feelings? No, despite all Kieslowski's tricks, we really can't. So often, Americans wrongly write off European films as 'cold,' and that's why it's surprising that this movie, which directly tackles the question of emotional frigidity, and which has such a passionate following among cinephiles, should turn out never to make us feel really anything. Oh, the film has an undeniable emotionalism, a potency, just beneath the surface, yes. But it's never willing to go the extra step and manipulate the viewer in an outright way. It's too respectful of its audience, too intelligent, too careful, for that. And this studied, uncompromising unsentimentality in itself is an achievement Kieslowski should be commended for, but some may find it makes 'Bleu' into a portrait of grief to be admired, rather than loved. 7 out of 10.",7,70,123,11 August 2004
Mystic River," A 'Law & Order' episode in prestige-film drag
","Yes, Clint Eastwood comes close to saving 'Mystic River,' but what exactly is it he's working so hard to save? A hokey, predictable potboiler, basically a grim, grimy episode of 'Law & Order,' pumped up with artificial Stephen-King flavoring (working-class New England setting, we-were-all-boys-together schtick, even a molested child). Eastwood tries to pull together a 'Godfather' with this pulpy suspense story, and it seems he pretty much succeeded with audiences and critics alike. And certainly, his style is assured--beautifully shot and lit without being pretentious, and nuzzling the conventions of the genre without ever lapsing into outright cliché. He plays against the corniness and stupidity of the script, and we very nearly forgive all the plot contrivances and coincidences, all the melodramatic, self-important 'moments,' and all the echoes of good and bad movies (and TV shows) past. Yes, very nearly. But by the film's climax, we realize that this pulp has a decidedly pre-chewed feel; and once we're past the final will-he-or-won't-he standoff between Sean Penn and Tim Robbins (honestly, how surprising would the outcome have been either way?), Eastwood shows us he doesn't take this stuff seriously at all. He suddenly gives us, in quick succession: (a) a pat wrap-up of a Kevin Bacon subplot that we never cared about anyway, (b) a laughable Lady-Macbeth routine from Laura Linney that only makes us realize how poorly her character had been realized up to that point, and (c) an overlong, 'ambiguous' parade scene that reunites the major characters, and that might have had more resonance if we actually cared about any of them. And, despite some very hard work from some very good actors, we don't. By now, Sean Penn should be legally forbidden to shout and/or cry in a film; he's turned into a parody of himself, and as such it's hardly surprising that the Academy finally recognized him this year. Here he can't even milk emotion from a dead-child storyline--all we see is the same old scowling and howling and mugging for the back row. Tim Robbins, on the other hand, disappears into the accent and gait of the psychologically damaged schlub Dave . . . and yet an actor disappearing isn't necessarily the same thing as a character emerging. (It isn't here, anyway.) Probably the best acting comes from Marcia Gay Harden, and yet her unlikable character is never developed, and is probably the most purely functional character in a plot full of them. Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne have less showier roles, but they manage to breathe more life into them than we might expect. If you approach the film as you would a TV murder mystery rather than the MAGNIFICENT CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE it's been made out to be, you might enjoy it. But personally, if I was going to make a script this cheesy into a film, I would have hired a director to turn its liabilities into strengths, not one who would try to hide them. At his peak, Dario Argento might have made a masterpiece out of this. 5.5 out of 10.",5,10,21,19 July 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," Darkest holiday fantasy since Dickens
","For all its reputation as one of the greatest feel-good movies of all time, `It's a Wonderful Life's' main strength comes from its expression of pain. After a long and charming (but not overly sentimental) buildup, the dark final act of the film comes as a terrific surprise.  This isn't a didactic but fundamentally kind object lesson like `Miracle on 34th Street'; instead, the moral gets delivered to us via a much crueler narrative turn.  Indeed, the last 45-minute stretch is a spiraling nightmare, with jovial angel Clarence teaching his suicidal charge a lesson by showing him a sick, inverted caricature of his world.  It's like a perverse version of `A Christmas Carol' imagined by Rod Serling.  Of course it has a happy ending, but make no mistake, the genius of the film is that Capra is not afraid to hurt George Bailey (and by extension to hurt us)--often quite badly. Perhaps the most painful moments happen even before Clarence steps in; the last scene at the Bailey house is one of the most emotionally excruciating scenes in film history, with all of the technical elements (the witty dialogue and camerawork, Jimmy Stewart's dazed, crazed performance and Donna Reed's understated one, and perhaps most important of all, Janie's incessant rendition of `Hark! the Herald Angels Sing') combining to get us gritting our teeth and clutching our armrests in agony.  After all that, the resolution comes as one of the most deserved, redeeming happy endings of all time--the audience feels as liberated and transformed as George does.  As I mentioned, the sentiment never really overwhelms things; Capra and his (credited and uncredited) screenwriters inject enough darkness into the script (beginning with the Mr. Gower scene), and enough sharp and self-deprecatory humor, too, but most important the director never lets the plot stand still long enough to get treacly.  His oft-imitated style looks to modern eyes not to be cheesy or dated, but remarkably elegant.  It doesn't really matter how often we see this film; it still hurts, every single time, and in this case that's a beautiful thing.  10 out of 10.",10,1,5,15 December 2003
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Acclaimed, but under-appreciated, too
","Disney's premiere full-length animated film is more than worth a look, even today. A movie as acclaimed and beloved as 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' shouldn't really need a defense, but some movie lovers who haven't seen it in years may assume it's a gooey, girly snorefest (à la 'Sleeping Beauty')--and many of the comments here suggest that viewers don't really get what they're looking at. Sure, Snow White herself is a complete drip, and her Prince is even worse; and yes, there is an obnoxious sexism burbling not too far below the surface. But the film is crammed with so much busy motion and freakiness that we barely even care. Every frame is as amusing and ingenious as one of Gepetto's clocks in 'Pinocchio,' whether it's inhabited by dancing dwarfs, clattering dishes, bubbly water splashes, or that incredible swarming menagerie of deer, squirrels, rabbits and birds. And the rotoscoping technique, though undeniably primitive, is remarkably effective at creating this believable fantasy world. It adds a sometimes shocking element of realism to the cartoonier characters--by God, Happy looks *real* during his dance in the 'Silly Song'--and adds a sinister theatricality to the horrible eyeless Mirror and the stooping, nightmarish witch as she shambles out of the reeds and into the fog. God, that witch! Disney is often criticized for sanitizing the original fairy tales in his adaptations, but this one, while it may stop short of having the Queen actually *eat* 'Snow White's' heart, is still pretty horrific in places. (Not to mention the macabre sense of humor she magically acquires after drinking the potion--'Thirsty? Have a drink!') The experience of the film's dark, unique fantasy world only improves on repeat viewings, too. Highly recommended, especially to those who haven't seen it in a while. 9.5 out of 10.",9,2,3,14 May 2004
The Lion King," Ambitious, but deeply flawed
","At the time, it seemed like an almost ominously good idea: an animated Disney film that was to plumb new depths of darkness and emotion. Critics have identified everything from 'Bambi' to 'Hamlet' to the Passion story as source material, and while some of those parallels might be more forced than others, some certainly have the ring of truth ('Hamlet' in particular), and it's obvious that Disney was attempting to stretch here, with an animated feature more adult and literate than the three consecutive comic operas it had produced before it.The movie made a bundle of money, of course, but somebody at Disney must have found something very wrong with it, as they never tried to duplicate the 'Lion King' model again. (In fact, 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' can be viewed as its exact opposite  a film that tries to turn a dark, ambitious, literary work into a junk TV cartoon.) In terms of musical style, too, the subsequent diminishing-returns animated films from Disney mainly reverted to the Ashman/Menken mock-Broadway formula, instead of imitating this pop-rock precedent.So, 'The Lion King' is ambitious. But is it successful? As Mufasa and Scar would certainly agree, these things do not always go hand in hand. And despite its conceptual daring, 'The Lion King' must be judged at best an artistic compromise, and at worst an all-out failure. The design, of course, is spectacular, and the first sequence stands not only with other animated films but with all movie musicals as one of the most memorable opening numbers of all time.But it isn't long before things start to go wrong. Elton John's songs are tuneful enough, but Tim Rice's lyrics are surprisingly witless, suffering from vague language and clumsy imagery ('Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared'  bared ambitions?). It's surprising how much the Menken/Ashman team is missed  'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' tried hard to be 'Under the Sea' on the savanna, but Ashman's witty patter, almost more like something out of Gilbert and Sullivan than Broadway, is sorely lacking. (Ashman might actually have been the magic ingredient in the Disney recipe  they haven't made a decent non-Pixar animated feature since he died.) Jeremy Irons, as Scar, essentially repeats Jonathan Freeman's campy Jafar from 'Aladdin,' if anything achieving the remarkable feat of making this character even more mincing ('I must practice my curtsy,' he sniffs when Mufasa reminds him of the rules of succession). And much of the adult appeal is squelched by the insertion of the most gratingly unfunny comic-relief characters into the mix. I find it nearly inconceivable that Disney should eventually have chosen to remake the film from the point of view of its worst characters.Furthermore, over the decades Disney has been accused of racism and sexism in its cartoons, both rightly and wrongly  but it's hard to deny that both are genuinely present here. After all, why shouldn't the hyena caste (socially inferior only because of their species) have a place at the table? (The use of Nazi imagery to depict them is more than a little ridiculous, given the lions are obviously the 'Master Race' in the world of the film.) And as for sexism, why do the lionesses need a male to come back and rescue them from an effete wimp like Scar at all? So in the end, the design remains beautiful, and certainly not everyone will have the same problems with the irritating elements I've discussed. Plus, I suppose some points have to be given for ambitious intent in itself. And yet the film as a whole provides neither the challenge nor the satisfaction it might have, and that's a true disappointment. 5 out of 10.",5,12,36,20 January 2005
Halloween," Beautiful
","One of the simplest and most beautiful horror films ever made, `Halloween' still manages to impress, especially now that its worst imitators are thankfully starting to be forgotten.  The young John Carpenter understood that truly stylish filmmaking need not grow out of self-indulgence (unlike, say, Brian DePalma), and the gracefulness of the picture's style comes largely from his directorial restraint.  Well, he didn't really have much of a choice; he had no money, and so the pure-and-simple road was the only one available for him.  Thank goodness for that.  The film remains as gorgeous and watchable as ever, with the inspired lighting, tense set pieces, and incessant minimalist score being only a few of the notable technical elements.  It also features two marvelously authentic performances, one by the young Jamie Lee Curtis (still perhaps the best one of her career), and the other by non-actor Nick Castle, whose eloquent body language makes the Shape more frightening than that blank mask alone ever could.  So many years down the road, it may not be the scariest horror movie you've ever seen, but you'll be hard pressed to find one more elegant.  10 out of 10.",10,4,5,6 November 2003
Signs," Creepy, but way too coincidence-based--and with a hidden agenda
","SPOILERSFirst of all, Shyamalan shows that he still knows how to set up and shoot skin-crawlingly creepy set pieces. The best ones are reminiscent of early John Carpenter, and that's pretty good. The script borrows liberally from H. P. Lovecraft, 'Night of the Living Dead,' 'The Exorcist,' and '50s-era alien paranoia movies, but you could have worse inspiration than that. The performances are uniformly fine, and if you don't think about it too much, you might enjoy the movie purely for its harmonious aesthetic elements--its assured camera-work, stylish art direction, wry script, etc.Unfortunately, if you do give the movie more than 30 seconds' thought after the credits roll, it'll pretty much fall apart. The ending, not unlike that of 'Unbreakable,' depends on the audience swallowing some truly ludicrous coincidences, and leaves us with about seventeen unanswered questions. What did the aliens want in the first place? Why do they leave so suddenly? Where do they go? If they can be destroyed by water, why on earth do they want to invade a planet where it falls from the sky every half hour? Did Joaquin Phoenix really require such an involved backstory just to set up his beating the crap out of the alien with a baseball bat? And how the hell did Mel Gibson's dying wife know about it all?Well, that's the big question, of course. At one point, Gibson's fallen preacher tells his brother that there's no such thing as coincidence, and, yes, Virginia, there really is a cornball, miracles-are-REAL! message hidden none-too-subtly here. Well, I hate to break this to Mr. Shyamalan, but 'Miracles are REAL!' is a very convenient, very lazy way to rationalize away all those coincidences, and inserting a pretentious speech about coincidence-vs.-divine-design doesn't change that fact; no sir, not one bit.In the end, your enjoyment of this film will depend on how much you're willing to suspend disbelief, and how well you stomach the idea that God would use an alien invasion as a tool to restore one preacher's faith. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. 5.5 out of 10.",5,1,2,2 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Grand pop entertainment
","Peter Jackson pulls out all the stops in the finale to his 'Lord of the Rings' adaptation, and the result is pretty satisfying. It's hard to say whether this is because of anything uniquely brilliant about this film, or because Jackson simply doesn't drop the ball with this closing chapter, as we've seen happen in many other movie series. By now, these characters have become so familiar to us that the film almost has its emotional effectiveness pre-programmed, built in. Even the score seems like an old friend--Howard Shore's variations on his own themes makes those themes seem better than they actually are. But there's more to it than that, I think; the movie's actually not at all bad on its own. After the effective setup of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and the rather plodding development of 'The Two Towers,' Jackson directs like a master here, spinning what feels like eight or ten subplots together into a swirling, thrilling, chaotic Armageddon of a picture, truly capturing the apocalyptic character of Tolkien's epic conflict. His hand is sure; his style and good taste rarely falter. For all its overstuffed quality, the film gives us quick flashes of special-effects wizardry--a surging river of horsemen, a black jabberwock thing fleeting overhead, a giant spider pushing its front legs out of its trapdoor--rather than laboring any particular effect. (This is even true with the CGI Gollum, which I was nearly alone in finding embarrassingly overdone in 'The Two Towers.') The cast returns to the uniformly high standard that was so impressive in 'Fellowship'; in fact, some of them (notably Sean Astin, Andy Serkis, and Billy Boyd) improve on their performances in the earlier films, and only Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn begins to show signs of strain. The twinkle is back in Ian McKellen's eye as Gandalf, and Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are thankfully given more to do this time around (even if Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are not). John Noble contributes a nice low-browed glower to the proceedings as the nutcase Denethor, a truly flawed character who makes a welcome addition to Tolkien's pantheon of mostly pure goodies and baddies. As others have pointed out, it's hard to judge these films individually, and that works both in their favor and against it. Perhaps there's never been a film series in which the forest has been made as much a priority as the trees, as it has here; 'Star Wars' certainly doesn't do it, nor do 'Planet of the Apes' or 'Indiana Jones' or even 'Alien,' not really. In fact probably the only one I know that might come close is 'The Godfather,' which, like this series, covers three films with a blanket style, but which uses each one of those films to a different end, tonally, thematically, and structurally. 'Godfather 3' was a semi-disaster, of course, and 'Return of the King' is not, but the comparison stands, and the two series also have in common the fact that they are ascribed a measure of depth that probably isn't there. More than anything, the 'Lord of the Rings' movies are grand pop entertainments, aesthetic marvels that amaze in terms of technique and style, but that only work on deeper levels if you are one of the devout, or if you are willing to be very, *very* indulgent. There are times when Peter Jackson's unfailingly reverent, unwinking approach to Tolkien's stodgy, creaky, borderline racist adventure story seems a bit silly, especially coming from the creator of the subversive 'Braindead' and 'Bad Taste,' as well as his one genuine masterpiece of psychological depth, 'Heavenly Creatures.' (Those of us who wish Jackson would leave the kids' stuff behind and make another film like the latter may be in the minority, but we are right.) Still, pop entertainment is not without its pleasures, and they can be intense ones. As pop entertainments go, 'The Lord of the Rings' remains strong, and 'The Return of the King' shows off the best the series has to offer. Movie: 8.5 out of 10.

Cube," Beautiful little nightmare of a movie
","Gripping entry in the trapped-in-a-room horror subgenre that also includes classics like `Night of the Living Dead' and Carpenter's `The Thing.'  It's not quite up to the standard of those two films--the script is in places talky or heavy-handed or cheesy, and two or three of the performers are unfortunately hammy.  (Actually, in the case of Nicky Guadagni, replace the words `unfortunately hammy' with `unforgivably awful.')  Still, the overall effect is very good, and the film (rather surprisingly) stands up well to repeat viewings, too.  It's not so much that the paranoid premise is appealing (though it is), but rather that director Vincenzo Natali really seems to understand how to pace this peculiar drama of his.  It's hard to imagine another film essentially set in a single room that manages to pull the rug out from us so often.  From the prologue on, we are presented with shocks and twists that keep our allegiances shifting from character to character, and our rumps balanced uncomfortably on the edge of our seats. The design and lighting are more than striking, and if in the end things don't make a whole lot of sense, one gets the impression that that was never the director's aim in the first place.  Instead, he seems to have set out simply to make a beautiful little nightmare of a movie, and at that he succeeded well.  8.5 out of 10.",8,0,1,12 January 2004
Jackie Brown," Entertaining
","Entertaining entry in the Tarantino canon. It never quite lives up to the promise of its stylish opening-credits sequence (could any mere story live up to that thrilling tracking shot? Who is this person? What's going to happen to her?), and in places it again shows the director's casual disregard for human life (or for character life, anyway). But all in all it's a fine entertainment, well acted (especially by Robert DeNiro in his small role), believably characterized (the romance element is particularly nice), and suspensefully plotted. And, as usual with Tarantino, the best part of all is the vibrant, chattering screenplay, yet another virtuoso exercise in language. 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,10 November 2004
The Birds," A true puzzle without an answer; brilliant
","One of Hitchcock's most enigmatic and fascinating films, a true puzzle without an answer. Hitchcock chucks away all but the barest conceit of DuMaurier's story, and instead constructs an elegant little comedy of manners so dry it'll sting your lips. Tippi Hedren's spoiled rich girl makes a trip to a west-coast fishing town to play a joke on a smartass lawyer who still lives with his mum, and things get complicated. In the movie's first half, the director layers on the sexual tensions and the bitchy wit until you're at the screaming point--and then unleashes a cataclysmic natural horror so unspeakable it could be something out of the Bible. All technical elements are superb. Hitchcock, so well known for his use of music, shows here how terrifying silence can be, and 'The Birds' remains an intensely quiet picture, even punctuated, as it is, by sudden noisy violence. The set pieces, like the fireplace scene, the playground scene, and the visit with Dan Fawcett, are studies in perfection. The cast is smooth down to the tiniest roles, with the proto-Altman ensemble scene in the diner being one of the most memorable segments in a film chock-full of them.And it is literally impossible to imagine better-cast actors in the leads. Hedren is perfect as Melanie Daniels, the party girl who, while not nearly as clever as she thinks she is, may just be telling the truth when she says she's looking for something more meaningful in her life. Rod Taylor is charming and somewhat inscrutable as the local-boy-made-good who thinks he knows what he wants. Suzanne Pleschette is smoldering as the cynical (and perhaps sexually ambiguous) schoolteacher who takes Melanie in.And perhaps most important, Jessica Tandy is a searing, twitchily hypnotic presence as Lydia Brenner, surely one of greatest supporting characters in the Hitchcock pantheon.As the movie runs on, the director gleefully ignores one loose end after another, leaving the viewer with an epic catalogue of unanswered questions at the climax (the most important of which is articulated by the diner's birdwatching crone: Why?). And if you're the kind of moviegoer who likes having everything neatly explained, you'd best try something else. But if you like ambiguity (and a healthy dose of existential nightmarishness), it doesn't get any better than this. 10 out of 10.",10,91,139,8 May 2003
