First Man," Masterpiece
","This movie is a masterpiece. It has avoided all the pitfalls. The only reason I've given it 9 instead of 10 is because of an exaggerated use of the free-handed camera. It became noticeably annoying after a while.
Apart from that, I really enjoyed it. I'm one of those people who watched the moon landing in real time in 1969. It made me reconnect with that moment.
I especially appreciated the use of claustrophobic effects for all the missions described except the last. It helps to connect with what the astronauts must have felt dyring the flights.Beautiful work.Thank you for this.",9,1,4,17 November 2018
No Country for Old Men," Shocker
","This film is simply mesmerizing. The spectator keeps expecting what will happen next and systematically fails to predict it accurately. Violence is as much explicit as it is sometimes scene-skipped. I normally hate movies which end in an open ending, but this one is simply masterfully done. Yes it's anticlimactic, but it's also unexpected, which in itself is also a shocker. There are plenty of loose ends, but again the movie stands to demonstrate that real life doesn't necessarily wraps up neatly.
For a movie style which I would normally not enjoy, this one was particularly entertaining and thought-provoking.I highly recommend it.",9,1,1,21 November 2019
Joker," Nothing like Heath Ledger
","The disappointment of the year. The story is empty, without a clear purpose. In depth characterization doesn't make a movie by itself. It's boring as hell.",3,6,14,11 November 2019
