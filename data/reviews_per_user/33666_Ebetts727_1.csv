The Benchwarmers," Very Excellent and Hilarious
","This movie is absolutely hysterical. Don't listen to critics about this film. It's got every dose of humor that you need. My friend thinks every Rob Schneider and David Spade movie sucks, but I don't listen to him because he is a a moron and has no good taste in movies. This is a movie about 3 guys who were never accepted into the jock world as kids, so they challenge the other teams to a tournament of baseball to win a precious stadium. Think of it like Revenge of the Nerds meets The Bad News Bears. This movie looked like it was a blast to make. Jon Heder from Napoleon Dynamite was hilarious in this film. Rob Schneider was awesome. His wife is played by the very sexy model Molly Sims (MTV's House of Style). I recommend you guys go out to see this movie. It's a great buddy flick. If you are into the Adam Sandler kind of humor this movie is for you.",10,4,9,10 April 2006
