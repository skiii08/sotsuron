Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Skip the critics and just go see it. D.A.R.E. to think for yourself...
","My buddy Dave and I were two of several hundred people waiting in line at Phipps Plaza last night around midnight, and among several thousand nuts, night-owls, and geeks around the nation hanging out in local movie theatres in anticipation of 'The Phantom Menace'.  We became the first few of what will likely be millions of people to see 'Episode I', the latest George Lucas (who shares the same birthday as I do) 'Star Wars' film.  I could not help but remember that summer when I was 7, also waiting in these same lines (though in Knoxville, Tennessee) to see 'Star Wars' for the up-teenth time, just so I could go home and brag that I was one-up on my good buddy Chris Leonard on how many times we had seen the movie (bet I am one-up on him again).  Anyway, they let us in last night 45 minutes early and the crowd did not stop buzzing until a roar went up when we all saw the words 'Star Wars' flash on the screen, and then start it's slow descent off in space, followed by 'Episode I' and then a short description of where we were and what was going on in the 'present time' of the movie (known for that trapezoidal text-crawl).  I must say that the first half was somewhat slow and often flat, but the film really picked up speed (in many ways) in the second half.  There were many shouts from the audience when we first saw a young Obi-Wan, or when R2-D2 meets C-3PO, or when we first heard the name 'Skywalker'.  Like it or not, this is probably the most anticipated film in history and will eventually become part of our culture just as the 3 earlier movies did and just as the next 2 will.  'The Phantom Menace' was certainly not the best film I had ever seen, but I did not go into it thinking it would be.  The effects were what you would expect and though the acting was sometimes dull, 'Menace' does not disappoint.  Like me, you will most certainly leave the theatre pleased, waiting for 'Episode II'...",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
Minority Report," I'm probably not in the 'minority' here...
","Spielberg (after letting us down with 'A.I.') comes back with an outstanding entry in the sci-fi genre, and Cruise does not annoy us in 'Minority Report' either.  What a great film, and it's never slow.  I'd like to say it's a combination of 'Blade Runner' and 'Mission Impossible' (both great films), but it really does stand alone all on it's own.  I was really impressed with Samantha Morton's character Agatha (the smartest of the pre-cogs) and it was nice to see Max von Sydow appear in another fantastic film...   Not a real spoiler here, but wouldn't you think that Anderton's (Cruise) real eyes would not have been granted access from security within the police building after it was clearly established he was on the run?  Just my 2cents there. Other than that, I can't think of a flaw within this film.  Go see it and prepare for a excellent film...",Null,0,0,19 June 2002
Memento," In through the out door
","This one is for the ages.  'Memento' was one I just saw on a whim and it turned out to be breathtaking.  I was telling people afterwards to see it, comparing it to 'The Usual Suspects' and 'The 6th Sense', not in content, but in how you felt after seeing those films.  Nothing pleases me more than watching a great movie and then discussing it for hours upon end afterwards. I'm going to be brief here, but I will tell you this - see it!",10,0,2,4 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of a clone of 'Empire' & 'Gladiator'
","Well, as I wrote 3 years ago, there is much hype and there are many expectations for this film, yet it just barely comes through.  I saw a midnight showing last night and almost had problems staying awake at times. Sure, the visual effects were stunning (with almost too much going on in the backgrounds), but this was the most poorly acted of the 5 films.  Hayden Christensen ('Anakin Skywalker'), Sam Jackson ('Mace Windu'), and Christopher Lee ('Darth Tyranus') sound like they are reading lines right off of cue cards.  And there are WAY too many love (or, 'pre-love') scenes between Anakin and Amidala.  I know that's a huge part of the entire story, but I found them sooo boring.  Some of the light-saber fights are good, but many other scenes were unintendedly funny (like Yoda fighting Darth Tyranus).  C-3PO is hilarious - probably the most redeemable character in the film, though Ewan McGregor does a good job as 'Obi-Wan'...   After the film we all discussed how this was too similar to 'Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Gladiator' (I kept waiting for Russell Crowe to pop up in that scene).  I will say that Lucas does plant the seeds for Episode III very well, as everything will be connected between the trilogies in 3 years. At least Jar Jar's role was limited in this one...   Overall I'd rank this one 3rd (behind 'Empire' and the original) and give it a 6 or 7/10.  Maybe if I see it a few more times (I'm sure I will), it will improve in my eyes. Still, you HAVE to see it because it is what it is:  part of our film culture...",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
American Psycho," It's hip to be square...
","I think the thing I love most about this movie is that most of the people and critics out there really hate it.  Good.  This is not the type of film for most movie-user-friendly people out there and it amuses me so much to hear everyone say, 'I did not understand it and was very upset over some scenes.'  Stick with your Julia Roberts movies and sit-coms...   It was over a year ago when I heard Mary Harron was directing this movie.  I had just re-read the book and that feeling of wanting to see this story was hitting me again.  Then I read something about Leonardo DiCaprio had backed-out of the lead role.  I should have mailed that pretty boy some KleenX.  Relieved to hear this new young to-be-star Christian Bale was going to be our Pat Bateman, I started reading everything I could in anticipation of 'American Psycho' to hit the screen.  Anyway, the long wait ended this Friday (twice) and again this past Sunday.  The movie exceeded my expectations.  Bale was amazing, along with the rest of the cast (most especially ChloÃ« Sevigny who played 'Jean').  I could not stop laughing and have been trying to tell everyone that this is a black comedy with a couple of gut-wrenching scenes. The point is that if you do not catch on to that early, you will probably not enjoy the rest of the film.  People got up and left when I saw it for the 3rd time.  Hahahaha.  'Leave', I thought.  The greed of the 1980's will never be better portrayed on screen and one will have to search pretty far to find a more unique story.  Though I have been a big fan of the book for a while now, I will take nothing away from the movie, which is one of the rare cases when a good read is also a good view.  I heard Hewy Lewis refused to allow his song to be put on the CD soundtrack after he heard about the scene (wonder if I need a new raincoat?) in the film it is used for.  Hahahaha - Hewy have some 'heart & soul'...psyCohn",Null,0,0,17 April 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," crouching hype, hidden boredom
","Wow, I posted an imdb comment the other day and been flooded with nothing but hate mail.  Sorry, but I still just do not 'get' this film.  What makes it so good?  The story is just simply boring, the fight scenes are quite unoriginal, and the plot (assuming that is what it was) was very weak.  I am still laughing at all of these people saying this is the best film of the year (or that they have ever seen).  They need to hit the video store fast. Give me a big break.  'Traffic' blows this sorry movie right out of the water and I'm sure that no matter how many more films I see from the year 2000, the majority will be better than 'CTHD'...",3,0,0,26 January 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," are you kidding me?
","This movie was barely good.  What is up with all of the hype?  The acting was nothing special and just because they over did it with scenes straight out of 'The Matrix', don't go thinking this was the Asian version.  Very, very, very overrated and only watch if someone gives you a free ticket...",3,1,2,24 January 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," QT pays homage to, well, everything...
","Another entry to the 'you will either love it or hate it' genre. Personally, I liked this over-the-top film of a former female assassin seeking revenge on those who tried to put her (permanently) away.  I've laughed at some of these reviews where people are saying how this is the worst film of all-time, etc.  People, please pay attention here.  Tarantino intentionally made this film exactly how he wanted to.  It's a tribute to virtually every karate, action, drama, adventure film (or tv show) he ever liked.  Yes, it does have the feel of a 70's B-movie at times.  Yes, it does not exactly flow in a straight-forward fashion (as many of these reviewers would apparently like all of their movies to go).  And yes, some of the action/violence is extreme and implausible, BUT THIS IS BECAUSE HE WANTED IT THAT WAY.  If you have ever seen any of the films referenced in this one (click on the 'movie connections' link here on the imdb site for 'Kill Bill'), then you might have a different way of looking at this movie.  I have seen many of these films and totally love what QT did with this one.  I can't wait for Vol. 2.  For the rest of you, I'm sure 'Terminator 4' is just around the corner...",Null,0,1,5 November 2003
Black Hawk Down," Will truly keep you on the edge of your seat...
","Like most of us, I've seen plenty of war movies in my day.  Never before, though, have I seen one that was as consistently intense as this one.  For about 90 minutes, 'Black Hawk Down' had me on the edge of my seat.  I felt as if I was being shot at right there in Somalia...   Great acting by the old vet's (is Tom Sizemore ever bad?) and by the young cast (especially Josh Hartnett).  I must admit I did not expect too much from a Bruckheimer production, but I guess the excellent directing from Ridley Scott (a true master) overcame the typical no-story action films Bruckheimer usually throws our way.  Highly recommended...   9/10",Null,0,0,16 January 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," my eyes are wide open
","Spectacular!  Hey, if you want to listen to all of those stuffy critics, then stay at home.  'Eyes' should be taught at the best film schools. Cruise was never better.  Kubrick did not let us down at all with his grand finale.  Loved how Kidman's dreams were Cruise's reality, the irony of the 'password', and those classic Kubrick settings & lights.  And did it not have the best ending this decade?  It is a shame new movies will never be made like that again; the film world got a little lighter after this past spring.  Stan was the man and will be missed over here by his biggest fan...",10,0,0,16 July 1999
X2: X-Men United," not as good as the 1st...
","*mini-spoilers* I liked the film, just didn't love it. No, I am not the biggest X-Men fan and so I don't really know the inside stuff on all of the characters, and maybe that's where some of my ?'s come from.  I do know these 'middle' movies of 3somes are tough, but this one really just didn't do anything. I thought Wolverine's past should have either been further explored or hardly mentioned. Why couldn't Iceman not just freeze the water & save Jean Gray? And where did Magneto & Mystique run off to @ the end? I know the purpose of this one was to leave a few questions, but I just thought that the majority of this movie was just some pretty good action thrown together a very loose plot. I'm a big fan of the 1st one and I'm sure I'll see the next one, which hopefully will be a little more smooth than this one...",Null,0,0,2 May 2003
