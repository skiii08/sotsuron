The Avengers," Stunningly Intense, Emotional, Likable and Funny!
","Saw it yesterday with my nephews and niece and enjoyed it more than any other Marvel adaptation since Spiderman.I can't think of any other recent film that could make this granite-faced 39 year old crack a grin at its moments of old-fashioned super-heroic 'awesome!', such as when Captain America intervenes at the last moment to save a brave civilian from being vapourised, or simply watching a succession of childhood heroes duke it out with many a 'THOOM!' and a 'WHAM!' Yes, this film taps into our need for larger than life heroes, while at the same time making them likable by allowing us to laugh at them: Captain America is super-strong, brave and handsome, but probably wouldn't know how to use a computer mouse. Thor, aka 'PointBreak', wears his mother's drapes. The Hulk is a dangerously powerful toddler in torn shorts.I even preferred Tony Stark in this one than his own films: somehow his wisecracking arrogance is much more impressive when it's at the expense of demi-gods and superhumans! With the tactical prowess of Captain A., the director has managed to get each character to play an equal part in their own special way, while providing a lot of fun and interest in the way they interact, whether they're cooperating or otherwise.When a film's heroes are near invincible it can be hard to induce a sense of jeopardy, but this film succeeds in doing that by providing an unexpected event which also lends a strong emotional core. We are also shown that our heroes can bleed: in 2 effective moments I remember there is a pause, we see that a hero is badly injured, but he carries on without complaint.Such is the goodwill fostered by the film, I'm prepared to skim over the negatives. I'd have preferred the gathering of the team to be hastened on a bit, and I think one stunt pulled by the Black Widow seemed more believably suited to a super-powered being, which was unnecessary as her more 'down to earth' abilities were already enough to prove that she was a valuable part of the team.After we emerged from the cinema, we were all still pretty stunned from the intensity of the action. The verdict of my companions? The film rendered the life of my 15 year old nephew complete; his 11 year old brother thought it was 'OK', and my 7 year old niece was inspired to switch her favourite character from Thor to The Hulk.",9,1,3,29 April 2012
Heat," A masterpiece of masculinity
","I cite this film was a masterpiece of masculinity, but as an exploration of character it does little for me.Michael Mann bears comparison to John Woo: he is a fantastic stylist, great at portraying the excitingly macho world of gunplay, cops and robbers, sharp suits. The characterisation is risible though, camp to be honest.It's obvious that the director wants to show he's making an effort to humanise his characters: unfortunately there's nothing humanly quirky about the methods used. Pacino as a cop obsessed with the job at the expense of a failing marriage is nothing new. The odd manic outburst is purely Pacino, and appears to have nothing to do with the character. De Niro is quiet De Niro, with a beard. When the 2 meet, fortunately it's brief, because suddenly we're not watching the characters, we're watching the actors. (Did anyone else find the dialogue here a bit of a let down?) The final loyalty of the Val Kilmer character's wife at their separation is touching, but the theme is duplicated with De Niro's character and his girlfriend. This repetition is a luxury that might have been avoided. It's a long film.Any pretence at this being a serious examination of crime is lost at the beginning: a lot of the tension hinges on us believing that the criminals are formidably competent, but from the off they've needlessly executed the security guards during a raid, followed by a scene immediately after where they violently draw attention to themselves in a diner, then bungle an execution in the car park outside!At the centre of the film is a gunfight with machine guns: an unpleasantly exciting experience. I don't remember hearing how many policemen die in this sequence: it probably doesn't matter. After this, we're in a revenge thriller, with De Niro mopping up the pieces, taking on the usual superhuman characteristics of the avenger. Exciting of course, but not to be taken seriously.What Mann does is whip the thing along: his vision of LA is awesome, and even his interiors are energised with a super-elevated style.Other reviewers have cited this film as a demonstration of the grey area that lies between good and evil. It's a film about Pacino in midlife finding prey finally worthy of himself, his equal in expertise, and the basic excitement that this hunt produces. The protagonists are joined by their indulgence in the hunt and the violence, but not their motivation, the job to be done, which makes the moral distinction.",Null,0,0,15 July 2000
The Cabin in the Woods," Scoobless
","**SPOILERS** I was surprised to find that 'twist' is a misnomer when applied to this movie, as the 'unconventional' concept is revealed from the outset: 5 American college students in what appears to be a traditional horror scenario turn out to have been unknowingly manipulated for the purposes of what may be a kind of extreme reality TV show. (Perhaps the real purpose of the 'TV show' is meant to be the twist?) I am a fan of the ultimate 'Cabin in the Woods' movie, The Evil Dead, and unfortunately the first part of this movie is like a watered down, lukewarm version of that- call it a homage if you like. Unfortunately the 'Reality TV' aspect of the movie distanced me even more from the action: because the horror was 'manipulated' and 'fake' I didn't care about it. I was very bored by this and waited for it to be over with so we could get to the part where the characters inevitably find out what's going on and get behind the scenes...When we finally get there, the action-packed finale is quite amusing, but at the same time pretty cheap. Little or no attempt seemed to be made to make those 'cells' realistic, and it really depends on how you view CGI creatures: for me it became cartoon time.Finally, I'd say that it is a big mistake for any movie maker to present us with a hero who is basically a Scoobless version of 'Shaggy' yet with less depth.Yup, perhaps the buzz about the movie made me expect something with more depth, and I'd probably have been more satisfied if I'd been geared up for what it was: a silly horror-comedy-homage.",4,14,26,25 April 2012
