The Blair Witch Project," Pleasantly Scared
","I saw this movie in Austin at the Dobie.  I had been waiting for months for this film and I was not disappointed.  Alot of the scares actually came from the film-makers reactions, feeling of hopelessness and dread of the dark. This film plays heavy on your fear of the dark, scaring you the way you used to scare yourself when you were 5 and in the dark.  The last 20 minites totally steal the show in feelings of panic and dread.  I highly recommend catching this flick when it goes wide release on the 30. Hell, some movie companies are maneuvering their releases so they  don't have to compete with the wide release. Like Mystery Men and Deep Blue Sea.
Go see it. Casey",8,1,1,24 July 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Breath Taking
",I never wanted this movie to end.  The House of Blue Leaves scene itself was worth the price of admission.  This movie was pure fun(although I felt self-conscience when I was giggling with delight and the carnage she was inflicting on the Crazy 88s).  I can't recommend this film enough,10,0,1,11 October 2003
