Iron Man 3," It's OK, but not as good as Dragonball Evolution
","This was probably the worst entry in the Iron Man series. It's even more disappointing since it was the first followup to the Avengers. You can't just go from great to average like that. And this was definitely an average film.1. The villain was horrible - What was he even trying to do? What were his motivations? It just seemed like everything he was doing was random. He seemed to have no plan at all.2. The acting - Look, Guy Pearce is actually a good actor, but I guess it was the script and the director because he was awful in this. I think he didn't know what he was getting himself into when he took on this role. I think he thought he was going to get good material to work with.Same goes for Ben Kingsley. Wonderful actor, horrible in this. Which is kinda ironic when you consider his character in the movie.I blame the writer and director.3. Dragged on, not funny - This movie should have been 1 hour and 30 minutes. That's pretty short for this type of movie, but you can blame the script for that. There were parts that were simply unnecessary, and there were supposed 'funny moments' that had me shaking my head.Some other things this movie had going for it. Anti-climatic, joyless, incoherent, and ridiculous. When did Tony Stark become James Bond? He's all of a sudden Ethan Hunt without the suit in this.Another thing I wanted to touch on. Stupidity. So Tony has this program, a fleet of Iron Man drones that he can call on at any point. He activates the program at the end for the final fight, but doesn't activate it when his house is under attack and both and Pepper might not make it out alive.There was also him destroying all the suits at the end. That made no sense at all.Overall this movie was just OK, but it's no Dragonball Evolution. Could have been much better.",Null,1,5,22 August 2013
Man of Steel," Extremely well done
","I loved the dynamic of Jonathan and Jor-El's role in Clark's life. Throughout the movie, Jonathan was really trying to hammer home the importance of secrecy, don't expose yourself to the world by using your powers.This of course led to a void being created in Clark. He's not about to go his entire life hiding his other half when he has such power and potential. Hence his argument with Jonathan in the car right before the tornado, he wants to know his purpose, he wants to fill the void. He went his whole life only half full.In comes Jor-El.**revealing the suit to Clark**'The symbol of the House of El means hope. Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief the potential of every person to be a force for good. That's what you can bring them.''You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.'Everything post-Jonathan's death was about filling that void. He was lost. He was searching for answers. He spent years and years searching. Where do I come from? Why was I sent here? What is my purpose? Jor-El helped fill the void. He gave Clark the second suit he so desperately needed.Jonathan shaped the Clark Kent persona, Jor-El shaped the Superman persona. Now Clark/Superman is complete. Very good dynamic to the movie having the two fathers shape the hero we know today. Extremely well done. The flashback scenes really helped flesh the character out.In addition to that aspect of the movie, the action was awesome. I'll have to give Synder and Goyer their props, this was a very well done movie.",Null,2,5,6 August 2013
