Saturday Night Fever," Dated, but crisp, appealing performance by Travolta
","John Travolta's high-octane performance took his stardom (earned on Welcome Back, Kotter) to otherworldly levels. His Tony Manero isn't a perfectly nice Brooklyn kid, but he's also not a rotten jerk. He's 19, has a job that he enjoys (selling paint at a hardware store), and at night he's the king of the dance floor at the height of the disco age.The movie is very dated - as most movies that rely on topical music score and fashion must be - but the theme runs true. Tony dances to build his own self-esteem, since he gets little in the way of positive enforcement from a family that dotes upon his older brother, a priest. He hangs with his arrested-development pals, drinking and dancing and carousing and fighting.Travolta is fantastic as Tony; he's not as loud and arrogant as his friends, but he's clearly their leader. He's not terribly bright, but he's smart enough to know his limitations. He's a little thoughtful, but not too reflective, choosing to live in the present. Until, that is, he meets the slightly older Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney).It's easy to see why audiences flocked to this one, with its strong soundtrack (all Bee Gees, all the time) and electric atmosphere. The movie's uncharacteristically well directed by John Badham, and Travolta's supporting cast is appropriate, not slipping into caricatures.",7,0,1,7 January 2006
Moneyball," On the money. Ball.
","I think the first thing you need to realize about Moneyball is that it's not really a baseball movie at all. It's about innovation in the face of intractable, tradition-bound, go-by-the-gut senses. New thinking versus old thinking. In presenting the view that concentrating on why a particular player is more valuable to a team than another, rather than on his star power or high-profile personality or the number of home runs he's hit is not only prudent but necessary when a team has little money to spend, the movie is an unqualified success. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt, nominated for an Oscar) is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a team with a small payroll that must compete with bigger-market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox. The Athletics are not unsuccessful, but they can't quite win it all. When three of their big stars leave via free agency one off season, Beane decides to replace them with players who are not only affordable but who can offer, in composite, more return than the departing trio. Beane's reasoning is that in order to win, a team must score runs. To score runs, a player must get on base. Getting on base is the single most important part of winning. So while other teams make use of players who can hit home runs and steal bases (and pay said players countless millions), Oakland goes after players who can simply get on base.That this is anathema to the Way the Game Is Played would be an understatement. No one's really paid attention to the more obscure statistics, like OBP (on-base percentage), because who cares? Give me 40 home runs and a 120 RBI, and we'll win. Well, Oakland can't afford that guy, so how about three guys who combined make less than that guy but get on base more often. That's more practical.Beane is assisted by virtually no one. His manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) despises Beane's attempts to manipulate the batting order to his liking. His scouts are all stuck in the mud of 1932 and refuse to change. Even the players are a little skeptical. But Peter Brand (Jonah Hill, also nominated for an Oscar), gets it. A true stats nerd – he majored in economics at Yale – Brand understands the weaknesses and strengths better than any general manager, field manager, or player ever could, because he's crunched the numbers and has data to back up his assertions.Pitt and Hill are both amazing and have excellent on-screen chemistry. That's not a sentence I figured I'd ever type. Hill isn't playing just some nebbish who cowers in front of Beane or a player; he's his own man, just a little withdrawn and seemingly out of his element. Both actors take great pains to involve the audience in their stories; otherwise, this would be just a movie about pencil-necked geeks playing simulated games on a computer and expecting the real world to do the same.The movie takes place in 2002 and is based on fact, but even so I won't spoil the ending for you now. But I will note this much for sure: Beane's overall philosophy has been adapted to such a wide extent over the past decade that Oakland now must find a new angle to exploit that the bigger teams haven't yet found. The very idea that there are more important stats than the typical power numbers turns baseball upside down, shakes it hard, and collects the loose change. To use a cliché, this was a teachable moment for baseball executives across America, and although it took a while for many to catch on, catch on they did.Even if one removed the many baseball scenes, the movie would still work. It's honest, true to itself, and doesn't digress into meaningless side plots, like forced romance or witty banter. But the baseball action, the result of Beane's work behind the scenes, sells it completely.",7,0,2,26 January 2012
The Avengers," Yup. They did it right.
","Guess I'll come out and say it right away: The Avengers may be the best superhero movie made to date. It has plenty of action, an understandable plot, multiple and discernible heroes, plenty of laughs, and terrific effects. Now, I'll admit it: everyone else seems to be saying the same thing. So do I need to maintain my integrity as an amateur reviewer- person by going against the grain and finding fault with the movie? Or can I feel secure in my own opinion, even if it's shared by fanboys and nonfans alike? (Hint: it's the latter.) Who are The Avengers, anyway? Well, there's Captain America (Steve Rogers), who's actually from the 1940s but was frozen for about seventy years. There's Iron Man (Tony Stark), a man in a weaponized metal suit. There's The Hulk (Bruce Banner), who smashes. There's Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), a superspy with some powers of her own. There's Hawkeye (Clint Barton), a master archer. And then there's Thor, a Norse god. We've been introduced to most of them already through their own films, so they seem like old pals to us. Helps cut down on backstory issues, anyway.It seems that Loki, the half-brother of Thor, has decided to open up a portal from his side of the universe to Earth itself, thus allowing a rampaging army of aliens to come in and slaughter us wholesale. Colonel Nick Fury, who's been recruiting our heroes to fight as a team, calls everyone in from wherever they were. They don't know each other, except by reputation. Can they stop bickering long enough to save the universe? It is possible.I mentioned before that our heroes are, well, discernible. This is no small feat, considering how many there are in the movie. Tony Stark is a narcissist. Steve Rogers is an anachronism. Bruce Banner has anger- management issues. Natasha is manipulative; Barton is manipulated. They're simultaneously human and superhuman.After assembling his team, Fury gives them the skinny. Banner's job is to find the Tesserac's location, an artifact that can produce immense power – or be wielded as an immense weapon. Supposedly, the Tesserac is high in gamma radiation, something Dr. Banner knows a little bit about. Meanwhile, the others are tasked with finding Loki, who's quite the badass. All of this is directed by Fury from a flying fortress that also can float. Kind of neat.Without the burden of needing backstories for everyone, writer/director Joss Whedon is free to throw thrills at us. The fight scenes are plausible and, at times, not at all cartoonish. This means that younger kids (it's a PG-13 movie) might find it a little intense. But there's very little blood, and what's seen is more like scratches on a face, or something. At any rate, although it's an unapologetically violent movie, it's carefully done; the amazing set pieces don't get in the way of a compelling story fraught with plenty of angst and anguish. This is how Transformers should have been.Boy, is there conflict. It's not as if the superheroes all show up mentally on board with Fury's plan. Not only are some of them mad at him, they snipe a little at each other. Sometimes this is the work of the masterful Loki; sometimes it's the natural difficult of strangers needing to form a cohesive unit.The acting is superb. Nick Fury is a role for which the estimable Samuel L. Jackson was born to play (and which he's played as a cameo in several movies already). Scarlett Johanssen picks up where she left off as Black Widow in Iron Man, and Robert Downey Jr., to no one's surprise, is effortlessly suave and jerkish as Stark. Chris Evans, as the idealistic Captain, and Chris Hemsworth, as the mighty but humbled Thor, are both terrific as well. Mark Ruffalo makes for a quietly intense Banner (and portrayed The Hulk via special effects). Jeremy Renner, seen very briefly in the Thor movie, is Hawkeye, a character with which most of us had had no prior exposure; Renner, however, gives his character so much depth that we're involved in his side story even more than we are with the others.So why wouldn't you watch this movie? It does have a lot of action, so if you hate that you should skip it. It's over two hours long, so if you don't like to sit, you should also skip it. It has strong female characters, hissable villains, heroes of all sizes, complicated love stories that sit in the background, and the fate of all mankind resting in the balance. Wait, I was supposed to be giving reasons not to watch it. Too bad, I've run out.",9,1,4,19 May 2012
Angels & Demons," Predictable, edgeless
","Ron Howard’s followup to The Da Vinci Code is an easy-to-follow, paint-by-numbers mystery thriller that probably would have received little recognition had it a) not been directed by Howard, b) not starred the redoubtable Tom Hanks, and c) used religion as its theme. All three elements contribute to form an overblown, frantic mess that offers little mystery.Robert Langdon (Hanks), the “symbologist” (not a real position) of The Da Vinci Code, is again the hero here, called into action by the Vatican itself, as four of its esteemed cardinals have been, um, cardinalnapped, just as an Conclave to choose the new Pope is about to begin. At the same time, an experiment at Switzerland’s CERN research center has produced a nifty new substance called antimatter - and it’s been stolen! By, it appears, whoever kidnapped the cardinal. The antimatter’s storage container must be found before midnight, or else the battery will run out, and everyone will be doomed.So it’s a race against the clock as Langdon and a beautiful CERN scientist (Ayelet Zurer) try to locate the container and save the cardinals. The mismatched duo - will they fall in love? - must match wits with some unseen wacko religious extremist, as well as the head of the Swiss Guard (Stellan Skarsgard). They’re helped by the youthful Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor), i.e., the Pope’s Helper fellow, and the chief of Vatican City’s police force (Pierfrancisco Favino) - or are they? The bad guy could be a good guy in disguise, right? Or did I just blow your mind? One thing that did bother me a lot about this movie - aside from the faceless, let’s-run-from-clue-to-clue plot device - is that for a movie that’s supposed to be peopled with Serious Folks who revere Important Things, sort of like Indiana Jones and his “it belongs in a museum!” mantra, there’s a LOT of desecration of religious artifacts, often for no good reason at all. Example: Langdon and his gal pal get access to the Vatican’s archives (of course they do) to look at one of Galileo’s original texts. The only one remaining in existence, right? In lieu of translating, they just rip a page out. Much light is made of the mysterious archives, and although I’m not remotely religious, this struck me as particularly disrespectful. Was Howard lampooning the Church, or was he trying to tell a good mystery tale? He succeeded only in doing the former, which is a huge disappointment.Hanks isn’t bad - better than he was in The Da Vinci Code, anyway - and his hair is less distracting here. He’s every bit as intrepid as you’d expect a Harvard professor to be in investigating a murder, which I’m sure is something that happens all the time to Harvard professors. Probably more than for Yale professors, anyway. So he’s not the problem, or even a problem. An issue, though, is that the characters are so thinly drawn. I mean, when you see two characters who seem a little dodgy, you know one of them will turn out to be not so dodgy, and maybe even a Good Guy after all. “Twists” like that can be spotted too far in advance for my tastes.If you took the core plot of “24″ and stripped away most of the tension and all of the character depth and added sacrilege, you’d get Angels and Demons. The book, as they say, is a heck of a lot better than the vapid movie version, but you probably assumed that anyway. What you might not have realized is that although this book was a lot better than the Da Vinci Code book, the movie is only marginally better than the DVC on film.",6,1,5,6 June 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Eh.
","My first thought is that this isn't nearly as good as the first one. But that's a little unfair, since the first one was (for me) an amazing film.Making a two-volume movie is a huge gamble. If the first one tanks, then no one's going to want to see the second one, which has likely already been filmed. If the first one is a rousing success, though, then it becomes the standard by which the second one is judged. For the filmmaker, this can be a losing proposition.The movie follows the revenge game played by The Bride (Uma Thurman), on her quest to find the man who ordered her wedding party slaughtered. Oh, and the man whose baby she was carrying when he put a bullet in her brain. Only the bullet didn't kill The Bride - it merely put her in a long coma. And when she woke up - look out!In the first film, The Bride tracked down two of her former compadres in killing as part of an elite hit squad. Now she has three names left on her list: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and her ex-boss and ex-lover, Bill (David Carradine).Quentin Tarantino takes an approach similar to the one he used to such great success in Pulp Fiction and that he reused in the first Kill Bill movie - scenes (chapters, in this case) that are shown to the audience out of order. Luckily, the scenes aren't so jumbled that the audience can't follow what's going on. In fact, the order rearranging is fairly tame by Tarantino standards.Tarantino does a great job in incorporating various movie genres into his film; it's part samurai thriller, part kung fu actioner, part cheesy, kitschy, zap-powie seventies schlock. He's always been proficient in this area; Pulp Fiction's characters at times seemed to be stuck in the seventies, but at the same time they didn't appear to be fish out of water. That's the genius of Tarantino.Where this film diverges from the first, however, is in its pacing. Volume 1 was chock full of fast-paced action scenes - The Bride taking on the Crazy 88 springs to mind - but while there are a few interesting, riveting scenes in Vol. 2, there aren't nearly enough of them. And because there are insufficient action scenes, there are plenty of times when the movie seems to flag a little. A lull in a Tarantino movie can be richly cultivated (remember the 'awkward silences' scene with Thurman and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction), but if there's nothing going on either above or below the surface, then the audience will get a little bored. Especially if they've been expecting wall-to-wall gore.The performances are rather remarkable, however. Thurman continues to amaze as The Bride (a character she and Tarantino came up with together). Quick - how many action movies can you name that had a strong female lead? Ok, now how many of those were any good? Thurman would have to be incredible in order to carry this film, and she doesn't disappoint in the least. Whereas she was a pleasant surprise in Vol. 1, we now expect her to do the same in Vol. 2, and she's up to the task.Equally up to the task is 67-year-old David Carradine. Yep, 67. I didn't realize he was such an old goat! And one look at him... well, let's just say Mr. Carradine has lived a hard life. Leathery and craggy, he's a Mount Rushmore of actors - and I don't mean in terms of professional stature. Carradine's quickly approaching his dad's prolific career (John Carradine appeared in around 500 movies). But he's found the role of a lifetime as Bill, and he commands every scene he's in. That velvety-smooth, world-weary voice disguises a malevolent scheming that lets you know he will persevere in the end. But does he? Doesn't the title belie that answer?Michael Madsen is just okay in his role as Bill's brother Budd, but that's not an insult. He's just Michael Madsen, turning in a performance one expects from Michael Madsen (who could forget him as Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs?).Another of Tarantino's more admirable traits is that he's able to get compelling performances of a lifetime from his actors. Take Daryl Hannah. Could anyone really have predicted she would even be IN this movie? The mermaid from Splash? But as Elle Driver, Hannah's cold, sexy.... and blind in one eye. (How she lost that one eye is explained, rather vividly.)Tarantino also loves to bring back moldy-oldie actors from Back in the Day, partly to revive their careers and partly as an homage to those older films he grew up with. This time around, he has Gordon Liu, who plays the mystical Pai Mei, who trained Bill's elite squad. We see some amazing scenes of The Bride being trained hard by Pai Mei, scenes that are of course reminiscent of all of the wise-master-training-young-hotshot kung-fu films (such as Jackie Chan's Drunken Master). We also see Bo Svenson as the reverend who's about to marry The Bride, and Michael Parks as old Bill friend Esteban Vihaio. Oh, and Sid Haig, whom I last saw in House of 1,000 Corpses, is barkeep at the nudie bar at which Budd's a bouncer.Aside from the sometimes-turgid pacing, another problem is the soundtrack. There were several times throughout the movie when the music was substantially louder than the dialogue on the screen! Now, I ask you - does that make any sense? Tarantino's always been a stickler for having the right song for the right scene, but come on - if I can't hear his strong dialogue, what's the point?I guess this film, in essence, didn't grab me as the first one did. I didn't leave the theater satisfied. I didn't leave with some of my favorite scenes still being played in my mind, over and over again. For me, the movie was flat and fell below expectations. It's still a well-done movie, but it's not up to Vol. 1's excellence.",6,1,3,20 April 2004
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Less action, more maneuvering, still quite good
","The third Hunger Games movie isn't quite like the first two. There are no Games, for one thing. For another, there's nowhere near the amount of action, as the tale focuses much more on the political machinations between the Capitol and the fabled District 13. And yet director Francis Lawrence does a fine job of presenting a gripping story that, like its predecessors, brings the heart-wrenching pain dappled with grand fire and brimstone. It's a rare 'tweener movie that can stand on its own, too.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), you've just blown a hole through the Hunger Games. Whaddya gonna do now? Hop on over to District 13, apparently, which is the home of those who are darn well fed up with the crazy shenanigans of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol. Katniss quickly learns that her fellow Games winner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is alive and well, sort of, doing propaganda interviews with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) in an attempt to get the rebel scum to lay down their weapons. Katniss, appalled at Snow's use of Peeta and at the destruction that the Capitol's military military has wrought, decides to become the Mockingjay, a true symbol around which the downtrodden, beaten-down residents of the not-well-off districts can rally.District 13 is run by President Coin (Julianne Moore), who's every bit as intelligent, strong, creative, and resourceful as you'd suspect Julianne Moore to be in real life. She's convinced by former gamesmaster Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) that Katniss should be welcomed into the district and become the new face of the rebellion. This, naturally, leads to Snow's use of Peeta as more of a personal propaganda weapon aimed at Katniss herself. But who's zoomin' whom? Peeta seems awfully convincing when he tells everyone to lay down their weapons and surrender. It's no wonder that the rebels see him as a tool of The Man and are out for his blood, right? With no games to carry the bulk of the movie, the run time is a little shorter (by about 20 minutes), but that doesn't mean there's no fighting going on. Katniss and her former boyfriend – or is it also future? – Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) are armed with a bow and a Big Gun, respectively, in defense of District 13. We may not get to see hand-to-hand combat, but at least we're not seeing children kill each other. In fact, this entry in the series features far fewer on-screen deaths. But rest easy, there are plenty of harrowing moments, because when one side has a metric ton of big weapons and you do not, you're likely to get stomped on a little bit.The decrease in violence allows the viewer an even better look at some truly terrific acting. The performances by Lawrence, Hoffman, Moore are all award caliber, and I don't mean 'for an action movie based on a young-adult movie,' either. They're really great, which isn't a big surprise considering the pedigree each possesses. Still, it's nice to see layered character development in a blockbuster, and if this were a more-typical drama, even more praise would be justly heaped upon the cast.Also along for the ride are Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) as the scraggly former Victor with more sense than he lets on; Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) as Katniss' fashion consultant, even in hiding; and Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), the former Tribute who's the tech wizard for District 13. They all have jobs to do in this new world order, and each job centers around making Katniss not into just a one-dimensional heroine for the world but to bring that heroine out of Katniss. You know, organically.I'll admit that the first twenty minutes or so felt a little slow. Not forced, just a stark contrast to the pulse-pounding action of the earlier movies. But then things kick into a whole 'nother gear once Katniss see what's become of her beloved District 12, reduced to rubble in the aftermath of the last Hunger Games. It's compelling, wrenching stuff, particularly when you realize that's not just rubble laying before Katniss.In all, I think Lawrence and company did an exemplary job. You know, it doesn't seem terribly difficult to stage manage action scenes – you let the tech guys do their thing and listen to your DP. But when you have to get your audience to identify with characters and relate to their plight, that takes a softer touch. And it's all well and good to just let Hoffman and Moore and Lawrence do their thing, but Lawrence also elicits fine, underplayed performances from Hutcherson, Hemsworth, Harrelson, and even Sutherland.",8,13,42,23 November 2014
Changeling," Jolie is magnificent
","A little boy is taken from his home in 1928. His mom enlists the LAPD to find him, and five months later they come up with a lost child. The mother quickly grasps that the kid isn't her missing son, but the LAPD will have none of it. Outraged, Christine Collins takes on the entire police department in an effort to get them to look for her son, much to the detriment of her own welfare.Oh, the arrogant LAPD! They foist a boy, obviously the wrong child, on poor Mrs. Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and practically force her to shower affection on the kid. Then they wash their hands of the matter, even when Collins protests that the kid's not hers. This attitude gets her thrown into a women's sanitarium, because you just didn't talk back to the LAPD in 1928, especially if you were a woman. Especially if you were a single woman who was pointing out a huge mistake on the part of the LAPD.Luckily, Christine has a powerful ally, the Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who broadcasts a weekly sermon excoriating the police for corruption and other misdeeds. Briegleb is instrumental in winning Christine's release, but the battle's only just begun: the cops are still crooked, and she is still without her son.Concurrent to Christine's problems, we also follow the story of the real kidnapper and of the upper management of the LAPD. What begins as a slight cover-up on the part of the all-powerful police in order to placate a testy public and press turns into a disaster, all because Christine Collins wouldn't give up.The movie is never lacking for emotional realism. First of all, you completely empathize with Christine Collins, a woman who refuses to be a victim. Her goal isn't to bring the police department down, and it's not even to exact some kind of vengeance (which might just be a way for her to get over her son's kidnapping). Her goal is simply to get her son back.Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins and is, in a word, outstanding, and she earned a Oscar nomination for this movie. Jolie's Collins is not homely - you can't completely lose that beauty, even if you're playing a somewhat dowdy 1920s mom - but her looks don't get her anywhere in this movie. To tell the truth, her looks are never even mentioned, not even in a snide comment by the cops ('Just sit over here, cutie, while we men take care of things'). When Collins comes home to find her son's gone, we feel the anguish she feels. It doesn't feel forced, and we don't feel manipulated, and that's at least because of Jolie herself.One odd little complaint, though - why is everything so dark? Was the sun dimmer in 1928? Even in broad daylight, everyone seems to be half in shadows, which made me squint most of the time, thus giving me a headache. Was director Clint Eastwood trying for some kind of period moodiness? It's not needed for most of the scenes, although the mental hospital should, by definition, be poorly lit.As Christine Collins tenaciously clings to the idea that her son may still be alive, the movie also grabs a hold of your heartstrings and never lets go. But neither does Eastwood try to manipulate us toward an inevitable conclusion; he doesn't pluck those heartstrings so much as gently caress them, ambiguously leading us in multiple directions. Collins' predicament feels terrifyingly real: the aching loss of her only child and her own violent incarceration in a sadistic 'hospital.' Changeling is frightening not only because of the blistering account of evil cops and doctors but also, and most hauntingly, because of the horrible anguish and despair Collins feels as she fights the system while maintaining her resolute belief that her boy will be found.",8,3,4,29 June 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Exceeds low expectations
","Let's face it. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies aren't really awful, but they are no longer the ground-breaking spectacle that the original was. So it was with lowered expectations that I watched the latest effort, and I can gladly say that the movie exceeded those low expectations. Damning with faint praise? Yes.This time around, we've lost the characters of Will and Elizabeth, which is a good thing. I don't know about the rest of you, but I was getting tired of the triangle they formed with Jack Sparrow. The two characters were just getting annoying and in the way of Johnny Depp, so when their stories were pretty definitively ended at the conclusion of the third movie, I was happy. Taking Elizabeth's place as the story's heroine is Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard and played by the luminous Penelope Cruz. Like Elizabeth Swan, Angelica can kick butt and take names; the difference is that Cruz is far more convincing in the role than Keira Knightley ever was in her. Cruz's presence gives the franchise a much-needed jolt of fiery Latin temper, to use a cliché that happens to fit nicely here.As for the character of Will Scarlett, the noble Everyman/blacksmith played by Orlando Bloom, his replacement would probably be the clergyman who finds himself in the service of Blackbeard, trying valiantly to 'save' him. As the movie progressed, I began to sense that Philip the Good would somehow let slip the bonds of his faith and fall for someone. I knew that someone wouldn't be Angelica the daughter of Blackbeard, and a quick glance at the trailer showed me his eventual target. So, like Scarlett before him, Philip finds love where he never thought he'd find it. Trouble is, that relationship was starkly uninteresting to me. I'm not sure if Sam Claflin, who played the character, or the screenwriters, is to blame, but boy and howdy was that part of the plot a giant bore. If there's a Pirates 5 – and who are we kidding, of course there must be – I hope Philip and his new love don't make an appearance.So what made this one palatable, anyway? You minus the two more wearisome characters from the last one and add a temptress, and you're good to go. Plus you add in Ian McShane as the diabolical Blackbeard, and he's an actual bad guy, unlike Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who's jumped sides about as often as Jack Sparrow himself – and here begins the movie in the employ of the British King.The stunts are well staged as usual, and good use was made of the location shooting on Oahu and Puerto Rico. Never let it be said that a Pirates movie wasn't fun to look AT. But an added benefit for me was that I watched the movie in 2D, even though it was also available in 3D. Why, you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked, Imaginary Reader. You see, when a movie is shot in 3D, the 3D process absorbs some of the light; therefore, if a movie features scenes in darkened environs – like caves, the ocean blue, underwater, jungles – then it'll be so dark that one will have a lot of trouble seeing what's going on. And for this you'd pay an extra few dollars. Ain't worth it. So if you do see this in 3D, you may want dial this rating down a notch.Overall, the movie – and the franchise – owes quite a bit to Mr. Depp. Yes, he IS Jack Sparrow, and it's impossible to imagine the movie without him. And even though this is his fourth go-round as Sparrow, Johnny Depp's enthusiasm doesn't seem to flag a bit; he sells the character wholeheartedly and joyfully. He is, as usual, a lot of fun to watch.Oh, yes, the plot. Nutshell: Barbossa (with the British), the Spanish, and Blackbeard (with zombies on his crew, of course) are all trying to find the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow had the map, Mr. Gibbs – Sparrow's first mate all these movies – memorized it and burned it, and there you go. And there's a prophecy about a one-legged man, and there are mermaids. It's like Harry Potter without house elves.",6,4,5,31 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Much better than #2 - solid and entertaining
","A significant upgrade over part II, Men in Black III offers a plausible plot, the usual engaging performances from Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, and awesome-looking aliens. It's a keeper.This time around, the taciturn K (Jones) finds himself the target of the nefarious Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement), a bad, bad alien who's just broken out of the maximum-security prison designed to hold him on the Moon. Turns out Boris isn't just out to get K, though; he plans to travel back in time to when K arrested him (and shot his arm off) and kill him there. This, of course, leads to a time-travel journey taken by Agent J (Smith), who must stop Boris before he messes up the future for K - and instigates a full-scale alien invasion in the present day. It's the kind of movie that doesn't need to try too hard to win an audience over. We know the characters; put them in an interesting situation, and everything works out fine. Some movies throw in the figurative kitchen sink, the better to confuse the audience into thinking everything means something - when, in fact, nothing means a darn thing. MIB doesn't bother with trickery. The personalities of J and K - well established and reflective of the public perception of Messrs. Smith and Jones - meld so seamlessly and are so symbiotic that the actual plot is almost (almost) relegated to the background.Remember, it can be difficult to create a decent third film in a series. There are no surprises with the characters, and presumably we know all about someone's backstory. In MIB III, though, we do learn a little bit about Agent K's past. But thanks to a vibrant script by Joel Coen, that past history is more complementary than front and center. I think a focus on just K's 1969 life would have made for a pretty dull movie. I mean, it's not as if he's Mr. Excitement, right?Clement is a terrific, terrible villain as the monstrous Boris the Animal ('It's just BORIS!'); he has this nifty parasite thing that lives in his remaining hand, and when he aims the hand at someone, a dart shoots out. Pretty cool. Emma Thompson is also on board as the new head of the MIBs (her name? O, of course. Get it? O and K?); former leader Zed (Rip Torn) has passed away. Alice Eve plays the 1969 version of O as well. An undercomplicated plot doesn't mean that the special effects are blasted in your face, though. In fact, they're kept at a minimum, again lending support to the charisma of Jones and Smith instead of supplanting it. There are some cool transportation devices in 1969 (but not in the current day, weird), and the time-travel device itself is wacky (it's a time JUMP, literally). The effects feel as if they're meant to be there, not that they're shoehorned in to make things look pretty. And that's a positive development.Men in Black III is a typical, solid blockbuster action movie. Not all action movies can stand up to much scrutiny, and if you're Michael Bay they don't stand up to any scrutiny at all, not when your third act is always Blow Stuff Up. This is an audience pleaser with a fascinating plot, amiable performances, good effects and set pieces, and some funny dialog to boot.",7,1,3,26 May 2012
Scarface," Some rise, some fall, some climb...
","Certainly, how much you enjoy this movie will depend mostly on how much you enjoy Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana. If you find Tony to be a bit too over the top, perhaps a caricature of 80s bad guy, then you're likely to find Scarface to be a one-dimensional, overblown piece of fluff. But if you think Tony is a major badass whose overreactions help enhance his character, not detract from it, then Scarface is your movie. The movie is still very quotable, even 36 years later! And it's educational. Never sample your own product. Good life lesson right there, kids. Anyway, I fall into the second group. Yeah, it's outlandish theater, but it somehow works - particularly as it's set in the overwhelming 1980s. Of course, fresh-off-the-boat Tony is a cocky bastard, even with the immigration guys. Of course, he blusters his way into a coke deal, which quickly goes south. Of course, he fights his way to the top of the crime game. He's all cojones; just ask him. Couple of other notes - the entire cast is a lot of fun, from Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio (playing his kid sister) and Michelle Pfeiffer (playing his wife) to Robert Loggia (his boss) and F. Murray Abraham (boss' right-hand man). Steven Bauer, playing Tony's own right-hand man, is okay, but am I the only one who sees a resemblance to Michael Ian Black? I will say that Tony's act of bulldozing over everyone and disregarding all help got a bit tiresome, but that's in keeping with his character, anyway. For me, this version of Scarface is good but not a huge classic - just a good representation of the decadent 80s from Brian DePalma. Almost a time capsule of same, really.",6,1,1,11 July 2019
Walk the Line," Amazing performances
","If you'd told me, oh, a year ago that there would be this big-budget movie about Johnny Cash, and it would star Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, there's no way I would have been looking forward to seeing it. Joaquin Phoenix, the bad guy in Gladiator, as Cash? Reese Witherspoon, the cutie pie in Legally Blonde, as June Carter? It would have sounded like a flop borne of hubris and greed.But Phoenix and Witherspoon turn in incredible performances, surely the best of their short careers and among the very best of the year. Phoenix IS Cash - singing the Man in Black's song in perfect imitation. Witherspoon is smashing in what's hopefully a breakout role for her, after so many fluffy, nondescript comedies.Like most biopics, this is a story of redemption, of rising and falling and finding that those who remain with you in your time of need are the ones that should be kept around, their reluctance to do so be damned. We follow Johnny from his early childhood, including the tragic loss of his brother and the rejection of his father, to his opportune recording for Sam Phillips, and his meeting, courtship of, touring with, and proposal to June Carter. In between, we get a pretty good glimpse, courtesy of Phoenix's stunning performance, of the ghosts that haunted Cash throughout his life.It's no surprise that the music is so good, since they're all old Cash tunes, but the fact that Joaquin Phoenix is singing them does offer up a bit of a curveball. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon so completely immerse themselves in the well-known characters of Johnny and June that one would almost expect some caricature, but there's nary a dishonest, insincere beat to their incredible work here.Director James Mangold, who previously directed Girl, Interrupted, hits no false notes here, where even the slightest misstep might have had rabid Cash fans clamoring for his head on a spike. Vividly shot, the film is highly evocative; you feel at times that you're crawling inside Cash's brain, the atmosphere is so intense.And although this is a movie about a man's rising from his own ashes, one of its core themes is also its most wonderfully realized, that of true love and friendship. June Carter stands by her man through all of the bad times, even when his family, particularly his shrewish wife, abandon him out of selfishness and spite. From the first moment Witherspoon and Phoenix share the screen, you can tell they're made for each other, with dazzling chemistry that ultimately lifts the movie to its greatest heights.",8,6,9,3 March 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Watching glorious Borat movie yes!
","If you like side-splitting hilarity that's based on stuff happening to unsuspecting people (otherwise known as rubes or marks), then Borat (and its unwieldy full title) is perfect for you.Borat is a mockumentary starring the title character (Sacha Baron Cohen), a television reporter in Kazakhstan who journeys to the United States in an effort to explain the 'greatest country' to his audiences back home. Zany hijinks ensue.Borat begins his trek in New York, but when he happens upon an episode of Baywatch in his hotel room. Ah, he spies the luscious Pamela Anderson in her role as CJ the Awesome Lifeguard. Well! That does it for the general-interest piece he was gonna do - he (and his cameraman, and his producer) is off to California! Let the sojourn begin! Now, bear in mind that (apparently) the interactions Borat has with various Americans, of all shapes, sizes, and colors, are completely unscripted on the part of the naive citizenry. Borat travels to a rodeo, where he 'sings' the Kazakh national anthem to - get this - the tune of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' and to the Deep South, where he receives etiquette lessons and attends a social gathering. He and his crew even get lost in Atlanta, where Borat not only gets directions but also some helpful hints on sartorial goodness from some locals.The jokes and jibs always seem accidental, as if Borat is simply this unknowing foreigner who is not wise in American ways. At the same time, the proverbial seedy underbelly of Americans (that is, unseen bigotry) is gleefully, manically exposed; one gets the feeling that those who are exposed have no idea what's happening. They're just being themselves.Everything about this movie hinges on Cohen's performance, naturally. If Borat's sexist, racist, anti-Semitic, boorish-yet-innocent persona grates, then the movie's lost to you. And there's Borat in a nutshell - he's all these ugly, nasty things, but he doesn't know he is. Why, he's just Borat, a typical Kazakh peasant. He can't be expected to know of our mores and rules, can he? Why, of course not. (In one memorable exchange, Borat is aghast that women in America can choose with whom they wish to have sex!) There will be some who simply won't like this movie. Those people either don't get the idea of the Borat character or don't have much of a sense of humor to begin with. If Bert from Sesame Street were real, he'd probably wander out of the theater after watching Borat with Ernie, shaking his head, wondering what it was all about. Whereas Ernie would be laughing his furry red ass off.",8,4,12,5 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," That's Not Incredible
","Did I ask for a Hulk “reboot”? Did anyone? I guess they felt that the last one, succinctly titled Hulk, was somewhat lacking. But perhaps it just wasn’t meant to be; here we are, just a few years later, and the new Hulk movie is about as lifeless and predictable as the first, only with A-list actors suffering within it. The Incredible Hulk is ambitious but no more compelling or vivacious as an actual comic book, with one-dimensional characters and a perfectly horrendous stab at acting by the normally reliable William Hurt.I remember that one of the big knocks against Hulk was the unconvincing CGI. I think that problem is more or less resolved here, as the new and improved Hulk looks terrifyingly real, not just an ogre with a soft center but really menacing. Sadly, though, this Hulk has more personality and joie de vive than any of his live-action counterparts. It’s perplexing, really, because this time around the studio opened up the checkbook for such bankable stars as Hurt, Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and Tim Roth. They’re all out acted by the fx (save Norton, who’s just as effortlessly wonderful as always), which has to be a jolt to the ol’ ego, but none greater than to Hurt, who has decades of flavorful, heavily nuanced performances on his resume.As with most superheroes, Hulk is completely misunderstood. Bruce Banner has inflicted a metric ton of gamma rays on himself in the interest of science, only to find out the military for which he worked really wants to weaponize him, so he’s hiding out in Brazil when the movie opens. Somehow, he has to get information back to an unknown scientist contact, before the army, led by General Ross (Hurt), finds him first. He also wants to reconnect with his girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who happens to be Ross’ daughter. But darn the luck, he can’t keep his heart rate low enough to avoid Hulking all over the place. So it’s an protracted chase scene, with the faceless, heartless military running after the green thing.There’s a wild card here, too. If you’ve read the comic books, you know there’s always gonna be another Big Bad Guy to fight someone like Hulk, because sooner or later watching him swat away missiles like he’s King Kong gets kind of dull. So writers gin up an even bigger dude for him to fight. Here, he’s played by Tim Roth, who’s a major following Ross’s orders.The CGI still isn’t terribly believable, but sinking this one even further is the illogic of the plot. I love how nothing ever seems to hurt Hulk - bullets, shotgun shells, tanks, helicopters, they all roll off him and explode in a huge blast. But they keep firing anyway. Oh, and General Ross just keeps calling in bigger artillery. It ain’t working, fool! But the best is that of course only Hulk and Hulk alone can stop Roth, even if he’s not Hulky. Of course only he can save the day, him and his purple pants.I still can’t get over the fact that William Hurt is playing this blustery, distant, single-minded authority figure. Was Powers Boothe not available? Kurtwood Smith? R. Lee Ermey? When I think of William Hurt, I think of quiet intellectualism. Sure, sometimes his characters are cold and aloof, but they’re still sensitive and pining and not at all like the overreaching, despotic Ross. Weird casting doesn’t always work, you know.Norton does his level best, but the movie’s just a shambles. It’s stereotypical comic-book fare, only it’s not terribly interesting, and the effects are more akin to a good video game than an expensive Hollywood movie.",4,1,3,3 December 2008
Mission: Impossible III," A little flat, standard
","I like to think I can separate an actor's public rantings from his or her on screen work. I'd like to think that, but I'm not that much of a professional. The truth is, when an actor becomes overexposed or otherwise annoying, it registers in the back of my mind. So the next time I see them in a movie, that dormant part of my brain thinks, 'This person's irritating!' And so it is with Tom Cruise. Poor Tom! He's in the papers more for his shenanigans than for his oeuvre. Couch hoppin', medication dissin', baby makin', and brainwashin', that's our Tom. Kind of puts a few dents in his long-cultivated image of Tom Cruise, Actor Man. So, unfortunately, I sat down to watch M:I-3 already prejudiced against Mr. Cruise.But regardless of how you may feel about Tom cruise, Actor Man, the movie itself just isn't all that good. It's bombastic, trying desperately to distract you with noise, noise, and more noise, so much of it you'll feel numb afterwards. The Mission: Impossible movies are swirls of gunfire, explosions, and grit, but without much in the way of substance - or plausibility.In this installment, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has left IMF for a new career as a trainer, and he's fallen for a pretty nurse named Julia (Michelle Monaghan). He's done, he's out, he's moving on - except, oops, they've brought him back in. Seems an agent's been captured, and for some unknown reason only Ethan and his old team can retrieve her. This is just the first improbability to hit the plot.Hunt's nemesis this time around is black-market dealer Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who's after something called the Rabbit's Foot, and Hunt has to stop him. Has to, you see, because Davian's got his new bride, and he's not messing around, understand? A running theme in recent Cruise films has been that his characters always get set up by someone. Mission: Impossible. Minority Report. Vanilla Sky. This one, too, sadly, but it's not really a surprise. The man is just a bit too trusting.There are some whaddya-kidding-me moments, such as when one character, having seconds earlier been taught how to fire a gun, shoots a few guys dead without so much as wasting a shot. You know, believable stuff like that. But mostly the action comes at you so quickly that you don't have time to ponder the holes in the plot. Ah, but just when you're figuring it's a lot of sound and fury, there will be a scene that completely stops that ill-gotten momentum in its tracks, as shots linger on expressionless faces for no apparent reason other than to give us a chance to grab some snacks.With the third director in the series, it seems the M:I movies try a little too hard to top each other (not to mention their contemporaries) in terms of visual effects. Cruise is still a good action hero and leading man, and he can certainly carry a picture even if his star has dimmed somewhat. Frankly, he's a little more believable in these thrill rides than he is in the 'small' movies, like Collateral or Vanilla Sky; when the plot gets center stage, he simply doesn't have the range.M:I-3 isn't a total waste of time, but it's no longer fresh and exciting; it has its own minilegacy that it must live up to. Judged thusly, it's probably a good thing (for it) that the movie debuted in theaters before the new X Men movie.",6,2,4,16 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," More or less hits the mark; Hartnett a surprise
","Poor Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett). He's just lost his girlfriend and his job, and when he jets to New York to stay with a friend for a while, he finds himself mistaken for his now-missing friend by the heads of two crime syndicates, each of whom wants to use Slevin for their own nefarious purposes.On the one hand, there's The Boss (Morgan Freeman). Seems Nick, Slevin's missing bud, owes The Boss a lot of money. The Boss knows Slevin's not Nick, but what can he do? Slevin's just in the wrong place (Nick's apartment) at the wrong time (the present). The Boss also knows Slevin has no money, so he offers to forgive Nick's debt to Slevin (i.e., not kill Slevin, which is important) if Slevin does a little favor for him. That favor, of course, is killing the son of The Boss's biggest enemy, The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley).The Rabbi, meanwhile, tells Slevin that Nick owes him money, too, and he gives Slevin a short time to come up with the cash. So now Slevin has to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars and kill someone. Good thing he's not alone; Nick's neighbor, the vivacious Lindsey (Lucy Liu), concerned about Nick's absence, helps Slevin investigate and contemplate. Also thrown into the mix is a double-dealing hit man named Goodkat (Bruce Willis); no filme noirish movie would be complete without one.The movie feels a little perplexing for the first three-quarters, but then all of a sudden Things Make Sense. And not in a contrived, force-fed sense, either; it all falls into place. That's one of the debits of the movie, though; there aren't loose ends, there aren't endless possibilities, there aren't nebulous motives, and so forth. It's all too blunt, too black-and-white without even a hint of gray sneaking in from the side.Hartnett's not bad at all, though, which surprised me a great deal. I've always thought of him as a squinty-eyed dim bulb, frankly. He just seemed like a Big Dumb Guy, kind of like Ben Affleck. But Hartnett turns in a pretty amiable performance in the lead role, although the role was written as a little too glib for my tastes. (Slevin's nonchalant, unserious attitude seems more off-putting and distracting than colorful, even if it's partially explained later on.) Praise should go to an able supporting cast, especially the adorable Liu and the trenchant Freeman. Stanley Tucci, who plays a detective trying to sort out the mess, is also superb as always, as is Kingsley. Even Willis, who by now can do these roles in his sleep, manages to inject some life into his rather low-key scenes.All in all, the movie - despite its cumbersome title - is a bit better than I expected. The plot is fairly solid and believable, and the movie is well cast, even in the key role of the titular Slevin.",7,1,3,28 September 2006
Captain Phillips," Near the top of the Hanks ladder
","Based on true events, Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is the rarest of thrillers, the kind that relies on neither distracting special effects nor circumspect character development. Driven by a powerful, soul-baring performance by the inimitable Tom Hanks, the movie never lags, never oversells the plight of its characters, never reduces anyone or anything to mere caricature.Hanks is the titular captain of the United States container ship MV Maersk Alabama, cruising along the coast of Somalia with a full load and heading toward the horn of Africa. Two skiffloads of armed Somalis close in, ready to board the vessel. They're pirates, working for a warlord in their impoverished country, and they smell opportunity.If this were a standard action flick, we might see the heroism of Phillips and his motley crew as they fight the evil pirates and save the world. It's not so here. There are nuances afoot; for once, we get the perspective of the lead pirate (Barkhad Abdi) without falling into the easy trap of feeling empathy toward him. The pirates board the giant ship, clearly pleased with their find. Muse (Abdi) quickly proves himself to be a strong, humanistic leader; he's single minded (where's the crew? where's the goods?) but not sinister. His gang includes a strong man with a quick temper and Muse's own relative, who'd begged to come along on the mission - a mission that, when successful, would go a long way to improving their lives. The movie is told in two distinct halves: the time spent by the pirates on the Maersk as they search in vain for treasure and crew, and the time spent in the ship's lifeboat as they make their way to Somalia. The villains are conflicted and desperate. And armed. But they're quickly immersed in an impossible situation. This is one of the toughest, most naked performances of Hanks' stellar career. It's sometimes painful and heart wrenching to watch. He's an Everyman, per usual, but he's not also a savior or a hero. He doesn't suddenly develop super strength and overpower the bad guys. He's just a guy in charge of a boat and its passengers. Matching him wit for wit while frantically trying to keep his own wits about him is Abdi as the skinny, intelligent Muse, seemingly a veteran of high piracy (though not against huge container ships). Abdi is a wonder to watch; unpredictable and cunning but a little greedy and rapidly running out of viable options. Truly a talent to look out for, Abdi nails this role.The ending is predictable only in the most general sense. Bill Ray's screenplay does not duck some plausible consequences to the actions of each main player and leaves us with a scene that is as emotionally overpowering as anything in Hanks' previous Philadelphia. It seems that every time Tom Hanks makes a good movie, people begin to label it as 'Oscar bait,' as if the movie were created just as a vehicle to earn an award. Captain Phillips delivers a tight, action-packed story fraught with none of the usual missteps of the genre, and if it is indeed rewarded with the highest of honors, it will be well deserved.",9,289,358,10 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overhyped? Nahhh!! Feed me, O Lord Lucas!
","Well, it always happens, doesn't it? You wait, and you wait, and you wait for something, and inevitably it doesn't turn out to be nearly as good as you wanted it to be. The Phantom Menace is by no means a failure, but it does have some problems. Probably the best way to look at it is to compare it to other sci-fi films, not to other Star Wars movies. It's going to suffer in comparison to the others in the series, but it IS better than most of the sci-fi drek that's out there.If you have not seen the first three (or is that the second three?) Star Wars movies, two things come to mind. First, WHY NOT? Second, you won't understand a lot of the nuances of this latest installment, in which case you shouldn't even bother with this review; you should check yourself into a halfway house that'll make you watch each Star Wars movie over and over again for 24 hours straight.Now, for those of you who did see the other movies, and somehow avoided this one when it was in the theater (shame on you!), rest easy. You'll probably still enjoy it on the small screen, provided your small screen isn't a 10-inch black and white number. The effects come across surprisingly good on TV. What's really interesting, though, is that when Star Wars first came out in 1977, the special effects were about two decades ahead of their time. Now, the effects are still state-of-the-art, but the rest of the industry is a lot closer to George Lucas's company now than it was 22 years ago, so we're not as overwhelmed as we were then.I won't bore you with plot details. Let's just say there are a lot of droids, there are empathetic, Ewok-like beings, there are lightsaber duels, and there are some cool battle scenes. What slows this production down a little are the incongruity of the Jar Jar Binks character (WHY?), and the somewhat slow pacing. For the other Star Wars movies, it felt like a lot of action was packed into a 100-minute movie; for Phantom Menace, it seemed like a lot of non-action was packed into a 120-minute movie.
Bottom line is this: When I saw this movie in the theaters, I loved it! Not as good as the first or third Star Wars movies, but still very good. And now that I have it on video, I'm gonna love it even more often.",7,1,2,9 April 2000
Sucker Punch," Mixed bag, but still great to look at
","Sucker Punch is really two movies. One is pretty dang impressive, especially from a visual standpoint, and the other is really just mediocre. Combined, they make a half-decent film. It's one of those movies that looks so good and is set against a backdrop with sufficient surreality that one can easily not only suspend disbelief but also expel it, semipermanently, from one's mind.A diminutive girl (Emily Browning) is thrown into an insane asylum by her evil stepfather after she accidentally kills her younger sister while defending her from his advances. Once in there, she's befriended/mocked/ostracized/encouraged by a group of young ladies, led by Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). The asylum, we quickly learn, is really a very expensive brothel, and the girls earn their keep.When the girl, named Baby Doll, is asked to dance during the girls' ballet practice by their taskmaster teacher Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino), she retreats into an imaginary world that would put make Alice's Wonderland look like a trip to JC Penney's. Within this fantasy world, Baby Doll learns from a wise man (Scott Glenn) that she will need to locate certain artifacts in order to make her escape. When she comes out of her reverie – to much applause, as apparently her dance was just that good – Baby Doll has formed her plan.Imagination is a powerful tool. Each time Baby Doll dances, she is able to get closer to her ultimate goal. But she isn't alone, not even in these fantasies – she is joined by Sweet Pea, Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung). One moment they're fighting the Germans in a steampunk warfront, the next they're in a Lord of the Rings setting, and so on, all to get those artifacts. That's the good, impressive movie. The meh one is the plot line outside of those fantasy scenes. True, the actresses all seem to have good chemistry with one another, but what we basically get is an evil asylum leader with lascivious intentions that are eclipsed only by his unmitigated greed. We do get quite a bit of urgency, too, as Baby Doll is scheduled for a lobotomy in just five days' time. And while Oscar Isaac, as bad guy Blue Jones, is hissable as a villain, there's almost no depth to his character at all, making his scenes with the girls excruciating and pointless to watch.Here's something I did find a little odd. Browning, all bright eyed and bushy tailed, looked to me to be in her mid teens, an older sister to a single-digit sib. But when she's checked into the asylum by her stepfather, her age is given as 20. I don't know if Browning, who really is 22, looked 20 in this movie. But maybe that's a minor quibble.The visuals will remind you of director Zack Snyder's earlier work with 300 and Watchmen, with maybe a smidge of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Sweeping, violent, visceral war scenes, improbable action, the works. When the girls descend to kick ass – be the ass German, robot, orc, what have you – their movements are even less believable than those of the Crazy 88s in Kill Bill Vol. 1. But that's intentional, and here it works.Overall, Sucker Punch is entertaining, and it delivers on its own premise. It's full of truly astounding cinematography, spectacular but not dizzying, and it features some pretty damn commanding performances, particularly by Browning, Cornish, and Malone.",7,2,4,29 March 2011
3:10 to Yuma," Yuma wanna watch this
","This remake of the 1957 oater (that's movie talk for 'western') is serviceable largely because of the earnest craftiness of its two leads, who skillfully play off each other in a battle of wills, if not morals. Unfortunately, while the motives of the good guy (playes by Christian Bale) are both noble and realistic, some of the actions of the bad guy (Russell Crowe) may leave you scratching your head, and while nebulous intentions can make for wonderful mystery, in the end you're still not sure why Crowe's dastardly Ben Wade has done what he's done, and what it all means.Dan Evans (Bale) is a dirt-poor farmer who lost a leg in the Civil War. His farm's about to be foreclosed by an unscrupulous land owner who's taken to damming a river and burning down Evans' barn to force him off his own property. So when stagecoach robber Ben Wade (Crowe) is captured and needs to be escorted to the nearby town to get on the titular train, Evans volunteers, both to gain payment to help save his farm and to save face in front of his two kids, one of whom is sick from tuberculosis and one who thinks his old man is a spineless failure. Saddled by debt and ungrateful kids, Evans' decision and motivation is easy to understand.Ah, but getting the nefarious Wade to Yuma is going to be a complicated trick indeed, because the rest of his gang, led by Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) isn't going to let their fearless leader be trundled off to Yuma to die. Luckily, bounty hunter Byron McElroy (a gritty Peter Fonda) gets the idea of using a decoy stagecoach to lure the varmints off the trail while he and the rest of the posse, including Evans, schlep Wade in the other direction. The gambit works for a while, allowing the good guys to place precious geographical space between them and the bad guys; it also allows the movie to continue unabated. Because, after all, there are more people in Wade's gang then there are trying to bring him to justice - all they'd have to do is find him, shoot the hell out of the place, and grab him.Although there's plenty of gunplay and death by bullets, this is much more of a psychological drama than anything else. Wade, as played coldly (but not charmlessly) by Crowe, has two goals in mind: gain the mental upper hand on Evans, an untrained rancher, and gain his escape from the clutches of law and order. Meanwhile, although Evans' intentions are less murky, he's not some squinty-eyed sharpshooter whose aim is always true; he's not an iconic hero who you just know is gonna save the day. Bale is terrific; you can really see the anguish he feels as a supposed failure in the eyes of his sons. In the hands of lesser actors, these two complex roles would have seemed less symbiotic and therefore less sincere. For example, apparently Movie Guy Tom Cruise was initially supposed to have Wade's role; if that had come to fruition, we would have been distracted by Movie Star Tom Cruise, and the movie would have suffered terribly as a result.But despite the wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe, the movie's shortcoming is that Ben Wade's intentions seem rather inscrutable. I don't mean that they're simply ambiguous (is he going to flee or help the good guys fight off Navajo Indians?), I mean that they don't make much sense. One minute, Wade is all set to get away from Evans and escape to the safety of his gang, but in the next he's actually fending off his gang as it attacks Evans. There's no explanation given for this change of heart, but the new attitude is gone as quickly as it arrives, leaving the viewer a little puzzled. Sure, some may explain this as 'Wade comes to respect Evans and so doesn't want to see the rancher killed,' but Wade's actions were much more than that. He wasn't just trying to save Evans, you see, he was actively trying to knock off members of his own gang, and the reason for that escaped me completely.Still, 3:10 to Yuma is firmly entertaining, benefiting from two gritty, believable performances by Crowe and Bale, although it's marred by some unexplained actions on the part of its charismatic villain.",7,51,92,8 September 2007
The Expendables 2," Blood and guts and veins in my teeth
","You don't feel the testosterone in The Expendables 2 as much as immerse yourself in it, whether you like it or not. It manages to be awesome on several levels – a frantic action movie, a self-deprecating comedy, and okay, that's about it. But still! Explosions that make sense! The mocking of catch phrases! Great casting that doesn't feel forced! Stallone not in the director's chair! Yes, there's so much to like about the movie that we can overlook a lot of clichés and hammy performances. Let's look at the plot. Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team, having bilked Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) out of $5 million in the first movie, now have to make amends. No, Church doesn't have them tossed into Gitmo, and he doesn't kill them. Instead, he gives them a mission, the accomplishment of which would make them all even-Steven.The mission involves an infiltration into the jungles of Albania to rescue a secret something (a MacGuffin) from a downed airplane. Things don't go as expected. Ross and his team lose not only the MacGuffin but also one of their own. Tearfully, they vow revenge.Ross's team consists of Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth). Church inexplicably adds another member to their team – a soldier/intel expert named Maggie (Nan Yu). She may have been the second MacGuffin.The team tracks the bad guys to a series of secret mines in old Russia, where apparently a metric buttload of uranium exists for the taking. The bad guys, led by the well-named Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), plan to grab all of the unguarded uranium and, presumably, either hold the world hostage or just blow it up. We're not told, because it hardly matters.Now, this may not be the best of films. You won't find a truly intricate plot, even by Mission:Impossible standards. It is what it purports to be: men blowing stuff up with lots of weapons. At least this time there's a woman involved, but you can guess one of the reasons she's there. In any event, the stunts are exhilarating to watch and the action is intense, but what makes the film is the deft, complementary comedy. Church versus Ross. Ross versus Trench (Arnold Schwarzeneggar, yes). Trench versus Church. The movie is, in its entirety, a nod to the mindless action movies of the 80s in which many of these fellas appeared. Catchphrases from those old movies are mocked. Everyone looks bad ass, so much so that you forget that guys like Stallone and Schwarzeneggar are in their sixties.It was exciting to see the oldtimers in the first film, and this one adds some new (old) blood. Hemsworth, although not as ripped as his brother Chris, is terrific. Oh, and did I mention that a certain Chuck Norris is in this? I am not making this up. He's in it. I love how he's referred to as a lone wolf, a nod to his movie Lone Wolf McQuade, or that his character is named Booker, a nod to his movie Good Guys Wear Black. I wish he'd been able to do some martial arts, but the man's 70 years old, so I guess we can cut him some slack.This is a manly man movie. There's a lot of blood, many guns, lots of scars in the making. There is no romance, barely some flirting. You wouldn't expect that, anyway. The Expendables 2 delivers what it promises – it's a whipped-up frenzied concoction of old-school action movies with a generous sprinkling of creativity (in script and in cinematography).So that's why I liked the movie. Blood, guts, witty repartee, that about does it for me when I want not to think. You won't need to think here. Watch it – your brain will appreciate the rest.",8,23,42,25 August 2012
Skyfall," Satisfying; too many unanswered questions
","Skyfall, James Bond's 23rd screen adventure, caveats aside, is fun to watch both on a visceral level and on an intellectual level, but it leaves one with one too many unanswered questions or unexplained incidents to be counted among the best in the series. It's quickly paced, perhaps too quickly so, but the action scenes are memorable, as are the usual locales and women. Daniel Craig continues to solidify his hold on the iconic British spy.A hard drive containing the secret identities of all of MI6's secret agents has fallen into the wrong hands. You may ask why there would be one drive that contained all of that info, but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this movie. Bond's mission is to track down the drive and exterminate the thief, but the thief has much bigger plans in mind - and they involve, of all people, M (Judi Dench). M's past has everything to do with this plot, and its central theme is one of trust.Now, let me get one plot point out of the way, because it's occurred in several preceding Bond films - James dies. Or maybe he doesn't, who knows. The man has come back from the dead about a dozen times, it seems. It's what happens afterward that may make you scratch your head, an entire sequence of scenes that don't seem to make a lot of sense, based on what we've come to learn about Bond over the past 50 years. The way Bond deals with certain events just doesn't seem in character.Bond has some help. On an initial mission gone bad, he is accompanied by Eve (Naomie Harris), who can drive and shoot and is otherwise a capable agent. Then there's a new, young Q (Ben Whishaw), who is naturally a computer whiz - a necessity in a movie in which the ages of both M and Bond are contrasted with the rapidly changing outside world. They're relics, you see. The bad guy here is played by a blond-bewigged Javier Bardem. He has control of the list, and he's releasing the identities of all agents, five at a time, for no apparent reason. Okay, there's a reason, it's apparent, but it's mundane. When it's explained to you, you might have trouble buying it as a logical explanation. You see, here's one thing we know about our double-O agents: they sign up for their missions knowing they could die and that their lives are not more important than the mission and certainly not more important than the country itself. So if there's an issue of trust in this movie, it's that I had trouble trusting the movie to be on the up-and-up. It's one of those times when a movie makes a rule for itself and then breaks it just to further a plot.That's not to say that the movie is not entertaining, because it really is. The action scenes are, as typical, well shot; there's car chases, train chases, fights, and even a chase on the London Tube. There are locales as diverse as Macau, Shanghai, London, and Scotland (the country, not the Yard). There are few bon mots and plenty of gunplay. In some sequences, it's as if we're watching an old Western. The cinematography is definitely up to par.I believe that while Craig's Bond takes a step forward in development, Dench's M takes a step backward. There's a difference between being stubbornly British and being unrealistically foolish, so I found M to be a little less believable than I had in previous films. Dench does her best in a role that's much more physical here than it had been in the past, too. Bardem makes a terrible villain, and I mean that in the good way. He's diabolical, insane, and yet creepily believable.Overall, the movie is like many other Bond films - likable, not too dark, not too deep, filled with action and gorgeous women and settings. It is by no means a bad film, or even a mediocre film. It's a good film. I was just baffled by some of the plot developments, and I felt there was too much time spent on extra, dispensable characters. It was also no surprise to me that, when a particular actor showed up, he would be very, very much involved in not only the end of the movie but also movies to come, and that's a shame (the knowledge, not the fact).",6,2,8,11 November 2012
Iron Man 3," A few electron volts above 1 and 2
","Filled past the brim with a tighter script with fewer quips and even more action than the previous two installments, Shane Black's take on the metal-man's saga is gripping, fantastic entertainment with a capital E. Guns, robots, robot suits, self-healing people who can regrow limbs, you know, the usual stuff.The new villain to enter the world of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is The Mandarin, a mysterious, disheveled terrorist who's supposed to bear quite the resemblance to Osama bin Laden (although bin Laden himself is referenced in the movie). The Mandarin orchestrates several attacks on the US, but, tellingly, the explosions leave no trace of actual bomb. The Mandarin terms these attacks as lessons for the American people, and as they escalate in stature a nation turns its lonely eyes to Mr. Tony Stark, who's still trying to mentally process the events of The Avengers.You might remember that in The Avengers, Iron Man temporarily sacrificed himself to save Earth by traveling through a worm hole and fighting off alien bad guys alongside Captain America, The Hulk, and Thor. For a man who up until that point was essentially a playboy who settled the occasional revenge/grievance, Stark has a lot to go through. Now he suffers from horrific insomnia (72 hours awake!) and night terrors. His place in the universe has been forever altered, and so has he psychologically. So he ensconces himself within his laboratory/basement and works on Iron Man suits to his heart's content, forty-something, actually, each one with different capabilities, each designed to defend the Earth against, well, anything.But this has made for a brooding superhero. He can't sleep, so he does what he does best - build - to the eternal chagrin of his love, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who's now head of Stark Industries (well, High Up, anyway). Tony's behavior both frightens and confuses her, and now this business with The Mandarin - will Iron Man get sucked into another adventure?Here's how this movie differs from its predecessors. We no longer see only the invulnerable, cocky, risk-taking Stark. This new Tony is much more like Batman, looking for a way to escape from his demons and not even knowing what those demons are. He suffers panic attacks and seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This makes for a much more evolved, shall we say, superhero. It ain't just about him anymore, or about Pepper. It's about the life, the universe, and everything. And his mortality shows, like the slip of a woman who's dressed hurriedly, and he doesn't like it one bit.I saw this movie in 3D. It's worth it, doesn't seem forced. I didn't bother with the IMAX, because I don't really need to be that immersed in a comic-book movie, but your mileage may vary. As far as I was concerned, the 3D was more than enough. Stark makes copious use of his technology, but there comes a time in the film when he has basically nothing with which to work. I'm talking no suit, no JARVIS, no Pepper, no lab, no nothing. He has to rely on his intelligence and creativity and resourcefulness - the very same traits that got him out of that cave in the first Iron Man movie. It's not an altogether pain-free experience.Don Cheadle returns as Rhodes, whom the government puts in the War Machine suit from Iron Man 2, repainted in red, white, and yes blue, sort of a nod to ol' Captain America, called Iron Patriot. Nifty, and it reminded me of the early part of the Captain America movie, in which Cap essentially has to sell out and perform as a sideshow act for the troops, to keep up morale. With a Good Guy robot on their side, the government is pleased - until...well, this is truly not a spoiler, but a resident baddie finds a way to control Rhodes' suit, and we next have a subplot regarding the abduction of the president and the true identity of The Mandarin (guess what - Stark's past is involved).Now, those who are avid followers of the comic books may well be unhappy with some changes. Deal with it. The movie is not in a different dimension from its cinematic ancestors, and that's really the correct comparison. Some minor characters may have changed a little from the comics. Does it mean the movie suffers? Of course not.There was a lot more humility than I'd come to expect from these movies, more humanity, more fear of mortality. That injection of reality, following so close behind the tragedies within The Avengers, makes this a very good genre movie. Yes, there are surprises, and yes, there are moments when your heart skips a beat, and yes, there are truly beautiful moments. But in all, this is a high-energy, hyperactive film that still manages to be philosophical and even regretful.",7,1,2,12 May 2013
The Ring," Ring around the collar
","Watch it, and die. That's the basic premise behind this horror thriller, one of the few scary movies out there that carries a PG-13 rating. See, there's this videotape, and anyone who watches it gets a phone call as soon as they're done. A voice says, 'You have seven days.' And seven days later, you're deader than David Caruso's movie career. So what's behind these weird deaths? To find out, the mother of a teenager who apparently watched the tape (along with several other ill-fated friends) asks her sister Rachel (Naomi Watts), a newspaper reporter, to look into the matter. Rachel has a little boy named Aidan (David Dorman, looking a lot like a Culkin brother), who was close to the suddenly deceased teen. Rachel's travails take her to the stereotypical isolated cabin, where the group of teens stayed, and she discovers the tape. And watches it, of course, as I'm sure we all would. Does she also have seven days? Will she die of fright? And what of her cherubic, quiet son? And how about the neo-hippie, Bohemian ex-lover Noah, whose expertise in video production she needs? Rachel and Noah - who also watches the tape, against Rachel's wishes - find out more and more about the tape's origins and especially about the various specific images on the tape. You see, anyone who has taken a film class in college has seen student or arthouse film shorts that are steeped in abstract art. The images on the tape, very evocative and eerily mesmerizing, are all tied in together somehow - but how? What begins as an investigation of a seemingly harmless urban legend spawns a hysterical, desperate search for survival. It'd be one thing if Rachel had just been able to find out who was behind the tape - you know, a kind of 'I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that snooping reporter' thing - without actually watching the tape. But she HAS to watch it, and we have to watch along with her. There are some truly disturbing moments on the tape, and there were plenty of people shuddering in the movie theater. The main problem with the movie is that it never makes one think it's real. Sure, movies aren't documentaries, but a movie is much more enjoyable when the audience really feels as if they're in the movie, or at least feels as if the movie could be happening. But The Ring doesn't quite hook its audience; instead, it feels disconnected, as if - surprise! - you're watching a movie. This is not to say that the characters are not endearing or well-developed, because they are. Rachel is an excellent heroine - she's very smart, can think on her own, she's inventive, curious, creative, and adventurous. (She's also gorgeous, but that aspect isn't played up at all, refreshingly.) And Aidan is a wonderful multilayered character - like many things in the movie, Aidan is not always what we see. Is he a just a quiet, smart kid? Does he know about The Ring? Director Gore Verbinski does a great job in setting the mood; what Rachel feels, we do, although we still realize that what's happening is happening on screen only. There's excellent atmosphere, including a creepy scene with a little girl in an insane asylum; it's all very lurid. Watching Rachel piece the mystery together, while racing the clock, is fascinating - but again, it's like watching runners in a marathon on TV. You can see them sweat, and you can see them gasp, but you can't feel the pain they're going through, either physically or mentally.   The pacing of the movie is also above average - truly suspenseful moments are drawn out, and the real terror isn't seen, but imagined. As with The Sixth Sense, the act of building tension in a scene can really make or break a horror/suspense movie. Lesser films show you everything, and that's why they're lesser films.   So what's the bottom line? Is this a movie worth watching? Yes, it is. It's not the full-blown horror classic it wants to be, but it doesn't miss the mark by much. And the scenes on the infamous videotape have to be seen to be believed. It is a movie that'll haunt you for a few days or weeks? Probably not. It has a lot of evocative images, and it's well acted, but it lacks a heart.",7,2,4,29 October 2002
Spartacus," Sweeping epic of revoltin' slaves
","Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece - which is saying something, considering Kubrick's work, which includes '2001,' 'A Clockwork Orange,' and 'Barry Lyndon' - covers quite a bit of historical ground, but no director before or since has told the tale of the strong slave Spartacus inciting his fellow chained men and women to rebel against the arms of Italy. It's movies like these, along with De Mille's 'The Ten Commandments,' that really defined the term 'sweeping epic.' Kirk Douglas stars as the resilient leader Spartacus, and gives an unusually commanding and convincing performance. He's supported by an all-star cast, of course, including a magnificent Peter Ustinov, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work. The toughest part for Kubrick probably wasn't filming the movie, it was keeping all of his stars' egos in check - he had Charles Laughton, Ustinov, and Lawrence Olivier, to name three. Such heavyweights in a movie today would provide some amiable gossip column fodder, but it's a testament to Kubrick that there weren't more problems on the set. As for the movie itself, you won't find many movies with the same level of cinematography, which also garnered an Oscar. A must-see.",9,0,1,20 February 2000
Minority Report," Nearly flawless Cruise vehicle
","John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of Precrime, a futuristic law-enforcement program that allows authorities to stop murders - before they occur. In a nutshell, three beings called Precogs (short for 'Precognitive') are able to foresee all killings, usually a day (or less) before they occur. They can identify the killer and the victim, as well as the time of the murder (to the second); it's up to the Precrime team to figure out exactly where the murder will occur based on the Precog visions.It's a system that's never wrong. The Precogs only see crimes that WOULD have happened, not murders that might have happened. In other words, premeditative killings. (Why can't the Precogs see other crimes, such as rapes? Because of, as Anderton put it, 'the nature of murder'; that is, murder is an act unlike any other crime.)As a result of Precrime's efforts, murder in Washington, DC has diminished rapidly - down by 90%. People don't even think about committing murders anymore; the system is that much of a deterrant.Which makes it ripe for a setup, doesn't it?Enter Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell). He's with the Justice Department, on orders from the Attorney General, and he wants to examine Precrime a little more closely. He knows no mistakes are made, but he wants to know why. He's reluctantly given a tour of the facilities by Anderton, and he's even allowed to see the three Precogs.Shortly thereafter, the red ball that indicates the name of the guilty rolls a familiar name - Anderton himself. The next ball, showing the victim, reveals a name unknown to Anderton himself. He doesn't recognize the name, but he's supposed to kill the man in less than three days.  Needless to say, he runs; needless to say, his Precrim teammates follow.This much you would have gathered from the endless promos for the film. It looks, on the surface, like a standard Tom Cruise they're-out-to-get-me movie. In fact, when I saw previews of this movie, that's exactly what I thought. The man's been set up like a bowling pin in movie after movie.But hold on! It's a lot more complicated than that. Anderton's task is not only to find out the connection between him and the victim but also to find out who would want him to kill the man - and why. It's a trip that takes him through some of his own darkest memories (his son was kidnapped, never to be seen again, as a young boy at a public pool).Anderton is not your typical hero figure, either. He's hooked on the new drug of choice, which is consumed in the same way an asthmatic would breathe on an inhaler. He tortures himself nightly by viewing old discs (home movies) of his son and his wife, who left him after the boy's disappearance.Luckily, though, it's not a movie that leans heavily on making things up as it goes along, much like Cruise's last opus, Vanilla Sky. It's full of twists, torturous but not murky. Characters from John's past figure prominently into the plotline, but it's up to him to decide how much importance any one person has in resolving his inner and outer conflicts.The movie is also filled with wonderful special effects, the kind that enhance a film, rather than simply detract from its essence. It doesn't depend on these effects to pull it out of illogical missteps, either. Director Steven Spielberg, with this movie, rebounds nicely from the travesty of A.I. to produce what that alternate-reality movie failed miserably to provide: a real, believable plot powered by appealing, plausible characters. The story, based on a Philip K. Dick short story, keeps Anderton on his toes, and the audience along with him. The difference between this movie and many other pretenders is that Minority Report makes the audience care what happens to Anderton at each step of the movie. With many other films, the viewer sort of gives up on the character, either because they can't relate to him or her or because the pacing of the movie is so turgid as to prevent anything but ennui.And Cruise is perfect in the role. Absolutely perfect. When I saw the preview for this film, I thought the movie was trying to turn Tom into another Arnold-like sci-fi hero (Schwarzenegger's Total Recall was also based on a Dick story). I doubted seriously Cruise's ability to get down and dirty with a role, and pull it off. You may recall he was disfigured in Vanilla Sky; here he goes along a similar route, but his motivations and nuances are perfectly captured. The atmosphere created by the elite cinematography and the dazzling characterization from Cruise himself were the highlights of the movie.",9,0,0,24 June 2002
Finding Neverland," Perfect!
","Finding Neverland is the story of how struggling playwright J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) created Peter Pan, inspired by an equally struggling widow (Kate Winslet) and her four rambunctious boys. Exquisitely detailed, with sumptuous and elaborate set pieces, Marc Forster's filming of the Allan Knee play is artful without being arty.Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Barrie, although there's the usual caveat that Johnny Depp is perfectly cast in almost anything. He might well be the best actor working today, especially since he refuses to let himself become typecast. Hard to believe now that he used to be on that old Fox TV show, isn't it? Depp is dead-on earnest as the wise, soulful Barrie, who becomes a sort-of surrogate father to the four Davies boys, whose father has since passed away (although in real life he hadn't yet died when Barrie met the family).Although the movie is about the creation of Peter Pan, at its heart are smaller dovetailing storythreads about relationships, particularly those between Barrie and his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell), Barrie and Sylvia Davies (Winslet), and Barrie and the youngest Davies boy, Peter (Freddie Highmore). Depp's mastery of expression and pathos are on display here, as he turns in an utterly commanding, pitch-perfect performance; his Oscar nomination for this role was well deserved indeed.Depp is supported by an excellent cast that looks like it's been performing the roles for years. In particular, Winslet and Mitchell were magnificent, as was the venerable Julie Christie, who plays Sylvia's mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier. Dustin Hoffman turns in decent work as Charles Frohman, the proprietor of the playhouse in which Barrie's plays were performed (in other words, his patron). As Depp is now, Hoffman was long known for being able to disappear into a role - his roles in the 1970s alone are mighty eclectic indeed.This is a sheer beauty to behold, a movie that should certainly stand the test of time to be regarded in a few decades as a true classic. Your jaw will drop at some of the set pieces on display - check out the pirate ship! - and you'll marvel at the jaunty forays into the imagination of the playwright who never grew up. Finding Neverland will have even the most jaded and heartless melting and shimmering with pure, unadulterated joy.",9,2,2,12 May 2005
Training Day," Commanding Denzel
","Denzel Washington won the Oscar for this role as a corrupt narcotics cop. That in itself is an unusual sentence - not the Oscar part, but the 'corrupt' part, as Washington rarely plays bad guys. But his Alonzo is most certainly a bad guy, out on the streets not for the greater good but to further his own interests. Even so, while Alonzo's not the most moral of characters, Washington makes him so multilayered that you almost root for him to persevere. Ethan Hawke plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt. Ok, he's not a rookie cop, exactly; he's been on the force for something like 14 months. But he wants to do bigger and better things, so he's signed up for Alonzo's elite narc squad.
Alonzo puts Hoyt through the paces - visiting snitches, shaking down people, doing the drugs they confiscate (or at least making Hoyt do them). Through it all, Alonzo seems mean and cynical, but also worldly and supremely intelligent. He's not just some megalomaniacal renegade cop who's king of his own world, or even some Johnny Law with a 'tude. The viewer wonders what's up Alonzo's sleeve: Does he have plans for young Mr. Hoyt? Is he just playing with him? Or is he just completely nuts? You just plain never can tell with Washington's portrayal, and that's why he deserved the Oscar. Always keeping the audience guessing, Washington makes sure you don't pigeonhole his character as purely evil. The events that take place during the day (as the title suggests, all of the action is confined to one day's work) imply that they're all leading up to something - the audience just doesn't know what. If Alonzo is bad and is looking out for himself, what kind of denouement can be expected? If he isn't completely bad, is he going to say the day's just been one long lesson for his newcomer? The crisp script by David Ayer never lets up, relentlessly pounding the viewer with these and other questions. Moral ambiguity is a delicious plot device, but only if the script is well written. There's hardly any lag in Training Day, so that if there were any plotholes the viewer would gloss over them quickly enough. The movie's hard hitting, full of life and excitement, complete with plenty of twists. You can never get completely used to anything in the movie, because few things are as they seem.The one exception to this is Hoyt himself. Maybe he's supposed to be an Everyman; more likely he's just a wide-eyed innocent being corrupted by the Big Bad Veteran. Hawke has the wide-eyed look down pretty good, which is a bit of a comedown from a guy who played a supercool dude in 1994's Reality Bites. It's the meatiest role Hawke's had, and he seriously flubs it. But since he's playing opposite Washington, and since this is Washington's movie, Hawke's inadequacies are easily overlooked, as well they should be. Having said that, there's no way Hawke should have been nominated for an Oscar, as he was. What were people thinking? That Washington was as good as he was because he had Hawke to play off? Hardly. It's an ineffectual performance; Edward Norton would have been a far better choice - and he could have walked home with that Oscar, too.",8,1,11,2 April 2002
In Bruges," Sadly, no midgets are tossed
","Two hit men hide out in an unassuming Belgian town in this thriller, which starts out as a quiet two-character study and then jukes and jives its way to a screamingly violent conclusion. In Bruges is a low-rent Pulp Fiction knockoff, but it's a knockoff that pays off in spades, with strong, believable acting, excellent cinematography, and a taut, amusing script.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have just completed a rather difficult job and have been ordered by their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to repair to the idyllic town of Bruges to lay low for up to two weeks. 'Two weeks with you?' Ray exclaims to Ken. 'No way!' Ray's a novice to the world of hit-manning, and being as young as he is he's not too keen to spend two weeks in any spot that's not teeming with hot women or other fun things to do. Bruges isn't exactly a Mecca of excitement, you see. On the other hand, the more seasoned Ken is pretty happy with staying in the placid little burg, because it'll give him time to sightsee and take it easy.Both men start to believe there's something else afoot. Why Bruges, after all? They're Londoners, so why not hide out in London, or even in the English countryside? No, they had to schlep over to Belgium. (There are plenty of Belgian jokes, and a smart dig at Americans that was both accurate and snicker-worthy.) But before Ray can get properly bored, he meets a sweet young lady named Chloe (Clemence Poesy, late of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) working on a movie that's being filmed right there in Bruges, and he sees a chance to redeem himself for past sins - but apparently Chloe has a few dark secrets of her own.Gleeson and Farrell are wonderful together, and the film avoids such clichés as the young impetuous hothead and the veteran killer on one last job, and you never get the impression that they're just a couple of lunkheads who go around killing people randomly. (You know the type: Guy gets tired awaiting further instructions, so he shoots someone to keep in practice.) And of course, nothing goes as Ray and Ken expect it to go. There's no way, of course, that they're going to stay the entire two weeks in the podunk town with nothing happening, right? Yeah, probably not.So they wait around for Harry to call and give them further instructions, and when he does all hell really breaks loose. But setting that aside for the moment, here are some other entertaining aspects of the movie: drug use, gunplay, midgets, and blood. Yes, midgets! Okay, dwarfs. And although there's no dwarf tossing, there is a karate chop to a dwarf's neck, which is awesome in and of itself.Another plus is the film is remarkably well shot. Filming on location in the actual town of Brugge in Belgium, cinematographer Eigil Bryld brilliantly juxtaposes the angularity of the buildings and the beauty of the landscapes with the brutality of the men's violent behavior and coarse language. The pooling of blood on stark, gritty pavement, surrounded by gleaming snowdrifts and the pulchritude and quiet desperation of Bruges itself.Although not as wittily intelligent as Pulp Fiction, In Bruges is still quite clever - and not too clever for its own good, either. It's not one of those movies that tosses in funny dialog just to be funny or so-called twists just to keep the viewer guessing. Two charming, gutsy performances by Gleeson as the unorthodox older man and Farrell as the twitchy younger one boost this one up a notch about the typical caper thriller.",7,3,7,9 March 2008
John Wick," HOT LEAD and cute dog
","If there's a modern movie that better exemplifies the 80s action movie, I don't think I've come across it. The plot doesn't really have twists, and there are basically no subplots to speak of; it's just a straight line from beginning to finish. Reeves plays the titular retired hitman who's just lost his wife (to cancer) but who receives a beagle as a final present from her, delivered after her death. He has the dog for like two days before Russian mobsters invade his house to steal his vintage Mustang and kill the dog just for kicks. And thus the most plausible revenge plot in history is set into motion. There's a LOT of violence. A lot of characters die. Some of the action is very reminiscent of The Matrix. The weaponry is impressive, as is the hand-to-hand combat. There's a lot to love about John Wick the movie, as long as you're part of the intended audience, i.e., the action-movie fan.",7,0,1,26 April 2019
Kung Fu Panda," Audacious martial arts comedy
","Jack Black, playing completely against type, is an animated panda named Po who's been mistaken for the mystical, world-saving Dragon Warrior. Po's lack of ability - not to mention a recognizable waistline - runs counter to all that Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) teaches, and it doesn't ingratiate him with his idols, the Furious Five, either. This fast-paced comedy adventure is heavier on actual culture than pop-culture references, which is forever to its credit, and the game work by Black and Hoffman aid the rather generic storyline (fat boy must overcome odds to beat skilled ninja) immeasurably.There really is plenty to like about this movie. Let's start with the casting. Jack Black is a formidable, engaging comic personality to begin with, and he infuses Po with such exuberant naiveté and vulnerability that he's just like one of us, if we too were slovenly, belching pandas. Hoffman is also spot on as the wizened and wise Master Shifu, a red panda (although with far less red fur than you'd think), stereotypically tough on his charges but with a heart of gold. Somewhere in there, anyway. Maybe it's just a heart of emerald, or something.Aside from those two marquee names, Ian McShane (of Deadwood) is the nefarious Tai Lung, a former pupil of Shifu who has just broken out of prison, stronger than ever and with revenge on his mind. Considering he's voicing a creature in a PG-rated animated film, McShane's Tai Lung is full of menace and hatred, a vile enemy who's apt to scare the youngest audience members. But I'm sure the adults can handle his intensity, if they look away every now and again.Po has idolized the Furious Five all his life and desperately wants to see who will be selected by Master Oogway, Shifu's master, as the Dragon Warrior. Through an awesomely funny yet contrived circumstances, Po is chosen. 'There are no accidents,' intones Oogway mystically. Being chosen as the Dragon Warrior doesn't gain Po any favors with Shifu's current students, the famed Furious Five - Crane (David Cross), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Monkey (Jackie Chan), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie), who thought that one of them would be The Chosen One (tm). And so Po must prove himself to the other students and to his master, who just wants him to go away.One debit is that the supporting cast seems to be there for their names. Liu, Chan, Rogen, and Cross, four excellent talents, barely get any lines at all, and although Jolie gets a little more, uh, voice time, she doesn't really bring anything extra to the table. Stunt casting, is how I feel about it. Stunt casting.Even so, I laughed my ass off, despite the wholesome moral of even the littlest person making a difference or something. The point is that Black made me believe in Po. When he's jumping up the side of a cliff to get a sacred scroll, so was I. When Po is eating Master Shifu out of house and home, so was I. And when Po believed in himself, so did I. This movie was full of moments that make me remember exactly why I watch movies in the first place: to laugh and to believe.",8,0,1,8 March 2009
A Star Is Born," How did she not win an Oscar?
","There were times during this movie that I felt it was just one of the best I'd seen in a while...and then Bradley Cooper would appear in a scene, or open his mouth, or do anything. This brought the movie's quality down a little for me. He tries very hard to look and sound like a combination of Sam Elliott (he even modeled his character's voice after Elliott's) and Jeff Bridges' character from Crazy Heart, but he doesn't have the gravitas to pull it off. And although it was exhilarating to see Lady Gaga's Ally transform from unsure songstress to confident siren, Cooper's Jackson never really had the same kind of journey. The movie is supposedly about the crossing of paths, with one on the rise and one on the decline, but here Jackson is in decline and a bad egg from pretty much the get-go, and he never really wavers from that. He's the same throughout. I haven't seen the other versions, so perhaps this is how it should go, but it just felt to me that Cooper couldn't bring the right amount of pathos for his character. His chemistry with Gaga was terrific, but I think a lot of that had to do with her passion for the role. Cooper just felt kind of there.",7,1,5,11 March 2019
Gravity," One of the year's top films
","Gravity, Alfonso Cuaron's explosive, white-knuckle sci-fi instant classic is a wonder to behold, with devastatingly realistic effects as a backdrop to a terrifying, compelling story and terrific work by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. It is both a concrete what-if story and a mesmerizing existential mindbender.The U.S Space Shuttle Explorer is docked at the International Space Station. Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), on her first space mission, is installing an external device on the station that will enable astronomers to peer even deeper into space. Meanwhile, the mission commander Kowalski (Clooney), on his final mission, merrily spacewalks in a jet pack; other crew members perform maintenance or communicate with Earth.Then trouble strikes. Houston reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites, hurling debris throughout Earth's orbit. Before the crew can return to the shuttle and head back to Earth, the craft and the ISS are pounded with lots and lots of pieces of metal traveling at extreme speeds. The damage is extensive, setting off an odyssey for Dr. Stone that is both literal and figurative, as she must find a way to keep going and return back home.There is hardly a moment of inaction. Stone and Kowalski veer from problem to problem, everything accentuate by the simple fact that they are alone up there, not even able to contact NASA. It's a terrifying situation. Most of us might have a slight panic attack if we're stranded on the side of the road without a cell phone. Imagine being up in the heavens with no way to get down.Emmanuel Lubezki's dizzying camera-work serves two purposes: it provides us with Stone's visual perspective, that of a novice, and it provides context for the disaster she and Kowalski find themselves in. If you think that the pictures from the Hubble telescope were beautiful, wait until you see these breathtaking visuals; they're as stirring and evocative as the acting and story itself.Stone journey, as I mentioned, becomes more than just a path back to safety. She is grieving in her own way, becoming a quiet, almost listless passenger in life. Her decisions and her proactive attitude not only bring her closer to survival but also to a healing of her mind. This is definitely among Bullock's finest work, perhaps her greatest achievement to date.I've noted before that 3D movies in darkened environments, such as outer space, are utterly needless, since 3D actually removes light from scenes. But somehow, the 3D effects in Gravity sidestep that downside. The technology is used so expertly here that whether we are approaching an object at high velocity or it is approaching us, we feel immersed in the scene, not distracted from it. Tough to do.I simply cannot delve into the plot any more than I already have. The astute viewer will still have trouble guessing the outcome and the twists within the movie, particularly because the action is so hard- driven – while still utterly coherent and plausible.There are plenty of heart-stopping moments in Gravity, even for the most jaded of viewers. It is fantastic storytelling supported by arresting cinematography. It may be too early for movies to get serious award- season consideration, but I'll come out and say this right now: Gravity is one of the very best movies of the year.",9,161,315,30 September 2013
Wind River," Dare I say... disappointing?
","This was a decent movie. Not a ton of mystery, but the vistas are gorgeous and the acting is good. I'm not sure I really buy Jeremy Renner as a grizzled outdoorsman; he has this baby face that just seems out of place calling grown men 'son.' And I don't think that Elizabeth Olsen's character - the lead - is well written at all. Too often her character is portrayed as being naive or otherwise lacking. But it's still a good mystery and fairly well plotted, but you're better off watching Insomnia.",7,1,1,6 February 2019
I'm Not There," Maybe you had to be there.
","To appreciate I’m Not There., you need to fully buy into its somewhat-implausible premise; in it, six actors represent various aspects of Bob Dylan throughout his many decades in the limelight. If you buy into this premise, then this is a unique, thoughtful perspective of an almost-unknowable individual, a man who famously played things close to the vest, a man who shunned introspection. But if you don’t immediately buy into this premise, then the movie just feels like a long experiment that isn’t entirely successful, and in the end you don’t feel you know much more about the man, the myth, the legend than you knew going in. Which might be the point, who’s to say? And that’s sort of where I land on the whole I’m Not There. issue.Here’s one big problem right off the bat. The six various characters, each representing part of Dylan, have different names. Some of them are named after real-life people, like Woody Guthrie and Arthur Rimbaud. Some have fictitious names, like Jude Quinn (an amalgam of Jude from “Hey Jude” and Dylan’s own “The Mighty Quinn”), Jack Rollins, and Robbie Clark - the latter being an actor playing one of the aspects in a movie. And then it gets confusing.The first gimmick for this movie is that each aspect is played by an actor you wouldn’t expect to see playing Dylan. Okay, maybe not all of them, but some of them. Cate Blanchett is one. She’s female, in case you were unsure, and she is by far the best Dylan in the movie. She plays Jude, the latter-day, peeved-at-everyone Dylan. Another is Marcus Carl Franklin, who plays “Woody Guthrie” - here, a young version of Dylan, riding the rails across the Midwest. Franklin is African American. Then there’s Heath Ledger and Christian Bale, who are Australian (as is Blanchett) and Welsh, respectively. The problem with those, though, is that the only difference between them and the real Dylan is Dylan’s particular linguistic tendencies, so you wind up with just some guys acting Dylanesque. You know, the perpetual cigarette dangling precariously, the hat, the whole nine yards.It would have been more effective, for me, if each of the aspects was played by completely different looking people - because in order for them to be identifiable as Dylan, they would have to sound like him. Otherwise you’re left with some folk-singing iconoclast who’s rebelling against everyone, and you don’t know why. So there’s one issue. And that would have been a clever, but not too-clever, way for each supposed aspect or time period to be represented. Even if two aspects were on the screen simultaneously, big deal - at least we could tell who was who.But added to this gimmick is the fact that some non-Dylan characters - and some situations - are based on real-life people, like Allen Ginsburg, and retain their counterparts’ names, and others are clearly supposed to be real people but have … different names. And some situations definitely did occur (such as Dylan’s getting booed at the Newport festival, a huge turning point for him), but did all of them? Were any of them made up to highlight that particular aspect of his personality? One of the characters is Arthur Rimbaud. No, not the poet, he just has that name. Anyway, the entirety of his screen time is spent giving testimony or something to officials (or a jury, I’m not sure). And his speeches are of the deep philosophical sort, the kind that Dylan was apparently fond of - ways to get into people’s minds, but I’m not sure what the soliloquies add in terms of exposition and revelation.Then there’s also Richard Gere, who plays Billy the Kid, another “aspect” of Dylan. Apparently here Billy is mythologized as this hiding loner at the end of his career, just sort of like Dylan, only Dylan’s not even now at the end of his career, unless he keels over tomorrow, or something. Gere’s good, and I don’t say that often, but I think the aspect, such as it is, is too abstract and unreadable to be worthwhile.The intermittent narrator (Kris Kristofferson) is marginally helpful; perhaps he could have been used to tie all these aspects together. Instead we get two hours of ego feeding and idol worship. To me, though, it felt more like idle worship than anything else, a waste of time even if you’re willing to grasp whatever deep insights the film pretends to offer to you.",6,8,10,31 May 2008
Star Trek," Movie meets needs of many, few
","In this captivating origins story about James Kirk and the Enterprise crew, J.J. Abrams expertly dodges the issue of overfamiliarity and delivers a tight, action-packed, eminently thrilling tale.I expected a lot out of this movie, and to tell the truth I found the trailers and previews pretty mediocre. Nothing about them made me really want to see the film; it was as if the trailers were trying to manage the expectations of the intended audience. But here's the rub: Chris Pine, who plays Kirk, is a lot better than I thought he'd be - not a caricature of William Shatner, just a precursor to him, much like Ewan McGregor in Star Wars Episode 1, but with more subtlety.Kirk is introduced to us at his actual birth, moments after his father - very temporarily a Starfleet captain - sacrifices himself so that his entire crew, including his wife and newborn, may survive. Later events in the whiz kid's life inform his later character, the charm, intelligence, and dare taking that we all expect from James Tiberius Kirk.Kirk meets Spock, played by Zachary Quinto, at the Academy, where the latter designs the simulation that all prospective cadets must engage. The two lock horns when Kirk manages to defeat the simulation by rather unorthodox means, and that would typically be it for our young hero, but a sudden threat has been detected at the planet Vulcan, and all of the cadets, even Kirk, are quickly dispatched.Throughout the movie, the two main characters - we're talking Spock and Kirk here - must somehow evolve as, well, people, much as they did throughout the original series' run. Kirk, at the outset, is very emotional, despite supreme intelligence. Spock shows no emotional at all, suppressing his Earth half almost completely. Each, however, is completely certain that his own method is the only way to go, and their eventual compromise, brought upon by tragic circumstances, allows the Enterprise story as we know it to fully coalesce.Ah, you ask, if this is a reboot - hence the lack of numerals after the title - does that mean that the TV series and the movies should all be forgotten? Not so fast, my friend, not so fast! A useful little sci-fi writers' crutch known as time travel will solve everything. I'm being a little facetious, of course; this marks the third time in the eleven Star Trek films that time travel has been used, but it's not overused yet, and here it not only is a fun writers' tool but a genuinely creative way to show the past (the old films) while allowing future films to coexist.To sum up: In the future, old Spock tries to prevent a supernova from destroying Romulus, but he fails; a renegade Romulan general (played here by Eric Bana) blames Spock, and both he and Spock wind up going through a black hole that takes them a century into the past. Now the Romulan is trying to destroy young Spock before he can get old and not save Romulus.Abrahms' pacing is stellar, pardon the pun. There's hardly any letup with the action, and when it does we get poignant, well-acted scenes of reserved anger (Spock) or pensive musings (Kirk). There's only one love scene, and it's a quickie (again pardon the pun - not intended).The supporting cast was well picked, too. John Cho (Sulu), Anton Yelchin (Chekov), Karl Urban (Bones), Eric Bana (the Romulan, Nero), Ben Cross (Spock's dad), and even Winona Ryder as Spock's mother are perfect fits, eschewing scenery chewing for thoughtful, imaginative performances.A couple of other actors deserve special mention. Zoe Saldana plays Uhura, the beautiful communications officer on the Enterprise. Uhura has wildly different relationships with Spock and Kirk, and Saldana is well up to the task: a strong, intelligent, and relentlessly caring young woman (although, interestingly enough, not the only woman on the Enterprise's bridge). Then there's the cherubic Simon Pegg as Engineer Scotty; Scotty, unlike most of the other main characters, finds himself on the ship almost by accident, but his beaming ability saves the crew's bacon. Pegg's upbeat exuberance is catchy.This isn't just another pretty-people-in-space action movie. For once, although everyone is quite young (too young?) and attractive, there's quite a bit of substance behind each character. And remember, the movie could have the scourge of familiarity working against it as well; there's always the risk that it won't meet our high expectations of how the characters should behave. Not the case here. Star Trek is gleeful fun, managing to embrace the old while opening the door to adventures anew.",8,1,10,10 May 2009
Fight Club," Soap Floats
","Ah, those six-pack abs! For those of you who have been begging to see Brad Pitt at his toughest and grungiest, here's your movie! The film centers on a semi-secret group whose members pummel each other senseless (and senselessly) nightly in seedy basements. The club's leader, Tyler Durden, is a charismatic, Zen-conscious, manipulative misanthrope - and those are just some of his finer points. The film's protagonist, played by the talented Edward Norton, is a hopeless office-boy schlep stuck in a depressing, dead-end job, existing joylessly in a vanilla life that is supposed to signify the everyday lives of us regular folk. The stark contrast in the two main characters is no accident, and we quickly come to realize that the narrator lives through Tyler vicariously, even as they both create Fight Club. What better way to learn about yourself and your fellow man than by engaging in a bare-knuckled bout of fisticuffs? Didn't these people ever hear of more conventional, less-painful methods such as primal scream or aspirin? So what's the theme of this movie? Well, behind all the blood and guts, it's about finding oneself. It's about deciding whether to live your life as an ant performing the tasks of other ants or to live your life in ways that only your imagination can show you. I think it's also something about becoming a better person through violence, a theme we saw in A Clockwork Orange, way back when.This is more than a mere fight movie, as its presumptuous theme indicates. Amazingly, with as much attention paid to the violence, there's actually room for a taut, creative script that's absolutely full of little nuggets of intelligence. This is a movie that beats you over the head with one theme (violence is good when used for self-improvement) while simultaneously sneaking in another, more clever theme. It's also got a fantastic twist right near the end, and if you see it coming - please shut up! The twist is reminiscent of another, even more popular movie (if I tell you which movie, then you'll more easily guess the secret), and if you're not looking for it - that is, if you're one of those who lets things happen in a movie, who doesn't try to guess each scene before it happens - you'll be shocked right out of your recliner. I finished watching this movie about half an hour ago, and I still feel a little uneasy - it can make that kind of impact on you.",8,0,1,26 April 2000
The Maze Runner," Love the premise and execution
","The Maze Runner is an exceptionally entertaining little movie that belies its origins as a young-adult story. It's one of those increasingly rare movies that make excellent use of such quaint amenities as setting and atmosphere to instill a real sense of panic, courage, determination, and fear in even the most disaffected teenager. It's tightly paced, with few logical inconsistencies to nitpick, too.It all begins when Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find himself in a rapidly ascending elevator stocked with what appear to be provisions of some kind. When the elevator stops and the top is opened, he discovers that he's the latest arrival in an all-boys community that's at the center of a giant, ever-changing, complex stone maze. The boys, some of whom have been there for a long time, have established a pacifistic community that relies on those monthly provisions and their own hard work (building shelters, low-level farming) to survive.But that maze. It's enormous and inscrutable. There are specialists, called Runners, who enter the maze each morning in order to map it and to try to find a way out. But if they don't return by dusk, the maze's stone doors will close, leaving the hapless teens inside for the night. And no one has ever spent a night in the maze and survived.This is the ominous, bleak scenario with which young Thomas is presented. Alby (Aml Ameen), the leader of the crew, explains that there are only three rules in The Glade, that happy little faux-Paradise in which they all live: do your part, don't hurt another Glade resident, and don't feed them after midnight. Wait, sorry, that last one is from Gremlins. I meant that Gladers (uh huh) are forbidden to go into the maze. Well, unless they happen to be Runners.So, once a month they get new supplies and a new young dude. But once Thomas arrives, things start to be a little different in the Glade. A runner is stung by a Griever (they're nasty robotic creatures who lurk in the maze) in broad daylight. Stings aren't good - they incapacitate the stung person and imbue them with violent tendencies. As such, he who has been stung is necessarily banished from The Glade, for the safety of the rest of the clan.Thomas isn't like everyone else, as the somewhat-hotheaded Gally (Will Poulter, Chronicles of Narnia: The Dawn Treader) is quick to point out. Gally notices that things seem a little off since Thomas's arrival, and he blames the greenie for disrupting what felt like a little slice of heaven. But on Thomas's side are Alby, Alby's second in command Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and the most-recent new blood, a young boy named Chuck (Blake Cooper), who looks a lot like Chunk from The Goonies.Something has changed with Thomas's arrival; it seems that whoever or whatever is behind the maze's creation is changing the rules. For one thing, an unscheduled arrival of the elevator yields a new member for the group: a girl. The first one, in fact. It's Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), who appears to know Thomas from before their time in The Glade. Both Thomas and Theresa have dreams regarding their 'before time' - again, unlike the others.Thomas is acutely aware that the existence of the group in The Glade is not necessarily permanent, as evidenced by the attacking Grievers and the various infighting of the Gladers. Thomas wishes to find out more, and Gally simply doesn't, content to keep things as they are. This is the crux of the movie's moral issue - is it better to keep what one has, even if one has little and under repressive conditions, or to strive to escape those conditions on the hope of finding a better life elsewhere? Leaving aside the morality of having teenagers battle robot-animal hybrids (goodness knows we've seen plenty of movies about kids killing enemies or each other lately), the eternal question of why the boys and Teresa are even in The Glade lingers over them all. It's just that Gally and his small band of followers don't want to know the answer, and Thomas and his desperately do.The action is fierce and creative. Even the battles with various Grievers are well shot (sometimes tough to do with robots, because with so much activity it can be difficult to discern what's what and who's who, particularly in a low-light setting), and the maze is something to behold - a real work of art, were it real. The acting is better than might be expected for a young-adult film, and O'Brien, Brodie-Sangster, and Poulter are each well cast.It's obvious that The Maze Runner is intended to be a franchise - if it enjoys box-office success, of course. If this turns out to be another Golden Compass, then this may be the only Maze Runner movie we see. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of dangling plot lines at the end. Even so, the movie is exciting and persuasive and doesn't try to dumb itself down for the sake of its audience.",8,6,11,20 September 2014
Memento," A field of forget-me-nots
","Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a memory problem: He cannot form new memories. He forgets things a few minutes after they've occurred. This is caused by emotional and physical trauma he suffered when he once woke up in the middle of the night and saw his wife murdered by asphyxiation. Now Leonard's determined to figure how who the killer is.   To combat his ailment, Leonard takes photos with an Instamatic camera and writes a sentence or two on the back of the picture. He snaps pictures of people whom he's not sure if he just met - and he's also never sure if they're friend or foe. Among the players are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), the latter of whom supposedly lost a loved one in a similar matter and who therefore feels a sort of kinship with the traumatized Leonard. The most fascinating aspect of this movie is that it's shot out of sequence. Because Leonard's memories are pretty much kaput (he can clearly remember everything up to the murder, but not subsequent memories), we actually get to see the same scenes a couple of times. No, it's not repetitive. Here's an example. Scene fades in, and Leonard is running through backyards, cutting, juking, zigging, and zagging. He suddenly says - for we can hear his thoughts - 'Ok, where am I? He spots another man running nearby. 'Oh,' Leonard thinks, 'I'm chasing him,' and he starts to move in the other man's direction. Oops - the man suddenly charges back at Leonard. 'No, wait... he's chasing me!' Leonard thinks. And in another scene, we see the events leading up to that particular chase, as well as events after it. It's up to the viewer to place them in the right order, but seeing the scenes out of sequence, I think, is very useful here. Things are clearer when they're revisited with more information. Now, when Leonard writes on the back of the photos, what he writes is influenced greatly by whatever has happened just prior to the photograph's creation. This complicates things greatly; if he thinks someone's a nice person, he'll snap the picture and write on the back that they're a nice person. But later, he'll look at the picture - without remembering anything - and take the words at face value. If it says he liked the person, then the person's good, even though he might not have known much about that person. There are infinite twists to this movie, and the ending is fantastic. You may know right off that this is no ordinary who-killed-my-wife caper, but you will have a tough time predicting the outcome.",9,0,1,3 October 2001
Inglourious Basterds," Disappointing: slow and skillless
","Tarantino's latest, a WWII revenge tale, is also his most disappointing, somehow managing to be like a bowl of plain oatmeal: tough to stomach, lumpy in spots, and ultimately flavorless.I confess to being a full-throated fan of Quentin Tarantino. (We both come from solid video-store-employee stock, you see.) I have enjoyed all of his films, including the ones he wrote but didn't direct. And I have to say that compared with his other works, Inglourious Basterds falls short of all of them.The (fictional) story is about a group of Jewish Americans recruited by one Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) to hunt Nazi soldiers and, well, scalp them. Raine's Basterds are very good at their jobs (Raine's required 100 literal scalps from his crew), and their notoriety has spread. The team is assigned by the Americans to rendezvous with a German actress/double agent named Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), who has discovered that the location of the premiere of Joseph Goebbels' latest propaganda film has been moved from the vast Ritz theater to a smaller venue in Nazi-occupied Paris.Unbeknownst to von Hammersmark and the Basterds, the young owner of the new venue, played by Melanie Laurent has her own plans for the premiere; she and her lover will set the theater on fire, killing all the high-ranking Nazis inside, including Goebbels and Hitler.There are also two other smaller stories (all four dovetail in the end, of course). An SS officer, Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz), known as 'the Jew Hunter,' has a Jewish family murdered on a remote farm in France, where they are being hid. Naturally, the one person who escapes his wrath that day grows into the young theater owner. Also, a German sharpshooter, now a national hero, is the subject of Goebbels' new film and is himself trying to woo the young theater owner.My first problem with the movie is the revenge factor itself. In order for me to root for a protagonist who's exacting revenge, I need to a) sympathize with their plight and b) believe that the punishment they're meting out is suitable. And although there's plenty of style to this film, I don't think that the Basterds met either of those criteria. In fact, it would be one thing if this were a straightforward (and straightfaced) revenge flick, like Death Wish, but Pitt and his fellow Basterds take far too much glee in torturing and dissecting Nazis than I'm comfortable with. Their mirth seems not only out of place, it seems kind of sick minded and unnecessary.My second problem is just as insidious: the casting of Brad Pitt. I am a fan of Brad Pitt's work, as I am of Tarantino's. I think he can turn in good work when he wants to - that is, when he's not playing the sly, smarmy character he sometimes lapses into in movies like the Ocean's films. And that's what he does here. He's not just a superspy who's in charge of an elite commando unit, he's just a thuggish jerk who's really no better than the villains he's mowing down. On top of that, Pitt uses a ridiculous southern drawl that sounds exactly like someone trying to sound like a southern backwoods hillbilly mountain man: made-up, well over the top, and really grating to the ears. Killing natsies, indeed. I just think that a better actor, in this case, would have lent more gravitas to the role; Pitt's Raine feels like everything in the movie's supposed to be a big joke.Overall, I was surprised to find few real twists or any memorable dialog (other than the laughable lines that Pitt overplays, seen in the trailers and previews anyway). Tarantino is known for slick, clever dialog, especially quick patter, and none of that was evident here. The twist - such as it is - is amply evident to everyone except the characters themselves.At 153 minutes, Inglourious Basterds is as long as most other Tarantino songs, but without crisp dialog and tightly staged action scenes, it drags on. In some scenes (a standoff in an underground bar is well shot), this works, but overall there's just far too much down time.",4,6,22,30 August 2009
Underworld," Dark, dark, dark!
","It's the oldest war of them all. No, not Democrats versus Republicans, or politicians versus the truth. It's vampires versus werewolves (or Lycans, if you prefer), Evil versus evil. Or good evil versus bad evil.Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a beautiful vampire warrior who comes across a human named Michael (Scott Speedman), who's been marked by the werewolves. Why Michael? Are the Lycans planning to use him in their endless battle with the vampires? Will Michael fall for the lovely, the talented Selene? Will Selene get to kick some werewolf butt? Yes, like sand through the hourglass of time in a bottle, these are the burning questions that are thankfully answered within the first twenty minutes or so.The film is very similar to The Crow in style (and in a nod to the earlier film, Speedman's character is named Michael Corvin; the lead character in The Crow: City of Angels was named Ashe Corven); it's dark, noirish dark, foreboding dark, bad-guy dark, you name it. See, there's dark, and then there's dark dark. This is the latter. Now, the original Crow movie was wildly stylish, and Underworld carries that torch a little bit further. Not only does style triumph over substance, it body slams it to death and then dances on its grave. In other words, don't look too closely at the plot, which doesn't always hold up to close scrutiny. But that's not likely, since the film's so dark (did I mention that).As with most comic-book-atmosphere tales, this one is full of Pretty People. Even vampires and werewolves gotta look good, you know, what with the extra grooming and tooth filing and all. At any rate, there's nary an Ugly Person in sight. Even the despicable ones are Pretty People.As Selene, Kate Beckinsale is very good, appropriately slinky and pliant. Beckinsale's not known for taking on tough roles such as this - you usually see her in upper-crust films such as Emma and Cold Comfort Farm. But she acquits herself very well, so much so that there's a sequel planned for 2005.Her primary foil is Shane Brolly as Kraven, the leader of the vampires. Brolly snarls a lot, showing off what have to be more than the usual 32 teeth in the process. Brolly didn't have much in the way of facial expressions here, just you're basic 'I'm mad!' and 'I'm madder!' looks.Underworld is agreeably well done, with a believable romance between Speedman and Beckinsale shunted to the background. This is about werewolves versus vampires, with men in the background, clueless as always, so the romance played out well on a subtle level.",6,0,1,1 May 2004
Captain Marvel," Stellar with one flaw
","It's about time. It's about time we got a female superhero in a superhero movie that's actually good. At least in the MCU. What's more, it's about time we got a movie in which the protagonist is adept at not only action-movie dialog but also the normal-movie stuff - you know, acting. Carol Danvers isn't meant to be the savior of the female box-office draws. She's not some stand in for feminism, she IS feminism. She is powerful before gaining any superhero powers. She's all the qualities you'd expect to see in any superhero, but the fact that she's female isn't played as an asset in and of itself - why, it's as if she were a fleshed-out character who just happens to be female. Maybe that's not really a hot take, but it's mine. And Brie Larson is the perfect choice to play her. If you thought her work in Room and Short Term 12 and others was a fluke, this should dispel those notions. Now, for the rest of the movie. The only real problem I have with it is that it's a little too easy to see the double crosses or triple crosses coming. It's too easy to see who the bad guy really is. That's not much of a debit, in the grand scheme of things. Take the first several scenes, in which Danvers, I mean Vers, is with a group of Kree led by Jude Law. I knew none of these characters, and yet I was entranced by their shenanigans. A lot of this is due to, again, Larson, who seemingly willed clarity to the weirdness, but it also has a lot to do with the writing. I thought the nods to the 1990s were fantastic and spot on, including the music choices. I thought the acting was universally solid, and I loved seeing Annette Bening. There was a LOT to like about this movie, and I'm glad I saw it in the theater.",7,5,18,11 March 2019
Coraline," Technically immaculate, daring 3D adventure
","Coraline Jones moves into an old, pink house with her neglectful, condescending parents and finds a door to another world - a world that seems insanely perfect, including the presence of loving, attentive parents with buttons for eyes. And then things get weird in director Henry Selick’s highly imaginative fantasy, filmed in dazzling 3D stop animation.There’s so much to like about this movie, but if you weren’t a fan of The Nightmare before Christmas (also directed by Selick), you may as well stop reading: this is not the movie for you.There are two other tenants in the apartment house: an elderly British couple, stars of the stage (played by Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French of Absolutely Fabulous) and a Russian acrobat who’s all limbs and belly (played by Ian McShane of Deadwood). All the tenants are oddballs who, one would think, would provide the bored Coraline with plenty of stimulation, but they’re a bit self absorbed - the actresses constantly competing with each other for any purpose, and the acrobat constantly working on his act with trained mice.When Coraline stumbles upon a locked crawlspace door, she’s immediately intrigued, but unlocking it reveals only a brick wall. But then that night she’s awakened by a mouse under her bed who leads her back to the door, which, when she opens it, now shows a tenuous pathway to another, far-off door. Being the curious little girl she is, Coraline goes through the door, emerging in an exact replica of her own kitchen. Except different. The mother in this room is cooking, for one thing, which her real mother never does. And when the mother turns to greet Coraline, there’s another, even greater difference: she wears two black buttons for eyes. Gasp! Seems that this new world Coraline’s discovered is perfect in every way, with wonderful, caring parents who dote on her every whimsy. Not only can her mom cook, she cooks everything Coraline wants. And her dad is a musician - the piano plays him! Oh, it’s madness, I tell you, sheer madness. Then there’s outside! In the real world, it’s a desolate yard, unencumbered by plant life (the irony here is that Coraline’s parents are gardening writers), but here there’s a magnificent display, a visual cacophony of light and flowers and birds and bees. It’s astoundingly rendered in stop-motion animation, and it’s even more wondrous in three dimensions.But things aren’t as they seem. The stark beauty of this other world and the kindness of the Other Mother are mere props in a greater play. The question posed is this: Will Coraline decide to stay in her new world, even if she must sacrifice to do so? Beyond the impressive cinematography (by Pete Kozachik, who was nominated for The Nightmare before Christmas), there’s also excellent voice work offered by Dakota Fanning as Coraline as well as Teri Hatcher (as Mother and Other Mother) and John Hodgeman (the IBM guy in those currently ubiquitous Apple ads). Fanning in particular was a good choice as the hurting, neglected Coraline.Coraline is brilliantly conceived and stupendously executed. It has all the mystery and show-stopping magnetism of The Nightmare before Christmas, and it has even more heart. Know why? Because more so than Nightmare, this is a tale about love and redemption; you root for Coraline not only because she’s a psychologically lost girl but also because her antagonist is so hissably awful. The villain here is really a symbol for the feeling all kids have at some point of not being wanted or appreciated; Coraline must slay that dragon to survive.",9,1,3,7 February 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Gory, but not scary.
","Pardon my impertinence, but aren't zombie movies supposed to be scary? Or are they supposed to be funny? After watching this remake of George A. Romero's 1978 thriller (itself a sequel to 1968's Night of the Living Dead), I'm all confused. To sum up, some kinda plague thingy breaks out, turning nearly everyone into jibbering idiots. After a while, it's hard to tell which ones are zombies and which ones have simply been watching too much election coverage. All heck breaks loose. Loved ones are killing each other. Little kids, too. Everyone's gone all higgledy-piggledy.A hardy bunch of survivors makes its way to the most American of inventions, the shopping mall. They have all they need - food, shelter, TVs, XBoxes, and a zillion zombies patrolling outside the mall, desperate to get in and feast on the nice, fresh meat.Lemme stop for a minute here and wonder out loud. (Note: This is a rhetorical question.) Why do zombies need fresh meat? Why can't they just feast on each other, or even themselves? Would they even notice if they bit their own hand off, for example? (Okay, that was three rhetoricals.)So our intrepid gang barricades itself inside the mall. But they soon want to get out. They're holding out hope that somewhere out there, there's someone who's not quite dead yet. You know, somewhere where the zombies haven't quite taken over. Like Canada, or something. But we the viewers know better, don't we? This is as good as it gets, staying in a mall all the time. If it were me, I don't know if I'd ever leave. But oh, those nutty survivors. They're communicating with the crazy cat a building or so over via sandwich board, playing chess long distance and the like. We see all kinds of fun and exciting activities, all set to a peppy song, whose name and beat I have conveniently forgotten for all eternity.So they want to get out. Their plan is to commandeer two of the mall's shuttle buses, fortify the crap out of them, and off they go. Well, bad things happen. The end.This movie failed for me because at no point was I scared. I didn't jump out of my seat, or even shudder. Sure, there's gore, but it's pretty mundane. If you've seen one head explode, you've seen 'em all. (Oddly enough, when someone shoots a zombie in the head late in the movie, Ving Rhames is inexplicably impressed.) Movies like this need to have a strong sense of reality; the viewer must be able to imagine that this is happening Right Now, outside his or her own door. And this movie utterly failed to do so for me, which made it take on a surreal and ultimately comic sheen.The acting's no prize, either. I know these guys had little interesting or unique to say, but I felt little sympathy for them regardless - and that's the actor's job. Convey to me how awful your situation is. I wasn't openly rooting for the zombies, but sometimes I felt like it.One final nitpick - the ending credits sequence contains footage of What Happens Next. It's very, very jarring; credits are shown on a red background, then there's a quick cut to video, then back to the credits, on and on and on. Distracting and pointless.",4,3,7,3 November 2004
Iron Man 2," Strong follow-up
","In this comic-book-movie sequel, industrialist Tony Stark battles a new electric-whip-wielding enemy, plus the US government, plus a rival weapons maker, and – of course – himself. Iron Man 2 met my expectations as a solid popcorn-movie followup, complete with believable characters, a plausible plot, and lots and lots of action.Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), revealed to the world as Iron Man in the first film is quickly subpoenaed by Congress, which wants his weapons. Stark, of course, is adamant that the feds not get their hands on, well, his own body. This leads to the introduction of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), who holds many government contracts and who is apparently insanely jealous of Tony Stark's success.Meanwhile, in a far-off land, a tattooed Mickey Rourke – playing a Russian physicist, no less – plots his revenge on Stark, something about his dad being done wrong by Stark's dad lo those many years ago. And this leads to Rourke becoming Whiplash, a man powered by a device similar to Stark's own chest implant, only with giant electric whips. Neat trick, huh? That the military eventually – okay, quickly – gets its hands on one of Stark's suits shouldn't come as much of a surprise. But in this movie, anyway, the army isn't the bad guy, so there's that. After all, Stark's best buddy is James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, played here by the excellent Don Cheadle, who's a lieutenant colonel. And you just know, having seen the first movie, that Rhodey will suit up himself here, as War Machine.Although the movie gets off to a slow start, focusing a bit too much on Stark the person rather than on Iron Man the action dude, it perks up when other characters enter the fray, particularly Scarlett Johansson as a notary in the employ of Stark Enterprises. (Note: She's not just a notary.) Downey Jr. is amiable as always as Tony Stark, and it's as great of a fit here as before. (Some would say this role represents typecasting for Downey Jr.) Stark is brave but vulnerable, smart but besotted. He's lost without Pepper Potts, his assistant and true love, and their relationship dips and crests throughout the movie as well.In fact, all returning actors reprise their roles rather well, and most of the new ones immerse themselves in the Iron Man universe seamlessly – including, I should note, Samuel L. Jackson, who barely appeared in the first Iron Man movie but is in several more scenes this time around, as Nick Fury. Yes, THE Nick Fury. Garry Shandling's also on board as an oleaginous senator.Only real quibble is with Rockwell as the slimy Hammer. At first, this looked like a role more suited to Greg Kinnear – smarmy white dude – which would be beneath Rockwell, who's a strong actor. But later on it looked more like Rockwell was too – pardon me – cute for the role as Hammer, who turns out to be much more ruthless than at first blush. Sam Rockwell doesn't look ruthless at all, and he isn't convincingly ruthless.Still, quite a bit of fun. There should be at least one more IM film, says director Jon Favreau (who has an on screen role as well, as #1 helperdude Happy Hogan).",8,0,1,9 June 2010
World War Z," Infectiously good, even if perhaps not a true zombie film
","Although it deviates from the source material more than a tad, World War Z is a certifiable, credible thriller that's part old-time adventure film and part new-school medical procedural. It's a fast-moving, intricate, and solidly acted by the indomitable Brad Pitt.Okay, sure, the 'Z' stands for zombies (in the book and in the film), but let's be frank (or Bob or Justine) - these aren't zombies, really. Well, they're sort of a cross between a zombie and the victims of the Rage virus from 28 Days Later. The bitten turn into homicidal maniacs about ten seconds after infection has set in. But they're attracted to noise and to life itself, so essentially if you both have a terminal disease and are really quiet, they won't see you. These infected are sort of like the T. Rex of the human populace.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN employee with some knowledge about infectious disease. He's driving his kids to school and his wife (Mirielle Enos) to work in Philadelphia when it happens - sudden stop of traffic followed by cars crashing, police scrambling, and finally, a horde of contaminated peoples running amok over the city, coming after those who still live. This sets off the expected chain of events of Gerry and his family ushered out of Newark, NJ to a ship in the North Atlantic, from where the UN is running its operation of Find the Cause. The UN, in the person of Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), pulls Gerry into the scrum: they feel he's their man; he's the one who can find out not only where the infection began but how to stop it.Gerry's adventures take him to such incongruous places as South Korea, Israel, and Wales at a frenetic pace. Some scenes are eerily reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing; in one, Gerry and a military escort must silently pedal bikes to a plane for refueling, so as not to alert the walking dead and thus turn them into running dead. It's a creepy, chilling scene, and never has riding a bike looked so difficult.Now, if you've read the book by Max Brooks and plan to see this movie, you should know that the overall structure of Brooks' book (narration by Lane) is jettisoned for a more straightforward action-movie approach. And you might well be put off by that at first, but once you get over your faux outrage, you may discover that the movie is actually the better for the change; the result is much more suspenseful and riveting on the big screen than a true adaptation might have been.I like Brad Pitt, and this makes up for Killing Them Softly in spades. He's his usual terrific self as Gerry, who isn't some hardscrabble, world-weary action guy but rather an authentic everyman who could be any of us, only with better hair. His Lane is shown to be quite vulnerable (physically and psychologically), and Pitt's able to pull it off magnificently - unlike, say, a Tom Cruise or a Leonardo DiCaprio (the latter made a heavy bid for the rights to Brooks' tome). This is part of what makes Pitt such a fine actor. He's malleable; he can play bad guy, good guy, action hero, clever bastard, and so on without looking out of his element. He is the driving force of this film.As I mentioned, the movie moves (shambles?) at a quick pace. Ordinarily, this might mean that there's little plot involved, but if anything the movie is overplotted. Thankfully, time isn't wasted trying to explain to us every little detail about how Lane arrives at certain conclusions or on secondary or tertiary characters and their reasons for being where they are. It's a succinct plot that makes the best use of its runtime.World War Z, although perhaps not a true zombie film (are the victims killed and then turn or are are they infected and then turn?), is a perfectly good adrenaline-rush movie with a punchy, intelligent script and a typical knockout performance by Pitt.",8,6,12,23 June 2013
Seven Years in Tibet," A vibrant tale of a caustic climber's change
","Heinrich Harrer is not a nice man. Driven, you might say, but overall not the most gregarious of individuals. His single-minded mission: scale a particularly difficult Alps peak in Austria. Of course, when he does so he abandons his girlfriend and their unborn child, but hey - you have to have goals in life, right? But this isn't a simple tale of a man finding himself on the mountain. You see, poor Heinrich's dream of scaling the peak isn't realized. World War II breaks out and he's taken off the mountain by Allied forces and imprisoned. He breaks out and attempts to visit Tibet, completely closed off to foreigners. Starving and cold, he eventually gains admittance, and through luck somehow becomes friends with the young Dalai Lama. It's the relationship between the two of them that changes Heinrich from a bitter, selfish, and self-absorbed young man into a diligent, thoughtful and courageous adult. At the Dalai Lama's bidding, Heinrich introduces movies to the Tibetans, and he teaches the young spiritual leader all he can about the Western world. Perhaps the most appealing thing about this true-to-life story is the casting of Brad Pitt as Heinrich. The man with the six-pack abs is not usually the first choice when it comes to the pensive roles, but Pitt pulls off the feat with style and a real sense of class. What's more, his character's transformation is gradual and perfectly plausible; it's not one of those one-minute-he's-a-jerk, the-next-minute-he's-a-saint transformations. This isn't easy for an actor to do, especially one with Pitt's maligned reputation. Mix in delightful cinematography with sumptuous scenes of Tibet itself, and you got yourself a fine movie. Don't think of it as overburdened drama, think of it as a spiritual odyssey. The true purpose and nature of this odyssey, however, remains unknown to our protagonist until he visits the ancient city of Tibet.",7,2,3,4 March 2000
The Hunger Games," Perfect performance by Lawrence, and an exciting movie to boot
","I was very impressed with The Hunger Games. Sure, you have to suspend a little bit of logic, and the great old tradition of a dystopian future is revived, but overall it's an excellent film with terrific camera-work and editing and a knockout performance by the soon-to-be-a-huge-star Jennifer Lawrence.So there was this big war, and the world was divided into 12 districts, and as a reminder of its vicious past the Capitol decreed that each district send two children, ages 12-18, to participate in a fight to the death. Somehow this is to remind them of not only their past but humility and the fact that they're likely to die young. But it seems like a post-apocalyptic society with a blend of technology and rustic charm, so who knows. Anyway, 24 kids, chosen randomly at ceremonies called Reapings, and it's all a Big Deal. They've been doing it for almost three-quarters of a century.District 12 is a hardscrabble, coal-mining community whose mine blew up. So people are pretty destitute. They (barely) live off the land. When the Reaping comes, Primrose Everdeen and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are chosen. Poor Prim's just a little girl, so her older sister Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers in her place. This has apparently never happened before, which seems implausible, but you can go with it.The two Tributes are then taken to the capitol city, where they are judged and evaluated in order to gain sponsors; sponsors can help you when you're in the middle of the forest. Preparing Katniss and Peeta for the Games is Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), who's actually won the games and can offer advice, and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) whose job it is to make the two Tributes look good when being presented in the parade and the talk show and so on and so on. And then the games begin.Imagine you're in the middle of a field within a semicircle containing 23 other young people. Some of them are athletic. Some are tiny and may never have left the house. Some have been preparing their entire lives. There is a cache of weaponry and food near the semicircle. Your mission is to survive longer than everyone else. You're under a lot of stress already, and now it really sinks in - you will certainly have to kill one or more of those you see, kids with whom you have no quarrel. Kill or be killed, as they say.The entire Games takes place in a huge climate-controlled dome. In fact, everything can be created/controlled, including fire and animals. As in the TV series Survivor, some of the kids form alliances, led by alpha males. Katniss isn't that kind of creature. She doesn't even want to be there. Who does? The ones who have been training all their lives, of course. The cinematography is riveting. It's sometimes tough to get a read on a situation when all you see are people running through the woods, close up. Not here. The director of photography, Tom Stern, does a miraculous job of keeping us in the story, involved with the main characters, without losing the edge of heart-racing action. I thought Lawrence was amazing in her gritty performance in Winter's Bone. This cements, in my mind, her standing as a tremendous talent. She is perfect for this role; her Katniss is tenacious, willful, and both terrified and determined. She's a skilled archer (has to be back home in order to find any food) but lacks a certain, shall we say, charm. Although she's not unattractive, she never smiles, seems resentful, and as a result is tough to get along with. Before the games, anyway. Through the tutelage of Cinna and Abernathy, she's able to show enough grace and poise to win some people over.It's a knockout performance. Sure, you're supposed to be rooting for her anyway, even though she isn't the underdog in the fight. She's the one with the compelling backstory - young sister and distant mother at home, father killed in mine accident. She has a lot to fight for. Lawrence can evoke respect and fear just by her expressive eyes. And, of course, the role itself is physically very demanding, and she's well up to the task. But Lawrence's great skill here is in engaging the audience to the point where even if they believe she will win, they desperately want to know how she'll accomplish it. Will she kill? Will she not kill someone? (Remember, only one can survive.)I like it when movies that seem to have a certain predictability about them - a predetermined finale, for example - throw in a twist that makes perfect sense but still isn't really foreseeable. As long as a seismic character change doesn't occur (such as a 'good' person very suddenly becoming 'bad' to further the plot), this is a welcome change - and it's tough to do. Big praise to The Hunger Games for throwing in twists that weren't laughable and to leaving the ending a little open ended in some regards. Not all loose ends are tied up. They often aren't in real life, either.So, as long as you don't closely question the movie's overall premise, you'll be very pleased with this film. It's well acted all around, immaculately shot and edited, and has intense, action scenes that will leave you as exhausted as the participants.",9,3,14,25 March 2012
The 13th Warrior," Antonino Banderas non-violent? Be still my heart!
","A group of twelve gruntin', scratchin', wandering Vikings is called back to its home by a child oracle to fight a deadly band of attackers. The oracle states, however, that there should also be a 13th warrior, one who is not from the north country. Enter Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas), an Arab who's just passing through and is already disgusted by the slovenly habits of the Vikings. So off goes the troupe. They're attacked a few times along the way, in the middle of the night as the fog rolls in (eerie!), and are stunned to find no casualties of their attackers, even though several were killed during each skirmish. Hmm! Turns out these are flesh-eaters, always part of myth but never seen even in those times. You know, one of those stories that's been handed down from generation to generation, but it's been so long since anyone who witnessed the stories firsthand was alive that the tales are more fiction than fact. Well, now our boys know what they're up against, but it takes them the entire movie to really get things going. For once, Banderas is not the hero, not the swashbuckler of 'The Mask of Zorro' or the gunslinger of 'Desperado.' The Vikings are the tough guys, and at first they patronize the outsider who doesn't speak their language. But soon he does, and soon he's one of the gang. Here's to male bonding!The plusses of this movie are its cinematography and atmosphere (even my TV set smelled a little murky) and solid action performances by a fine (and international) cast. Downside: there ARE some subtitles, especially at the beginning when the Vikings speak Nordic and Banderas stands, uncomprehending. I guess it's for his benefit as much as for our benefit that those subtitles are there, because he eventually learns the language simply by listening to them. So if you can take a grunting, scratching, me-big-male, chest-thumping movie, watch this.",7,0,2,5 March 2000
Shaun of the Dead," Yeah, boyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
","If you see only one zombie romantic comedy, this should be it. It's a perfect complement to (or substitute for, depending on your outlook) 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead, the two most recent zombie movies.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a salesman at a small electronics store. He lives with flatmates Ed (Nick Frost) and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz) and hangs out with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) at the local pub, the Winchester. Shaun's life is pretty stagnant at this point. He's 28 but directionless. Liz notices this problem and tells him to take a hike after Shaun bungles the reserving of a table for dinner. Dazed, Shaun gets drunk at the Winchester with Ed. It's not until after a few days of their bender that Shaun and Ed notice the walking dead.The zombies are more or less a metaphor for Shaun's life to that point; that he's just drifting from experience to experience without actually making anything of himself. He likes Ed, but he can't rely on him as a friend (Ed is also jobless); no one else in his social circle can stand Ed. Liz's flatmates don't like Shaun too much, because they think he neglects her. But Shaun isn't dislikable, he's just not all that.. there.The arrival of the living dead - their genesis is never explained, but it's moot - gives Shaun a chance to show he's not some senseless slacker who'd rather play video games or hang around in a pub. And it's at this point that the movie mirrors the earlier, more-serious zombie films, as he and his friends try to escape the clutches of the zombies.Shaun's personality doesn't change drastically, however; it's not as if he's suddenly transformed into Indiana Jones. He makes mistakes, but one thing is certain - Shaun. He appears full of life and confidence, inspiring his followers to .. well, to follow.Going from the promos, one would think this was full of nonstop laughs. Now, there were plenty of moments when I did laugh out loud, but a lot of the movie - especially the final 30 minutes or so - is fairly serious. Lighter than your usual run-of-the-mill living-dead movie, but not a hilarious film full of wacky hijinks. In some respect, that may have hurt the movie a little - people crack jokes when it seems more drama would be in order. And some of the characters are pretty darn unlikeable, and that never helps unless they're definitely the bad guys.",6,0,1,8 January 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Nearly as good as original
","Dead Man's Chest, the middle child in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy-to-be, really is a lot of fun, if not as wowing as the original. The main story - Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) must come up with 100 souls to satisfy a debt to supernatural Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), while Will (Orlando Bloom) must retrieve Jack's compass to save Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) from certain death - happily takes center stage, relegating the latter's romance to second-banana status. And that's a jolly good thing, too, because if there's anything to sink this wave-soaring vessel, it'd be a treacly kissy-kissy subplot.From the outset, bad things are afoot. Jack finds out the time's come to repay his debt to Jones, who commands a huge kraken to destroy ships. So Jack sets aground on a small island, which unfortunately is the home to a cannibal tribe. It's okay, though, because they think Jack's their god, but not so okay when they decide they need to free him from his fleshy existence - by killing and eating his crew.Will's sent by the new Lord, Cutler Beckett, to grab Jack's compass, else Will and Elizabeth will be killed. See, the compass leads to a key, which leads to a chest, the chest of one Davy Jones, and isn't it nice when the plot kind of comes full circle like that? I've always loved Johnny Depp. This is his first time in which he plays the same character in more than one movie; he's long been known as a stylish character actor, and the original Pirates made him more of a leading man. His Jack Sparrow is at once iconic and iconoclastic, daring you to like him and root for him despite all evidence to the contrary. Is he a treacherous scoundrel, or will he fight for his friends? Depp is clearly in his element here, making Sparrow his own - I don't think Disney would be able to find a suitable replacement, should the need arise.Bloom his more than his equal as Will Turner, which was a bit of a surprise. I liked him in the original, of course, but I thought he was a bit overshadowed by the nuanced Depp performance. Bloom's Turner here, though, is more commanding and charismatic, idealistic where Sparrow is ambiguous, a powerful performance.Knightley could have been just another pretty face, pouting and showing off her gleaming choppers, she instead is every bit as towering and rambunctious as her male counterparts, slashing and dashing about in a mad frenzy of catlike grace. Compare her work here to that in Domino, which featured a modicum of violence of its own sort, and it's a favorable comparison indeed. Where's the mouselike Knightley I see on red carpets? The final big star of the movie is the special effects and action scenes, from the massive kraken to sinking boats, from plenty of swordplay to chases through jungles and forests. It's a true testament to the on screen magic that while one never stops to think, 'How could this possibly happen?' one is also never overwhelmed by the bigness, the spectacle, the exasperating premise that louder is better. But the Whoa factor is in full effect, make no mistake.Full of spit and verve best suited to an angry pirate, Dead Man's Chest is full of what The Curse of the Black Pearl gave us. More of the same, in this instance, is well worth it, matey!",7,2,9,8 July 2006
Argo," Argo to Iran and all I got was this awesome movie
","A CIA operative enters Iran during the 1979-80 hostage crisis with the intention of bringing out six Americans who managed to escape the American embassy and are hiding in the Canadian embassy. He plans to do this by giving each a cover: together, they will represent a Canadian movie crew scouting Iran for filming locations for a Star Wars knockoff movie. The clincher? It all really happened.At first, the students who took over the American embassy do not know that six of their captives are missing, which buys everyone some time. The CIA brainiacs try to figure out a way to extradite them to the US. Have them pose as teachers? There are no American teachers left in Iran - they'd be spotted. Have them escape via bicycle? It's winter, no one's riding a bike. How about as farmers? See above. There's snow in Iran. And then Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, who also directed) gets the idea of getting the Americans out by way of Hollywood. Tensions are extremely high. There is anti-American hatred in the streets of Tehran, and there's plenty of anti-Iranian sentiment in the U.S. as well. The students want to show the world that they mean business, but the U.S. doesn't negotiate with terrorists. Things don't look good, especially with the knowledge that inevitably someone will notice that six Americans are missing among the captured. Time is not on our side.Since the premise of the six Americans' cover is that of a Canadian film crew, there needs to be a script. And a producer, and a director. Mendez contacts John Chambers (John Goodman), a veteran makeup/costume artist, who brings in at-the-end-of-his-career Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin). They find a script, called Argo, that involves an alien invasion. They option the rights and set up an office. It all must look legit; no chances can be taken.Getting Mendez into Iran is not too difficult; it's getting his 'crew' out that's the fly in the ointment. Meanwhile, the houseguests at the Canadian embassy are getting restless and paranoid. They can't go outside. The only other residents at the embassy are the ambassador and the housekeeper, who is Iranian. Something's gotta give, as they say.This true story was declassified only in 1997 by President Clinton, and from what I have read, the story was left basically intact. Amazing. A single American enters a place in which Americans are essentially hated and departs with six more. That's some serious moxie. Them's some serious cojones for sure.Affleck's quick-paced film is stunning and evocative; a compelling, artful piece of work. He's well cast as Mendez, an operative who generally looks like he's lost, utterly alone, in the world, hoping that this mission will save him from himself. We get just enough of Mendez's backstory to see him as a sympathetic man with a lot on the line.It could be that 2012 winds up being one of the best years for movies in quite a long time, and as such it might be hard for Argo to dominate as it might in other years. But it should do very well come awards time. It's already been nominated for five Golden Globes, and I can believe Oscar nods for Arkin, Affleck (thrice), Terrio, and co-producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov. Watching the movie can be a traumatic experience. History isn't always the best subject of Americans, so let me clue you in on this much: If Mendez had been unsuccessful, we wouldn't be watching a movie about the experience. Even those who were not alive in 1980 will be riveted, rooting for the Americans, cringing when obstacles arise, weeping when those obstacles are overcome. Chris Terrio's screenplay is powerful, but it's the interpretations given by Affleck, Goodman, Arkin, and Bryan Cranston (as Affleck's boss, and looking a LOT like George H. W. Bush) that really generate this film's strength. It's a genuinely astonishing movie, tightly edited, crisply written, and acted with true grit. Affleck himself turns in a particularly gutsy performance.",9,0,3,6 January 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Yes! Better than the first one
","In this second movie in the reboot of the original movies based on the old TV show, Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the Enterprise must face not only the renegade bad guy but also himself. Yes, I know, it's deep. Star Trek Into Darkness is, however, even better than its immediate predecessor, with spellbinding effects that actually look good in 3D, fleshed-out characterizations, and fine acting all around.It's a year after the events in the first movie, and Kirk (Chris Pine) and company have been sent to a remote planet to observe and report. They discover that an active volcano is about to erupt, which would eradicate the indigenous society. Ignoring the Prime Directive, Kirk has Spock (Zachary Quinto) lowered into the volcano via shuttle and line to place and then detonate a nuclear device that would render the volcano inert. But, as they tend to do in ST films, things go wrong and Kirk has to reveal the hidden Enterprise to the society in order to rescue Spock. That's just the leadup. At Starfleet HQ, Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood) is livid. You see, Kirk's report terms the trip as 'uneventful'; Spock's, however, details everything. The insubordination, the unwillingness to follow the rules, the hubris, and the lack of humility, all add up to Kirk's being stripped of command and demoted, with Spock to be transferred. However, an emergency meeting of top Starfleet brass is convened to discuss the recent bombing of a Starfleet building that housed archives. The meeting itself is attacked by a former Starfleet agent named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who then flees to an uninhabited part of the distant Klingon homeworld of Kronos. The Enterprise, with Kirk at the helm - but minus Scotty - takes off after Harrison, armed with 72 long-range missiles; the idea is to park just outside Klingon space, aim the torpedoes at Harrison, and fire away. But things...well, you know the drill. Things ain't what they seem to be.There are plot revelations in this movie in almost every other scene, and certainly I won't go into them here. They all made sense (save for one, which seemed more like a red herring than anything else). But one point you should know going into this movie: a man without peace may desire war, the best way to gain power.Elements of some of the original films are in play here. I think this rebooting is better than, say, redoing the Batman or Superman sagas every so often, because director J.J. Abrams simply grabs some plot points from various iterations of the series and inserts them at rational points. There is a feeling of real progression, that the crew grows with each mission, especially Kirk himself. Their transformations are sometimes excellent foreshadowing and sometimes elegant and subtle.I also feel that the actors playing the crew members are growing into their roles, growing together as a cohesive unit. We no longer see one person doing one job, incapable of helping; they are a team much more like the The Next Generation gang was, less like The Original Series.The acting ranges from adequate to fantastic. Loved Pine and Quinto, who have several difficult, emotional scenes; loved Zoe Saldana as Lt. Uhura, Anton Yelchin as Ensign Chekov, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, John Cho as Lt. Sulu, and especially Simon Pegg as Lt. Cmdr. Scotty. None is a liability; all seem well cast and developed. In fact, we o get to know a little more about Uhura, Spock, and Scotty, and I suspect in future ST films we'll get more backstory as needed.Star Trek Into Darkness does contain quite a bit of dazzling effects, and it might be best seen in 3D. Even in 2D, it would be a spectacle to watch. It's one of those rare films that combines visual wizardry with an actual compelling plot and multidimensional characters.It is possible that real Trek fans will be displeased with the movie. Some may have wanted a replica of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Some may have wanted a completely original story. The writers and director knew very well that they couldn't possibly please all mega fans, so they boldly chose a third path. The movie is, above all, a believable entry that is both faithful and original to the Trek universe.",9,45,90,18 May 2013
Hostel," Disgusting! But fun!
","Hostel is half suspense thriller and half gorefest. Most people won't like the level of violence and blood and such, but for those who are fond of splatterfests, it'll be like a Renoir you'd love to have in your collection of fine, gross art.Three youths backpacking through Europe find themselves in a Slovakian youth hostel. It's all they've ever wanted - even better than Amsterdam! The girls are gorgeous and (most importantly) willing, especially concerning young Americans. Even better, the boys have to room with two local lovelies who like to walk around naked and party hardy with their new friends.But strange things are afoot. Ole (Eythor Gudjonsson) goes missing; the front desk says he's checked out, and his pals Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) receive a phone message from him saying he's gone home. And a Japanese guest at the hostel says her friend's missing, too. What's up with that? The first half of the movie is titillating, with plenty of go-thither scenes of fantastic debauchery, wickedly enticing the average male viewer with promises of drinking, toking, and hardcore fornication. I mean, how dare they? Here I am, trying to write a serious review of a nasty horror movie, and they have to muck it up by showing me plenty of gratuitous nudity! Not that there's nothing for the rest of the audience. Okay, there's not much. The first half is aimed squarely at the heterosexual hedonist male. But then we get to the second half, and we get to see what happens when Josh passes out in his room and wakes up in the torture chamber.This is the moment you'd start covering your eyes, shooing small children from the room, warning people with heart conditions, and so on. Of course, they probably didn't watch the nakedness, anyway, and in fact aren't even in the room, choosing instead to lambaste you from the other side of a thick door. I mean, how dare you bring such filth into their home? Why don't you bring it into your own home, you pervert? For the most part, the blood looks awfully real, but the editing is so well - pardon the pun - executed that you hardly have time to see how authentic it all appears. The point is, it feels darn authentic. Everything, from the actions of the psychopaths to the reactions of the victims feels pretty sincere.Scary, creepy, and disgusting, Hostel is of the same - ahem - cut as Saw: a polished, well-shot (heh), squishy-sick horror film.",7,2,2,17 May 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Whimsical delight
","The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a magnificent movie, a paradoxically quick epic that doesn't rely on the viewers' being familiar with the source material. It's about four young London siblings who are sent away from home after the Blitz to live with relatives in the country, and who stumble upon an amazing new world entered through the back of an old closet.Anyone who's read C. S. Lewis's books will instantly fall for the elegant way this story is told, from the gorgeous scenery to the wide-eyed innocence and brilliant performances of its mostly young cast. Often with a group of young actors, there's little to distinguish one novice thespian from another, no quirks in personality other than the most rudimentary. But Narnia's Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter are each their own person; and what's more, each grows in his and her own way throughout the movie, however subtly.Tilda Swinton is riveting as the evil White Witch, dancing a mighty thin line between hammy and calculating. I believe her screen gravitas alone gave encouragement to the young foursome, headed by Georgie Henley as Lucy, the waif who first stumbles upon the then-frozen land of Narnia. But as I said, each of the Pevensie kids distinguishes themselves in the film, no small task when the indomitable Ms. Swinton is aboard.The movie would be little more than a live-action cartoon, though, if not for the fantastic, realistic CGI used for the animals, particularly that of the enigmatic lion Aslan, voiced by the great Liam Neeson. Not to be outdone, Ray Winstone's Mr. Beaver was a true Cockney treat. All of the graphics, though, were quite believable with nary a moment's hesitation. Well done, indeed. The Chronicles of Narnia should garner a Academy Award nomination for visual effects or set design, I would think.The movie is fairly rated PG for some frightening moments, but it's nothing your kids can't handle (probably). If you've read the books, you know there's one particular scene that might be a tad upsetting to the juniors, but rest assured all will be aright one way or another in the end.",7,0,0,30 January 2006
The Babadook," Shallow, disappointing junk
","Although interesting to look at, The Babadook is an appalling mess of a horror film, with irritating characters, a lack of genuine suspense, and a style that's more likely to evoke mild bemusement than sincere dread and terror.The premise is a familiar one. Young Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is seemingly haunted by a spirit that no one else can see, and of course no one else believes said spirit exists, least of all his mother Amelia (Essie Davis), who's struggling with the sudden, violent death of her husband and sees Samuel's 'ghost' as Samuel's way of dealing with his own grief.Things kick into a higher gear when Samuel finds a book called The Babadook on his bookshelf. No kids' book this, The Babadook is about an out-to-get-you entity, complete with terrifying artwork and menacing words. It's so scary that Amelia can't stomach reading it all to Samuel. This ain't no ordinary book. The Babadook will come a-calling, first to the child in disguise and then to the kid's mother; then it'll just do it's haunting thing. The better to drive you insane, my dear.Samuel begins to act out. I got the impression that he'd been having behavioral issues (likely stemming from his dad's death), but once the book arrives, those issues increase infinitely in intensity. He misbehaves in school, at the park, and at his cousin's party; at the latter, he pushes his obnoxious, teasing cousin out of a treehouse, which enrages his aunt. So much for family and understanding, right? Eventually, Amelia is able to secure some medication for Samuel to keep him calm, but soon the spectre of the Babadook is in her head, too.A few points. First, even in recent memory there have been plenty of nobody-believes-I'm-being-haunted plots. Even with the children's book as a hook, this story is well worn indeed. But what really counts against it is that the kid is so over-the-top horrible from the beginning of the movie that it's nigh impossible to feel any real sympathy for him - until and unless the plot says it must be so. Samuel is, to put it bluntly, a real jerk. He's mean to everyone and disobeys his mom constantly.Sure, we can explain this away by pointing to the dad's death (he died in an accident on the way to the hospital when Samuel was born) - but since he never knew his dad, it feels like the logic is twisting to suit a screenwriter's desperate needs. Samuel is so obnoxious that he spends about the first twenty minutes screaming 'MOM' at the top of his lungs. I'm sure you parents out there can relate to how wonderfully appealing this sound is. It's so nice to be wanted.When Amelia herself inevitably becomes haunted by the Babadook as well, things get progressively worse. She's angry! She's normal! She's loving! She's cruel! She's seeing things! She's experiencing reality! It's a whirlwind of lazy, lazy writing. And, true to the trope, no one believes Amelia's claims that Something is happening - not the school, which clearly doesn't care about Samuel's well being; not her sister, who doesn't stop to consider that Amelia may truly need her help; not the Child Services people, who drop in unannounced and have no idea why this person is cleaning the kitchen because of a hole in the wall that doesn't exist. No one cares. Maybe that's because everyone involved saw the first part of the film, in which neither mother nor son comes off as particularly sympathetic.I got the impression that this movie merely needed a better director (than Jennifer Kent), writer (Kent), and actors (Davis and especially Wiseman). That's not asking too much, right? In the right hands, The Babadook would have been a stylish, Gothic psychological drama, but instead it's a run-of-the-mill plot sunk by aimless direction and a real lack of panache. There are just too many ludicrous scenes in this film to stomach. William Friedkin, of all people, claims that he's never seen a more terrifying film than this one; we can thus infer that Mr. Friedkin has never seen his own horror classic, The Exorcist.",2,3,10,27 April 2015
Us," Peele's best work, at least until the next one.
","Jordan Peele's sophomore effort is simply astonishing. When I first saw the trailer for Us, I was reminded of Walt Kelly's proclamation in Pogo - We have met the enemy, and he is Us. On the one hand, the movie works as a straightforward horror film about doppelgangers wreaking havoc on their 'real' counterparts, but there's so much more going on. Peele forces us to examine what we think 'good' and 'bad' actually entail and whether there can be smidges of both in the same person. Watching this film, I found it amazing that Peele got his start in comedy; he seems like a practiced hand at psychological horror, with layers upon layers that will definitely put your brain into hyperdrive. And anchoring the whole thing, with two smashing performances, is Lupita Nyong'o, one of the best actresses of her generation. Us is a powerful film that makes forceful statements about what it means to be a human, an American, a male, a woman, and/or a have-not. The cinematography is surreal (watch out for the house of mirrors!), and the Peele expertly juggles the light and dark tones throughout. This is a masterful work.",9,5,14,24 March 2019
The Girl Next Door," Uneven, but quite funny
","A mixed bag, this is a story of a high school senior Matt (Emile Hirsch), who's on the verge of getting a choice scholarship to Georgetown University - and the lovely young lady who moves in next door, who happens to be a porn star.It's every boy-on-the-verge-of-becoming-a-man's dream. Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) is stunning, charming, personable, and she likes Matt. But can she reconcile her past - which is always pulling her back - with his present?At alternate times, I laughed VERY hard and cringed even harder. See, the problem is in the pacing - the director didn't seem sure whether this was supposed to be a slapstick sex comedy or a more serious drama. And that's a huge shame, because some of the scenes in this movie were fantastic, especially the denouement.A huge plus is Cuthbert, who simply lights up every scene she's in with seemingly effortless charisma. Every smile, every time she bit her upper lip, males everywhere got a little sweatier. She's a real find; she has true screen presence.But trust me when I say I really laughed hard several times during this movie. True,it had some twists that were thoroughly unnecessary (and that altered the tone considerably), but all in all this was a real tr",7,0,1,3 September 2004
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Solid, won't melt your heart
","Even before Ice Age grossed a gabillion habillion dollars, it was inevitable that there would be a sequel, because duh, the Ice Age eventually spurned a new age, which I will call the Not Ice Age. Otherwise we'd all be frozen and speaking Inuit. But I digress.Last time, the sudden appearance of a human infant brought an unlikely crew together: a woolly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a sloth. This time, Manny, Diego, and Sid have a new mission - get the holy heck out of the way before the giant ice damn breaks and floods everything and drowns all of those who cannot swim, which would be just about everyone. On top of that, Manny (Ray Romano) is fearful that he's the very last of his kind. And on top of THAT, Diego (Denis Leary) must face his fears. Only everyone knows tigers have no fears, so I'm sure he has nothing to worry about.At first, the boys are sure that nothing's melting, there's nothing to see here, please move along, and they tell a gathered crowd to ignore the mad ravings of Fast Tony (Jay Leno!), who's full of doom and gloom and anything else that'll make him some money. (Although what use these animals would have for money is not explained.) But then, at the top of the dammed hill thingy, they notice that the water seems a bit higher and the ice seems a bit less... present. Whoops! Guess everything really is melting after all. So they change their minds (and everyone else's) and head AWAY from the impending doom. Where to, you ask? Well, according to the vultures, there's a boat way over yonder, and if everyone can get over there before the damn bursts, then they'll be able to ride the deluge out.Meanwhile, Manny's his usual morose self. Glum, even. He mopes about, wondering if he truly is the last of his kind when BOOM something lands on him from a tree branch. It's another mammoth! Only she thinks she's am opossum. It's a long story (well, about 80 minutes long), but basically Elly was raised by opossums Crash and Eddie and thinks she's one of them, despite the painfully obvious fact that she's about nine tons larger and can't hide as well. But hey, she's not quibbling.So here's Manny, the very picture of awkwardness, Mister Insensitivity his own darn self, and he has to convince Ellie, Miss I'm Not a Mammoth (Queen Latifah) not only that she is indeed a mammoth but that at some point she should totally fall for him so they can repopulate the species. Hey, whatever line works for you, Manfred ol' bean. And Diego and Sid have to put up with the overly energetic antics of the 'possom brothers (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck, the latter from Nickelodeon's Drake and Josh), basically being pains in the butt. Oh, but don't worry, they'll always stick up for their 'sister.' The movie is mostly enjoyable. It's lacking a little bit of the charm and heart of the original, but since this is a movie aimed at an audience a tad younger than me, it's all good. I sort of found the opossums to be annoying, not clever, and even Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) got on my nerves from time to time. Ironically, although Manny seemed out of place in the first one, he looked much more at home here. Maybe Romano just needed a movie to grow into the role. But the one who sold me wholeheartedly was Leary, who steals about every scene he's in, bringing real life and a sardonic edge to his character.",7,0,0,18 December 2006
Balls of Fury," Deflated balls
","Balls of Fury is amiable to the point of being gregarious, but many of its jokes - verbal and visual - either just miss or misfire completely, and when it's over you start thinking of better ways you could have spent the previous ninety minutes. Highlights include Christopher Walken's waaaaay over the top performance as Feng, a mysterious, rich, eccentric ping pong fan; Thomas Lennon as an ubermean German Olympian; the luxuriant Maggie Q as a table tennis champion who dresses in skimpy short-shorts; and comically terrified male sex slaves.Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) was once a promising young ping ponger. Back in 1988, he made the U.S. Olympic team and was all set (at age 12) to win against Lennon's Karl Wolfschtagg when he slipped and fell and couldn't return a serve, thus not only losing his chance at a medal but also sealing his father's fate, as the elder Daytona had bet heavily on the match. Years later, the adult Randy is approached by FBI Agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) to help the government nail the guy who had Randy's pop iced - a mysterious man named Feng, whose face no one's photographed or even seen. The feds know Feng's up to evil plans, but they need Randy to enter a private, super-secret ping pong tournament run by Feng at his undisclosed lair so they can get the goods on him.Randy sucks at ping pong now, though, so he must undergo Karate Kid-like training under the wise tutelage of the blind Master Wong (James Hong). To make sure no stereotypes are left alone, Wong also runs a Chinese restaurant. Oh well, at least he doesn't say the whole training bit is an ancient Chinese secret. Anyway, Wong's got a niece, or daughter, I've already forgotten which, who is superdupercrazygood at competitive ping pong. She can even fend off four players while taking orders over the phone at the restaurant, she's that darn good. Of course, it falls to her - that would be Maggie Q playing (get this) a woman named Maggie - to train the living bejeezus out of Randy. It should be pointed out here that while Maggie is sensual, gorgeous, and overall wonderful, Randy is fat, slovenly, a little sarcastic. In other words, it's a typical movie love-match, isn't it? From the moment Maggie puts Randy's arm in a chicken wing, you know they're gonna hook up.But the real fun comes at Feng's tournament. For one thing, Walken's Feng is wearing a different outfit every time you see him, seemingly; he's sort of like Ming the Merciless, only not as bland. Walken vamps like only Walken can vamp, but it's sort of easy to steal a movie from guys like Fogler and Lopez. Even so, it's hard to overstate how much Walken overacts, even for Walken. If you're not a Walken fan, that is to say, you'll find nothing to like about this movie. Sure, some may call it hammy acting, but it's acting... nonetheless... isn't it? Then there's the tourney itself - it's sudden death, you see, and that's meant literally. Lose, and you get a blowdart to the neck, courtesy of Feng's right-hand chica, played by Aisha Tyler. And of course, along the way the underdog Randy must face his old enemy Karl, who so gleefully ended Daytona's amateur - and professional - career nearly twenty years earlier. But Randy's not even sure he wants to stick around, seeing as how everyone's getting killed. He's funny like that.Balls of Fury, brought to you by the guys behind Reno 911 and A Night at the Museum, does have its moments of funny, but by and large it suffers from a scattershot script and haphazard directing - it looks almost like it's some film student's final thesis project thingy. It's not quite as good as it should have been, and it's not nearly funny enough to be worth a theater ticket.",5,2,3,5 September 2007
Ted," Ted: comedy cred but movie dead
","Think of Ted as an R-rated version of the latest Muppets movie. Ted is a stuffed bear who magically comes to life when an eight-year-old boy makes a wish while a shooting star passes by (he doesn't seem to know about the star, though). The bear and the boy become best pals, through childhood and into adulthood. You can also think of Ted as an even raunchier episode of Family Guy, or even the short-lived series Greg the Bunny. Fast forward 27 years, and John (Mark Wahlberg) is now a 35-year-old slouching slacker who's happiest just sitting on his couch getting stoned with, yes, Ted. I mean, the dude does have a job at a car-rental place, but he's clearly going nowhere. He does have one truly awesome thing going for him, though - he's dating Lori (Mila Kunis), who's as down to earth, raw, and crass as Ted and John, so she fits right in. Trouble is, she and John have been dating for four years (!) now, and he's getting the impression that she's ready for more. It's a tug of war. Does John jettison Ted in favor of Lori, who feels (very rightly) that Ted is holding John back. Sort of like how, in the Muppet movie, Amy Adams is a tad uncomfortable with Walter the Muppet coming between her and Jason Segal. Anyway, Lori gives John chance after chance to get his act together. At one point, Ted moves out, into a seedy apartment. Eh, it's okay, though, because there are plenty of hookers around. The bear gets busy, you know what I mean?As with most Seth Macfarlane projects, there is a ton of pop-culture humor. You can't escape it. Some of it works, some of it doesn't work at all; luckily, even some of the bad stuff comes off as self deprecating, as if Macfarlane knows the humor ain't quite there. There's an interesting homage to Airplane! at one point, and it works. Now, the reason the Muppet movie could take this approach and make it work was that it was sweetly sentimental, an homage to a bygone era. It was cute and funny and mainly for kids or adults who can't let go of the past. Ted, on the other hand, takes the same approach and just amps up the adult content. You want drugs? Yep. Drink? Yep. Naked women? Of course there's naked women, and there are plenty of references to what Ted (uh huh) can and will do to them. It's weird, it's creepy, and it's expected.The plot itself is pedestrian. Everyone needs someone. Ted needs John, John needs Ted, John needs Lori, Lori needs John. Ted leaves, John feels bad, Ted convinces John to party, Lori finds out, Lori leaves John, Ted gets kidnapped... oh yes, there's a kidnapping, too, with a seedy dad (Giovanni Ribisi) and his needy kid. It's a side plot that's really unnecessary except to give us a car chase and a race up the Green Monster at Fenway Park. Have I given too much away? Of course not. The plot isn't that big of a mystery, anyway; it's the jokes you come for. Okay, let me put it this way. If you like Family Guy but always felt the creators (Macfarlane) were holding back because of TV censors, then you'll find plenty of laughs here, scattered though they may be. If you've never been a Family Guy fan, you probably won't get into this too much anyway. Sometimes the pop references are funny on their own but make zero logical sense. For example, Ted at one point brags about having met Norah Jones at a Belinda Carlisle party and having sex with her in a closet. Considering how close Ted and John are supposed to be throughout the movie, it really isn't likely that the teddy bear would be off at Hollywood parties while the human is stuck in Boston. Yes, you read me right. I accept a talking stuffed animal, but that's it.If I were to pick just one thing that I loved about the movie, though, it would be the ethereal-yet-humanistic Mila Kunis, who makes for a terrific girlfriend. She's not a caricature (a bit of a surprise); she doesn't demand things from John, hates to issue ultimata (but of course does have to), can joke as nastily as her male counterparts, and is an all-around good person with real feelings, characteristics I wouldn't expect to see in a Seth Macfarlane movie. Maybe it's to make up for all of the crap Kunis' character Meg takes on Family Guy (never seen such a hated character). In any event, Kunis is terrific, better than the material, by far the best part of the entire movie. It's nice to be beautiful, I'm sure, but it's wonderful to be talented.Ted was never meant to be for everyone, that's for sure. You love raunch, well, then this movie is drenched in raunch dressing. And off- color, non-PC jokes. Some of it is painfully unfunny (who thought having Mark Wahlberg sing was a good idea). Some of the scattered references do stick a little, so it's not a wasted effort - as long as you count yourself among the intended audience.",5,1,3,28 July 2012
Spider-Man 2," Maintains the energy of the first one
","A cut above the typical comic book movie, S-M 1 did what this type of movie is supposed to do: introduce the main characters, have 'em fight a Super Bad Guy, and then have it all end happily ever after, for the most part. In other words, for the first movie in a supposed franchise, you have to allow time for exposition of the protagonist's background, even if millions already know him from another medium.With S-M 2, though, such an obligation isn't necessary. We've met Spidey, MJ, Aunt May, et al., and we're ready to jump into a new story. So while the first one explains why Spidey is, the second movie devotes more time to fighting the Bad Guy du Jour, Doctor Octopus.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) still pines for MJ (Kirsten Dunst), from whom he steers clear despite his undying affection for her. It's for her own good, he tells himself. If we're together, my enemies will top at nothing to get at me through her, and I can't put her in that position. And so, in typical superhero fashion, he broods and broods and broods. The relentless push-and-pull between his love for MJ and his devotion to using his powers for good is a constant theme in the Spider-Man universe, and in the movies it either smolders in the background or charges with a raging fury to the forefront. Peter is given the impossible choice - true love or good deeds - and it's a choice to which, at its core, everyday people can relate; we all have exceedingly difficult choices to make throughout our lives.And in this especially, the movies succeed. Peter Parker is supposed to be an average teen - well, except for those powers he has. He's not morally superior. He's not smarter. He's just a poor schlub who accidentally has these super powers, and he doesn't quite know how to deal with them. On a smaller scale, a comparison can be made to a supremely talented collegiate football player who's just made it to the pros. He has otherworldly talents. He has money, fame, fortune. And can he handle it? About as well as Peter can.Anyway, the big villain here is the aforementioned Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), yet another in a long line of Good Scientists Gone Wrong. You may recall that the Green Goblin from the first S-M movie was also of this line. This Doc has found a way to manipulate metallic tentacles with his mind. (It helps that the tentacles are physically attached to him.) Something goes wrong, he goes mad, and next thing you know it, he's gonna take over the world. Give these boys a Happy Meal, and they'd still want two prizes.Along with the inevitable Spidey-Doc Ock battles, Peter Parker's best friend Harry (James Franco) is still quite resentful as Spidey's killing of his father in the first movie. He doesn't know Peter is Spider-Man, but he knows only Peter is able to take photographs of him. So the second thematic struggle is within Harry - does he resent his friend for knowing the murderer (in his eyes) of his father? All of the cast returns from the first movie (well, all that survived the first movie), and they all do a collective good job. Maguire is a perfect choice for the lead; he's unassuming, can't really emote, is stoic, and even a little bit wimpy. All are qualities that plague the characters of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker.",8,92,143,20 December 2004
Billy Elliot," Skip the last dance
","An 11-year old boy from a working-class British family is torn between his desire to learn ballet and his father's wish for him to learn boxing. Billy's father is headstrong and medieval in his worldly outlook, as he only wants manly things for his son. But Billy sees something more in the poetry of ballet, and he wants more than anything else to be as fluid and graceful as those sinewy dancers.   Having established the conflict of the story from the outset, the movie takes us through Billy's struggles to complete his ballet training privately (under the tutelage of Mrs. Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters). It's a great idea for a movie, really, because of the stark contrast between the outside world of Billy's neighborhood (which exists under the spectre of an ominous protracted workers' strike, of which Billy's father participates) and the inner workings of Billy's decidedly unmanly mind. However, the film is hit or miss. If the viewer allows himself or herself to become fully wrapped up in Billy's predicament, much as one would approach a soap opera, then one will fall for this unabashed schmaltz-fest with no problems. But for the more cynical among us, the movie fails in that it plays out virtually every Hollywood cliche imaginable; the only true original notion in the movie is the basic 'boy wants to be a ballet dancer' ideal. Here are some tried-and-true portions of the movie: Boy wants to do something against dad's wishes. Boy's dad is a tough-as-nails cretin, stolidly stupid but somewhere, deep inside, he loves his boy. Then there's the unforgiving teacher (Mr. Miyagi, anyone?). And the Impossible Dream. The list goes on and one. When I first popped this in the ol' DVD player, I accidentally set it to play in French (at least I think that's what that was...) Then I stopped it and switched the settings. Guess what? The overwrought Cockney accents are, at times, absolutely indecipherable. It's like watching a foreign film, only not as full of deep meaning.   In short, this can be a real snorefest if you're not ready to become one with the plight of poor Master Elliot. If you are, more power to you; time for you to dust off that old copy of Love Story. But if you're like the rest of us, skip it unless you're suffering from sleep deprivation.",5,0,5,27 April 2001
127 Hours," Gripping, transcendental
","127 Hours is one of those infrequent movies that makes great use out of its limited resources; in this case, its space. It's about a hiker, played by James Franco, who finds himself partially trapped by a rock, pinned against the wall of a crevasse. It's a stunning, visually visceral film with a couple of gut-churning scenes, but overall it is a magnificent, evocative thriller.Franco is Aron Ralston, a thrill seeker who loves, loves, loves the desert around Moab, Utah. And with good reason; the aerial shots give a terrific sense of just how isolated and beautiful the area is. He's hiking the Blue John Canyon when he runs into inexperienced hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn), whom he cheerfully helps get back on track. It's shortly after departing from the young ladies that Aron, descending into a small fissure, slips, dislodging a medium-sized boulder, which inconveniently lands on his right arm, pinning it against the rock wall.Throughout Ralston's ordeal, he reexamines his life and concludes that he's in his position because of his own decisions, and not just the one in which he neglected to tell anyone of his whereabouts. 'All my life I've been heading toward this rock,' he thinks; his new insight leads him to conclude that he's let a lot of opportunities slip by in his selfish quest to do things on his own.The movie is based on a real-life occurrence, so it's probably no spoiler to learn that the young man does somehow survive his predicament. But it's not that result that makes this so captivating. Even if you've learned beforehand just how Aron is able to extricate himself, the scene is intense, grisly, and tough to watch. It's the kind of scene that makes you want to look away and ahead at the same time.A lot of the film's success depends on Franco himself. Like Ryan Reynolds last year in Buried, Franco is front and center; it's all about Aron, his past and present, and the lack of mobility means much must be told through Franco's expression and one-armed activities. And he's up to the task. Franco's performance here must have been physically excruciating in and of itself, as much of the cavern scenes were filmed in one sitting. But he also brings quite a bit of emotional tension to the role, and I wouldn't be surprised if he managed to get an Oscar nom out of it.The film does have its flaws. One problem in mysteries and other thrillers is the pull-the-rug gambit, wherein the filmmakers make the audience think A, then switch to B, then repeat ad infinitum. After a while, the viewer isn't sure what's real and what they're supposed to think. Here, director Danny Boyle does trick you a few times; is what Aron sees a hallucination, or is it real? Aron makes quick video recordings while trapped, documenting his efforts. This adds more realism (how else would we know what he's done?) and engages the audience. It also allows us to see all sides of the young man; show-off, extrovert, implacable logician, terrified prisoner. Aron's epiphanies are so vivid that we feel as terrible as he does.But there's a big upside to that realism. When the (obvious) ending does come, the result is so cathartic that it's unlikely that an average viewer could be unmoved by it. The emotional buildup during the course of the movie is justified by a denouement that just blew me away.",9,0,2,9 January 2011
Pirate Radio," Loud and proud
","Pirate Radio, otherwise known as The Boat that Rocked, is an exciting, somewhat-based-on-fact account of a floating radio station anchored off the coast of Britain in the mid-1960s. The (mostly) Brit cast is unfailingly hilarious, and the movie doesn't dwell on emotional issues, thus keeping the festivities from getting too dull. And, indeed, it rocks.The story takes us through the coming of age of one Carl (Tom Sturridge), who's been sent to live on the Radio Rock ship to live with his uncle Quentin (Bill Nighy), who runs the pirate radio station. There, Young Carl is indoctrinated in the ways of rock and roll - the movie's set in 1966, with Beatlemania in full swing - as well as the ways of the world. Escorting him into maturity are The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Dr. Dave (Nick Frost), Simple Simon (Chris O'Dowd), and Midnight Mark (Tom Wisdom). Added to the mix is the legendary Gavin Kavanagh, played with élan by Rhys Ifans, returning to the airwaves after being exiled to the US.Meanwhile, the British government takes notice, and one straight-backed bureaucrat, played with oily glee by Kenneth Branagh, is determined to shut down all of the pirate radio stations. Branagh seems like he's playing John Cleese playing a stubborn stuffed shirt, and truth be told I didn't even recognize him as Kenneth Branagh until well into the picture.There's plenty of music - a lot of it anachronistically thrown into the mix - but hardly any musical montages, which is a refreshing change. I figured we'd see scenes of the crew swabbing the deck to the kicking tunes of Jan and Dean. But no, we hear a lot of great period music in the background, which only serves the plot well.Ifans is a real delight as the egomaniacal Kavanagh, with a voice so velvety smooth, he's like a white Barry White. Aw, yeah. Hoffman is his equal as the irascible, irreducibly singular Count, an expat from America who doesn't cotton to the stupid, draconian English laws. Each is necessary; without the other, each would be just another faux leader of this band of misfits, but together... well, together they can work against each other. It's fun watching their egos clash.The movie works chiefly because everyone seems like he's having a grand old time playing records and thumbing his nose at the establishment. This was just before the great sweeping activism bug that bit America (or just at its cusp), and rock and roll was a huge, huge part of that; it seems quaint, now, that Britain in the sixties forbade its playing on the radio. Can you imagine that today? Now, we have subscriber-supported satellite radio on which any number of foul-themed shows can appear with impunity, and the airwaves themselves are a little more lax than they used to be.",8,2,3,3 July 2010
"I Love You, Man"," No Love
","I Love You Man, despite a fine premise and sincere comedic overtones, falls flat, a victim of a scattershot script that’s never sure when it wants us to take everyone seriously and as a result never quite finds its way. Paul Rudd stars as a schlub who proposes to his fiancé (Rashida Jones) and then spends half the movie trying to find some guy, any guy, to be his best man, since he’s lacking in buds.Along the way, he finds his new best friend ever in the person of Sydney Fife (Jason Segal), a wacky truth-telling soulmate who slowly begins to pry the hapless Pete away from his betrothed. Hilarity doesn’t quite ensue as much wander around aimlessly and flop down on a beanbag chair.Pete’s a nice guy who has no guy friends at all. (I can sort of relate.) He’s always had girl friends, as opposed to girlfriends. Oh, let’s just call them gal pals. When Zooey asks him who he’s going to have as his best man, though, he’s at a loss. His dad? Nah, his dad’s best friends with Pete’s younger brother (Andy Samberg). Guys at work? Nah, they’re a bunch of go-getting, artificially tanned prima donnas. What about his fencing club? Nah, he doesn’t hang with them. So instead, on the advice of his brother, Pete goes on a series of “man dates” to find his special bro. One of these in particular, played by Thomas Lennon, has a surprise of his own.But sort of by accident, he runs into Sydney, a dude who’s all that. Sydney listens and likes to hang with Pete. It’s sort of like courting a new girlfriend, really. And all of a sudden, Pete’s doing less wedding planning and more gallivanting, which is a word I picked up reading Hardy Boys mysteries. Now he’s going to Rush concerts and jamming on the bass.For the most part, Rudd nails the part of the guy who’s just too awkward to fit in with the other guys. But he’s a little too awkward. One of the running jokes in the film is that Pete just can’t get the hang of new-fangled slang. Like when Syd calls him “Pistol” after Pete Maravich, and Pete can’t come up with anything that’s not completely unfunny. Not even funny in the amusingly cute and dorky way. He’s a classic dweeb, and yet here he is a realtor. (One of his clients, in another amusing gag, is Lou Ferrigno.) Because Pete’s so incredibly awkward, he’s a little hard to root for. If you’re the popular kind (or were back in the day), you feel a little guilty, laughing at Pete’s inadequacies. And if you’re the unpopular kind, you cringe a little, knowing perhaps it’s a bit too dead-on of a portrayal.I also found it a bit difficult to tell where Sydney was coming from. Was he a good guy after all? Could this be a movie where the good guy turns out to be bad but it’s just a woeful misunderstanding? His motives were unclear until the end, when it was too late for me to care. He’s also a little annoying (he has some jumbly logic for not cleaning up after his dog, for instance) and creepy.There are jokes here, mostly at Pete’s expense, and I understand that the movie wanted to be sensitive and meaningful while still being crude and raunchy, but it never found a middle ground to enjoy the best of both worlds. The laughs were good when they were there, but they were so scattershot that they felt like shooting icicles from a handgun. OK, bad simile, but you get the drift.",5,14,81,14 February 2009
Superbad," Bad good, and Bad BAD!
","Superbad manages to be both enjoyable and touching, and not in the creepy-uncle sort of way, either. If you can stomach the 186 instances of the f-word - and I'm sure most of you can - you'll never stop laughing. It's hysterical. I'm not going to put it on the level of classics such as Airplane! or Young Frankenstein, but coming from a thirtysomething who's not the intended audience, it's badass in its funniosity. It's a movie in which high school seniors talk like high school seniors and act like high school seniors, not a movie like Porky's, in which guys with receding hairlines pretended they hadn't yet grown pubic hair.First things first - I'm changing my name to McLovin, because it's THAT hardcore. When chicks hear my name, they may give me an askance look, but they're really thinking, 'Hm, that is so hawt.' I know this because Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) wound up scoring, sort of, on the basis of his new name. That's right, pushed-up glasses, dorky haircut, stammering, it all means diddly if you have one and only one name. Why else did Madonna get so much action back in the day? Or Jackee'? Or Cher. Or Fabio. Yes, I'll be the thirtysomething, Dilbert-like Fabio. Chicks dig that.Fantasy aside, here's the basic plot. Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are longtime buds who are nearing the end of their high school existence. They expected to go to college together as well, but it turned out that Evan was hella smarter than Seth, so although the former got into Dartmouth, the latter could do no better than a state college. Moreover, it's the standard end-of-school party time! Seth wants desperately to hook up with Jules, who's hosting the party. To get into her good graces, he tells her that he and Evan will supply the shindig with booze. (Everyone's underage, in case that wasn't clear.) Meanwhile, Evan has the hots for Becca, whom he respects - Evan's one of those quiet, sensitive types, always tripping over himself not to be impolite while being awkward. The boys now have a quest - use Fogel's newfound fake ID - he's suddenly a 25-year-old Hawaiian named McLovin! - to buy a metric crapload of liquor for the party.As with Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, everything goes wrong. Fogel's separated from Evan and Seth when the liquor store is robbed, and the other two wind up at a soirée where, among other things, Seth winds up with a nasty liquid on his pants. Plus there are two ribald, hell-raising cops who smoke, drink, shoot their guns in the air - on duty. Aw, yeah. 'Can I shoot one?' asks Fogel. 'I don't know,' replies Officer Michaels, 'can you?' On one level, this is pure raunch, with sex and cursing (and even some mild drug use). Lots of sex references that might squick you out if you're of a certain age and can't handle teens even thinking about fornication. (You probably haven't read this far, then, bailing when the 'f-word' term was used earlier.) But even so, the profanity seems somehow natural, almost organic - this is how kids talk. Not all, surely, but some portion. It's not as if they're all being presented as child prodigies who harbor mean streaks, they're merely acting as typical teens might.On another level, though, there is deep meaning in the relationship between Evan and Seth, two friends who have grown to be completely dependent on each other over the years, so much so that they're in denial about their future - Evan will be rooming with Fogel at Dartmouth, a fact he's kept from Seth. Seth is arrogant, loud, obnoxious, and not particularly bright or gallant, and Evan is his polar opposite in nearly everything. Neither one exudes machismo or toughness, although Seth puts up a good front. Their sweet, platonic relationship comes off as sincere to its very core. This is not a cheap dichotomy thrown together for laughs; you get the feeling Seth and Evan really care for each other and that each feels he'd be hopelessly lost without the other. It's a bittersweet feeling.But that's all below the surface. Revel instead on the entertaining performances by the bombastic Hill and the reserved Cera - these guys act as if they've known each other all their lives, the chemistry's so good. Also no slouch is the inimitable Mintz-Plasse, who's a bit like DJ Qualls' character in Road Trip: geeky and yet appealing as all get out.",8,0,5,25 August 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Idiotic, but things do blow up
","Despite the great efforts of Hugh Jackman, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is dead on arrival, combining an illogical plot with a raft of clichés that would embarrass the worst porn writer ever. There are too many characters to keep track of, and the action seems to be intentionally frantic, the better to distract you from the fact that little of the story makes a whit of sense.We get to see the actual origins of Wolverine (that is, as a young child) when he discovers that the man he just killed with his bare, uh, claws was his real dad and that the guy he thought was just a good pal is actually his brother Victor, aka Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). Later we see Wolverine (known then as Logan) and Sabretooth fighting in four different American wars (Civil, WWI, WWII, and Vietnam), and then he and his brother are eventually brought in as part of a mutant team called Weapon X by a sinister military guy, Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston). The mutants proceed to kick everyone's ass until Wolverine has a bout with decency and quits.Fast forward six years later and Wolverine's living a placid life as a lumberjack in Canada with his hot girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox, and Stryker finds him and tells him someone's picking off the old team members (oh no!). Can Wolverine help? Who's responsible for these deaths? I bet Stryker knows more than he's telling. He's sinister, you know.If I had to sum up this movie's plot in one word, it'd be 'revenge.' Wolverine is constantly avenging someone or something. Sometimes he's just mad in general, but usually he's going after Sabretooth for something or going after Stryker for something or going after unnamed goons in helicopters and tanks for something. Another recurring motif is Wolverine's angst. The guy's like 140 years old, but he has the angst of a cuckolded teenager on prom night. At least twice he looks up to the heavens, arms spread, crying 'NOOOOOOOOOOO!' Yes, in this day and age of highfalutin gizmodery we still have mopey superheroes.The movie tries so damn hard to be loved that it forgets it's supposed to be sort of a superhero comic-book movie. There's endless backstory about the two brothers, and it feels like it's shoehorned in, almost as if the makers thought they had to explain themselves. Is it important to know that Wolverine's dad was a gardener? Probably not. Did he have to visit so many of the former members of Weapon X? I'm gonna say no.Even so, the final villain – Deadpool, who has all the strengths of the other mutants on the team and none of their weaknesses – is pretty damn scary and convincing. Trouble is, they make him so tough to kill that it's difficult to get closure on him. If you know what I mean. I mean, he has all of the strengths of these superhuman dudes without having those namby-pamby weaknesses! What's the point? At least the setting's appropriate for this movie: Three Mile Island, which for you youngsters out there we should note was the scene of a major nuclear-power-plant accident in 1979, which might be when this movie's denouement is set.Anyway, because there's so much exposition, there's little room for character – either character development or an actual character OF the film. It's bland, the porridge of comic-book movies. There's no cleverness, no wit, nothing more than snide asides and bon mots, as if we were in a faceless Stallone movie circa 1984. Jackman's game, of course, but he's now played Wolverine in four movies, so this wasn't exactly a stretch for him. I'd like to think that this clunker will put to rest any plans for future Origins installments, but I got a feeling we'll be seeing Magneto and Storm get their tales told someday as well.",5,3,4,3 December 2009
That Thing You Do!," A simple fable from simpler times
","Oh sure, we've all seen what this movie's about - the rise of a All-American musical group in the early sixties. And it's chock full of the kind of fellas you'd expect to see in a band, too: the shy one, the wild one, the cute one, the smart one. Obviously these kids are patterned after the Beatles, and Tom Hanks wisely wrote into this one the fact that the ascension of the band takes place shortly after the Beatles' own climb.
Overall, there's not a whole lot that's out of the ordinary for this movie. There have been countless movies about music groups or solo artists who achieved success (some against horrible odds), only to crash and burn after a short stay at the top. Some are based on fact, some are fabricated by the always-creative (!) minds of Hollywood. And this movie's not all that different. It's fairly predictable from start to finish, but what might set this apart from all the others is its undying charm. There's not an unappealing performance to be seen, including Hanks himself (and he directed, too, so if you don't like it, you know who to blame). Each of the young actors involved is very engaging, especially Tom Everett Scott as Guy, and Liv Tyler as Faye. There's not a false note in the entire movie, and these kids really light up the screen both with their musical performance and their unerring acting. It's a solid directorial debut for Hanks (if you don't include an episode of 'From the Earth to the Moon' for HBO).",6,4,4,23 February 2000
Hot Fuzz," Simon Peggs a Fuzzy role
","Some might say that if you liked Shaun of the Dead, you'll like Hot Fuzz, since they have the same director, writer, and stars (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). But while Shaun was a more-or-less tongue-in-cheeky-cheek look at zombie movies, Fuzz is a little more straightforward, going for an action-comedy vibe rather than a horror-comedy vibe. This isn't to say Hot Fuzz fails to meet expectations, it's just that you sort of have to make sure your expectations are calibrated efficiently.Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a straight-arrow London bobby who is extremely good at his job. Crime declines considerably when he's on the beat, much to the dismay of his superiors, who feel he's making the rest of them look bad. As a punishment for his good deeds, Angel is transferred to the hinterlands of England, specifically a small village called Sandford, where he proceeds to lock up half the town in his first night on such reckless crimes as underage drinking and urinating in public. Oops, turns out the criminal of the second crime is his new partner - cue wacky soundtrack - who's also the son (Frost) of the police chief (Jim Broadbent). Off to a bad start already, Angel is chagrined to learn that the police force in the sleepy town doesn't really care a lot about crimestopping, instead electing to eat, drink, loaf, that sort of thing. Then people start to die in mysterious and gruesome ways, and only Angel believes they're all connected. The deaths, not the people themselves, although that's also possible. He smells a conspiracy, is what I'm trying to say here. But no one believes him - cue wacky soundtrack again.Now, this might have come off as a one-note, dumb action movie if it weren't for the grim determination of Pegg to essay a character of some depth. He's not simply a righteous cop out to save the world, he's a nice guy who has ultimate respect for the law and is devastated when others don't. Pegg's performance is perfectly sincere, and although he seems unassuming and even vague - witness his Shaun of the Dead - he is commanding, taciturn, and an utter delight as the seemingly humorless, single-minded cop. He's fantastic, and because his character is so emotionless, the other actors by contrast seem even funnier, particularly Frost as a doofus who'd love to be more than what he is, if only there weren't so much work involved. Broadbent, Stuart Wilson, Paddy Considine, and a wolfish Timothy Dalton round out a pitch-perfect cast.Hot Fuzz is splendid, a genial change from Shaun of the Dead, as it maintains all the soul and equilibrium of that minor classic without feeling stodgy, stilted, or dull. Pegg in particular - good thing, since he's the lead - manages to elevate the proceedings magnificently. Oh, and watch for Peter Jackson and Cate Blanchett in cameos (hint: it'll be tough to spot Blanchett).",8,0,1,14 August 2007
Constantine," Moody, vivid occultothriller; Reeves does a fine job
","John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) can see things, you know. Demons, angels, stuff like that. Oddly enough, though, people believe he can - mostly because he moonlights as an exorcist, trapping demons - who shall not stay in his plane! - in mirrors and smashing them to teeny bits. World weary and constantly sucking on a coffin nail, Constantine is beleaguered and burned out, a noir detective for the afterlife, if you will. But he's alive; he's just cursed with the gift of seeing demons and angels. And he's a suicide, having been clinically dead for two minutes once upon a time, a time during which he literally saw Hell.Cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) just lost her sister, a patient who jumped off the top of a mental hospital; Angela thinks her sister also Saw Something, and so she goes to John for help. Did Isabel know something? Where is she now? Can Angela see, too? Well, she can, actually, because Isabel was her twin sister, and as we all know twins share everything. So, using Angela, Constantine learns that the Bad Guys (demons), who are supposed to stay in Hell, have been crossing over to the plane of the living, presumably to raise hell. But Constnatine knows there's something else afoot, something only witchcraft, voodoo, and other otherworldly things can uncover.If there was ever a role that the adult Reeves was born to play (besides that of Neo), it's that of John Constantine. Constantine wanders hither and yon, doing good deeds and helping with crimes involving the occult, and so forth, all with a resigned and - pardon another pun - rather soulless attitude. Constantine knows he's doomed to a lifetime of doing this, partly because he tried to kill himself and partly because he has The Gift. It's this kind of dispassionate nihilism that plays perfectly to Reeves' own dull, emotionless acting range. He's perfect for the role, based on a comic book called Hellblazer.Weisz is pretty good - believable, at least - as the clumsily named Angela, but the real standout among the supporting cast is Peter Stormare as Satan himself. Incredibly creepy; he looks like a kindergarten teacher but behaves like a pedophile. The hair on the back of your neck will rise when Stormare enters the picture about three-fourths through.Two other things the movie has going for it are a rather simplistic plot and some fantastic special effects (for example, a demon made up of bugs). Movies based on comic books tend to overburden themselves and the viewer with far too many plot twists. It's not tough - you have a good guy, you have a bad guy, and the first must defeat the second. Throw in some ethical and moral conflicts, give the good guy a power of sorts, and you're off and running. Constantine does this pretty well.The atmosphere of the film is riveting as well, with effects special and otherwise transporting the viewer to Right There, whether it's a voodoo bar, Hell, or the mean streets of the city.If you watch the movie with the idea that it's a filmed comic book, you shouldn't be dissatisfied with the result. John Constantine lives in a world in which he sees unspeakable evil on a daily basis, and he himself has literally been to Hell and back on more than one occasion. His lot is to suffer for his sin; can he find redemption in a cutie named Angela?",8,7,10,2 August 2005
The Others," They're creepy and they're spooky....
","Seems like when folks talk about the good old days of movies, they talk about movies that made you think, movies that scared you not by showing you something scary but by not showing you something at all. The fear of the unknown, conventional wisdom holds, is the ultimate fear. We do not fear the dark because it is dark; we fear it because of what it masks.The Others harkens back to those oldtime scary movies, a haunted house movie that answers some questions, invites many more, and always keeps you on the very cusp of collapsing into hysterics. It's not just a neat ghost story told well; it's practically dripping with atmosphere.Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) lives in a gigantic old mansion with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, waiting for her husband to return from World War II. The kids have developed a sort of photosensitivity disease, and cannot be exposed to any light more than that of a candlelight. This leads to the house being shrouded in darkness much of the time, and Grace even goes so far as to direct that no door may be opened without the previous door being closed, so as to prevent extra light from shining on the children.Grace hires a troika of housekeepers and handyman to help around the house and with the kids, but the three older people seem... well, a little off to her. And soon the Stewarts come to believe they are not at all alone in the expansive manse, as daughter Anne insists she has seen and spoken to a little boy named Victor.Who's behind the spectre appearances? Is it the hired help? Are the kids fibbing to their stern mother? Or is it all in the mind of Grace herself? Adding to the confusion is the return of Mr. Stewart to the house - like the help, he seems more than a little bit off-center. What is going on?The mood is positively eerie, and it's accomplished by a pronounced lack of musical accompaniment. In most horror movies, one hears a melodramatic chord or two, leading up to the victim being slaughtered. Not in The Others. Silence is deadly and heightens the tension and suspense immeasurably.
This is probably Kidman's finest work, and in my mind it mostly erases the painful memory of watching her attempt to act in Eyes Wide Shut. Stripped of the baggage known as Tom Cruise, Kidman is simply superb, mesmerizing the viewer to the point of feeling a deep empathy for her plight. The plot's no slouch, either, full of twists, including an incredible denouement. As ghost stories go, The Others is one of the best I've ever seen.",8,0,0,28 May 2002
Brokeback Mountain," Dreadful, and a disgrace to taboos
","The story of a long-time romantic relationship between two cowboys should, in a perfect world, be a beautiful tale. It should show that despite the taboo of same-sex relationships, love and compassion can reign supreme. Instead, we're stuck with a deadeningly dull piece of slop that would put any sentimentalist to sleep if there weren't so many goshdarn panoramic views of mountains.Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) are itinerant cowpokes who sign up to herd a mess o' sheep across Brokeback Mountains, and during the long drive, they fall for each other. Only it doesn't happen gradually, it's lust at first sight, after a cold night in a hot tent up in the mountains. After that, it's decades of pining and not immediately getting what one wants.I honestly believe that this movie has been such a big hit (critically and commercially) because of its same-sex theme, rather than because of its, oh I don't know, good acting or script. The plot is exceedingly simplistic; it's so easy to follow, you'll be able to predict the next scene with ease. But because the two principals are men, suddenly what's such a humdrum story ascends to an exalted level of genius.Make no mistake, it's a pretty picture to look at, and I do recommend watching it with the sound off. Maybe you love lovely scenery - there's a lot of gorgeous setting. Or maybe you're a straight woman or gay man and think Ledger and Gyllenhaal are hot hunks. With no sound, you'll be very happy. Turn the sound on, though, and you'll quickly realize there's no there, there. The problem with being a Beautiful Person on the outside, of course, is that people often assume you're a dullard inside. When Ennis or Jack speaks, there aren't pearls of wisdom that come dropping out; no, they're more like balls of silt, spoken either sotto voce or outright mumbled, the better to fame the words as Profound. There's nothing profound about the movie, other than the vast infinity of the untamed mountains.The movie perks up only when other actors show up. Randy Quaid has a few short scenes, and he easily outacts the younger leads. Michelle Williams, who plays Ennis's wife Alma, and Anne Hathaway, who plays Jack's wife Lureen, light up the screen when they're there, showing more vigor and passion with the hook of an eyebrow than either of the lunkheaded leads can with every expressionless countenance they can conjur. Ledger, who seemed to be channeling Steve McQueen's look, mumbles incoherently through much of the movie; this was partly owing to the chaw in his mouth (I presume), but still - when trying to be Profound, it is wise to be Understandable.I believe that this movie was swept up in hype, as people were first astonished at the man-on-man sex scenes (which looked and sounded as loving as a rape scene, although I'm no expert on gay sex scenes) and then proud of themselves for deigning to watch it. It's a real shame a taboo like this couldn't have been broken by a solid, adult film instead of the crappy, one-dimensional clichés and characterizations that screenwriter Larry McMurtry came up with; somehow, in the world of this movie, laconic equals deep.",2,15,40,17 February 2006
Insomnia," Sleepy-eyed Pacino well met
","Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is a Los Angeles cop who is sent along with his partner to a rural Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a young girl. While chasing a possible suspect, however, Dormer accidentally shoots his partner, with whom he had had a recent argument, in a dense fog.  Rather than admit his own guilt, though, Dormer tries a coverup, thinking that no one could know what really happened. But someone did see - the man Dormer and his partner were chasing.What follows is a taut cat-and-mouse game. Walter Finch (Robin Williams) knows what really happened in the murky fog, and he'd like to help Dormer cover it all up - but for a price. And in addition, the shooting of Dormer's partner is also being investigated, separately, by a novice detective named Ellie (Hillary Swank), who idolizes the veteran cop. Something's got to give - Ellie's a great young mind, and it'll only be a matter of time before she figures it out, right?Every movie, save for the mindless, faceless action films, must have some kind of hook for the audience, something to make it unique. In this case, it's the fact that Williams is playing a bad guy - an atypical role. And it's a great role for him, too, as he does a fine job getting to the meat of the character. Pacino's got a good character to play as well - think Serpico - and he's at his best while underplaying thinking man's roles (okay, I'm not forgetting his younger, wilder days as Michael Corleone, but his best work as a pure actor are with these roles). Add in the beautiful Alaska scenery and the fact that it's light out for much, much longer periods than it is for those of us in the continental U.S., and you have quite the setting for a modern film noir, so to speak.The title comes from the fact that Dormer simply can't sleep after he's accidentally (or was it an accident?) shot his partner. He's haunted by images of his dying partner; racked with self-doubt, he also has trouble sleeping because of the endless light in Alaska, resorting to taping his shades closed and placing objects in front of the window to make it darker. And because of his inability to sleep, he becomes very strung out, unable to think clearly.This movie is from the director of Memento, which was a fascinating film noir in its own right, expertly written and directed. Because Memento was so good, I did have higher hopes for Insomnia. Insomnia isn't nearly as good as Memento, but it's still a very well done, intriguing psychological thriller with an excellent cast.",7,0,1,7 June 2002
Aquaman," A B for effort
","The origin story of Aquaman was...dramatic pause...lukewarm. No? Flat? Tepid? Too reliant on computer-driven effects? Lacking in logic? Overlong? My bottom line is that it was a fine movie, one that doesn't hinder DC's continuing effort to make movies. It does feature some strong performances (Momoa, Heard, Kidman, Wilson), but there's way too many myths and legends crammed in. In fact, there were times when I felt like I was watching an Indiana Jones movie than a superhero movie. There were more Maguffins in this movie than there were human actors. Also, while one certainly must suspend one's disbelief for these movies, it's counterintuitive to proclaim certain rules for a new (to the audience) setting and then either ignore those rules or break them outright. It's also not a good idea for a hero or heroine to forget they have certain abilities until the plot says it's time to wrap up the scene And let's try to ignore the cliches, while we're at it. But, all in all, I'll give it a B for effort.",6,0,0,12 February 2019
Juno," Juno? I think you do.
","Juno is instantly charming, witty, and just plain a lot of fun to watch. You wouldn't think a movie about teen pregnancy would be much of a hoot, as the topic generally lends itself best to movie-of-the-week weepers and movies with a moral message. Juno has no message, really, other than perhaps 'It's okay to be different' and 'Love is sometimes found right under your nose.' It's not steeped in raunchy behavior; instead, it's sweetly charming, almost daring you to find fault with it.Juno (Ellen Page) is a self-assured sixteen-year-old junior in high school, and she's just learned - after taking three home pregnancy tests - that she's in the family way. Juno is your slightly atypical caustic, sarcastic teen who takes issue with everything that society offers. To her, being popular is tantamount to being covered in hives. She's into old-school punk rock, not old-school grunge or boy-band music. She's a rebel without a cause, coping with her individuality by virtue of her quick wit and quicker tongue.Juno knows who the father is - it's wiry Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of Superbad). The question of whether Paulie and Juno love each other doesn't even come up; even they know enough to know that their relationship isn't at that level.After some soul searching, Juno decides she wants to have the baby and then give it up for adoption. She and her best friend Leah find an ad in the Pennysaver, which leads Juno to the house of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), a thirtyish couple that desperately wants to have a baby.But again, this is no movie of the week. There's no teary confrontation between mother-to-be and mother-wannabe; there's no tone of Great Importance about how adoption would be Right for the unborn child. The situation is what it is, and it's played for tender laughs. Juno herself says that all she wants to do is pop the baby out and hand it over - but we adults in the audience know there's always a chance that when she does give birth, she'll experience remorse and reneg on the deal. We know it might happen, because we've all seen the similar true-life stories.Juno, though, immediately takes a liking to the couple, so she plows wholeheartedly forward with the deal: she gives birth, and they get the child. Easy peasy.Supporting Juno in her decisions are her taciturn dad (J. K. Simmons) and stepmom Bren (Allison Janney), both of whom alternate between offering advice and acting exasperated at Juno's latest exploits (in a memorable early scene, Juno recreates the room where the conception took place - outside Paulie's front door). For those of you who know Simmons through his role as Spider-Man's nemesis J. Jonah Jameson, you might be surprised at how tender and loving - although still gruff - Simmons can be. He's a lot like Harry Dean Stanton in Pretty in Pink; he obviously cares very much for his daughter and wants badly to help her, but he's out of his depth as far as pregnancies go.And at the center of everything is the truly remarkable Ellen Page, a twenty-year-old petite Canadian who wins the audience over with her first appearance. As Juno, Ellen is unique, a girl dancing to the beat of her own different drummer, eschewing the rigid mores of society for a more enlightened, free-spirited outlook on life. Juno is not a delightful, happy-go-lucky girl; she's cynical, arch, and distrustful of popularity. But she's also sweet, honest, and loving, and not just any actress could be shoved into this movie like some cookie-cutter cutie from Central Casting. That's why Page's outstanding performance is such a treasure; she brings out the good and bad in Juno (which, ironically, is one of the 'messages' the movie has for us).Juno is not a low-brow comedy about impending birth. It does not involve a wacky obstetrician, and there are no panicking grandmothers-to-be. The difficulties that Juno faces along her journey to the delivery room are firmly rooted in reality, and they're difficulties that Juno faces with aplomb. There's hardly an insincere note in this delightful gem.",9,3,8,10 February 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," See it later ...
","The Day after Tomorrow is an appropriate title, really. It's the kind of movie you always want to watch the day after tomorrow, no matter what the day is.Okay, cheap joke. Always a good way to start a review, even if it's a joke that'll show up in most lukewarm reviews. Tornados in Los Angeles! A tidal wave in New York! Superduperquick frost!! Run! Get the kids, go to the basement! No, wait, it'll flood there. Go to the top floor! No, wait, the tornado will get you. Ahhh! Die!Seems that when Hollywood wants you to get killed, well then by gum you get killed, logic be damned. See, the polar ice caps are melting (perhaps you've read about this somewhere). According to paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), the fresh water from the melted caps was interfering with the salt water of the oceans (who knew?), causing desalinization, which in turn apparently causes every natural disaster known the man, even hurricanes that appear over land (hint: they usually appear over water).Hall's model claims this'll all happen over the next 100, 1000 years (he's not sure, of course), but during a conference in New Delhi the vice president of the United States heckles him from the audience. As in most disaster movies, this is foreshadowing; as soon as the mess happens (first in L.A., for a change), Jack tries to warn the veep about What Might Happen, and he's ignored. ('He tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen!') It's up to Jack to save the day!At the same time, Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is attending some kind of smart-kid trivia contest in New York. When the tidal wave hits the city, Sam and his gang (including the One Nerd in his group, the Girl of Sam's Dreams; and the Cad Who Might Steal Her Away from Sam) are pretty much stranded. At first, they attempt to get back to home to Washington, but a last-second phone call to Jack convinces Sam to stick it out in the New York Public Library.The dichotomy between father and son isn't subtle. Sam's a bit of a rebel, having received a failing grade in a class for not showing his work, and Jack's always rebelling against his bosses at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At the library, Sam decides to walk across the giant ice floe that's developed in Manhattan to a Russian tanker that's somehow made its way into town. (Don't ask.) Back in D.C., Jack decides to fulfill a promise he'd made to his son (look! More foreshadowing!) and trek to New York to get his son. There are two instances of 'No! I can't let you go alone!' as Jack's comrades in science and Sam's friends help out.At any rate, Jack's eventually called in to brief the president and the Joint Chiefs. Of course, why wouldn't he be? He's obviously the only scientist in the world who said global warming would be the end of us all. During the briefing, he outlines the bad news, that in about 7-10 days the face of the globe would be changed forever. Jack's a real downer, isn't he? Someone in the room asks him what his plan is, which is funny - I thought that was THEIR job. But that's what they do in these disaster movies; they ask the scientist what he thinks should be done, and then they ignore him. But this time, they don't. Probably because by that time New York was 100 feet under water and snow, and Los Angeles was demolished by three twisters. So what's Jack's plan? Evacuation. Get this - he draws a line on a map, cutting the United States in half widthwise. All of the states below the line should be evacuated; those above it, Jack says, are already lost. It's too late to save him, he claims. The southern states should go to Mexico.Bearing in mind that the science in this movie is already highly suspect, one must also realize that emigrating to Mexico is a pretty dumb idea. Why there? If the frosty badness is going to hit, say, Texas, why would it stop at the Rio Grande? The entire southwest U.S. seemed to be as safe as Mexico, and yet the president orders everyone to go there (which led to some laughter in the audience - U.S. citizens charging en masse across to border TO Mexico?). Only after the U.S. forgives a ton of third-world debt are we allowed to overrun Mexico. Which only seems fair. (Note to third-world countries! Hope for a massive disaster to befall us so your debt will be forgiven!)(As an aside, here's a drinking game for you to try when this comes out on video. Every time someone says, 'My God!' or some variant, chug some vodka.)The special effects weren't bad, but they weren't nearly as convincing as they should have been, given that there was no real character development, a simple plot, and an atmosphere that failed to get me to care about any of the participants (although it did try). The tornados looked real, and so did the tidal wave (to an extent), but the timberwolves that fortuitously show up about halfway through didn't look at all real - perhaps because they weren't. They were computer generated.The entire tone of the movie was off a little, too. Imagine this in real life. Tens of millions of people are going to die. Sure, you'd be concerned about your own skin, but you wouldn't likely forget that this was going to affect so many people. This movie, however, makes the imminent deaths of all of the offscreen people nothing more than background noise. There's obvious mass bloodshed here, but no one seems to bat an eye.There are also superfluous characters and story threads, which is fine if you're in the middle of a four-night blockbuster miniseries. It's not fine when you have to cram everything into two hours or so. Shedding some characters would have helped immensely. Through it all, Dennis Quaid as Jack is very strong, perhaps the best work he's done in years. He didn't have much to work with, but I think he did a great, soulful performance. (I say 'soulful' because I don't think the director has one, and the performances of most of the cast leads me to doubt theirs as well.) Gyllenhaal is his equal as Sam, perhaps making up for his awful performance in October Sky. But most of the cast is just there, taking up space. One other notable mention, though; Ian Holm as Dr. Rapson, the scientist in Scotland who alerts Jack to the impending doom is outstanding, leagues better than the material.One of the aspects of a disaster film that make it satisfying to moviegoers is that it has a palatable ending. Your ship sank? Well, at least some people survived and can simply pick up the pieces of their broken life, or at least hum the melody to a sad country song. But not the ostensible survivors of this movie, no. See, these natural disasters are supposedly the harbingers of another ice age. Yeah, you got it. They have to deal with this crap for 10,000 years.The Day after Tomorrow is mediocre, with poor plotting, vacant characterizations, and mostly crummy special effects. It has some unintentionally hilarious moments, but overall it's a waste of time. Still, if you must see it, please see it on the big screen.",4,0,1,30 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Confusing junk - wait for director's cut?
","The third Pirates movie is a bloated carcass that seems to consist solely of people running (or sailing) from Action Scene to Action Scene, with only a convoluted plot to keep them afloat. It doesn't always work.Clocking in at 165 minutes, 'At World's End' contains several endings too many. 'Ah,' you think, 'that's the end!' and then more stuff happens, and you fall asleep. It's as if the producer (Jerry Bruckheimer, of course) looked at the clock, noticed that a mere two hours had elapsed, and ordered his writing minions to crank out more implausibles to stretch the running time for no apparent reason.So. Did I like the movie, you wonder? Well, I sat through nearly three hours of it, so I suppose I should find something positive to say. Things blew up, and that was awesome. Plus, I decided that Keira Knightley was far manlier than Orlando Bloom, who I'm told is actually a man. (No, seriously!) And that Johnny Depp wears mascara better than Knightley, who's apparently not a little boy.All kidding aside, the biggest problem with the movie is that it's overplotted. We make fun of dumb action movies that have minimal plot and are basically excuses for explosions, but here's the mirror image - there's so much going on that the typical viewer will be confused and disoriented. Which is good, I suppose, in that it'll distract him or her from the actual storyline problems.When we last left the Good Guys, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had been claimed by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and imprisoned in (believe it or not) Davy Jones' Locker. The resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) must rescue him. To do so, they have to team up with or defeat or betray Singapore's own legendary pirate, Sao Feng (the wonderful Chow Yun-Fat), as well as various Pirate Lords, the British navy, and so on.The biggest problem facing Barbossa is that the one force that can help him and the other Pirate Lords against the likes of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is that of an ancient goddess, who has been bound to a human body for years and years. Barbossa wants to unleash the goddess in hopes that she'll aid them all, but clear thinkers around him are more of the mind that she'll instead beat the snot out of them for imprisoning her in the first place. Of course, this being a loud action movie, there's no way in heck she's going to stay bound in a human body, right? Hilarity ensues.The cast is game, but typically wooden performances by Bloom and Knightley are countered by an equally typically nuanced and often hysterical one by Depp - not to mention a bombastic, scene-stealing turn by Rush. But plot oddities abound. Elizabeth seems awash in makeup that never, ever comes off or smudges in the teeniest, despite one protracted scene taking place in a torrential downpour. I also liked the time Elizabeth was ambushed by British soldiers, one of whom puts her in a headlock; when she recognizes one of the other soldiers, Elizabeth merely throws off her captor's arm and escapes. Why she didn't do this throughout the movie, when she was in constant peril or capture, is a mystery. Or how the entire British navy, upon seeing one of their own ships decimated by pirates, says, 'the hell with this,' and sails away.As I implied, though, the movie's murky plot is its ultimate downfall. Who's on whose side? You know going in that there will be treachery, but when a movie has every character essentially turning on every other character, the whole novelty of the doublecross is long since vanished. After a while, you come to expect someone doing someone else wrong, all the more so if those two characters sort of were on the same side at one point earlier in the series. Once you tune out important details like who's on which side, the movie's sort of lost its way.And here's more bad news. The conventional wisdom in Hollywood now is that franchise films should be three movies long, no more, that three's about the limit for the typical moviegoer. But the ending very strongly hints that there will be a fourth Pirates movie. This might wind up being wishful thinking on the part of Bruckenheimer and director Gore Verbinski (who have done all three movies), rather than reality, as the second and third movies were filmed simultaneously.All in all, this is a butt-numbing disappointment. If you gotta make it long, make it worth my while. If you're gonna have crap blow up, make it interesting. If you're gonna have double and triple crosses, make me care.",5,10,20,29 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spider Pig would have been a better choice
","Spider-Man 3 might be best subtitled, 'Peter Parker Grows a Pair.' That would seem like an endearing quality if this was a coming-of-age movie about the sand-in-the-face nerd finally overcoming bullies and low self-esteem to win the girl of his dreams, but it's not so wonderful or interesting in a superhero movie.Sure, Spidey DOES have low self-esteem, and sure, Peter Parker IS a nerdy little twit, but he's no weakling - that ship has long since sailed. Now, Spider-Man is the hero of children across the city, so there's less reason to empathize with him, to identify our own uncoolness within Parker.The problems with this movie are manifold. To begin with, the webslinger has far too many bad guys to face. First, there's the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict who fell into a particle accelerator and now has the properties of, well, sand. Then there's an alien parasite, conveniently falling from the sky so it can latch onto Peter and bring out the worst in his repressed personality. Then there's Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a supremely vicious rival photographer. Oh, and Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of the Green Goblin; he thinks Spidey killed his pop (he didn't), and he knows Peter is Spidey (oops). So you can imagine what's on Harry's mind.With all of these villains, you'd think there'd be plenty of conflict. Clearly, however, the writers felt something else was needed, so they invented a highly contrived plot thread in which Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) relationship disintegrates. It should be no surprise to you whatsoever that somehow this relationship gets resuscitated by movie's end. They're together! They're apart! They hate each other! They love each other! You'll hate them both! And what bugs me more than the obviousness, the sheer craptastic predictability of the relationship angle, is that both MJ and Peter act like completely selfish, rotten jerks to each other - and we're supposed to eat that up. Apparently, we're supposed to think, 'Hey, yeah, that's exactly how it is!' Supporters of the movie might point to the fact that Peter's under Venom's control when he's treating MJ like garbage, but that's not true - he's a creep to her well before Venom shows up. He's smug, self-centered, clearly soaking up the adoration of the city like he was Donald Trump handing out low-income housing in Brooklyn. Okay, maybe not that smug, but still. Peter Parker, in this movie, behaves exactly opposite from what makes Peter Parker interesting to the rest of us in the first place - that he is an insecure dweeb who happens to have superpowers. A crass, smarmy punk is not appealing.There's one telling scene - it was in the trailer, too - that shows Peter strutting down the street, wearing the Venom costume under his normal clothes, and every girl stops to stare at this supposed virile paragon of masculinity. Yeah, Peter Parker. The problem is that Tobey Maguire isn't much of an actor, and when he has to stray from the golly-gee innocent-lamb of Peter Parker, his inabilities are completely exposed. In short, he sucks ass. He can't carry a scene without putting on a mask and looking like he's swinging on some web-like substance. The casting of Maguire made sense originally, because he looks exactly like the kind of doofus nitwit you'd expect Peter Parker to be, but in this movie, when he has to be more than just that doofus, Maguire can't hack it.Speaking of looking like he's swinging .... isn't the whole purpose of CGI to make awesome things look real? Remember back in the day when actors would be in a car, appearing to drive through a city, when it was obvious they were on a set with the city scene playing in the background? I mean, on the cheaper films, it was pretty clear what was going on. The CGI in this movie is a lot like that. When Spider-Man is swinging between buildings, it looks like they took Maguire jumping around and plopped it onto a city background. It looks terrible, and it's distracting.So, let's recap. Too many villains (they should have stuck with Sandman and Harry), a shallow, ridiculous relationship, poor special effects, and bad acting, at least on Maguire's part. But hey, I can't blame him entirely - Sam Raimi's script turns Spider-Man into Emo Spidey - complete with stereotypical Goth haircut and dull monotone! And who knew that simply wearing the Venom costume could make one an accomplished jazz pianist and dancer? With all of these obvious inadequacies, you'd think that the door would finally be closed on this series, but since the movie did well, you can bet a S-M 4 will pollute the theaters sooner rather than later.",3,3,4,8 January 2008
Thor: Ragnarok," Delightful Marvel romp!
","Ragnarok, according to Norse mythology, is the destruction of the world. Armageddon! Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! In this movie, it's kind of like that, only it might also be a beginning. So zen. Whatever it means, Thor's third thrilling ride is a blast, with familiar and new characters zooming into view just long enough for us to pay a tiny bit of heed and move on. It's fast, not thickly plotted, and most importantly a lot of fun. More fun than The Dark World.Part of the reason is that Thor himself (Chris Hemsworth) smiles almost continuously throughout the movie. In previous Marvel films, Thor's been kind of serious, a more grounded counterweight to Tony Stark but not as angry as The Hulk. Here, he's both smart and giddy. And he has every reason to be giddy, because this is a fun movie, as so many Marvel films are.Thor returns to Asgard with the horns of some demon who's kind of important to the story, but he discovers that Heimdel (Idris Elba) has been accused of treason and is in exile, that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is using his powers of trickery to run things (including staging plays telling his tales of bravery), and that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is actually on Midgard (aka Earth). Oh, and that Odin's actual eldest child, Hela (Cate Blanchett) has now escaped her own prison – where Odin placed her when she got particularly rambunctious – and wishes to initiate Ragnarok. Death to everyone! Thor's adventures in trying to save Asgard land him on a remote planet, though, imprisoned to fight as a gladiator at the pleasure of the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), who's equal parts hilarious and brutal. And who's the grand champion in the arena? Why, none other than The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)! Can Thor escape the Grandmaster, get back to Asgard, stop Ragnarok, defeat his older sister, and then drink some mead? Some of those, anyway! So why does this Thor work so well? Because it's HILARIOUS. It's less comic-book movie and more comedy. There's a buttload of comedy, which is a lot no matter how big of a butt we're talking about. Everyone is aces. Even Stan Lee (yes, of course he has a cameo). Director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) essentially subverts the superhero film, taking on tropes, clichés, you name it. It's not that Thor acts like an anti-hero (like Iron Man), it's that he appears to have fun saving the universe. It's a nice switch. And Thor: Ragnarok gleefully (and gracefully) sets up the next movie(s) in the endless franchise, so it's a virtually seamless fit into the vaunted Marvel Universe.",8,1,5,16 November 2017
Match Point," Dreadful bore
","Match Point is Woody Allen's latest offering. The director of such gems as Manhattan, Annie Hall, Zelig, Bullets over Broadway, and Hannah and Her Sisters has been the king of the American art-house film for decades. Sometimes his movies are poignant, and sometimes they're slapstick hilarity. This offal, however, never even hints at Allen's writing or directing abilities; indeed, it may as well have been directed by John Badham for all of the flavor and panache it expresses.Even though the movie's appeared on many must-see lists as people gear up for the Oscar nominations, Match Point is a travesty of a sham of a mockery of an entertaining film. It's a longwinded load of dung. Nearly every scene is deadeningly dull, and the few that aren't are instead serve as perfect clichés.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris, a tennis pro who falls for Chloe, the daughter of a rich British family (the movie's set in London), played by Emily Mortimer. Chris' best pal is Tom (Matthew Goode), Chloe's sister. Rounding out the main quartet is American actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), who's engaged to Tom. Wouldn't you know it, seconds after meeting Nola - after already being partnered with Chloe - Chris falls for the flaxen-haired lass, who's strong-willed and outspoken where her British counterparts are a little more complacent.Can Chris keep his lust a secret from Tom and Chloe? And what of the parents, the richer-than-rich Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) and Alec (Brian Cox)? They dote on Chris, showering him with money and gifts and a job. How could Chris give all of that up to be with Nola? Several things work against the movie aside from the faceless direction and writing. For one thing, Chris is utterly unappealing. A protagonist certainly does not need to be likable, but there must be something about him or her that makes the audience want to see what happens to him or her. The appalling acting by Rhys-Meyers doesn't help matters at all; he's lifeless, utterly devoid of emotion. He can't even seem to conjure enough strength to show a good facial expression. He's a blank, a cipher no one wants to learn more about. Allen didn't write the character well at all, to make matters worse. It's a little too easy to figure out Chris' intentions, but his motivations are sometimes a mystery. And for goodness' sake, someone give this boy a spine transplant! How can a lead character be so terminally wishy washy? Of the supporting cast, only Johansson and Cox emerge unscathed. Cox is a veteran actor and could probably have played this role in his sleep, and Johansson is a rising star, capable of fantastic range. She was given very little to work with (her character doesn't really possess any unique traits), and it showed.The pacing is mind numbing. I cannot tell you how many times I checked my watch to see how much time remained in the movie. It's plodding and aimless, certain to bore even the most rabid Merchant-Ivory fan, even though those masters had nothing to do with this one. Instead, we're given the vagrant stepchild of a true master American filmmaker. Allen would have been much better off removing his name from the credits for the pseudonymous Alan Smithee. Another annoying debit: Despite the title, tennis takes place for maybe three scenes.If you're not a fanatic of tedious, overwrought melodramas, please adjust this rating down at least half a star.",1,8,16,18 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," Utterly charming, beautifully filmed romantic classic
","Of all the Woody Allen movies in all the art-house theaters in the world, this one is one of his truest, most engaging, most satisfying, and most existential. It's a gigantic treat to lovers of literature everywhere, but even if you don't know Toulouse-Lautrec from 2Pac, you should truly love either the tantalizing romantic angles or the mystery/fantasy underlying them all.Allen is getting too old to be playing himself in these movies, so the task falls to Owen Wilson (who doesn't have to change anything to do an Allen impression). Wilson plays Gil, a Hollywood writer engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), and they're tagging along with Inez's parents on their vacation to Paris. But while Inez is enamored with pretty, shiny objects and appearances, Gil instantly falls in love with the soul of Paris and wants nothing more than to wander its streets, particularly at night, to soak in its ambiance and perhaps get inspired to work on his burgeoning first novel. After all, such literary greats as Hemingway, Eliot, Fitzgerald, and Stein roamed those very streets; perhaps what they saw will help Gil.Now, the following is not a spoiler in least. A quick look at the list of characters should indicate a change in venue for Gil. One evening, a little drunk from a wine tasting, Gil sits on a church's steps; as the clock chimes midnight, an old car pulls up, exhorting him to come with them. Where? Why to the Fitzgeralds' of course. This leads Gil down quite the path of self-examination and inspiration.Along the way, Gil meets many of his literary heroes and discovers a little bit about what makes them tick. He's even able to make return visits by going to the same place at the same time. Of course, Inez doesn't believe him and is increasingly concerned with buying antique furniture with her bossy, snobby mother. The chasm between man and almost-wife widens.There are several reasons to recommend this movie. As usual, Allen's handpicked cast is up to its tasks. Some of these actors are known quantities to many people, but some are not; either way, they imbue their own characters with such a sense of reality that it's easy to imagine that actor truly is that icon. They deal not in caricatures but in realizations.Another huge plus is the way that the storyline is set up. On the one hand, you have the conflict between Inez and Gil, and on another you have his cathartic moments with his literary heroes. Along the way, Gil meets the Portugese Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a beauty who has inspired famous painters and who is in love with an earlier time – just as Gil is infatuated with his own earlier time. The moral that ties these two worlds and their inhabitants together is a simple one, and Allen delivers it with subtle grace and beauty.I have never been to Paris, a faraway land to me. But look at what Allen has done with the way the movie is shot. Paris is idyllic in the daytime, a combination of markets and boutiques, air-conditioned restaurants and street cafés. At night, the city comes alive, even in the rain; the movie is shot with such unerring detail and each raindrop seems a work of art symbolizing Gil's various quandaries.I think that Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's finest over the past 20 years, perhaps one of his best ever, and certainly I'm not saying so idly. The man has a long track record of delightful, funny comedies and romances. He knows his audience well. But here, I think he surpassed some expectations; his recent spate of Euro-centric movies (like Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Match Point) were fairly well received by most critics (ahem, not this one), but Midnight in Paris far exceeds them both – as well as just about anything Allen's done going back to the mid-1990s. It is a superlative film that's rich in texture, meaning, and elegance, and its ending is a little surprising but certainly plausible – the perfect ending.",9,4,7,25 September 2011
Zodiac," Look for crime thrillers - betcha pinch a Finch
","The true-crime thriller is one of the toughest kind of movies to make, because so many of the viewing audience will already be familiar with the storyline and can more easily anticipate what happens next. And the toughest true-crime thriller to make is probably one in which the culprit, in real life, was never caught. Then what do you do, hotshot? What do you do? If you're director David Fincher, you focus the plot not on the killings or on the resolution of the case but rather on the massive manhunt and intrepid detective work turned in by Inspectors David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) as well as the unofficial sleuthing by newspapermen Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). Thus humanizing the forces attempting to bring the Zodiac to justice, Fincher is able to not only tell the tale straightforwardly but also scare the bejezus out of his audience, as is his wont. By identifying with the four leads, the audience has no choice but to hope against hope - knowing what it knows of the real story - that somehow good will persevere.Of the four leads, the weak spot might be assumed to be the callow Gyllenhaal, but as it turns out he's easily the strongest link in a tough chain of thespians. Graysmith, on whose book the movie is based, doggedly pursued the case as the paper's cartoonist, much to the chagrin of those around him - his employers, his colleagues, and his wife (Chloe Sevigny) and kids. Graysmith MUST KNOW what happened. He wants to look Zodiac in the eye and somehow determine his culpability. Gyllenhaal - who should change his name to an easier to spell surname - is absolutely aces, which is a phrase I never thought I'd type regarding Jake Gyllenhaal. He's never impressed me, looking to have exactly one emotion - moroseness - and I've always thought he was far too highly rated, But here, young Jake has won me over, just as Josh Hartnett did with Lucky Number Slevin and Kate Winslet did with any number of films after the awful Titanic. Gyllenhaal is superb, believable, and sincere in a commanding performance.The others aren't slouches, of course. Downey, Jr., aping Al Pacino from Serpico - except not playing a burned-out cop, just a burned-out reporter - is appreciatively scuzzy as Avery, a man never too far from a dangling cigarette or a murky drop of alcohol. Ruffalo and Edwards (where's he been?) are a perfect match as two cops as desperate as Graysmith to find out the killer's identity, all the while trying to coordinate with other jurisdictions, the press, and the public. Ruffalo in particular is a treat to watch, and I'm not going on a limb when I say that someday that young man will have an Oscar nom to his credit.Fincher creates a edgy atmosphere throughout - you honestly believe Zodiac will leap out from any corner's shadows to knife or gun you down. He also achieves the tough task of showing the passage of time efficiently - by showing the construction of a San Francisco skyscraper in stop-motion. Nice touches like that can make a film. And of course, Fincher is no stranger to descending to the depths of ourselves, what with movies like Seven, Panic Room, and Fight Club to his credit. With Zodiac, he's managed to take a riveting story and make it even more compelling - even without a compelling ending in real life.",9,0,1,22 August 2007
Milk," Fresh and moving, if not wholesome, Milk
","Daring but not over the top, Gus Van Sant’s ode to the fallen gay-rights activist Harvey Milk is compelling, moving, and elegaic, successfully melding the hope of Milk’s drive for equal rights for homosexuals with his tragic death. Van Sant’s masterpiece, certain to be noticed around Oscar time, is poignant enough to mist even the most hardened of souls while remaining frighteningly relevant even thirty years after Milk’s murder.To be fair, writer Dustin Lance Black had wonderful source material from which to derive his screenplay, as Milk’s life was anything but placid, but he was able to tell his tale without getting sappy or maudlin, without the film’s devolution into a whitewash. But although Black’s screenplay is par excellence, this is Sean Penn’s show. Penn has grown so much as an actor, even though most film critics still note his seminal Jeff Spicoli performance from 1982’s Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Here, he disappears into the role of Harvey Milk, adapting some stereotypical - but not unheard of - mannerisms of gay men, but never going over the top, never coming close to lampooning his own subject. Penn’s grip on Milk’s inner psyche is devastatingly raw; he shows how much Milk cared about equality for all, even at the expense of life with his lover, Scott Smith (a pensive James Franco). This is a canard seen in many biopics, but here Penn’s Milk is not unaffected by how he affects others; he is not single minded, he is merely driven.Even though he has comparatively little screen time, Josh Brolin is Penn’s equal as Milk’s twisted - and also quite conflicted - fellow city supervisor, Dan White. Since this is a biographical movie, it’s not spoiling things to tell you that White is heavily involved in Milk’s murder, but at no point does Brolin make you think he’s just a hardheaded antigay jackass who’s out to bust anyone who’s not white and “normal.” But it’s not important how Milk dies, because the focus here is his life’s work and how it affected not only the gay community - in San Francisco and nationwide - but also the straights, particularly singer Anita Bryant, who got it into her pretty little head in the mid-1970s that God hates gays, and therefore gays shouldn’t get any rights at all. Her crusading begins in Florida, where she was once a popular orange-juice pitchwoman, and leads all the way to Milk’s backyard.Set against the backdrop of the turbulence that gestated in the late 1960s and grew to angry fruition in the 1970s, Milk captures the feel of the period, sans sanctimony and hand wringing. Penn’s work here should notch him his fifth Oscar nomination, perhaps even his second win; Van Sant should also get his second nomination as well. There really isn’t much negative to say about Milk, unless you’re bigot who’s ashamed of how well Milk makes the case for equal rights for everyone.",9,3,7,3 December 2008
The Prestige," Not terribly mysterious; too many twists
","The prestige, we're told, is the third and final part of a magic act, the one in which the twists and turns occur, the denouement of the act. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Apparently magicians analyze and study their craft endlessly, trying to improve, compete, excel, and dominate. The Prestige is about two lifelong competing magicians in 1900s London who are constantly trying to discover each other's secrets. Eventually, as they top each other, there's death, perhaps murder, placing everyone they know in mortal danger.Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is the showman, the magician with a flair for the dramatic. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is the moody technician with the creativity and intelligence to pull off the most remarkable stunts. They would seem to be fine complements for each other, but each is so set on beating the other that all pretense of camaraderie is abandoned.What follows, of course, is a couple hours of twists and turns, with so and so turning out to not be what he or she was purported to be. One of Angier's tricks goes horribly awry, and Borden is blamed for the result and is jailed. Is he guilty? How did he accomplish it? Linking the two masters is the aged Cutter (Michael Caine), who's been training them both since they were just starting out. A veteran of the gritty, no-holds-barred magic world, Cutter Knows Things. With a glint in his eye and a crusty grin, he reminded me more of Long John Silver, except without the eye path or the walking stick. Nothing like a crusty ol' sage to keep everyone in check, right? The heart of the animosity between Angier and Borden is that it's thought that Borden somehow was responsible for the death of Angier's wife during their act. Then Borden goes on to fame and fortune while Angier has nothing. Even Borden's tricks kick the ass of Angier's tricks, so much so that the latter journeys to, of all places, Boulder, Colorado in the United States to seek out Nicholas Tesla (well played by David Bowie), who'd built a funky device for Borden to use in his own act. All that's missing is Angier shouting, 'Vengeance will be mine!' Enter Olivia (Scarlett Johansson), a trollop/assistant who joins Angier's act. They fall in love, surprisingly. (That sentence brought to you by the word 'sarcasm.') Meanwhile, Borden falls in love with HIS assistant and knocks her up. So it's sort of like real life.Perhaps where the movie really lost me is in its science - one must suspend quite a bit of disbelief in order for key parts of the film to be acceptable. That's one of the risks of a story about magic; modern audiences know a lot more about science than did those at the turn of the last century, so there'd be much more skepticism. If Angier's trick were shown today, people would have myriad guesses as to what really happened, whereas in the 1900s it was all magic and wonder and crap like that. Still and all, the way in which Angier accomplishes his trick seems like a shaggy dog - it's in the story merely to move the plot along.I like movies with twists and turns, but when there are so many of them I no longer know what's right and what's wrong, I kind of lost interest in the movie. I hate not knowing which way is up, because when the credibility of each character - and, by extension, their own reality - is called into question, then the viewer has nothing to go by, and truly Anything can happen. Which makes me wonder what the point really is.On the plus side, you have the subtext of Batman (Bale) versus Wolverine (Jackman). Even Alfred from Batman is there (Caine). And both actors are pretty good, but the movie plods along in places. I've never really liked Bale, though, who has a giant head.See The Illusionist instead, a movie covering some of the same ground but more effectively and believably, with scarce, credible turns.",6,1,5,19 March 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Smash followup kicks butt
","I think Hellboy 2 supersedes the high standard set by Hellboy the First. I never read the comic books, didn’t know anything about Hellboy, didn’t know where he was from, what he was, anything, and the movie addressed all that for me. But after the backstory’s been told, the audience craves something exciting, a tale that makes sense and doesn’t run counter to what they know about the characters.In Hellboy 2, the Bureau gets a new, er, bureaucrat to replace Dr. Broom (John Hurt, seen in a flashback). Johann Krauss is a disembodied ectoplasmic spirit housed in a diving apparatus. (No, really.) He’s German, so that means he’s rigid and regimental and does things By the Book. I wonder how Hellboy will react to this? The dynamics of the Bureau’s top agents are as muddled as ever. Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and Liz (Selma Blair) are together, but kind of snapping at each other, as if they were a married couple, or something. He’s a lazy slob, she’s a nag, etc. Luckily, Blair and Perlman are both aces here, and they work very well together. Then there’s Abe Sapien, the alien who sounds an awful lot like C-3PO; he’s the brains to Hellboy’s brawn. So really the team is functionally dysfunctional, or something.The antagonist here is an exiled evil prince who’s trying to revive the Golden Army, a large group of robot monsters that simply cannot be stopped. All he needs is all three parts of an ancient crown, and the world will be his! AHAHAHAHAHAA. The prince looks a lot like Lucius Malfoy, but he’s got the mad ninja skills of a Jackie Chan, so he’s a formidable opponent. He’s also helped by a giant golem, which means we’re sure to see at least two epic battles between Hellboy and Some Bad Guy, causing a boatload of damage to New York City. Along the way, the Bureau’s outed, much to Krauss’s chagrin and to Hellboy’s delight. Tough to be a covert paranormal investigative unit when your pictures are all over the news.Perlman is an excellent Hellboy - sarcastic, cigar-chomping, fun-loving, and full of crap. So much so, in fact, that you sometimes forget he’s a giant red… thing. But look at him! He’s covered in makeup and prosthetics, and yet it’s Hellboy’s acerbic, witty, pained personality that comes through. That there is some fine acting.Guillermo del Toro’s stylish (as always) comic-book movie gets high marks for flash and substance, allowing multilayered, unorthodox characters to seem as regular as the neighborhood mailman, save for the superpowers and massive strength and intelligence. Hellboy 2 is an elegant, ravenous blend of humor, horror, and deadbolt action, a worthy successor to the original.",8,1,1,9 January 2009
Cloverfield," 'Amateur' film looks like a crappy home movie
","Some people may remember the heady days of 1999, when there was slow Internet hype of a low-budget first offering by two unknown filmmakers named Sanchez and Myrick. When it first hit theaters, The Blair Witch Project, was a welcome change from the almost-antiseptic approach that directors were taking to movies; most scary action movies seemed almost too stagy, too unreal, to implausible. Blair Witch used a hand-held camera and was marketed as lost, recovered footage of an experience in the woods gone awry.Here in 2008, though, the anarchic, subversive idea of hand-held, intentionally amateur cinematography is almost passe', isn't it? Since 1999, audiences have seen reality television shows and gritty, dirt-in-your-face movies that aim for an ultrareal effect; consequently, the novelty has worn off. We're no longer amused by footage we could have shot ourselves, and we're no longer automatically terrified when something scary is filmed with a camcorder.In Cloverfield, a group of young people is throwing a going-away party in New York City for one of their own; Rob, who is assuming a high-paying job in Japan. Naturally, one of his best friends, Hud, videotapes the party, asking various guests to offer testimonials to Rob, sort of as one would do at a wedding reception. Then BOOM, there's a loud explosion, and the guests flip on the TV - looks like a giant something or other is attacking the city.Because everything is seen through the camcorder that Hud is lugging around, we're supposed to feel a kinship with these pretty twentysomethings, although to be frank they look and act a little more like teenagers. Using Hud's camera, director Matt Reeves introduces us to a few characters who may or may not make it through to the end of the film. We're told very little about them, but it's quickly evident that the people on whom the camera does linger will be characters we'll follow after the tragedy strikes.On the plus side, the monster is hardly seen at all, really just in shadows and the like, until near the very end of the movie, and no explanation is offered as to where it came from. The result of this, though, is that the focus is shifted to the game effort put forth by our survivors as they attempt an inexplicably dumb quest. The instant they decide that's what they're gonna do, you start guessing which of them will be killed off.At any rate, such a focus means that it's pretty important that the actors themselves turn in strong, evocative performances, and no one here does. The impression one gets is that the actors were hired mainly because they weren't supertalented thespians, that producer J.J. Abrams was going for amateur-looking acting to go along with the amateur-looking camera-work. I get that, I really do, it's just that watching a 90-minute home movie isn't all that interesting when you can tell a lot of the special effects were done with CGI.This movie represents some of the worst aspects of cinema verite. The haphazard, slapdash camera-work is, of course, how you or I might use a camcorder, so it's realistic; on the other hand, most people don't want to watch a homemade film to which they have no connection. If my friends had made this, I might have been into it a bit more, but the film never engages its audience. (The party is an obvious contrivance to attempt to engage us, but it just shows me a bunch of pretty young people acting like doofuses.) And because there are all of these zooms to the left and right and up and down and whoops here we go, falling and gasping, it's tough to make sense of what's going on. Sure, I know, that's how the characters feel, too - what's attacking us? Where should we go? What should we do? - but I am not the characters, and in this case, seeing things through their eyes just makes me dizzy and not care about them much at all.And that, dear friends, is the crux of the problem. The movie wants you to be right down there in the trenches with the characters, but to do that it's got to make you like the characters, root for them in some way, and it just plain fails to do so. Instead, we're treated to nearly 90 minutes of people running here and there and getting attacked by who knows what, and so forth (there are a LOT of shots of feet, as Hud's camera is pointed straight down a lot of the time). To put it simply, it's like watching any other loud, dumb action movie, only instead of excellent camera angles and world-class cinematography that grabs you by the throat and never lets go, you get some brain-damaged diphthong toting a home video camera like it's 1990 and he's at his first no-adults party.I initially thought that the long buildup to the monster attack itself was a bad idea in itself; we get endless shots of the party and the people in it, merely for exposition and empathy. 'Bring on the monster!' I shouted, internally. And then the attack comes, and for the rest of the film you feel like you're on a roller coaster ride after having eaten fourteen hot dogs.Cloverfield isn't worth the endless, smug, metahype it generated for itself leading up to its release. It means to be edgy and groundbreaking but winds up being tired and played out. The monster does look pretty cool, and some of the stunts are worth watching, and there are some genuine scares, but overall it misses its mark by quite a bit. The rolling head of the Statue of Liberty is clever, but that's about it for wit.",3,2,4,19 January 2008
Silent Hill," A bit hokey, film doesn't quite click
","Before you even press play on your DVD, you have to realize that Silent Hill is based on a video game, and that's usually a bad sign - note Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, and last year's Alone in the Dark. Bad movies come from even the best video games, so already Silent Hill has a strike against it.But ultimately what does Silent Hill in is its incomprehensibility. Oh, the plot is fairly easy to figure out, and luckily enough there are a few moments of exposition in which everything is painstakingly explained to the faithful, luckless viewer. It's just that the movie is so darkly filmed, it's often impossible to discern what's happening in any given scene.Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher (Sean Bean, who's underused) have a young daughter named Sharon (ha, get it, Rose of Sharon? Nah, coincidence). Sharon sleepwalks and mutters about a place called Silent Hill so, against her husband's wishes, Rose decides in the middle of the night (?) to take Sharon to this mysterious place. I mean, who wouldn't? Surely the key lies there and not in, say, locking the door to the house so Sharon can't sleepwalk her way off a cliff, as she almost does in the first scene? Nah, that would be too easy.So Rose gets it in her head to take Sharon there in hopes that the town - a ghost town with a 40-year-old coal fire burning beneath it - will somehow trigger a cure in her daughter. A cop pulls her over on the way, but Rose panics and floors her SUV, and a high-speed chase - at night, in the rain - is underway. Yep, real Mommy of the Year material, she.Inexplicably (meaning a combination of stupidity and rain), the vehicle crashes, and Rose finds herself in Silent Hill - and Sharon's gone. So now she has to go find the little kid. Who she brought there in the first place. I kind of felt my sympathy for Rose ebbing at this point.Meanwhile, Christopher is trying to find both Rose and Sharon. He doesn't get to do much other than Fight the Man on the outside, but his actions provide some background to the whole mess (i.e., why is Sharon having these episodes, what is Silent Hill the town hiding, and so on), because he's able to search records, or at least try to access them, leading to confrontations with The Man. Well, the sheriff, anyway.If you've never played the game - which I suspect would be a lot of you - then you'll likely find the whole thing to be a gobberslop of gore. (I'm thinking of trademarking 'gobberslop,' because I like the way it sounds and I think I made it up.) It's particularly gruesome near the end, but really the entire movie is a crimson cannonball.The ending is a bit open ended, which might be the movie's saving grace. It's left up to the viewer's interpretation. Overall, though, it's not very tightly plotted or interesting - odd, since it was written by Roger Avary, who co-wrote Pulp Fiction.",4,0,1,11 September 2006
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Unfortunately tepid and listless adaptation
","If you're expecting insurmountable intrigue from this adaptation of the John Le Carre novel, you might be in for some disappointment. The mood is well set, the scenes are well shot, and the thespians are at the top of their games, but the plot plods, so much so that you wind up not really caring who the bad guy turns out to be. Or, if you do care, you find that you yourself had narrowed it down to Him or The Other Guy about an hour earlier than George Smiley.Smiley (Gary Oldman) is a recent retiree of The Circus, the nickname for Britain's intelligence operations. More accurately, Smiley was forced out, along with the operations' leader, Control (John Hurt) when a mission in Hungary went horribly wrong. But now Britain suspects that a mole has infiltrated The Circus - and it's residing at the top of the metaphorical food chain. Smiley is brought in on the down-low to find out who the mole is and what he's up to.If it seems like a standard spy film, that's because it really is. Except that in this case, Control has figured out that one of five men - the tippy-top of The Circus - is the mole. Already, then, our list of suspects is narrow. Because of this, you might expect the movie to include plenty of distracting action, perhaps some crazy chase scenes, people dangling off landmarks, that sort of thing. But it's not to be. Instead, we get a somewhat painful slog through Smiley's endless detective work. There's hardly any action at all; there's a lot of thinking, which is logical given the chess-like nature of the spy business, but it doesn't often make for good cinema. In fact, there are long stretches where Smiley hardly utters a word, even in voice-over. This makes things a little tougher to follow, and I found myself overthinking the plot. The story turns out to be a lot simpler - and more simplistic - than I'd imagined.The novel was adapted into a BBC miniseries in 1979. I have not seen this miniseries, which starred Alec Guinness as Smiley, but I have to imagine that because it was shown in seven parts, more time was devoted to fleshing out the characters and their motivations. It's a little easier to provide subtle details in a longer format, after all, and this big-screen version skimps on the subtleties and leaves us with dull, somnolent machinations, some of which are obvious red herrings. Oldman, of course, makes a great George Smiley, and it's interesting how much he looks like a younger John Hurt, who here plays his superior. I don't think of Oldman as, pardon the pun, an old man, and he is only 52 years old. But he adapts a quaint, stooped mannerism to Smiley that evokes a man who's always thinking two steps ahead of his opponents. But it's not enough, not even with the capable supporting cast, which includes Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Toby Jones. There's just not a lot to figure out, and when it's figured out, it's too tidy - especially the ending, which is so obvious that it can be view from outer space, as the saying goes. Side note, though: this version contains quite a bit more blood than you'd expect (even with so little action); the level of gore in those scenes approaches the overall tone of, say, Seven. So be warned - this ain't for the kiddies.Overall, the adaptation is a bit of a disappointment, given the source and the talent. It manages to take a spy thriller and remove the thriller part. Less thrilling doesn't taste great.",5,5,10,14 December 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Good family action
","Even if you've never heard of the Tintin character, let alone read the classic Herge comics, this movie of his adventures is terrific from start to finish, complete with invigorating characters, dazzling effects (special and otherwise), exotic settings, and unabashed, wall-to-wall exhilaration and excitement. I enjoyed it.Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell) is a young-lad reporter who, apparently, finds himself in extraordinary situations with some frequency. While shopping in a local market, he purchases a model boat called the Unicorn. Almost immediately, Tintin and his faithful canine friend Snowy are pursued by the mysterious Mr. Sakharine (Daniel Craig), ostensibly so that the latter can complete his collection. But of course that's not the real reason, is it? No, he's after more, much more. It all has to do with the Unicorn's real-life namesake and what happened to it (scuttled at sea) and, more importantly, what it carried. Right off, Tintin (okay, Snowy) discovers a scroll hidden in the model's mast that may be a clue to something bigger - but there are two other scrolls.It's an old-fashioned treasure hunt. Tintin runs into a frequently inebriated Captain Haddock (voice of Andy Serkis), who has a strong connection to the original Unicorn and to the scrolls themselves. With Haddock and Snowy at his side, Tintin races across the globe to solve the mystery before Sakharine, a journey that takes him to multiple continents, fighting bad guys with swords, guns, fists, and feet. It's a throwback movie; a movie quite similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, itself a throwback to the serials of the early 20th century. And, of course, the director here is one Steven Spielberg, whom you might recognize as a progenitor of that Raiders universe himself.The movie is animated, both literally and figuratively, and the animation is so exquisitely realistic that it's easy to perceive it as completely lifelike. The action is intense and relentless, but because of the depth of detail in the animation, it's tough to imagine it as anything other than a terrific live-action film. When Tintin leaps from building to building or from a moving car, we actually cringe - can he make it? Here's an added bonus - apparently, the movie is very close to the source material. Tintin has not been updated or modified to mollify new audiences; remember, so many Americans have never heard of the intrepid reporter. And there's no time waste on explaining who Tintin is, or what he is, or how old he's supposed to be. You know why? Because it's irrelevant, that's why. He's just an adventuring dude with a smart dog and a lot of panache. Bell, Serkis, and Craig are all superb in their roles (the latter two have dual roles each). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost show up as Interpol agents named Thompson and Thompson and offer excellent comic relief; are they bumbling, or are they just that good? It's the latter.There really is so much to like about this movie, and it's one of those rare films that can be recommended not only to children in general but to girls and boys alike. It's artful, engaging, fascinating, and wonderful to behold.",8,8,9,11 November 2012
Ocean's Twelve," Turgid then clever
","Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his bad of idiosyncratic thieves are tracked down, one by one, by casino owner Terry Benedict, from whom the Eleven stole $160,000,000. Benedict wants his money back - plus interest - or else. In this milder, innocuous sequel to the 2001 film (itself a remake of the 1960 film), the Eleven-Plus-One must pull off three major robberies in Europe to satisfy Benedict.It's an intriguing premise, and yet for some reason I thought the idea was that they were going to perform all three capers at the same time, which would have been a neat feat to watch, what with the gang having only eleven members. But alas and alack, that's not how it shook down. What we do get are three separate robbery attempts, each running into greater difficulty than the previous. Kind of like the logistics of getting a whole mess o' Big Stars to rearrange their schedules so they could work on this floppy film at cut-rate prices.Danny and his boys have their work cut out for them, because they also have a rival - the Night Fox, a wealthy man-about-town who effortlessly steals, steals, steals. Seems he's the best there is, ever was, ever will be, or something like that. And he's one step ahead of Ocean all the time. Don't you just hate people like that? Meanwhile, Linus (Matt Damon) wants a larger role in the planning of heists and such, perhaps as a sidekick/apprentice to Danny and Rusty (Brad Pitt). Why director Steven Soderbergh thought Linus needed more screen time is beyond me; the whole secondary plot of the misfit Linus trying to assert himself seemed a bit out of place - and quite a bit of a stretch for Movie Star Matt Damon.Which kind of brings me to another slightly annoying aspect of the movie - all the Movie Stars. Sure, I know they all took way-smaller salaries to work on this film, and bravo to them. But you could never get away from the fact that this was a star-studded affair, something a little above Battle of the Network Stars but not quite as good as, say, Chicago. Pitt and Clooney usurp most of the screen time anyway, although Damon and Julia Roberts are a close second. Luckily, there are plenty of other familiar faces: Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck ... Oh, and did I mention Catherine Zeta-Jones? She's an intrepid Interpol agent who shares a past with Rusty, and she's hot on the trail of the Ocean Gang. Unfortunately, she's a bit underused, although a late subplot about her works fine, although it seems shoehorned in.The plot gets a little complicated at times, and you might well ask yourself, 'Where are they now? Why are they doing that?' and so forth. I liked the intricacies of the plot of the 2001 film, but for some reason this script left me a little cold. Complex is fine, but the plot still needs to draw you in, and it just didn't do so this time around.The first half of the movie kind of dragged a bit for me, but I'm glad I stuck with it. In the second half, there are a couple of excellent cameos - both surprises to me - and some clever twists indeed. The action in the latter half of the movie did make up for the torpidity (look it up!) of the first half. Kudos to George Nolfi's script, albeit somewhat grudgingly.The acting isn't bad at all; in fact, the players all seem to be enjoying themselves immensely, which is kind of what all-star movies are all about.",6,0,0,2 June 2005
Crash," Avoid it - it's an insult to anyone's intelligence
","Crash is about thirty-six hours in the lives of various, disparate people in Los Angeles, told as a series of interconnecting vignettes. Some of the people are good, hardworking souls just trying to scrape by, and others are bad people bent on destruction and menacing. By the end, though, some of the good people have done bad things, and some of the bad people have done good things. And they all grew as people as a result.This wasn't an easy movie to get through. To begin with, nearly every character is despicable in his or her own way. Not so much that one can easily classify them as Bad, no - it's more as if each was being presented as a Good person with Flaws. The downside to that, though, is that it makes rooting for any of the characters is nearly impossible.Another problem is the writing. Everything is film with such a heavy, hamfisted attitude! Person A has something happen to them, so of COURSE they're going to emerge as a better person as a result. I mean, I'm glad that things don't always turn out like rainbows and unicorns and happy crap like that for our brave characters, but does their redemption (or fall from grace) have to happen so obviously? It's as if the viewer has been hit over the head with a frying pan - BAM! THIS PERSON DID A BAD THING. THEY ARE NOW NOT AS GOOD AS YOU THOUGHT. And then BAM! you get hit again, because the same knucklehead did something else.I didn't like anybody, and I had a strong sense that if I ran into any of them, anywhere, they sure as heck wouldn't like me, either. What a bunch of miserable, whiny, self-obsessed, self-absorbed twits these people are. Convinced they are right, they haphazardly stomp about the movie, glaring menacingly at people who are different from them, which naturally is supposed to teach us, the unwashed audience, that Different Is Good, and these people Just Don't Get It (Yet).Paul Haggis wrote, directed, coproduced, and wrote some of the music for the movie. Interestingly enough, the Scottish dish haggis smells just as bad as this movie. What should have been melodramatic was instead uproariously funny; it helps when you've actively decided to dislike the characters. I wished for their deaths, and I bet some of you will, too.Don Cheadle continues to prove he's a great actor, and Ludicrous was surprisingly convincing, walking away with most of his scenes. But the rest of the gang was dull and trite, doing little with the admittedly awful material with which they had to work. But don't feel too bad for them, folks, because at least they didn't have to listen to the soundtrack, which seemed to consist of one long Enya-like tribute. I suspect it was actually several songs, but it seemed like a continuous stream of overemoting - and inappropriately, at that. You know how in horror films there's this music that'll play that lets the audience know Something Bad Is Gonna Happen? That's what the music here was, only it never stopped.",1,49,89,7 November 2005
Snatch," This Snatch is slippery
","Guy Ritchie, the Man Who's Married To Madonna, directed this movie about missing jewels in London's boxing underground. Played out in the Goodfellas vein, there are characters with colorful personalities to match their colorful names, including Franky Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth Tony, One Punch Mickey O'Neil, Boris the Blade, Turkish, and Brick Top. Stylish and violent - but not in an off-putting way, if you're a fan of the genre, Snatch is all about ice, doublecrossings, fights, guns, blood, guts, ah, the fun never ends.   Brad Pitt plays a pugilistic gypsy (he's 'One Punch') who delivers a wonderful engaging performance, speaking his lines in an almost unintelligible dialect. You see, everyone in the film (except for Dennis Farina, who plays Cousin Avi from the U.S.) is British. If you've never heard any Briton speak other than the high-class West End junk that the Queen uses, you'll be in for quite of a shock here. But once your ear gets tuned in to the accents, you'll be fine. (Of course, Pitt's Mickey was given that garbled tongue as kind of a way for the writer to poke fun at Britain's own dialects, which are understandably tough for non-Britons to decipher.) There are fixed fights, botched robberies, a dog who may have eaten a diamond, carnivorous pigs, and a getaway driver who has trouble getting away. You remember when Quentin Tarantino reintroduced the caper-gone-bad genre with movies like Pulp Fiction and reservoir Dogs? This one carries the torch a little bit further, and it's carried by a solid ensemble cast that includes Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro (Frankie Four Fingers), Farina, and Pitt. The rest of the gang you might not recognize, but they're also not characters that simply dissolve into a scene, either. You know the kind - in a subpar gangster movie, all of the hitmen look alike. Not here. This is a cool, fun action film with panache and a touch of humor in the right places (sick humor, though).",7,0,0,16 July 2001
The Beach," Beach plays like a fish out of water
","When Leonardo DiCaprio was riding the wave of Titanic's seemingly endless cashflow, he considered carefully which screen roles to pursue next. Should he be a dashing hero, or a romantic lead? For any newly minted Hollywood star, the next role or roles are exceedingly crucial. The follow-up to a blockbuster doesn't have to make as bombastic a splash as its predecessor, but it can't get by with just a ripple, either.So what does the so-called 'King of the World' choose to do? This adaptation of Alex Garland's novel about a young lost soul who wants to get more out of life and finds an island paradise in the South Pacific. Remember how Lord of the Flies was? Well, if you had any English in high school or college, you'll remember that the setting there was an island where prep-school boys had crashlanded. And all goes well, until they submit to their base instincts and become savages. When Richard (DiCaprio) and his friends find this island, that movie/book was the first thing I thought of. It's all there - the rituals, the diversions, the bonding-through-suffering. And it's all very, very well photographed, too. In fact, the more I looked at the island, the more it looked like the one in Survivor on CBS, only with fewer rats and a whole heaping helping of marijuana. Seems the people on the island are basically self-sufficient, leaving the world behind and taking care of themselves, save for occasional forays back to the mainland for goods they can't get on their own island.This movie just solidifies the old theory that says if you take a mediocre actor and put him in a BIG MOVIE, where the BIG special effects are the main draw, he'll do just fine; put him in a movie where he actually needs to ACT, and he's not so hot. DiCaprio's character isn't particularly nice, which is fine; but he's also played in a hopeless, one-dimensional way, with a careless - not necessarily carefree - attitude. I'm sure DiCaprio is a good guy; at least I have no evidence to the contrary. But in this film, there simply isn't any THERE there. His character, essential to the plot, since he's the protagonist, is about as effective as the proverbial puptent in a windstorm.It goes without saying that DiCaprio got script approval, too - coming off Titanic, and all - since he seems to be able to bed down with practically every female in the movie. Which is kind of eerie, since to me he looks about 12 years old. But hey - some people seem to think he's hot stuff. Oh, and despite a lot of swimming and rain, Leo's hair never seems to move much, but maybe I'm just nitpicking.As for the plot - well, like most of the dung floating on the big screens these days, you should be able to predict it all the way through. Some of the actions of these islanders will leave you scratching your head. If this is what would happen in a paradise setting with so-called 'civilized' people, I'll take savage headhunting tribes any day.I won't lay all of the blame on poor Leo. The acting is absolutely wretched, and the whole time I'm watching this dreck I'm wondering why these infantile boobs were even STAYING on the island. I know, that's a slap at the screenwriting as much as at the acting. But aside from the magnificent scenery, this is a virtually unwatchable movie.Your best bet is to simply skip this yawner and check out Survivor itself. At least there the actions and reactions are a little more realistic - although, knowing how well-staged that show is, maybe not all THAT realistic.",3,2,4,25 July 2000
The Expendables," Solid escapism
","The Expendables is a bad-ass movie. It's a real throwback to the mindless action movies of the 1980s, and as an added flourish it even brings back some of the stars of those cheesefests. It's certainly not plot heavy, but it delivers what it promises – nonstop action, easily identifiable bad guys, and the occasional bon mot or two.Sylvester Stallone plays Barney Ross, leader of a team of mercenaries. Ross is hired by the mysterious Mr. Church (note: not his real name) to travel to a remote island and overthrow a dictator. But, naturally, things aren't quite as they seem, although plenty of stuff blows up. Later, to redeem his soul, Ross returns to the island to set things aright, and more stuff blows up.Ross's team includes knife man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), weapons expert Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), demolitionist Toll Road (Randy Coutre), and sniper Gunner (Dolph Lundgren). Church is played by an uncredited Bruce Willis, and that's not a spoiler, since he featured in the trailer. Also in the trailer, showing up for one scene, is Arnold Schwarzenegger.Thankfully, we're spared some real cheese, such as an 'I'm getting too old for this' line or other references to the ages of some of the cast. Also along for the ride is Mickey Rourke as the owner of a tattoo parlor/bar, Eric Roberts and Stone Cold Steve Austin as bad guys. All are good at what they do, and truth be told Rourke brings plenty of effortless charisma to his minor role. This is not a movie that's miscast, and it's not a buyer's-remorse movie, either. You get what you expect to get when you mix these actors and this plot.The movie's not heavy on plot. I've already touched on the high points, but really you could pop in at any moment during the film and pick up the storyline in no time. It's not Memento, for crying out loud. It's violent, very bloody, and terrifically well choreographed. The filmmakers wisely shot some of the more intense fight scenes in the dark, the better to mask the perhaps-not-awesome fighting abilities of some of the actors. But even though the action never lets up, it's not impossible to follow, and neither is it implausible. Okay, maybe a little disbelief must be suspended, but for the most part it's all reasonable.I enjoyed it. The Expendables proved to me that solid action movies that don't depend on a name brand can survive, as this one did rather well financially – well enough that a sequel is planned. It's not a disappointing movie if you like explosions and other manly pursuits. There are car chases, hot women, plenty of guns, exotic locales, and some plot. What more could you want?",7,3,8,16 June 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Absolute must-see - don't worry about the subtitles!
","Are you the kind of moviegoer who just doesn't cotton to subtitled films? If you're like me, you have enough trouble following the spoken words and the images on the screen without also having to wrestle with text. For me, it's especially tough when the movie depends strongly on dialog for its success. So for the most part, I avoid subtitled movies. I'll watch 'em, but it darn well better be an awesome film.Pan's Labryinth is an awesome film, and I mean that it's both awe-inspiring and excellent. The movie is full of lush imagery that at times cascades gently over the viewer, lulling them into acquiescence, and other times jarring him into reality. It's simultaneously beautiful, arresting, dreamy, and terrifying.The story centers on young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a bookish sort who's been uprooted by her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez) in a remote military stronghold in Spain during World War II. The Franco government has just assumed control, and Vidal's troops are there to fight rebels stationed in the woods, all while rationing food to the needy villagers around them.As if this situation weren't unnerving enough, Ofelia's mother is very late in her pregnancy (by the Capitan, of course), and the pregnancy isn't proceeding smoothly; in an ominous sign, the caravan ferrying Ofelia and Carmen to the castle has to stop when Carmen becomes ill.On top of dealing with these very real problems, Ofelia finds herself drawn to a huge labyrinth located in the garden of the vast estate. The housekeeper, Mercedes, warns the imaginative Ofelia not to enter the labyrinth, because its myriad turns would be very dangerous indeed for her young charge.In the middle of her first night in the castle, Ofelia awakes and finds herself drawn to a pit near the labyrinth. Descending its narrow stone stairs, she finds Pan (Faun in Spanish), a servant of the Lord of the Underworld. Pan tells Ofelia that she is actually the Princess of the Underworld, and that she must perform three tasks so that she can leave her human body and return to be by the side of her father.To describe these three tasks would be to give away a bit too much, but suffice to say that they aren't as simple as saying one's prayers or sneaking a loaf of bread away from the kitchen. But Ofelia does choose to complete them; she decides that given the evil of her malignant, torturing stepfather (a despot in training during the Fascist regime), she would rather follow her limitless imagination.Meanwhile, a parallel storyline involves the rebels, who have a source inside the castle: Mercedes. Vidal is determined to root all of the rebels out of the woods and exterminate them all, and they are equally determined to overthrow him and return freedom to the masses. As well, Carmen's pregnancy becomes even more difficult, and it is only a matter of time before the three threads come to a head.Perhaps the most striking of the many visual desserts in the movie is that of the Pale Man, one of the demons that Ofelia must encounter during her travails. The scene is a banquet table with a lush array of foods and drinks. At one end sits a creature. The creature is tall, but humanoid in shape. It has long arms and arrow-sharp fingers with nails resembling talons. It is hairless and virtually skinless as well, and it has no eyes. Its mouth is a gaping maw, bereft of lips; a cold, stark, ugly beast that immediately fills one with horror and dread. On the table before the creature are two eyeballs; when the Pale Man is aroused, it grasps the eyeballs with its gnarled hands and slaps them into the palms, then holds the arms at head's height in order to see its prey.Guillermo del Toro's film is highly imaginative, almost decadent in its lushness, evocative in both beauty and ugliness, in Ofelia's innocence, Carmen's and Mercedes' love, and Vidal's demonic cruelty. Vidal is a terrible sight, a by-the-book murderous fiend who will stop at nothing to completely eradicate everyone who opposes him, including the weak and the infirm. Lopez's performance is gut-wrenching, despicable, and sincere. The precocious Baquero, as Ofelia, is a perfect foil to the haunting Vidal, combining her natural, wide-eyed naiveté and curiosity with resolve, intelligence, and self-sufficiency.This original film is Mexico's 2007 entry as Best Film in a Foreign Language for the Academy Awards, and it really should win. Had it been in English, I have no doubt it would have been considered for Best Picture. It really is that good; don't let your aversion to subtitles prevent you from seeing one of the most magnificent films of the decade.",10,3,7,20 January 2007
Knocked Up," One-dimensional and unsure what it wants to be
","Knocked Up is one of those movies that seems to get instant cult status, based partly on its pedigree (guys from The 40 Year Old Virgin and recent Will Ferrell movies) and its appeal to twentysomething stoner/slackers. But although some of the jokes are pretty good, and the performances are mostly spot-on, the film's pretty uneven; the funny parts are mostly funny, but the so-called sincere parts come off as maudlin or treacly.Ben (Seth Rogen) is the slacker/stoner in question here. He and his not-all-there buds (ha! check out the double meaning) are in the process of launching a website dedicated to finding nudity in mainstream movies. If you immediately said, 'What, like Mr. Skin?' you're in the target audience. So basically, Ben has no job, and neither do the rest of the man-children in his posse.Contrary to that is Alison (Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy), an E! entertainment producer-type who's just been given a shot at working in front of the camera. So she heads out to a club with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and winds up hooking up with Ben. Of course, she was drunk at the time - Heigl is a pinup model and Rogen is a fat slob. So you know it's sort of true to life in that sense.Fast forward eight weeks later, and Alison's preggers. Whoopsie daisy. Now how will these two lustbirds reconcile the fact that they don't really know each other with this impending birth? Or, for that matter, the fact that while sober neither has anything in common with the other? As I said, scenes that are supposed to be funny usually work, because Rogen is just doofy enough to pull it off; the film works when it pokes fun at Ben's slacker proclivities or the idiosyncrasies of his friends. It doesn't work so much in the way the women are portrayed, however. Look, we've all enjoyed movies in which women are mere objects, right? Porky's, I'm looking at you! Done right, that sort of approach can be raucously entertaining. But in this movie, the womenfolk alternately come off as wildly bitchy or just humorless. Alison was never really shown to have much of a sense of humor (although there's one scene in which she helps the boys spot nude scenes in films for their website).That's all well and good regardless, because some movies can manage to have 'bad' female characters off of which the males can play. But that's where the schizophrenia of this movie comes into play; is it a low-brow, misogynistic comedy or a relationship movie? Too often, it opted for the latter, and if you're trying to show the trials and tribulations of two crazy kids who aren't even in love with each other, you shouldn't make one of them unlikable and irrational. Even if, you know, that's how it'd be in real life.Judd Apatow, who brought us similarly flawed The 40 Year Old Virgin, compares the burgeoning Ben-Alison relationship to the marriage of Debbie and Pete. Oops, looks like Pete's an inconsiderate jerk! Looks like Debbie's an overreacting, hyperactive nitwit! Of course, Apatow's not saying theirs is the ideal relationship for which Ben and Alison should strive, but he makes it seem as if just having an relationship is a bad idea.And I know I might be in the minority here, but I've never liked humor that serves only to humiliate someone. So when Ben or Alison launches a profanity-laced attack on the other, that's not funny. It's not even entertaining. It's annoying.(Another recurring theme was that Debbie feels unappreciated. Check out the scene in which she and Alison are turned away from a club - Alison because she's pregnant and Debbie because she's, um, old. Leslie Mann is two years younger than me, it should be noted; anyway, the scene is presumably supposed to show the sisters bonding over their respective rejections, but all it did was show Debbie as whiny.) One plus, though - good to see Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly) getting some work; here, he's Alison's boss. His rotten-bitch-sycophant assisant has to go, though. She, like some of the other secondary and tertiary characters, was just thoroughly obnoxious and useless - not funny in the biting, sarcastic way, just caustic and off-putting.",6,0,2,7 November 2007
Megamind," Ferrell's comic talents push this into the positive
","Yes, I know, another stunt-cast animated feature that's sure to appeal to adults as well as to kids. But it's because of that supposed stunt casting that Megamind works, at least to some degree. Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, along with Brad Pitt, own their roles and imbue them with purpose and personality. The animation itself is standard, and the story is simply steady, but everyone involved appears to be having a blast.Megamind (Ferrell) is an evil mastermind whose plotting never pans out. He lives in Metro City (which he amusingly pronounces 'Metr-ocity,' rhyming with 'atrocity'), which is defended by the saint-like Metroman (Pitt). Both hero and villain came to Earth from faraway planets but diverging destinies, and they've been fighting each other almost since their arrival. But every battle ends the same – Megamind is captured and jailed, and later he escapes and begins the feud anew. Until, that is, the day when he finally does defeat Metroman and thus loses his purpose in life. I'm sure we can all sort of relate to that.Other characters include a chirpy reporter named Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey), who's close to Metroman, and Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill), a cameraman who wants to be close to Roxanne. They make unlikely allies and adversaries, and not always with each other. They are also played to opposite degrees of success; Fey is as likable and adorable as always, but Hill is just flat as the doting cameraman. You'd think that would be right up his alley, but a change in character midway through doesn't feel sincere, and it's mostly because Hill himself lacks the poise and panache to pull it off effectively.Fey and Ferrell work very well together here, which shouldn't be too surprising. They're both comic talents, and they know their timing well. But there's this, too: there's a fine line between being funny and being hammy, and it's easy to jump over that line for most comic actors. Give them too much rope, they chew the scenery with it, to mix two completely unrelated metaphors. Each actor has a lot of fun with his or her character (it wouldn't surprise me if there had been some improv involved) without running amok with it. That helps the so-so script and plot devices. Also helping: David Cross as a fish-like alien who came to Earth with Megamind and has been his loyal sidekick ever since. He's named Minion for some reason. (Yes, I am kidding.)",7,1,2,22 August 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Stylish, if a little too musical
","I think the biggest problem I have with Sweeney Todd is with the concept itself, that of a horror musical. There's something just weirdly incongruous about people singing about killing and cannibalism, you know? Maybe it's just me; I like musicals, and I like horror movies, but I don't know if the twain should meet.That said, the time-honored premise of Sweeney Todd is diabolically gruesome, and I mean that in the most positive way. Todd is the former Benjamin Barker, a barber who's been exiled from nineteenth-century London by a corrupt judge, who then swooped in and took Barker's wife from him for good measure. Fifteen years later, Barker, now known as Todd, returns to the city, but his wife Lucy, raped and driven mad by the judge (Alan Rickman) has killed herself, and Todd's daughter Johanna is the judge's ward.Todd opens a barber shop above a bakery owned by a Mrs. Lovett, who's soon encouraging Todd to exact his revenge. They hatch the perfect plan: She needs meat, he needs revenge, so they work in concert, since Todd's moral compass has spun off its magnetic axis. Everyone wins! The movie was directed by Tim Burton, and his imprint is noticeable right from the start, with a rivulet of blood coursing through well-worn machine gears over the title cards. When you think of Tim Burton, you think of stylish, don't you, not placid, or heavily plot driven, or over-the-top action. You think of the visual images, the freewheeling, indelibly intriguing imagination that brought you Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and the Corpse Bride. Here, Burton is incredibly successful; the set pieces are magnificent, as is his use of color. When Todd slashes a throat, vibrant reds attack the screen in stark contrast to the staid, mostly black backgrounds (and the pallid complexions of the Londoners, of course).Prior to the film's release, there was more than a little bit of nervousness about the casting of Johnny Depp, a longtime Burton collaborator. This was to be an adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim stage presentation, a version of the old tale that - surprise - required actual singing. Could Johnny Depp lend enough gravitas to the dark role of Sweeney Todd? Sure, as far as actual acting went, but could he even carry a tune? Turns out he can, although I wouldn't sign him to any recording contracts. He's an okay singer; let's leave it at that. But he's fantastic, naturally, as the demonic barber - who, let's be frank, looks like Edward Scissorhands' dad or perverted uncle.Also proving to be a decent singer was Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. I don't know what it is about Bonham Carter, but she almost always looks like she's playing a strung-out crack addict. Must be the saucer eyes and the paleness. At any rate, she's a real treat, as usual, as the wicked, duplicitous Gothic baker of unique meat pies.The movie is 116 minutes long, but if you cut out the musical numbers you'd be left with perhaps 45 minutes. True, many plot points are expressed via song, but it's not long before those songs feel forced, inauthentic, and superfluous. Granted, the songs themselves are thematically downbeat, not of the happy-joy variety, and granted, they're there to move the plot along, rather than inhibit it, but therein lay a problem. When the actors sang, they sang loudly. When they were merely speaking, they spoke softly. And this wasn't like 1940s musicals, where the songs are telegraphed ahead of time; the actors would go from talking to SINGING to talking to SINGING and I spent much of those 116 minutes adjusting the volume. Seriously - the dialog is so softly spoken it's very difficult to hear, even if the sound's turned up, and what's more, the characters all have nearly unintelligible (to me) Cockney accents that drop vowels, consonants, punctuation, you name it. I needed subtitles.So although the movie didn't quite do it for me, I can appreciate what it was trying to accomplish. Indeed, judging from the many accolades it received, it was quite successful. If you're looking for an ultraviolent horror show filled with singing, you will not be disappointed, although I can't imagine there'd be much competition for that dubious honor.",6,0,1,17 June 2008
Horrible Bosses," A hot Jennifer Aniston with a potty mouth? Sign me up
","We've all had them, although not quite the way these guys do. Mean boss- bullies. What looked at first to be another dopey Office Space wannabe turned out to be pretty hysterical in places. Part of it's the script, but a lot of it is in the casting. Think of it as more than Office Space - it's Office Space with the piquant aftertaste of The Hangover.Nick (Jason Bateman) has one of those tyrannical hate-everyone bosses (Kevin Spacey). Kurt's (Jason Sudeikis) boss is a coked-up freak (Colin Farrell). Dale (Charlie Day) has an oversexed maneater (Jennifer Aniston, playing way against type). Each for his own reason has issues. And, for reasons not necessary to reveal here, they conclude that each supervisor must be killed off.I liked this movie. For one thing, I could - as I'm sure many people can - identify easily with each of the main characters to some extent. They were relatable, not caricatures. I mean, sure, they sort of leap to the conclusion rather quickly that murder should be committed, but that's just nitpicking. You buy into the premise, you take what you get.It's a well-cast film. Bateman surprised me a great deal. When I heard he was to be in this movie, I assumed he'd be one of the bosses, because he's lately played so many smarmy jerks. But not here - here, he's the sensible one, and he gets some of the best lines in the movie. Delivery is flawless. Sudeikis I could do without, but he does add some smarm of his own, thus offsetting Nick's niceness rather neatly. But for me the best was Charlie Day, who's best known for his role on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He's a manic panic and a true comic find. I hope this turns out to be a bit of a breakout role for him.The bosses are also interestingly cast. I mean, I always pictured Aniston as a goody two-shoes. That's the image, right? The good girl who meets cute with someone? Oh, not here. So not here. Here she's about as X rated as you can get. And she's stunningly good at it, too. Doesn't even feel like she's playing a role. Spacey is essentially playing the same role he had in Swimming with Sharks, only even nastier, and of course he's up to the task. Farrell gets the short end of the stick; he gets limited screen time, but that's okay.Horrible Bosses offers plenty of madcap fun at an R-rated level without stooping to poop jokes. A nice switch, wouldn't you say? I mean, it's not Henry V, but at least it's not Freddy Got Fingered. It's at the right intelligence level - you can veg out and enjoy it without feeling the least bit ashamed.",7,0,2,30 March 2012
Black Mass," Perhaps Johnny Depp's strongest performance
","James 'Whitey' Bulger ran South Boston's crime scene with an iron fist in the 1970s and 1980s, but for a good part of his reign of terror he harbored quite a secret – he was actually an informant for the FBI. In particular, he was an informant for Agent John Connolly – although the usefulness of Bulger's intel was often in dispute – all the while continuing his violent rampage over the city against anyone who would stand in his way.The ruthless Bulger is played in Black Mass by Johnny Depp, an actor not really among the first who come to mind when the character of a crime lord is brought up. Depp has long been known for looking the part in each of his disparate roles and avoiding typecasting. But in Black Mass, even though he doesn't look like an Irish mobster – he completely embodies one. It's really his finest work, and that's saying something.The movie is told in flashback, as a member of Bulger's inner circle recounts the whole sordid deal to another FBI agent, including the involvement of Connolly (Joel Edgerton) as well as Bulger's brother, state senator Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). The brutality of Bulger's day-to-day existence isn't tempered; men and women are killed or maimed or harassed for seemingly benign reasons. There seemed to be no middle ground for Bulger. He liked you, you lived. He didn't, you didn't. The movie covers his feud against his Italian rivals in Boston, the Angiulo family, as well as his foray into the high-stakes world of betting on jai-alai in Miami. And how did Bulger get away with so much? Mostly through the protection of Connolly, who used Bulger's (scant) information to further his own career. Crooks protecting crooks. The rabbit hole is deep indeed.But man, is Depp ever great. I stopped thinking of him as Johnny Depp soon after the movie began. It's funny – to look at Bulger in this movie, you probably wouldn't take him for a mob guy. He's wiry, he's balding, he wears glasses. Nothing tough leaps out at you. But the ferocity of Depp's exceptional performance puts that notion to rest. Cumberbatch, as his brother and fellow Boston native, is also very good and with a surprisingly believable accent. Kevin Bacon shows up as an FBI guy; I think this was his third go-around as a Boston-based law-enforcement officer.",7,0,0,18 October 2017
Nacho Libre," Godawful junk, a total disqualification
","Jack Black is a Mexican friar who secretly is a masked wrestler, or luchador. He has the hots for a cute, pious nun and wants to help all the little orphans at his church. It's as awful as it sounds.Ignacio (Black), caught as a child by the brothers stealing materials for a wrestling costume, has worked at the church his entire life as the cook, and he's not terribly good - his specialty appears to be nachos - and he yearns to live free, to express himself, to discover wonderful things. No, wait... he doesn't yearn to do those things. He just wants to wrestle.But wait! The new nun, Sister Encarnacion (the beautiful Ana de la Reguera) doesn't like wrestling. It is violent and bad and stuff, she claims. So Ignacio doesn't mention to her that he has donned tights and a mask and wrestles on the weekends with a partner, Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), a skeletal thief. The two make quite the pair, and they're not very good at wrestling, much like Esqueleto and thieving or Ignacio and cooking. Black probably should have been, pardon the pun, the saving grace of the film, but he's poorly cast and completely unfunny. There's hardly a laugh to be had; what chuckles one gets come from the antics of the seldom-seen orphans, chiefly Chancho. It's not as if Black isn't typically funny, that he's some sort of Serious Actor who hardly ever does funny. He's Jack Black! He's pretty much nothing but funny. Except here, where's he's everything but; he's painful to watch at times.But he's not helped by a meandering film, either. With no belly laughs, one would think the emphasis would be on sentimentality with a dash of light humor. Only you hardly ever get any of that, either, except at the very end with a predictable ending. It's so wildly predictable that you could guess it RIGHT NOW. Without having seen the movie. If this were a parody of fighter films, like Hot Shots was of fighter-pilot movies, then the deadpan deliveries might make some sense - if, of course, they were accompanied by actual jokes, even throwaway lines. Otherwise, one might make the mistake of thinking the movie was set in a more-melodramatic period, where people left their lovers by fog-dampened train and the star quarterback married his sweetheart right after scoring eleventy-five points against Big Mean Old Jerks U in the homecoming game. But it's not that, either; everyone, save perhaps the radiant de la Reguera, seems listless, sleepwalking through a dull pseudocomedy that shouldn't be mentioned again.Heck, they don't even get the wrestling part of things right, as Ignacio (wrestling as Nacho) and his various opponents do all sorts of things that would be forbidden in a true luchador match, such as a pinfall outside the ring, the removal of a mask, and so forth. I guess the gang behind this one felt they needed to include more American wrestling features, you know, to sex it up a little.About the only saving grace is de la Reguera, who, although she's given nothing with which to work, does manage to come out of it looking fine; I'm sure she'll be able to use her role as a springboard to better things, although if I were her I'd put 'Was in Jack Black film' on my resume and hope no one asks questions.*1/2",2,7,14,4 December 2006
The Town," Ghost Town - missing solid central character
","Although tensely made and full of explodey goodness, Ben Affleck's The Town suffers from a knack of reaching into the cliché sack a few too many times. It also suffers from being directed by Ben Affleck, who surrounds himself here with people who can act circles around him, making him – as the central character – look really one dimensional. It's as if Carrot Top made a movie with Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Ralphe Fiennes, and Greta Garbo.Affleck plays a bank robber named Doug (ha! a thug named Doug!). A rather successful bank robber, at that. (It's noted before the titles that that the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown is notorious for turning out scads of bank robbers.) During a holdup, Affleck's masked gang temporarily takes bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage; believing her to be a loose end who might be able to identify them, Doug trails Claire and meets cute with her, hiding his secret. Concurrently, an intrepid FBI agent – no other kind in moviedom – played by Jon Hamm is closing in.Among Doug's gang is Jem (Jeremy Renner), a loose cannon who enjoys the thrill and violent nature of their escapades and who spent a nine-year hitch in prison, so you know he's tough as can be. While Doug is portrayed as thoughtful, careful, and caring, Jem is the foul-mouthed jerk who supposedly shorter on brains than Doug. Jem immediately questions the wisdom of dating their former hostage; if he had his druthers, he'd just kill Claire and be done with it. But that would go against the gang's mantra of not killing people, so Doug gets to keep seeing Claire. You know, to find out what she knows. Or if she's talked to the feds.The movie asks us to believe two conflicting things about Doug: that he's amoral (he is a bank robber, after all) and yet moral (i.e., cares for Claire, cares for his buddy Jem, cares for Jem's sister Krista, cares for almost everyone. He's sort of a sensitive Clyde Barrow. Affleck's not a terrible actor, but it's tough to really buy into him in this role. He has the accent down (big surprise there), but he seems to equate speaking softly and looking pensive with a multilayered performance.Another problem is Claire herself. Seems like a nice person, although she falls for Doug pretty quickly (they meet in a laundromat shortly after the robbery). And although she's pretty upset when she eventually learns the truth about Doug, she still gives him a chance. Why she would do this is anyone's guess. If they'd been together years, it still wouldn't make much sense. He's a bank robber, not Robin Hood. He's not a good guy.The movie is fast paced, so these plot problems aren't really that big of a deal. By the way, while Dougie is trying to get in good with little miss Claire, he's still robbing banks, so of course you can see the standard 'this is my last job' deal coming from a mile away. Doug's group gets its jobs from The Florist, played by Pete Postlethwait in his final role; he gives them all the intel they need, and they pull off the job. It's a working system, so why break it? I just think we'd have a little more sympathy for Doug if, say, he had to rob banks in order to pay the mortgage in a terrible economy, or he had a wife and two kids with a third on the way and his wife was dying of some lung disease, like in Brooklyn's Finest. You know, a fairly good guy forced to do bad because of circumstances. But that is not the case here. There's no reason for us to like Doug, and so he's a pretty unlikeable person. Sure, he treats Claire well. Except when he lies to her. Best line: 'I'll never lie to you again!' That's right, trust the nice bank robber. Renner (nominated for an Oscar), Postlethwait, Hall, and even young, lovely Blake Lively (as Krista) completely outshine Affleck, making him look befuddled most of the time, as if he can just about put things together but can't quite get there.And final odd question: are there no razors in Charlestown? Everyone has three-day old growth. It doesn't make them look tough. It doesn't make them look like they've been pulling all nighters to get the job done. It just makes them look like hobos.",5,2,5,4 February 2011
Closer," Blech.
","If you enjoyed Eyes Wide Shut, if you are entertained by long-winded, talky movies about whiny pretty people who can't commit and have no idea what they want, then Closer is your cup of tea. Go see it and love the overwrought cheesy sentimentality out of it.Closer is about four people, two sets of couples, whose lives fall apart when two of them begin an affair with each other. Dan (Jude Law) helps Alice (Natalie Portman) when she's struck by a cab. The two quickly fall for each other, of course. Not long after, Dan - an aspiring writer - has his picture professionally taken for the book jacket of his novel. The photographer is Anna (Julie Roberts); unsurprisingly, Dan falls for her as well, and vice versa. And then somehow Larry (Clive Owen) tumbles into the mix; he's tricked by Dan into meeting Anna, who falls for him, but then he falls for Alice, and... Oh, what's the use? Those of you who love romantic dramas will likely get into this, and those who do not, won't.But here's the thing, okay? It's a talky, slow movie that relies very heavily on a rather turgid, melodramatic script - not to mention the charms of the four very good-looking leads. At times, the dialog really clicks with some subtle, clever twists of the word, but most of the movie is filled with dopey, unrealistic, stilted verbalizations. It's not that the movie doesn't make any sense; on the contrary, it's fairly simple to follow. So simple, in fact, that you can easily tell what's coming next. There are no surprises in Closer.The tone is set very early, with an inexorable opening song that seems to merely repeat its refrain ad infinitum. Much like the movie, which repeats its theme in the same grueling, amateurish manner, only with different characters. Look! Now she's dumping him! Now he's with her and dumping the other one! Woohoo! Go, you wacky lovers, go! The casting is pretty good, though. Julie Roberts can really act, you know, and she's quite effective here. Law isn't bad, but he's been much better - he actually overacts late in the film, going against the grain of understated quiet. They do make a cute couple, though. Which leads me to Portman, who's the lightweight of the bunch. She turns in a fairly good performance, although there were a couple scenes in which she just didn't feel right for the role. Owen's character is the crass bastard of the lot, and the actor is up the task. But damn, Colin! You couldn't shave for the role? You look like you should be hiding in bushes, waiting to flash little old ladies. But then again, that was part of his character's appeal.As interesting as the circuitry in a pocket calculator, as engrossing as a 1975 auto-repair manual, and as excruciating as a long morning in a dentist's chair, Closer is a dream come true for folks who like sitting in a catatonic state, drool seeping out of the corner of their mouths.",2,3,6,22 May 2005
Shutter Island," Minor Scorcese suffers from a lightweight lead
","Leonardo Dicaprio stars as a U.S. Marshal sent to a remote and forbidding insane asylum in 1954 to investigate the disappearance of a patient. As he proceeds, Teddy Daniels uncovers far more than he bargained for - or is it? In a movie in which nearly everything is actually something else, the audience is redirected too many times for this to be an effective thriller, and some gaping holes in the plot should relegate this to the dustbin in no time.We first see Marshal Daniels (Dicaprio) on the way to the island via ferry, with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo). Immediately, we size up our protagonist: prone to seasickness, a little grizzled, possibly wrestling with inner demons. Also has a prominent band-aid on his forehead, and as we all know any time a character shows up with a bandage and no explanation, that bandage will come into play later in the movie.The asylum, Ashecliffe Hospital, is run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), a pipe-smoking medical reformer who nonetheless looks down his nose at everyone else. His right-hand man is the assistant warden, McPherson (John Carroll Lynch), who informs the marshals that they must surrender their guns before they can enter the grounds. Again, something this obvious means that the concept will come up later in the movie, and sure enough it does.Something doesn't quite add up about the missing patient, Rachel Solando. Solando apparently vanished from her room, barefoot, without anyone noticing, on an island. That is covered in rocky terrain. Daniels finds a note hidden under the floor tile that seems to indicate that there's an additional missing patient who's not accounted for. Further galivanting around the island simply unearths more and more facts and clues that don't make much sense. And then we find out that Daniels himself might be hiding something. He fits in very well with everyone else in this regard.The movie is appropriately shot (by Robert Richardson, who's won two Oscars): moody, unflinching, terrifying at turns, well matched to the setting. But the movie has too many problems to be wholly satisfying. During the movie, one of the characters informs Daniels that being declared insane means that anything you do afterwards can be held up as evidence of your insanity. That makes sense, of course, but the trouble is that that logic can be applied to anything in this movie as well, a sort of self-justification. I Call it lazy screen writing.And, honest to goodness, I still don't think Leonardo Dicaprio is much of an actor. His matinée-idol looks are already fading - he's got the head of Charlie Brown at this point - but his range hasn't really improved over the past decade or so. He seems to struggle with his reaction shots, and he doesn't have the gravitas necessary for such a heavy role. I'm supposed to believe he's a federal marshal? I'd have trouble believing he's dressed up as a marshal for Halloween. Here, he's supported by a very capable cast - particularly Kingsley, although he seems to be slumming it a bit, and Patricia Clarkson. But for the most part, his character is on his own, and Dicaprio flounders.Shutter Island is, at best, minor Scorcese, a movie that's high on mood and atmosphere but a little light on a plausible plot. There are too many moments that don't make complete sense when they happen and that can only be supported by the notion that someone - or everyone - is insane.",5,10,21,21 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Roaring action and fun
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier turns out to be about some guy named The Winter Soldier, rather than Cap himself being a winter soldier (you know, because he was in deep freeze). Well, with that mystery solved, I settled in to watch what has become a rather typical comic-book movie: intelligent, evocative, thrilling, and entertaining.Here's your quick-and-dirty summary to set the scene; comic-book nerds out there, please correct me if I'm wrong, because that'll prove someone's reading this other than me. The movie takes place after the events in The Avengers. Captain America (Chris Evans) is trying to assimilate into the present day, and he leads an elite forces team. In the opening scenes, his team, aided by Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson), infiltrate a SHIELD boat that's been commandeered by terrorists who have a beef with SHIELD. Cap and the Gang roust out the bad guys, but Cap is somewhat surprised to see Black Widow grabbing info from hard drives. He's soon briefed by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) that SHIELD is involved in a huge defense program called Project Insight: three enormous helicarriers that are linked to spy satellites, the better to knock out threats before they happen. Shades of Minority Report.Fury has joined forces with the World Security Council and its leader, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) for this enterprise, and true to comic trope, there's soon skulduggery afoot. It's not hard to see who's treacherous and who's not, but that's part of the fun of these movies, anyway. As a result of the cloak-and-dagger atmosphere, Captain America and Black Widow, along with new superhero Falcon (Anthony Mackie), who sports an exoskeleton with wings and weaponry.The movie forces Steve Rogers, aka Cap, to face parts of his past that he might be better off leaving alone. His girl from back in the 1940s, Peggy Carter, is convalescing in a home for retired people, Steve's apparently last living link to that past. But Steve's straight-arrow, black-and-white moral compass seems oddly out of sync with the gray areas of the present, which makes Black Widow a great match for him. You know, opposites and all of that.This is a movie in which secrets upon secrets are revealed, like layers of an onion and often just as odorous. Anyway, although it's not tough for Cap and Black Widow to determine who the bad guys are, stopping said villains is another problem altogether. This leads to several fantastic action scenes, very well choreographed and a treat to watch - even in 2D, or perhaps especially in 2D.I sat, by necessity, in the second row for this movie, which meant that my head was inclined as if I were talking to a giraffe with an overactive pituitary gland. It also meant that I needed to focus harder on the action before me, because at that distance the illusion of the celluloid tale can more easily be broken. This movie captivated me throughout, pardon the pun, and it's a terrific vehicle for both Captain America and Black Widow, not to mention the slippery Nick Fury himself. I did wonder, as the plot centers around something that could endanger the entire world, where was the rest of the Avengers squad? Tony Stark is mentioned once (but not Iron Man), and we see a portrait of his father, but that's it for connections to The Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, and Iron Man. If the world's about to be harmed, you'd think that would rise to the importance level of those guys, right? Okay, that's nitpicking.It's true that the movie's plot is familiar and that many of the characters, being based on comic-book characters themselves, lack real depth. But these problems are minor, because the action scenes - hey, this is a comic-book movie, not some weepy melodrama! - is so exhilarating. Great care has been taken to curate the Marvel Universe in cinematic form, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only a fine standalone picture but also a elegant lead for the next Avengers movie - not to mention future Captain America movies. Watch those end credits!",7,0,1,7 April 2014
Capote," Grandstanding piffle
","To begin with, how you feel about Capote the movie will depend almost entirely on how you feel about Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of him. Some will find his highly mannered performance to be highly grating, while others will note that that's how the real Capote looked and sounded.I fall into the former group. I just couldn't stomach Hoffmann's high-pitched whine. I also didn't care for the breakneck editing, or even the long, tiresome shots of nothing in particular happening. I felt the movie was pretty poorly put together, to be quite frank about it.Although it's a biography of the writer, the film covers the time Capote spent researching and writing his magnum opus, In Cold Blood, from his assignment by The New Yorker to cover the legal proceedings to the final publication of his 'nonfiction novel,' several years later. The focus is on Capote's relationship with the murderers of the title, particularly Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). Capote figures if he gets close to Smith and Dick Hickock, he'll get information he can use in his book. Is he using the killers, or does he really care for him? You wouldn't know from a movie whose script has Capote constantly talking about himself, no matter what the topic is. What, you killed four people in their beds? Pshaw, you should hear about my upbringing. And on it goes.As I said, Hoffman's performance is quite mannered - some might say flamboyant - and there will no doubt be plenty of you out there who will think he was spot on, quite a show, and all that. And there will be plenty others who think about five minutes of hearing him 'talk Capote' would be about four minutes too long.So on to the others in the cast. Catherine Keener, who's been so great in movies like Being John Malkovich and The Interpreter, acts circles around Hoffman. Yes, circles. Keener plays novelist Harper Lee, she of To Kill a Mockingbird fame, and she absolutely disappears into the role - with two exceptions, her dazzling, dancing eyes. Keener is superb, clearly deserving of her Oscar nomination. Lee has a pretty good idea of what Capote's all about, as does his lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). Chris Cooper is along as the sheriff in charge of the case, and Bob Balaban is Capote's publisher.There's far too much focus on the Wonder That Is Truman Capote for a film that insists on covering only one period in his life. Capote is manipulative, egotistical, and constantly condescending. Not an appealing guy, to be sure. And that's fine, but we never really get a sense of what he was about, just how this one event affected him.Interminable and overwrought, Capote is not worthy of its many accolades.",4,17,30,10 February 2006
Life of Pi," Breathtaking visuals complement provocative tale
","In Life of Pi, Ang Lee's philosophical spectacle, makes for a fascinating viewing, succeeding on multiple levels of enjoyment. There's the adventure itself, a massive sojourn of a boy in a lifeboat - with a Bengal tiger. And then there's the meaning of the story itself, which is happily left ambiguous. It's also about the spirit and resourcefulness of man, and above all it's about hope and optimism. Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), named after a famous pool in France, is on his way from his home in India with his mother, father, brother, and a lot of animals (the family owns a zoo) aboard a Japanese vessel, bound for Canada. During a particularly terrifying thunderstorm, the ship sinks, and Pi finds himself on a stocked lifeboat with a few of the lucky creatures (none human) and no idea of his location.The animals are inconsequential except for one - the tiger. How does one survive in a lifeboat with an untamed beast who'd love to make a meal out of him? It's not easy, and luckily our Pi is quite resourceful. Rest assured, though, there is no silent understanding between the two, even as hunger and thirst rob each of his strength. They are not friends. They each wish to survive, although a case can be made that Pi, at least, has no intention of harming/eating the tiger.The tiger is not stupid - oh, quite the contrary, he is a cunning brute. He can't be cowed, and he won't allow Pi to have dominion over the lifeboat, which forces our human hero to construct a sort of floating annex to the boat, tethered and filled with supplies.Of great interest to me were the tantalizing, beautiful aquatic scenes. Whether it was the sight of thousands of fish flying through the air at our passengers or a glimpse into the remarkably clear water to see gorgeous - and sometimes quite large - marine life blithely swimming by, there's rarely a slow moment. Picking up the slack in such matters, of course, is how Pi survives, how he keeps his wits about him, how he manages to get by with a ravenous tiger so close by. If you think that Lee is trying to present a moralistic story to us - he touches quite a bit on religion, for example - you are right. But it's not heavy handed by any means. To illustrate this, Pi (as an adult relating his tale to a writer) notes that when he was a young lad in India, he joined up with several different religions, a way to show us that he was having trouble finding his way, choosing the right path. As his father remarks to him at dinner one night, it is fine to be different, but in the end one must choose a path. Net thing you know, Pi is afloat on a raft, drifting aimlessly across the Pacific Ocean. He still had not found his way.In the end, Lee doesn't appear to be trying to teach his audience. He is not moralizing; he is presenting choices and explaining how, in this situation, a single man found his way through life, not simply to survive but to live. This is not a movie about a boy and his pet tiger roaming the seven seas; it's about learning about one's inner self and finding an exciting direction in which to take it. And even apart from the symbolic journey that Pi involuntarily undertakes, there is a second moral quandary posed at the very end that will get the viewer thinking. And that, to me, is the real selling point of this movie. The beauty, the majesty, the excitement of the cross-sea trip is almost surreal - but sufficiently realistic to allow one to enjoy its wonder. Yet that final question, posed by the adult Pi, seals the deal. This is a movie best seen on a large screen, the better to appreciate its epic scope.",8,4,8,5 January 2013
Ocean's Thirteen," Much better than Twelve - fun, funny thriller
","The really good news is that Ocean's Thirteen is completely enjoyable. I mean, after the crap effort of Ocean's Twelve, who could expect anything, well, good? The last one just felt like a bunch of buddy celebs getting together from some yuks and a good ol' time. But Thirteen tries very hard to make you forget Twelve ever happened, and it largely succeeds.This time around, the boys are out to avenge their good pal Rueben (Elliot Gould), who's been doublecrossed by the nefarious Willie Bank (Al Pacino). Reuben invested heavily in Bank's new, colossal casino in Vegas, but then Bank screwed Rueben out of his share, defrauding him of zillions. The general plan that Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has come up with is to ruin Bank's opening night on many levels - fix games, cause natural disasters, steal his diamonds, make sure the casino reviewer has a bad time, that sort of thing.Gone are the self-indulgent overtones of Twelve, as the series returns to its roots as a crisply written caper punctuated by self-effacing performances and a wild, yet not implausible, plot. And, even better, there are times when I actually laughed out loud. I know! Whoda thunk that? The good news is that through three movies, the main characters haven't changed; they haven't grown, they're not evolving into higher beings, nothing. They are simply who they are. Danny is the leader, a man cool under pressure but not smugly so - kind of like George Clooney offscreen, come to think of it. Well, from what I've heard. Rusty (Brad Pitt) is still his right-hand man. Linus (Matt Damon) appears to be #3, but he's just as much of a doofus as he's always been (this time around, his father makes an appearance). Most of the other guys - including the timeless Carl Reiner as Sol - get short shrift, but whaddya gonna do when you have eleven, twelve, whatever, guys? They can't all get the good lines.One pleasant surprise is that Pacino reins himself in a bit. He's not all eyes-bugging-out mad, like he was in Scarface, or Devil's Advocate, or Any Given Sunday, or a million other movies; no, he's more laid back, but totally in control. Apparently Pacino was the guy that director Steven Soderbergh wanted all along, and he does a damn good job - it's always good to see Al being a Good Actor instead of a ham. Along for the ride is another name actor, Ellen Barkin, who I'm told once was pretty attractive. At any rate, she's Bank's right-hand woman, a sort of Team Evil counterpart to Rusty; Barkin's Sponder is punctual, efficient, and poured into a slinky breast-baring (almost) dress at all times. Arm candy never hurts, thinks Bank. But beware! For some reason Soderbergh gives us a couple of closeups of Barkin. Hide the children! Or use the opportunity to warn them about the dangers of plastic surgery.Okay, enough Barkin bashing, and back to the story. Ocean has all of the angles covered, but at the eleventh hour he finds himself in need of major fundage. Everyone's tapped out, of course, so to whom can they turn but Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the entrepreneur that the Ocean gang beat in the first two films. It's good to see Garcia, and at least his character's appearance here isn't contrived. Well, not too contrived - they didn't know anyone else who could spot them $36 million? Eh, guess not.The one character who annoys me in these movies is Linus Caldwell. He's a pest to Danny and Rusty; although he supposedly has talents, he seems to spend a lot of time being a pain in the ass to everyone. When he comes up with an idea, everyone's shocked, and when he's supposed to be accomplishing something, he fails. At least here his noodginess is less obtrusive than it was in Twelve, when Linus actually ran a plan of his own device. I wonder if the character is supposed to be endearing, almost adorable in how inept he is - if so, though, then Damon really sucks, as the result is that I wish Linus would be killed off.Still. Ocean's Thirteen is lots of fun, way more funner than Twelve, and it helps that the bad guy has a strong, pervasive personality that prevents predictability. I think that, as Soderbergh and Clooney have said, this one makes up for the crap that came before it.",7,0,1,17 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Outstanding.
","Lost in Translation is a bittersweet story of two disparate Americans temporarily in Tokyo. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a has-been actor who's relegated to pitching alcohol in a TV ad; Charlotte (Scarlett Johanson) is the somewhat-neglected wife of a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) who's in town to do a shoot.Charlotte and Bob are staying at the same hotel, and both are living through the same experience of getting through the day as fish out of water. Living the life of a tourist-American isn't always fun and games, you know. Bob just wants to finish his commercial shoot and then get home, even though the marriage with his stateside wife is devoid of passion, and Scarlett isn't quite sure what she wants. It's not improbable that these two should wind up spending some time together, especially since in Tokyo they stick out like the cliched sore thumbs (especially Murray, who's much taller than any of the Japanese around him at all times). They decide to hang out together, to make the most of the time they have to spend in a foreign land.One of the biggest complaints I've heard about this movie is that it's too slow, but I consider that to be its most engaging characteristic. This is not an action movie. This isn't a smart-alecky comedy with rapid-fire hilarity. In essence, it's a two-character study.A good film for comparison is Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise (1995). In that movie, Jesse (an American) and Celine (a Frenchwoman) meet on a train traveling from Budapest to Vienna, and we witness their relationship gradually ascend from that of slight acquaintances to full-blown amour. Bob and Charlotte's relationship progresses much the same way, but it's even more subtle (believe it or not). Charlotte, the lonely photographer's wife, and Bob, the unwilling participant in a disaffected marriage, find in each other a true kindred spirit.This isn't something easily expressed on screen, and even on the printed page it's difficult to pull off. But the masterful Oscar-winning script by Sofia Coppola (who also directed) is so superb in its attention to detail, along with the perfectly nuanced performances of Johansson and Murray (nominated for an Oscar) are the ideal combination. The audience is utterly convinced that these two characeters are meant for each other, at least on some level.Not one note of this movie rang falsely for me, but it is not for everyone. Don't let the multiple Oscar nominations sway you - if you do not like quiet, subtle movies, you probably won't like Lost in Translation. For the rest of you, it's a true gem.",9,0,1,25 April 2004
Tangled," Another charming Disney film
","Tangled is as elegant and exciting as old-school Disney features get. It has the music, it has the charm, and it has the helpful nonhuman acting as the protagonist's conscience. It's also gorgeously animated, with a simple plot that hearkens back to the studio's golden age while maintaining the ability to capture the imagination and attention of today's kids (and adults).True fact: this movie was originally supposed to be called 'Rapunzel,' but execs at Disney figured that wouldn't appeal much to little boys (they'd made a mistake, the thinking went, with an earlier feature, The Princess and the Frog). Thus the title change.So you know the story of Rapunzel, right? Cute lass, trapped up in a tower, had long hair, etc.? Same basic idea here, only Rapunzel is secretly - not a spoiler - the lost princess of the kingdom, spirited away as an infant by an evil crone; seems Rapunzel's hair is not only long but magical as all get out, and the old crone has been able to use the hair - and the girl's song - to retain her youth.Every year on the princess's birthday, the still-mourning kingdom releases hundreds of lanterns into the sky, hoping that somehow their lost child will find her way home. And every year, Rapunzel sees these lanterns and wonders about their source - could they have anything to do with her, since they appear only on her birthday? Enter Flynn Rider (har har), a thief on the run from that very same kingdom for, you know, thieving. Anyway, he runs into Rapunzel, and they make a pact - he takes her to see where the lanterns come from, and she'll return to him the crown that he had just stolen from aforementioned kingdom but she took from him after whacking him on the head with a frying pan. You know, standard Disney fairy-tale stuff.For the most part, the movie is just plain funny. It's about dreams and hopes and how you shouldn't let go of either, even in the face of defeat. And that's a great message, sure. But it helps that Rapunzel and Flynn are aptly cast (respectively, the known Mandy Moore and the unknown Zachery Levi) and that each isn't just a caricature. There's a lot of whimsy to go along with the derring-do, a word that's just not used enough nowadays. (Derring-do, not whimsy.) And yes, it has plenty of heart. It has all the hallmarks of a Disney movie without the debit of latter-day stunt casting. It focuses itself on Rapunzel and Flynn working together to allow the former to realize her dream. Because there are not distinctly comical figures in the movie, the humor simply evolves; it's not forced or distracting. Side note, though - one of the best characters in the film is Maximus the horse; he's at odds with Flynn (trying to capture him, as a horse of the palace) and likes Rapunzel, and he has more personality and expressiveness than most of the humans.",9,1,3,14 August 2011
Interstellar," Shock and awe
","Despite an ear-splitting soundtrack that often threatens to drown out important dialog, Interstellar is a profound hit, a love child of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Contact. Its effects are special, its casting top notch, and its meaning sufficiently ambiguous. In other words, this is a fairly typical Christopher Nolan movie.In the movie, Earth is suffering through historic blight so bad that huge dust storms block out most sunlight and cause major breathing problems for the humans. (And probably the animals, too.) Such has been the sad state of affairs for some time; America in particular has become an agrarian society. Unfortunately, it's a failing society, and it's only a matter of time before the planet is uninhabitable by mankind.Enter ex-scientist/pilot Coop (Matthew McConaughey) who's now a single dad raising two precocious kids along with his father in law. Through a series of plausible coincidences, Coop and his daughter Murphy stumble upon plans to send a manned mission to another galaxy by use of a wormhole - and those in charge want Coop to be the pilot. The idea is that the spacecraft Endurance, piloted by Coop, will fly through the wormhole and land on one or more of three potentially life-sustaining (according to data sent back by probes) planets. Once a suitable planet has been located, citizens of Earth will be transported via space stations - assuming NASA scientist Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) can solve the gravity-is-a-harsh-mistress problem.Aboard the Endurance with Coop are scientists Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romily, and Doyle, along with robots TARS and CASE. That they do enter the wormhole and come out in a wholly different galaxy (the movie should have been called Intergalactic, right?) is not a spoiler. The trouble is that at least one of the three planet candidates is very close to a large black hole, ominously named Gargantua. What if this planet is the best alternative to Earth? Can't be safe to be so close to a black hole; luckily, the planet's mass is large enough to keep it from passing Gargantua's event horizon, so all is good. Well, good as I can make it without explaining what troubles Coop and crew run into, and that could ruin things for you, dear viewer.It's possible some will find this movie to be a little overplotted (yet too vague), with a surfeit of exposition to help things along. This is necessary in part, though, because of two different timelines - that of Coop in the far-off galaxy and that of Murph back on Earth itself. And this is because of a time slip that Coop encounters that slows time for him relative to Earth time, to the tune of one outer-space minute equaling several years on Earth.Admittedly, there were moments when I felt like I'd missed something - that's attributable to how quickly Nolan propels the plot and to how damnably loud the soundtrack is at times. Hans Zimmer's score is excellent, but clearly someone figured that turning it up to 11 was the way to go. I mean, why allow an intricate plot get in the way of booming, sweeping sounds? Also, like Kubrick's 2001, the final twenty minutes can be puzzling. There's not much more that can be said about this that won't reveal something important. I found it fascinating and satisfying and in keeping with the rest of the movie. Perhaps not all loose ends are tied up at the end, but I'm one of those who feels that's a good thing.Nolan's Interstellar is spectacle supported by solid science and a fertile imagination. If the Academy Awards included only five nominees for Best Picture, this film probably wouldn't make the cut - but it should be among the top ten for the year and thus earn such a nomination, along with some for sound and effects.",8,1,3,15 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A satisfying mixed bag
","Most of you who have even thought about watching this movie have seen some comments by critics. While it is a good idea to judge movies by your own standards, sometimes you can avoid stinkers by listening to what the critics specifically dislike and like. And, of course, if their dislikes are similar to yours, you can follow their lead.Here are comments from some critics, followed by my own assessment:1. The acting is horrible.This is true, somewhat. Of all of the lead actors, only Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) is at least passable; Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) and Natalie Portman (Senator Padme Amidala) are both pretty awful. McGregor seems to be playing Alec Guinness (who, of course, originated the role in 1977's Star Wars), and this has been perceived as a knock on him. Personally, I think it was the wise way to go. We all know that Obi-Wan dies in Star Wars (Episode IV), so what McGregor was trying to do was kind of morph into Guinness, to make it easier for us to take the transformation from McGregor in the upcoming Episode III to Guinness in Episode IV.
Christensen, at first glance, seems woefully miscast and overmatched. One of the knocks on him is that he just comes off as your typical teenager (in the movie, he's 15). The critics sometimes fail to remember that Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker in Star Wars was just as petulant and moody, so this is more of a character issue than an actor issue. However, Christensen's line readings are atrocious, and some of the writing of his character is banal. In one scene, for example, he rails against Obi-Wan to Senator Amidala - how he's underappreciated by Obi-Wan, how he doesn't get to do nuffin, and so on. Real fascinating stuff - not. And the scene drags on a bit too long, making the character move from gritty angst to just plain obnoxiousness. Of course, bear in mind that Anakin does grow up to be the evil Darth Vader, and the lad's fits of pique are George Lucas's way of showing us how he's already struggling with the Dark Side of the Force.Portman was excellent in Episode 1, but she's completely flat in this one. Sometimes people unfairly compare her character to Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Fisher brought spice to the character, whereas Portman brings a more regal attitude. Yes, she's a can-do Senator (formerly Queen, don't ask how). Bringing different things to the table is fine, but again - remember that Amidala will be Leia's mother, so some of the virtues found in Leia should appear, you would think, in Amidala (and in Anakin). In addition, the chemistry between Christensen and Portman is completely nonexistent. You'd find more sexual vibes between a nun and a eunuch. This is definitely the result of bad casting - your lovers HAVE to appear to love each other, and they were very unconvincing. I could see the audience wincing each time Anakin and Amidala began to talk in that low voice that's supposed to essay passion. Snore!Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Jedi Master Mace Windu, gets a much larger role here than he had in Episode I, and he even gets to kick ass, himself. Great to see Sam wielding a purple lightsaber! One of his generation's greatest actors - and is anyone saying he's slumming? Hell, no. Was Alec Guinness slumming? Or Peter Cushing? Or the indomitable Christopher Lee (interesting note: in the past several months, Lee has appeared in two of the highest-grossing films, both epics, Attack of the Clones and Lord of the Rings, playing characters that are disturbingly similar)? Sam Jackson rocks. He just plain rocks.2. It's poorly written.I can't agree with this assessment - I thought it was pretty well written. One benefit to seeing the first trilogy after the second is that we can see origins more clearly: If X happens in Episode II, we know that explains Y in Episode IV. I liked a lot of the little details - the beginnings of Boba Fett, for example. And if you look hard, you'll see Greedo from the first Star Wars in there, too.3. It's FX-driven.It sure is, and I'm glad it was. Now, when Star Wars came out, everyone was all agog over the effects, because there had never been anything like it before, and the movie showed a long-distant vision of the future. But here in 2003, we've seen a lot of space movies and a lot of not-so-special effects. The novelty's worn off a little, and we're not as enthralled. But don't get me wrong, the effects in this movie are excellent; they're just not unique anymore. (Still, as one critic noted, the ship that's bringing Amidala to the conference sounds like it's running on propellers... what's up with that??)Of course, in lieu of a million space fights, we get a lot of lightsaber-play. If you remember your Jedi history, all of the Jedi were wiped out during the Clone Wars (Obi-Wan explains this to Luke in Star Wars). This movie leads right up to those wars, and many of the Jedi in this movie don't make it through to the end. But man, while they're around - lots of great fights. In fact, the greatest Jedi of them all, Yoda, gets to kick ass, something that could never be done in 1977, or 1980, or 1983. In fact, the scene pitting Yoda against the evil Count Dooka (Christopher Lee) is magnificent, almost worth the admission on its own.At any rate, although the movie is loaded with effects, that's not the only reason we're watching. The truth is, many of us have bought into the mythos of Star Wars, and dammit, we care about these characters. And I think our curiosity about some things was satisfied by this movie.
One of the best indicators of a movie's quality is the feeling one gets as the movie concludes. Do you feel happy or satisfied? Good. Frustrated? Bad. Looking for more? Great. And that's where Attack of the Clones, despite its Grade-Z subtitle, succeeds magnificently. You want very much to find out what happens to the gang in Episode III. A movie can enjoy no higher praise than to leave its audience wanting more.",8,1,3,20 May 2002
Corpse Bride," Creepy and beautiful
","Tim Burton's work will probably never be described as banal or ordinary; rather, he is merely the poster child of inventive, creative cinematic storytelling. Corpse Bride is told using stop-action animation, but using more-advanced methods than those in Burton's legendary The Nightmare before Christmas.Victor (Johnny Depp) is a shy, clumsy groom to be who has trouble saying his vows during the wedding rehearsal. After flubbing his lines once too many times, he dashes into the Victorian night and practices them while walking along an icy, moonlit path. After Victor places the wedding ring on a nearby branch and recites his vows, a figure rises from the frozen ground - a corpse bride! The Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) thinks she's found her true love in Victor, and she spirits him to the Land of the Dead, populated by myriad dancing and talking skeletons. But Victor doesn't love The Bride and pines for his own lost bride, Victoria (Emily Watson). Complicating matters further is that their marriage was to be one of convenience, as Victoria's family needs the money that Victor's family might bring.The movie has many eye-popping (ha!) visuals, including the Bride's own eyeball, which seems to pop out every so often, and the sheathing and unsheathing of a long sword buried in the back of a skeleton made to resemble Napoleon Bonaparte (known as Bonesaparte in the credits). Wonderful musical numbers abound as well, featuring the beautiful voice of Danny Elfman - especially a complex jazz/scat number.It's really tough to find fault with any of the voices, which feature a number of former Burton collaborators, such as Depp, Elfman, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, and even Deep Roy, who played the Oompa Loompahs in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Although this film was up for a Best Animated Feature Oscar, don't think for a moment that your three-year-old is going to like it, musical numbers or not. The tone isn't as dark as Nightmare before Christmas, but the settings sure are. I mean, the movie takes place mostly at night, either in a dark forest, inside a dark, stark mansion, or the Land of the Dead. Not exactly the place you might find pastels and a lava lamp.Watching Corpse Bride, it's easy to forget it's not animated in the traditional way, or even the nouveau-artiste, computer way. Fourteen puppets of the Bride and of Victor were used in the making of this movie, and some 109,000 individual frames were filmed. The attention to detail is preposterously exquisite and should leave the average viewer properly dumbfounded.",8,0,1,22 March 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Compelling, tightly plotted Baby feels authentic
","Like its cousin Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone is based on a Dennis Lehane novel about an abduction. And like Mystic River, the novel - and the subsequent film - takes no predictable route to reach its conclusion and offers no easy answers to complicated problems. It doesn't just tug at your heartstrings, it snaps them in twain, reattaches them, and yanks them out again.The three-year-old daughter of Helene MacCready (Amy Ryan) has gone missing, and the child's aunt and uncle approach private detectives Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to help the police with the case. The detectives agree, albeit reluctantly, because a case of this scope and magnitude (including a lot of media attention) is a little beyond their purview.During his time on the case, Patrick makes discoveries he wish he hadn't made, and facing opposition from people he knows in the neighborhood, the police, and even his lover, Angie, he makes quick decisions with the best of intentions. Some of these decisions work out well, and others change his life for the worse, forever.The first thing that strikes you about this movie is how authentic everything feels, from the actors to the sets. The movie is set in a crime-ridden section of Boston, with plenty of working-class (and a lot of low-class) denizens with their almost stereotypically comic accents and coarse language. But although Affleck is a local boy, most of the cast isn't; this is, I believe, what they call acting. And, like Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, director Ben Affleck seems to have fully captured the desolate, desperate, and bitter lives of dishonest, disreputable people who often turn to crime and other shenanigans to get by in life. Affleck's Dorchester is unyielding, where hard people live.Another asset is the film's narrative thread. Although the story is told linearly, it's not easy to guess ahead of time what's coming. And it's not a product of the film's moving quickly, as some films do (a fast-paced film means less time for the moviegoer to spot holes in the plot), as there are realistic lulls around every scene's corner. At one point in the movie, with the benefit of watching it at home, I had to pause it quickly to assess the situation at hand, and I tried to predict where the movie was going. I was wrong. It's tightly plotted, but it's not unjustly or implausibly plotted, not in the least.Casey Affleck, who looks very much Ben's younger brother but apparently got all of the acting genes in the family, is superb as the conflicted but driven Patrick. His youthfulness notwithstanding (he's only 32), Affleck has the poise and guile of someone much older, a fact that's even noticed by other characters in the film. Faced with incredibly difficult decisions, Patrick has an unwavering sense of what is truly right, but he's never a single-minded, ignorant zealot who knows what he knows. At times during the case, Patrick's faith is shaken, and by the end of the movie he's not completely sure he's made the right decision. In other words, what you get at the end is not a neat, happy ending at all, a fact that shouldn't surprise those who have seen Mystic River.As the anguished (but loose) mother, Amy Ryan notched a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but my opinion is that it's not a nomination that's entirely deserved. Ryan is good, especially for a fairly inexperienced actress, but she's not so commanding or compelling as to warrant that sort of accolade. Faring about the same was the usually steady Morgan Freeman, who's okay here but whose role (and use as a plot device) is a bit underwritten.In fact, it's plain that this movie fails only where Mystic River succeeded so strongly; the former did not lapse into clichés, and Gone Baby Gone does. Although the movie generally presents plenty of plausible twists, some of the characters are rather predictable. The final resolution of the plot, in fact, seems almost too obvious in hindsight. Because of this, Gone Baby Gone just misses being a great movie, and instead it has to settle for being a pretty good film with an exhilarating performances from Casey Affleck and Ed Harris.",8,0,0,16 February 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," Boogeymen with a Conscience
","In the workaday world of monsters, Monsters, Inc. is the prime power provider.  The workers at the company get the energy by emerging from kids' closets and scaring the beejeezus out of them. The subsequent screams are then bottled and used to power Monstropolis.The company's top scarer is James P. Sullivan, aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman). His sidekick/best friend is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Here's how it works. Doors from kids' rooms appear from a giant warehouse in the company's behemoth building. The scarer opens the door and steps into the kid's bedroom and scares the heck out of the little tyke. As the screams come, they fill up empty canisters, the kind in which one might find helium for balloons, which the sidekick keeps at the ready. Then the monster steps out, the leaderboard reflects the changes (they're very competitive there, you know), and another door is procured. The sidekick takes care of all of the paperwork. But kids aren't getting scared the way they used to, and there's a power shortage afoot.There's one huge rule, though. Never come in contact with one of the kids, or any of the stuff from their rooms. The kids are toxic and will kill you on contact. (At one point, a particularly gruesome monster comes out of the room with a tiny sock velcroed to his fur; an emergency is declared, and a crack Kid Detection team races in to decontaminate the scene - and the monster, who gets quite a nasty shave. It's all innocuous enough, but it's also reflective of current events, although the movie was certainly written a while ago.)One evening, Sulley offers to do the paperwork so Mike can go on a date with his beloved Celia (Jennifer Tilly). There aren't supposed to be any doors left on the floor after hours, but there one is, and Sulley's just inquisitive enough to open it. Whoops! A kid comes out. Hilarity ensues. Sulley races to get Mike, and they both panic. I mean, think of it! A KID, there in Monstropolis! They fear for their lives! And of course all the while the kid, whom Sulley names Boo, is being a cute, adorable, curious little rugrat. This film was done by the Pixar people, the same nice folks who brought Toy Story and A Bug's Life to you. The animation is wonderful, although I'm not sure it's quite on par with Toy Story as far as the monsters go. The animation of the little girl, however, is fabulous. The animators must have kids of their own, because every nuance I can think of that a little kid would have was captured beautifully in this movie. The actors providing the voices are a lot of fun, too. Whoever cast John Goodman and Billy Crystal is probably suffering from a dislocated shoulder from patting themselves on the back so much. The two stars have great chemistry, bordering on Laurel and Hardy-ish.This is a bellyacher of a film, although admittedly it's not one that the intellectual snob would particularly enjoy. While the audience is the teeter-totter set, there is no overabundance of flatulence jokes - in fact, there aren't any. This is good clean (literally) fun.",8,0,1,29 November 2001
Captain America: The First Avenger," Nazis. I hate these guys.
","I admit that I don't know what to make of this, that there's been a run of comic-book movies that have managed to be plausible and thrilling, not cheap knockoffs rushed out to exploit a fad. Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the former. It features a terrific performance by Chis Evans as the Cap, a modicum of special effects and CGI, a slimy villain played by Hugo Weaving, and the famous backdrop of World War II. So help me, I found myself liking the movie despite my preconceptions.Steve Rogers (Evans) is a spindly, sickly young man who's full of desire to go fight those dastardly Nazis, but he's just too frail for the military, so he's classified 4F. Several times, in fact, under different names. A mysterious scientist named Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recruits Rogers to be part of a secret project: he'll inject Rogers' major organs and arteries with a new serum that will turn him into a super soldier. The military, represented by Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), and the CIA, represented by Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) are very interested in the results. Well, the results aren't too good, as the Nazis grab the serum and prevent anyone from making more super soldiers. But at least the US has Rogers, right? He's now super strong, fast, and agile.But one man is not an army, so instead of leading troops to victory Rogers is instead hired as a sort of USO cheerleader for war bonds. Yep, seriously. But you can't keep the good Captain down for long, and soon he is indeed leading some crazy mission to rescue his best friend Bucky and assorted Allied troops while also looking out for the nefarious Red Skull, head of Hitler's science division.It's well cast. Evans is believable as both the skinny Rogers and the pumped-up Captain America. He's earnest without seeming to take himself or the movie too seriously. Tucci, Jones, Weaving and newcomer Atwell are top notch as well.Even bearing in mind that this movie is merely a setup for the big Avengers film coming out soon (as were other movies, like Iron Man, Thor, and The Hulk), one can easily lose oneself in the great old-time action-adventure feel this one has, reminiscent of 1991's The Rocketeer. You have mad scientists, mythical technology, Nazis, all-American good guys, lots of neat guns. It's not a loud bore like Transformers, and the action scenes are well staged, as are the pyrotechnics. Throw in a believable plot (at least in the realm of comic-book movies), and this one's above average for the genre. I've probably said this before about other movies, but this is definitely one that's what a comic-book movie should be - daring, easy to follow, full of pulse-pounding action, and human.",7,3,5,4 April 2012
Incendies," Nowadays, it'd be a Best Picture nominee
","Blown away by this one. Grown twins are tasked by their late mom, as part of her will, to track down their real father and their heretofore-unknown older brother. The trail leads to an unnamed Middle Eastern country. Early Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) is just masterful; I particularly loved the technique of focusing on a character's face as they experience what is happening around them. Doing so gives us a chance to read their emotions of the moment. Strong acting, and a twist ending that I for sure never saw coming.",9,1,1,8 February 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," Best of the series, but that's not saying much
","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), or whoever he is, continues to be on the run from the police, innocent people, the CIA, and the world at large. He's scared, he's frustrated, and he's in mourning, since losing his beloved Marie (whom he met in the first Bourne movie and who died in the second). Bourne's put together a little bit of his past, after killing scores of people with skills he didn't know he had, but now a British reporter has published a series of articles about Bourne - and they seem to contain a lot more detail than an outsider would have. This sets the plot in motion, as Bourne's flushed out into the open in London, and the CIA battles with itself to either bring him in or shoot him dead like a dog.You can see the frustration build on Damon's increasingly creased face; he's looking older, weathered, beaten down - although Bourne can still disarm two strong bastards quick like a bunny rabbit. Jason Bourne doesn't have much to go on regarding his former life, but he's able to grasp at a couple of loose threads and weave a comfy blanket out of them. That sort of sums up this movie, really - it's a comfy blanket that doesn't go overboard in trying to wow the viewer while avoiding the appearance of stagnation. Damon has grown rather well into the lead - ironically, he looks a hell of a lot more believable here than he did as Edward Wilson in the recent The Good Shepherd. Damon's grim and determined but not robotic; he appears to be a couple of steps ahead of the audience, anyway, and that's what's important.Helping Damon out is an excellent supporting cast. Joan Allen is back as CIA operative Pamela Landy and manages to look tough while not looking bitchy. Great job, Joan! David Strathairn joins the cast as CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen, with an aging Scott Glenn as the agency's director. Turns out Strathairn (who's also a fantastic actor - see him in Good Night, and Good Luck, for example) and Allen have tremendous chemistry together; their in-office battles could have come off as just histrionics, but both actors use steely glares in lieu of angsty shouting. When these two were on screen, the tension was palpably thick, and you were always wondering if the characters had ulterior motives in how they want to deal with Bourne.Also back is Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons; her scenes with Damon far supersede those he had with Franka Potente in the first two Bourne films. So much is said with a flit of the eyes, with a curl of a lip. We aren't beat over the head with Nicky's motivations - in fact, they're left rather vague, which is good - and neither she nor Bourne behaves quite as predicted when they're interacting.I wasn't a huge fan of the first in the series (The Bourne Identity), and I felt that the second (The Bourne Supremacy) was a little bit better. This one, purportedly the last of them, is the best of the lot, although that's perhaps damning with faint praise. One trouble is that there are plot holes that you can drive a car through. Another is that when director Paul Greengrass wants to film an action scene, he makes sure no cut lasts more than a half-second, else your brain would be able to follow what's going on. It's extremely chaotic, intended to convey the sense of how a real fistfight or car crash would appear, but still - I don't need the scenes to be so realistic that I get a headache from watching them. This is supposed to be fun for me! A favorite dumb moment - Bourne's involved in a high-speed chase that culminates with his car hitting a parked car and then getting slammed by the chasing car, from behind. Bourne, of course, exits his car with a few scratches, although the guy who slammed INTO him dies while slumped over his car. Makes little sense. Sure, we need to see violent crashes - it's the American way! - but c'mon. No injuries? Heck, at least Bruce Willis limped a bit in the new Die Hard movie.And finally, although this is alleged to be the last of the Bournes, it's all left rather open ended. Which is a shame, really; at the end, you'll notice there's a great chance to finish the series definitively without making it seem too pat. And the filmmakers passed this up, presumably to ensure they could have another shot at making millions more dollars.",7,2,5,5 August 2007
The Aviator," Bad Leo, strong supporting cast
","Martin Scorcese's lengthy homage to Howard Hughes is alternately gripping and aloof and unfortunately is forced to rely far too much on the dubious acting talents of its lead, Leonardo DiCaprio. As Hughes, the perpetually cherubic DiCaprio simply doesn't have enough panache for the role, and the sometimes-garish makeup that's intended to show Hughes' aging merely accentuates DiCaprio's anachronistic performance.The movie spans a few decades in Hughes' heyday, from the 1920s to the 1940s, from his beginnings as producer/director of Hell's Angels to his appearance before a Senate investigatorial committee. Hughes fights with everyone - Hollywood censors, the starlets he dated, his employees, the U.S. government, and rival airline tycoons, sometimes to the benefit of Hughes' myriad business interests, and more often to their debit. The film largely deals with Hughes' involvement in films and in the airline business, choosing to gloss over or ignore entirely his casinos in Las Vegas and the years leading up to his death in 1976.At the crux of things, though, are Hughes the Film Producer and Hughes the Aviation Pioneer. From his long-delayed Hell's Angels - which made him a national star - to his mammary-obsessed The Outlaw, The Aviator shows how single-minded Hughes was in his relentless pursuit of the Perfect Movie. Because he was independently wealthy and could lean on his own funds to keep production moving, Hughes worked outside the traditional Hollywood studio system, shaping Hollywood to fit his own ideas and methods. Not everything worked - and not every idea was well received - but Hughes remained a man unwilling to compromise his principles; some might call this 'stubbornness.' Juxtaposed with Hughes' film travails is his constant drive to improve aviation, from the purchase of what would become TWA to the innovative behemoth Spruce Goose, which unfortunately flew a distance of one mile exactly one time. Hughes is shown as a notorious perfectionist, personally inspecting each new aircraft to see that it met his (unspecified) standards.At 170 minutes long, The Aviator manages to cram in many useful and interesting tidbits about Hughes' life and times, and even though certain aspects of his personality were omitted (such as his alleged aversion to African Americans), one doesn't get the sense that something's missing. This is a credit to the screenwriter, John Logan, although the runtime didn't hurt.As is usually the case with DiCaprio movies, the biggest liability in the movie was Leonard DiCaprio himself. As Hughes gets older in the movie, poor Leo looks exactly the same - and worse, acts exactly the same. Even when he's not laden with makeup, DiCaprio looks like he's about 12 years old and facing the real world for the first time. In The Aviator, he has the gravitas of an empty suit, never appearing to be more than, perhaps, the son of Howard Hughes. DiCaprio isn't terrible in the movie, he's just not terribly believable.His supporting cast is pretty good, though, especially John C. Reilly as his number-two guy and all-around abuse receiver, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, and Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, the head of Hughes' rival in air, Pan Am. When you have strong professional performances like the work these people turned in, the movie can suffer an underwhelming lead. Unfortunately, one of the key supporting roles wasn't quite as fulfilling as it should have been - that of Katharine Hepburn, played quirkily by Cate Blanchett. Blanchett adopted Hepburn's idiosyncrasies and personality tics as well as her odd, off-putting stuttering vocal delivery. Now, I'm not saying the real Katharine Hepburn wasn't exactly as Blanchett portrayed her, but her mannerisms were so over the top that they were distracting and annoying. Blanchett won an Oscar for her performance; I believe a Razzie would have been more suitable.The movie's not much more than an interesting glimpse at a long-dead icon until it reaches the Senate hearings chaired by Senator Brewster (Alan Alda, who also garnered an Oscar nomination). Here especially, Hughes' strength really shows through, although a present-day viewer might wonder how much of the hearings proceeded exactly as depicted in this movie. Alda, by the way, is fine - although I kept seeing those usual Alda mannerisms, which made me think of Hawkeye Pierce instead of a bad-guy politico.Overall, The Aviator isn't quite the epic it wanted to be, and although it's well paced and benefits from fine supporting performances, it does suffer from an unworthy lead performance.",6,2,4,6 July 2005
Oblivion," Fascinating, visual delight
","A man on a workaday mission in a post-apocalyptic Earth discovers secrets about his home planet - and himself. He comes to realize he's just a simple pawn, that he's been set up. He is, at times, on the run from those who had employed him. If you guessed that maybe this was a Tom Cruise movie, you'd be right. Poor old Tom is always getting set up and having to figure out what's what. But, like his earlier Minority Report, Cruise's latest sci-fi is a lot of fun, beautifully shot and tightly plotted.It's the future, sometime, I forget when. Giant bugs invaded Earth. We kicked their butts with nukes, thus rendering almost the entire planet unlivable. Those who survived the war were shuttled off to eventually settle on Jupiter's moon Titan. Meanwhile, drones are set up in low Earth orbit to monitor and destroy any surviving bad guys, known as Scavs. You know, short for scavengers. Nothing grows. It's a big ol' wasteland, this planet. Jack Harper (Cruise) is a soldier who has the task of being the clean-up crew; he and his colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are in charge of monitoring the drones and the extraction machines that are removing water from Earth's surface to bring it to a huge space station called the Tet, humanity's escape vessel. All Jack has to do each day is check on the drones, fly around in a funny looking ship, and blast away the occasional Scav while ensuring that the rigs gulping down the water are still operational. The Earth at this point is divided into at least two zones: inhabitable (kind of) and radioactive. The rigs are working in the former area, trying to squeeze all they can out of the planet before Jack and Victoria have to head up to the Tet - in two weeks' time. But something funny is going on, down there on Earth. A simple recon mission to check out a rig leads Jack to believe he's not alone down there, and the truth - well, the first truth is shocking enough to him (he's been there a long time, though he has almost no memory of a time before the War), and the second is a stunner to the nth degree. Certainly, to give more information would spoil the film for you. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Tom Cruise movie in which there was a surprise of some sort. And his acting was better than usual, too - he's human, not a cardboard monkey playing dress up. When confronted with the truth, he's as befuddled as we are, which is unusual for a Tom Cruise character; they typically Know It All and Save the Day. Not so sure that's the case here.His Jack also shows quite a bit of depth. We get glimpses of his past, through his own fractured memories. He can't shake them. He dreams about things that seem familiar and yet unknowable. He is introspective and cocky. He is daring, yet unsure. He is human.Morgan Freeman shows up in a role that cannot be explicated here except to say that he's Morgan Freeman. Melissa Leo is Sally, the commander of the Tet who checks in with Jack and Victoria every day to see how those rigs are a-comin' along (Southern accent). Both are excellent as always.I came away from Oblivion with a strong sense of satisfaction. The ending feels right; it's not contrived, it's not forced, it's not really Hollywood. That's not to say this isn't a feel-good movie, because in many ways it is. Just not the way you'd expect from the beginning of the film.",7,0,1,2 May 2013
American Pie," Raunch was never this cool!
","You know, when I was a lad in the eighties, the big deal for us teens was Porky's (and its two sequels). In that film, set in Florida in the 1950s, a group of horny high school kids tries their very best to lose their individual virginity as soon as possible.You can consider American Pie an update of Porky's, except that it's a LOT funnier while still retaining all of that raunch. The hook for Porky's was that you got to see a little nudity, which was a big deal to a teenager in the early eighties. Pie surpasses the raunch and adds dollops of good, solid, vivid, and (especially) authentic characterizations. While the kids in Porky's were fairly stereotypical, the kids in Pie are.... well, typical, really. Of course, some things never change, and the driving force of the story in Pie is that males just wanna get laid, while females want it to be just right. The movie also tackles such issues as true love, masturbation (male and female), pornography, sex toys, orgasms (male and female), older women, and even diarrhea! Quite a lot to cram into 90 minutes, but not only does the film not skip a beat while delivering these goods, it does so with such honesty that you'll very rarely see in a so-called teen film of the late nineties. And I'm pretty sure it's the only film ever to tackle the all-important issue of sex with pastry!(Side note: Good to see Thomas Ian Nicholas, from Rookie of the Year, a little more grown up - so to speak!)",8,0,0,9 January 2000
Watchmen," Outstanding!
","An ex-superhero is thrown through a plate glass window, many stories above the city. Was his murder somehow connected to the feared imminent nuclear holocaust between the United States and Russia? Someone seems to want the former do-gooders out of the way in this thrilling, one-of-a-kind, jaded look at superheroes that turns conventional comic-book wisdom on its head.It's an alternate 1985. Richard Nixon has been elected to a fifth presidential term. But the USSR is encroaching on Afghanistan, and the US isn't taking too kindly to it. Enter the smartest man in the world, Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), formerly known as superhero Ozymandias, who is working with the ethereal Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a physicist who has achieved immortality and near-omniscience owing to a long-ago lab mishap. With Dr. Manhattan's help, Adrian hopes to dissolve the tension between the two superpowers.But that's not the only conflict, not by a long shot. Since the characters here are unfamiliar to most audiences, there's plenty of backstory, seamlessly edited into the main story as important details that inform the characters. (For one thing, we get to see the rather graphic - more on that later - origin of Dr. Manhattan.) The superheroes have conflict within their own group, which has gone its separate ways - with different goals and outlooks. Not only that, but the world at large isn't entirely on the side of masked avengers, labeling them as vigilantes. By the present, most of them have ditched their costumes for traditional lives; some tinker with their gadgets in their basements, in hiding, and some merely blend into society.Here's who's left in 1985, in addition to Ozymandias (who's revealed his true identity to the world) and Dr. Manhattan: Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Others have gone insane or been murdered themselves in years past; all suffer as everyday humans now.So how does Watchmen skewer comic-book tropes? Well, they're not always good, you see. Some are, but some maliciously kill, albeit for the greater good. Some take delight in the suffering of man if that man is, say, a child killer. That sort of thing. The truth is, no one here is perfect, not even the superheroes. Another difference is the high level of violence in the movie. This isn't a comic-book movie where the bad guys fall down when they get slapped, no sir. No, the heroes beat the stuffing out of them, with blood, entrails, and the like splattering all over the place. Limbs are dislodged, brains are exposed. It's wildly violent, much like director Zack Snyder's last film, 300, but without the detached, this-can't-be-real tone. This isn't a movie in which the bad guys are brought in for questioning or sent to prison to think about what they've done. This is a movie in which the bad guys are annihilated, period.In case you're still contemplating taking the kiddies to see this superhero fare, here's another caveat: there's nudity. No, it's not Malin Akerman (although you do get a glimpse), it's the blue-hued Dr. Manhattan himself. Sometimes he's in a thong, but often he's just letting it all dangle there. Funny thing is, it's not really all that shocking. If it'd been one of the humans, perhaps, but Dr. Manhattan is more humanoid than human at this point.At 160 minutes, the action really doesn't let up. But that's nothing - most movies are fast paced now. This one has a plot that can keep up with the action. In fact, the intricacies of the plot are delicious to unwrap; this was not a movie - superhero or not - where you can predict the end without just taking a wild stab.I can't understate how tremendous an achievement this movie is. If we're all lucky, this will open the door for more adult comic-book films. The good guys don't always have to be about justice and truth and all that junk, and the bad guys can sometimes get what's really coming to them. I do want to point out that among the outstanding cast, Jackie Earle Haley as the haunted, masked Rorschach is tremendous. Wilson, who appeared with Haley in Little Children a few years back, is also dweebishly strong as the aging Nite Owl II.",9,353,602,2 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Still-Bourne
","Matt Damon stars as a young man found floating in the middle of the ocean by some French fisherman. He has no memory of who he is, but he does have a weird computer chip implanted in his hip and two bullets in his back. The chip contains a number of an account in Zurich, and there he finds a safety-deposit box with multiple passports, a lot of money, and a gun.
The young man chooses the identity of Jason Bourne from the box. But who is Jason Bourne? The money and the IDs, along with his supersonic reflexes and hand-to-hand fighting skills, seem to indicate that he's not your typical car salesman. For whom does Bourne work? Is he an assassin? A good guy? A bad guy? And who's following him, anyway? Bourne hightails it out of Zurich, heading to Paris in the company of Marie (Franka Potente), who accepts his offer of $10,000 to drive him (and another $10,000 when they get there). And of the course of the bulk of the movie, Bourne tries to reconstruct his life - and his identities.
The movie is based on a Robert Ludlum potboiler thriller, and was made into a TV movie in 1988, with Richard Chamberlain as Jason Bourne. Having not read the book yet, I had no real expectations of the movie. Matt Damon, however, did strike me as a little too young for the role. He's a good actor, and this is a good role for him to work on his acting chops, but he just didn't do it for me in this movie. Damon can be appealing at times, but he's still relatively early in his career, and just not the heavyweight that this role seemed to demand. He seemed very unsure of himself (although, of course, Bourne's very unsure, not knowing who he is or what he's become), veering at times from strong-willed action hero to puzzled milquetoast. As Marie, Potente isn't half bad - she's actually very good, and she gets better as the movie progresses. She's a wanderer without a real home, much like Bourne, and Potente does a fine job of essaying her character's change from someone being forced on a mission to a faithful sidekick, of sorts.
Another problem is the lack of chemistry between Damon and Potente. The scenes they shared - and there were plenty - should have been sizzling, but they pretty much died in terms of chemistry. Luckily, there was plenty of action surrounding them to make up for this failing. The worst problem, however, was the directing itself. Doug Liman (Swingers) is a pretty good director, but this was his first shot at a spy thriller. Too bad he dropped the ball - the pacing is absolutely leaden throughout much of the film. Either a lot of things were happening - which can be good, as it disguises plot holes - or nothing was happening. If providing a sense of atmosphere was the goal, the film did not succeed. The writing itself was pretty crisp, although the characters were a little flat (and, aside from the two leads, they were caricatures, including Cooper's Machiavellian bad guy). The explosions and car chases were great, but that's become the norm for these films.",5,1,2,1 July 2002
Justice League," Justice League gets DC back on track, finally
","It's a low bar to clear, but Justice League is way better than Batman v. Superman. It's funnier, it has more action, it has less brooding and darkness, and it's just plain much, much more fun to watch. Justice League is the kind of movie that should put DC back on the same sort of cinematic path that Marvel has been treading over the past decade.The movie picks up where the aforementioned Batman v. Superman left off. Superman is gone, having sacrificed himself to save the world. Meanwhile, Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) begin to recruit an alliance of super-duper people (Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa)) to prepare for what appears to be another alien threat.That alien threat is one Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), the nephew and second-in-command to the yet-unseen super big bad named Darkseid. Steppenwolf has arrived on Earth to collect three Mother boxes – objects that, when joined together, will grant immense power, etc., etc., etc. Steppenwolf is aided by thousands and thousands of Parademons, bug-like creatures who were once men.Here's a brief list of what I liked about the movie. 1) Bruce Wayne has a wry, understated sense of humor that – get this – is also self-deprecating. 2) Jason Momoa kills as a manly-man king of the seas. 3) Gal Gadot is just as terrific as she was in her own movie and in BvS. 4) The Flash is hilarious! 5) There were plenty of tight action sequences that, despite being shown in IMAX, were easy to track. I could see who was fighting whom and with what! The overall tone of the movie is more in line with what Marvel's doing – there's physical fighting, there are biting remarks, there are doubts (our heroes are human-ish, after all), there are touching moments. Everyone delivers, which isn't always the case in ensemble pictures, but Affleck in particular really stepped up his game as the Bat dude. A lot of people liked his performance in BvS, but I found him stiff and boring. That's just not true in Justice League. Bats still has a huge ego, still likes to run things, likes to work alone even among his team. And he's still kind of a jerk. But he's not a boring jerk; Affleck, finally, gives him a personality! And lo! DC was saved!",7,1,3,20 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Both hit AND myth
","Watching Lord of the Rings is at once a mesmerizing and fascinating experience. Even if you've never read any of the books, the story is woven in such a delicious, viewer-friendly manner that even the most curmudgeonly of us will appreciate the tale.The Lord of the Rings trilogy (actually four books, if you include the prequel The Hobbit) tells the tale of the quest to return an all-powerful (and all-evil) ring to the fire from whence it was forged in an effort to destroy it forever. J. R. R. Tolkien's books are very rich with detail, particularly with historical detail. The world of Middle earth is populated by all sorts of creatures, and man is not yet the dominating species. In Tolkien's world, sorcery, might, and pastoral settings all exist  together, albeit not always in perfect harmony. The first several minutes of the 178-minute movie (subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring, the title of the first book in the series) describes the terrible history of the One Ring. If someone had not read the books, it might be difficult for them to comprehend the story; thankfully, the startling special effects and brisk storytelling make it all worthwhile and informative.In short, here's how the tale unfolds. Back in the old days, the ultimate evil being Sauron forged a series of powerful rings. Some he gave to the Elvish race (known for their wisdom). Some he gave to Men. Some he gave to Dwarves (known for their strength and courage). But there was one Ring that was designed to bind all of the others together, to be as strong as all the others combined. With this ring, one could rule all of Middle Earth. But the evil Sauron was defeated by Men, and his hand (well, the hand of his physical being) was chopped off; a Man recovered the Ring, but fell prey to its power. The Ring eventually sunk to the bottom of a river, where it was recovered by an eerie creature named Gollum, who also fell prey to its allure. And from this creature, the tiny Hobbit Bilbo Baggins acquired the Ring, not knowing its power and keeping it to himself for 60 years. Bilbo gives the Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins.When the Ring's existence is confirmed, a meeting involving all of the creatures of Middle Earth is convened in the Elvish home of Elron, the lord of the Elves. It is decided that the Ring must be returned to the peak of Mount Doom, where it must then be cast into the fires that made it (and where it can be unmade). Frodo volunteers for the horrible task, and representatives from each of the major species in Middle Earth are assembled to aid him in his quest: Aragorn and Boromir from the land of Men; Leglolas the Elf; Gimli the Dwarf; Gandalf the wizard; and the Hobbits, Frodo, Samwise, Peregrin, and Merry. These nine are chosen to travel the great distance to the land of evil, and cast the ring back.Quite a daunting task, isn't it? And while all of this is going on, the evil of Sauron is aware that the Ring exists, and he is preparing his armies for his own quest - recover the Ring at all costs. Luckily, the good guys have some all-stars on their side. Gandalf (played very memorably by Ian McKellen) is more than just a circus magician - he's one of the most powerful wizards in history (that's not common knowledge at the outset, at least not to the naive Hobbits, but it's apparent rather quickly). Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is more than a mere Ranger, he's also of noble blood, and has the courage of a thousand lions. These two leaders are the soul and minds of the Fellowship. But the story's focus is on the tiny Ringbearer, Frodo. You see, carrying this ring isn't quite the same as, for example, carrying a wedding ring up the aisle to the about-to-be-wed. Frodo is drawn to the ring but still has such amazing inner strength that he can stick to his mission. He knows its power, and as he gets closer and closer to Mount Doom the pressure of carrying the jewelry is absolutely overwhelming. It's as if you or I walked around the office carrying a Volkswagen.Besides the story, there are two other intangible stars at work here: the special effects and the makeup/costumery. There's one particular scene in which Gandalf rides a giant bird (an eagle, perhaps) to safety. My mind immediately assumed this could happen; but upon reflection I believe that this was wizardry of another time, another example of the magnificence of special effects. Some of the scenes are absolutely jaw-dropping. The Fellowship must travel through the Mines of Moria; they tackle the precipice of a giant snow-covered mountain; they hike over marshes and through forests. And at no point does one think that all of this is make-believe.Another asset is the cinematography. Gandalf is a human, although a tall one in the books. The Hobbits are halflings, or little people - they're much smaller than humans. Their homes are smaller, and Gandalf has to duck to enter. But side by side, Gandalf and Bilbo look exactly as they should - Gandalf perhaps six feet tall, and Bilbo perhaps four. Not bad when you consider both roles are played by grown men (Bilbo is played by Ian Bannen)!
And the acting! Mortensen as Aragon! John Rhys-Davies as Gimli the Dwarf! The great Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, a fellow wizard of Gandalf! Sean Bean as Boromir!  And the actresses are even better. Liv Tyler as Arwen the elf and Cate Blanchett as the Lady Galadriel are absolutely stunning. These are not just beautiful women playing ethereal roles; their screen presence is off the charts. The only downside to the acting is Elijah Wood as Frodo. Throughout the movie, he looked like a deer caught in headlights, constantly stunned and shocked. Wood's never been a particularly good actor, and his limitations are unfortunately readily amplified by this major role. But he's not horribly miscast, either. Most of the time, the action in the movie is so intense you forget what a dull performance he's turning in.
I've read all of the books, so of course I knew what to expect here. The friend I went to the movie with had not read the books, so I asked her if she found it boring, uninteresting, or confusing. She answered in the negative, surprising considering the length of the film. But here's something you can expect, if you've not read these wonderful books. There are three books, of course, and the other two movies have been filmed already. The ending of this film does not tie everything up neatly (as the first book did not). The filmmakers faced a very difficult task in ending the movie, and they chose to stick with the book's ending (which I certainly will not reveal here). But please, if you watch this film, realize there are two more to come, and that the ending of this is also the beginning to the next one. There are plenty of intense scenes in the movie, probably too intense for very young kids. This is NOT a children's story (the books certainly weren't, either), although it's one that can be enjoyed by all. If I had kids, I would be reading these books to them as often as possible. This is epic storytelling at its absolute best. There is never a slow moment in the movie (or the books). The movie is a masterpiece, one of the finest examples of moviemaking we've seen in a long, long time.",9,0,1,3 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Revolving dung
","Did you hear that massive thud just now? That was the Matrix trilogy hitting a giant brick wall.I don't want to say that the latest the last installment, Revolutions, is bad, but I hear dentists recently rejected the idea of the movie playing in their waiting rooms because they felt it would drive away their patients.Revolutions isn't mind-numbingly awful, though. It's a laugh riot. The trouble is, the Wachowski brothers (who cowrote and codirected) forgot to add any jokes.When last we left our intrepid, patchwork band of rebels fighting those evil machines that run the Matrix, Neo (Keanu Reeves) was somewhere between the machine world and the real world. Oh, and some guy who apparently was sent to kill him was in a coma.Meanwhile, the machines are drilling down to the last outpost of real humanity, the deep-underground city known as Zion, where people have come from all cultures (and, judging from the look of their executive council, all hairstyles as well), people who simultaneously raise their hands either to express defiance or because they're testing a new underarm deodorant. You know these people. They're dirty and yet so pure.It's up to Neo, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to figure out how to stop the machines, who are led by Sentinels, mosquito-like drones that you just can't swat. Aiding them in their quest is The Oracle, the mystical - if slightly dowdy - psychic played by Mary Alice. Like most of the people in the movie, The Oracle speaks in riddles. But don't worry about understanding her cryptic responses - there's killin' to be done!And what killing! One scene - the attack of Zion by the machines - takes forever. (I didn't have a watch in the cold, cold theater, but I could have read it by the bright green EXIT sign behind me. A sign that, by the way, looked awfully inviting.) It seems like an entire hour of the two-hour movie is devoted to these things breaking through the outer hull of the underground city and kicking butt. The trouble is, the action moves soquick, it's often tough for the normal human eye to discern who is shooting at whom. It's just madness, utter chaos without any sort of perspective. In short, it's an absolute mess.(One of the weapons the humans use in their defense are these giant Transformers-like robots into which the human straps himself - males only; sorry, ladies! - and maneuvers the arms to fire machine guns. But what's the point? The humans themselves are completely vulnerable - they don't even warrant a plastic shield!)In this movie, we see a few familiar characters from the first two movies. There seems to be no need for them - except for The Oracle - other than to complicate the plot. Which is quite odd, because the entire plot itself takes only 30 minutes or so to play out - the rest is sound and fury.Some of the dialog - no, make that most - is astoundingly poor. Take that lengthy battle scene, for instance. It's as if the Wachowskis were channeling a screenwriter from old Republic Pictures, the low-budget outfit that produced scads of John Wayne war movies. Nearly every cliche shows up in this one, from the goofy young soldier who screws up but just somehow manages to help save the day to the two soldiers on the run from the machine, with one mowed down while the other just escapes. (I expected a 'no.. go on.. beat those machines!' before the soldier died.)Here's how it breaks down, folks. The first Matrix was wonderful in its mysticism; it was more than bombs burstin' in the air. It was philosophical and quite mysterious. The second one lost a bit of that but still tossed a few curveballs our way.But the third one? Try no mysticism and some of the poorest action scenes in recorded history.",2,0,0,10 November 2003
28 Weeks Later," Sad, played out, tiresome
","It's seven months after the outbreak of the rage virus in London, and it appears that the disease has been eradicated. American troops are stationed throughout the city, which is now being repopulated. Among the new/old citizens are two children, the first minors to reenter the city. London is now a dystopia, much as it was in the similarly themed Children of Men, in which mistrust runs high and the government and military seem more antagonistic than beneficial.It's all safe, say the American soldiers. Mission accomplished, and all that. It's safe to come back in. A dedicated military doctor wonders why the newest repatriates include children - 'What if it comes back?' she wonders. 'Then we kill it,' she's told. I immediately felt safer.Of course, the virus IS back, else there'd be no movie. In a prologue, a small band of survivors holes up in a secluded country cottage. When one answers the door to find an uninfected child, all hell breaks loose, culminating in one man's decision to abandon his wife to the clutches of a rage-infested undead mob.That man, Don (Robert Carlyle), is the father of the two new young arrivals to London, and now he has to explain how their mother died. Being the kind to spare his kids nightmares and to avoid probing questions, he fudges the truth a bit. Next thing you know, the kids are scampering across the Thames to visit their old home, against the express orders of the military, which deems most of London to be very unsafe, rife with disease and pestilence and the like. These are not smart kids.You can see where this is going. The rage virus makes its return, spreading extremely quickly from person to person, and suddenly it's a race against time to get the kids out of London. Now, in all honesty, there's a good reason they have to make it out of the city, other than preserving their own lives, but I won't spoil it here - I point this out merely to show that there is, indeed, a logical reason to hold their lives as more valuable than those of the adults around them.But the trouble with 28 Weeks Later is that it's largely uninvolving, boring crap. The people, except for that Army doctor (Rose Byrne) and an intrepid, ethical soldier (Jeremy Renner), are largely stupid. And I don't mean just that they're all one-dimensional characters, it's that they do dumb things that cause all sorts of mayhem to rain upon them. Things like hugging a woman who may carry the rage disease. Or kissing a woman who may carry the rage disease. Breaking into a security facility to do the latter. That sort of thing. Dumb, dumb, dumb.The second problem with the movie is that there aren't nearly enough zombie attacks. There are some, sure, but they're isolated and feel mighty stagy. Compare the scene in which the doctor and her charges attempt to get out of the city by car with the one in Children of Men in which Clive Owen attempts to escort the first pregnant woman in a generation out of the city. In one, you know the characters will run into a series of obstacles that they'll likely overcome, but in the other, there's no certainty at all - anything could happen.The third problem is that much of the movie's action scenes feel as if they're part of a really bad music video. I'm talking choppy editing with quick, dizzying cuts - this is not a movie for those suffering from vertigo or epilepsy. The action moves so quickly that I literally could not tell what was happening, which can hardly be the point. It reminded me of being in the middle of Space Mountain at Walt Disney World. I saw flashing lights and heard screams, but that was about it. Just poor, poor editing and cinematography.If this was supposed to be a commentary on the dangers of a having the military run a city, whoopee doo - we've seen this kind of junk before. I get it: military bad, citizens good. This movie ups the ante a little bit by actually firebombing London, a sort of Blitz II, but the effect would be the same if I were playing the old Nintendo video game Contra. Because the outbreak's so bad, you see, the soldiers are ordered to waste everyone they see. Everyone's a target. Including, apparently, the audience.28 Weeks Later isn't just bad in the sense that most sequels are bad, it's bad in the sense that it manages to replay all clichés about dystopian societies, and End Days plagues, and so forth without giving us the goods of zombie attacks, which is what we came for.",4,3,8,13 May 2007
Cast Away," No Tom is an island
","Watch the ads for Robert Zemeckis' new movie and you'd think that this is a movie about a man stranded on a deserted island, a la Robinson Crusoe. So did I, but Tom Hanks' character doesn't wind up on the island until a good 20 minutes of filler material have been used. Filler material, in most movies, is the kind of plot information that seems superfluous at first but is later tied into the plot itself. So we're 20 minutes into a movie and finally see Chuck Noland (Hanks) on the island. You can see where this review is headed, can't you? First off, there's the title. Cast Away? Why not Castaway? Why make it into two words? A puzzlement, to be sure. I know, I know... nitpicking! No, it's not! If it's two words, it says to me someone has been cast away - but Chuck hasn't been cast away, he's been marooned. Maybe the makers didn't want anyone to confuse it with the Survivor TV show. I think they should have gone with the one-word title, but hey - that's just me.The movie is a little over two hours long, and in the bulk of that time we follow Chuck's exploits on the island. We see his trials, his failures, his successes, and his thought processes. And it all really is mesmerizing, as long as you suspend some of your logic processes. This happens with a lot of action/adventure type movies, because the focus is on what's happening, not why it's happening. Sometimes you'll see an illogical chain of events in an action movie, and you'll dismiss it because you're there to see the action, not to be bothered with the plot. Well, friends, I am bothered by it! I wondered how Chuck survived the plane crash and why he got out what looked like everything in his pocket just before the plane hit turbulence but once the trouble started he only grabbed his precious pocket watch. I wondered if I was watching a long commercial for Federal Express (see how many logos you can spot). I've seen some people say this is one of the top movies of the year. Sorry, I can't see that. It's fun to watch, but the compelling stuff in the middle is surrounded by a beginning and an end that slow down the pacing of the film immeasurably. Sure, I care about Chuck's beau Kelly (Helen Hunt), and I know that setting up their relationship at the outset is somewhat important. But it's more than a little contrived when his last words to her before jumping on the plane are 'I'll be right back.' Come on! All of the supporting plot surrounding his adventures on the island seems to be horribly contrived, as if someone said, 'Great, love the whole island thing, now throw in some more stuff  so we can get over 2 hours out of it.' I mean it all seems almost tacked on, and it's all too pat. I will say this much, though: the ending is NOT cliched.Hanks is better than I expected. He's not really the adventurer type, is he? In some scenes, with his scraggly beard and makeshift clothing, he looks like Lawrence of Arabia or maybe Moses from The Ten Commandments. He effectively shows emotion, determination, perseverence, wit, and ingenuity. I'd also say he ages well, too, but then you have to remember Robert Zemeckis filmed this movie in two installments so he could do What Lies Beneath; this layoff allowed Hanks to transform from girly man Fed Ex dude to strapping strongman (sort of). Everyone else is just extraneous. This is Tom's game.",6,0,1,28 December 2000
The Village," The Village Idiot
","I am now officially off the M. Night Shyamalan bandwagon. Nope, that's it, I'm through giving him the benefit of the doubt. See, I really loved The Sixth Sense. Thought it was fantastic. Creepy, too. I liked Unbreakable, too. Sure, it was flawed, and I could see how some people might not like it, but I appreciated with Shyamalan was doing, and I liked the two lead performances. But then Signs came. And I thought Signs was hideously dreadful, lacking a sense of humor when it was needed and being way too flippant when the situation called for levity. I felt Signs was merely a product of an overactive ego and an inactive imagination. But I figured that since even the best filmmakers have their vanity movies, I'd forgive Shyamalan his Signs and looked forward to his next movie. Well, The Village isn't much better than Signs, and that's a real shame.The setting is 1897 in a remote village in the Pennsylvania woods. It's a very quiet, unpreposessing village, complete with village elders, politeness among folk, and a one-room school house. (These folks look and act Amish, although that's not specified.)But this idyllic, placid hamlet has a secret. See, it's bordered on all sides by the forest, and within the forest are these unspeakable creatures, Those Who Shall Not Be Named. Oddly enough, you would think such an appellation would prevent people from openly discussing said creatures, but I lost count how many times they were mentioned. Anyway, the creatures, we're told, have a deal with the villagers - no villager will cross the perimeter into the forest, and no creature will enter the village. The villagers have yellow flags around their perimeter and a giant tower with a bell at the top, so if and when a creature comes a-calling, the bell can be rung and people can get to safety. The village elders, led by Edward Walker (William Hurt, sincere as always), forbid anyone from crossing the perimeter; the villagers are also informed that the creatures hate the color red ('the bad color,' as it's called in hushed whispers!).Weird things have been afoot, though. Small animals have been killed in the village, skinned and left to be discovered by open-mouthed villagers. And when a creature is indeed spotted entering the perimeter, the next morning there are slashes of red paint on the doors of people's homes. What could this mean? Who hath breached the perimeter?One man, Lucius Hunt (played with open-mouth ennui by Joaquin Phoenix), asks the elders for permission to go to a neighboring village to get medicine. You see, the village is hampered by a distinct lack of medical supplies, and when its citizens are quite ill, they have no choice but to watch them die. They'd prefer this, apparently, to getting medical supplies.Now, any time the phrase 'only one man' pops up in a synopsis of a movie, you know you need to relax your curiosity and just let things happen. 'Oh, here we go,' you think. 'Good IL' Commodus is going to be the One Man who can save the villagers from the creatures - and themselves!'There are a few twists to the movie, so I'll halt the synopsis here. The trouble is the twists are likely to affect you in one of two ways: Either you'll say, 'I saw THAT coming,' or you'll merely shrug your shoulders and wonder if the exit door to the theater will open to a part of the parking lot that's a real hike to your car. Personally, I was affected in both ways.The movie's simply not well written. There's suspense, but often it's clouded by contrivances in the plot. Shyamalan wants us to fear the creatures as much as the villagers do, but he doesn't succeed. We're supposed to feel empathy for the villagers, but all I could feel was pity and scorn.The pacing is pretty tight, which is nice, since it's essential that a suspense movie be well paced. But the camera angles often looked amateurish and/or auteurish; either Shyamalan didn't know how to shoot a particular scene or he decided to be cute and make it seem as if the scene had some sort of Deep Meaning. Now, it's true there's a moral to the story here (something about You Stay on Your Side, I'll Stay on Mine), but the tone achieved by the direction didn't really convey that. A huge debit, too, is the soundtrack - does Shyamalan not know how to use one effectively? In most scenes, the soundtrack was blaring at such a high volume that the actors could barely be heard. What's the point of that, exactly?Finally, the acting. No one is spectacularly miscast (although I wonder if Adrien Brody, who won an Oscar for goodness sake, is kicking himself for agreeing to play the village idiot), but no one really shines, either. How could they, with a plot so thin you could read fine print through it? Most of the actors are... well, useless. They don't do much with what little they have to work with and are essentially wasted, especially Sigourney Weaver. Hurt is quietly effective, but it's a role he can play in his sleep by this point. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard is moderately annoying, which ain't good when you have a very prominent role.The Village is trite and cloying, a mishmash of 'twists' that alternately make no sense and make too much sense and can be foretold well in advance. M. Night Shyamalan has taken a pretty solid, intriguing premise and riddled it with illogic and disdain.",2,2,4,31 July 2004
Pitch Black," Imperfect Pitch
","A spaceship crash-lands on a desolate planet. Now the survivors must face the unknown - and each other - in a never-ending game of terror.Sound familiar? Okay, maybe a little. But there are a couple of hooks in this movie. One is that the planet these guys have landed on has three suns, and wouldn't ya know it all three suns are about ready to align, plunging the planet into a complete and lasting darkness. Add to this creepy setting a malicious convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who's gone to the trouble of having his eyeballs surgically altered so he can see in the dark, the better to sneak up on you, my dear. This is explained to us rather poignantly early on, and of course his eyesight becomes useful later on.
There are two ways to look at this movie - either as generic drama, powered by a plot, or as a horror film. Those of you looking at it as a horror film already have low standards (admit it!), so you won't be disappointed. I don't mean to belittle you, but let's face it - when you want to sit down to a good horror film, the story isn't always a top priority. You want stuff that'll scare you! If you're looking at this as a drama - man versus self, man versus alien planet, and so forth - you still won't be disappointed. In short, there are two things going for this - an excellent use of special effects (and, consequently, a great sense of what's creepy) and a solid plot. You can't go wrong. To complicate matters, the remaining humans - now deep in darkness, with only flares, flashlights, etc. to help them - are besieged by nasty flying alien creatures who only attack in the dark. Seeing the ripe and ready flesh of the humans must seem like an all-you-can-eat buffet to the aliens. And if the outside threat isn't enough, our heroes have to deal with Riddick, who's released from his chains early on. Will he kill them all? Will aliens slaughter them in their sleep?I won't get into the acting except to say that I have movie posters in my house that have more emotion and personality. And the script itself - the dialog sounds as if it were written by a high-schooler. But there are a lot of genuinely startling moments, and there's a magnificent atmosphere to the whole deal. You never get to settle in to the movie, and that's key to a horror film, in my book. At no point did I have a chance to sit back and notice how bad the acting was, and that's quite a feat. So, in short, you can either look at this movie super-critically (in which case you won't be pleased, unless you delight in finding fault!) or simply go with the flow. It's a scary ride, folks, because you don't know what you'll run into when it's dark.",6,0,0,7 November 2000
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Spellbinding - worth it in IMAX, too
","Harry Potter's penultimate film journey is an immediate smash, judiciously mixing mythology, romance, teenage lifestyles, lowbrow comedy, adult themes, and nonstop action into a blizzard of entertainment that really could be conjured up only by a wizard who kicked butt in his or her O.W.L. exam. This first-half-of-the-last-book movie is exceptional and suffers only from a weird shift in tone near the middle of the film.If you have never read a Harry Potter book, this is not the movie for you to watch. Please don't watch it. You'll spend most of the movie muttering to whomever is closest, asking who these characters are and what are they doing and why are they flushing themselves down toilets (the better to get into the Ministry, my dear), and so on. Face it; you're quite the Muggle and will have no chance of comprehending this movie.For the rest of you... Well, even if you haven't read the seventh (and final) book, you should be able to follow along. I'll try hard not to spoil anything for you, but some things from the earlier books may creep in, so beware.The movie begins a few days before Harry's 17th birthday, and the Dudley family is leaving their home out of concern for their own safety. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is to be escorted to The Burrow and live with the Weasely family until the school year begins, but he and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have another plan: to find the remaining Horcruxes, objects into which the evil Lord Voldemort has spliced parts of his soul (self preservation, you see).For the first time in the series, the school of Hogwarts doesn't make an appearance. Harry and his pals, under the indirect order of Albus Dumbeldore, need to find these objects before Voldemort gains any more strength; the Dark Lord, of course, is making great headway into running things anyway, what with his Death Eaters and his infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.As with the rest of the books and movies, there are dual plots. There's the obvious line of the search for the remaining Horcruxes, and there's the subtle look at the way the trio is growing up, wary of their feelings for one another. One of the more remarkable aspects of J. K. Rowling's books is that she tries to accurately depict the lives of average teenagers - even if the teenagers themselves aren't average at all. So here, we see Ron and Hermione grudgingly accepting how much each means to the other, which leads to confusing and conflicting feelings on their parts as well. All normal for teenagers, and all well done.A word of caution, if you haven't read the book: good people die. Don't ask me who; I can't tell you. But it's the last book in the series, and there are a lot of secondary and tertiary characters - surely not all of them would be expected to make it, right? Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing their roles for almost a full decade now, and their chemistry is palpable on screen. As usual, they are surrounded by a solid British cast, including Brendan Gleeson (Mad-Eye Moody), David Thewlis (Remus Lupin), Bill Nighy (Rufus Scrimgeour), Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy), Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). Each plays his or her part with all expected prowess, but rising above all of them is Mrs. Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the nefarious Bellatrix Lestrange with a maniacal glee that borders on pure insanity. Her eye alone has depth.Here's the only part of the entire movie that just didn't work for me. There is a long stretch in which our heroes search valiantly for the Horcruxes, and during that time there's a bit of a disagreement, causing one of them to leave the other two. Afterwards, the way the remaining two behave - in one scene - almost justifies the anger of their departed friend, thus shifting the tone a little bit. This isn't in the book at all, and I found it a bit worrisome. Why muddy the waters? It's complicated enough for the characters without more drama for the sake of drama.The Deathly Hallows, by the way, are magical artifacts, and one of the big questions in the book is whether the three should search for these mythical Hallows or continue to look for the Horcruxes. Doesn't matter much, as they are all intertwined.Eduardo Serra's cinematography is breathtaking, particularly the first battle scene after Harry leaves the Dudley's house and the battles in the forest and at stately Malfoy Manor. Serra replaced Bruno Delbonnel, who reportedly was afraid he'd begin to repeat himself. But no matter, because the film by no means has a different look or feel than the previous entries (except that the subject matter is even darker, of course).If you have read the seventh book, you might wonder how this movie ends; where's a good stopping point? Again, I won't reveal that here, but when you see the movie you'll probably agree that it ends appropriately. I mean, this isn't like Back to the Future II, which was cynically used just to set up III; this is a standalone movie that's really supposed to be in conjunction with a companion movie anyway.As a fan of the Harry Potter books and subsequent movies, I feel that the seventh movie is as outstanding as I expected it would be. Aside from the one strange tonal shift - which is quickly shifted back - there's really very little wrong with this movie, and most people should find it very enjoyable.",9,1,2,20 November 2010
Cold Mountain," Turgid melodrama
","Neither engrossing or compelling, Cold Mountain is a tale of a Confederate soldier (Jude Law) and his attempts to return home to his sweetheart (Nicole Kidman) in North Carolina.Since Inman (Law) has been gone for so long, Ada Monroe has taken over the management of her farm. But since the Civil War is underway, there aren't any handymen to be found who could help her with the day-to-day operations, so Ruby Thewes (Rene Zellweger), a rough-and-tumble tomboy who happens to have long, flowing blonde hair and wear a copious amount of lipstick, shows up to lend a hand and a barbed tongue.There are two story strands: Inman's travails as he desperately tries to get home (and labeled a deserter, at that) and Ada's difficulties as she alternately clears fields and pines for Inman. And pine she does! She can't live without him, it seems, and yet.. and yet somehow, she does. She puts off advances from other, opportunistic menfolk who are a-dyin' to get in her britches, all the while learning all kinds of Man Stuff, like firing a gun. O, will she survive? Will Inman make it home before his not-a-wife gives up and marries the cad from down the lane? I'm all a-twitter with my ruminations. Kidman and Law are well cast and do have some chemistry together (and Kidman's appropriately pale in complexion, since she's playing someone who's been sheltered most of her life, at least figuratively speaking). Zellweger, however, seems hilariously miscast. I know part of it is because her character's so broadly written, but her performance alternately made me chuckle and cringe, chuckle and cringe.It doesn't help that the movie's slowly paced and has at least two too many endings. Anthony Minghella directed, though, so that was to be expected.",4,0,2,24 August 2004
Kung Fu Panda 2," A fanda the Panda
","You know how tough it can be to follow up a truly well-done movie, especially an animated one. I think Kung Fu Panda 2 surpasses the original, and it's because it introduces some heretofore unseen layers of Po while combining some contrasting animation styles. It's expertly directed by Jennifer Yuh and features the returning voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and others.In this installment, the Dragon Warrior panda Po (Black) is now teamed with the Furious Five, defending the town from evil doers. Exposition tells us of the banished son of the old king and queen, peacocks, who became prideful and menacing, and now he's back to avenge his parents' treatment of him and to take over China - and, by extension, the world. This son, Shen (Gary Oldman) plans to do this by using fireworks as weapons to usher out the era of kung fu. Meanwhile, Po comes to realize that he is not the natural son of his father, the goose (James Hong). Don't ask why this is news.During flashbacks, we get to see what tiny snippets of Po's childhood emerge in his subconscious. He was placed by his mother in a pot of radishes and found by Mr. Ping (Hong). But why was he left there? What happened to his parents? Does Shen hold some of the answers? Probably. For - not a spoiler - it has been foretold that Shen will be defeated by a black-and-white warrior, by the local soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh). Shen knows this, Po does not. So much to like about this movie. In those flashbacks, Yuh uses an entirely different style of animation, mostly black and white, to underline the intensity of the scenes. It's reminiscent of the O-Ren Ishii's flashback scenes in Kill Bill, come to think of it. Dazzling and detailed, these scenes are emotional and provocative. A little more than you'd expect from a kids' film, but trust me when I say that the scenes are well done and by no means dwell on violence. They're tense, but not truly intense.Po himself takes on a role exuding more confidence and leadership. He's not just a bumbling panda this time around. He is a little quicker, a little smarter, although just as unwieldy and ungainly. He lends the team both clear vision and witty repartee. Although he's just as big as ever, he's become more agile and more thoughtful, more inclined to listen to Master Shifu (Hoffman) and Tigress (Jolie) than before. This makes the action scenes - and there are some terrific ones - honestly compelling.It's nice to see everyone resuming their old roles, even if actors like David Cross, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu get short shrift (someone has to). It's Po's story. Importantly, I never felt as if this was an example of stunt casting, as each actor seems to be fitting for his or her role. Be warned, though - the movie, like most animated films, does have its hankie moments. Here, they come at the very end, and they are as beautiful and touching as the rest of the film is charming and invigorating. The denouement offers a fitting coda for this masterful film.",9,0,1,13 June 2012
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Can't Do Wrong
","You know, a decade or so ago, I had a 1977 Volkswagen minibus. Had a couple hundred thousand miles on it and was a tough drive if one wasn't used to manual transmissions, but it looked cool in a somewhat-ironic way and was, of course, a viable means of conveyance. You'll find almost the same exact VW in Little Miss Sunshine, with the same wacky orange exterior and weird off-beige interior, but what sets this one apart from mine is that the Hoover family car has such fun problems as a disappearing clutch, a side door that doesn't close correctly, and a horn that doesn't quite stop honking. And yet somehow the vehicle manages to hold itself together long enough to travel from Arizona to California and back for the much-heralded Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for young girls.One of the two magnificent aspects of the movie is that the family's comprised of unlikeable people, that is, normal people to whom you yourself might be related. There's no hero, exactly (save Olive, the kidlet), because each of the members has some kind of negative vibe going on, whether it's bankruptcy, smoking, muteness, drug use, or suicide. Oh, sure, they're a regular Manson Family there, except for the killing bit. Anyway, the family has to shepherd young Olive to the pageant one weekend because she learns at the last minute that she's become a contestant (she finished fourth in an earlier pageant, but third place got sick) and her usual ride for these pageants is unavailable. So the entire family piles into the microbus (without shovels and rakes and implements of destruction - see if you get that reference), owing to a whole bunch of reasons. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is going, because he's responsible for teaching Olive the number she'll do for the talent portion of the show. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear) is going because he alone can drive the VW; mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) is going because, well, she wants to. And suicidal uncle Frank (Steve Carell) can't be left alone, but brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is perhaps a little young to stay home aloneish.If this were a typical family movie, you'd expect the dysfunctional clan to grow over the course of their journey, to learn to love each other despite all flaws, to bond and harmonize soulfully behind the dreamy Olive. No way that happens here; these people clearly don't like each other, except Olive, who's immune (and/or oblivious) to the negative vibes surrounding her family.A great deal of the entertainment value of Little Miss Sunshine are the wacky adventures that the group gets into during the ride to Redondo Beach, and it's not just red herrings that filmmakers toss in to distract you from a crappy plot - you can well imagine these things happening to anyone, such as the aforementioned clutch problem. So the movie automatically feels real to you, not like you're just watching a bunch of actors going through the motions. And then things REALLY pick up once they get to the pageant.Like I said, everyone's sort of dislikable. Grandpa is a drug-using, cranky ol' coot who's prone to blunt, profanity-laced tirades. Which makes him several kinds of awesome right there. His son Richard is a controlling goof who completely subscribes to the nine-steps-to-success program that he hawks for a living ('Don't be a loser!'). Cheryl, who somehow holds the family together, chain smokes and seems the very portrait of crass white trash, while her brother Frank is a gay near-suicide who's been released into his sister's care. Oh, and then there's Dwayne, who's intentionally mute. Nope, not saying a word, no way, not until he enters the Air Force Academy; it's some sort of discipline exercise.And at the center of all this weirdness is little, slightly pudgy Olive, played by the wonderful Abagail Breslin, perhaps best known for playing one of Mel Gibson's strange kids in Signs. Olive is adorable and real, in contrast to other contestants, who are perhaps adorable but quite artificial. Anyway, Olive seems ignorant of the wacky behavior of her relations except in the most abstract terms, as one might expect from an eight-year-old (meaning she's not stricken by that Hollywood disease of precociousness). Breslin's a real treat, and she was rewarded for her excellent performance with an Oscar nomination.I mentioned two entertaining aspects of the movie; the other is that the denouement isn't a perfect happy ending. Add that to the realistic - often hysterical, mind you - situations in which the family finds itself, while seemingly not behaving out of character, and you have a gloriously funny film.",9,1,2,25 January 2007
Hugo," Dazzling not-kiddie fare from Scorsese makes great use of 3D for once
","This imaginative movie about movies is charming, sentimental, and quaint. It is not really for kids (they'll get bored by the plot), although it sustains a level of wonder and joy you don't expect from a Martin Scorsese film. Hugo will rekindle a love for the movies for some and open up an entirely new universe to others. Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who lives in a train station, making sure the giant clocks all run on time. He's been deserted by his soused uncle (Ray Winstone), and his parents are long gone. Hugo is alone with his clock machinery and some various doodads from his father, including an old automaton that had been programmed to write and draw. The automaton requires a special key to be activated, and once Hugo locates said key, the real mystery, involving the proverbial wheels within wheels, just like clockwork, is afoot.As an orphan, Hugo must steal food in order to live. He also takes tools so he can work on the automaton, and he's caught by a toymaker named Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley). Méliès has a granddaughter, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, who takes pity on the poor Hugo and helps him in his quest to solve the riddle of the automaton. When Isabelle and Hugo finally do get the automaton working, they find their plans shifting from a connection between the automaton and Hugo's late father and to the previous owner of the automaton, who identity shall remain a mystery here.I'm not a paid reviewer, so I figure it's okay if I take the cheap route and offer up a bad pun. The movie is timely. More than 100 years have passed since the invention of motion pictures, and there are so many people who have no idea what those early films were like. Scorsese, a longtime movie historian, knows all too well his audience, and he gradually allows them to assimilate within the friendly confines of a boy-with-a-mysterious-past story before inviting them into the early world of movies.This is a 3D movie, by the way, and it's the rarest of birds – the kind in which the 3D doesn't attack you like you owe it even more money but rather the kind you don't notice until you need to notice it. Scorsese, ever the perfectionist, uses the medium to its utmost, with a terrific sense of when to hold back and when to hold forth. Not bad at all for his first foray into the new hip way of shooting movies. So, for me, the 3D version of this film is definitely worthwhile.By the final 20 minutes or so of the movie, I was absolutely entranced by what had by then become an homage to older films, to the very dawn of cinema. Scorsese takes great pains to show how difficult it was for fledgling filmmakers to make a movie look so easy. No special effects, no budget, handmade costumes – it was like working with a small grammar school. At one point we are shown an early reel, from the nineteen- aughts, and it's in color. A character explains that although the movie was shot in black and white, the crew painstakingly hand-colored various scenes to add a touch of tint. It's a beautiful detail that I assume is true, as Scorsese, in the framework of a lost-child plot, seeks to educate those of us who are not film historians.And by the end of the movie, the wonderful, poignant performances by Kingsley, Butterfield, Moretz, and Helen McCrory dissolved my senses. There are several touching moments in the waning minutes of the film, and the cast hits all of the right notes. Hugo would serve as a poetic coda if this were the end of the great director's career, but even so it's a love note to the world of movies, translated for a wide, new audience.",9,3,6,6 February 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Somewhere in the middle of YES! and yeah.
","Smack dab in the middle of such lustrous movies as Pirates of the Carribbean, The Hulk, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Matrix: Reloaded, and X2 comes Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You know, I remember when Arnold was mighty enough to warrant a Fourth of July opening for his movies, but apparently his studio is happy with the movie's being buried in a sea of zap!bam!pow! action movies.Ah, but enough carping about the timing. Let's get to the nitty gritty, shall we?People fall into three categories. First, there are the ones who have never seen a Terminator film. Those people aren't likely to watch this third installment. Then there are the ones who thought the second one was better than the first. Those people will probably think this one's not as good as the second, but about on par with the first. And then thee are those who thought the first one rocked like a mighty cradle; those people might be disappointed and will probably crow to the rest of us that sequels are always bad and that the original is always better.Here's the story, kids. The scene is a few years after Terminator 2. In that movie, John Connor was 11 years old. Now he's more like 14 or 15. He's on his own, pretty much bumming around the country, doing odd jobs, always on the run, that sort of thing. And somehow he runs into the Terminator along the way.Now, you might remember the Terminator as being Bad in the first movie and Good in the second. When John meets him, he doesn't know which attitude will be taken by the robot. So why is the T-800 (Arnold) back? Well, he said he'd be. But more importantly, he's here to protect John once again. And from whom, you might ask? From a T-X, a female Terminator, sent back in time by the machines in the future to kill John's lieutenants.See, the machines don't know where John is in this present time. They do have a fix on the whereabouts of the people who will become his top deputies when he finally leads the resistance. Their theory, then, is to kill them off, hoping to thwart the rebellion by man before it really develops.Funny thing, though. The homeless John breaks into a veterinary clinic to get some medicine, and it just so happens that working at the clinic is Kate Brewster, who is to be one of his lieutentants. The T-X arrives there to rub Kate out and stumbles upon John, and that's when Arnold shows up.The second Terminator movie had a huge budget, and the money was wisely spent on special effects, effects that were state-of-the-art in 1991. Now, CGI is all the rage, so the effects aren't so special. So to make up for a lack of innovation, the filmmakers (not James Cameron, who made the first two movies) throw in a lot of crashes, explosions and other loudnesses. In fact, there's a long, long car/truck chase scene near the very beginning that's pretty well done - but overlong. And, unfortunately, it occurs before the plot can really be set in place.The movie itself isn't very long - two hours is nothing for an action movie. A little more plot padding would have made me feel better about it.But back to the movie as a whole. Nick Stahl plays John now (it was Edward Furlong in the second, in his debut), and he does a great job. He looks a lot like Ed Furlong probably looks now. Kate Brewster is played by Claire Danes. Yes, Claire Danes! A bit of an unusual role for her, but she can do plucky and empathetic. And of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T-800, the original Terminator. There's one cameo by a character who had a big role in the second Terminator movie, and it's a funny one, too.Will you enjoy this movie? I think you will, but it's not going to blow you away like the first or second may have. Arnold carries this movie for the most part, because he doesn't have Linda Hamilton from the other films (as John's mother, Sarah) to help him out. Hamilton was a big reason that T2 was so successful - her role made it more than a Guys Smash Stuff movie. This one doesn't quite escape that fate, however.",7,0,0,21 July 2003
U-571," Rub-a-dub-sub
","U-571During World War II, Adolf Hitler's Germans had 1,100 U-Boats in commission in the North Atlantic Ocean. On one of those boats existed a small, typewriter-shaped apparatus called simply Enigma - a code machine with which the Nazis transmitted messages from submarine to submarine.The boat holding the Enigma is unexpectedly disabled in the middle of the sea. While the crew waits for help from its countrymen, the U.S. covertly approaches it with a mission: board the vessel and obtain the Enigma at all costs. Drafted for this dangerous mission are a group of sailors - not soldiers - led by the redoubtable Lieutenant Andrew Tyler  (Matthew McConaughey, his ample locks shorn). But getting on the boat is only half the task, of course. Soon the Americans are stranded on a foreign sub, with all of the instructions and designations written in German! Luckily for them (!) they were wise enough to include in their number a young sailor who speaks fluent German. What're the odds, really? And while they're trying to translate the German post-haste for a dive, they're suddenly in the sights of a German destroyer! Kind of one of those days when you just wish you had not gotten out of bed.This another popcorn action movie, a white-knuckler that will leave you gripping your chair - our boys are in such peril throughout the movie, and they use up just about every life and chance they have coming to them - that while you know that in the grand Hollywood tradition of the Good Guys winning (and with the knowledge that the Germans did lose the war), you still root and cheer for the sailors to pull through. Plus some really DAZZLING effects, which are even nicer on DVD. Torpedos slam into metal! Subs DIVE DIVE DIVE! The pace is electrifying, if not altogether believable. Pack a lot of MREs for this one!",7,1,3,13 November 2000
"I, Robot"," Awful.
","Forget the title. Those of you who recognize its relevance would be severely disappointed to see few elements of Isaac Asimov's stories in this movie, and those of you who don't recognize the relevance will find a plethora of other problems to kvetch about.The year is 2035, and robots are everywhere. They're intelligent, sentient beings, kind of, and can perform quite an array of tasks. They've become so commonplace that their morality are never in question, thanks to the Three Rules of Robots, which prevent a robot from causing harm to humans.Not everyone's drinking the robot kool-aid, though. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who hates robots with a passion, is assigned to a case in which a preeminent robotics scientist (James Cromwell) appeared to have jumped through a window many, many stories up, splattering himself all over the lobby of his office building. Grimacing and muttering all the while, Spooner sets out to investigate what seems like a suicide. But our intrepid hero - as well as 99.9999% of the viewing audience - thinks something else is afoot.(Which reminds me. In movies such as this, look at what the lead character does and says when we first meet him. Rarely are lines said for the sake of natural feel; they all Mean Something to the plot, however small.) The beauty of megabad movies is that they offer so much fodder for humor. For example, nearly every character is a caricature, from the tough-love police lieutenant (Chi McBride, typecast) to the cute-intellectual female scientist to Spooner's wise and doting grandmother. The makers of this crap could have just used cardboard cutouts with the stereotype written on them in permanent marker.As Spooner unearths more evidence and more people become convinced he's losing his mind, the audience is relegated to counting the clichés and the cereal-box writing. I swear, if I hear Smith say, 'Oh HELL no!' in one more movie, I'm gonna upchuck my Milk Duds. His wisecracks are neither wise nor cracky. At one point, his lieutenant kicks him off the force, asking him for his badge. And just his badge - he's allowed to keep his gun. Good thing, because he needed it for the rest of the movie, as it turned out.The plot is nonsensical if one looks at it too closely. Guy dies. Cop blames a robot. Everyone else blames guy and laughs at the cop, who has a history of violence against robots. Who's right? Who cares, anyway? It's all a soulless, turgid mountain gibberish. There's not an honest or original thought in the movie. You'll be several jumps ahead of the criminally stupid Spooner. In real life, Spooner would have been gutted by his fellow humans; he wouldn't be able to make a dopey analytical statement and then follow it with a high-larious side-splitting witticism without being drawn and quartered. Or so one would hope.The only saving grace is the effects. 2035 (not too far from now, kiddies!) looks like a pretty cool place to be, much more so than most futures look on the silver screen. There's no post apocalyptic nightmare. No marauding bands of hellions looking for water, or dry land, or both. Everything looks gee-whiz-bang; in the middle of them is Spooner as anachronism, complete with Converse sneakers, a stereo that works by remote and not verbal commands, and manual driving. You know, rather than letting those bad IL' robots drive.But see, this is old news. Go watch Demolition Man (1993). Instead of Bridget Moynahan in this one, you'd get Sandra Bullock. And instead of Will Smith, you'd get real action stars, like Sly Stallone and Wesley Snipes. And it's more fun, because it never takes itself too seriously. This movie does, even though it's far more style than substance. The underlying problem here is that director Alex Proyas and writers Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman chose to use 2004 sensibilities and behavior in a movie set in 2035.I, Robot is a bottomless pit of dung. There, I said it. This movie is like graffitti in the otherwise-respectable wall of Will Smith's career. But what I, Robot teaches us, boys and girls, is that Will Smith is not so much an actor as a Movie Star. He's resplendent in all of his Smithisms; all that's missing is a white guy to whom Smith can impart sage advice.",2,4,8,26 January 2005
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Can animals talk in this universe? I don't wanna freak him out.
","Wow! I would have thought that an animated superhero movie would be more like, I don't know, a feature-length cartoon. Something innocuous for the kids to enjoy. But this sucker is way more than that, an absolute masterpiece both technically and creatively. Strong, exciting performances by Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali, John Mulaney, and oh yes, Nicolas Cage abound. Intense, genuine, and a real treat for everyone. Visually arresting and downright dazzling. And let's not forget the badass Aunt May, Lily Tomlin! Lily Tomlin! And finally, we all learn how one should swing from a thread. It's no wonder this was so critically lauded at award time.",9,0,1,18 March 2019
American Beauty," A tryst to build a dream on...
","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is an ordinary guy. He's forty-something, has a successful job, a pretty wife, and a loving daughter. Or does he? As he examines his life, he notices there's less and less joy in it as the years go by. He also mopes about it a lot, wondering just when it was that the living disappeared from his life. The sex has vanished from his marriage to strong-willed real-estate agent Carolyn (Annette Bening), and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) detests him. And poor Lester's just stumbling through his dreamlike life, trapped in suburbia, when an encounter with his daughter's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari) wakes him out of his catatonia.Lester can't keep his mind off Angela, a sexpot who wants to be a model someday. Angela's bossy, manipulative, tough, and very egocentric. She apparently keeps Jane around to make herself feel better and never tires of bragging of her own sexual exploits. Add to that personality an underage, nubile body, and Lester's hooked. When he overhears Angela say to Jane that Lester might be goodlooking if he worked out, Lester begins to pump iron in the garage. Next thing you know, he's smoking pot with the rebel next door (Wes Bentley), who has his OWN litany of psychosocial problems. And then it gets interesting!Alan Ball's script never lets up, and there are hardly any laggards among the actors, either. Spacey won an Academy Award for his skillful work as the demented, although not without logic, Lester. Lester's creepy - if you had him as a next-door neighbor and knew him well enough, you'd move yourself and your family to another state. Spacey paints Lester, however, not as a single-minded psychopath, but as a reasonable, self-sufficient, logical man who simply wants to revitalize his own existence. Having seen the movie, I simply can't picture another actor turning in this kind of performance. Spacey's characterization is a lot like a car wreck on the turnpike - you can't help but stop and look at it, although you feel guilty about liking what you see.Annette Bening's no slouch either. The role of Carolyn is a difficult one, as she must appear both together and apart mentally. Her character is amazingly multilayered - she's not just a shallow, career-minded woman, she's a shallow, career-minded woman with emotional problems that could choke Freud. And Thora Birch (remember her as the little kid in Patriot Games?) is magnificent as Jane, the sullen daughter. It's not easy to capture the essence of being a teenager on film, and Birch comes closest than most. Needless to say, the whole cast is top-notch, as is the direction. Bottom line - this is a creepy, unsettling, one-of-a-kind movie.",9,0,0,11 May 2000
Over the Hedge," Solid, amusing, fun-festooned treat!
","Based on the popular comic strip by Michael Fry, Over the Hedge is sweet, innocent fun with just enough wry humor and chicanery to keep adults amused. I wasn't a fan of the bland musical interludes, but the voice characterizations were dead on, and the storyline was charming.The story begins with a battle: a raccoon, named RJ (Bruce Willis), versus a tenacious vending machine. We can all relate to RJ's anguish when the snack just won't come out of the machine, no matter what method he tries. Soon he's bounding up a hill to ransack the cave of a hibernating bear (voiced by Nick Nolte). Who, of course wakes up (early) as RJ is making his escape. Long story short, the bear's wagon of food winds up being decimated by a tractor-trailer in the highway. As a result, Vincent the Bear tells RJ that when he (Vincent) wakes up from hibernation in two weeks' time, RJ had better have returned ALL of the food, plus the wagon and a cooler - or else.Next, a heterogeneous group of woodland creatures wakes up in a hollowed log. Led by the organized Verne the Turtle (Gary Shandling), the various critters must now assemble enough food to last them through the next winter as well. Ah, but then they discover The Hedge. It seems that during their long slumber, their beloved forest has been encroached by Suburbia. Gasp! Luckily, new friend RJ is there to explain it all to them and to tell them of his plan to replenish their food supply - raid the houses over the hedge, of course! There are a couple of themes here to teach the kidlets: trust and friendship. As a loner raccoon, RJ has no friends and no one to trust, so he tries to bamboozle the other animals into scrounging up enough food for him to pay off Vincent the Bear. Meanwhile, Verne (who's the smartest of his bunch and the most suspicious) doesn't really trust RJ and thinks his plan will wind up getting some or more of them killed.But this is a cartoon, after all, so wacky hijinks surely win out over maudlin Lessons Learned, although, as with the best cartoon, your younger set will surely take away good, positive themes. Well, that and some great physical comedy, including a scene in which RJ and Verne wind up in an airborne child's wagon.The movie's voices are well cast; in addition to Willis, Nolte, and Shandling, we hear from Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, and Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, who are wonderful as porcupine spouses.Even the brief, listless musical numbers won't turn off many people, as the movie manages to bring forth the funny while remaining true to the spirit of its predecessor comic strip.",7,0,0,18 November 2006
Wanted," It's got Jolie and guns - what else ya need
","In 2008's Wanted, James McAvoy plays an anxious computer jockey, taken advantage of by all who know him, who discovers not only that his long-lost dad has been murdered and that said dad was actually an elite assassin but also that he himself has super-spy skills and must be trained to harness them. And one of his fellow assassins is Angelina Jolie. So it's basically a fantasy aimed at shlubby white males.McAvoy's Wesley is an office drone who takes medication for his anxiety and is bullied by his abusive stapler-clicking boss and whose buddy (played by Chris Pratt) has been boinking Wesley's harpy girlfriend. He lives in an apartment alongside an elevated railroad. His life sucks. So you can imaging his surprise when he's confronted by a mysterious woman named Fox (Jolie) while getting his prescription filled. A man has tracked him to the drugstore, she purrs, and he's about to kill you. A shootout ensues. Fox and Wesley escape, and he's brought to a textile factory to meet the suave Mr. Sloan, who gives Wesley the lowdown on his origins (every hero needs one) and gives him a motive – to find and assassinate the man who murdered his father.But before that can happen, we must endure a training montage. Wesley learns how to fight with knives – and gets plenty of slices of his own. Wesley learns how to take a punch while being tied to a chair. Wesley learns how to fire a gun so that the bullet curves around obstacles. You know, standard-issue stuff. And then he's ready! Wait, no he's not. Sloan makes him do some killin' missions. You know, to keep up appearances with the other assassins. The basic idea is that the looms in the textile factory contain coded messages that, when decoded, provide the name of the assassin group's next target.The story is based on a comic book, or graphic novel, whichever is appropriate, so suspension of disbelief is paramount. Take the idea behind curving bullets. Or that Wesley can suddenly get ripped and become great at hand-to-hand fighting. Or that there's a magical soaking tub that heals everything from scratches to broken bones. Gotta just buy into it. Fail to do so at your own peril, is what I'm getting at here.Anyway, I liked the movie. A lot of exhilarating action, and then there's Jolie. Hardly says a word for the first hour of the movie. Easy work if you can get it. Come to think of it, she doesn't say much in the movie, and I'm betting a stunt double helped in some of the action scenes. Now that's a good career choice.Wanted was as outlandishly high energy as one might expect, so I'd recommend it for action movie fans, or comic-book fans, and especially Jolie fans.",7,1,2,9 September 2014
Salt," Stunning Jolie slums it well in tight thriller
","Salt, a spy movie about a CIA agent who may or may not actually be a Soviet agent, is a heck of a lot better than others in its genre. It has a lot of pulse-quickening action, astounding stunt work, and a semiplausible plot. Oh, and someone named Angelina Jolie to do all the requisite butt-kicking.There have been plenty of psychological thrillers in which the protagonist is double crossed, then triple crossed, and so on until the audience quite literally has no idea who's on what side or who's doing what to whom - it's sort of an entertainment by obfuscation. Sleight of hand. It's when the director tries hard to confuse the bejeezus out of everyone, the better to disguise a thin plot and cardboard acting.But that isn't true here. Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA analyst who's accused - from the get-go - of being a sleeper spy, by a Russian attempting to defect. Naturally, our gal Evelyn bolts the CIA and goes on the run. But unlike other movies, where the balance of the plot would be devoted to her finding the Real Bad Guys and Righting Wrongs and Clearing Her Name, this film keeps us guessing: Is Salt really a preprogrammed spy with the goal of assassinating the visiting Russian president? Her CIA boss (Liev Shrieber) and the head of counterintelligence (Chiwetel Ejiofor) dash off to New York to catch her, and she eludes them at every step. And all the while, we're not sure if she's a good guy or a bad guy, or a good guy with bad intentions, or perhaps a good guy with a shady past.And although the ending isn't neat and tidy, it's also not implausible, another hallmark of run-of-the-mill spy thrillers. It's refreshing.Angelina Jolie has shown time and time again that she supersedes all of those preconceived ideas of pretty actresses. She's beautiful, yes, but she's also a very gifted actress. It's in full evidence here, as her Salt dons numerous disguises that really do a good job of hiding her amazing looks. Lesser actresses would wilt under the pressure of, you know, actually performing as opposed to being gawked at, but Jolie flourishes. And she has some serious action-movie chops, too! Apparently, she did her own stunts, and she's simply electrifying. It's easy to believe that her role was originally written for a male lead - what in Hollywood isn't? - but it's hard to imagine many top-shelf actors doing as much with the role as Jolie does here. As with the best actors, Jolie can do a lot with the slightest bit of movement or expression. She is mesmerizing and tremendous.She's ably supported by Shrieber and Ejiofor, and although neither character is particularly fleshed out, neither, too, is obvious and shallow. So, good script from Kurt Wimmer.Oh, sure, there's a spot midway through the movie where you begin to consider the possibilities of what Salt's up to, where the script's headed, and you figure out what the big twist at the end is going to be. Or maybe I just got lucky. Probably the biggest obstacle that writers of psychological thrillers face is the plot corner, where they've made things so intricate that they can't write themselves out of their own traps. Here, there are only a few possible outcomes, so it's not too tough to figure out what will eventually happen - the trick is that Noyce and Wimmer make getting to that eventuality a rough, perilous journey.All in all, Salt is the kind of movie that, say, Eagle Eye or Repo Men or State of Play or even Knight and Day wish they were. It's expertly directed by Noyce, who also has given us Patriot Games and the overlooked Rabbit Proof Fence and features a powerful performance by Angelina Jolie. Oh, and in case there was any doubt, it's sequel-ready.",8,7,18,23 July 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Satire with a leaky front tire still runs okay
","From the wiseass mind that brought you Knocked Up, Balls of Fury, and the 40-Year-Old Virgin comes this parody biopic that's mostly based on the recent Johnny cash movie Walk the Line. With a whimsical, winning performance by John C. Reilly, Judd Apatow's mock tribute to hard and fast livin' rockers is a knowing smackdown (albeit gently) of the tried-and-true, rags-to-riches Horatio Alger story. Hey, they mock because they love.Dewey Cox (Reilly) grows up in the Deep South, and owing to a family tragedy (not unlike Cash's, only much, much funnier), finds himself with a paw who doesn't believe in him (and, uh, no brother). So off to cut a record with his bandmates, played by Chris Parnell, Tim Meadows, and Matt Besser. (Meadows' character in particular is a hoot, always getting hooked on the next big drug). And then get married and father five or so kids. And then fall in love with a backup singer named Darlene (Jenna Fischer, who's a complete doppleganger for Amy Adams, I swear), who he naturally marries. While still married to the first one. And so on.He even meets Elvis (poorly impersonated by Jack White of the White Stripes), The Big Bopper, and even Buddy Holly (an improbable Frankie Muniz). Oh, and he goes to India to rap with the Maharishi along with the Beatles, who are played by four recognizable names - but they're so unrecognizable that they need to refer to each other (along with Dewey) by their full names. (Seriously. The impressions are so bad that they sound like they were written by someone who'd merely heard mention of the Fab Four at some point and never read anything about them.) There's plenty of drug references and some nudity, but what I like most are the running jokes. As with the Cash flick, Dewey destroys a sink when he gets upset. Okay, make that six sinks. And he steps in as a last-minute replacement for an established act - in an all-black exotic club. Imagine a good ol' boy on a stage, cracking wise to rowdy black folk, and then he steps right into a race-laced tune! Reilly himself sings a lot of the songs (he even co-wrote some of them), and the man has some singing chops (remember Chicago?). He really has to, in order for the film to work at all. Sure, it's a comedy, but a movie about a bad musician isn't entertaining - kind of like a movie about a bad comedian. Such a movie would be funny in parts, but whenever the performer was on the stage, you'd just cringe and hope for the best. So Reilly, as Dewey, has to be spot on, and he is.Despite a slowish first half, this is what you'd call an agreeable waste of time. The closing musical sequence (it's set at an all-star tribute to Dewey) is a real knockout - as it should be. It's reminiscent of the 35th Anniversary special staged to honor Bob Dylan back in the 90s, with various acts covering Cox's best (Jewel, Eddie Vedder, Jackson Browne, and Ghostface Killah all appear). But the final number, a solo by Cox, is a real heart - and show - stopper, and this more than makes up for the sluggish (even by the numbers, as far as parodies go) start.",7,0,2,16 June 2008
The Patriot," Revolution #2
","Perhaps director Roland Emmerich is trying to make up for Godzilla, which he also directed. Perhaps he's trying to show us all that the success of Independence Day wasn't just a result of magnificent special effects and a hefty budget. At any rate, Emmerich was taking on quite a challenge, for the last American Revolution movie was that 1985 Al Pacino disaster 'Revolution'. 1776 never seemed so distant as when Al donned that furry hat and passed himself off as an 18th-century trader. Oh, sure, with that accent, no less.This time around, there's a foreigner at the fore. Mel Gibson's from Australia, as some of you might know. Wouldn't know it to hear him speak, of course, with an American accent that's more fluid than anything most of us will ever use in our own lifetimes. Get Mel behind closed doors, though, and I suspect he's all ready to put a shrimp on the ol' barbie. Here, of course, he's as American as he always is in the cinema. Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, calm farmer, hero of the French and Indian War. Legend has it that Martin went crazy at Fort Wilderness (not the place in Disney World, I soon discovered) and killed a bunch of bad guys. But now he's older and wiser, and he's darn sure he won't be laying to arms against any ol' Redcoats, taxes or no taxes. He's got something like nine kids to feed, all by himself (all you single moms out there, feel free to either commiserate or express your outrage). Well, things tend to change quickly in movies, even if the movie's 160 minutes long (ouch!). Before too long, Ben's pitchfork-deep in the melee, helping the colonials to defeat the British, who are represented (rather haughtily, of course) by Lord Cornwallis. Those of you who remember your history know that eventually (WARNING! WARNING! PLOT ENDING REVEALED! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU LIKE SURPRISES ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, WHICH OCCURRED OVER 220 YEARS AGO!)
Cornwallis surrenders, and the colonists win their freedom. Ah, but half the fun is getting there, right? Luckily, the movie doesn't bog us down with historical details such as battles, dates, etc. Remember Braveheart, that movie with an Australian playing the part of a Scotsman who rallies his people to revolt? This movie's not like that at all, since we have an Australian playing the part of an American who rallies his people to revolt. But while both films are completely different (!), let's look at some wonderful similarities. Disorganized rabble? Check. Evil despot? Check. Gallons and gallons of spilled blood per person? Check. Gratuitous violence? Check and double check!If this were viewed as a historical drama, there would be all sorts of problems with the accuracy of the plot (in fact, the British complained loud and often when the movie premiered, something about it portraying them as evil despots bent on world dominance, or something). Luckily, most of us don't care a whit about such stuff and nonsense, so we look at this movie to show us action. Pounds and pounds of action, preferably in the form of senseless violence. I mean there are decapitations! Who wouldn't want to see that? Many people, of course, but not too many - this film kicked butt at the box office. As a morality tale of sticking to your guns, the film loses its way a little, I think. Benjamin Martin goes against his beliefs for some pretty solid reasons, but after he takes the plunge, all bets are off and we have a straightforward action movie. But as a chance to see Mel strut his hero stuff, it's golden",7,1,2,7 November 2000
Silver Linings Playbook," A book with plenty of tricks up its sleeve
","Silver Linings Playbook, by David O. Russell, is one of those movies with a protagonist whom you fervently wish can overcome his demons but whose methods and goals you cannot easily reconcile. The movie is witty, foul-mouthed, very poignant, elegant, and, of course, odd.Pat (Bradley Cooper, playing way against type) has just been released from an eight-month mental-health-facility. His doctors are reluctant, but his mother (Jacki Weaver) insists he's better and that the place is, well, no place for him. She brings Pat back home to live with her and Pat's father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro), hoping that after eight months Pat will be able to get his life back in order once again.Pat, though, has other plans. He had been committed to the hospital because he violently beat a fellow teacher whom he had caught in the shower with his wife. Okay, so he snapped - he was lucky that hospital care was all he got. In any event, what he wants to do now is reconcile with his wife and resume his life. Sure, there's a restraining order, which is why he goes to the trouble of reading the books she teaches in her English class, anything to prove he's more mentally fit. Oh, during his stay he loses a lot of weight (apparently), something his then-wife had harped on. (Note: She sounds like a winner to me.)Things do not go as planned. For one thing, Pat never takes his medication (he's bipolar), which leads to the occasional angry outburst; the song that had been played at his wedding and was played while his wife took her infamous shower is now a trigger for more violent behavior, even when he doesn't hear it. He wants badly to make amends, but he's aiming in the wrong direction, as his ex shows no signs of wishing to see him again.To help him along, friends Ronnie and Veronica ask Pat over to dinner, and they invite Veronica's iconoclastic sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has social skills that are below even Pat's. The dinner isn't exactly a disaster, but Tiffany leaves abruptly and has Pat walk her home. A kindred friendship is born.Although the reason for Tiffany's behavior is somewhat important to the plot, I won't mention it here, but somehow she sees something in Pat, something honest, someone she can relate to. Meanwhile, Pat Sr., a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan, considers his son to be a lucky charm and practically begs Pat to stay and watch the game with him on Sundays. Pat Sr. desperately wishes to reconnect with his son (there's a recurring theme), but Pat is ambivalent. To cope with his own emotions, he jogs. A lot.The emotional tug of war, punctuated by the Pat's own inability to control himself (still no meds for him) begins to ebb a little when Tiffany makes him a deal: she'll do something for him (not spoiling) and in exchange he will be her dance partner. You see, Tiffany studies dance as a way to cope with her demons, and there's a gala competition coming up - but one cannot compete without a partner, and she has nobody. Even her parents are wary of her. So that's the deal.So on the one hand you have Pat Sr. believing his son is a lucky charm and wanting to spend more time with him anyway, and on the other hand you have Tiffany, who offers to help Pat achieve his overall goal if he'll help her. There's a lot of bickering back and forth among everyone; that is, when there's no jogging involved (note: there's plenty).Okay, enough about the plot; I'll stop before I do give something away. Let's look at the performances. Cooper is exceptional. We've seen him be kind of a jerk in The Hangover and a ladies' man in The A Team, and here he is as a completely conflicted man who desperately wishes to reach a goal for which he's striven for eight months. His is a raw, laid-bare performance. Lawrence is truly stunning as the somewhat-unstable Tiffany. She's passionate, angry, caring, bitter, sweet, and she possesses even more charisma than she did in The Hunger Games or Winter's Bone. Her jaw- dropping work here is very much deserving of award recognition; Tiffany can be brutal and brittle and still completely endearing. It's the best work Lawrence has done in her short but strong career.Surprisingly to me, though, the standout in this cast is DeNiro. Now, DeNiro has been sort of phoning it in for a few years now, with the exception (perhaps) of movies like Limitless and Stardust. But here he really shines; it's possibly his best work since at least the 1990s. I've seen tough guys on camera get emotional, and often it just doesn't work. They can't sell it. There's a rare breed of actor who can do the macho angle and the sensitive angle and do it justice, and DeNiro, particularly here, pulls it off. Pat Sr., himself an emotional fellow, is a man full of love and passion and a man who is not without some regrets on how he's raised his kids. DeNiro brings all of that out flawlessly.Silver Linings Playbook is not a lighthearted movie. It's compelling drama led by a cast composed of relative neophytes and grizzled veterans. It's quirky, just like its director, and it is a clear-cut winner. Here's the best thing I can say about the movie: It feels authentic. When someone is hurt, I feel bad for them; I don't feel that they're staging it. The script is original and idiosyncratic, and every morsel of every scene is one to cherish.",9,5,10,5 January 2013
Monsters vs. Aliens," Must see in 3D
","Who do you root for when it’s aliens versus monsters, anyway? This isn’t like Aliens versus Predator, where no matter who won, we lost. OK, time’s up - it’s monsters. The monsters - the Missing Link, Dr. Cockroach, Ginormica, B.O.B., and Insectosaurus - are on our side, helping to defend Earth from the dastardly intentions of one Gallaxahar.Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) is searching for an element called quantonium, which he believes will make him superpowerful or something. Some quantonium has landed on Earth in the form of a meteorite. A meteorite that lands on Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) right before her wedding, causing her to grow to enormous proportions! Soon the military catches her and imprisons her with other caught monsters from over the past fifty years. And then when Gallaxhar sends a massive robot probe to Earth, a probe that is invulnerable to all attacks, only one group of mostly inhumanoids can save the day! In addition to Susan, now known as Ginormica, there’s B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), a gelatinous blob; Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) , a roach-human hybrid; The Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gill-man; and Insectosaurus, a giant - and I mean giant - grub. Bound together by a thirst for justice and fresh air, they “agree” to fight back against the robot probe.Couple of things to note here. First, although this is a PG-rated film, there’s a notable use of the word “boobies.” As a male adult, I think it’s awesome that such a word has finally made into kiddie fare, although the fact that I have no kids probably plays into that a little bit. Still, I don’t think it bothered the sold-out crowd in the theater; at least there were no audible gasps. Also, the violence, because it’s in 3D - yes!! - is a little more intense than for a 2D movie, since it’s all in your face and such. Again, I don’t think it affected the kidlets negatively.Another thing to note is that Seth Rogen is a comedic genius. Fans of his live-action stuff have known that for a while, of course, and now the kids will, too, if they know he’s the voice behind B.O.B., who falls for a plate of Jell-O at one point. Rogen’s comic timing is hilariously on key, and he always sounds as if he’s having the time of his life.Reese Witherspoon (like Rene Zellweger in Bee Movie), as Susan, is a sweet, engaging voice actress as well. Her bemusement as she struggles with her sudden height - she uses cars as roller skates - is entertaining. There are also some slight nods to other movies; the President (played memorably by Stephen Colbert) plays the famous five notes from Close Encounters of the Third Kind before showing the Vulcan hand sign. And when the military attacks the probe, one plane has “ET GO HOME” painted on its side.This is definitely a movie that makes good use of 3D technology, and it’s one that viewed in 2D would seem pedestrian. It’s not quite a classic, but there are plenty of good jokes - particularly from Rogen - and it’s well cast. The kids will enjoy it, and it’s another in a line of enjoyable DreamWorks animated features.",7,2,6,29 March 2009
Dreamgirls," Delightful numbers, Hudson, Murphy excellent
","After you cut through the electrifying songs and dazzling choreography in Bill Condon's story of a Detroit girl band struggling to succeed in the sixties and seventies, you're left with a fairly typical rise-and-fall story, but because of the powerful performances turned in by the phenomenal Jennifer Hudson (who won an Oscar) and the dynamic Eddie Murphy (who was nominated for one), the movie rises above typical showbiz biopics, even the fake ones.The Dreamettes are Effie (Hudson), a bombastic diva with a strong voice; Deena (Beyonce Knowles), a willowy, softer touch; and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), the youngest of the bunch. They're not succeeding on the local talent-show circuit, so they hook up with the famed James 'Thunder' Early (Murphy) to perform as his backup singers, which doesn't sit too well with Effie. They're coached along by Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx), who attempts to mold them into crossover artists, leaving the placid world of the R&B charts behind for the bigger fame and fortune of the nationwide pop charts.Naturally, as some stars rise, others must fall. Early's great, and wildly charismatic, but he's not always what Curtis wants in a star who can appeal to a wide audience. Sowing the seeds of his own destruction, Jimmy falls prey to the usual pitfalls of stardom - money, drugs, and the knowledge that he's no longer the man of the moment. Meanwhile, the Dreamettes are persevering, first as his backup trio and then on their own, conquering what was somewhat deprecatingly called the chitlin circuit. Curtis has grander plans, though; he wants his charges to eventually play Miami, a place far away from Detroit, a place where, as Curtis tells Jimmy, they won't even let black people wait on tables. (Remember, this is in the early sixties.) The movie is based on a Broadway musical, so the songs and choreography - all wonderful - are derived directly from the stage presentation; this may seem a little strange, because given the setting (Motown in the sixties), it seems like there should be bona fide R&B hits coming at you, although admittedly a lot of the songs do sound similar to chart-toppers from that time. In fact, the fashion styles and the songs remind you very strongly of some (figurative) heavyweights in the field at that time: Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross. (It's been said that the Dreamgirls were supposed to be The Supremes, but the movie was merely inspired by the real-life Supremes, which explains why there aren't more real-life names bandied about in the movie; it's not biographical story.) There's no question that Hudson, in her first role, and Murphy, the longtime comedy-film veteran, truly sparkle in their roles and were each deservedly nominated for Academy Awards (Hudson won; Murphy lost to Alan Arkin). As for Hudson - she can SING. I mean, she belts out the tunes with a fantastic mixture of passion, guts, and anger, as best befitting her largely (no pun intended) unhappy character, Effie. And when you watch Murphy, you completely forget he once recorded a song called '(My Girl Wants to) Party All the Time,' and the singer he most reminds you of is James Brown. He's spectacular.Not so spectacular was Foxx as Curtis Taylor; he was far too low key and, well, morose. He's somewhat believable in turning from a naif in the music world to a cutthroat businessman, but he lacks the screen presence - the panache - to really pull it off. Denzel Washington was reportedly offered the role but declined on the grounds that he can't sing - although I'm sure dubbing wouldn't have made a huge difference.Still, it's not much to carp about. The songs are perfect, and the final number is a huge showstopper that'll leave you clapping for more.",7,0,0,29 July 2007
Being John Malkovich," Weird movie, but in a good way!
","After seeing this film, the first word that came to my mind was 'weird.' This is a WEIRD movie. But! I mean that in a good way. For one thing, it's very original, and that's certainly something that's been lacking in Hollywood for a long time. It's about this talented, down-on-his-luck puppeteer (John Cusack)who accepts a meaningless job for a company that operates on the 7 1/2 floor (you have to see it to believe it, trust me) and discovers in his office a portal that takes him to the mind of actor John Malkovich. Not to Malkovich's HOUSE, mind you, not to his office, but into his actual mind. Yes folks, it's an existential conundrum of a movie. What's it like to be John Malkovich, you wonder? Watch and learn, Gentle Viewer, watch and learn. We see John in the morning, making himself some breakfast, we see him rehearsing at a local theater, we see him hitting on the ladies, and we see him commiserating with Charlie Sheen, of all people (I didn't even know they ran in the same circles!). But being in John Malkovich's head is only one of the issues at hand - how this all affects the puppeteer's girl (an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz) and his newfound partner (Catherine Keener) and how THEY interact is even more intriguing. This isn't a movie the likes of which you've seen before, you see. Just when you think you have stuff figured out and you can settle down and gnaw on some stale pretzels, something else weird happens to make you have to rethink it again.This is certainly not a movie for all tastes, just as 'Eraserhead' wasn't a movie you'd recommend to everyone you know. If you're a fan of the offbeat, the odd, or the downright weird, here's your movie. Enjoy!",9,1,2,19 February 2000
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Dull in most spots, although Catherine Keener is great
","As the clever title might indicate, Steve Carell (late of Anchorman and 'The Daily Show') plays a man who's sort of missed out on the amorous adventures of one's youth. Carell is Andy Stitzer, a low-wage lackey at a Circuit City-type store who ashamedly reveals to his three coworkers that he has yet to do the deed. Naturally, they view this as a challenge.Andy's never really grown up, as evidenced by his extensive video game and action figure collections and his habit of riding a bicycle to work every day. He never interacts with anyone outside work, so when he's asked to play poker with his coworkers, Andy accepts. Imagine his embarrassment when he's kind of forced to admit his 'problem.' Andy's stereotypical in many ways, which allows the audience to identify with him somewhat. We've all either been or known That Guy, the one who was still as dorky as an adult as he was in high school. Andy's extensive 'toy' collection is his pride and joy, and one look around his small apartment indicates a stage of arrested development. It's not that Andy's not a nice guy, of course; that's actually the trouble. He never had much (any) luck with the ladies when he was younger, and as he's aged he's more or less given up on the whole idea. Too old, you see.Various plans are hatched, but the lady who catches Andy's eye is Trish (Catherine Keener), who owns a shop across from Andy's store. Trish is an older woman (at least compared with the ladies that Andy's buddies at work are trying to set him up with), and she seems to sincerely dig the someone naïve Andy. But is there relationship doomed? Will Andy confess to Trish that he's still untouched? I like Steve Carell, especially his fantastic Daily Show work, but I think he's a little underwhelming here. Carell doesn't act so much as react to the madness around him. That might work with some actors in some movies (such as when the chaos is continuously and uproariously funny), but the result here is a sometimes-sluggish mishmash of scattershot jokes and pathos.The real shining star of the movie is Keener, who's practically unrecognizable as Trish. You might remember her from Being John Malkovich - the slinky sexuality of Maxine gives way to the earthy-dreamy concoction of Trish - and she's as spot on here as she was in that one. Some day, Keener will earn an Academy award. It won't be for this movie, though.Andy's coworkers and other supporting characters are okay, if not particularly developed. You have the pervy guy, the flashy hip black guy, and the guy who's constantly bemoaning his ex, who dumped him two years ago. All bring a little something to the puzzle that is this film, but none of the pieces fit all that well.For what looked like a laugh-a-minute comedy about a poor schlub who's about to get off the schneid, Virgin is disappointingly slow in spots; Carell simply doesn't lend enough gravitas to the lead role to be particularly interesting.The 40 Year Old Virgin: **",5,6,13,8 September 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Uinspiring waste
","A drab shell of a movie, The Men Who Stare at Goats has a little humor, a little drama, and a little action, but too little of any one thing to warrant a second look. It's aimless and largely laughless, despite a top-name cast.Ewan McGregor plays a small-time U.S. journalist named Bob Wilton, who meets a man named Lyn Cassady, played by George Clooney, to claims to have taken part in a secret army unit that trained in the use of paranormal abilities to help win the war through fairly peaceful means, in a program called the New Earth Army. Cassady believes he's been given a mission by the group's leader, Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), so he heads into Iraq with Bob in tow.Truly, it's entertaining to see George Clooney, well, act, but despite his efforts here and his chemistry with McGregor (great swaths of the movie are of the buddy-pic variety), it's a doomed, wasted performance. Wilton and Cassady run into the sort of troubles you'd expect a single U.S. soldier and a journalist to run into in Iraq, including getting taken hostage by a mercenary 'security' detail that's ostensibly there to help keep the peace. Where's it all leading? Well, no place special, it turns out.Director Grant Heslov has trouble weaving the various tones and atmospheres together into a cogent movie. Cassady seems like a nice guy who may or may not have actual psychic abilities; Wilton seems befuddled or paranoid almost all of the time. Bridges is spacey; Kevin Spacey is a venomous coparticipant in the New Agey program. But they all seem to be in different movies.Many references are made to Jedi Knights, that the men who were in the New Earth Army – which is as hippy-dippy as it gets – are the peaceful warriors who use their mind tricks to win hearts and minds. Of course, McGregor himself appeared in three Star Wars films as a Jedi Knight, which makes one wonder if the producers scanned their Rolodexes for actors who had been actual virtual Jedi Knights already. Hooray for serendipity, huh? At any rate, Cassady is supposed to be on the Good Side of the Force (which isn't mentioned by name, but you know that's what they meant), and Spacey's Larry Hooper is supposed to be on the Dark Side – probably because he wants to use psychic powers for violent means. But rest assured, there's no killing (of humans) to be done in this movie using thinking caps.So what is the point? It's an interesting story that Bob gets to tell his readers, but it feels a little underdeveloped here. The movie would have been better if it had stuck to a particular tone, whether it was slapstick or a straight-forward action movie. Either would have helped form a more cohesive plot. What we get instead was a jumble of personalities and factory-seconds puzzle pieces; it's as if the movie wanted to be existential and concrete at the same time. Call it Schroedinger's Movie.",4,4,9,26 June 2010
Shrek Forever After," Please be the last one
","The Shrek series is ending at least two movies too late. The first two were plenty of fun, but the third one was merely okay and this final one is just tepid, sleepwalking through its own milieu with a script that seems to have had all the jokes removed.As movie series progress, the makers must come up with new situations for their protagonists to experience. So here, Shrek makes a deal with Rumplestiltskin that alters the timelines of him and everyone else in Far, Far Away: he gets one day in which to live as a regular old ogre, just like before he met Fiona and Donkey; in return, Rumplestiltskin gets one of Shrek's days for himself. Turns out he chooses the day the big green fella was born, which (obviously) means a new timeline in which he never saved Fiona from the castle (among other things).It's almost a crutch, having a main character live his life in an alternate timeline, because that way you can have that main character re-meet all his friends. It's like getting a second origin story. And sure enough, we meet several of the characters from the earlier films, such as Pinocchio, the Gingerbread Man, and the Three Little Pigs, not to mention Donkey's red-dragon wife. And naturally, because everyone in this timeline is used to a world in which Rumplestiltskin is large and in charge, Shrek needs to do a little convincing. Not the least of which is to Fiona herself, because – as the ironclad contract with Rumple notes – only true love's kiss can break the deal.The thing I liked most about the first couple of Shrek movies was the unending patter of jokes. Lots of pop-culture references (anachronistically), many of which worked. Lots of gross-out gags, too. And great chemistry between characters, even though they'd just met. It all sort of clicked then, but none of that is apparent in this fourth installment. The humor is, at best, scattershot – and not in the Airplane! style, either, where characters make seemingly hundreds of jokes a minute, with some working and some not. It almost feels as if there were a joke quota here, only it's a maximum of two per reel.Shrek 4 is charmless, too. I know we're supposed to root for Shrek (and the ending isn't unsatisfying), but his adventures trying to get his true love's kiss are sometimes tedious and uninspired. The problem here is that Shrek the character is supposed to be a grouchy bastard, but he's typically offset by the wild extrovertism of Donkey and the sweetness of Fiona. And since this alternate timeline indicates that neither has met Shrek, neither gets to balance out his irascible behavior.There were plenty of little tykes in the theater this morning, and I didn't really hear a lot of oohs and ahhs or laughs. It could be that Shrek Forever After failed to be broad enough in its humor and yet too intense in its action to appeal to its core audience. The series can finally rest.",4,1,3,9 June 2010
Collateral," Unsatisfying
","Max (Jamie Foxx) is a morose, temporary (for 12 years) cabbie who picks up an unusual fare: For $600, he'll ferry Vincent (Tom Cruise) around to various real estate deals. Small problem, though: Turns out Vincent's deals are actually hits. That might cost extra on the meter.Michael Mann's dark action film is mainly a two-character study of the hijacked Max and the confident Vincent. Will Max ever get the psychological upper hand on Vincent? Who will win out? Will Vincent complete his 'rounds'? The other characters are merely background decorations, for the most part, as this is a batter of wits between a cold master and a warm, pensive dreamer.Critics have raved about this movie, especially about Foxx's performance and about Cruise's ability to disappear into a character. I can't agree with the latter of those two assessments. To me, Tom Cruise never stopped being Tom Cruise. You can whiten his beard and give him a salt-and-pepper mane, but you can never completely take away the very distinct Cruise mannerisms. You can never, in other words, completely forget Vincent is Tom Cruise, Movie Star, and that's where the movie really suffers. I believe Cruise was miscast in this movie, because another, less-mannered actor would have given a much more-nuanced performance.Foxx, on the other hand, was perfectly cast, and this (along with Ray) is surely a breakthrough role for the former In Living Color vet. Foxx immerses himself so much in his character that one completely empathizes with Max's plight. We understand when he's uncertain about calling Annie, the lawyer who was the fare before Vincent. We know where he's coming from when he's asked to do reprehensible things by Vincent over the course of the long evening. We never have to stop and ask ourselves why Max is doing something, or - more appropriately - why Max isn't doing something to stop Vincent.There are some holes in the story itself, which never bodes well when the movie is as plot dependent; even worse, though, is that the plot - particularly the ending - seems far too contrived and tidy for the people involved. Things happen in the movie that would be considered mere coincidences in real life, but here they look manipulated.Because of this, Collateral was a disappointment to me. Even if one sawed through the hype of the movie ('Ooh look! It's Tom Cruise looking old!') and took it at face value, the plot contrivances and hamminess of Cruise ultimately sink it, at least to some degree. It's not a wholly unentertaining movie, as it's fun to watch Cruise and Foxx interact. It's just not as satisfying as it should have been.",5,4,7,31 December 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Fun, dark ride
","If you enjoyed the first two movies, be warned: There are plenty of differences in this third installment. With a new director on board (Alfonso Cuaron), the tone of the series has shifted somewhat, to a darker, more serious Harry Potter universe.If you've read the books, you should also be warned: There's a lot of stuff in the third book that doesn't appear in the third movie. Part of this is out of necessity, as this film is a bit shorter than the first two (while the book is longer), but even so there are characters from the book who don't appear in the movie and story threads that aren't satisfactorily resolved.The crux of the story is that the man who led Lord Voldemort to Harry's parents, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban Prison, presumably to hunt down the offspring of his onetime close friends - and kill him! The guards at Azkaban, the Dementors, are out in full force to track down Black and return him to prison. Ah, but these are no ordinary guards; the Dementors - dark, faceless beings in black cloaks - feed off a person's emotions, eventually sucking their soul out, rending them helpless. The Dementors personify depression in the extreme, you see.Harry first encounters the Dementors on the way to school aboard the Hogwarts Express as they search the train for Black. It's not an enjoyable encounter for the boy wizard, who faints dead away.Later, at the school, it's learned that Black is getting closer and closer. Will he find Harry?New to the faculty at Hogwarts are Remus Lupin as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor (a position that is empty at the end of each book) and Sybil Trelawney as the Divination professor. Both figured into the plot of the book, but only Lupin gets any real screen time in the movie. Lupin, played with effortless panache by David Thewlis, winds up being a confidante of Harry, and he has more than a few secrets in his closet as well. Also, taking the place of the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore is Michael Gambon, while Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) is promoted to the position of professor.There are two main plotlines at work here: the anticipation of the arrival of Black and the revelations of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Harry's parents. We learned a bit at the end of each of the first two HP films, and this one too takes its sweet time in clueing us all in.A new director and tone can lead to some dangerous uncharted waters, and expectations must be tempered somewhat. Please do go to this movie expecting the charm of the first two; this is not your older brother's HP. As Harry himself matures, so must his movies, and this one is more cynical and downbeat at times than either of the first two in the series. This matches, at least somewhat, the tenor of the third book itself.Cuaron's direction is excellent, and his little touches are abundant (such as the rearranging of the Hogwarts grounds, the use of the Whomping Willow as a device to show time, and endless presence of a giant outdoors clock). The movie doesn't lag too much, although it's possible that a newcomer to the HP oeuvre might not pick up all of the plot threds.The cast does a good job, I think, in maintaining the spirit of the previous movies and books. The young lead trio (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) are aging quite well; in fact, I think Watson is becoming quite a wonderful young actress. (Grint, by the way, holds his hamminess down to a dull roar.)They're well supported, of course, by a who's who of master British thespians, from Thompson to Thewlis to Alan Rickman (still delightfully creepy as Snape) to Gambon to Maggie Smith to Coltrane. Any British actor who's anyone wants to be in these movies, and that's high praise indeed.The special effects, too, aren't second rate. Buckbeack the hippogriff looked positively realistic (although Crookshanks the cat looked laughable).HP:PoA is well worth watching, especially if you have little munchkins in your household who have been clamoring for it since the last Harry Potter movie. But beware, there are some scenes that the younguns may find a bit more unsettling than either of the first two movies.My score: ***1/2",8,0,0,6 June 2004
Now You See Me," Now you should see it again - what did you miss?
","Don't overthink it. That's my first advice to those who watch Now You See Me, an otherwise-terrific psychological thriller with a magical theme, in at least one sense of the word. The movie relies on the staple of the magician's act, the sleight of hand, as it repeatedly tells its audience that the closer one looks, the less likely they are to discover the secret. It's an axiom that can be applied to the movie as well. It's fast moving, competently acted, and contains genuine twists - especially the last one, which is a doozy.Our story begins with the solo acts of four magicians: the mentalist Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), the showman Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), the spoon-bender Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), and the stunt specialist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). After each concludes a performance, he or she finds a Tarot card directing them to a particular apartment building in New York. Behind that door, the fun begins.Some time later, the four - christened The Four Horsemen - perform a most unusual act in Las Vegas. Using a volunteer from the audience, they somehow manage to rob a bank in France. Ridiculous? Yes, of course it is - but there you are, nonetheless. The money is missing. What's more, it suddenly rains money into the crowd. Crowd goes wild. This, of course, gains the attention of not only the FBI, in the person of Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) but also Interpol, in the person of Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). How in the world did the money get from Paris to Vegas? Oh, this is only the beginning.Next up is New Orleans. This time, McKinney plays a fun little trick on the group's benefactor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine); he has everyone in the audience write down the amount that's presently in their bank account. Then he has the audience look at the number using a flashlight from under the seats. Meanwhile, the group brings out a giant check that lists Tressler's bank holdings. As time passes, the amount on Tressler's check declines, while those of audience members increase. How is this possible?Each time the FBI and Interpol think they've grabbed an ankle of the magicians, they've grabbed nothing more than thin air. Atlas and company are at least three steps ahead of everyone. But why? What is really behind all of this? What's the endgame?The key - and this is not a spoiler by any measure - is to bear this in mind: watch everything, but not too closely. There are clues everywhere. And when all is said and done, the last trick complete, the final twist may well shock you into silence. And I sort of like that. I love a movie that can pirouette from one direction to the next, a bit of sleight-of- hand, if you will, with the new direction just as plausible as the first. Misdirection is all afoot in this caper. It's all about what you look at but can't see.Now You See Me was cowritten by Boaz Yakin. Don't know the name? Well, he also wrote such luminous films as Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, Prince of Persia, Safe, and From Dusk Till Dawn 2. Not quite the pedigree you'd expect for this quality film. Maybe it's the artful direction of Louis Leterrier, who helmed the first two Transporter films and the Clash of the Titans remake. Not a lot of pizazz in that list, is there? Still, somehow, it works. Everything seems to click. The cast has great chemistry, and the performances are (mostly) nuanced just enough to stay out of the path of a gripping script. Eisenberg's Daniel is essentially the same as Eisenberg's MarK Zuckerberg - smug, cocky, supersmart. Harrelson's Merrit is condescending, a has-been with little going for him. Fisher's Henley, though underdeveloped, adds needed estrogen to the quartet - with the undercurrent of having worked with Daniel as his assistant. And Dave Franco - yes, Dave - is good as the youngest of the bunch; Franco is basically a clone of his older brother James, who I swore up and down this was. Huh. Ruffalo, Laurent, Common, Caine, and Morgan Freeman (as a professional debunker of magicians) round out the cast.One final note about this. Even after the all the magic, the heists, the twists, and the reveals, the very ending is ambiguous. It's like watching someone walk through a doorway without letting you see what's ahead; something has happened, something beyond the powers and will and even imagination of the magicians: something wonderful.",9,5,12,2 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," It's going to be tough to top this.
","X-Men: Days of Future Past sort of blew me away. And here's the kicker - you don't need to have seen the previous movies in the series to understand what's going on. There's an unerring blend of past and present characters, real heart-in-your-throat tension, and stunning effects. Yeah, so I sort of liked it a little bit.I don't mean to fawn, but sometimes it's appropriate. This is a great movie. In a nutshell, here's your story. It's sometime in the future (2029? not sure). The Sentinels, robots built with the sole purpose of eradicating all mutants, are on the rampage, tracking said mutants down and slaughtering them, full stop. In fact, they've become so advanced that when a mutant defends against/attacks a Sentinel, that mutant's powers are absorbed by that Sentinel. Get it? It's a bad scene. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellan), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and other assorted X people have holed up in the middle of nowhere, awaiting their doom. Xavier believes that the only way to stop the war on mutants (and on sympathetic humans, by the way, in case you missed the analogy) is to travel back in time to prevent the creation of the Sentinels in 1973. Now, Professor X wants to be sent back (don't worry, Kitty Pryde is on the job), but because of the long time period between '73 and the present, Pryde thinks the journey would snap even the Professor's mind. Instead, they opt to send Wolverine back, because he's essentially unchanged from 1973 (more-or- less ageless, really) and would therefore adjust better to the trip. And so back he goes.A solo, rogue mission by Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), in an effort to destroy Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), the creator of the Sentinels, merely gave the public and the government cause to turn on the mutants, thus sparking the war. So: Wolverine is to locate Mystique and persuade her to give up her cause, and he won't be able to do so without the help of...the younger Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Aye, there's the rub, huh? Older, wiser Magneto regrets fighting Charles Xavier all those years, but younger, angrier Magneto isn't so shrewd. (They're just like people!)So there's your setup. Young Magneto is being held secretly about 100 stories below the Pentagon in a super-ultra-mega-maximum security cell for the murder of...well, never mind. Young Xavier, on the other hand, is hiding out at his School for Gifted Youngsters, which no longer is a school nor houses youngsters, except for Beast, who helps his mentor faithfully. Thus the movie unites not only good mutants and bad mutants but younger and older versions of themselves, more or less. And because of the trippy time shenanigans, you could possibly see familiar mutants, from movies other than the First Class one. Sounds like this would make for a crowded cast, but the action centers around the younger Magneto and Xavier, Mystique, Wolverine, and the younger Beast (Nicholas Hoult). It feels so good to have Bryan Singer back behind the wheel. The story flows in sync with the dazzling, but not distracting, effects, as if a steady-handed auteur was in charge. This feels like the most authentic and personal X-Men film to date, and I (yeah, yeah) liked each of the others. And heaven forfend if I bust out a spoiler, but you know what they say about time-travel movies: they can change things, man.",9,1,2,25 May 2014
Saw III," AWESOME! and GROSS! and GREAT! and DISGUSTING!
","'Why should I see Saw III,' you ask, deftly avoiding yet another lame pun on the movie's title. 'I didn't see Saw or Saw II.' Well, first of all, if you didn't see those two, shame on you. I'll forgive you, of course, because I'm nice, but shame on you nonetheless. Both of the previous two Saw films are fantastic horror films, a real credit to the genre. I mean, they're eye-popping in their gore, but there's enough of a psychological undertone do always keep the audience guessing.It is, as you might surmise, the same with III. Only, heavy is the head that wears the crown; the team behind the Saw films are victims of their own creativity. It's one thing to churn out meaningless sequels when all you're doing is splattering nubile twits, but when you're following Saw and Saw II, you have to fight to reach the bar you've set for yourself.Luckily, James Wan and Leigh Whannell have done just that. The nefarious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back, and as we saw at the end of Saw II, he's not alone - his accomplice is the lovely, the twisted Amanda (Shawnee Smith). Near the beginning of the movie, we see a SWAT team burst into a room where one of Jigsaw's victims apparently exploded from one of the villain's diabolical traps. This might lead you to think the movie will be a cat and mouse game between Jigsaw and the cops, but this notion is quickly quelled when the lead investigator becomes a Jigsaw victim herself.Jigsaw is all about games, of course, so although it takes a little while to get there we finally get to the story's main game. A young man wakes up in a large wooden box; he eventually is forced through several 'tests,' each of which is somehow related to the death of the man's son in an auto accident. Can the man (played by Angus McFadyen of Braveheart) face his inner demons by way of these tests (Jigsaw's games carry a moralistic theme)? Meanwhile, as we saw at the end of Saw II, Jigsaw isn't doing so well, physically speaking, so he enlists (er, coerces) a pretty, young, driven doctor (Bahar Soomekh) to keep him alive. Oh, and to entice her to do just that, he has Amanda fit the doctor with a special collar. He wouldn't be Jigsaw without his collars! I may have given away a little too much already, you're thinking, but there's so many twists and turns and sudden shocks that it shouldn't matter much at all. The movie is chock full of pulse-quickening, heart-pounding horrors, from the creeping-up-on-you kind to the WHAM HITTING YOU IN THE FACE WITH A SHOVEL kind; that is, director Darren Lynn Bousman is quite adept at manipulating the pace of the movie to freak you the heck out. Do you like closeups of oozing blood? Limbs and sinews bursting? How about brain surgery, do you have an affinity for that? I wouldn't recommend the movie if you're the kind who has to run from the theater when a needle punctures skin, or if you're pregnant - a couple of these jolting scenes might induce labor.Saw III is the latest in what's become the new wave of horror movies: lower-budget films with small, unknown casts that are heavy on shock and plot rather than special effects and pizazz. If you enjoyed any of the previous two Saw films and/or Hostel, if you think watching an autopsy would be a wonderful first date, then Saw III shouldn't cause you much worry - well, maybe other than holding your hand in front of your face sometimes. Not that I ever did that.The ultimate question, of course, is whether there will be a Saw IV, since a recent trend is for movie series to contain only three films. I cannot unequivocally say that there will not be a fourth entry, because although the end does seem final, there is at least one major loose end that could be explored.",8,2,5,30 October 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Three casinos. A lot of security. Eleven guys. $150 million. No problem.
","Thank goodness for popcorn movies. Okay, so this one doesn't completely qualify, as at certain moments during the film the brain is encouraged to wake up and breathe a little, but it's still an exciting escapist movie. The plot centers around a massive heist - three major casinos in Las Vegas, all robbed simultaneously. The ringleader is Danny Ocean (George Clooney), recently sprung from the big house. He has an ulterior motive for robbery (well, other than the $150 million); seems his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who left him while he was in stir, is now with the owner of the three casinos, Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), a suave, cool, egomaniac. He looks like he's been patterned after Steve Wynn, who owned (still does, probably) many casinos in the desert and who was always at odds with his eastern rival, Donald Trump.
So Danny's out, and he has a plan. Plans are always good. He first recruits old pal Dusty (Brad Pitt), who's busy teaching poker to nincompoop Hollywood actors. Dusty and Danny get together the rest of the gang, sprawled all over the country, including the Malloy brothers (Scott Caan and Casey Affleck); Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), a novice whose dad worked with Danny; Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner!); demolitionist Roscoe Means (Don Cheadle, sporting one heck of a cockney accent); Yen the acrobat (Shaobo Qin); Frank the blackjack dealer (Bernie Mac); and their financial backer, Ruben Tischkoff (Elliott Gould!). It's a game cast, and it looked like they all had a lot of fun making the movie. I was surprised to see old hands Reiner and Gould in this one, especially since so many Gen-X people are involved. Reiner's character is a lot like that of Lawrence Tierney in Reservoir Dogs, except that Sol's not in charge of anything (and, in fact, has to be coaxed out of retirement). And Gould looked to have put on about 70 pounds - whether that's padding or he put it on for the movie, I'll never know. The rest of the cast did a fine job. The best performances were by Pitt, Damon, and Clooney. But Julia Roberts - well, she had no chemistry with the man she was with (Garcia), none with the man she had been with before (Clooney), and none with the camera. In fact, she looked terrible in closeup, as if someone had strapped her down and injected her lips with about 10,000 cc's of collagen. I know she has full lips, but sheesh! Plus they were supercoated with this Mary Kay lipstick that only served to enhance the gaudy image.This takes the basic plot of the original 1960 movie (starring the Rat Pack, with Sinatra in the lead) and reworks it a little. It's more stylish, more elegant, more thrilling than the original, and how often can one say that?
But of course the real story's the caper. They have to bust into the vault, get this money - and it's in CASH, mind you - and walk out. No one's ever come close. This is a movie where you definitely have no problem rooting for the good guys. It's part robbery thriller, part Robin Hood, part Mission:Impossible. It's well-written, although it's not as multilayered a film as some of Steven Soderbergh's other movies, such as Traffic, Out of Sight (with Clooney), Erin Brockovich (with Roberts), or even sex, lies, and videotape. But it really is a blast.",8,0,0,13 December 2001
Tropic Thunder," Sly Thunder, despite Tom Cruise
","Here's the big difference between Ben Stiller and Tom Cruise: Stiller possesses self-awareness, and Cruise does not. Oh, Cruise may attempt self-parody, but he never gives you the impression that he is aware he's making fun of himself - he seems to be saying, 'Hey, I'm an actor, look at me act!' I've mocked Stiller many times. The guy's a ham, he's a bad actor, and his whiny, petulant behavior in almost every movie is annoying. But he does have a sense of what's funny. For example, when I popped Night at the Museum into the DVD player, I was sure it was going to be full of inept jokes and overexaggerated characterizations, and I was happily surprised, because he was the normalized center of a chaotic maelstrom.And I will further admit that I had reservations about Tropic Thunder as well, since Stiller directed, co-wrote, and coproduced it. This can't end well, I thought, even with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jack Black along for the ride. But it IS good, and for an entirely different reason from Night at the Museum: Stiller, playing an overmuscled action hero, sends up not only the Rambos of the world but also his own high-maintenance, tightly wound on screen (and off) persona. He points and laughs at himself so that we may join in, and that's a level of self-awareness that only those with impeccable comic cred can pull off.The story of Tropic Thunder goes like this. A director (Steve Coogan) of a big-budget Vietnam War movie, tiring of dealing with his prima donna stars (Stiller, Black, Downey, Jr.), allows the grizzled veteran (Nick Nolte) who wrote the book on which the movie is based to move the film shoot to the jungles of Vietnam, where the actors will be dropped to fight the real North Vietnamese in a prime, and punny, example of guerrilla film-making.Apologies for that run-on sentence. Let me put on my Movie Voice-over Guy hat: 'They came from a world in which they held all the cards. Now they find... they're all jokers.' You can't beat Movie Voice-over Guy for plot summaries.Everyone is perfectly cast. Stiller's character is coming off a series of action-franchise movies of declining quality and popularity. Black plays an Eddie Murphy clone in that he's best known for playing multiple characters in flatulence-embracing comedies. Downey, Jr. is an Australian superactor who's won five Oscars and who prepares for this movie by getting controversial pigmentation surgery to look like an African American. I know, I know, it sounds like he's dressing in black face, which is obviously and patently racist, especially in this day and age. Downey, Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus is known as a Method actor, a guy who gets deep, deep, deep into his roles, so he doesn't just walk the walk, he also talks the talk. Dude never breaks character.But this isn't just a high-octane movie with pithy punchlines; it's a raunchy ensemble piece peppered with perfectly knowing, crisp dialog. Black, Downey, Jr., and Stiller all work very well together, and since they're essentially playing actor archetypes, you can easily buy what they're selling.On a hugely positive note, check out the fake trailers before the actual movie of the most recent films completed by the lead actors's actors. On a hugely negative note, check out an almost unrecognizable Cruise as a studio head. Well, unrecognizable until he opens his fat (you'll see) yap. It's a completely pointless cameo that adds nothing to the film, instead distracting and detracting. I don't know who okayed his appearance here, and maybe he thought it would rejuvenate his image a little, but I hope we never have to see Tom Cruise in a fat suit again.But. Leave that aside for a moment. The movie does rock out loud, as the kids used to say, and there's plenty of mayhem, and profanity, and yes, drug humor. I like movies that don't flinch, comedically, from envelope-pushing topics. Each actor plays his role to the hilt - including Matthew McConaughey as a laid-back agent - and, working in unison, they churn out a respectable, clever war comedy. Ignore the critics who say the movie is racist toward black people - it isn't - or that it's hateful toward the mentally challenged - it's not. It's easy to step over the line separating parody from mockery, and this movie dances on the line but never crosses it.",7,2,7,16 August 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A non-superhero-comic-book movie that is really good
","Scott Pilgrim has a fun storyline buttressed by great characterizations and invigorating special effects that don't seem at all gimmicky or tacked on. Styled almost exactly like the graphic novel on which it's based, it permits the viewer to suspend disbelief with some degree of plausible deniability; that is, we're not asked to believe the impossible or even highly improbable, like using two sports cars to rip the door off a safe.Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a bass player in a garage band. Scott's 22 and is now dating a 17-year-old high school student named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). That may seem unorthodox at first, but bear in mind that Michael Cera looks like he's 16 anyway, so it's not as stark a contrast as it may seem. Anyway, Knives thinks Scott's awesome, and he just sort of tolerates her. They haven't even kissed.But then one night at a party, Scott sees Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a purple-coiffed drifter with a blasé attitude that belies something... well, something dark and mysterious, if nothing else. And Scott does everything he can to find out more about Ramona, much to the chagrin of his bandmates, his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin), and his sister (Anna Kendrick).Okay, cutting to the chase. Turns out that although the worldly Ramona does sorta-kinda like Scott, she has issues. Like evil exes. And so the crux of the story comes about - Scott must defeat her seven evil exes. How? Well, with kung fu, karate, judo, other fighting styles, and various weapons. Why? Well, to win her heart, of course! Oh, did you want more details than that? Let's just say that Scott Pilgrim is essentially a video game based on a graphic novel. There are levels (each ex representing one level); beat the level/ex, you move on to the next one, and so on. Each ex has special powers; so do you, just like in a video game. And when you beat them, they don't lay there all bloody and whatnot; they turn into gold coins. Just like in real life! One of the truly entertaining aspects of the movie is how director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) integrates this video-game mentality into the plot line seamlessly. Characters don't act astounded that someone can shoot fire from their hands or fly through the air or cause demons to emerge from a DJ board. It's expected. And Scott Pilgrim himself isn't amazed that he can kick butt with his... well, with his feet. Which is how you kick things. So add in the video-game effects and then a splash of Batman (1966) sound effects, complete with the onomatopoeic words appearing above the action. Lovely visual touch.The movie is witty, too. It's not just a series of wacky adventures peppered with impossible effects. Pilgrim is no hero - he's cheating on two women! - but is just likable enough to be a real protagonist. He's more a victim of his own desires. He tries his best to be everything to everyone, which isn't a role that Michael Cera is unfamiliar with. I mean, he looks wimpy but engaging, sort of like a beagle. He gets to fight some excellent exes, too, like Chris Evans as a hubristic actor (complete with stunt doubles!) and Jason Schwartzman as the Machiavellian proto-jerk villain.Scott Pilgrim is a solidly different film. It's part action, part comedy, big part whimsy. It's daring and unconventional, and from a purely visual standpoint is really remarkably made. It's exciting and entertaining.",8,0,2,2 May 2011
Avengers: Endgame," Mind blowing
","It seems like there's always a big Movie Event nowadays, like the last Lord of the Rings movie, the last Harry Potter, or the first Stars Wars movie in forever. Each of these movies packs a huge emotional wallop as we see the culmination of story arcs we've been following for several years. With the Avengers, we've been following these arcs for ten years (and now 22 films), and Endgame had the unenviable task of following the cliffhanger of its immediate predecessor. How will the Avengers reverse the Decimation? Well, for starters they'll do so in a three-hour-plus movie - and they'll need every minute, too. But the road to redemption is not a straight one at all, and if you thought that the final scenes in other franchises were powerful...well, in Endgame they happen very frequently. How emotional is this movie? Bearing in mind that it's a comic book movie, not a Hallmark movie, one wouldn't expect only the broadest of 'heavy' scenes, and yet in Endgame these scenes seem to occur every few minutes. How emotional? It used to be that people would rate melodramas based on the number of handkerchiefs they needed to wipe their tears or blow their noses. For Endgame, I'd say it's a five hankie movie, but only if one reuses one's hankie a lot. I counted twelve tear-inducing scenes. 12! But the franchise has always depended, to some degree, on surprises, and luckily for me nothing was spoiled beforehand. In Endgame, we see many, many character arcs completed one way or another. The movie is exceedingly satisfying and emotional draining. It is far and away the finest comic book movie I've ever seen, and I hope it joins Black Panther in garnering itself an Oscar nomination or two next year. There isn't a single moment in this movie that misses a step, no single overwrought or drawn-out scene. There is just moment after moment of awesomeness. Even if you have just a vague idea of what the plot is or who the Avengers are, you probably won't watch this movie without feeling something magical. The characters are well written and exceptionally well played. The action is exhilarating. The ending is cathartic. It's very worthwhile to see this in a theater, too.",9,0,1,28 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," Solid followup to Casino Royale; grim closure
","Even without the gimmicky gadgetry, the misogyny, and the Moneypenny, Quantum of Solace is an able entry in the long-running James Bond series. Although it is quite violent, the action is basically nonstop for the entire length of the movie, and Daniel Craig holds his own (again) as the now-towheaded, gritty superspy. Quantum of Solace is breathless and exhilarating, moving its minimalist plot so quickly that at times it's hard to tell exactly what's happening.The action begins about one hour after the end of the last Bond film, Casino Royale, with a terrifying car-chase (and foot-chase) scene through an Italian town, as Bond is in hot pursuit of a man who may have some connection to the late Vesper Lynd of the previous film. Bond needs closure, you see; he needs to get over Vesper's death somehow, and to him that means finding out what she was all about. Through the course of his pursuits, he discovers that the trail leads to one Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a shifty entrepreneur who runs an eco-first company (Greene, get it?). But this being a Bond movie, Greene isn't the be-all, end-all villain, is he? Well, there's also a corrupt Latin American dictator-in-waiting; perhaps he'll do. Vying for Bond Girl status are Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who of course is with the evil Greene, and Agent Fields (Gemma Arterton), who's an agent with MI6 (but who's also barely seen in the movie anyway).The most striking difference between this and the other Bond films, save for Casino Royale, is how angry James Bond is. Craig does a slow burn very well; he's not bristling with contempt, but you can tell it's smouldering just beneath the surface. He's bent on revenge, a fact that M (Judi Dench) picks up on rather quickly, so the question is: Can Bond put aside his emotions to concentrate on finding something about the new super-secret organization, following in the footsteps of SMERSH and SPECTRE, that's behind everything? M doesn't trust Bond entirely, in part because in the two films since the reboot he's killed basically everyone who's gotten in his way, even people who might have been useful.But what makes this a Bond movie, exactly? There's Bond and M, and there's a Bond Girl with an intentionally wacky name (Strawberry Fields, according to the credits, and yes, she's a redhead). Craig's Bond is charming and ruthless (often simultaneously), and he's not prone to the sardonic one-liners that preceding Bonds were prone to spout. Now, one could argue that those lines were cheesy and dopey, but what they did was offset the action scenes. You don't get that in QoS, really; Craig's Bond is a man of few words. And he's single minded and unrelenting, striving to come to terms with Vesper's death before his grief can completely consume him.Even with the rage and grimness, though, this is still quite an acceptable movie. After 46 years of Bond films, the audience has a good idea of what to expect from the movies: explosions, girls, chases, and Bond. Quantum of Solace, filmed in six countries, maintains the exotic-locale quotient, too, another staple of the series. (It would be too much to have James Bond do all of his spying in one country, certainly.) Jeffrey Wright returns (briefly) as CIA agent Felix Leiter, a character who's been in several of the Bond films (and was actually fed to Blofeld's sharks, off-screen, in Licence to Kill), and Jesper Christensen returns as Mr. White, last seen running at the end of Casino Royale. But there's no Q, and no Moneypenny, although rumor has it that both will appear in the next Bond film.On the whole, Quantum of Solace is a satisfying popcorn movie. It's not overplotted - as had been the case with many others in the series - and the action is so frenetic that it is often tough to follow on its own merits, but because of the simplistic plot, one can put the pieces together easily anyway. One caveat: It seems that in many of those quick-paced hand-to-hand-combat scenes, Bond is dressed very similarly to his foe, thus making it difficult to tell who's winning. I'll never understand fight choreography. Oh, another question, too: If M is so darn smart, how come she sent an office clerk (Agent Fields!) to put Bond on a plane? Good Lord.",7,2,4,15 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Ew, he slimed me!
","Finally, the two sci-fi franchises meet, as was prophesied in Predator 2., when the head of an Alien was seen in the Predator's trophy room. This was in 1990. For fanboys, it's been a long 14 years.Having seen one other crossover movie (Freddy versus Jason!), I wasn't too stoked for this one. When you take two movies that have their own histories and mush them together into the same movie, there are going to be some inconsistencies.I'm not a fanboy of either series, so I can't speak to the movie's accuracy in that sense. All I know is that Alien = bad (i.e., attacks humans) and Predator = bad (i.e., attacks humans).The basic story here is that a group of scientists discovers an ancient pyramid in Antarctica, and when they explore it they find themselves in a battle between the Aliens and the Predators. Place your bets, kids! The over/under on bloodshed is forty gallons; the Predators are favored by 19 vats of slime.As with all disparate casts, the expedition is composed of scientists from varying backgrounds: a mechanical engineer, a couple of archaeologists, a mountain climber/guide, and do forth. Oh, and men with guns. Their mission is to get to the pyramid and see what's what. Leading them is Lex Woods (Sanaa Lathan); she's a tough, strong leader. You know right away she'll make it through this ordeal alive, because much of the pre-expedition focus is on her. You know, to endear her to the audience. Other characters are given short shrift by comparison.Neat little trivium: Lance Henriksen, who was in a couple of the Alien movies, here plays industrial billionaire Charles Weyland, whose company found the pyramid and is financing the expedition. Lance looks pretty haggard. I mean, he always did, but now he looks like Clint Eastwood before Clint got his Botox injections. But I digress.Anyway, long story short - they get there, find Aliens have attacked the previous expedition (from 1904!), and then all hell breaks loose as everyone has to fight to survive.There are plenty of good things to say about this movie. For one thing, the set design and special effects are fantastic, making the viewer forget the pedestrian plot and the shallow characters. Come to think of it, though, the characters really aren't all that shallow, compared with other recent sci-fis. Take Supernova or Event Horizon. No, seriously, take them. Same idea - heterogeneous crew, Something Evil afoot - and yet the effects weren't good enough to distract us from the crappy dialogue. In AvP, there aren't many memorable lines (if any), but it didn't matter.And here's why. By now, we all know what the Predator looks like (seen near the end of P2). And we've always known what the Alien's looked like. So there was no sense in keeping either hidden from view. This is Alien versus Predator, so let's see 'em fight! And fight they did, with our feckless humans stuck in the middle. This time, since we've seen some of what either species can do, some human characteristics are attributed to them, particularly the Predators, (yes, Predators plural), such as War paint, honor, and rituals.AvP is a very diverting, action-packed movie - there aren't any slow moments, and it follows through on its own premise.",7,1,2,2 February 2005
No Country for Old Men," Charming, gripping, no movie for narcoleptics
","Mysterious and elusive, provocative and disturbing, No Country for Old Men is the finest Coen Brothers film to date. It's got the profane violence of Blood Simple, the wry wit of Raising Arizona, and the tight plotting of Fargo - not to mention outstanding performances by Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones. And it culminates in a big finish that'll either leave you wanting more or simply cold.The plot is fairly straightforward. A hunter named Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the scene of a drug deal gone really, really sour. Dead bodies, including a dog. Shot up trucks. A huge stash of drugs. And, at the end of a bloody trail, a dead man and a satchel with $2 million in cash. Now, what would you do in that situation? You're armed, but who knows who's out there in the wilderness, looking for their lost loot? If you're Mr. Moss, you amscray the heck out of there.Of course, someone's gonna come looking for that money, and that person is a crazy bastard named Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who has a penchant for killing and absolutely no moral compass to speak of. He wants something, he kills you and takes it. Or takes it and kills you. Either way. Chigurh is single minded, but he's by no means a simple man; he's whip smart and blindingly fast with his gun and his feet. There's something about Chigurh that separates him from every other killer who wants his money back; its intangible, and it's all because Bardem is so perfect in the role. His sad eyes belie an absolutely terrifying, methodically maniacal criminal.Completing the trifecta is a beleaguered, world-weary sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is to No Country for Old Men as Marge Gunderson was to Fargo; the no-nonsense, superclever, seasoned Johnny Law who tries desperately to piece together the puzzle before every character has been murdered, a la Shakespeare. This is a role Jones was made to play, and I can safely say he turns in the finest, most nuanced and sincere performance of his long career. Jones has the countenance of a leathery cowpoke as it is, and the unique drawl to accompany it, and the beautiful, poignant script (also by the Coen brothers) allows him to really show his stuff.Make no mistake, though, in spite of its subtleties, this is a very violent movie; many painful, gut-wrenching deaths occur. Still and all, one thing that makes the movie work is that the violence seems real, not comic-book style; it's not violence without serious repercussions.Back to the writing. At times during the film, multiple story lines are in motion, a la Pulp Fiction, and everything moves so seamlessly that it's only later, in retrospect, that you recall certain aspects that tie in one character's perspective with that of another. A mediocre screenwriter would have trouble with this, and plot holes the size of the Rio Grande itself would emerge. People would laugh about the plot inaccuracies and overall inadequacies.And then, finally, there's that ending. Some people will absolutely love the ending, but others will stare at the screen for a few minutes, wondering if there's more to the story. Simply put, not everything is explicitly resolved, so if you're the kind of person who must have everything tied up as if in a 30-minute sitcom, you're going to have an issue or two with the finale. There was a bit of silence in the theater in which I saw this movie, but I didn't get the impression it was the angry 'THAT'S IT??' kind, just the surprised kind.",9,2,9,21 December 2007
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A mixed bag
","The second Hobbit movie is sort of the Back to the Future II of its series: at times thrilling, at times confusing, and ultimately a little unsatisfying. It boasts terrific effects and choreography but perhaps a little too much plot, too many new characters, and a lengthy running time.The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug picks up more or less where the first film left off; the dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins, and Gandalf have left the Misty Mountains and continue their quest to the Lonely Mountain, former dominion of the Dwarf race, aiming to recapture it and the treasure below it from the demonic dragon Smaug. (Interestingly, Smaug himself doesn't even make an appearance on screen until the final half hour of the film.) The outfit is led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), descendant of the last King beneath the Mountain, before Smaug took over; the other dwarfs are more-or-less interchangeable, much like those who accompanied Snow White in her adventures. Their names are, I think, Palin, Marty Balin, Gerald McBoingBoing, Doink, Coin, and Gilligan. I'm not sure.Now, the movie's title implies that Smaug (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) is desolate - he sort of is, living beneath the Lonely Mountain and all - but since this is more about the journey than the destination, we are treated to concurrent plots and unexpected encounters. The troupe loses Gandalf when the latter rushes off to deliver one of his legendary Important Messages, so he's absent for much of the film, and within some time the gang finds itself within the forests of Mirkwood, which is inhabited by Elves who aren't really like the stern-but-nice ones at Rivendell. (You know, from the last film.) And these Elves are a heck of a lot more suspicious of, well, everything. They're led by Thranduil (Lee Pace), who wishes to keep his realm closed off from the problems of the outside world, much like Elrond would for Rivendell in the later LOTR films. Thranduil's son is Legolas (Orlando Bloom), whom we're well acquainted with; he's smitten with the chief of the wood-elf guards, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) - but, like Shakespeare's star-cross'd lovers, Papa would never let the sylvan elf be with his offspring. You know how it is.But lest you think this is all about the Elves and Dwarfs and how they dislike/despise each other, there's another fun thread to follow: it looks like a certain Evil is gathering strength, both in body and in numbers, although remaining hidden from view. Thus the Orcs are both tracking Thorin and his merry men and helping their Master - you know who I mean - to become more corporeal. And then, to riff on an old 1970s TV show, there's Smaug. So there's truly no shortage of Bad Guys, and nor is there a shortage of ominous foreshadowing.The movie never drags, and it makes good (judicious) use of 3D, but it suffers from a real lack of personality. Bilbo and Gandalf, who have the most charisma and charm of the bunch, are given less to do here than in the first film; the Dwarvish leader Thorin, by contrast, isn't a sufficiently interesting character to hold extended attention. In addition, you have all of these Dwarfs whose names aren't entirely memorable, so when one is left behind all one can do is shrug and wonder who else is left. Which brings us to the the truly positive aspects of the movie. The fight and action scenes are supremely entertaining to watch, with Elf versus Orc, Elf versus Dwarf, Dwarf versus Orc, Dwarf versus Human, Wizard versus Orc, Wizard versus Something Evil, and Dragon versus Hobbit and Dwarfs. The intensity of each of these scenes is almost poetic, with Lilly and Bloom miles beyond everyone else in their seemingly effortless Orc-slaying abilities. Lilly in particular is remarkable, both beautiful, humanistic, and cunning beyond her years; her Tauriel (oddly enough, not really a Tolkien character) is savvy, level headed, and soft hearted. The final scene, more than two and a half hours into the film, is a bit of a letdown, a mere gateway to the final part of the trilogy. It's true that the first Hobbit film took the same tack, but this time out the denouement feels abrupt; we left not just wanting more but simply hanging.",7,1,5,15 December 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Gorgeous, rich true-life portrayals
","Although as long as its title is unwieldy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is (apparently) true to life and is the beneficiary of a smart, uncharacteristically supporting performance by Brad Pitt as the folk-hero villain and a strong, if a bit mannered, performance by Casey Affleck as his eventual killer.It's the latter days of the James Gang, and weary older brother Frank (Sam Shepard) is calling it quits after one last train robbery. Jesse's not so inclined, though, so he assembles a new crew of cutthroats, including the Ford brothers, Charley (Sam Rockwell) and Bob (Affleck). But all the while, Jesse is always looking over his shoulder, sure that someone's about to cut him down, perhaps even someone from his own gang. It doesn't help that he's written terroristic telegrams to governors and presidents alike, either.The story's told through the eyes of Bob Ford, a stammering young man who strongly idolizes Jesse to the point of carrying around a shoebox of dime novels about the legendary outlaw and knowing all sorts of arcane facts about Jesse. Not surprisingly, to Jesse and the rest of the gang (including Bob's brother Charley), this seems childish and downright pathetic, and consequently they don't give the young Ford much respect.This attitude leads to a strange mixture of resentment and continued idolatry on the part of Robert Ford. Should he continue to try to ingratiate himself with Jesse, or should he turn him in to the authorities? Turning him in might make him a hero - the one man who could fell Jesse James - but then he'd really lose whatever remaining respect Jessie had for Bob. (To Bob's thinking, he's one of Jesse's pals.) Affleck's Oscar-nominated performance is wonderful, walking the fine line between hammy and nuanced. A less-capable actor (or, perhaps, an actor less on top of his game) might have taken Bob's idiosyncrasies and run with them, played them up rather than muting them somewhat, making them feel more natural. You get the sense that although Bob is not a good man by any means, he is human in his actions and reactions; he can be a cold-blooded murderer and thief, but how he deals with each minicrisis is neither insincere nor cartoonish. It might be a testament to Affleck that he's able to make something out of the relatively dull character of Robert Ford.Brad Pitt is simply Brad Pitt. He's come a long way since movies like Legends of the Fall and A River Runs through It; he's now a Good Actor, not just a beefcake model, and he's effectively menacing and confusing as James, who was (the movie says) going a bit off the deep end in his waning years even without having to deal with the specter of betrayal. James is sad, excitable, angry, dissonant, and Pitt is up to the task. Weirdly enough, though, although Jesse James is the nominal subject of the movie, Pitt takes a backseat to Affleck. This isn't about romanticizing the lawless West and the tough fiends who populated it; it's about dreams crushed and comeuppance delivered.At more than two and a half hours, this is not a broad, unsubtle look at real-life events, and it's not always easy to watch. James is not only not presented positively, he's shown as a realistically diabolical criminal, not just some pretty boy with a lot of 'cute' facial hair. Multilayered characterizations and sweeping, Oscar-nominated cinematography make this an effective Western.",7,0,1,14 February 2008
Toy Story 4," Freedom for the toys!
","I enjoyed Toy Story 4, which is sort of like saying I like to breathe. It's nigh impossible to dislike Pixar's flagship series after 24 (!) years of laughs and heartstring-pulling. Now, along with most people I figured that Toy Story 3 was the end of it all, as Andy goes off to college and the toys wind up with another kid, named Bonnie. But oh, no! There are more feelings to be felt. Bonnie, then a toddler, is now entering kindergarten and is very anxious. Woody sneaks off to her orientation and watches sadly as Bonnie interacts with no kids and appears to feel excluded. Left to her own friend-making devices, she constructs a new friend all of her own, a spork with googly eyes, pipe-cleaner hands, and popsicle-stick feet named, uh, Forky. And by putting her name on his feet, Bonnie gives Forky life. So now we have an all-new toy, one who has never been a toy before (he insists he's trash, as his components were fished from a trash can). Woody sees how much Bonnie needs her new toy, as sort of a security blanket for the stress of kindergarten, and he's determined to make Forky understand his lot in life and his importance to Bonnie. Along the way, Woody has a chance encounter with a figure from his own past - Little Bo Peep, who appeared in early Toy Story films but who has been gone for some time. Bo has it going on, living the life of a 'free toy,' i.e., one not belonging to any kid - even though that's (apparently) what most toys want. Woody's been someone's toy forever - is this something he wants as well? This movie presents a bit of a crossroads for Woody (less so for the other toys), and as with special messages in the previous films, it is wonderfully handled and expertly expressed. First, let me look at the good stuff, of which there's plenty, from this movie. The voice actors are, as usual, pitch perfect - and it's nice to hear Annie Potts back as Bo Peep. Key and Peele are along for the laughs, and Christina Hendricks, Tony Hale, Keanu Reeves, and Ally Maki are each wonderful additions; everyone feels like a natural fit, not shoe horned into a role. Then there are the inevitable action scenes, some of which are copied from previous TS films and others that are brand spanking new. Very well done; if this were a live-action movie, I'd be praising the choreography. Also, despite the contemplative, life-affirming lessons presented by the plot, the story never stagnates, and the toys learn on the fly (as opposed to learning after deep inner reflection, I guess). Now, the only slight downside for me was that this, again the fourth effort in the series, doesn't quite match up with the others for pure sentimental grandeur. It's not that the plot is trite; kids should love it for the same reasons they loved the other movies. It's just that it feels as if we've been led to the emotional precipice more than once in the toys' journey, and the journey (even with its inevitable strong payoff) doesn't pack the same punch as the first one. And that's about the extent of it. For me, the best movies have several scenes where I hear a sentence like the following in my head: 'This is why I love movies.' There was one such scene in Toy Story 4, which is one more than most movies but fewer than the first t three in this series.",8,0,4,7 August 2019
Batman Begins," Iffy first half, strong second.
","Despite a world of hype and great word of mouth, Batman Begins kind of fizzles, beginning tediously and nearly saving itself with an excellent second half. It's good, not great, Caped Crusader pulp fiction; better than Batman and Robin and Batman Returns, but not quite as good as the second original Batman.A well-known comic book character has an albatross around its neck: its own history. Since we know a lot about Batman, the movie about his genesis has to really convince us it's the same guy - it has to be sincere. Well, Batman Begins is awfully earnest - perhaps much too earnest - and the origins of certain of his trademarks are well explained, but the movie suffers from a noncharismatic lead and a tone that seems more suited to a generic James Bond movie.Let's star with Bats himself, Christian Bale. Bale is perhaps best known as the serial killer in American Psycho, and while playing a psychotic might well prepare one for being Batman, he simply doesn't provide enough oomph to the role. Remember, the role demands that the actor be hidden in a lycra suit for a good deal of the movie, so he has to be expressive with his face, commanding with his voice; a strong presence, in other words. Bale doesn't quite accomplish any of this - he comes off as more of a poor man's Tom Cruise, with limited facial expressions and emotions. Plus - and I don't mean to be unkind here - Bale has a gigantic light bulb for a head. Bruce Wayne's supposed to be somewhat suave; I kept looking for the dangly chain to make him light up.Moving on, we see the highly publicized Katie Holmes as the requisite love interest, Rachel Dawes. Holmes is amusingly miscast, far too much of a lightweight for the role. Her character is supposed to be in her twenties, but poor Katie acts and looks like she's still in high school. As with Bale, I looked in vain for something - a class ring, in Holmes' case. At any rate, she's about as convincing as Chris Farley as the Pope. There's not much chemistry between her and Bale in the few scenes they share, and she seems like she's only four lessons into a ten-lesson course of Acting with an A.Luckily, the supporting gang is quite good; this is what happens when you hire talented veteran talent. The elegant Michael Caine is onboard as Alfred, Bruce's butler and muse. Caine was born for the veddy proper role, and one can easily see the latter-day Alfred (Michael Gough in the other films) in Caine's portrayal. Morgan Freeman is Lucius Fox, the scientist who gets Bruce his Cool Gadgets, and Rutger Hauer is the nominal boss of Wayne Enterprises, megalomaniacally trying to take over the company, or something. Hauer's sort of wasted - any Eurotrash would have done as well in the role. But most of the other major supporting characters are the underwire to the bra of the plot. That's a good thing, for all you virgin males out there.Director Christopher Nolan is the guy who gave us Memento and Insomnia, but the trouble here is that there's nothing Christopher Nolan-like about the movie. Tim Burton's Batman had Tim Burton written all over it, and that's one thing that made it as successful as it was. But normally, with movies in a series (for example, the Bond films) it's not necessary to get a Big Name director to do the deed; you just need someone who will be true to the oeuvre; the Bat universe, in this case. So although it's nifty that they got the hot Nolan to direct, I don't think it was necessary.Batman Begins isn't badly written at all, but the first half does seem awfully slow. Get to the good stuff, you may whine. Let's lay off this James Bond crap and get to the avenging-death-of-parents bit. It's good that we learn why Bruce chose the Batman name, how he came upon his cape and gadgets, where the Batmobile came from, and when the Bat Signal was first used... but we need to see all that mystical be-the-one mumbo jumbo? I felt like I'd stumbled upon an old Mountain Dew commercial.",6,0,4,23 June 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," The princess is in this castle
","When the villain of a popular arcade game decides he's had enough of being the bad guy, he sets out to win over the other denizens of his game, with hilarious consequences. Wreck-It Ralph is a wonderful little film that combines smart dialog, brilliant animation varieties, and an abundance of familiar video-game characters - even to those who don't play games on a regular basis.Ralph (voice by the underrated John C. Reilly) has one job - wreck an apartment building. When a kid puts a quarter into the machine's slot. Ralph shouts his catch phrase and then climbs the building (he's quite large), destroying windows, bricks, the whole nine yards, until the hero of the game, Fix-It Felix (voice of Jack McBrayer) arrives to save the day (with the help of the human player). The game is sort of a combination of Donkey Kong (helpful handyman) and Rampage, a game in which huge monsters scaled skyscrapers just to destroy them.Anyway, Ralph has a quandary. While the rest of game's characters live in the fancy building within the game, he lives in a literal pile of bricks and dreams of something more. And when he notices that Felix is throwing a party celebrating the game's 30th anniversary without inviting Ralph...well, Ralph doesn't much appreciate that and vows to win a medal, any medal, in order to convince the building's occupants that he's not as bad as everyone thinks.This leads Ralph to jump into other games, a tactic that's forbidden. He winds up in a first-person shooter game much like Call of Duty, sneaking in as a foot soldier, and manages to grab a medal. Long story short (ha), this sort of screws up that game for the human player, and the main character of said war game has to track Ralph down among the other games in the arcade, because she realizes something else has left the game with Ralph.Ralph winds up in a game that's a mixture of Mario Kart and Candyland. Actually sounds like fun, doesn't it? He meets Vanellope (voice of Sarah Silverman), who's a glitch, an error in the game's code that would be more trouble to remove than leave in, so in she stays. Vannelope manages to get Ralph's precious medal but promises to give it back if he'll help her build a racecar so she can win the game's race. Well, the race within the game. Still with me? Vannelope is an outcast as a glitch, so she has quite a bit to prove. Ralph, of course, will help her, even though she's a smart-aleck little brat. Is there more to all of this than meets the eye? Sure! Will it go over most kids' heads? No! Is it still enjoyable for physically grown-up people? Heck yes! Sure, this is a Disney film, so Lessons will be Learned, but there's so much eye-candy - uh, literally - that the message is not heavy handed in the least. And what is that message? Nonspoiler alert - it might be that Ralph does have what it takes to be a Good Guy after all. I loved how there were so many different characters from different game systems (Nintendo, XBox, arcade-only, Sega, you name it); the Bad Guy support group includes one of the ghosts from Pac-Man, Bowser from the Mario games, M. Bison from Street Fighter, one of the guys from Mortal Kombat, and so on. Each is drawn in his own original style. Same for the various good guys who make cameos in the movie, like Sonic the Hedgehog, and Pac-Man himself. The blending of art styles is impeccable and spectacular. I'm also a fan of quick wit, and Silverman can quick-wit with the best of them, particularly when matched against a slow-witted character like Ralph. Oh, and did I mention the Candy King? Yeah, he runs things in that candy racecar game, and he's voiced by Alan Tudyk (Firefly) with an accent right out of old Hanna-Barbera films. Priceless.Is Wreck-It Ralph a great film? Not exactly, but it's hard to find a comparable movie. Other Disney movies have their own style, as do the Disney/Pixar films. This one is a stand-alone treat, exhilarating for kids of all ages, especially those who grew up playing that old 8-bit NES. Or those of us who were stuck with the Atari 2600. Or those who spent hours and hours in actual arcades, fighting space invaders and helping a dumb frog cross a freeway. And even if you've never once picked up a game controller, you'll appreciate the humor, the voice delivery, the story, and the message.",8,1,1,5 May 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Fits perfectly within the LOTR universe
","A shortish book is drawn out to not one but three full-length feature films, the better to flesh out characters who need, uh, fleshing, and the better to tell every bit of the tale. This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, who makes his first appearance as a young lad in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.If I could use just one word to describe the film, it would be 'wow.' Or maybe 'gosh' or 'gee' or 'holy COW'...but those are two words, and I am digressing. The movie is in 3D and will also be available in IMAX. I saw it in 3D. It's worth it in 3D. It's a beautiful, stunning film that feels right in line with the earlier Lord of the Rings movies, even though it's set 60 years earlier and derives from what's best described as a children's book.Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is a hobbit. Hobbits are smaller than you and me. Well, you, anyway. They're short. They live simple lives, and they love it. Theirs is an agrarian society. No magic, no oddities, and above all no adventures. And such is the case with Mr. Baggins, who lives in a home called Bag's End in an area known as The Shire. He is content. Until the mysterious wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) appears suddenly, as is his wont, and offers Bilbo a chance at a grand adventure indeed. It involves several dwarfs who wish to trek back to their homeland, which has been usurped by a huge dragon named Smaug, and reclaim it as their own. I know, it sounds simple and that Bilbo might be slumming by tagging along, but off he goes anyway. Reluctantly.Now, please bear in mind that, like the LOTR movies, this is just the first of three films. The entire Hobbit story isn't told. That means we spend more time in certain areas than we might have if the book had been filmed in one shot. The unsightly squad, with their faux burglar (Bilbo) run into comical stone giants and put on a rotating spit, then beset by orcs and goblins, and then at some point, deep within the goblins' mountain, Bilbo runs into a familiar (to us) face: Gollum, nee' Smeagol, the keeper of the One Ring. Much of the movie, with New Zealand stepping in admirably again for Middle-Earth, involves the troupe running from things. Running across fields, down into caves, through caverns, across more fields, up and down mountains, and so on. Lots of running. Considering most of these dwarfs are built like beer kegs and not Kenyan runners, I'm kind of surprised none of them suffer a cardiac arrest or two. But again, digression.And much of the plot, aside from the standard journey to a faraway land, involves the development of Bilbo as, well, a man. Hobbit, whatever. He's meek and mild, but he finds his courage, several times over, through the course of just this film. The gleaming sword given to him by Gandalf helps a mite, too. But still! Cunning and courage and whatnot from a lowly hobbit! (Literally lowly.)You will see some familiar faces. Let's just say that Rivendell is on the way, just as it was/will be in the first LOTR movie. There takes place a debate about whether the dwarfs, led by the great Thorin Oakenshield, really should be doing what they're doing. Saruman the White is pretty set against it, but Lady Galadriel seems to trust Gandalf more than anyone. And so our dwarfs run from place to place, lopping off orc heads as they go. It's pretty neat.Is this a movie for kids, though? It's based on a kids-like book that's much lighter than the LOTR stuff to follow. And it is PG-13, of course. But it's not a family film in the sense that, oh, The Polar Express is. It can be scary at times, and the 3D - well used - heightens that. The dwarfs are great comic relief, but they don't dull the edge of a quick- paced, very well shot film. The youngest shouldn't be in the theater, but it's suitable for the tweens and above. With plenty of great action for the rest of us, too.",9,221,419,11 December 2012
Man on the Moon," Maybe they can put a man on the moon, but they can't make a good Andy Kaufman film
","This uninspired biopic of the infamous oddball performance artist/comedian Andy Kaufman misfires on almost all counts. To begin with, there are millions of people who have never heard of Andy Kaufman, so there's a entire demographic that would need to be taught about the late auteur. Right away, when you have to convince a large portion of the population that the subject of your movie is worthy of your cinematic paintbrush, you're in a hole that most moviemakers can't dig out of. But that's only the people who weren't aware of Andy Kaufman when he was alive. What about those of us who were? Those who closely followed the television series Taxi remember the character of Latka Gravas, but how many people paid any attention to Kaufman's offscreen antics? Those who did notice generally seem to fall into one of two categories: those who loved Kaufman and believed him to be an unsung comic genius, and those who despised him and saw him as a relentlessly weird pathological  liar.
Those who loved Kaufman and his work might find something of value in this film. As a straight biography, there are inspired, original moments - such as the beginning acting as an end, or some of Kaufman's bits (including the legendary Saturday Night Live 'Mighty Mouse' skit) - but most of the movie is rather pedestrian, given that it's directed by Milos Forman, who brought One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to the big screen. Our Hero struggles against People Who Don't Understand Him (parents, audiences) until he is saved by a Nice Agent With a Heart of Gold who shows him the way to superstardom. Ho-hum. The viewer, instead of being enticed by this purportedly unique, larger-than-life character, finds that it's really just an exercise in somnolence. The script is smarmy and self-satisfied, as if it's telling it's damn funny and if you want to be hip, you'll think it's funny, too.Jim Carrey, as Andy, turns in some remarkable work, but thanks to a rather standard script doesn't really get to show off his acting chops (which we saw in The Truman Show). As Andy, Carrey turns in a good impersonation, but not a full characterization. Courtney Love as Andy's girlfriend Lynne isn't exceptional, but the character lacks depth. She's no more or less important than Adrian from Rocky, cheering her man on through thick and thin, leaving him at one point but - surprise - coming back to him when he needs her the most. Danny DeVito is his agent, George, and he's likeable in a thankless role (remember Edward Norton in The People Versus Larry Flynt?).
Like Oliver Stone's The Doors, we come away from this movie not knowing much more about the lead character than we did before the movie. There are no deep insights, no real secrets revealed. The result is a slipshod, lackadaisical film, a movie that promises to bring the story of a 'misunderstood' man to light but winds up being a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",2,6,13,31 May 2000
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Flyin' high
","How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a decent follow up, for an animated sequel, and kids and other fans of the original should be happy with it. In it, our former Viking nebbish Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is now the hero of the town of Berk, which is still ruled by his dad, Stoick (Gerard Butler). Peace reigns in Berk; instead of endless fighting and pillaging on the part of the marauding Vikes, dragons and men are friends of a sort. Even the most hardened of savages favors the flying reptiles.Hiccup knows that his dad wants very badly to be the next chief of their Viking tribe, but he himself doesn't want to follow in those large footsteps. While scouting with his own dragon, Toothless, Hiccup discovers an island that's part land, part ice - in that there are huge shards of ice skewering the island and the domiciles. Then he - and his gal pal Astrid (America Ferrera) and her dragon - are trapped, partly so that Hiccup can find out more about this new place. And it quickly comes out that the band of men on the island have been attacked several times by dragons and that they themselves are, in fact, dragon trappers. They're catching dragons to serve in a dragon army ruled by Drago (Djimon Hounsou), who's naturally out to rule the world.The Dreamworks animation is fine - as good as in the previous movie, anyway - but more importantly the voice characterizations are great. In one fun scene, Astrid pokes fun at Hiccup's speech mannerisms, which of course mimic those of the real-life Jay Baruchel: a lot of shrugging and hand-waving. Jack Black, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, and Kristen Wiig voice Hiccup's friends, and Kit Harrington (Jon Snow on Game of Thrones, who knows nothing) plays a duplicitous dragon trapper. Oh yeah, and Cate Blanchett's there as well.The movie and its predecessor are based on a series of books by Cressida Crowell, and there are plans to make a third film. No surprise there - the sequel did great box office and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. And while the effects and action make for a wholly entertaining movie, there's some beautiful, quieter moments, between parent and son, girl and boy, boy and dragon. A fine offset to the comic-book mayhem surrounding it.",8,1,2,16 March 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," This is the one where Ed Norton pops his head up out of a door in the floor
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is appropriately quirky, farcical drama featuring near-flawless casting and superior direction and cinematography. The year may be young, but Wes Anderson's film is one of my favorites so far. A young writer (Jude Law), staying at the titular hotel, chances to encounter the establishment's elderly owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), who relates the tale of how he came to own the place 'between the wars' in the mythical eastern European country of Zubrowka. Zero began his career as a lobby boy in the hotel, under the mentorship of the hotel's legendary concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave knows his eccentric, rich guests very well, particularly the elderly female ones. One such guest is Madame D (Tilda Swinton), with whom Gustave has an occasional fling. She is due to leave the hotel and return home, but she's anxious, feeling that someone is conspiring around her. She fears she won't see Gustave again.Well, it's not long before Madame D turns up dead, and Gustave (with Zero) rushes to her wake, only to find himself at the reading of the will. It will surprise few people that the only item of value in Madame D's large estate has been bequeathed to Gustave - a painting called Boy with Apple. But the inheritance is quickly challenged by the deceased's son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), who's a plain mean and profane jerk. And then, as the trailer indicates, Gustave and the loyal Zero abscond with the painting anyway and hide it; Gustave is arrested and jailed. The movie is brimming with spot-on performances. Bill Murray, Fisher Stevens, and Bob Balaban have small roles as fellow concierges. Jason Schwartzmann is a present-day lobby boy. Owen Wilson is Gustave's immediate replacement as concierge. Harvey Keitel is a tough inmate. Willem Dafoe is a ruthless hit-man in Dmitri's employ. Most have worked in Wes Anderson films before, and all work very well together.I've seen a few Wes Anderson movies, and I think this one most closely resembles Moonrise Kingdom in terms of its whimsical tone. In fact, it may even bear some relation to the Coen Brothers masterpieces O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Raising Arizona - black comedies whose success depends so much on their actors' ability to really sell deadpan humor in an otherwise-serious context. Fiennes, who's not known for his comedies, is superb as the gentlemanly Gustave, and he drives the movie with equal parts British reservedness and explosive irritation - but always with the utmost in manners. The movie is also beautifully shot, but frequent Anderson collaborator Robert D. Yeoman. From the stylish structure of the hotel to the stark desolation of the Alps, the film has a delightfully distinct look to it, par for the course for Anderson films.",9,0,7,8 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Terrific in IMAX - really great stunts
","You never really expect the fourth movie in a series to be very good. The law of diminishing returns usually applies here. You know the characters, you know the premise, you know there will be a plethora of explosions and perhaps some bon mots. And that's all you want out of escapist, popcorn movies. The new Mission:Impossible movie flouts those conventions, though. Sure, its plot is straightforward (only one man can stop the end of the world!), but the stunts and the spectacular cinematography complement the story, rather than point to its threadbare nature.In Mission:Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is imprisoned in Serbia. We don't know why, but maybe we'll find out later. Unsurprisingly, he's busted out by fellow agents Benji (Simon Pegg) and Carter (Paula Patton). It seems some bad guy has his hands on a nuclear device and needs only the launch codes, but when Hunt and his team infiltrate the Kremlin to retrieve them... well, the place blows up. The Impossible Missions Force is blamed and disbanded, as the U.S. president (fearing repercussions from Moscow) invokes Ghost Protocol, and the team is left on its own to Save the World.The events take place sometime after those in M:I 3, in which Ethan Hunt quits the IMF. Well, here we are again, so perhaps that was just a decoy, huh? But it's not a simple matter of trying to make the audience forget Hunt had quit; that plot idiosyncrasy is explained. Luckily for us, it's not a driving force behind the plot, which is just a long-hand way of saying that although this one follows that one and refers to events in that one, it doesn't negate that one at all - it plays off it. Trust me, it'll make more sense once you see the movie.The must-find-bad-guys-to-save-self/save-the-world plot is not really new, but the way it dovetails with the subplots (i.e., what happened to Hunt after M:I III and other pieces) is surprisingly well done. Added to the mix is an analyst, played by Jeremy Renner, who finds himself sucked into Hunt's mission and who may not be who he says he is. It's a movie in which we're not left guessing about the big things (e.g., who's the bad guy, what's he up to) but rather about the small things (what does X have to do with Y, what does Y know that we don't).I saw this movie in an IMAX theater, and for once the effect is well used. Here's a prime example. Ethan Hunt needs to get to a computer server room within the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Trouble is, he can't access it from the inside. In case you're not familiar, the Burj Khalifa is 2,716.5 feet tall. That's more than half a mile. Ethan needs to scale it (although, luckily, not the entire height). He uses these suction gloves: thwop, thwop, thwop. And while he's doing this, we're treated to a dizzying look at the skyscrapers below him; because of the huge screen, it really felt as if the theater were tilting, rather than the camera. Excellent work. Every explosion, every pounding is amplified; when glass shatters, you duck - and the movie's not even in 3D. Cruise is Tom Cruise. He is not, as I am fond of saying, an actor - he is a movie star. Ethan Hunt is a hugely successful character for him, but he's not without some flaws. In fact, I think it can be said that there's more to Hunt in this installment than there was before, and somehow Cruise is able to make us feel, well, concern for him. Sure, he's in charge, but he has his demons. Cruise doesn't overact here. In fact, he even slows the tempo down a bit, as if he's realized that sometimes saying nothing is better than saying something. Sure, he grits his teeth and defies all laws of physics, but he does seem to be bringing a little more to Hunt's character, psychologically, than we'd seen before. Big plus.Mission:Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a near-perfect action/spy thriller. There is plenty of intrigue, and you shouldn't be able to guess it all at first blush. It is a plausible, if not remarkable, plot. Its stuntwork - some performed by Cruise - is staggering to behold. If there ever was a movie that made your jaw drop at times, it's this one. They even manage to mix in a huge sandstorm, which is in itself a little scary. (Side note: how do real Dubai people deal with these things? In the movie they appear to be driving off the road as if they'd never seen one before.) Tom Cruise updates his usual Action Man character with some mental issues, and it works. He has an able supporting cast - great comic relief from Pegg, as usual, and the delectable Patton as a woman with issues of her own - and boggling special effects to move things along. This is definitely a movie best appreciated on the big screen.",8,7,11,16 January 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A hot mess
","Although the CGI is acceptable and the apes have personality, this reboot lacks charisma, plausibility, and creativity. It combines elements of every medical drama you've ever seen with every animals-in- peril movie you've ever seen. The result is a dishonest, amorphous pile.The movie is actually a prequel to the Apes movies we all know and love (or not). How did the apes come to rule the planet? Well, here's the thing. You might not get an answer to that from this film at all. I'm sure the creative minds behind it thought that Rise would eventually lead to several more Apes movies, with maybe the next one bridging this one and the Planet of the Apes movie with which we're all familiar. But if one takes this movie at face value, it's a standard-issue, clichéd film and nothing more, no matter what it aspires to lead into. James Franco plays a scientist searching for a cure for Alzheimer's, with which his dad (John Lithgow) is afflicted. He thinks he's got the right medicine when one - yes, one - chimp shows remarkable cognitive abilities after receiving the drug. This is more than enough for Franco's Will Rodman to show off the primate to investors so that they can provide more money for Phase II, which naturally is when the ape goes, well, ape and destroys the lab.(Yes, I'm using ape, chimp, primate, and so on interchangeably. It's more fun than writing 'chimp,' even when it's completely inaccurate.)I'll say this much for sure - the chimps have great personality, more than any of the humans. Andy Serkis plays the central character, Caesar, and by play I mean move about so that the CGI will match up, which is sort of like acting only not. Caesar, who quickly becomes too smart for his own good (he's the son of the chimp who destroyed the lab), engineers an escape from the two-legged meanies who are holding him, with the help of a giant ape, an orangutan, and other assorted nonhumans.It's almost a Disney movie. In fact, it's similar to that overlooked Matthew Broderick movie, Project X, in which Broderick tries to save chimps who are undergoing some testing of their own. But beyond the facts that there are apes involved and that we've been informed this is a quasi prequel, the movie has very little in common with the actual Planet of the Apes movies. Because of that, it feels much more like a standard action/drama. With chimps. The whole thing feels like a setup. Most of the movie deals with Caesar growing up as a ward/son to Rodman, who of course meets cute with a zoo vet (Freida Pinto) and bonds with everyone. The 'rise' part of the movie doesn't occur until far into the movie. Luckily, the charm of the fascinating nonhuman characters maintains the interest level a little bit. But only just.If you make it to the end (no spoiler here), you might be disappointed. The 'rise' feels almost tacked on, as if someone suddenly remembered that the primates were supposed to be rebelling against The Man, or something. We never wind up any closer to knowing how the world became the planet of the apes than we were when the movie began, and for that reason it felt like a big waste of time and talent.",5,2,4,29 June 2012
City of God," A real shot to the heart
","City of God (2002, ***1/2) is a brutal look at the drug wars fought in Rio de Janeiro's slums over a period of several decades. It's not always an easy film to watch, but it's utterly gripping and (improbably) humorous at turns.The movie centers on a boy/young man named Rocket (Buscapé in Portuguese, the spoken language in this movie) in the titular slum, the wrong side of the tracks in Rio. Rocket's older brother is in a gang called the Tender Three; this trio commits armed robbery but gives at least some of the proceeds to their impoverished brothers and sisters. The gang's not for long in this story, as one of their sidekick Little Rascals, Li'l Dice (Douglas Silva) has higher aspirations; soon he – under a new moniker, Li'l Ze' – is the top kingpin in the City of God. Ze's chief rival, as time goes by, is a ginger-top named Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele). As Carrot and Ze' fight each other for control of, well, everything, Rocket tries hard to stay above and out of the fray. He's not entirely successful.The movie is quickly paced. If you don't pay attention you may lose track of who's who, if only because there are plenty of supporting characters. Alice Braga, niece to one Sonia Braga, plays a one-time love interest for Rocket. Hers was the only familiar face for me, but many of the fine young actors (or nonactors, as the case may be) offered compelling standout performances.And this was all based on a true story, as they say. During the closing credits news footage, including interviews with gang members, is shown. The real Rocket appears, as well. Most striking? Might be the group of little kids known as the Runts; this cohort robs, maims, and kills everyone they can – ostensibly under the control of Carrot, but truthfully subservient to none. Close your eyes and imagine a five-year-old kid shooting someone in cold blood. That was this slum in this time period.",9,2,4,1 July 2016
Cars," You'll have fun, fun, fun with this zoomer
","On his way to a big event in California, a conceited race car finds himself stuck in Radiator Springs, a tiny town in the middle of the desert. It's a typical podunk burg, the very epicenter of Hicksville, and the clean n' shiny supercharger doesn't know how to cope. But cope he must, as during his grand entrance he wrecked a good portion of the town's road.Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a pretty sheltered car - he doesn't even have headlights, since race cars don't need them (the whole track's lit, y'see). But he's not happy with his life as it currently stands; he dreams of winning the famed Piston Cup - even better, of becoming the first rookie car to do so. But the final race of the season winds up a three-way tie, thanks in equal parts to Lightning's refusal to stop for new tires midrace and his apparently long tongue. At any rate, a special race is scheduled in one week's time. Naturally, along the way, Lightning is somehow separated from the truck transporting him, and he finds himself in the active, hoppin' Radiator Springs.At first the judge in town, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), just wants Lightning to leave as soon as possible, but he's quickly convinced otherwise by Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), who thinks Lightning oughta fix the road he's done tore up. Which is only fair, seeing also as he's the only vehicle in town with enough horsepower to pull the big ol' tarring contraption.While he's there, Lightning naturally makes the acquaintance of the other (few) citizens. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), the town tow truck, immediately befriends Lightning; others include Ramone (Cheech Marin), Flo (Jenifer Lewis), Fillmore (George Carlin), Luigi (Tony Shalhoub), and Sarge (Paul Dooley).By now, we're all used to Pixar's animation prowess, but they constantly top themselves. There are no humans in his film. It's not that there aren't any in the story, there aren't any in the cars universe. For instance, the stands at the races are filled with vehicles of all kinds (the inner circle is filled with RV trailers). The motel in Radiator Springs is a series of - get this - traffic cones. The pit crews are made up of small, handy vehicles. There's even a field populated not by cows but by tractors (Lightning and Mater go tractor tipping), watched over by a gigantic plow.But even with all of the cars, trucks, and whatnot floating around, even more impressive is the absolute crystal-clear detail in the backgrounds, particularly the canyon and desert sequences. Even if you pause your DVD player and squint reaaaaally hard, you can't really tell that these aren't photographs. And, of course, when they're moving a regular speed your subconscious can't tell, either. Check out the splash when Sally and Lightning drive through a puddle, and tell me that's not as realistic as a photo. Go on, do it.As with the best Disney films, one has to care about the characters, I mean really care about what happens to them. It's not enough to have someone with dreams of success if that character isn't all that fascinating to begin with. But Lightning McQueen, bless his self-absorbed self, is appealing, even charming in a preening, egocentric kind of way. See, he's never really experienced life outside of his racing existence, and he's always seen his winning the Piston Cup as a way to better himself. Little does he know, of course, that his life will wind up being bettered by the denizens of Radiator Springs - and one certain Porsche in particular - whether he likes it or not! The movie's similar in theme to Michael J. Fox's Doc Hollywood (1991), in which a hotshot doctor gets stuck in a tiny town and has to offer medical services to get his car fixed.The entire cast is a hoot, especially Carlin's hippie, alternative-fuel Volkswagen minibus - a clear descendant of the comic's late sixties' Hippy Dippy Weather Man. Good times, good times.The main themes are enjoying what one has and embracing different and new people (er, vehicles), but there's also a side theme of innocent lost. Radiator Springs takes place on the famed Route 66, just a hair's width away from Interstate 40. It seems that back in the day, Radiator Springs was THE place to stop if one were traveling along 66. But then the interstate was built just to the north, bypassing the town by just a few minutes' drive. And now no one ever stops. It's a wry commentary on the real-life Route 66, what parts of it still exist, a true monument to the American spirit.A fantastic ride from start to checkered flag, Cars is the perfect animated feature - gaggles of giggles for the little tykes and a bevy of knowing jokes for the grownup kids.",9,0,0,10 December 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Hackneyed acting, stiff performances
","When this movie was released in the theater, much was made of it, particularly of its visual appeal. It was said to be a masterpiece, compelling, with luscious scenes and magnificent cinematography. 'Goodie,' I thought. 'I can't wait to see it on video.' Well, it's here. And I have just finished watching it. Those of you who have known me or who have been on this list for a while know my feelings about foreign films in general. I usually don't like to read subtitles, because it detracts from my enjoyment of the film. When I learned that this movie was dubbed, I was more interested, because I did not wish to be distracted from the striking visual scenes. However, the problem is that the movie's not terribly good. One major knock against Hollywood films - and a justly earned knock, too - is that more attention is paid to the special effects of a film than to the story. Well, newsflash - that knock applies to some foreign-made films as well. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a delight, as long as you don't pay attention to such trivialities as plot or character development.   Remember those old martial-arts films with Bruce Lee (and even the newer ones with Jackie Chan) that featured hilariously bad dubbing? Those movies were infamous for their dubbing. The tradition continues! That's one strike against the film. Oh sure, you must be thinking, of course the dubbing doesn't seem as flawless as it would be if the actors were using their natural voices. That's to be expected. But it wasn't that the dubbing didn't match up with the facial expressions of the actors, it was that the readings were absolutely soulless. The readings are usually terrible! And when they're not flat and uninspiring, they're overly dramatic. If this was a purely American enterprise, people would have hooted at it. The plot concerns the disappearance of a mystical jade sword, owned by the great warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). Li decides to give his sword to an old friend, but the sword is soon stolen by a mysterious assassin and her protege. Soon the protege has the sword, Li is fighting everyone in sight, people die, and there's a lot of mysticism. I might be oversimplifying the plot a little, but considering how needlessly complicated the plot is to begin with, I think I'm doing you all a favor in that regard! It is certainly true that the action scenes are unbelievable. You've all doubtless seen the commercials where one attacker walks up the side of a building. That's only the first trick to come out of the bag. As a martial arts film, this is a Picasso. But for those of us who prefer multilayered movies, ones featuring more than just a smattering of nominal plot devices, this is fingerpainting more suitable for a refrigerator.",5,0,0,23 June 2001
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A divot in the director's career
","It's not peak Tarantino, and that's the biggest flaw of this movie. Whole 'lotta nothing happens for more than two hours, leading to the kind of violent denouement that we'd expect from the auteur. In fact, if you didn't know Tarantino wrote and directed this, you would be none the wiser after watching the film. It's set in the fall of 1969, shortly before the infamous Tate-LaBianca murders in Hollywood, and it (mostly) follows the travails of a has-been TV actor named Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime friend and stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Dalton used to be the star of a show called Bounty Law, a western in which his character is sort of an antihero, but the show ended its run when Dalton wanted to strike out for the presumably greener pastures of movies. Now he's kind of washed up, working as a guest star on current shows as the bad guy. Meanwhile, his buddy Cliff is sort of Rick's gopher, his own career derailed by his actions on the set of The Green Hornet. Completing the trio - although separately - is actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), wife of director Roman Polanski, who lives next door to Dalton in the Hollywood Hills. Much of the movie has to do with everyday life for these three in 1969 Hollywood, and there are a ton of movie references - sort of a Tarantino hallmark. But as Dalton, Booth, and Tate go about their lives, nothing really stands out as...well, interesting or full of any meaning for the audience. What probably was meant to be a lot of little scenes leading up to a fantastic conclusion was really a bunch of vignettes. The casting is as eclectic as we've come to expect from Quentin Tarantino, but the script doesn't really make use of anyone save for DiCaprio. Pitt and Robbie aren't given a lot to do other than look pretty, and talent like Al Pacino, Brenda Vaccaro, Damien Lewis, and Bruce Dern are paid very short shrift. The whole thing feels like imitation Tarantino and is definitely not among his best work. This is a dull movie, even with the 'revised history' slant it tries to present.",6,13,21,5 August 2019
Gone Girl," Too far gone
","Like most husbands who live off their wealthy wives, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) isn't a terribly likable guy. He helps run a bar (paid for by his wife) and alternately plays video games and watches reality television. His marriage to Amy (Rosamund Pike) isn't going so well, after five years; from Nick's perspective, living under the thumb of his trust-fund wife is more than just a chore, it's excruciating. So it's understandable why, when it appears that Amy has been murdered in their home, Nick would be the prime suspect.In David Fincher's Gone Girl, the mystery appear to be not whodunit but rather why they did it and what the endgame really is. It's a little long (143 minutes) and has at least one too many denouements; just when you believe you have a vague handle on how things might go, the movie pivots elsewhere. Now, I'm one of those people who likes to find someone in the movie who has a strong personality, not necessarily a good guy but at least someone with whom I may be able to sympathize (to some degree) or to whom I can relate. I didn't find that to be the case in this film. Let me put it this way - Nick is an arrogant, self-pitying jerk, and Amy is a delusional sociopath. With no rooting interest and no discernible satisfying ending, watching the movie was a tedious experience.Nick is questioned by Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens), and a missing-persons report is immediately followed. Nick's not sure whether his wife has friends, or what her blood type is, or what she does during the day, all of which cast doubt on his innocence. A press conference is held. A hotline is set up. A midnight vigil is held. All standard operating procedure for a missing-persons case that's less than a day old. But with a real lack of other suspects or motives, the court of public opinion shortly turns against Nick. He's no longer the grieving husband (and son-in-law) but the conniving gold digger with all the necessary reasons for orchestrating his wife's demise. Plus, he has this attitude that oscillates between smug and defensive.The first half of the movie seems rather inert; the audience ping pongs between believing Nick is a villain. There are multiple reasons that indicate he's not all that innocent, although the bottom line is that he's just not a nice guy, and that's reason enough for the cable-TV crowd. After the police turn on Nick as well, a Nancy Grace impressionist (Missi Pyle) calls for his head. Nick turns to high-powered attorney Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), who advises him to appear on the show of an Oprah Winfrey copycat (Sela Ward). Affleck, through Nick, then turns in his best acting job while pretending to show contrition and humility on the television show.Gone Girl first asks us to imagine that Nick is blameless, planting the idea that the attack was staged, and then asks us to believe that Amy is just an innocent naif who's on the run from an abusive husband, and then asks us to pity Nick, and then Amy, and so on. The entire movie, although based on a book by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay), feels like a Lifetime movie that is itself ripped from tabloid headlines.We do finally get Amy's side of the story, but her situation and intention aren't terribly compelling. She's a meticulous planner, to the point where, in voice-over, she explains in minute detail every step in her scheme. The amount of organization is to be admired - except that later in the movie, she makes a mistake that would have been easily prevented by even a modicum of advance thinking. I found it hard to believe that someone who had gone to such great lengths to achieve her goal would be undone so effortlessly. The entire movie, although based on a book by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay), feels like a Lifetime movie that is itself ripped from tabloid headlines.Ben Affleck has played so many arrogant, smug, condescending jerks in his career that it's hard to imagine him as a vulnerable, mild-mannered guy. In the hands of a more capable actor, the role of Nick Dunne may have become much more nuanced, but instead we get a colorless, stereotypical performance by one of Hollywood's top leading men. It's a true shame, because he's surrounded by excellent performances - particularly by Carrie Coon, who plays his acerbic sister Margo, and Dickens. Both women turn make their characters layered, thoughtful, and ultimately intriguing. This contrasts sharply with Affleck's dismissive, distant style.This normally would be the kind of movie I'd love. The premise asks the question of what has happened to Amy Dunne. A mystery is afoot! But this mystery is solved within the first third of the movie, and the remainder of the film is endless filler. We're teased several times in the final third that this could finally be it, the ending. But it's not. It never is. Even the ending isn't an ending. According to reports, Flynn changed the ending of the script so that readers of the book wouldn't know what was coming. I'm not sure that ploy works, because there is no finale to speak of. There is no twist, just a longer piece of twine.",5,7,28,5 October 2014
Django Unchained," Unbroken, Unchained, Unbelievable
","Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be plantation owners, because if Django Unchained is any indication, things just don't bode well for you. Heck, you might want to think twice about letting them see a second of this movie, what with all the blood and guts and colorful language. But putting that aside, as we must, Django Unchained is clearly one of the best movies of 2012, even one of the very best of Quentin Tarantino's strong career.It's the antebellum South, and blacks and bought and sold like cattle. One of them, the titular Django, is being led through a thick forest, chained to several other male slaves, when a German dentist, a Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) frees him, slaying his captors and bidding the remaining slaves a fond adieu. Schultz's plan is simple. He is actually a bounty hunter, and he is on the trail of three men wanted for murder and train robbery. He has discovered that Django knows the men on sight, and Schultz himself does not. Thus he deputizes the still-technically-a- slave Django to help him find the three baddies; if Django can point out the men, Schultz will grant him his freedom. Their trek takes them to the plantation of one Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who's pretty vicious even by slaveholder standards. Schultz and Django pose as a duo who wish to purchase a mandingo fighter, with Django - as a free man - the proclaimed expert on such fighters. You see, Schultz and Django have an ulterior motive - they wish to find Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was sold separately from Django, and they have reason to believe she resides with Candie.As bullets fly and flecks and spurts of blood practically pirouette in the air, one can easily appreciate the majesty of the art of film. Yes, that's an over-the-top sentiment, but it doesn't apply to many movies. Quentin Tarantino is famed for trying to get just the right shot, much like Stanley Kubrick before him. There's a certain poetic symmetry to every cocked pistol, every framed desert background, every lash of a terrifying whip. This is a brutal film to watch, and it is unflinching in its depiction of the true evil of slavery. The domination of fellow man was bad enough, but the physical and ultimately psychological terrorism defies description. It was not a proud moment in our country's history.But we in the 21st century know all about that, and this film is not simply about the brutality of man versus man. Believe it or not, it is a love story and the lengths to which a man will go, the horrors that he will endure, to be reunited with his beloved. Foxx is astonishing as Django, who's played not as an overzealous vengeful machine but rather a taciturn, intelligent, multilayered man among men. Schultz, his conniving compatriot, is every bit as compelling as he was in Tarantino's earlier Inglourious Basterds; crisp, wise, always many steps ahead of his foe. DiCaprio is (surprisingly) convincing as the menacing, degenerate Candie. At one point, Candie rhetorically asks why, as he is always surrounded by black folks, none of them rise up to kill him; I wondered why there were no white women around him at all, save for his sister, whom he mouth kisses, but maybe that was just mere coincidence. I digress. Samuel L. Jackson turns up as the head black man on campus who serves his master well - but is he more Luke Skywalker or more Darth Vader? He's also almost unrecognizable playing a old, cane-leaning codger with the mouth of a sailor and the crusty sentimentality of the worst grandfather ever. It's a good role for him.I did mention this is one heck of a bloody movie, right? You've heard of Quentin Tarantino, right? Okay, then. If you dislike gory stuff, stay away. This is an homage to the old spaghetti Westerns of the past, although Tarantino himself refers to this one as a Southern, seeing as how it takes place mostly in the Deep South. That means confrontations with sheriffs, marshals, bandits, and other colorful - pardon the bad pun - people. It is not a pretty, romanticized ode to the West. It is a mean time filled with vile behavior, and of this comes the love of two.Now comes the raving part, or at least more of it. I loved this movie. Thought it was terrific from start to finish. Some twists, all plausible. And you should see the cast list - a who's who of who is that? Don Johnson? Tom Wopat? Franco Nero? Russ Tamblyn and his daughter Amber? I love Tarantino's casting. Not to gush, but it's always nice to see a director who appreciates cinema's long history. Add the attention to detail, the courage to show some grisly scenes that could cause one to look away in horror, and you have a rumbling roar of a movie.",9,2,10,29 December 2012
Drive," Full-speed existentialism
","The Driver (Ryan Gosling), it shall be noted, drives. Doesn't matter what for, what the odds are, if it's immoral or illegal, it's what he does. Perhaps that's a metaphor for his life, where he sees himself with one purpose and an incentive to be the very best at his vocation. We're led to believe that he exists to drive.He seems to split his time into three jobs: Hollywood stuntman, mechanic, and getaway car driver. One pays better than the others. He works with people with whom he's had little to no prior contact, and he has some rules. He gets his way, because he truly is a terrific driver with pinpoint reflexes. He says little, listens much, and does his job. Sort of the perfect employee, except for the times when one of his little rules is violated. But if they aren't, he will deliver your package on time.The Driver's life experiences no real bumps until he meets one of his neighbors, Irene (Carey Mulligan), who's apparently a single mom/waitress. They become friends, but nothing more. He helps her when her car breaks down, and she - what luck! - brings it to the garage where he and his boss Shannon (Bryan Cranston) work. Irene confesses that she's not single; her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in jail for reasons unknown. It is giving nothing away to mention that in short time Standard is released and confronts The Driver. But then they become friends, because why not? The Driver likes Irene, and she digs him, as does her kid, but he intuits that Standard, although full of bluster and machismo and probably running with the wrong people, isn't a terrible person. The Driver has no real need to rescue Irene. But, as he quickly learns, Standard does need to be rescued.It appears that The Driver does more than just drive. He cares. He's deadly with his hands and other objects. He can break into cars and elude police. He's tough but reticent. Very reticent, willing to let others dig their own holes before he dives in. He acts without telegraphing his move to everyone, particularly the audience. He's still wildly existential, but now it seems he exists as a man playing by rules of which only he is truly aware.Gosling is really something. Rather than giving us the impression that, because of his silence, he is dim witted or vulnerable, he shows us that there is much beneath his handsome exterior. We never know his motives other than a desire to help Irene, Standard, and their little boy - in fact, that motive alone seems to a new one on The Driver himself. Does it enrich him? Yes, but only because he mentions it himself; otherwise, he's the same cipher he's always been. Gosling's Driver isn't just a blank-faced object of desire; one can tell he's thinking about something, forming a plan, keeping it hidden deep within. I kind of wish he'd garnered an Oscar nom out of this performance.But he's not alone. Mulligan is excellent as the haunted, torn Irene - much better than she was in the ill-fated Shame from last year or even from An Education. She's sweet and cute but not naive and not the proverbial sex bomb. Cranston and Ron Perlman have showy roles as good and bad guys. But stealing the show - almost the entire movie - is Albert Brooks, yes, the comedian who has dabbled in dramatic acting in the past, who is unbelievable as Cranston's mob contact. He's terrifying but methodical, a horrifying combination if ever there was one.Drive is a work of art in many ways. It's meticulously edited by Mat Newman, and the sound is blended perfectly by the team of Lon Bender and Victor Ray Ennis, with the latter two earning Oscar nominations for themselves. Nicholas Winding Refn's direction is crisp, unyielding, confrontational, and engaging, particularly for one's first Big Movie. There's much to like in Drive if you're a fan of adrenaline-enhanced experiences that don't bludgeon you with CGI and other fakery. The level of realism is just right, both in the action scenes and in the person- to-person scenes.",9,4,8,20 February 2012
Bolt," Electrically entertaining from Trabolta
","In Bolt, a TV-show canine (John Travolta), who doesn’t know he’s on a TV show and therefore has no super powers, races across the country to find his TV girl-owner (Miley Cyrus), convinced she’s in the clutches of the evil Dr. Calico, the bad guy on the show. Aided by a cynical alley cat and a hamster in a transportation ball, Bolt must fight the forces of gravity and the other laws of physics to be reunited with his Penny in this sweet, charming Disney animated film.It’s encouraging to see a good Disney-only animated film for a change. Bolt does what an animated movie should do – it has a quick pace, it’s humanistic, it’s funny, and it’s adventurous. Oh, and there’s character growth. It’s no surprise that the intended audience – little kids, not me – found this entertaining, on average.Bolt, an American White Shephard, escapes from his trailer on the set of his hit television series and finds himself shipped to the East Coast. Thinking that his Penny is in imminent danger from the man with the green eye (played with the usual maniacal glee of Malcom McDowell), Bolt tries to use his super powers – super speed, the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes, a Super Bark – to rescue her. Of course, since he’s just a normal dog, these super powers don’t work, but they do lead to some hilarious physical comedy.One departure this movie offers is the casting of unknowns in key roles. Mittens the Cat is played by Susie Essman, and the scene-stealing Rhino the Hamster is voiced by Mark Walton. Who and who? And yet both actors are perfect for the roles. Sometimes it pays to cast someone based purely on their fit for a character, rather than hiring a “name” actor and letting their celebrity overtake the character completely. Which is how Disney did it for years and years; when the studio enjoyed its resurgence in 1989 with The Litter Mermaid, it cast Buddy Hackett amid character actors, and the landscape of animation changed. Next thing you know, you had Robin Williams in Aladdin and James Earle Jones in The Lion King. Not that these were bad casting choices, but they represented a change from olden times, for the most part.Travolta is excellent as the intrepid, resilient, and initially deluded Bolt, a canine who learns that his super powers come from within him. Why, he had the power to save Penny all along! All he had to do was click his heart together, and.. Oh, never mind. The point is, Bolt learns that help can come from unlikely sources (a cat!), and comic relief is always welcome (a hamster!) And Cyrus – who has limited screen time, compared with Travolta – is spot on as the innocent Penny, who pines for her lost pup. In fact, if it weren’t for an extended musical montage (sung by Jenny Lewis), this would have been a great movie instead of merely a very good one, but you can’t please everyone.",7,3,4,3 August 2009
2012," Funniest tragedy ever
","There is now a long, grand history of disaster films in Hollywood. The best of the lot have combined suspense with cutting-edge effects to keep your adrenaline pumping. The worst combine cheesy CGI with shallow characters whose deaths won't affect you much.Here's 2012, summed up: Look, some recognizable landmark! Kablam! Look, a giant wave! Wooo! Do our intrepid Good Guys have enough time to outrun the imploding planet and foil a plot to save only the pretty, rich people? Probably! It's pretty clear what happened to bring us to this point. Roland Emmerich, who's made such cinematic classics as Independence Day, The Patriot, Godzilla, and The Day after Tomorrow, was asked if he wanted a quintillion billion bazillion dollars to make a movie about the end of the world, and he said sure. Then he took parts of each movie's script, filmed them mostly with CGI, and pocketed the rest. Viola! Greatest movie! (A quick break to sum up the plot. Apparently, the sun and the planets have all aligned with the center of the galaxy, which winds up causing the Earth's crust to break up, which then causes the tectonic plates to shift. Mass hysteria! Dogs and cats, living together! The End.) See, there are two ways Emmerich could have gone with this movie. He could have given us characters to follow whom we cared a little about, thus involving us in their plights, and mixed in some convincing special effects. Or he could have said, 'The heck with the characters, give me blowy-uppy thingys.' This sometimes works: See Independence Day, a movie that made me feel pretty good when I left the theater after seeing it but that ultimately, frankly, was pretty bad.Emmerich chose the latter. Which would have been fine, but the effects themselves are wildly unrealistic and often take so long to set up that you completely notice how godawful they really are. For example – and if you've seen the trailer, this is in there – there's a scene in which the Sistine Chapel falls, crushing thousands of spectators. Because the toppling is so slow to complete, it becomes painfully obvious that it's just a film running on a screen behind people running away. Sad and unintentionally hilarious.And you can forget about the plot, really, because most of it makes no sense anyway and would happen only in a Big Movie like this. Of COURSE John Cusack is divorced from his hot, bitchy wife (Amanda Peet) and of COURSE she's hooking up with a plastic surgeon who of COURSE winds up having had some flying lessons that of COURSE will save them all and of COURSE Cusack's young son will somehow save the day as well and of COURSE there is a Russian businessman who used to be a boxing legend and of COURSE he punches someone out. And of COURSE people say 'My God!' a lot, because that's what people do in crappy disaster films. And of COURSE the president is black, because in Hollywood black people get to be president only if disaster is a-coming.At least the acting isn't horrible. Because everyone just runs from place to place in an effort to escape the horror, there aren't any subtle, low-key scenes that would allow good actors to flourish. Cusack is good in general, but what the heck is he doing in here? He's usually so good at picking projects, and he chose this? Willingly? Oliver Platt plays the kind of role that Bruce McGill typically gets, the hamhanded, I'm-in-charge, Al-Haig-like politician. I can't even remember his title. Danny Glover gets to be president and does get the best dialog in the film, even if his role isn't a big one. Woody Harrelson, as a crazed DJ deep in Yellowstone is also a lot of fun, although he's not the kind of guy you'd want to sit next to on a transatlantic flight.Final verdict: Yikes. Yikes, yikes, and yikes. If you dare watch this travesty, you might find yourself laughing hysterically at things – and this is important – that were not meant to be funny. If that's your thing, this is your movie. I managed to see this as a matinée, so I'm not out the $10-$15 that some people are right now, so at least I got that going for me. Best advice: Watch it for free at home on a big-screen TV to fully appreciate the magnitude of suck.",2,454,708,3 December 2009
The Number 23," 5 for creepiness, 8 for Madsen, 5 for Carrey, 5 for movie
","The Number 23 is a stylish thriller about a man who reads a screwy book and becomes obsessed with the titular number. Sounds intriguing, but there's simply not enough substance behind the style (perpetrated by director Joel Schumacher and cinematographer Matthew Libatique) to justify the ominousness. The movie feels like a conspiracy theory spouted off by a aged wino, although Jim Carrey, as the suddenly changed protagonist, is appropriately grim and unhinged throughout.Carrey is Walter Sparrow, a pet-control officer (i.e., dog catcher) who begins reading a self-published, self-printed book called 'The Number 23' by a pseudonymous author, Topsy Kretz, that seems to eerily mirror Walter's own life and that points to 23 as a number steeped in meaning. As Walter reads, he becomes more and more attuned to the number's presence, even creating grand stretches of truth to make it fit (such as sometimes adding the digits of numbers to get 23, and other times adding the combined numbers, anything to reach the goal). In between reading the book - which most of us would probably finish in an evening but that Walter takes many days to complete - Walter has vivid nightmares that end with his killing his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen).The question isn't really whether Walter's insane, because clearly he's a bit not sane. The question is, as posited by the movie, whether the number 23 has any kind of particular hold over certain people. The movie doesn't address why some people who read the book don't get all bent out of shape over it, or why this particular number is more powerful than any other number. It simply tells us that the number 23 Means Something, and that Something is never a good thing.Walter's desperate attempts at retaining his sanity and solving the mystery of the unknown author draw both Agatha and their thirteen-year-old (what, not 23?) son into the situation, which is good, because it gives Carrey something to react to other than mood lighting and creepy basements. Carrey leaves most of the shameless, doofus mugging aside for a more 'serious' - scare quotes totally necessary - acting here, opting instead for a mostly constant eye-lolling hysteria and paranoia.If the movie had wound up being a stark psychological thriller with no easy ending, it might have been serviceable, but instead it's wrapped up way too neatly for such a plot based in mysticism and conspiracies. At the end, you kind of expect someone to remove a rubber mask and say they would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for that meddling thirteen-year-old kid, his bookstore-owning milf-like mom, and his wacko dad. In short, the ending is trite and utterly predictable, a little too realistic and believable in a movie that could have used a shot of imagination adrenaline.",5,0,2,27 August 2007
Ghost Rider," Hysterically funny
","Ghost Rider is hilarious. Unspeakably, hysterically funny. Sadly, though, it's all unintentional humor. The movie manages to pack in every comic book and action movie cliché imaginable, laughable casting, an illogical script, wooden acting, and jarring direction for straight-faced amusement.Johnny Blaze is a 17-year-old tyro who works in a circus as part of a daredevil motorcycle act with his father. When he learns his dad's got cancer, Johnny makes a literal deal with the Devil (played by a cardboard cutout of Peter Fonda) to save his dad's life. That lasts about one day, because the next evening Johnny's dad dies during a performance. 'Nooooooooooooo!' shouts Johnny. Which is kind of what you'll be yelling when you watch the movie.Johnny has a girl, too, Roxanne. The night before the fateful performance, she tells him she's moving away - her dad, skeptical about Johnny's ability to stay alive in such a dangerous line of work, is sending her to live with her mother. Roxanne informs Johnny of this the very moment he's done carving an elaborate 'Johnny + Roxanne Forever' mark into a huge, old tree. Apparently she didn't want to ruin his concentration before dropping the bombshell. The two decide to run away together anyway, but then Johnny's pop dies, and Johnny runs off on his own to become the World's Awesomest Motorcycle Dude.Meanwhile! Elemental angels in league with the Devil's son, Blackheart, are trying to get a contract giving them control over the souls of some long-dead town. With these souls, Blackheart can rule the world, or something. (It's unclear how all of the souls of one tiny town in the middle of nowhere would give anyone the power to rule anything bigger than a hamburger stand.) And, it seems, when Johnny made his deal with the Devil he became the Ghost Rider, responsible for transporting the contracts of souls to the Devil; Blackheart wants to intercept the contract so he can usurp power from his dad.Fast forward one year later. Yes, one year. Johnny has changed from being 17 to being... Nicolas Cage. Cage is 43 years old. This makes no sense. Oh, and of course he runs into old flame Roxanne, too, now played by Eva Mendes. Or, more accurately, played by Eva Mendes' chest, which is prominently on display whenever possible. Mendes is 32 years old. She is, ostensibly, playing an 18 year old. Even more amusingly, Roxanne is now a television reporter. At 18, it's more likely she'd be assistant gopher to the producer. Ever the professional, even when on the air Roxanne wears low-cut tops, the better to distract the viewer from her inane questions.One gets the impression that Cage signed on to this role merely because he sports a Ghost Rider tattoo, which, ironically, had to be covered up for the movie. It's kind of as if Jerry Seinfeld were tapped to play Superman. You get all of Cage's mannerisms - the tics, the hangdog expression, the mouth-agape gaze, the laconic attitude. Not really what you expect from a comic-book hero. Mendes is fun to look at, but her delivery is paradoxically flat. Rounding out the cast are a couple of old timers - Sam Elliot plays Caretaker, a wily old coot as only Sam Elliot could play him. Elliot's a fantastic actor, and he's a much better fit for his role here than anyone else in this sludgy claptrap, but he can't save the movie. He's not even on screen until around the halfway point of the movie. Peter Fonda, looking weathered and sort of beaten-down, is The Devil; he's sort of aloof and unconvincing. Oh yeah, and Wes Bentley, who once was in American Beauty, is Blackheart, sans Joan Jett. Geez, they could have gotten any gothy-looking nitwit to play this role, it was so over-the-top. Bentley does not make a good villain.Let's be clear here. This isn't supposed to be a funny movie. It's a straightfaced, comic-book tale of a haunted young man. And yet the movie's so ineptly presented, one can't help but laugh. Questions abound: Why does Ghost Rider not even show up until a good way into the movie? Why are we told Johnny's jumping 300 feet (a football field) when the distance is longer than that (360 feet)? Why, when Johnny asks the Devil if he's the one responsible for keeping Johnny alive through all his death-defying feats, does the Devil say, 'No, that was all you, Johnny'? (Was it? If you're the Devil and you NEED this guy to be your Ghost Rider, and your guy is in a line of work in which he's constantly in harm's way, wouldn't you help him so he doesn't, you know, die?) When Johnny stops his cycle on a busy freeway so he can chat with Roxanne, blocking traffic, how come no one drives around his bike and her van? There are two lanes. Why, if Blackheart's a supernatural (and presumably immortal) being, does Caretaker toss Johnny a kick-ass shotgun with which to attack Blackheart? Why is the church where Caretaker lives and works sacred, hallowed ground that Blackheart cannot trod upon, but other churches - including the one in the tiny, middle-of-nowhere village - are not? Why, when Ghost Rider races through the city one night, inadvertently causing destruction, does exactly one car flip up and smash into a window, despite there being dozens of other vehicles around it? How come Ghost Rider can be hurt if you stab him in the shoulder blade, but you can't wound him by shooting him? (Some of these questions may have actual answers, but I didn't get them from the movie.)So the movie's pretty much useless, and in a week or so we'll have forgotten it ever existed. It's poorly acted, directed, and written and offers little in the way of solid entertainment - unless, of course, you're looking for some unintentional laughs.",1,161,257,23 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Better than 1 or 2
","I liked X Men. I liked X2 a little bit more. And I think that X Men: The Last Stand puts them both to shame. And the best part is that not only are the special effects astounding, the plot twists and character changes will make your jaw drop.Seems a research lab headquartered on Alcatraz Island has created what they term a 'cure' for the mutant gene; that is, a mutant who is injected with the serum will be transformed into a nonmutant - normal, in the view of the makers of the drug. This naturally causes consternation and confusion among the myriad mutants. Do they take the medicine and leave their life of mutancy? Or do they renounce it, choosing to remain true to themselves? Magneto (Ian McKellen) doesn't want to take the chance, realizing that with this serum the government - which has been hunting him - could effectively eliminate all mutants, whether they want to be 'cured' or not. His plan is to raise an army of disaffected, resentful mutants and destroy the serum - along with any who stand in his way, including Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his team.There are plenty of other subplots, all of which intertwine gracefully with the main thread. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), thought to have died at the end of X2, reappears - but is she the same Jean Grey they all know and love? And what's up with her and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), anyway? And what of poor Rogue (Anna Paquin), who's frustrated at not being able to hold her boyfriend Iceman (Shawn Ashmore)? The screen crackles with sexual tension on many levels, among many mutants. And of course many of the mutants' powers carry an undercurrent of sexuality all on their own.New to the cast is Kelsey Grammar as Hank McCoy, aka Beast, the Secretary of Mutant Affairs. He's big, blue, and furry, and he's basically the liaison between the mutants and the government. Only the government's a little leery of mutants, now that Magneto's waging war against them.You know how there are some movies that give you OH MY GOD moments? I don't mean wowie-kazowie special effects - like, say, moving the Golden Gate Bridge - I mean more like I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT TO THAT CHARACTER! Even if you're not an X Men fanatic, you do have a sense of who's who in the X Men universe, who's more important than whom. And more often than not, although you know bad things will happen to the heroes, they'll probably all live to fight another day. In X3, though, there's a strong sense of unease throughout the movie - indeed, will they all survive? i've heard conflicting reports about whether this is the final X Men film, but I really hope not. In fact, I'd prefer an X Men 4 to a spin off of Wolverine or Magneto, or any of the other characters. This is a cast of characters that acts supremely well as a team, and my impression is that however compelling the actor is, the characters might not be strong enough to carry a film on the level of the X Men films. I mean, look at Daredevil and Catwoman.All in all, the X Men movies have been progressively better, never letting up and never allowing the viewer to get comfortable with the plot; doing so would lead to the usual predictable, unimaginative story lines that sink most big-budget movies.",8,2,5,27 May 2006
Room," A Series of Plodding Events
","At the start of Room, a young woman and her five-year-old son are living in the titular edifice, a backyard shed. The woman (Brie Larson) has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that 'outer space' is all that exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.It is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles – the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.I had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.To say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.Once they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.The acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good – as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).But the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them – or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled 'A Series of Plodding Events.' The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie.",6,23,54,30 September 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Epic scenes save Towers
","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Dourif, Sean Astin Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 2:59
There are two types of people who will watch this movie: Those who read the books and wand to see the visions brought to life, and those who saw the first movie in the trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring) but haven't read the books (and perhaps don't plan to do so).The latter group will be more receptive to The Two Towers than the former, because director Peter Jackson takes some major liberties with the plot. As most people are aware, there are three books (The Return of the King is the final in the trilogy). There are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. This is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books.That said, there are some major plot deviations in The Two Towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. If one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either The Two Towers book or The Return of the King book. If one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. So this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation.The movie picks up right where the last one left off. Now, I'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen The Fellowship of the Ring. When that movie concluded, the original Fellowship had lost two (Boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain The One Ring, and Gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of Moria), and the remaining seven were separated. Frodo, the Ringbearer, and his servant Sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to Mordor. Their fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain Boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any Halfling, since they don't know which one has The One Ring. Aragorn the Ranger, Gimli the Dwarf, and Leglolas the Elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue Merry and Pippin.The first movie clearly belonged to Frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. He alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting Ring to its demise in Mount Doom. But the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: Gollum. Gollum has a long history with the Ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. He wants it, his Precious, back in his possession. He joins up with Frodo and Sam to lead them to the Black Gate, the terrible entrance to Mordor itself, home of Sauron, the maker of the Ring (who desperately wants it back). Gollum likes Frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the Hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain The Ring. It's interesting to note that Gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. This isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's Gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing Frodo and Sam. In fact, director Jackson had Andy Serkis (who voices Gollum) act in the scenes with Sam and Frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated Gollum. The result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character.But the story's not just about Frodo and his quest. Sauron knows the Ring's out there, and that a Halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. His goal is to wipe out mankind forever. That might be tough in today's world, but in Middle-Earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. Saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called Uruk-hai. The Uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of Rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). By casting a spell on the king, Theoden, Wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. Wormtongue is working for Saruman, who's working for Sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). In addition, the kingdom of Rohan has been set against that of Gondor, the other remaining Man kingdom. Together, they might be trouble for the Enemy; separate, they can be picked apart.One of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at Helm's Deep. After being removed from his spell, Theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by Aragorn, Leglolas, and Gimli. The Uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. There have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. It's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer.Now, as I said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. I don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. But when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, I have a problem. These books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. I won't go into details here about what 'new' scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but I was scratching my head after a few of them (and I had just reread The Two Towers a month or so ago).There's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. Arwen, the Elvish beauty who had a thing for Aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains Aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. There's a new female character as well: Eowyn, the daughter of the Rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for Aragorn.There are some funny moments as well, most of them involving Gimli the Dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in Fellowship. This can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing Gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough Dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a 'comic' character. The chemistry between him and Leglolas the Elf is excellent, however.One thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from Frodo himself. Elijah Wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. As the story wears on, Frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. But Wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, 'Why am I here with these actors?' The performance is flat and ineffectual. And although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from Frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, Sam, and Gollum, Wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. Luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes.It's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. Remember Back to the Future II? Wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. It was just kind of there. The Two Towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. Unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. And not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either.
This movie isn't as good as The Fellowsip of the Ring, but it's still very, very good. I'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. It's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either.",8,1,1,19 December 2002
Across the Universe," Lennon me, when you're not strong.
","Across the Universe is a sublime, beautiful story loosely based on Beatles songs and set against the harsh reality of the Vietnam War. The combination of timeless music with Oscar-nominated costume design yields a thematically coherent work of art that spreads its message of love and understanding to great success.The story centers around a Liverpudlian named Jude (Jim Sturgess) who joins the merchant marines and then jumps ship once he gets to the United States, ostensibly to look up his American father. He meets a wild young man named Max (Joe Anderson) who's wreaking havoc on the Harvard campus, and Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a straight-arrow babe in the woods. Jude and his friends have fun and adventures and suffer the various tragedies of life from the early 1960s through to the early 1970s, pretty much aping how John Lennon spent his time during that period.Almost all of the characters in this story have some sort of Beatles connection. Jude refers to the song 'Hey Jude,' which itself referred to Lennon's son Julian. Lucy refers to 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,' and Max refers to 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' But that ain't all. Jude and Max eventually get an apartment together, and their landlady is named Sadie (Dana Fuchs), after 'Sexy Sadie); the character herself is an homage to Janis Joplin. Sadie's musician boyfriend is Jo-Jo, from 'Get Back,' and he's an homage to Jimi Hendrix. There's a friend named Pru ('Dear Prudence'), too. But here's what's really neat. The songs used in the movie aren't shoehorned in there to fit with the characters' names, and vice versa. Director Julia Taymor allows the viewer to become immersed in the world of Jude and Lucy without being distracted by what's really a constant stream of Beatle references.This is not a small achievement, either. From a Cavern Club show to a rooftop performance, there are scores of people, places, and events relating the Lennon and his bandmates, and it doesn't stop there. At one point Jude and the gang get on a bus that's on its way to see Dr. Timothy Leary, just like Ken Kesey's famous transcontinental trek some fifty years ago. There's a musical number devoted to the song 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,' and if ever a song really shouted out for a musical number, that's it. Eddie Izzard, of all people, plays the titular Kite, and he's surrounded by Blue Meanies. Trust me, if you're not high when you watch that scene, you'll feel like you are anyway.But at the center of the madness is the beautiful love story of Jude and Lucy, one a struggling artist who is passionate about pacifism and one who supports more proactive protest measures. As one might expect in any time period, their love becomes strained and even vanishes for a while. After all, this isn't a musical rooted in fantasy. Kids are sent off to war in Taymor's vision, and they don't always come back.Across the Universe seems to capture the spirit, the angst, and the hope that embodied the period. It's a bit long, over two hours, but if you do make it to the end you should find the final number to be a real heart stopper. Honest, winning performances from everyone really seal the deal.",9,1,2,23 September 2014
The Incredibles," How about just The Okays?
","A superhero family, under duress from multiple lawsuits brought by otherwise-well-meaning citizens of the city they protect, goes into deep hiding, a Federal Witness Protection program for those with superpowers.But the patriarch of the family, Mr. Incredible, chafes under his now-mundane existence, complete with a job as a health-insurance claims manager. Poor Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson)! He pines so badly for the good IL' days that he and Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) secretly listen to police communications via a scanner, then rescue people and stop bad guys.On the other hand, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is very happy with her new suburban life as Helen Parr. She and Bob (nee' Incredible!) have three kids: Dashiell (who can run really really fast), Violet (who can turn invisible and create force fields), and baby Jack Jack, who appears to have no powers - yet. She's content, Elastigirl is, although she doesn't like it when the family has to move - again - because Bob got fired from another job, usually owing to the use of his superduper powers.So one day when Bob gets a message from a supersecret organization that wants him to thwart an evil robot that can learn from its own mistakes... well, Bob sees no reason to mention it to Helen. Or that he was just fired from his crappy job. Nope, he decides that the company is sending him out of town for a 'conference.' Will Mr. Incredible indeed save the day? Or will Elastigirl (and crew) have to save his sorry butt for him?This Pixar film was a little uneven for my tastes. The first half of the movie dragged noticeably; this half didn't seem very well paced at all. In fact, I even committed the cardinal sin of checking my watch a few times - that's how dull it was. But during the second half, things really picked up. The action was much more ubiquitous, with some of the most eye-popping scenes in animation. Scenes that made one forget that the movie was animated, which is basically the point of the Pixar animators.But because of the slow first half, this movie didn't charm me as much as previous Pixar films had effortlessly done. In fact, the difference between the two halves of the movie is so stark it almost seems as if two directors were responsible for the movie. There are also a few emotionally strong scenes that your youngest kidlets might not be too fond of, aside from the cartoon violence. There is a scene in which Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl argue loudly, a scene that might hit a little close to home for some children. And because animation is looking more and more realistic, it may be more difficult for kids to see this as a cartoon rather than a live-action movie, to a certain degree, so even scenes of typical cartoon-superhero violence might be a little intense. As it is, this is Pixar's first PG-rated movie, so be warned.",6,0,2,19 November 2004
The Mist," Poor ending, but overall gory and chilling
","Stephen King's 1983 short story (more of a novella, really) is pretty well realized for the big screen by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption), although the ending might leave viewers cold, not chilled. The effects are excellent, as Hollywood strangely (and wisely!) decided to ease off the overproduced special effects for a change, and the result is that when we do see the creatures, we're suitably terrified, especially since the camera never lingers long on any of them.The basic setup is that a storm of the century has shut down the power in a small New England town, and the next morning a thick mist is rolling across the town's large lake. Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) gathers his eight-year-old son and, accompanied by his caustic neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), heads to the supermarket to load up on groceries. When they get there, they find that pretty much everyone else in town has the same idea. And it seems like just the usual bad-weather madness until a local citizen bursts into the store, blood on his chest, screaming about how creature from the mist took his friend, and dadgum it everyone better GET INSIDE CLOSE THE DOOR AAAH THEY'RE COMING, and sure enough, as the doors are closed, the mist comes rolling in, and people stay the heck where they are. But it soon becomes apparent that this is no ordinary mist, and that old man might have been on to something - something IS out there, but the mist is so thick no one can tell what it is. And that's where the story really gets under your skin. What manner of creature is outside the store's walls? Is it faster than a man trying to get to his car? Is it small, but vicious? Or is it gigantic? Is it even benign? (No, it's not.)In other, less-deft hands, a story like this would have been a typical monster movie, as our Intrepid Hero saves the world from sure destruction. But this isn't about man versus the monster, it's about man versus the unknown - and man versus man. Almost all of the action takes place inside the supermarket. There are level-headed (but scared) people, like Dave, Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), Ollie (Toby Jones), and Irene (Frances Sternhagen), and then there are the so-scared-they're-irrational people, like Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) and Jim Grondin (William Sadler), and Norton. In a lesser movie, the theme would be that all of them must work together in order to survive, but that theme isn't given a chance here, as would be the case in real life. There's no rousing speech about how everyone's in this together; people become unhinged and unwilling to listen to reason at the drop of a hat, because the unknown of the mist is too much to bear.That's where Mrs. Carmody comes in. She's a Bible-thumping fanatic of the Old Testament, and she sees the mist and its denizens as a sign from the Almighty, and as the movie progresses she becomes more and more like a seer to the easily swayed - and sees herself as a righteous martyr who will someday sit beside God. In other words, a disaster like the mist gives a kook like Mrs. Carmody the perfect opportunity to save souls, whether they want to be or not, and her zeal gives the lesser-minded individuals something they can hold on to, rather than using their minds for practical survival.Dave acts as the de facto leader of the survivors, mostly because no one else steps forward, not even the three almost-on-leave soldiers trapped in the store. But not only must he find a way to get out of the store and past the creatures, but he has to deal with the escalating insanity of Mrs. Carmody, whose rantings attract a larger and larger congregation, ending in tragedy.The only real issue I have with the movie is the ending, which differs wildly from that in King's original printed story. You would think that a Hollywood ending would be more tangible, thus giving the viewer better closure. Well, we do get some closure, but the result is that you feel like you've been kicked in the stomach. The finale is so unsatisfying, you wonder what the heck the preceding two hours were supposed to be for.",7,1,6,25 November 2007
Stardust," Delicious, striking sets and rich, beautiful acting
","Stardust is a lush fantasy story about love, dark magic, evil witches, entitlements of inheritance, and the twinkling stars in the sky. It is gorgeously filmed and well paced, and its denouement will make your heart soar.For the unrequited love of a girl, young Tristan (Charlie Cox) vows to bring back a fallen star. But once he makes it to the crater where the star hit, he realizes the star isn't a rock at all - it's a beautiful young lady named Yvaine (Claire Danes), who's none to pleased to have fallen from her high-and-mighty perch in the firmament. But promises being promises, Tristan ensnares Yvaine using an enchanted chain and begins their journey back to his village, so that he may present the star to his love, Victoria (Sienna Miller).But Tristan and Yvaine are unwittingly part of a larger story; the king of the enchanted realm (Peter O'Toole) has just died, and the new ruler will be he among the sons who possesses the kingdom's sacred ruby, which the dying king had tossed up into the heavens, where it smacked into Yvaine, thus bringing her crashing to Earth. Now all the king's remaining sons are on the hunt for the ruby, not knowing Yvaine wears it around her neck.Meanwhile, three witch sisters have noticed the falling star, which is a major omen in the kingdom of Stormhold; whoever can possess the fallen star will be immortal. You don't have to be pure evil to think immortality might be kind of fun, so the oldest of the sisters, Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) sets off to find it as well.During the long journey back home, Tristan learns about love and his own parentage. Oh, does he learn about love! With a griping, angry denizen of the sky as his prisoner, Tristan thinks he has everything worked out; he'll present Yvaine to Victoria, who will marry him instead of the cad Humphery (and really, could he be anything but a cad, with that name?).This is more than a simple fantasy story of good versus evil. It's about telling the difference between being infatuated and being in love; it's about trust and righteousness; it's about doing the right thing, even when it seems impossible to do so.Based on a Neil Gaiman story, Stardust is impeccably written (it was adapted for the screen by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman), with rich characterizations, top-notch acting, and wondrous visual effects. Robert DeNiro gets a showy role as the captain of a flying ship (sort of a cross between a dirigible and a pirate ship), and although it IS a showy role, DeNiro is far from hammy in it - he is, in fact, outstanding. Pfeiffer is remarkably despicable as the ugly-then-beautiful-then-ugly rotten witch Lamia. She doesn't dress down for the role, she dresses down and dirty and Lamia is not a shallow, one-dimensional character in the least. A lesser actress would have played the part a little over the top, portraying Lamia as a power-mad demagogue obsessed with looking pretty, but Pfeiffer delivered a multilayered performance, fulsome in its depth.Danes is also a huge asset here. Her dancing eyes and rubied lips (matching the stone, of course), coupled with the CGI-added glow about her (since she is, after all, a fallen star) lend a real ethereal feel to her character, but it's her acting that lends the appropriate gravitas; otherwise, Yvaine would be a simple, irritated version of Victoria.And although the role of Tristan might have been given to an actor offering only a callow performance, Charlie Cox is fantastic as the protagonist. He doesn't just let things happen to him, he makes things happen through decisive actions, good or bad. He's forthright and honest; he's just blinded by the prospect of love from Victoria.Exquistely photographed and with quick, efficient pacing that doesn't let itself get bogged down in the special effects of the moment, Stardust is a real treat for fans of fantasy novels and movies.",8,2,2,24 February 2008
I Am Legend," Wonderful Smith, well-directed thriller
","Anyone familiar with Richard Matheson's story about the last man to survive a massive worldwide plague will have very little to complain about regarding this newest adaptation, with Will Smith as the slightly crazed Dr. Robert Neville, the harried former military doctor who's been waiting for signs of other survivors for three long years.Every day, Neville gather supplies from throughout New York City, and every evening, at dusk, he shutters his abode against the onslaught of zombie creatures that live only in the dark. Well, against those who'd attack if they knew where he lived. Which they don't, really. And Neville has it made, at least in terms of resources. He has generators for electricity, so he can cook his own food (and for his dog, Sam). He has great security. He can watch movies to his heart's content. But after three years, he's more than a little lonely - he's beginning to go crazy. (He's even positioned mannequins in the video store so he can 'converse' with them each day.) We have a vague idea of what caused 99% of the Earth's population to die, but the movie's more concerned with the aftermath; how Neville survives, and how he lost his family. (Hint: It's not because of the plague.) And this is where the strength of Will Smith comes into play. Until recently, Smith was mostly Action Guy - Independence Day, Bad Boys, I, Robot, and so on - and basically thrived on dopey catch phrases. Good news! There are no catch phrases in this movie. In fact, Smith has to actually emote and act, and damn if he doesn't do an exemplary job. Remember when Tom Hanks chatted up a volleyball? Same sorta thing, only Smith's talking to his German Shepherd; he needs to in order to keep hold of the tenuous gossamer strands of his slippery sanity.When he's not out gathering provisions and scouting for people, Neville is busy in his basement lab, trying desperately to reverse the virus and cure everyone. I'm not sure about the science angle of this, but since Neville himself is immune, he figures he can inject one of the zombie creatures with his blood, but that doesn't work. So he keeps at it, adding things, taking away things. It's all very scientific.Smith's beautiful, evocative performance is among the best he's ever given, about on par with the maudlin The Pursuit of Happiness; I Am Legend is an action movie that doesn't smack you over the head every five seconds with, well, more action; it instead builds suspense and then pays off. Multiple times. One reason this works is that director Francis Lawrence employed a hand-held camera during many of the more violent scenes, and it's usually a pretty effective method - it's just that sometimes the zigzagging is a little jarring. Still, not a big problem.There are some differences between this movie and the original story, but they're not bad differences, exactly; an example of a story being updated while not being demonstrably altered. And here's another plus - although you do get to see the creatures - and they're pretty nasty looking - you don't see them often enough to get used to them, or their hideous screeches, or their no-holds-barred, uninhibited, visceral behavior.",8,1,4,15 December 2007
22 Jump Street," Come for the witty banter! Stay for the post-credits!
","Yes! 22 Jump Street is even better than the original movie. Or the TV show, for that matter. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have terrific chemistry, perhaps the best in comic cop movies since some guys named Gibson and Glover (over and over) were roaming the streets of LA. The laughs come fast and furious and are generally not of a PG nature, although apparently that was of no concern to the family of four behind me in the theater.Officers Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) are now enrolled in college, trying to nail down the source of a new designer drug (again) that's overtaking the campus. They remain in their high-school guises from the first film, mismatched brothers. Their handler, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), is sort of glad to see the boys again, since their previous success resulted in a huge budget increase. Which he exploits to the hilt. (I wonder if he ever did get that shark tank.)Anyway, Jenko and Schmidt try to find out where the new drug WHYPHY ('Work hard - why? Play hard - why?) is coming from. Their only lead is a photo of one student buying it from another, with one of the students later winding up dead. Jenko pals around with the jocks, which include possible suspects Zook (Wyatt Russell, Kurt's son) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), while Schmidt falls into the boho scene, meeting cute with Maya (Amber Stevens), to whom he develops a kind of liking.For those of us who thought that the title sounded pretty lame, well, it's better than '21 Jump Street 2,' right? And of course, this film being as self-aware as a film can be, there's a reason - Jump Street HQ is now located across the street from the old place, since the Koreans wanted their church back. Makes sense.Much of the plot does indeed follow that of the first film, but as Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) tells them, the boys should handle this case the same way they handled the high-school one. It's what the brass wants! But the taking-down-the-bad-guys plot is only window dressing for the real problem, the conflict between the partners as they discover that they've become more different than they were in 'high school.' Is it possible that they'll need to go their separate ways in order to finish this case? Will this be the last case? Well, no, that's not likely. But the first one is possible. Remember, in 21 Jump Street, somehow Schmidt was the cool guy and Jenko was the schlub who had to hang out with the AV guys (who, naturally saved the day). This time, not so much - Jenko is a BMOC, what with the being strong and apparently immune to alcohol and such. Schmidt is now the one with some doubts about their partnership, and that's the real story behind the story. He can't follow in Jenko's path, or even walk alongside him, because people like the jocks don't want him around. And suddenly Jenko sees his partner as a hindrance, someone preventing him from his true calling - football player. Much mirth is made of the similarities between the duo's partnership and a full-blown emotional relationship. At one point they even visit a psych professor (well, it's to get info about a patient who had taken WHYPHY, but still) and wind up revealing more of their feelings than they may have intended.It's hard to imagine better casting for the roles of Jenko and Schmidt. Tatum and Hill appear to have been working together for decades, honing an act to impeccable heights, so good is their banter. But the fun doesn't stop with them - Ice Cube is a terror as a father and a cop, Rob Riggle and Dave Franco happily reprise their roles from 21 Jump Street (the movie), there's another cameo of a veteran of the 'old' TV show, and both Amber Stevens and Jillian Bell (playing Maya's roommate) are killer good. Also on hand is the usually oily Peter Stormare as, surprise, the bad guy.For whatever reason, I'm much more inclined to laugh out loud at a movie while at home than when I'm at the theater, but I couldn't stop laughing (or giggling, possibly when Jenko and Schmidt inadvertently take some of the designer drug). The movie was that funny. 22 Jump Street is definitely as good as the first, and for my money it's a step up.",9,0,4,22 June 2014
Cars 2," Top shelf sequel
","Pixar seems immune to the problems that studios normally have with their sequels, in that Pixar's sequels don't, you know, stink. Cars 2, like the Toy Story films, captures every bit of sincerity, thrills, and pitch-perfect animation that the original did. It's a beautifully shot movie with terrific voice characterizations, including a surprisingly awesome turn by Larry the Cable Guy.In the movie, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has settled down in Radiator Springs with his girlfriend Sally Carerra (Bonnie Hunt) when he is goaded into joining a three-country race by an Italian Formula One car voiced by John Turturro (who's hilarious). Naturally, Lightning must take along his bestest best friend, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who's - shall we say - not as world wise as McQueen or the rest of his crew. Hilarity ensues.To add to the tension, all of the racers are required to use a new alternative fuel invented by eco-awesome-dude Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), but when a few cars mysteriously explode during the first leg of the race, in Tokyo, people start to wonder if the fuel is indeed safe. Of course it is - because the real culprit - as we learn right away! - is employing electromagnetic pulses to disable the vehicles in the hopes that people will blame the fuel, which will bring them back to good ol' yummy oil. But tipped off to this subterfuge is British agent Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) who, along with his new-to-the-field sidekick Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), is out to stop whoever's behind all of this - and that, my friends, is where Mater comes in.This isn't really a Lightning McQueen movie; he's more of a supporting character, as Mater is unwittingly pulled into the espionage business by the Brits, who mistake him for a fellow agent (those English are so gullible!). But because of Mater's inelegance and lack of focus, McQueen winds up losing that first race, a result for which he blames a crestfallen Mater. There's your friendship conflict, always a reliable trope in animation.The race then shifts to Milan and then London, with Tuturro's Bernoulli and Wilson's McQueen trading many a barb and insult (with Bernoulli usually winning). This allows the animators to mix in some awesome scenery from both countries, and you'll swear it's filmed rather than animated. Absolutely spell binding.The two plots, the spy angle and the brotherly friendship deal, dovetail nicely by movie's end, but not before we're honestly treated to some spectacular stunt driving (ahem) - off roofs, down parking garages, and so on. It's like parkour for cars, which most of us would call driving but the cars here probably call walking and climbing.I saw this movie not only in 3D but also in IMAX. I've said harsh things about 3D, and IMAX costs even more per movie. It's all worth it here. The colors are vibrant, and when something SHOULD leap out at you, it does, and it looks really, really good. The sound is shattering; your seat will rumble. It's a visual orgy.",10,5,8,26 June 2011
Amadeus," I mean, it's not *that* dull, but... it's not that amazing, either.
","The long (nearly 3 hours) biopic is good, even very good, but it'd be nothing if not for F. Murray Abraham's amazing performance, just extraordinary. He's worth your time, even if Tom Hulce turns out not to be your cup of tea. F. is so good that even those who don't dig classical music will get into the groove; he's that passionate. The movie's also artfully framed by Forman, with some exquisite cinematography and, of course, compelling music.",6,2,3,26 February 2019
Kick-Ass," Tarantino homage kicks out the violence jams
","Although exceptionally – perhaps even abhorrently, depending on your view – violent and wildly profane, Kick-Ass is terrific, a pulse-quickening superhero movie that somehow manages to have a subtle message about staying true to yourself, or something.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is just another anonymous geek in high school when he comes up with the idea of becoming a superhero. Not one with, you know, super powers or anything, just one with a mask and good intentions. Dave buys a wetsuit and costumes himself as the eponymous hero – and quickly finds himself on the wrong end of a knife. But that's okay, too, because the resulting surgeries implant metal in his body. You know, like Wolverine. Soon, he's back and, uh, kicking ass, and his exploits are all over YouTube.At the same time, a mob boss named D'Amico (Mark Strong) is running all sorts of deals all over the city: weapons, drugs, graft, murder, and so on. Then eight of his guys are knocked out by a costumed man, and D'Amico – with the help of his sniveling son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) – decides Kick-Ass is his man, since he's basically the only costumed hero anyone knows about. Soon D'Amico and his well-armed minions are after poor, hapless Dave. Turns out that the costumed man trying to take down D'Amico is Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), who, with his deceptively adorable daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), has been targeting D'Amico's operations in a sort of revenge game.There are a few wonderful themes being developed in this film. One is that ordinary guys can do extraordinary things. Another is that the geek can get the girl, as long as he's honest. A third is that even well-prepared heroes bleed from time to time. Kick-Ass is part Spider-Man and part Quentin Tarantino's World of Comic-Book Heroes. Now, it's true that these themes may not be all that unique, particularly to movies, but the essential take-away point is that the heroes here are infused with no small amount of humanity. They are in no way, shape, or form perfect people; they simply are.Dave Lizewski doesn't suddenly become awesome when he wears his Kick-Ass costume; he's a great person, daring to stand up for the little guy. When he sees the level of training that Hit Girl and Big Daddy have achieved, he knows he's in over his head. But the experience gives him the confidence to connect with a previously unattainable high-school hottie, Katie. Echoes of Spider-Man, sure, but somehow Johnson is a little more believable than Tobey Maguire.The violence is pretty visceral – bad guys are mowed down in cold-blooded fashion by ostensibly good guys – but what might really grab you is the incredibly adult performance by Moretz. She's 13, by the way, and she looks like she's 11, but here she talks like she's a grizzled pirate. Moretz uses all of the Carlin dirty words and some more you might not have heard of. It's a little off-putting to hear such a tiny little squirt use such language, especially while engaging in bloody, realistic combat, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that her role is viewed with some controversy. Moretz's Hit Girl is very reminiscent of Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill Vol. 1, but her Kewpie Doll looks serve an even greater contrast to her intentions and actions.Kick-Ass is both evocative and heart warming. It's not the kind of movie you watch while cuddling with a honey, though, as its sweeter side is mostly kept in the background. But it's those sweet moments that help prevent the film from being a rudderless mess.",7,4,14,19 April 2010
Gran Torino," Angriest old man
","In his latest Oscarrific film, Clint Eastwood plays a cranky Korean War vet who seemingly hates everyone, including his dopey grown sons and his new neighbors, an Asian family. Walt Kowalski, having recently buried his wife, now lives alone in an immaculate house with his yellow Lab, alone to carry the sins of his past and to meticulously tend to his two loves, his yard and his mint-condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino.Eastwood takes great care in showing us how irascible Walt is. He constantly spits tobacco juice. He shuns the church and its eager-beaver pastor. He wants merely to be left alone, albeit with a half-grimace, half-sneer on his face at all times, as if he's just eaten something disagreeable. Yes, hardly a more cuddly, welcoming figure you'll never see.Shortly after the Lor family moves in next door, raising Walt's hackles, trouble begins; an Asian gang harasses the only man in the family, teenaged Thao, and his older sister, Su, trying to recruit the former. As an initiation rite, the gang forces Thao to steal Walt's prized car, but he fails in the process, thus angering both the gang and Walt, who catches him. But later, when the gang tries to grab Thao forcibly in front of his home, Walt chases them off with a shotgun, earning the gratitude of the neighborhood and the undying wrath of the gang. (This is the scene in the trailer where Eastwood famously tells the gangbangers to get off his lawn.) Such a display of rebellion would never sit well for a die-hard gang member, so certainly the situation escalates. I won't ruin the plot for you any further than to tell you that things do get out of hand. Armed with big guns, little guns, and a perpetual sneer, Kowalski isn't a mere carbon copy of Charles Bronson in Death Wish; he realizes his limitations (not to mention his mortality), that he's not some kind of hero in any sense - even though the rest of the neighborhood believes him to be and showers him with gifts.Eastwood is at his crunchiest and most crotchety here; it's as if he had a severe case of heartburn for two hours and didn't want to tell anyone directly. Kowalski never smiles; he grimaces and grits his teeth, but he's never happy, sort of emblematic of the character's entire life. As the local priest notes, Walt knows a lot about death (having killed men in Korea) but almost nothing about life. No, this isn't a movie about a bad man's eternal salvation, it's more about a man doing what a man's gotta do. And that includes not only saving the family from the thugs on occasion but taking Thao under his wing and teaching him how to be a man.Gran Torino is overtly racist, but it skirts the line of offensiveness through the use of hyperbole. Walt Kowalski uses every ethnic slur in the book (except, notably, the n word), sometimes to great comic effect. Even when he's insulting everyone, we don't feel he's insulting us personally, so we're not as aggrieved by his vocabulary choices. Eastwood is convincing as the seething rage machine, and he has a fine supporting cast. The movie is a little longer than one would hope (that is, it ended a bit longer than I thought it should), but it's an effective and highly evocative story of a man's quest for inner peace.",7,0,3,24 January 2009
Shrek the Third," An ogre by any other name smells just as sweet
","The most impressive thing about the third Shrek movie is that it doesn't stink. It is, after all, not only a sequel but also the third in a series that prides itself in its clever wit and relevance. I was hoping that Shrek the Third would be close to the first two, but I didn't honestly think it would have enough juice to really slay me in my seat. Er, metaphorically speaking.But Shrek 3 IS fun. It's been three years since the second one, and Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz have lower Q ratings nowadays. Were kids going to swarm the theater for the further adventures of the giant green ogre, or was the series played out? You'd assume the latter, given kids' attention spans and the fact that there's other kid-oriented stuff coming out.Had I disliked the movie, I could have called the movie 'Dreck'; even better, if there'd been some romance between Shrek and his never-seen mom, I could call it 'Oedipus Shrek.' But geez, I liked it. Now what the heck am I supposed to say about it? How about just 'What the Shrek is going on here?' Why must they toy with me so? Shrek (Myers) is tapped to become the new king of Far, Far Away when the king (John Cleese) falls ill. But the Shrek with that, says the green blob. There's another heir, he learns, so he, Donkey (Murphy), and Puss (Antonio Banderas) set off to find Arthur, a mopey high school misfit voiced by Justin Timberlake. (Note: I knew Timberlake was in the movie, and I thought he was Arthur's voice, but Artie sounded... well, like a high school kid, maybe even younger.) Meanwhile, Shrek's absence gives good ol' Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) the chance to take over Far, Far Away and RULE! Also aiding Shrek are his pals from other fairy tales, such as the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf (perpetually in drag and possibly a victim of Stockholm Syndrome, only in reverse), and others. Princess Fiona (Diaz) mobilizes her own galpals (Snow White, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty) to help stave off Charming's army, which is made up of villains from various tales, such as Captain Hook (Ian McShane), the Wicked Witch, Cyclops, and Rumplestiltskin. It sounds like an excuse to shoehorn as many familiar names into the movie as possible, but some of the characters do seem to justify their existences. Oh, and know who else shows up? Eric Idle, voicing Merlin, who here is a half-crazed former teacher at Artie's school.There's excellent use of song, too; one screaming attack by Snow White (Amy Poehler) is accompanied by the opening yowl of Robert Plant on Led Zeppelin's legendary 'Immigrant Song'; this is followed by scorching vocals by Anne Wilson of Heart on 'Barracuda.' Sure, this stuff won't matter to the kidlets, but the adults will get a kick out of cleverly used music from their own childhood.Here's why the movie works. None of the leads overdoes things, which is pretty tough to resist when you're doing a kids' movie, I imagine. Myers can be awfully hammy, and so can Murphy. But they're so used to their characters that they didn't go over the top, instead letting the script provide the laughs. Shrek is obstinate and foolish, and Donkey is boisterous and sassy, but they play neatly off each other without making the movie all about them. The first movie was about Shrek meeting Donkey and then Fiona, and the second was about Not Fitting In with Fiona's family. This time around, everyone's saying, 'Hey, we know you know us, so let's concentrate on the story.' It's a strange and ultimately refreshing approach, and it's what keeps the franchise from going stale. (They better hope so, because the fourth movie will be out in a few years.) All in all, the movie succeeds in every way it wanted to. Shrek had me tittering and guffawing at appropriate times, always a good thing. Nothing ruins a movie like laughing at inopportune times, unless the movie's so bad it's good. Shrek the Third easy reaches the level of comedy and hijinks as it had in the first two movies, not letting up with the funny. There's just no real decline in quality here, folks; this is a movie your kids will heart if they enjoyed the first two.",8,2,7,19 May 2007
The Hurt Locker," Your teeth will rattle.
","With bone-jarring explosions and a heartfelt theme of overworked, stressed-out soldiers, The Hurt Locker is easily one of the top movies of the year. It's absolutely overflowing with tension as the selfless members of an elite bomb squad in Iraq are constantly besieged by conflict: from civilians, from unseen enemies, and among each other. Jeremy Renner, as the unit's new leader, is in particular fearless and unswerving, with a gutsy tenacity that shakes you to your core.The Bravo Company is a bomb-disposal unit operating in Baghdad, Iraq. Sgt. William James arrives to head the group after its former leader, Sgt. Thompson, is killed in action. James quickly proves to be a man who moves to the beat of a different drummer, sometimes ignoring communiques from his fellow squad members, throwing caution to the wind. A freewheeling cowboy, James appears on the surface to be all rebellious bluster, but it soon becomes evident that his cockiness masks due caution and an almost unparalleled ability to remain cool under tremendous pressure.Make no mistake about it. War movies in the past have alternately shown soldiers as gung-ho blocks of wood or somewhat-vulnerable human beings, but few have shown how cool some true leaders can be when things get hot - physically and psychologically.Picture this: a car is afire in the middle of a town square. A bomb is feared to be inside. A soldier, part of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, dons a heavy-protection suit and ambles to the fire. He extinguishes the fire with foam and then carefully opens the doors. Then methodically goes through every element of the car to find the bomb's triggering mechanism. This sound pressurized to begin with, doesn't it? Now picture that soldier surrounded by unseen assailants. There are only two other men on his team; their job is to provide cover for him, keeping their eyes and ears peeled for any suspicious activity. Could be that the young man on the neighboring rooftop isn't aiming a camera lens at the fire, he's aiming a gun. Or maybe he's signaling someone else, someone who has the actual trigger. And these aren't just people who are actual terrorists, it's also people who just plain don't want the Americans in their towns anymore.As James' methodical madness saves the day again and again, his actions have varying effects on his mates. Sgt. Sanborn is a straight-arrow soldier who respects the rules of the game (i.e., he has no time for James' shenanigans), while young Spc. Eldridge seems to take a little more of a shine to his superior. In any case, there is also a side plot of a young boy whom James befriends. Is this boy as genuine as he seems (in his cynical exploitation of soldiers' DVD needs), or is he merely a tool in someone else's shed? One of the underlying messages of the movie is that the soldiers have virtually no one they can really trust; every innocent could be a bringer of death, no matter how young and no matter how fragile.Before this movie, Kathryn Bigelow was probably best known for movies like Strange Days and Point Break. And being married to James Cameron, whose name you might recognize as well. Both of those movies were pretty solid action movies, but they owed a lot more to their stars - Ralph Fiennes and Patrick Swayze - than to their direction. But Bigelow easily trumps herself here, and possibly all of the movies to come out in 2009 (including a little picture by her ex, Cameron). The Hurt Locker is so well shot (by Barry Ackroyd) and directed that you feel as if you are mere yards away from every potential skull-shaking explosion. The movie is shot in almost a verite' style, so you feel like you're right on top of the action, something that's crucial for intense movies like this (and less so for comic-book action movies like Mission:Impossible).The Hurt Locker is simply a masterful movie, filled with compelling drama and roaring action. It's never dull, even as our soldiers employ a bit of introspection among each other. It's sentimental but not overwrought; blink and you'll miss the theme of how all this stress affects the characters mentally. Most importantly, movie is packed with such tension that you'll be sweating in the safety of your living room (or theater), barely able to breathe until Sgt. James can disarm one of the many bombs in the movie. The Hurt Locker juxtaposes brutal violence with elegant, although intermittent, bouts of humanity (and not just by the soldiers). It's utterly compelling, fascinating, and highly entertaining, and it's got a great chance to win Best Picture next month.",9,1,6,4 February 2010
Moulin Rouge!," Unhealthy pastiche of screaming debauchery
","This overstated hodge-podge of debauchery is neither fascinating nor entertaining. Like director Baz Luhrmann's earlier Romeo and Juliet, this one leans very heavily on style. And when one leans heavily on something with little substance, one falls firmly on one's face. Which is what this unfortunate movie does.It tries hard not to be dull and boring, and in doing so eschews any semblance of nuance. Everyone and everything in this movie is loud, boisterous, screaming to be heard about the maddening din. Sure, this might be 1900 Paris, but if it was, I bet they had a run on Excedrin the following morning - if there ever were following mornings. I don't doubt people were as debaucherous as this; they surely are now in some circles.
A naive young writer (Ewan Macgregor) enters the world of the artists in Paris at the turn of the 20th century and quickly falls in love with an alluring chanteuse (Nicole Kidman). That's great. A love story is fine. But sadly, Macgregor and Kidman have less romantic chemistry than a can a tuna and an angry kitty cat. Each is a respectable thespian in his or her own right, but such talent is completely overwhelmed by the roar of the madness. Kidman can be very effective in much quieter roles, such as Dead Calm, Malice, and To Die For, but really most anyone could have played this particular role (provided they were tall and had 7-foot legs). Macgregor's been in some good films, both small (Trainspotting) and large (Star Wars Episode 1). Both would have been much better off passing up on this junk.The original was an inspired musical featuring some fine tunes. This one is a mish mash of pop hits from the 1970s to the present, often sung at inopportune, inexplicable times (and sometimes not even in the song's entirety). There's plenty of visual goings-on, however, for the viewer to forget the music sucks. Admittedly, the cinematography is superb, eliciting images upon images; there really is some magician behind the camera for this one. But rather than being a masterpiece in and of itself, the camera artwork merely overwhelms everything else about the movie. If I wanted to do nothing but see compelling images, I'd go to an art house and gaze at Monet for a few hours. Or, in the case of this flop, Peter Max or perhaps early Andy Warhol.",3,0,1,16 January 2002
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not dull, but way too convoluted and busy
","The latest in the ever-growing X-Men franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse (2016, **) is generally okay. There are several problems with it that will be noticed by even someone who's just vaguely familiar with the characters. There are too many story lines and too many characters. There are plot holes. The plot is also staggeringly familiar. Continuity with the earlier films is almost nonexistent.It's all about the first (apparently) mutant, En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac). We meet up with him in ancient Egypt as he's somehow transferring his consciousness into a new body, seeing as how his current one's decrepit. Then there's a rebellion, the transference doesn't quite take, and everyone's buried under rock and sand for centuries. Until the present, when an undercover CIA agent (don't ask) wanders to a subterranean lair in Cairo but doesn't cover up the entrance with a carpet, thus allowing the sun to come in and revive En Sabah Nur, who then proceeds to kill people with his mind and recruit mutants.Meanwhile! In eastern Europe, Magneto, I mean Eric Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is living the simple life as a factory worker with a doting wife and a little girl, which certainly means bad things will happen, as they do. (This is set after he tried to kill the president but was stopped by Mystique.) Short story long, Magneto flips the heck out, has a crisis of conscience, kills people, and flees. But not before shouting, 'What do you want from me?' to the heavens. He's recruited by En Sabah Nur (who, by the way, is the Apocalypse of the title). En Sabah Nur's plan is to destroy Earth and build a new society, in other words the same as countless other villains.And because En Sabah Nur is such a strong mutant, he's able to get into the mind of one Charles Xavier – manipulate him, in fact. Which allows En Sabah Nur to find all the mutants he needs, and which also gives director Bryan Singer a chance to bring out a plethora of X-characters, like Storm, Psylocke, Cyclops, Beast, Angel, Havoc, Mystique (of course), and Jean Grey. Most of these characters were in earlier X-Men movies, but now they're all different ages. I don't mean different just from the other movies, I mean different relative to each other. Like in an earlier movie, two characters might be about the same age, and here they're suddenly a generation or so apart.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't dull, but it's way too convoluted for the franchise. It's almost as if no one thought there'd be any more of these films after this one, so they had to cram everyone in. The result – too many characters; a winding, tortuous plot; story lines with no real resolution; and general incoherence. It's a kitchen sink approach that just never works. Some actors fare well, such as Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Evan Peters as Quicksilver (who, incidentally, has the best scene in the movie, hands down). Some mail it in, like McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique). Some try their best, like Isaac and Fassbender. And some seem ill-equipped and over their heads, like Sophie Turner, who plays the indomitable (but young) Jean Grey. Turner is really wooden.",7,7,11,15 June 2016
The Illusionist," Could be an illusion, but I might as well try ...
","When the young magician Eisenheim attempts to run away with his true love, the princess Sophie, the imposing wall of class divisions rises between them, and the star-cross'd lovers are separated. Years later, Eisenheim (Edward Norton) has risen to be the most popular - and mysterious - illusionist in Vienna, and Sophie (Jessica Biel) is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a tyrant-in-training who has designs on his father's throne as Emperor.Leopold grows increasingly uneasy about Eisenheim, whose relationship to Sophie is unknown to the Crown Prince, believing that the magician is committing fraud or claiming to possess supernatural powers. What truly irks the prince, though, is that Eisenheim manages to upstage him at the Prince's own castle with a magical display that enchants his audience of the social elite. And so Leopold orders Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to investigate the illusionist closely to determine his secrets.Eisenheim performs some truly astounding tricks, including growing an orange tree before the unbelieving eyes of the audience and transporting a handkerchief from a closed box in the audience to the claws of small doves on the stage. But after a truly unfortunate turn of events, his show becomes quite minimalist in scope: The Illusionist merely sits on the stage and conjures - yes, conjures - speaking, reacting ghosts to wow and astound the audience, while Eisenheim mopes about distractedly. What has happened to put him in this state cannot be explained here, unfortunately. But when Eisenheim's performances go a little too far for the Crown Prince's liking, Leopold orders Uhl to arrest the magician.But this is no mere telling of unrequited love followed by the mysteries of a magician. The placid Eisenheim desperately misses his long-lost love, and when he sees her in the company of the overbearing boor Prince Leopold, he uses all of the magic at his disposal to free the beautiful Sophie from the Crown Prince. How this is ultimately accomplished constitutes the great twist in The Illusionist.Norton is simply - to use a pun shamefully - spellbinding as Eisenheim, a man who uses a paucity of words, every motion calculated well in advance, every emotion kept in check, doled out in spring-loaded moments of unbridled passion. Eisenstein, in the capable hands of Norton, is a romantic, a cipher, an unknowable hero. It's a shame the movie was released during a year in which many other wonderful performances evolved on the screen, because Norton - twice nominated for Academy awards - turns in a performance that rivals those of his more-lauded roles.Surprisingly, Biel is pretty good - and, of course, devastatingly sexy - as the aristocrat trapped in a loveless marriage who finally finds someone worth living for and with. Of course, there's not much to be surprised about, since I haven't seen her in much, just Ulee's Gold, when she was a kid, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Still, she's hot, and it's rare that a gorgeous actress can actually show emotional range. It's a real treat, too, to watch Giamatti, who's well cast as the intrepid inspector, a role with more than a passing acquaintance with Claude Rains' Captain Renault of Casablanca, a man not above petty bribery and graft but with his own system of morals.A lush, dark mystery, The Illusionist relies heavily on the splendid performances of its three youthful leads to weave wonderful threads of mystery, romance, and intrigue.",8,2,2,29 January 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Smash masterpiece
","At nearly three hours, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button can be a little difficult to get through, considering there are hardly any explosions and not a hobbit in sight. It’s the kind of movie you have to prepare yourself for mentally, to sort of gird yourself against the slow - and I mean slow - scenes as the norm, not the exception. But if you are willing to invest the time and to commit to the film as a whole, the experience is enriching, beautiful, touching, and fascinating, in large part because of two stellar lead performances, by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.Based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, the movie concerns the life of the title character, who was born with what’s judiciously called in the movie a reverse-aging disease; that is, he’s born with the physical characteristics of an old man, and as time passes he looks younger and younger. You can just imagine the wacky shenanigans that commence! But this isn’t a comedy. It’s a deeply affecting, layered movie about not only the aging process itself - who among us hasn’t fantasized about being younger than we are now - but also the effect we have on the people around us, even peripherally. It’s also about loss and hope and death and unfettered romance. So yeah, it’s kind of a chick flick.Oh, but what a chick flick! I have to say that even though this is the longest non-action movie I’ve ever seen, it’s very compelling. Director David Fincher - who worked with Pitt on Seven and Fight Club - had a dilemma right from the get-go: How do you tell a story when everyone knows how it ends? Sure, this isn’t based on a true-life event or anything, but the basic premise tells you everything: Man is born old, dies as a baby. So you know he eventually dies. How does the director get from A to B without seeing his audience doze off? By operating within the framework of the quirky premise itself. Everything you or I experiences in life, we experience as a linear process: A, then B, then C, and so on. Benjamin Button goes from Z to Y to X, and so on, but there are greater implications - and complications - than simply doing everything in reverse. For one thing, Benjamin has the unique problem of watching people he loves grow old and die while he gets younger. For another, he has to deal with people believing he’s an infirm old man when he’s a naive preteen.At the heart of the story, though, is the loves of Benjamin, particularly a troika of women: his adoptive mother Queenie, played by Taraji P. Henson; Elizabeth, the wife of a high-ranking Briton in Russia, played by the elegant Tilda Swinton; and Daisy, the granddaughter of one of the women residing in the old-folks home where Benjamin was raised, played by Elle Fanning as a girl and Blanchett as a grownup. Benjamin experiences all of his love in a way that none of us ever has or ever could. He looks experienced, but he’s not, and easing into adulthood as the rest of us might isn’t quite on the menu. It’d be baffling enough to do things sort of out of order, but since Benjamin has no frame of reference, he’s not sure what’s right and what’s not so right.There are many people out there who solemnly swear that Brad Pitt just plain stinks as an actor, that he basically plays the same grinning doofus in every movie. I don’t think this has been the case for a long time, perhaps back as far as Thelma and Louise, as Pitt’s taken on more and more tough, detailed roles. Don’t believe me? Check out Babel, for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar. Or Seven Years in Tibet, or Fight Club, or the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. The man isn’t just a pretty boy, and I think it’s sort of prejudicial to label him as such when he’s clearly better than that.Cate Blanchett, by positive comparison, completely nails the role of Daisy. Blanchett is an attractive woman, but she’s never been called the sexiest woman alive, or some such nonsense. Her exuberance, her dedication to her craft, and her willingness to play unglamorous roles make her arguably the greatest actress of her generation. She’s exquisitely wonderful here, playing a complex character who ages somewhat gracefully but always, always believably. Her anguish at seeing her true love look better and better while she (she feels) looks worse and worse is compounded by her dread at knowing what lies at the end of the path, for while she’ll probably die just as millions others before her have, at a ripe old age, the man who makes her heart soar will perish under the most unfamiliar of circumstances, possibly not even knowing of the grand life he’s led.The movie is told within a framework of Blanchett’s now-aged character on her death bed, during a hurricane, while her adult daughter reads from her diary - well, really, from Benjamin’s diary, ensconced inside Daisy’s. The daughter is played by Julia Ormond, who I mistook for Lolita Davidovich. I haven’t seen Ormond in anything since I think Sabrina, and she looks fantastic; the scenes between her and Blanchett were heart-rending; Fincher used silence - and the approaching storm as background - with precision to greatest effect.As for me, although the movie is long and necessarily lags in spots - there’s only one action scene, but it’s a doozy (if a tad unbelievable, even for this movie) - it’s ultimately very satisfying, delivering on its premise in creative, bold, and mesmerizing fashion. It’s not going to be for everyone, I would think, but it’s beautifully told and very well acted.",9,1,3,30 December 2008
Transformers," I don't know whya you say good Shia, I say it blows. Kinda.
","The good news is that this formulaic, high-octane action movie from Michael Bay is pretty entertaining stuff; the bad news is that it feels like it was directed by a semi-retarded spider monkey on crack. Jarring visuals, incomprehensible fight scenes, and overblown special effects are at least somewhat mitigated by appealing performances and, of course, state-of-the-art CGI.In this remake of the 1985 film that was spawned by the cheesy cartoon series, evil robots have arrived on Earth to reunite with their leader, Megatron, who came to the planet a couple of millennia ago in search of the Allspark, a box of something or other that will enable Megatron and the other Decepticons to rule the universe! Only Megatron crashed into the Arctic and froze. Well, as much as a robot can freeze; he was merely paralyzed. Meanwhile, the good-guy robots from the same planet, the Autobots, have tracked Megatron to Earth, also in search of the Allspark.Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf is an awkward teen who's trying to earn money to buy his first car. Of course, since he's awkward and somewhat smart, we know he's the hero. And we know who his enemies are, too, because they're the ones who laugh at him. They'll all be sorry! They're not too sorry when Sam's first car turns out to be a beat-up yellow Camaro, although they might be a little bedeviled when they find out the car's really an Autobot.It's up to Sam, his new galpal Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight), and the U.S. Army to somehow defeat the Decepticons, who will stop at nothing to find the Allspark, even if it means exterminating all the ant-sized humans. Luckily, Sam and company also have the Autobots on their side, and a showdown of giant robot versus giant robot is ON, brother.One puzzling problem with the movie is that the Autobots don't show up until a good half hour into the film. I guess this was to establish the all-important Sam-Mikaela relationship, which naturally will eventually blossom into something bigger. Because, of course, the dorky guy always gets the hot chick, even if he has to defeat giant robots to do it. But it's true, presenting the backstory of the characters before showing us the Autobots does add a more human aspect to the film; otherwise it would be just a big, violent robot-versus-robot extended fight sequence. Wait, it was that anyway.Michael Bay movies are not immune to clichés; they revel in them, exploiting them to complement the loud pyrotechnics. Or maybe the loud pyrotechnics are there to distract us from the inane characterizations and dopey plot. In any event, how many movies have we in which an intern/trainee/cadet is the only one, out of literally thousands of experts, to solve the problem? How many have we seen in which someone working for the forces of Good manages to sneak something secret out of an otherwise-secure facility? On the other hand, this was one movie in which the military is actually competent; where the guys with guns know what they're doing and aren't the shoot-first, ask-questions-later types? That was surprising, and amusing.And I realize this will confirm me as a cranky old man, no matter my chronological age, but what was UP with all of the loud music? Every scene was shot as if it were a crappy heavy-metal video, circa 1986. Grating guitars turned up to eleven on the volume control drowned out some dialog and a lot of sound effects, such as robots doing robotic things. Add that to the hyperactive zooming, panning, and scanning, and this is certainly not a movie that an epileptic should ever watch.Nor is it a movie that young kids should watch, in all honesty. Transformers is rated PG-13, but it's pretty violent; the only thing that's lacking is actual blood. People get blown up, smashed, crushed, and shot by robots, and it's pretty intense stuff. So be careful when bringing little Timmy to this one, unless you want to put up with a week of nightmares and nocturnal enuresis. This ain't the Transformers you grew up with.",6,3,6,8 July 2007
Men in Black II," Pass the butter for this yummy corn
","Sure, there's a Roman numeral appended to this movie, and we all know what that means. It means someone decided to eke some more cash from the first movie in a series. Which is not in itself such a nasty, horrible thing, but all to often sequels are awash in dreckery, hodge-podge, and undying crapitude.The original MIB starred Will Smith as Agent Jay and Tommy Lee Jones as Agent Kay, part of a superdupersecret organization that monitored the activities of aliens on Planet Earth. At the end of the first movie, Kay neuralizes himself, erasing all memory of his MIB adventures, choosing instead to retire from active duty and leaving Jay to handle those mean ol' aliens all on his own.As MIB II begins, Kay's now a postmaster. Yep, you read that right, a postmaster. In a small town. Wny, he's about as removed from alien adventurin' as one could get. Meanwhile, Jay is BAOC (big agent on campus) in the land of MIB, answering directly to Zed (Rip Torn).Which is all fine and dandy till some oversexed strumpet (Lara Flynn Boyle) from outta space lands on Earth (okay, so she's not really female or human, but rather takes the guise of a model in a victoria's Secret catalog) to find some special light that was supposedly left there back in the day. If she/it finds the light, the planet is doomed. So she takes MIB headquarters hostage. I mean, after all, who wouldn't? It seems like the right thing to do.Jay's the only agent left running loose, coincidentally, but it's Kay who holds the right information in his now-addled brain, info that could Save the World from Destruction. Trouble is, Kay can't remember a darn thing, being neuralized and all. He doesn't even remember being an agent.
Can Jay deneuralize Kay? Can they both save the world? Will Lara Flynn Boyle ham it up as the evil temptress, or will she try to save her career and turn in some decent work? YES! YES! NO!This is truly a popcorn movie, although I forgot to eat popcorn while watching it. It's the kind of movie where you do other things while watching the DVD. You look up every now and then, see alien guts being spilled or hear witty repartee, and then go back to what you're doing. It's not a thinking man's movie; it's more of a slouching man's movie.And that's just fine. That's what the original movie was, after all. Smith and Jones are excellent and appealing; they have great chemistry onscreen. Think Gibson and Glover in Lethal Weapon, or Dreyfuss and Estevez in Stakeout. Boyle's a good foil, but she's mostly ineffectual. After all, it's the boys' show.",6,1,2,18 December 2002
Lincoln," Splendiferous - hello, awards season.
","Can anyone truly be surprised that Lincoln, starring the gifted Daniel Day-Lewis and directed by Steven Spielberg, is an out-of-the-park, instant classic? The movie was destined for success as soon as those two signed on, and do they ever deliver. Lincoln is a powerful, provocative, timely piece of art that is so well crafted that it diverts focus, as needed, from the president to the issues at hand - the potential end to the Civil War and the potential ratification of the 13th Amendment.The movie covers the time period of December 1864 until Lincoln's death in April 1865, with attention paid in equal amounts to the aforementioned national issues and the character of the 16th president himself, a tactful, down-home man who suppresses his emotions at the expense of his health. His is the most exasperating of dilemmas: should he agree to a peaceful accord with the confederates - and thus risk losing the fight against slavery for all time - or allow the bloodiest war to continue - and thus hope that the surrender would compel the defecting states to observe an amendment to abolish slavery? Ah, but of course there's even more to consider - would said amendment even pass? As more and more young men die each day, the decision becomes burdensome, almost Sisyphusian task.In 1865, it was the Republican Party that was anti-slavery, made up mostly of Northerners, with Democrats coming from the South. In order for the amendment to pass, all of Lincoln's Republicans would need to vote for it - plus a good number of Democrats. As today, lobbyists were deployed, by the Secretary of State (David Strathairn), to convince undecided politicians to vote for the amendment if and when it was presented for a vote. Meanwhile, the confederates are requested by a Lincoln emissary to travel from Richmond to Washington to talk - but will they arrive in time? And is this what the president truly wants?One thing is for certain: the machinations within political circles has not changed all that much. Secretary Seward attempts to woo some lame- duck senators with promises of jobs in Lincoln's new administration, but there are only so many jobs to go around. As these negotiations and overtures go on, the War Secretary (Bruce McGill) orders a massive attack on the rebels. Lincoln's own son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is frustrated by his father's refusal to allow him to enlist, and First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) has tremendous mood swings and could well be mentally unstable.Standing tall above the fray is the inscrutable, yet vulnerable Lincoln himself. He sees his end and believes he can find the means to achieve it, but at what cost? See if this sounds familiar. One argument brought up by a senator against the abolition of slavery is that it would lead to Negros getting the right to vote, to be on the same ground as white folks. Topical, isn't it, with current talk about immigrants and their standing in our country. Lincoln himself puzzles over the ramifications, but he is convinced that he must first get the amendment passed and then worry about the consequences. Why? Here's a sneak-peak story. Lincoln wonders if we are born equal, if we are born for certain times or if we must fit into the times into which we are born. He even uses a Euclidean notion to prove a point, along with countless other stories with some sort of impetus behind them. This Abraham Lincoln is lawyer, teacher, thinker, philosopher, and father.Day-Lewis, as is his wont, disappears into the role. Imagine an Irishman playing an iconic American - preposterous! And yet there he is, plain as day, looking and sounding like he jumped out of the Oval Office in the 19th century. To say that his performance is terrific would be an astounding understatement. He breathes Lincoln, gradually allowing us to see various layers of the character. But we have come to expect that from Daniel Day-Lewis, haven't we? What about Sally Field, though? Let's think about this. Sally Field is 66, 20 years older than Mary Todd was in 1865; she's only 10 years older than Day-Lewis. Can we accept her as his wife and not his mother? A resounding yes. Field hits her role hard, with raw emotion and guts, toning down the First Lady's infamous histrionics. For the past couple of decades she's done a lot of television and few big-screen roles. This may change things, oh it just might. Sally Field has just proved that an actress of certain talent can play younger. She's not just a plausible Mary Todd, she's Mary Todd incarnate.Their supporting cast is filled with familiar faces, with not a slouch to be found. Hal Holbrook. James Spader. Strathairn. McGill. John Hawkes. Jackie Earle Haley. Gordon-Levitt. And a dour, bewigged Tommy Lee Jones. Spielberg doesn't mess around when it comes to casting epic masterpieces, does he?Lincoln is a hit, from beginning to tragic end, thanks to...well, everyone. It's the kind of film that makes you forget you're in a dark room with strange people. It's the kind of film that makes you think you're standing in the balcony of the Capitol, watching the proceedings. It's deliciously detailed and does not shy away from the grisly results of the wars between men.",9,2,4,1 January 2013
Children of Men," Spellbinding; good companion to V for Vendetta
","In the near future, mankind is in deep trouble. For some reason, all of the women on Earth have gone infertile. Consequently, everyone's in a state of panic, and anarchy has more or less broken out in the now-dystopian England. Illegal immigrants are swept up and deported, if they're lucky - many are instead shot down in cold blood. Things look mighty grim as the populace slowly realizes that its own extinction is imminent unless a baby can be born.A former activist, Theo (Clive Owen), is asked by a former flame, Julian (Julianne Moore) to acquire transit papers - shades of Casablanca - for a young woman who's trying to get to The Human Project, a band of rebels well outside of London. The woman, named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), is pregnant - the first pregnancy in the world in 18 years. However, the rebels don't want Kee to fall into the hands of the oppressive regime, because they're afraid Kee might be 'disappeared.' So Theo agrees to attempt to transport Kee to a safe ocean passage to The Human Project, in order to save the human race.Children of Men is an exhilarating story that simply never lets up, following Kee's journey from when she meets Theo (and is accompanied by several helpers of varying degrees of morality) through to the bittersweet, tragic ending. It's not giving anything away to note that bad things happen, and not all who support Kee's cause will live to see the end of her tale.The London in Children of Men is apparently a fair representation of the Baghdad of the real world, with disparate factions at war with each other to assume control in a largely lawless (outside of walled areas) society. People are shot without warning and with little provocation, all in the name of protecting the 'good' people. Theo, as a bureaucrat, is largely unaffected by the chaos other than minor inconveniences, but when he's accosted by Julian's cohorts (the ol' throw a sack over his head and toss him in a van bit) and sees Julian for the first time in many years, he throws his hat into the ring as well, I think partly for old times' sake (he used to protest with Julian).The unrelenting violence in the movie is often jarring, unsettling the viewer and setting one's teeth on edge. Political atmosphere aside, one desperately hopes Kee is able to succeed in her quest, partly because of the whole saving-mankind bit but also because Kee herself - and those immediately around her - is so believable and likable. She's no shrinking violet, but she's also not of the same stripe as the rebels (gritty and raging against the machine); she simply wants to have her baby safely.The entire cast is dazzling, although the overall success of the film really hinges on the growing relationship between Theo and Kee; Ashitey more than carries her weight in a tough, complex film, and Owen turns in his usual solid work. Moore is ravishing in the few scenes in which she appears, eyes alight, face glowing, you completely believe she's become this heralded leader of an insurgency. She's simply divine. As is Sir Michael Caine, in a showy (although somewhat unrecognizable) role as an aging hippie/ex-political cartoonist who's the cheery, bouncy foil to Theo's ordinarily morose, workmanlike attitude. Caine's wonderful, although seen only briefly.The best part about the movie is, really, the ending. I give nothing away by noting that the film isn't wrapped up in a neat little box, with confetti and unicorns and flowers falling from the sky. The story does have an air of hope about it, but we do not get closure. I think that's for the best; imagine if we had an ending in which Kee and Theo ran off into the sunset, her baby saved and life returning to those pre-anarchy days. Instead of cheating us with such a trite Hollywood ending, the filmmakers decided to continue with the overall maybe bad, maybe good tone, to the betterment of the movie.",9,3,7,24 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Fine until insincere final reel
","Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a gutsy bundle of spit and verve who wants more than anything in the entire known universe to be a boxing champeen. So she takes her novice skill level to Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), notable trainer of he-man boxers. Noting that Maggie's not really male, Frankie treats her with a lot of disdain and disrespect, but grudgingly - with the help of his canny janitor/man-at-arms, Scrap (Morgan Freeman) agrees to train Maggie. At least until she can find a manager. Which she never does.Swank again gets the Oscar nod (she also won for Boys Don't Cry), but this isn't her show at all - it's that of the two old codgers, Eastwood and Freeman. Freeman's excellence finally gets the level of recognition it deserves, as he won an Oscar, too, and Eastwood won for Best Director.The first three-quarters of the movie is pretty standard little-punk-against-all-the-odds fare, kind of a step or two above The Karate Kid, but along the same lines. Scrap and Frankie impart wisdom both practical and metaphysical to Maggie, who nods and flashes the largest set of teeth this side of a sabre-toothed tiger. Seriously, Hilary should look into getting those things capped or chiseled down, or something. Swank's job is to look innocent and deserving, but still appear skillful and eager to learn more. Eastwood and Freeman just need to look smart and worldly, not to mention world-weary. All succeed in these broad characterizations.The final quarter of the movie, though, takes us on a sharp left turn away from the norm. I won't give away the plot turn - it's not a twist, just a turn - but it quickly moves the tone of the movie from inspirational to sappy, from Rocky to Lifetime cable movies. As the audience, we're supposed to feel for Maggie, no matter what happens, and that almost works against things here; Maggie Fitzgerald is shown as a saint, quite frankly. Everything she does seems to be right, or at least Well Intentioned, and most people on the planet aren't quite that ethereal.Still, it's tough not to root for the little dickens. Maggie's feisty and is determined to succeed; no small feat, considering she's scrawny even after a couple years of self-training. She's motivated by having been told how much of a loser she is throughout her life (she's 31 when the movie begins); if she's unsuccessful as a fighter, she has nothing else to do, nowhere else to go. Presumably, anyway. She's waitressing, after all, and does have a job when she begins training with Frankie, so she's really not as bad off as she wants to appear.The chemistry between the toothy Swank and the toothless Eastwood should have been fantastic - Oscar winners both, of course - but for me their verbal interplay fell flat. I felt like I was watching two people do a cold reading. On the other hand, old pros Eastwood and Freeman played off each other perfectly, for dramatic and comedic effects. Their scenes together - and one gets the impression that Freeman's Scrap Iron wasn't as huge a character in the original version of the script - were flawless and highly enjoyable to watch, sort of like seeing a married couple interact.As with most athletics-related movies, Million Dollar Baby will try to manipulate you, and it's fairly successful in that arena. However, the final reel of the movie just didn't completely work for me, seeming more like a disease-of-the-week teleplay than an Academy Award-winning movie.",7,2,4,30 July 2005
Garden State," Beautiful
","Garden State is a sweet, sometimes somber tale of Andrew (Zach Braff), a struggling actor who returns to his childhood home in New Jersey to attend the funeral of his mother. Andrew is numb to everything, least of all his mother's death, owing in no small part to the constant stream of medication he's been on most of his life. While at home, he hooks up with some old friends, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), and finds a new friend, Sam (Natalie Portman).Andrew's struggle to find himself, to find out where he is, where he's going, and how to deal with what may come, is at the nexus of the story; his mother's funeral is simply a gateway to strong introspection. At 26 years old, Andrew is past the point in his life where he can count on the future to solve his problems - he has to decide in the here and now how he will handle the problems he'll encounter.A major catalyst in Andrew's journey is Sam, a young lady who appears to have at least as many psychological problems as Andrew does. Can Andrew depend on Sam to be his rock of sanity? Or is she more unstable and therefore unreliable? This is also a movie about relationships: Andrew's with Sam, Andrew's with Mark and other old friends, and Andrew's with his dad (Ian Holm). For each of his relationships, Andrew must decide to some degree whether he wishes to remain a reactor or to become a actor.There's also unfinished business between Andrew and his father, especially regarding Andrew's mother. He has not been home since being sent to boarding school nine years prior, and understandably communication between the two has been rather strained for many years. The death of Andrew's mother serves as an impetus for them to find a way to reconcile.The film has generated a lot of praise among critics, and it was nominated for a Grand Jury prize at the 2004 Sundance festival. In my opinion, the hype matches the product. Garden State is understated and powerful at the same time, a very tough trick to pull off for anyone, least of all a rookie director; Braff wrote and directed the movie as well as starred in it, and all accolades are well deserved. His Andrew is archetypal for the prodigal son, as well as for the young adult who hasn't yet grown up.Sarsgaard is aces as the dreaming and scheming, hedonistic Mark. And you have to admire someone who refuses to take money - even as a loan - instead opting for somewhat-illegal means. But through and through, he's a strong friend to Andrew.Portman still looks too young for grownup roles, even though she's now 23 years old. Still, despite her small stature, she ably pulls off what's really a complex role in Sam. Portman manages somehow to look adorable and serious at the same time; if one squints, one can see the sincerity behind her eyes.Clever, complex, and utterly charming, Garden State is a real treat, thanks to a tight script and spot-on performances. The excellent soundtrack, produced by Braff, is icing.",8,1,3,17 January 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Flawless
","Good Night, and Good Luck is a singularly gripping, powerful movie about the epic battle between a blustery, Red-obsessed senator and a resolved veteran newsman. Photographed in stark black and white and infused with a real 1950s feel, George Clooney's sharp homage to one of the greatest journalists America's ever known is utterly captivating and discomfiting.Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) was one of the biggest stars in CBS News as the host of 'Person to Person' and 'See It Now.' When he gets wind of a soldier who's been fired from the Air Force for a tenuous Communist connection, Murrow springs into action, choosing to use Senator Joseph P. McCarthy's own words and actions against him, rather than attacking the man.What Murrow did was nothing short of astonishing. This was the mid-1950s. The press genuflected to royalty (i.e., politicos) much more than exercised genuine critical analysis of it. What's more, McCarthy's fellow senators did little to prevent the man from running roughshod over the rights of those suspecting of being 'card-carrying Communists.' With no press to question him and no colleagues to rein him in, McCarthy had carte blanche to root out the evil-doin' Reds from all facets of American life.The stand that Murrow took - putting the reputations of himself, producer Fred Friendly (Clooney), and the CBS network on the line - took an incalculable amount of courage. One misstep by Murrow and his team, and his career would be over. (As it turned out, his undoing of McCarthy was also his own undoing, but that was less his fault than the fault of CBS chief William Paley.) More than fifty years have passed since Murrow won by decision over McCarthy (the senator was censured by his colleagues, which allowed him to remain in the Senate but severely diminished his influence), but the events that take place in this film resonate deeply today. Indeed, it is not unimaginable to see a politician like MCCarthy run amok in a avaricious grab for power and prestige. The passage of time, however, allows us to reflect perhaps a bit more objectively, to examine the fight for the civil rights of every man, woman, and child in the United States. How far have we come in the ensuing half-century? Who are the Murrows of today? Strathairn is nothing short of remarkable. He's not an especially large man, but he has such gravitas in this film that he seems to fill the screen even when he's merely sitting in the background. He is a man of many faces and expressions, and every one of them seems to ring perfectly true. Strathairn has knocked around Hollywood for more than a quarter century, earning scores of accolades from his peers and the media, but he's never been a leading man in a such a widely praised film. Indeed, he's the kind of actor who disappears into roles, who is a superb character actor, adding color and depth to every role he touches. He's been nominated for an Academy award at this writing, and he stands a good chance at bringing home the statuette. It's long overdue.Strathairn is ably supported by a well-picked cast, including Robert Downey Jr. in his fortieth comeback, Frank Langella as Paley, and Clooney as producer Friendly. Even more beneficial, though, is the look and feel of the movie, and the near-flawless direction by Clooney. Clooney wisely stuck to the main tet-a-tet between Murrow and McCarthy, rather than building up Murrow as a character first; indeed, there's little else in the movie besides the row with McCarthy. For one thing, we learn virtually nothing about the personal lives of Friendly and Murrow. And that omission works very well within the structure of this film.Good Night, and Good Luck is a mesmerizing glimpse at how the power of the press can be used to uphold the rights of man, and a chilling snapshot at what can happen if ego and authority go unchecked.",8,1,2,7 February 2006
Mulholland Drive," Confusing for most but the most rabid Lynch lovers
","Mulholland Drive will appeal to aficionados of David Lynch, but for those who merely like his movies - or, worse, haven't seen any of them (Elephant Man, Eraserhead, Dune, Lost Highway), it'll be a thoroughly incomprehensible mess. I suspect it's not, really, but figuring it out calls for mental powers the like of which I'll never have. The movie does more than merely blur the line between reality and fantasy, it obliterates it.For about two thirds of the film, everything sort of makes some kind of sense. It's weird enough, sure, but it seems to follow some logic. Then Something happens, and the movie goes off the rails. Intentionally, I'm sure - it's the kind of movie for which clues are very, very subtle, and it's entirely up to the viewer to piece them together. Even so, different viewers will come up with different explanations for the events in Mulholland Drive.The basic gist is this: Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), fresh off the plane from Canada, arrives in Hollywood to make her fortune as an actress, along with approximately 40,000 other ingenues each year (taken from the Great Book of Stats I've Made Up). She has it a little easier than most novices, though, in that she gets to stay in the nice apartment of her aunt, an actress who's conveniently out of town and has permitted Betty to stay. Ah, but Betty quickly discovers that she's not alone - there's a naked woman in her shower, and it turns out she's an amnesiac. The woman takes the name of Rita from a nearby movie poster, and Betty decides to help her find out who she is while keeping nosy neighbors out of the loop.Now, the viewer knows that Rita was in a car accident on the titular road in the opening scene of the movie. She was being driven in a limo, and the driver pulled the car over and pulled a gun on her. Before he can shoot, though, two drag racing cars careen around the turn, and one smashes into Rita's car, killing everyone except her. She subsequently wanders into Los Angeles itself and hides out at Betty's aunt's place.As with most Lynch movies, though, nothing is what it seems. All Rita has in her purse is a mysterious, oddly shaped blue key - and stacks of money. When she and Betty visit a diner, Rita thinks she recognizes the waitress's first name - Diane - and maybe even flashes on a full name, Diane Selwyn. Could Rita be Diane? The ladies figure out Selwyn's phone number and call it, but they get a recording. Then they visit it, but when they find the woman's apartment, they find Selwyn had switched with someone - and at THAT apartment, they find a dead body.But that's not where it gets weird. In the middle of the night, Rita wakes up with the word Silencio on her lips, and she brings Betty to a strange club with the same name. In what's been described as the most moving sequence in the film, the women watch an interesting performance - first an emcee tells them that 'There is no band' and that all is just a tape, and then a singer belts out a Spanish version of Rob Orbison's 'Crying,' which apparently has quite an effect on Rita (who cries) and Betty (who shakes). After the performance, Rita discovers she has a small blue box, and back at the apartment she opens it. And that's about when the movie goes completely nutso.What does it all mean? I do not know. Who are all of these people? I do not know. I don't know much about this movie, and I just saw the thing. I fear it's entirely beyond my comprehension, but I did find a good analysis of it online.I like mysteries. I like having to figure things out, but I don't particular enjoy movies that have a zillion possibilities, depending on how the viewer wishes to interpret things. Or, if that's how the movie's going to be, I kind of wish the clues made some sort of sense. Otherwise, it's just a cacophony of white noise - nothing makes sense, so nothing is there.",6,2,4,4 September 2006
Brave," Solid fare in the old-school Disney tradition
","Brave, Pixar's new animated film, doesn't quite match its predecessors for whimsy, emotion, and awesomeness, but it's a pretty fine movie nonetheless. It has its scary parts, like most Disney movies, but the five year old who saw the movie with me wasn't scared one bit, so you probably won't be, either. But I don't know, she's kind of tough. Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald) is the first-born princess in a mythical Scotland kingdom. Unlike most princesses, though, Merida is feisty, passionate, and more willing to shoot a bow and arrow than to be a demure little lady. Sort of the opposite of what her strict mother, Queen Elinor (voice of Emma Thompson) desires. The feud between headstrong mother and child comes to a head when the former announces there will be a huge party attended by the three other major clans, the head of each bringing along his first-born son to offer to Merida as a husband. It's tradition, of course. That tradition gets upended by Merida's unyielding will, and in her desperate defiance of her mother she encounters a witch (Julie Walters) who grants her a spell that will change Merida's destiny. Not an uncommon theme in these movies; the trouble is that the characters never seem to understand that changing a destiny doesn't mean it's changed for the better. In this case, Merida's destiny - not a spoiler here - is changed in that her mother becomes a bear. Hilarity ensues.All curses in movies, particularly in animated movies, have some kind of loophole. Here, it's that if Merida can repair a certain bond before two sunrises, she can reverse the spell; otherwise, dear old mum will be a bear forever. For a queen who hardly ever ventures outside her enormous castle, this is quite the fish-out-of-water dilemma.From an animation standpoint, Brave is elegant without being too flashy. It doesn't try to be overly realistic, with a tremendous attention to detail, like the earlier Pixar films had. Truth be told, the movie has much more of an old-time, traditionally animated Disney film than a new- wave Pixar movie. The movie is presented in 3D and in 2D, and I recommend the latter - if only because there are many dark scenes (in a forest, mostly) that will be rendered indiscernible in 3D, which vacuums light up. Some of the forest scenes are very pretty indeed, specifically those involving the appearance of the will o' the wisp, a spirit that helps Merida find that which she seeks. The movie is not without its fair share of humor, even slapstick. Merida's father, the King (voice of Billy Connolly) is a rough-and- tumble, huge, no-necked man who's just as soon drink a gallon of ale with you than break your nose. He's also missing a leg, the tale of which he never tires of telling, to the chagrin of his family. Merida also has three little brothers who, being boys, get away with anything they wish, while the poor princess must conform to strict rules of order. Ain't no fun being a princess, apparently.Brave is a modest movie by Pixar standards, but its plot is a little more enriched than those of its predecessors, with myths, legends, and oral traditions leading the way to, in some cases, more questions. Well, more questions if you're eight years old and want to know more about everyone's intentions. If you are eight years old and are reading this, congratulations - our schools has made you a learny person. In any event, the plot is simple on the surface but contains deeper layers of provocative intrigue, never a bad thing. Kids will either gloss over the details or will find them fascinating.",7,1,1,10 July 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Groot to the last drop
","Finally, I get to see Guardians of the Galaxy while it's still in theaters, and I'm glad I did. It's the story of a ragtag band of five heroes fighting against evil in the universe. The fact that one of them is a raccoon and other is a tree is immaterial, as is the fact that each of them is a criminal of little repute. Point is, they're good guys taking on the evil Ronan, a being who seeks a legendary Infinity Stone, an ancient artifact that can grant the possessor devastating powers (and often death).The Infinity Stone is held inside something called the Orb, about the size of a softball. The Stone itself is a gem on the same order as the Cosmic Cube seen in Captain America: The First Avenger. So, yes, the universe in which The Guardians exist is the same one in which Cap and the rest of the Avengers exist. Seeking the Orb is Ronan (Lee Pace), at the behest of the mighty Thanos (an uncredited Josh Brolin) so that Thanos will help eradicate the planet Xandor for him. In any event, it's a middling thief named Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), aka Star Lord, who grabs the Orb himself in a cave on an abandoned planet. Ronan's thugs, led by Korath (Djimon Hounsou), attack Quill, but the latter manages to escape in his chrome spaceship. Quill tries to sell the Orb to a broker, but when it's learned that Ronan is involved, the broker declines, which leads to Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green-skinned assassin, attacking Peter in order to retrieve the Orb, under the orders of Thanos, her adopted father. Ah, but at the same time, two bounty hunters - a riotous raccoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and a sentient tree named Groot (Vin Diesel) spot Quill, who by this time is a very, very wanted man. They, too, join the mêlée, but all four of them wind up captured and sent to a high-security prison called Kyln, which seems like a combination of 'killing' and 'kiln,' and which in any event looks like a bad place to be. And, if you're Gamora, it is, because she's Thanos' daughter, and much of the criminals in Kyln have had their planets, homes, and families destroyed by Thanos. It is also at Kyln that our quartet meets up with the fifth member of their tribe: Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), who has a personal vendetta against Ronan. Drax is huge, sort of blue, and is deeply sensitive - although he has no idea how metaphors work.Not only is the action fast paced, the dialog - perfectly delivered by a top-notch cast - is terrific and hilarious. Sure, a prevailing theme is the old chestnut about people from diverse backgrounds coming together to fight a common enemy, but think of this as a higher-tech Star Wars, except with fewer robots. There are cultural references to the 80s (when Quill was abducted, as a young boy, from Earth), too. The chemistry among all of the leads is spot on; with each taking turns at saving the lives of the others. Even the plant-like Groot, who's often described as the muscle of the operations, shows plenty of savvy and a willingness to sacrifice himself to save others. There may be a lesson there somewhere.Along with Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, and the voices of Diesel and Cooper, the supporting cast features Benicio del Toro as a collector of rare objects, Hounsou, Michael Rooker as a fellow scoundrel to Peter Quill, John C. Reilly as a Xandorian official, and Glenn Close as Nova Prime (ruler of Xandor).In the end, good things happen. It's a comic-book movie, for goodness sake, so that's not a spoiler. But it's not really the end. Guardians of the Galaxy is a huge success as a standalone movie, and it leads into not only its own sequel but also that of The Avengers. If you look closely, you can spot some remnants of other Marvel Comics, items that may (or may not) indicate who or what will be involved in future cinematic stories from the studio. Guardians of the Galaxy is certainly fit to be in the same, ahem, universe inhabited by other blockbuster superhero films, like The Avengers, Thor, and Iron Man. It's visceral entertainment.",8,1,6,16 September 2014
Shrek 2," More Shrekervescence!
","I know what you're expecting me to say. 'If you liked Shrek ...' And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.At the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. Shrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.As with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.Shrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care. Outstanding voice performances, flawless animation, and a crisp, moderately adult (but not mature, definitely not mature) script reign supreme.",9,80,95,8 November 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Let the blood flow . .
","Quentin Tarantino's fourth movie (and first in five years) is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in years. It's also the most violent.It's not just violent. It's Violent with a capital V. You could even capitalize the entire word, and you still wouldn't be scratching the surface of its violence. You thought Pulp Fiction was violent? Think again, brother. Kill Bill does for bloodletting what Jaws did for shark attacks, what Citizen Kane did for sleds, and what E.T. did for Reese's Pieces. It's so violent, it makes Night of the Living Dead look like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, even if Fred Rogers donned a ski mask and went psycho with a meat cleaver in the Land of Make Believe.I'm harping on the violence here; can you tell? I'm mentioning this because extreme violence is one of those qualities in a film that can divide the audience neatly: those that are repulsed by it, and those who are attracted to it.Uma Thurman plays a flaxen-haired assassin who's bent on avenging her near death and the murder of her unborn child by the hands of her former elite-assassin teammates. Her story is told out of chronological order, a la Pulp Fiction, but not so jarringly; the audience is helped by onscreen titles explaining what time frame we're in.Her character is one of an select group of killers that includes O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Viveca A. Fox), Budd (Michael Madsen), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah); each member goes by a nom de guerre relating to a snake. Thurman's character is Black Mamba.Her mission is simple. Find and kill each person who had left her for dead, leaving for the last their ringleader, Bill (David Carradine). Bill does not appear onscreen in this movie, but we do get to hear his voice, like Bosley on Charlie's Angels.But as with most Tarantino films, including those he's influenced, the plot sometimes takes a back seat to style. That doesn't mean there's no substance at all, but with scenes as eye-popping (literally, in one case) as these, it's easy to lose oneself in sheer awe. From the very first scene - a real shocker - to the final, set-em-up scene, you just can't peel your gaze from the machismo and panache being exhibited onscreen.The entire cast is incredible. Thurman's practically an old hand at this, having had a prominent role in Pulp Fiction; here, as the focal point of the movie - the heroine, sort of - she is more than up to the task. I saw nuances in her work here that I'd never seen before. And Lucy Liu? I must come clean and admit I've carried a torch for her for years, but this is easily her best work. Heavily layered, very finely characterized work. (She plays a part-Japanese, part-Chinese, part-American ruler of the Tokyo underworld, and she's damn good with cutlery, too.)Now, as you may have guessed, this is not a movie for children. It's also not a movie for pregnant women, people with bad backs (the sudden moves you make when you jump out of your seat might make you slip a disc or two), people with weak hearts, the elderly, and Nervous Nellies. It's for everyone else, though. Boy, is it ever for everyone else! It's a potpourri of balletic swordsmanship, a feast for the eyes (there's that word again). Forget about the violence for a minute - this movie just plain rocks. And Sonny Chiba has a big role, too! You remember Sonny from his 1970s Street Fighter kung fu movies, right? He has a great role here, as the creator of the sword Black Mamba uses against her many enemies.You'll notice the title implies this is not the last we'll see of Black Mamba, and you're right. Yes, it's a movie so big they had to split it in two, and Vol. 2 is due to be released in 2004.But unlike, say, Back to the Future II, which existed purely as a setup for Back to the Future III, this one absolutely stands on its own. And that final scene, which I mentioned earlier, packs one hell of a wallop. I didn't see it coming, although looking back it's not an illogical surprise. (You can predict almost anything in movies if you really think about the movie, but who wants to? You're supposed to experience it as it's played out, not try hard to be three steps ahead of the characters.)Tarantino's a connoisseur of genre films: caper films, blaxploitation films, martial arts films. His highly stylish touches and imaginative direction place this movie on a pedestal far higher than others of this type. Like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is in a league completely different from any other film.",9,0,1,23 October 2003
Saw II," Almost as good as the first
","A bunch of people wake up and groggily get to their feet. They're in a creepy looking room. They don't know each other. Then they're informed they have to find a way out of the house in a matter of hours, or the nerve gas they've been inhaling will strike 'em dead as a doornail. Naturally, some booby traps aim to prevent this.This follow up to the 2004 original could have lapsed into typical sequelitis and just been terribly derivative and dull. You know the drill: Kill a whole slew o' people in horrible, disgusting ways that in no way further the plot. But Saw II doesn't quite stoop that low. The horrible, disgusting killings do indeed further the plot.I am reminded of an old radio program called The Shadow. You might recognize the name, since Alec Baldwin played the titular hero in a 1994 movie. But it began in radio, and there was one episode called 'The House That Death Built.' In the episode, people were offed in creative ways by booby traps, such as a gas chamber and a series of shotguns.It's usually difficult to translate the unseen horror, like radio can, to a full-length feature film, and indeed most movies fail to do so. But Saw II does do so. You know right away these aren't characters we're meant to find appealing, or root for. No needless attention is paid to their backgrounds; all that you get on each character is all that you need to put things together. No dialog is especially wasted, and that - along with the always-fun gore - is what makes this movie work.Of course, if you don't like blood in your film, you're going to really hate this one. It's everywhere. People spurt from all sorts of orifices, plus some new ones. But things don't seem to be done with the intent to shock, another point in the movie's",7,0,1,25 February 2006
Jurassic World," Flaccid World
","The fourth Jurassic Park movie lacks the excitement and creativity of its progenitor. Although it is set some twenty years after the events of the first film, and although the similar plot centers around a theme park with live dinosaurs, there appear to have been no lessons learned. The entire movie feels as if the viewer is stranded on the island with everyone else, except that they're on the Island of Poor Decision-Making Skills and not fabled Isla Nublar.Like most people, I was pretty charged up to see the new movie, since it'd been so long since the first go-around that the special effects have become much more invigorating and realistic. As fate would have it, however, the effects looked to be about the same as they had been in 1993, and that's saying something. I even saw the movie in 3D, thinking that lifelike dinosaurs would help make good use of that technology. Nothing doing. The 3D felt almost nonexistent, and not in the sense that it melted into the background (so to speak). It felt, in fact, as if someone had forgotten to leave it on for the duration of the movie.Jurassic World is set in what's more or less the present day. The park has indeed reopened, under the stewardship of Masrani (Irrfan Khan of Life of Pi). Masrani presents himself as someone who doesn't care so much about profits as he does about people being entertained and wowed by the park's attractions. Yes, sort of reminiscent of John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough) and his grand vision for the original park. Masrani's operations manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), as the movie opens, is showing off the park to potential sponsors. You know, like the Coca-Cola Pavilion at the World's Fair. Or whoever sponsors Spaceship Earth in EPCOT Center, for those of you who have no idea what the World's Fair was.The same day that Claire meets with the sponsors, her nephews Gray and Zach arrive for some bonding time. Seems Mom and Dad decided to send the boys to the park so that they could interact with Aunt Claire, who hasn't seen them in seven years or so. The presence of the kids on the island forecasts doom from the get-go, because certainly at some point they need to be imperiled. Don't worry; they will be. Being a stereotypical hard-driven, childless woman, Claire hands the boys over to her British assistant, who promptly loses (is ditched by) them. Older brother Zach is moody and somewhat sullen, as teenage boys are wont to be, and younger brother Gray is full of both energy and dino details, much like Timmy from JP1.This time around, the big attractions aren't the T-Rexes (or their exes - ha!); they're bigger and badder. The park's new creature is called Indominus rex, which turns out to be a hybrid of a T-rex and several other animals. Don't ask which animals; it's a secret to everyone, even Claire and Masrani. At any rate, to make sure everything's good to go before the new dinos are unveiled to the public, park trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is called in to evaluate little Indommy's paddock. The paddock looks secure, all right, but wouldn't you know it, the beast appears to have departed, presumably for a place where one can swallow cows whole without having to wait for a server to show up.And with that, our plot is really set in motion. There's a dino on the loose! It's funny how this keeps happening. Only now, instead of a few people who are scoping out the park before it officially opens, there are tens of thousands of people on the island, with the park fully open for business. But there's no reason to close the park, right? Of course not! It is not revealing anything of importance to mention that the first group of guards to try to contain Indominus carry nonlethal weapons. You know, so they can stun a seven-story tall monster. This is not as effective as you might think.Jurassic World is much more action movie than sci-fi movie. Instead of human characters exhibiting human characteristics, we're presented with an relatable group of people. Pratt's Owen is a hero, a good guy who has qualms about mistreating all creatures, but he's more Rambo than Indiana Jones - or Alan Grant. I like that he's there to save us all, but the lack of development of his character, who's sort of a combination of Grant and Ian Malcolm, means the movie takes a step backward in terms of fundamentally sound, creative writing. Perhaps this is the result of four different people having a hand in the screenplay.If you're too young to have experienced Jurassic Park or just plain like dumb and loud action movies, Jurassic World should please you. Kids should like it, particularly since there's little to really scare the pants off them. There are several homages to not only the first JP but also JP II and JP III, which does place this one solidly in the same cinematic universe as those other three. But two hours of chase scenes interrupted by too many haphazardly animated, similar-looking dinosaurs fighting each other and smashing humans may grow tiresome as you await the inevitable and foregone conclusion. Not to mention the obvious setup for a fifth movie.",5,2,7,28 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Total, unflinching terror
","In Paranormal Activity, a young suburban couple is constantly terrorized by mysterious happenings during the night – loud crashes, footsteps, and more – and decides to record the events with a videocamera. Filmed on a shoestring budget, the movie is at turns terrifying, mysterious, and electrifying, and it’s probably not a movie you want to watch alone and in the dark.Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherston) have been experiencing some sort of phenomena in their new home. Apparently, though, this has been happening to Katie for years, since she was about eight years old. As the phenomena prevent the couple from having a good night’s sleep, Micah purchases a hand-held videocamera so they can try to solve their problem.They wind up getting more than they bargained for. The events worsen, and tension mounts. Neither Micah nor Katie can get much sleep, if any, and the pressure quickly begins to take its toll. They even consult a psychic, who advises them to call a demonologist (really); however, by the time they actually call the demonologist, he’s out of town – and the psychic can no longer help them.Your mileage may vary, certainly, but I found this movie to be extremely unsettling. It is not a pleasant movie to watch, even by horror-thriller standards. Some of you may know that I’ve seen a lot of movies, and some of you may also know that includes many horror-thriller movies. Often, these movies aren’t particularly well done – they don’t have a strong plot or decent actors and rely instead on effects for shock value. Paranormal Activity brings the shock and terror by following a very simple formula, one that works very often in horror films: keep most of the terror offscreen, and your audience will be frightened. It’s what you can’t see that’ll do you the most damage.In a neat, effective trick, director Oren Peli shows everything through the lens of the newly acquired videocamera, which lends quite the sense of truth and sincerity to the proceedings. So when the camera is on the nightstand, with the handy timestamp in the lower corner of the screen, we can see for ourselves what horrors await the somewhat-slumbering couple. We see what they see, which just adds to the unfettered panic. You start to believe you’re right there in the room, and that whatever is attacking Micah and Katie will come after you next.Paranormal Activity works because of its low budget and streamlined approach. If you’re not able to buy in to the whole idea of being scared – if you’re the kind of person who thinks of horror films as things to be laughed at – you won’t likely enjoy this one to its fullest. The movie has a slow 30 minutes or so at the beginning, but once things get moving, look out!",9,0,1,9 January 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Only slightly spoiled chocolate won't melt your heart
","Amazing sets and catchy tunes aside, this remake of the 1971 original suffers a bit from an intentionally effected performance by Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka but is buoyed tremendously by Freddie Highmore, playing Charlie Bucket. Whimsical and highly imaginative, Tim Burton's latest melange of creativity is wholesome without being entirely pure, although the edge of the original film (and Roald Dahl's story) is somewhat blunted.Wonka's world-famous candy factory has been closed to the public - anyone, really - for decades, although candy still emerges each morning, neatly packed and ready to ship. Then one day, Wonka himself announces he has placed Golden Tickets in five Wonka Bars distributed throughout the globe. The children who find the five tickets are thereupon invited to a Grand Tour of the mysterious factory, and one of the kids will get a Veddy Special Prize at the end.The kids are the same as in the first film: snotty spoiled brat Veruca Salt, overachiever Violet Beauregarde, glutton Augustus Gloop, hostile Mike Teavee, and waiflike Charlie Bucket. Throughout the tour, each exposes his or her own self as a greedy, conniving fiend - except, of course, for poor (literally) Charlie, who's accompanied by his superold grandpa (David Kelly, who's fantastic).The sets are stunning, from the chocolate river to the squirrels' QC lab, and this allows one to forget how annoying Depp's Wonka is. He's intentionally unique, which is sort of a euphemism for 'we want him to be as strange as possible, the better to distance him from the people from the outside world.' Some have said that Depp was consciously aping Michael Jackson in his mannerisms, but I don't really see it. Heck, his Wonka doesn't even like kids, and he detests any kind of familial arrangement. I admire Depp for trying to make the role his own (and thus differentiating his work from that of Gene Wilder), but his Wonka was a little too loopy for me - it was tough to get a handle on him. And when you did think you knew what he was about, he'd say something that disproved that; sometimes that seemed to be a heavyhanded approach, a way to cynically manipulate the audience. If it was supposed to keep us on our toes, it failed, because I got tired of the character's contrarian attitude.A real treat, added just for the movie, is Wonka's father, played by the estimable Christopher Lee. The senior Wonka is a dentist (of course he is) who has not seen his only son since the latter left home to become a chocolatier. Which brings up an interesting question. How come Dr. Wonka looks older when he reunites with Willy than when they're together in flashbacks... but Willy doesn't? In fact, Willy Wonka looks pretty young - Lee looks more like his grandfather. Depp still has quite the boyish look about him; he appears to be in his late twenties, possible midthirties.I also enjoyed the Oompa Loompas, played by exactly one guy - Deep Roy. Roy repeated the movements of the Oompa Loompahs hundreds of times, and then he was digitally repeated over and over again, creating the illusion that he was many instead of one. A fine, fun job.Highmore is a truly great find; he played Peter in Finding Neverland, also starring Depp. Depp recommended Highmore to Tim Burton for the role of the angelic Charlie, and it turned out to be a most excellent recommendation. Charlie is alternately sage and blissfully naive, wise beyond his few years but still innocent at heart.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't as meanspirited as its predecessor, but it does have better scenery and fine performances - even the kids, so horribly bratty in the original, are merely rotten in this one.

","From the crash-bang school of LOUDER IS BETTER comes this sequel to the latest Tom Cruise blockbuster, or the Big Movie Du Jour. Not that Tom's incapable of small films (okay, maybe he is), but making a sequel to a loud action film is about as overdone as.... well, making any sequels, frankly. And we all know how good those sequels can be, don't we? (Okay, Toy Story 2 notwithstanding.)You remember Ethan Hunt of the Impossible Missions Force, don't you? Last time we saw Ethan, he was having a bear of a time keeping his team alive - and finding out if they were on his side or not. This time around, he's asked by his boss (an unbilled Anthony Hopkins) to recruit a thief (Thandie Newton) to assist in some covert viral espionage. Ethan thinks the girl's being hired for her thiefing skills, but turns out she's the former lover of the stereotypical Megolomaniacal Bad Guy (who, of course, is a former colleague of Hunt), Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Her mission, should she choose to accept it, is to reingratiate herself with him and find out what she can about a brand-new, man-made organic virus called Chimera, after the mythological beast. Whenever an action movie tries to be authentic, it incorporates someAll flash and pomp, this movie has plotholes you could drive a souped-up Hummer through. With a ear-shattering soundtrack designed to make you forget the story's a bunch of hooey, M:I-2 deftly distracts its viewer. (It's even more riveting on DVD, where the sounds are even crisper.) Why have a plausible plot twist when three or four explosions will do? Sure, I'm nit-picking. That's what I do. Critics (professional or amateur) pick nits. You could certainly watch this movie and be suitably entertained. I guess it always irks me when a movie takes 90 minutes of plot and stretches it to 120 minutes by using music and explosions. And that's not to say that the action scenes aren't elaborately and masterfully staged.Some of the acting is really unbelievable, including Scott and even Cruise himself. It's one of those going-through-the-motions motion pictures, albeit the kind where the star is getting $20 million and relies on special effects to bail him out. Didn't these people bother to read their lines before rehearsal? Oh wait, I forgot - there's no need for Method acting when duelling motorcycles will do. And did I mention the love scenes? Who does Cruise think he is, Sean Connery? It's bad enough M:I parrots nearly all of the Bond films regarding the international locations and explosions galore, but now Hunt has to be the Casanova to end all Casanovas. Yes, I'm quite aware he's a hunk and all that, but let's remember - he's probably shorter than you. Being in front of a camera can add inches to your height as well as to your weight!You might get the impression here that I wasn't too fond of this film. Au contraire, mon frere du cinema! While it's not Shakespeare, it's also certainly not Stallone. For that, I bestow copious kudos to the filmmakers, who decided not to completely dumb it down to us. And hey, if we would rather not be distracted by a tortuous plot, so be it. So enjoy: it's solid entertainment, not too bad for a sequel.",6,0,1,14 November 2000
The Hangover Part II," Pretty lousy repeat
","The Hangover Part II is every bit as bad as you might expect a sequel to be when it simply apes what happened in the previous film. It strives to be uncreative, throwing its dim-witted, unlikeable leads into the same situations, with nearly identical jokes and shock moments. It's not even guilty-pleasure trash.This time around, it's dentist Stu (Ed Helms) who's getting married. In Thailand, of course, where his betrothed is from. Of course it's Thailand, having them get married in Kansas would be dumb. Anyway, the Wolf Pack schleps off to the Far East, with not-sane Alan (Zach Galianifikis) in tow. Oh, and the bride's teenage brother, who happens to be studying at Stanford. Because he has a pushy dad, that's why.Things go wrong just as they did in the first one in that, after enjoying a toast on the beach, the friends wake up in some hellhole, this time in Bangkok. They then spend the rest of the film figuring out where they are, where the teenager is, and how to save the wedding - again, somewhat of a repeat of the first film.Raunchy movies can be a lot of fun, but this one offers very little in terms of wit, just blustery Americanisms (such as yelling louder at someone who might not understand English). Some fun is poked at the seedy underbelly of Bangkok itself and at culture clash in general, but it's an impotent mess. There's much racing about madly as the characters dash from scene to scene. In this case, that may have helped the movie, as one didn't have time to contemplate the implausible plot too much.Let's look at some good parts. Paul Giamatti has a quick, showy role as a crime boss and does well. Mike Tyson sings and shows some personality. That's about it. The rest might make you cringe - if you had cared enough about the characters to begin with. Oh, there was one other good thing - the weakest character from the first film, Doug (Justin Bartha) is left to communicate with the other three via cell phone, wondering where they are. Smart move, because that guy was boring (he was the 'lost one' they had to find in the previous film).I suppose if you got really drunk and didn't care about anything more than a moving picture, you might find this endurable. Or maybe you could make a drinking game out of it - every time a monkey did something interesting, take a shot. Other than that, it's worthless.",3,1,3,15 June 2012
For Love of the Game," Ah, spring - when a boy's fancy turns to bad baseball movies...
","Kevin Costner has been down the baseball-movie road twice before, with Field of Dreams and Bull Durham. His latest foray, For Love of the Game, doesn't quite approach the magnitude of those two; it's kind of a mixed bag. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a 40-year-old baseball pitcher at the end of a brilliant career. His team, the Detroit Tigers, has just been sold to corporate investors, and the old owner thinks it's time for Billy to call it a career. There's only one game left in what's been a miserable season for Detroit, against the dangerous New York Yankees, who can clinch their division with a victory. Chapel's on the mound of course, making what might be his final major league appearance. While Chapel pitches his game, scenes depicting his life up to that moment - specifically his relationship with Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a magazine writer. Jane's beautiful and headstrong, but she and Billy have a love-hate relationship, since he is unable to love her more than the game of baseball. While Billy struggles on the mound, we see how their relationship develops, and the struggles he feels while pitching starkly mirror the tribulations of their relationship.   This is not an unflawed production, however. For one thing, Costner has been rumored for years to only cast women in his films who are either less-talented than he is (no mean feat!) or who are less overstated; in other words, actresses who may steal the film from him need not apply. Kelly Preston falls into the former of these two categories. There is no single scene in which Preston's Jane offers anything sincerity. I kept getting the feeling that he was acting - ok, I know, she IS acting, but it's not supposed to look like it! Preston's not terrible, but she would have looked a lot better if her male lead had been a little more commanding in his performance. The book on Costner for years has said that he's an actor who continuously underplays his roles. There isn't much expression on his face - which is getting more wrinkly by the second, it appears - has he ever heard of Retin-A? - and his emotions are about as deep as a shot glass. Maybe with a better actor, the overall affect of the movie would have been more pronounced. As it is, the movie's a little lackadasical. That said, the directing itself is masterful; Sam Raimi (known mostly for his Evil Dead movies!) shows off his talent in his most mainstream movie to date, and he is much more of an asset than Costner. So what else is wrong with it? Well, the film is manipulative to a degree - although if you allow yourself to be manipulated, I guess you're just as much to blame. I myself am proud to be manipulated! I say, 'Manipulate me, O Lords of Cinema!' Even so, I felt a creeping feeling that my emotions were being toyed with. Did I really give a damn about these characters? Not when I saw how they behaved. Also, the score was a little presumptuous and overbearing. But that's just nitpicking.",5,1,3,11 April 2000
Avengers: Age of Ultron," In which Iron Man and Hulk fight
","The second Avengers movie is one of those that just plain makes me happy. And, judging by the box office so far, it's made a lot of other people happy as well. It's a grand continuation of the adventures of familiar characters, but it's so witty, original, and exciting that it's also a terrific stand-alone film.The gang's still around, even though their former employer SHIELD is not. Captain America (Chris Evans) leads the team as they try to root out the last of the HYDRA cells. They do, and they recapture the scepter of Loki, who does not appear in this movie. This leads Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to decide to revive a dormant AI program, all in the name of peacekeeping, because those things never go wrong. It's clear that Stark would rather move on to do something other than save the world every couple of days, and so he figures the new AI, Ultron, can finally bring peace to the world. Whoopsie! Spoiler alert: It does no such thing.The really awful thing about Ultron isn't that he's super-intelligent and powerful (even more so than JARVIS, Stark's AI-servant), it's that he can pop up in any machine, anywhere, because that's just what you'd expect an evil machine to do - upload himself to the Internet and wreak some havoc.Ultron (James Spader) comes across twins who are totally not mutants at all because that would infringe on Fox's X-Men copyright - Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who's fast, and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who's good with the mind games. The bad guy plans to use the duo's loathing of Tony Stark (it's complicated) to help him rid the world of the Avengers.Meanwhile, inner conflicts begin to brew among our heroes. Is Stark truly selfish and not a team player? Can Hulk totally Hulk out without making the civilian populace terrified of him? Is Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) able to deal with her own demons long enough to establish a relationship with Banner? And is Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) good for anything? Joss Whedon once said (reportedly) that working with the Avengers characters is much more demanding than working with, say, the X-Men characters, because the latter share common problems (i.e., they're mutants). The Avengers have different problems from one another, different personalities, and different enemies. One is a god from another realm, and another is in his eighties (technically). So it's not just a matter of getting them to work together as a team against a single enemy, as the different backgrounds sometimes run counter to each other.Of all of the characters, though, I think Black Widow is the most layered. We know that Natasha has been through an awful lot, even compared with her teammates, and that's why she's more or less a closed book to them. I also think Johannsson provides an exciting, vulnerable, empowering performance. She's not just playing a superhero - she's a full-fledged character.There are some familiar faces, too - Nick Fury pops up. Sidekicks (sort of?) for I-Man and Cap also make appearances. There is much joking; hilarity often ensues. There's a new layer of levity, in fact. There's an early scene in which Cap takes out a bunch of henchmen with his shield and mutters (paraphrasing here) 'Well, that was fun.' This is followed by, off-screen, 'No, it wasn't!' Hee! Hee! With the panache of an old-time serial and the touch of the pathos of a Douglas Sirk drama, the Avengers sequel is a visionary omnibus of meshing styles and genres. I'd call it the pinnacle of comic-book movies, but we have at least two more Avengers films - plus Ant-Man, another Captain America, and on and on.",9,5,13,11 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie
","Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.",6,125,300,20 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," On par with the first four
","At a little over two hours long, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is tightly plotted, requiring at least an informal acquaintance with the first four movies. But it's also very well imagined, and what director David Yates did choose to show on the screen was more than sufficient to tell the story of Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts.At the end of the fourth movie, Harry emerged from the Triwizard tournament with news that Voldemort had returned, and that Cedric Diggory had been killed by him moments earlier. Of course, this news was met with quite a bit of skepticism by the rest of the magic world, most prominently the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet, the two places to which ordinary wizards look for solid, substantiated information. Even some at Hogwarts are dubious about Harry's claims, although not the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.Because the Minister of Magic believes Dumbledore is out for his job and because he's jealous of the relationship the great wizard has with Harry, Hogwarts soon is beleaguered by a brand-new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge, whose lesson plan seems to be to prevent students from learning how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, an act of repression that stirs Harry to begin to teach his fellow students on his own, away from the watchful eye of Umbridge, whose unctuous demeanor and oleaginous personality get her appointed as Grand Inquisitor of Hogwarts, allowing her to enact decrees of such oppressive, hate-filled magnitude that the students are more determined than ever to fight back.Meanwhile, poor Harry is having terrible visions and nightmares, as he shares some sort of psychic connection with the Dark Lord. Seems Voldemort desires something, something tangible in the Ministry of Magic - but what? Harry's burning forehead scar tells him little, but what visions he does get aren't merely prophetic - they're of things happening right at that moment.The denouement comes with a terrible, terrifying battle royale at the Ministry itself. Sadly, one of the Good Guys doesn't survive.I enjoyed a lot of things about this fifth movie: the performances of newcomers Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), Imelda Staunton (Umbridge), Helena Bonham Carter (a delightfully unhinged Bellatrix Lestrange) as well as the veterans of the series - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Ralph Fiennes, Julie Walters, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, and Michael Gambon; the jaw-dropping special effects, especially those of the ghostly thestrals, which only Luna and Harry can see, among their friends; and the wonderful Room of Requirement and Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place (Sirius' parents' home).Quite a bit of the book's plot is missing from the movie, of course, including all of the Quidditch scenes and the many scenes in which the students practice for and take their O.W.L. exams; there's also an important sequence in which Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit St. Mungo's to see Mr. Weasley and see Neville visiting his comatose mother and father - up until that point, only Harry knew about the Longbottoms' fate.About an hour after watching this movie in the theater (a week after it was released), I read the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series, making this a true Harry Potter weekend. Really, I'm about Pottered out entirely right now. Reading the book and then writing this review means I may have forgotten a few things from the movie that I wanted to mention; did I hear about such and such via the seventh book or via the fifth movie? Hmm.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is about what it should be - it's compelling, wildly entertaining, and it keeps in the spirit of the books, if not the preceding movies; the tone continues to darken as we rocket to the the finale of Harry's life at Hogwarts and as the bonds of friendship and loyalty tighten around our collective inquisitive minds.",9,0,1,22 July 2007
Into the Wild," Sensational
","Into the Wild is an alternately enthralling and wrenching portrait of a young man who ran from his problems and searched for peace and found paradise and, in turn, anguish and despair. Chris McCandless' journey is a gripping travelogue that's both a cautionary tale and a vicariously exhilarating experience; man, it looked like he had a whale of a good time, but man, did it end badly for him.First and foremost, what makes Into the Wild work so flawlessly is that even knowing the final outcome doesn't change the overall effect that movie will have on the average moviegoer. Based on McCandless' real story, the movie pulls few punches in how the protagonist is depicted; he's neither a saint nor a sinner, just an idealistic (and not naive), troubled college graduate who feels adrift from literally everything: parents, life, friends.Chris (Emile Hirsch) is a highly intelligent Emory College grad, the son of a NASA scientist (William Hurt) and an entrepreneur (Marcia Gay Harden). But unlike other privileged young citizens, Chris has no intentions of enjoying the gifts and wealth his family and connections have afforded him. Instead, he gives away his life savings of $24,000, abandons his beat-up Datsun, leaves his family behind (without telling them), and sets of on a trek around the country.Chris's travels take him literally all over the country, across the midwest (where he runs a grain harvester for Vince Vaughn), to the Rocky Mountains, to the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, even down to Mexico, winding up at his ultimate resting spot: deepest, darkest, remotest Alaska. The story is told in two timelines, one of the present (the time shortly before and after Chris discovers an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness), and one of the past, the events leading up to Chris's Magic Bus time. And the two timelines are brilliantly juxtaposed with each other by director Sean Penn, who doesn't just show us a perfectly linear chronology of how Chris came to be in an abandoned bus; he shows us the story behind the adventurer, the believer, the angel, the tactiturn rebel, the iconoclast.So what made Chris McCandeless decide to ditch everything and live off the land like some latter-day flower child? I'll explain no further than to say that his upbringing, under the commanding, demanding eyes of his overachieving, arguing parents, played a huge role - but perhaps not the only role. In short, Chris decides he simply does not wish to be part of the rat race; he does not wish to be trapped in a meaningless job working for a meaningless company doing trite, soul-destroying things. He wants to live and learn on his own. And that's where the inspirational aspect of this kicks in. He sets out to accomplish something undefined (i.e., the abstract Find Himself) and winds up absorbing more knowledge through his experiences than most people do through their lonely lives of quiet desperation.Along the way, Chris meets myriad people, and it's genuinely touching how much of an impact he has on their lives as he passes through. In particular, Catherine Keener plays an aging hippie whose love for her soul mate (Brian Dierker) has begun to fade; the mere presence of the Christ-like Chris magically changes that, for the better. (A lesser film might have had Chris and Jan sleeping together to foment complications in everyone's relationship.) Chris tells everyone he meets that his ultimate goal is to live in the Alaskan wilderness, consequences be damned; everyone tells him not to do it.The impression we're finally left with of Christopher McCandless is that of a clever, thoughtful, engaging young man who had more demons than a nightmare of Clive Barker dopplegangers. Haunted by his own harrowing childhood, he escaped as literally and figuratively as he could, living by the seat of his pants over thousands of miles of gravel, sand, and asphalt. His motives might have been a bit selfish (he never did try to contact his family, the film tells us), but his heart seemed to be in the right place otherwise. Which made his demise all the harder to bear.Hal Holbrook, playing a crusty benefactor to Chris in the Arizona desert, earned an Oscar nomination, and it's well deserved, but even stronger accolades are due to Hirsch, who underwent tremendous physical changes just to play Chris McCandless properly. And the final scene, the waning moments of Chris's life, is so vivid and packed with emotion that you almost can't bear to watch, peeking instead through crossed fingers. Hirsch is so excellent in the role that it's a travesty of some magnitude that he wasn't more widely recognized for his grueling, gutty performance. Even more so when you realize the guy later played Speed Racer and previously had been best known for being Judd Hirsch's kid.",9,3,7,25 June 2008
"Girl, Interrupted"," A slight case of overacting is only knock on meaty script
","Susanna Kaysen's recollection of her experiences in a mental hospital at the close of the 1960s is adapted into a film that is both gritty and smart, reveling in its examination of the human psyche and how we as a society define insanity.The story centers on the relationship between Susanna and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a self-described sanitarium 'lifer' who is at once bombastic, bullying, and self-absorbed. You think you have problems? The young ladies at the elite institution have all sorts of mental maladies, some seemingly harmless and some bent on destruction. Is Susanna the only sane one? Even she isn't sure - she's the only one of her graduating high school class who didn't have collegiate plans, a fact that's drummed into her by each authority figure she comes into contact with. Finally, when Susanna chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka, her parents have her committed - for a 'rest.'This film appears to pull no punches when it comes to dealing with insanity and the people directly affected by it. While none of the secondary characters is really fleshed out, it's clear the emphasis is on Susanna and how she relates to the madness surrounding her. It's a staggeringly difficult dilemma - are you insane, or are you just struggling like everyone else? There are similarities in this movie to 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and even to the comedic 'The Dream Team,' but what sets this apart from the others in this genre are the performances, particularly by Ryder. It's never easy to play someone who's handicapped, despite all appearances to the contrary, but what Ryder needed to do was convey a character who may or may not be a borderline personality, not a clear-cut case. This is a task the actress tackles with gusto. While others in the role might tend to overstate their character's plight or actions, Ryder takes the subtle approach, reining in her actions and reactions enough to allow the viewer to empathize fully with her.The flip side of that approach is displayed by Jolie, who is so far over the top with her portrayal of Lisa that the viewer never gets a chance to root for her. In the face of tragedy and suffering, Lisa laughs sarcastically and generally makes people feel worse than ever. It's obvious from the start that this is a defense mechanism, but like Jack Nicholson's character in 'The Shining,' because we never see Lisa in a favorable light - or, more importantly, in a sane one - we're never able to like her. There's hardly a likeable aspect to Lisa, who seems to become more destructive as the movie progresses (a statement on the healing power of our mental institutions? You be the judge). In other words, Jolie's character is so completely wacked out from the get-go that no one in the audience can really care about her much, only in how she affects Susanna. Only at the end of the movie do we get a glimpse of the depth of Jolie's character, but by then you might not care.",7,1,1,16 January 2000
Blood Diamond," Unimpressive, loud, unmoving
","Blood diamonds are pinkish in nature, and the term 'blood diamond' refers to the blood spilled by those who were killed during its mining or transfer from the heart of Africa to stores around the world. That much I learned from the movie of the same name, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral smuggler who teams up with a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) and an American journalist (Jennifer Connelly). I also learned that huge multinational companies control the diamond market by hoarding all the diamonds. Actually, I knew that part already.Denny Archer (DiCaprio) sells guns to rebels in Sierra Leone in exchange for diamonds, which he then turns over to a diamond cartel. Pretty nice gig, really, especially since apparently everyone in Sierra Leone is in on it except for the poor souls who have to mine the stuff. The revolutionaries rampage through villages, killing most of the citizens, including the women and children, and taking the men to work in the diamond mines. Some of the male children are taken to be 'baby killers' among the rebels. So you see, everyone has a nice job.Until the day that Solomon (Hounsou), mining in a creek for the rebels against his will, comes across a pink stone described as being about the size of a bird's egg. (It's never mentioned which bird, though.) As the rebels are being bombed by the government, Solomon buries the stone. But of course he's been spotted, and the rest of the movie is spent by everyone trying to get his or her hands on it to get out of Africa in one piece.One of those people is Archer. At first you get the impression that he's sort of a summa-cum-Indy, an adventurer who looks like he's out for himself but deep down is a right respectable bastard who'll save a pretty girl and prevent an innocent man from being stabbed. Well, he's sort of that person, in that he'll save the pretty girl (Connelly), as long as he still gets his money. Kind of a low-rent Han Solo, really, only without the cool ride. At any rate, while in jail in Sierra Leone, Archer overhears a captured rebel commander accuse the also-imprisoned Solomon of hiding a big ol' diamond. And that, apparently, is all Archer needs to know, as he gets Solomon bailed out for the sole purpose of getting him to lead Archer to the diamond.To accomplish this, Archer joins forces with Maddy (Connelly), a journalist looking for the real story of the rape of the African continent. She knows the diamond cartels are behind all the mayhem but can't print anything without anyone willing to go on the record with names and dates and other information. Of course, the swaggering Archer might be that person. Might they strike a deal? Oh, even better yet - perhaps they'll fall in love with each other, running through the jungles and plains? Leonardo DiCaprio could wear a four-foot beard and still look about sixteen years old. He can't disguise his youthfulness with a somewhat-acceptable Afrikaans accent (Archer is supposed to be from Rhodesia, aka Zimbabwe). And were we supposed to root for him or against him? In the hands of a skilled actor, ambiguous intentions can lend an air of mystery to a character, but it's a delicate chore; otherwise, you wind up not really caring if the guy's supposed to be good or bad. Such it is with Archer. I got it. He's in it for himself. Okay, I wondered, now what? Give me a reason why I should care if he dies, if all he's after is the diamond, no matter the cost of human life.On the other hand, Hounsou is exceptional as a man who's quiet life has been incontrovertibly rent asunder by the invading rebel forces, which kidnap his son and turn him against his own people, and the government itself, which quarantines all refugees with the idea that it's too tough to tell which refugees are with the rebels and which are not. Having lost nearly everything save his own dignity, Solomon does not break, but bends when he must. His urgent need is to reunite with his family and restore order to their lives. Nothing else matters; he sees his diamond as a way out of everything.Completing the troika is Connelly, who offers a somewhat distaff performance as the naive, unlikeable journo Maddy. Why would Maddy feel compelled to help Archer? Oh, that's right, he's Leonardo DiCaprio. The blunt sexual tension gets to be a bit too much at times; try to avoid screaming 'oh, just get on with it, already!' at the screen. Connelly's done much better work than here, of course. It's just that she seems so listless, almost bored at times by the proceedings, like she can't quite believe she's in this junky, pseudoaction movie.We're supposed to take away from this movie the central message that Diamonds Are Bad, at least if people died in order for them to make it to us. As soon as the movie came out, various diamond companies announced they were upstanding companies who'd never, ever do anything like this. I don't know what I should believe, because I've always sort of thought that buying shiny rocks was a dumb thing to do, anyway. But overall, the impression one gets is that this is just another dumb Hollywood message/action movie. A lot of the time, the scenes are basically people running from one explosion to another; luckily, the fine acting of Hounsou allows the audience to track what's going on rather effectively. And of course, in the end Things Are Solved, as I'm sure they are in real life.",5,3,8,23 March 2007
Puss in Boots," Zip-a-dee-do....Nah.
","I'll be frank right up front, even though that's not my name. Puss in Boots isn't a very good movie. It attempts to cling to the tattered coattails of Shrek an is just good enough to sustain interest for you and your littlest of little ones. It does have good voice acting, but the writing's kind of flat - hardly any jokes, puns, pop-cultural references, etc. - and on the whole it's just not very exciting.This is the tale (ha! pun) of how Puss (Antonio Banderas) came to be, growing up in an orphanage where his only friend was Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galiafanakis). The two spend most of their time trying to find the whereabouts of the magic beans owned, apparently, by Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), who here are bad people. The beans will grow a beanstalk that leads to a giant's castle, where the goose that lays the golden eggs lives. Sort of a mish-mash of fairy tales, but what the heck.Puss and Humpty, the little scamps, become thieves in their small border town; when a heist goes wrong, Humpty is left to, er, take the fall, and a bounty is put on Puss' head. That's where the mystique develops - the hat, the boots, the sword, the attitude. Later, as Puss is about to finally get a hold of those magic beans, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) shows up for the same score. But it's totally, okay, because she's a foxy feline, and our hero is a lady killer. As an added bonus, she's a plot contrivance.This is a movie about betrayal, revenge, an reconciliation, so it's really a movie that's about the opposite of different from other animated movies and not a small number of live-action ones. If you cared enough, you could predict each turning point in the film, but you and your kids will be better off just letting that tendency zoom right on by. You'll do yourself no favors by thinking about the plot and how uninventive it is.See, unlike the Shrek movies that spawned it, Puss in Boots has precious few references to fairy tales, which is a shame. Jack and Jill were brother and sister in the old stories, and here they're husband and wife. And bad, bad people. So why even refer to them as Jack and Jill? Then the movie has to confuse Jack of 'and Jill' fame with the Jack of 'and the Beanstalk' fame; not the same Jack. That's sort of explained by a cameo by the latter in a prison for no good reason.If you did enjoy the Shrek films - any of them - you're not likely to like this one very much. It lacks all of the charm and wit that helped make the others successful. Okay, so the third Shrek and maybe the fourth were both sort of mediocre, but each is much better than this one, which may as well have been done for television by the old Filmation studio that put out the He-Man cartoons each Saturday.",4,1,5,3 September 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Sunny and spotless!
","Try to wrap your brain around this one. Suppose you could have certain memories wiped from your brain completely? Would you even notice? In theory, the movie says, you wouldn't; in theory, you'd get on with your life as if nothing had ever happened. Ah, but that's theory, and we all happen to live in Theory's sister village of Reality. And most of the time, Reality gets her way.Joel (Jim Carrey) is a dull sort of guy. He's just broken up with a longtime live-in love. He's kind of mopey, kind of aimless, the sort to whom perhaps three-quarters of single thirtysomething males can relate. In short, he's a bit of a loser. He can't even look women in the eye, and in one insightful bit of narration wonders why he falls in love with every woman he meets. But then he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), who's really like no other woman Joel's ever seen. Heck, she's not like many women, period. Clementine clearly dances to her own drummer.But Joel and Clementine have their share of problems. He's mousy and reserved, she's wild and alcoholic. Sure, opposites attract - they also get into screaming matches. Or not, in Joel's case. At any rate, after Joel visits Clementine at work and she doesn't recognize him (!), he stumbles onto an stunning fact: Clementine has willingly had all memories of Joel erased from her mind. Whoa, hold me. This alone is enough to give me an aneurysm. After mulling it over, Joel decides to do the same. Hey, she did it first, so it's OK - right? So he undergoes the procedure. But did it work completely? If so, why does he recognize Clementine sometimes, others not? Why does he relive some of the memories? Is this live, or is this Memorex?The problem is that while Joel is undergoing the process, he decides he doesn't want to forget Clementine - not now, not ever - so he begins to hide her away in parts of his mind where the good doctor and his crew cannot reach. That's all well and good, but now those memories are altered as well, and Joel must outrace his memory erasers in order to preserve his sanity and his love for Clementine.Kudos all around for the cast. Jim Carrey can indeed act, in case some of you weren't sure. He was fantastic in The Truman Show, and he's fantastic here. You see none of the typical Carrey gawking and mugging, and you see all the tenderness and fears of a scared young man. Winslet is pretty good as Clementine, vacillating between cute vixen to unstable alkie pretty seamlessly. A good supporting cast (Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood) helps tremendously.Eternal Sunshine was cowritten by one Charlie Kaufman, who's famed for writing unique films, such as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Sure, there are flaws here and there, but the writing is so crisp and sincere and flows so easily that it's very tough to condemn any aspect of it.If I have any real complaint about the movie, it's that it was perhaps a little too long. At one hour 48 minutes, it's not a marathon, but some parts near the end did seem to drag a big. This is perhaps owing to a rather pertinent subplot involving Dunst's and Wilkinson's characters, but it's a diversion well met.",9,0,1,9 November 2004
Alice in Wonderland," Fun to look at, anyway
","In this reimagining of the Lewis Carroll stories, Alice returns to Wonderland after a ten-year absence and finds herself pegged as the savior for the mystical land, now ruled with an iron fist and bulbous head by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Tim Burton's film is, as expected, visually stunning and imaginative but suffers from a predictable plot and 3D effects that feel sort of unnecessary.Alice (newcomer Mia Wasikowska) is now 19 years old and dreams nightly of her previous journey into Wonderland, but she has no memory of the actual visit. Her mother wants Alice to be married into a rich and powerful family, and at the beginning of the movie Alice and her mother appear at a posh to-do thrown by the parents of a snotty, dumb-looking suitor, who of course pops the question to her in front of a hundred simpering guests. But our Alice isn't ready for such a commitment to such a drip, so off she runs, comically falling down a hole in pursuit of the White Rabbit.Once in Wonderland, Alice encounters several of the characters she met during her earlier visit: Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Cheshire Cat, the Blue Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Dormouse, and the March Hare. It seems that the denizens of Wonderland have been awaiting Alice's return so that she can free them from the Red Queen's tyranny, something about a mystical calendar that prophesies Alice slaying the Jabberwocky. As with most Burton films, this one is a real treat to watch. In fact, if you just turned the volume down and put your special glasses on, you'd be amazed at the jaw-dropping CGI. CGI gets a bad rap nowadays, as if it were always a short cut to actual acting. But here, I found the effects to be creative and wonderful to behold. Indeed, Bonham Carter and Depp have as much to do with their characters' personalities as the CGI does. It might be that the movie doesn't lend itself very easily to 3D, but I think it's more likely that the script wasn't tailored quite enough to that technology. For example, the 3D Journey to the Center of the Earth, for all of its problems, was able to integrate 3D into the plot somewhat seamlessly, with boulders and birds alike flying toward the audience. Burton's Alice in Wonderland doesn't do that quite enough for the 3D to be really worthwhile. On the other hand, the pure animation of the movie is reminiscent of Coraline, and that's a very favorable comparison indeed. Wonderland here isn't meant to be some beautiful, pristine land; it's a land damaged by the touch of the bitter Red Queen, and you get a real sense of ominous peril.On the plus side, the acting and voicing is really top notch. JOhnny Depp is always a lot of fun to watch, in my estimation, no matter how goofy his hair may be (and it's plenty odd here). Sure, he turns in the affected performance from time to time, like his Willy Wonka, but his Mad Hatter here is both vulnerable and heroic (something that perhaps Lewis Carroll hadn't envisioned). But Bonham Carter is absolutely stunning as the Red Queen. She manages to be both terrifying and hilarious at the same time. The Red Queen, full of vanity but desperate for acceptance, is at once the most charismatic character in the movie. Another down side is that it seems to take forever and a day for Alice to even get to Wonderland. I think Burton spends a little too much time with the so-called outside world, at both the beginning and the end of the movie. What Alice's life is like outside Wonderland should be only of minimal importance to this story, I think. What matters to us is what happens to her in Wonderland, how she will persevere, who will she meet, and at which sizes will she be? It's helpful to know that Alice is about to be married to a selfish brat, but we don't need to spend 20 minutes on her outside-world situation.A final debit is that the movie operates on two tracks: one is a fantastic voyage replete with beautiful and amazing creatures and things, and the other is a standard-issue save-the-downtrodden heroine plot thread. The latter could have been scripted by any number of minimum-wage screenwriters. It reminded me of all of those movies in which some plucky hero or heroine fights all odds (as well as a lack of strength and wits) and somehow defeats the evil menace. Alice is no Lara Croft; she's not even a Red Sonja. She's just a teenager who's not even sure if she's dreaming or not.Alice in Wonderland does have its moments, but it tries to hard to mix a great children's story with a mythology and magic and kidnapping and revenge and other dark themes. And beware if you take children to see this. Even though it's a PG-rated movie, the film does contain a bit of violence, in particular a scene in which a baddie gets an eye plucked out.",6,3,6,6 March 2010
The Mummy Returns," Step-Mummy: more bark than bite
","Set 10 years after the first film, this Mummy finds our Hero Rick (Brendan Fraser) and our Heroine Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) back to their old adventuring, excavating ways. And with them as always is Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hanna), who acts as the film's Comic Relief. But there's a newcomer: the 8-year-old son of Rick and Evelyn, Alex (Freddie Boath). The gang's brought back into more hair-raising experiences when a dig unearths a rather cool-looking chest that contains a sacred bracelet. Naturally, once the family gets back home to London, the first thing the little imp Alex wants to do is open it. And put the bracelet on. Turns out that whoever wears the bracelet is shown a series of famous pyramids, and only by going to each one in succession can he or she know what the next destination is. What's the point, you ask? Well, at the end of this whole thing our old buddy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is gonna defeat the Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson) and take the king's army and conquer the world. I know, it sounds like Steven Somers (who wrote and directed) has been reading too many comic books. But this is the kind of movie that you don't examine too closely, at least not the plot.  The point is simply that there's an adventure afoot, and it's up to Our Hero to save the day.Rick, Evelyn, Jonathan, and Alex, joined by Ardeth Bay, the protectorate from the first film, encounter a series of mind-boggling special effects, all wonderfully done on someone's computer. Hey, don't get me wrong, they look real neat, like that giant waterfall and those freaky pygmy skeletons. The problem is that they're all stolen from other movies! The waterfall is a simple ripoff of the last Mummy movie, and the skeletons look a lot like the little demons in Gremlins. One fatal mistake the movie makes is in introducing the typical Annoying Little Kid. This is what singlehandedly sunk another wonderful movie, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989) had a then-very-young Sarah Polley, and this one has the aforementioned Freddie Boath. Both actors speak with a thick Cockney accent and both have a tendency to get into mischief. But you know that all credibility is tossed kicking and screaming out the window when, in the very first scene, Rick and Evelyn bring little Alex to a spooky temple in their search for this chest, and wouldn't ya know it, they leave HIM out by the entrance. 'Stay here,' they tell him. What kind of a parent brings their kid to a place like that? Ok, ok, I know it's a movie, but there was simply no reason to have this kid in the movie. He may be a good actor, but the character was unnecessary, unwieldy, and unlikeable. He was also a bit like young Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars, only not as cool. Now Alex had a few good lines and generally acquitted himself nicely, but he was more of a liability than an asset. If anyone should have played the role of buffoon and put the bracelet on (thus incurring all sorts of supernatural wrath), it should have been Jonathan, who was a wonderful surprise from the first. But alas, as is sometimes the case with casting people, they fall in love with cute little kids. Bah!Don't make the mistake I made and overexamine the movie. I saw some really dumb things, but most of them are inconsequential. There's one I'd like to point out, however: Rick, Jonathan, Ardeth, and Alex are running from the front of the outside of their house around to the side, where their car is. They RUN around the corner, and then the next shot shows them slowing down to a slow walk. Why? So they can discuss what's happened, what they're going to do, and so forth. Never mind that Evelyn's been kidnapped. Never mind that they were all frantic not 1 second ago, and suddenly when they go around the corner, they have time to chat? Sheesh! Such stupidity! Such bad editing!This very poor man's Indiana Jones isn't terribly inventive, even in its special effects, but it still is roundly entertaining. You could do far worse for two and a half hours.",8,0,0,19 May 2001
Avatar," Incredible, inventive effects can't save this
","James Cameron's long-awaited Titanic follow-up is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development. The characters are one dimensional, both as written and as portrayed, and there's hardly anything unpredictable. The only thing this movie has going for it are its state-of-the-art effects, which are truly boggling.Sam Worthington plays Jake, a paraplegic ex-Marine who's sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium (in the running for the least creative chemical name ever). Seems there's a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that's populated by an indigenous race called the Na'vi, blue-skinned, really tall people with feline characteristics. Meanwhile, a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine (played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver) has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na'vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge. Augustine's research (funded by the same company who's mining the unobtainium) involves the use of avatars, in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock-up that looks just like a native Na'Vi, the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere. Jake gets inside the Na'vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium; during the course of his mission, he falls for the Na'vi chief's daughter, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). (Of course he does.) And as said mission drags on, Jake's perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree-loving jerk, and he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right.Is he serious? You're an alien race (humans) and have no business on this moon. Your employer's stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find, basically raping the planet. Your employer will stop at nothing to get it, as he answers to no one. You're being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit. And he thinks this might be wrong? A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition, a Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na'vi, with the approval of the head of the company, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), another patently obvious name. This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na'vi and the gung-ho ex-Marine humans, who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows, even a Star Destroyer or two. The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old-school, homemade traps of destruction.But even if the plot doesn't need to be complex, it sure ought to make sense. Here's a nonspoiler question to ponder. Jake, under the guise of his avatar, is taken in by the Na'vi, whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways. Why this is to be is not terribly clear. It's evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na'vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists; as soon as Jake tells the Na'vi that he's a warrior, they're all about teaching him. I don't quite follow the logic here; if I were the Na'vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously (to me) were not there to do me harm, why in the world would I want to teach someone who's used to using aggression and violence to solve problems? I get that the Na'vi, as a warrior race, would relate more to the soldier, but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway, let alone with one who might well do them harm.Moreover, I'm not sure what the Na'vi thought Jake was, really. He looked like them, through his avatar, but they referred to him at least once as an alien. My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan. Other clan? I'll assume that only this one clan, the Omaticaya, made its home at Hometree (yet another clumsy naming convention) and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it. But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan, why did they let him in anyway? Why did they teach him? What purpose would it serve them? And on top of that, since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by 'aliens' before, doesn't it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway? This makes my brain hurt.I think it's pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars, an epic taking place on a distant world. He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay (although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade, that's simplifying things a bit). The effects, it should be noted, are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw-dropping variety. The 3D effects were unbelievable, and I mean that in a good way. Avatar is extraordinarily shot, using 60% CGI and 40% live action, and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined. It's a remarkable film.But it's only part of a film. the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience, and when a film is emotionally uninvolving, it's lost the battle for your heart.And that's the core problem. Despite some wonderful, beautiful effects, Avatar gives us characters in whom we can't really get invested, and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance, this is a crucial, fatal flaw.",5,51,88,29 December 2009
Toy Story 2," This Toy is still in the wrapper
","When Pixar brought the original Toy Story out in 1995, many people were stunned at the quality of the movie. This was no mere theatrical release. It looked like live action, but it was all done on a computer (or, more precisely, many computers). The toys looked staggeringly real. They looked not like cartoon characters but what you might find on the floor of a kid's unkempt room. And what's more, they had more life than most characters played by real-life actors. A standard axiom of animated feature films says that the greater the original, the lesser the sequel. The higher the roman or arabic numeral after the title, the worse the quality will be. There have been sequels to Snow White, The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and others that were measurably worse than the original films. It's a pattern as old as movies themselves, and of course it applies to live-action movies as well. In general - good original = bad sequel; great original = so-so sequel.And this is where Toy Story 2 breaks the rules. Ah, those folks at Pixar (and, of course, at Disney). While the original took place largely in Andy's room, the second film wanders out into the streets of the city - and even to a toy store! All of the gang is back from the first one, including the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog. What's the plot? Woody (Tom Hanks) is swiped from Andy's front yard (he wasn't supposed to be sold, don't fret!) by a toy-store owner (Wayne Knight) looking to cash in on Woody's value as a collectible. Naturally, the other toys, led by Buzz Lightyear, launch a rescue mission. But does Woody want to be rescued? We're introduced to three new characters, the other dolls in a collectible set from a long-ago TV show. You know, kind of like Howdy Doody, only everyone was a marionette. With Woody completing the set, these toys are to be sold to a Japanese museum. Will Woody go with his new friends and live in a museum, or will he return with Buzz and company to stay with Andy?The movie introduces some wonderful, thought-provoking material. Kids will be entertained by the exploits of Woody and his friends, but they'll learn without knowing they're being taught, and that might be the most effective way for kids to learn lessons anyway. For example, Woody has a moral dilemma - go or stay - and while he resolves it diplomatically, he doesn't (or the screenwriters don't) take the easy way out. Also, our old pal Buzz seems to have matured since the last movie (!) and has his OWN dilemma to deal with. We see these toys' frailities, and it makes them so real to us. Kids see them and identify with the toys. We don't just have superheroes saving the day from evil. We have toys that might just as well be the children themselves, and you have to admire the verisimilitude of the script itself. It's a script that's racuously funny, with some references only the adults will get, and deliciously crisp - it's not a carbon-copy plot.",9,0,1,12 November 2000
Frank," Honest and offbeat
","Frank stars Domhall Gleeson as a young keyboard player who stumbles his way into an odd pop band led by the mysterious titular lead singer (Michael Fassbender) and comprised of surly, unlikeable, experimental, and talented musicians. It's certainly a different kind of movie, if only because Frank wears an oversized paper-mache costume head - at all times - but the strong cast propels what might have been an indifferent, familiar storyline.Jon (Gleeson) has an office job by day and attempts to write songs for his keyboard at night. When he witnesses a band's keyboard player attempting to drown himself in the ocean, Jon is, uh, Jonny on the spot - hired immediately as an emergency replacement by the band's manager, Don (Scoot McNairy) for a gig that night. Bear in mind that poor Jon hasn't heard one note of the band's tunes but being able to play the keys using three chords is all he needs to do, and he acquits himself well. But it ain't over, is it? Don later calls Jon up and asks him if he wants to do it again, he agrees - only to discover that the band, instead of gigging, plans to hole up in a cabin in the woods and record an album.In addition to the puzzling Frank, there's Nana (Carla Azar) on drums and Baraque (Francois Civil) on guitar. Neither seems to like Jon very much, for unknown reasons. But dwarfing them both in that arena is Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who plays synthesizer (including a theremin) and is mercurial and openly antagonistic toward Jon. Perhaps because she views him as attempting to drive a wedge between her and Frank. Perhaps because she is opposed to Frank's notion of making music people will like (and pay for) and intuits that Jon will side with Frank.No one really seems to know what makes Frank tick. He never takes the mask off. No one in the band has ever seen him without it. He takes his meals by way of a straw (seriously), and speakers and earpieces are built into the sides of his mask/head. He sleeps and showers with the thing on. Yes, it's strange, but no one aside from Jon seems to mind. That's because Frank appears to be a musical genius with a terrific voice and a penchant for writing soulful, evocative music.Gyllenhaal in particular is really excellent as the nasty, spiteful Clara. It's surely not easy to make such a despicable character work, but Gyllenhaal is more than up to the task. And her chemistry with Gleeson and, to a lesser extent, Fassbender, is laser focused. Performances like this remind you just how exceptional an actress Gyllenhaal is. Maybe someday she'll get some true recognition.Frank isn't your typical musical biopic, real or fictional, and that's one of its best assets. Given the low box office returns ($644,000 in the U.S.), I'd have to consider this one of the more under-appreciated films of 2014. It's funny, honest, and offbeat.",7,0,2,14 January 2015
Drag Me to Hell," Raimi's latest is frightening - except when Justin Long shows up
","A put-upon loan officer (Alison Lohman) denies a mortgage extension to an old woman, who subsequently puts a horrific curse on her that damns the soul to, well, hell. Sam Raimi’s horror tale is very stylish, as expected, although it lags during the quieter moments, particularly when Justin Long (as Lohman’s boyfriend) is around.Christine Brown (Lohman) is trying to get promoted to assistant bank manager by her officious boss (played by David Paymer), who favors Christine’s brown-nosing coworker Stu. One fine day, a woman (Lorna Raver) pleads with Christine for help with her mortgage; knowing her boss wouldn’t want her to grant another extension, Christine denies the woman, thus incurring her wrath. Said wrath includes a brutal attack in an underground parking garage (nothing good ever happens there in movies, you know), as well as at Christine’s house.Watching this movie demands a certain amount of disbelief suspension, more so even for your typical horror movie. At one point, the old woman puts her fist through Christine’s mouth, with no repercussions. Another time, Christine actually hurls an office supply into the woman’s eyeball. Again, no real damage. In fact, after that first physical encounter in the parking garage, both women probably should have died three or four times.As I mentioned, the movie lags whenever there’s no true horror going on, as if Raimi wasn’t quite sure what to do with all of his secondary characters. Lohman has good chemistry with Long, but that’s about the only positive: Long himself is wooden, a lightweight even by horror-movie standards, so although the two actors seem to connect, their scenes together seem flat, almost forced. And that’s not all of it, either. There’s an (understandably) awkward dinner with Long’s parents, a high-minded, upper-crust family, that doesn’t resonate as much as if ought to. You pay more attention to Long’s jerkish parents (particularly his snotty mother) than to Lohman’s curse-related issues.It’s important to note, though, that the horror scenes are unbelievably scary. The film opens with an electric scene in which a young boy is literally dragged to the bowels of hell before his parents’ eyes, all because he swiped a gypsy woman’s necklace. And every action scene thereafter is powerful, gross, stylish stuff. (In fact, for a PG-13 movie, the scenes are very intense - I think standards have changed just a tad over the past couple of decades.) Bottom line: It’s a good-looking horror movie with many genuinely terrifying moments that are offset only slightly by Justin Long’s annoying performance and character interactions that lag and seem out of place.",7,0,3,7 June 2009
The Artist," Masterful - one of the best of 2011
","What chance in the world does a movie in which virtually no words are spoken and is filmed in black in white have to succeed at winning the hearts of Academy Award voters? If any of them bother to watch The Artist, the chances should be astronomical. This is more than a work of art. It surpasses the medium and our expectations. First, let me explain about the mechanics of the movie. Like its ancestors, it is not really silent; music accompanies just about every scene. Sometimes title cards appear to indicate what a character has said, but these are employed infrequently. Even ambient noise, like a cup being placed on a table, are not heard. Each actor 'speaks' his lines, and the most basic ones are easily understood by the expressions. It's not as difficult to follow as it may sound.In The Artist, Jean Dujardin plays a silent-film actor named George Valentin (sort of a cross between Rudolf Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.). He is the star of his time and makes a good living. He's married to his frequent costar, played by Penelope Anne Miller, and he has an adorable Jack Russell terrier (a nod to the Thin Man movies). In an instance of kismet, he meets fan/aspiring actress Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), for whom he finds a job as an extra in his movie as a dancer (her name itself is probably a nod to the great Ann Miller). And meanwhile, his wife Doris is, shall we say, unhappy with George, noticing the chemistry between him and his new friend.Reminiscent of A Star Is Born, Peppy becomes popular while, with the advent of talkies, George becomes less employable. No one wants to hear people talk, he rants at his boss (John Goodman). He vows to make his own movie – silent – with his own money. It opens on the same date as Peppy's big film, and it doesn't do well.The plot is a simple rise-fall-rebirth drama. Its lack of complexity is a huge asset here, as so much must be expressed visually. And what visuals! The elegant shots from cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman evoke sympathy, stark reality, compassion, humor, and love almost effortlessly. The music is beautiful and well selected. This is a movie about movies, after all, and, much like Singin' in the Rain was about one actor's approach to the new-fangled talking pictures, The Artist shows us a different approach: George Valentin, realizing his career as he knows it cannot continue, simultaneously understands that he is not fit for the future, either. He cannot change, can he? Who, indeed, would want to hear him talk?I mentioned earlier that virtually no words are spoken. As in Mel Brooks' Silent Movie, there is some dialog near the very end of the movie. But Dujardin and Bejo are so astounding, graceful, and sparkling on screen that no sound is needed, let alone actual words. They are a remarkable couple, she with the big eyes, coquettish wink, and impish personality, and he with the debonair stare, the chiseled chin, and all the raging self confidence that a stylish leading man should have. They are perfect in this movie.I cannot stress how powerful and moving this movie is. It's a stunning achievement and wildly entertaining. It's enthralling, capturing a far- off time with impeccable, glistening accuracy. Director Michel Hanzanavicius doesn't miss a step in directing his cast – some of whom are quite seasoned. There's Goodman as the studio head and Miller as the wife, and other familiar faces show up, such as Missi Pyle, James Cromwell, Ed Lauter, and Malcolm McDowell. Hanzanavicius' movie isn't just evocative of the old 1920s films – it really seems to transport you to a theater in the early part of the 20th century. It's a lavish, loving film that is absolutely packed with emotional scenes. It is, at turns, joyous and devastating, but it is always, always a huge treat to watch. It is, most definitely, one of the very best films of 2011.",10,3,5,8 January 2012
Invictus," Inspirational
","Clint Eastwood manages to top himself with this true story of how the new president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, used the national rugby team foray into the World Cup to unite his country after years of apartheid. Eastwood’s soft touch provides a timely but not heavy-handed message about hope and change that probably won’t be lost on American audiences. The result is beautiful, exhilarating, and wholly inspirational.Mandela, played with effortless dignity by Morgan Freeman, is fresh out of prison and desperate for a way to rebuild his country, which has been torn asunder by the heinous policies of apartheid. Mandela comes to believe that the most sensible way for this to be accomplished is not by making speeches in faraway lands but to give his countrymen something they can all cheer about. His solution is to galvanize the national rugby team, which to date had not been a particularly successful club and had been given very little chance to compete on an international stage like the World Cup. Mandela pins all of his political hopes on the club’s chances; should they fail, he will appear to have behaved frivolously in paying so much attention to a sport, and the black people and the white people would be even farther apart.The odds were decidedly against the Springboks of South Africa. The team was a certified failure, so much so that the coach had just been axed. Captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) is frustrated. Times are so bad in South Africa that during the team’s matches, the white audience members cheer for South Africa – but the black audience members cheer for the opposition, because the team itself is almost entirely white, with only one black player. Indeed, after Mandela’s election as president, South African groups vote overwhelmingly to drop the traditional rugby nickname “Springboks” as a way to shed themselves of all reminders of the apartheid era. Mandela realizes that such a action would instead drive a further wedge between the two races, so he countermands the local votes and maintains the nickname and the traditional green-and-gold uniforms.Sports movies in general are expected to follow a particular formula, more so than other films. That is, if we’re met with a ragtag band of sandlot players, we expect them to somehow persevere by the end of the movie. This is one of the few genres in which such predictability is a major plus. Sports movies are meant to manipulate you shamelessly, and you’re a willing, permissive participant. Invictus certainly plucks all the heartstrings it can, but the bonus is that these events actually happened. This isn’t The Mighty Ducks beating the bad guys or Henry Rowengartner’s Cubs winning the World Series, this is a real-life rugby team gaining strength, wisdom, and inspiration from their newly elected president to triumph over steep odds.That said, this is less a movie about winning the championship and more about unification. Mandela, who had been imprisoned for 27 years, had steep odds of his own to contend with. Although democratically elected, there were still plenty of people throughout the country who really didn’t trust their new leader at all and were convinced that he would lead them all to ruin. (Sounds a little familiar, and I assume that the timing was intentional on the part of Eastwood.) Mandela had to unite everyone, beginning with his own staff, in order for the country to move forward and have a seat at the proverbial international table.Because of this grand vision, Mandela takes a personal interest in the fortunes of the rugby team, even to the point of rescheduling events so that he can watch the matches either in person or at least on television. He is careful not to intrude too much in the training and management of the team (particularly Pienaar).Now, granted, this is an American movie made for American audiences, so there are some concessions. For one thing, the rules of rugby have to be mentioned at least once (and not enough, as far as I was concerned); for another, the focus isn’t just on the political machinations and aspirations of Mandela but rather on how the team itself reacts to its new success and the attempts by its captain to inspire them to ever-greater heights. What this slight sleight of hand does is present the idea of postpartheid attitudes in the framework of an athletic event, something American audiences can always care about, no matter the sport. Excellent decision by the director, I think, because the overall message is enhanced, rather than obscured, by the experiences of the Springboks.Even with the political subtext, and even among sports movies (which themselves are usually very evocative), this is a highly emotional film. The rugby scenes are so well done, so fantastic to watch, that nonfans like me – who don’t know a thing about rugby – can’t help but let down their steely resolve and cynicism. This is a happy, optimistic movie, but it’s not a funny movie. There was hardly a dry eye in the theater today, thanks to the powerful rugby scenes, and I have to admit I haven’t teared up that much at any movie in a long, long time. Eastwood’s strong direction pushes the audience into the right direction, but we go willingly and happily. Freeman is commanding in the role he was always meant to play (Mandela himself wanted Freeman to portray him), and even Damon is excellent as the South African rugby captain. This is a true winner in all aspects of film.",10,74,96,12 December 2009
Saw," Fascinating, creepy.....
","There has been a recent surge in horror movies lately, from remakes of classics to supposedly original films. Most of these are hissably enjoyable - that is, one can think of them as flights of fancy, whimsical farces that deserve to be laughed at, not with.Saw, however, fits under a different category: movies that grab you from the get-go and never let go, relentless keeping you on edge, so much so that even after you've turned off the TV and are safe under the covers in your Happy Spot, the unease sticks with you.Two men, Lawrence (Carey Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell, who also co-wrote the story with James Wan, the director), wake up in an abandoned public bathroom. Stuff is oozing along the walls. There's a foul stench. BOth men are chained by the ankle to huge, imposing pipes. And there's a dead man in the middle of the room, laying face down in a pool of slowly drying blood. Neither man knows how he arrived in his present state. Then an unseen killer informs them that one must kill the other by 6 pm that evening - or Lawrence's family will be murdered.Lawrence and Adam figure out that they've been placed there by a notorious serial killer nicknamed Jigsaw, a psychopath who manipulates his victims into killing each other. The movie dances back and forth in flashbacks to explain what the killer's done in the past (but not, of course, what he plans to do with Lawrence and Adam), which only heightens the suspense.See, this isn't a typical serial-killer movie, wherein your garden-variety Serial Killer Dude picks a theme (Ten Commandments, Seven Deadly Sins, zodiac symbols, alphabet, what have you) and then the scriptwriters get creative with the gore. Uh-uh. Now, don't get me wrong, there's gore in this movie - so shoo the kids and make sure the dog's looking the other way - but so much of the horror is perceived, rather than presented. And that's what I love about Saw. At times, it's inventively icky, but it never dwells on the sicko aspect of the killer's machinations. What it does particularly well, I think, is that it constantly keeps you wondering what's going to happen next - but never satisfying, never letting you settle into a comfort zone. Good horror films make your skin crawl not by how many buckets of blood they can spatter across the screen but by the mere anticipation of them; what's more, the best horror films make you honestly and unequivocally believe that what's happening to the protagonists could happen to you, too.I mentioned there's been a surge in horror films, but it's more of a glut of mediocrity. Saw rises far above its brethren.",8,0,1,19 April 2005
Mama," Frightening, un-gorified
","Mama is a pretty frightening movie, even for jaded scare freaks, about possession and asylums and demons and whatnot. It's not that it's not for the faint of heart - it's only PG-13, for goodness sake - it's that the scares are as psychological as they are visual. It's very well crafted, with an atypical ending and top-notch performances by a pair of young girls. It does dabble in some horror tropes and lapses in logic, but overall it's very successful at what it tries to be - a movie that burrows into your head to make you wonder what is coming next.Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) are two very young girls whose father suddenly comes home one day and takes them away - 'Mommy's sick' - to an isolated cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, and then he's gone. Don't ask me how or why; it'll spoil things. This leaves the girls - aged three and one (!) to fend for themselves. They are found five years later, and after the quickest custody battle of all time, they are handed over to their Uncle Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his rock-band girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain, seriously). To facilitate the handover, Dr. Dreyfuss, who has been studying the girls, sets them all up in a nice new house, the better to get unfettered access to them. After all, they've been feral for five years. Young Lilly almost never walks upright. Victoria retains some memories of life before losing her mom and dad, but even she harbors some very dark secrets - after all, who's been feeding the girls all this time?Shortly into the movie, Luke is incapacitated and endures a hospital stay, while Annabel - who had been considering leaving him - is stuck with two very unorthodox sisters with a mysterious past. Maybe some nurturing is in order, but it doesn't seem to be rocker Annabel's thing. Even so, she loves Luke enough to give it a go until he can return home. That's when all hell breaks loose. You see, readers, it seems something has followed the girls from that lone cabin in the woods, something that had been protecting it, something that sees Luke and Annabel as intruders, not helpers. Something...well, something not good. Things happen in the house that prove to be very unsettling to Annabel; the girls seem to have a new, unseen playmate but remain mostly incommunicado. It's not quite Amityville Horror-level, with bleeding walls and such, but it's not a relaxing environment. Only Lilly seems at ease; Annabel knows something is up but has no idea what's in store for her, and Victoria is caught in the middle, having known a life before the abandonment.One of the treasures of this movie is in piecing together what's happened to launch all events into motion. Why did the dad take the girls away? Where is the mom? You have to listen closely to news reports - which usually feel like nothing more than background noise - to learn the truth. One side note about Chastain - she is virtually unrecognizable. Gone is the flowing red hair. She looks more like Courtney Cox in the Scream movies. She does fine with the material she has to work with, in fact a bit better.It's a dark, dark movie, Mama is. Who is Mama? Is it the girls' mother, not really dead? Is it her ghost? Is it someone else? Is it no one else - an imaginary friend created by the girls to cope with living alone? It takes the adults in the movie about as long to figure it out as it will take the average viewer, and that's a good thing. Motives are not always obvious, and research - by Dreyfuss - is undertaken. This movie manages to pull off the trick of including a scary demon/ghost/whatever without showing her too fully (as in bright light or even fully formed). There are just enough unanswered questions - too many, and it's a flawed film, and too few and it's an overly neat film. And even though we can all guess where all roads lead in a geographic sense, the ending is a solid, plausible, emotional surprise.",7,0,2,3 February 2013
Super 8," Too much JJ, not enough Steven
","Super 8 is partly about growing up and partly about aliens. J.J. Abrams directed it, and Steven Spielberg produced. I expected a sentimental but exciting coming of age tale, derived somewhat from E.T. and from movies like Stand by Me. Then I remembered that J.J. Abrams was involved.The year is 1979. A group of kids, making their own movie using a Super 8 camera, are present when a freight train crashes in their town. But the train's carrying some odd-behaving cargo, and soon the kids are swept up in an alphabet soup of conspiracy, mystery, death, unhealed emotional wounds, and love. You can see Spielberg's fingerprints on the sweet stuff, but the heavy lifting falls, unfortunately, to Abrams, who here gives us an unofficial follow-up to his last over-hyped ball of fire, Cloverfield.You see, Super 8 is really two movies. One is sort of your standard something-is-amiss-in-a-small-town-and-the-military-is-hushing-it-up plot. The other is a more subtle, gentle look at growing and departing relationships, of loves past and present. And that's sort of where the problem lies for me; although the two genres can mesh well, here one part works very well and the other is a pile of predictability.The protagonist is young Joe (Joel Courtney), best friends with Charles (Riley Griffiths). Joe's mom was killed in an accident at the local plant, an event that has had quite the effect on Joe and his relationship with his dad, the town's deputy. As you might guess, Joe's dad has grown distant with the loss of his wife, which he blames on the town drunk, leaving poor Joe sort of rudderless. That's one of the reasons he pals around with Charles and the rest of his friends, to escape.The boys are making a movie with Charles as the director, and they ask one of their classmates, Alice (Elle Fanning) to play the female lead. Charles secretly likes Alice, but it becomes clear she has an eye for modest, unassuming Joe, who does makeup and lighting. At any rate, while they are filming near an old train station, a speeding train passes them by, then derails. After the kids emerge from the wreckage relatively unscathed, they recover their film.Of course, the train wasn't carrying ordinary cargo, as the film soon proves. But what is it? This is where the influence of Cloverfield kicks in. Abrams tries hard not to show us the creature in its entirety until near the end of the movie, but that didn't make it any scarier. The shots of the alien were amateurish, sometimes ridiculously staged as if straight out of a particularly poor B movie from 1953. I know the innocence of youth was a recurring theme, but I expected to be jumping a lot more than I was. In fact, here's an example of just shoddy filmmaking: there would be this intense, suspense-inducing music playing while the camera focused on one character, then sudden silence. And then, wouldn't you know it, an attack out of nowhere. No sir, didn't see that coming! So the exciting action scenes lacked a lot, like panache, creativity, chills, and even logic. Here's another example. During the trainwreck scene, the kids flee as debris rains all around them. Not just pieces of wood but rather entire cars, huge chunks of metal, and so on. They're never hit. All this stuff flying around, and they may as well have been in the perpetual center of a giant tornado. Sure, you have to suspend your disbelief, but there were a few howler scenes in this movie that really sort of forced you to metaphorically unhinge your jaw in order to properly suspend said disbelief.The real upside to the movie, though, is the group of kids: they're a terrific, convincing lot. Luckily, we don't get stereotypical kids, like The Fat One or The Brain or The Slob, etc. Each isn't terribly defined, but they're not meant to be, and they're still memorable in their own way. They exist less as window dressing and more as a running color commentary on their various relationships.Fanning is terrific as Alice. I almost didn't recognize her; at this age, she looks like a young Martha Plimpton, and if Ms. Fanning ever reads this, I mean that as praise. In a few scenes, she's playing a girl playing an actress, and she nails it. I have to believe it's not easy pretending to be something you're not anyway, so pretending to pretend just doubles the difficulty.Spielberg's touch is evident in the way the kids relate to each other and to adults; there are no cardboard caricatures, just honest characters. We see the wonderment and guileless glee that most of us had in grade school. We see kids being kids, in awe and curious but not terrified of the world around them.Spielberg's contribution works; Abrams' doesn't. If you liked Cloverfield and its poorly edited action scenes, this will be your bag. The bad guys are obvious, the impetus for the creature's existence is clear, and it's all telegraphed well ahead of time. They must have spent a fortune in CGI, mucking up what might have been a tender growing-up story set against an alien-invasion backdrop.",7,0,3,16 June 2011
Life Is Beautiful," Mostly perfect
","As we get closer to movie #4,000, I find myself trying to see movies that – let's face it – are classics and that I have never gotten around to seeing. Many of these movies are foreign films, but that's a 'problem' I can easily get past. (Hello, subtitles!) There's no excuse for not seeing them, not now.Life Is Beautiful (1997, ****) is one of those films. The movie has Oscar written all over it, and in fact it won three (Best Actor, Best Foreign Film, Best Original Score). It was released nearly 20 years ago, so it's no longer new but not quite old enough (in my mind) to qualify as an old movie.So now I've finally watched it. What a glorious film! What a flawless film, too, from the acting to the cinematography to the terrific plot – including the subtle shift, about halfway through, from broad comedy to dark comedy with a tinge of sadness. You don't see that sort of mix often with movies that have a Holocaust theme. Oh, did I give something away? No, I did not.Here's the synopsis. Roberto Benigni plays a Jewish-Italian librarian in 1930s Italy. Guido is a fun-loving cut-up with impeccable comic timing, and it's with his quick wit and that timing that he woos and wins over a noble lass named Dora, played by Benigni's real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi. That's generally the first half of the movie, with Guido's antics providing some hilarious entertainment. The man rescues his lady with a green horse! But, you see, Guido is Jewish, and did I mention this was 1930s Italy? The Nazis are around, and Guido, Dora, and their young son Joshua are rounded up and taken to a concentration camp. Dora is immediately separated from her son and husband. Guido and Joshua are taken to some stark, ugly barracks. Guido knows perfectly well what's going on, but he desperately wants to prevent Joshua from knowing the awful truth of their predicament. So he tells the boy that everyone – the other prisoners, the guards, his mom – are part of an elaborate game. The winner gets to take home a tank! The rules include not asking for one's mommy, not crying, and not saying you're hungry.Elaborate isn't the word for it, frankly. The other prisoners play along, too. Guido's love for his son is so powerful that he refuses to let the lad lose hope, even when other children insist that the guards turn people like Joshua into soap and buttons. Guido's indomitable spirit saves Joshua.Benigni is amazing and justifiably won an Oscar for this movie. Remember him famously walking over seats to get to the stage at the Academy Awards? His outsized personality commands Life Is Beautiful, imploring us to find serenity, compassion, and love in even the most impossible places. Truly a triumphant film.",10,1,3,16 June 2016
Up," Soaring Up
","When a slight misunderstanding threatens to force elderly Carl Fredrickson (Ed Asner) into a retirement home, the wiley old coot decides to go for broke, attaching thousands of balloons to his house and floating off to the jungle wilds of South America. Trouble is, a little kid named Russell (Jordan Nagai) is also along for the ride, which doesn’t quite play out the way Carl intends it to. This Disney/Pixar instaclassic is a lot of fun, especially in 3D, with charming, realistic characters, sweeping vistas, and a straight-arrow message that’s neither muddled nor heavyhanded.Now, you gotta know this upfront: I love 3D animated films. It’s not like the old days, where the makers would try so hard to make the 3D exciting and amazing that they forgot to make a movie behind the effects. What happens nowadays is that the creators write an awesome, fun movie and then toss dollops of 3D effects to accentuate the story, rather than distract from it. (Or, as sometimes would happen, detract from it.) So maybe I was an easy mark, but I thought Up was outstanding. Ed Asner, as the cranky old man who’s lost his zest for life, turns in a pitch-perfect performance that’s both endearing and curmudgeonly. Of course, the animation is so detailed that you can count the hairs on Carl’s chin as the days progress, but the Pixar gang did a great job in showing the various expressions on the faces of the human characters here, something I think they’ve been slow to develop well. (The toys in Toy Story, for example, looked great, but Sid the neighbor kid did not appear to be fully formed.) The story itself is an adventure on the order of Indiana Jones, if Indy were a septuagenarian with the physical prowess of an eggplant. The unlikely duo winds up in South America, all right, but they encounter more than just trees and rocks. Every animated film needs a villain, and here we get the luminous Christopher Plummer as a thought-dead old-time explorer who’s been holed up at the very spot Carl wishes to visit. Plummer does evil pretty well, I think, especially for a Canadian. (They’re kindly, peaceful folk, you see.) Compared with recent 3D movies, I’d put Up a little higher up than Monsters versus Aliens, but not much. The sweet ending, although expected, packs just as strong an emotional punch as it would if you couldn’t see it coming. And certainly the intended audience for this movie won’t care about nuances; the kids in the theater where I saw this raved about it, keeping in awed silence for much of the film - except when Big Fun Wonderful Things were happening, when they erupted with raucous jubilation.",8,0,1,6 June 2009
The Hurricane," Hurricane a perfect knockout
","Denzel Washington plays Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, a welterweight boxer who was wrongly imprisoned for murder. Rubin's learned his life lessons at the proverbial school of hard knocks, mostly at the hands of racist police officers in his home town of Paterson, New Jersey. But, being the tough I-can-take-on-the-world kind of guy he is, he fights his way through the hatred and perseveres to become welterweight champ. And all is going well until one night when Carter is arrested and charged with the murders of four innocent people. With a checkered past that includes problems with white authorities, Carter is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.
Carter tries to appeal his case, but to no avail. Many people rally to his defense, including celebrities. Nothing. Sixteen years later, Hurricane is still in stir. Three Canadians decide to pick up his case:  Terry Swinton, Lisa Peters, and Sam Chaiton, who vow to free Carter.On the surface, you might dismiss this as another put-upon-man-fights-back-against-all-and-triumphs-over-bad-due-to-the-strength-of-his-heart kind of movie. And the fact that this is a true story would tend to make you think, 'Oh, well of course he triumphs, otherwise they wouldn't be making a movie out of it!' But let me warn you here: Please don't make such sweeping assumptions about this masterpiece.There are times, during the early part of this movie, during the childhood years and early adulthood years of Carter, that one gets a sense that they've seen this before. Those times are slowly erased when  the film turns from being a standard biopic to being a taut, tender courtroom drama. And if you think there's no such beast as a 'tender' courtroom drama, then friends you have not seen this movie.This is a powerful film. It first lulls you with that sense of sameness from the early Carter days then smacks you upside the head with an ending that, while predictable (it IS a true story, of course) is so emotionally charged and magnificently acted that there is simply no way you can walk away from it without feeling something. There's a lot to be said for a movie that can do all that despite being so factual and almost antiseptic. Sure, anytime the good guys win you're more apt to have a tear running down your face, but this movie seems to transcend all of that. Washington himself turns in perhaps the best performance of his entire career, and considering the accolades this man has generated in his nearly 20-year career, that's no small feat. Even with a murmur, Washington can essay such passion to raise the eyes of even the most downtrodden lost soul. He is the magnet in this film, the movie's draw, but he's not the only one performing so well. Each of the Canadians who fight for him are a real treat to watch, especially the talented Deborah Unger as Lisa Peters. Add to all of this the superb, experienced direction of Norman Jewison, and my friends, you have yourselves a masterpiece.",9,0,2,1 August 2000
From Hell," Not a hot film, not a cold one.... From Limbo
","A clarvoyant inspector works on the famed Jack the Ripper murder cases in Victorian era London. Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) can best be described as troubled, as he is haunted both by his own psychic abilities and his dependence on absinthe. As destitute prostitutes are murdered and eviscerated, disemboweled, and worse on the streets of the extremely poor Whitechapel section of the city, Abberline tries to discern the culprit - it's a learned man, he concludes, one with a distinct knowledge of medicine. Smart lad, that. As Abberline becomes more and more involved with the case, he also becomes more involved with one prostitute in particular whose group seems to have been targeted, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). From the start, one can tell that Mary and Abberline will hook up, because she is the only prostitute who does not look downtrodden and, well, like a bucket of mud. (As a point of fact, love interests never look like buckets of mud, unless the story is about a cure for looking like a bucket of mud, or something.)
At any rate, as Abberline investigates further, he runs into his ultraconservative, image-conscious boss, who even asks him to destroy evidence and suspends him (how come so few police chiefs and the like actually act in concert with their detectives and officers on the screen? How come the cop has to go beyond regulations to get at the truth?). Abberline does have the help of his colleague Peter Godley (the always-reliable Robbie Coltrane), but in general he's on his own. Can he solve the crimes?Depp attempts to disappear into the role, and for the most part he succeeds, right down to what sounds to me like an authentic Cockney accent (but what do I know?). The problem is, the story's weak, and when the lead actor's just trying to blend in, the movie comes off as rather pedestrian. In other words, folks, you've already seen this movie in one form or another. There are some twists, but they're minor ones. It's a rainy, cold, dark, dreary movie, much like I imagine London itself was back then (and perhaps still is, at times). There's simply not much unique with this movie, and it could have been just as well done with lesser-known stars. Graham, in particular, is wasted here - she's a fine actress, but she's left to do little more than be a victim.  In addition, the ending is pretty unsatisfying, although the killer is named.",5,1,2,27 May 2002
National Treasure," Good action, illogical plot
","National Treasure won't surprise you, but thanks to a rather appealing performance by Nicholas Cage and some choice location shooting, you forget that the plot is nonsensical and illogical, and all is well with the world.The appropriately named Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage) comes from a long line of wacky theorists who believe that the Founding Fathers of the United States buried a ton of treasure somewhere, and that a clue to its whereabouts is on the back of the fabled Declaration of Independence. So, with his trusty sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha) and a reluctant expert, Abigail (Diane Kruger), he sets out to steal the treasured document and discover the cache of loot for which he and his own forefathers have been searching for decades.Cage makes like Indiana Jones here, and while he's no Harrison Ford (even a younger Harrison Ford), he's a spot better than you might expect. He's never quite believable as an action hero in this movie, but he seems authentic as a man of letters, a clever conniver, a sly sleuth. Good thing, because he's pretty much the entire show here, save for the awesome footage of Genuine American Historical Monuments. Anytime you can sneak in recognizable landmarks, your film will stand apart from the others in the genre; it'll be more memorable. Check out a minor Hitchcock film, Saboteur, and you'll see excellent use of the Statue of Liberty.The movie is apparently based quite loosely on the Dan Brown novel The DaVinci Code. I haven't read the book yet, mostly because I'm too cheap to go buy it and it's always, always out on loan from my library. But I've heard from very reputable sources that National Treasure is basically a ripoff of the DaVinci Code story, albeit supercharged as an action thriller extravaganza. I bet the book didn't things blowing up all the time, but that's what you have to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer film. I'd advise you to read the book instead, for I hear it's clever and entertaining; the movie gets it only half right.,Although the logical train Gates follows from clue to clue seems somewhat implausible at times, don't let that distract you from a fun time. Don't let the clichés of a hot-but-smart female sidekick; a smooth, superrich Eurotrash villain; and a wisecracking computer-whiz male sidekick deter you, either. But wait, don't shut your brain off entirely. You want to see how many of the clues you'll understand before Gates does. In fact, make a drinking game of it. Every time he says, 'I'm working on it!' or looks exasperated, do a shot. I guarantee you'll be snockered in no time.One other minor debit is that there really isn't much chemistry between Cage and Kruger. I mean, every hero has to have The Girl, and they just don't seem to click. Maybe they didn't like each other. Maybe Cage tried to put the moves on Kruger and she slapped him silly. Whatever the reason, they just don't seem too into each other, as they're supposed to be.In all, it's not too bad, and probably best seen on a big screen, the better to see Stuff Get Blown Up.",6,1,2,12 June 2005
How to Train Your Dragon," Well-done animation
","I probably should have watched How to Train Your Dragon in 3D. As it was, on my hi-def 2D television, the effects were a real joy anyway. And, as it was, it turns out that the movie is a heck of a lot better than your average blockbuster kidflick – Pixar notwithstanding – that's terrific fun.The aptly named hero of the story, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Viking. Seriously, try to imagine Jay Baruchel as a Viking warrior, and you can't. He's basically the runt of the litter, and he's always kept indoors when his remote Scandinavian village is attacked by flying dragons. Hiccup is small but not without some courage; he often sneaks outside just long enough to cause trouble for the humans. And so it goes.One night he accidentally wounds a Night Fury, the kind of dragon that's so stealthy it's practically invisible, the kind that spits lasers out of its mouth instead of regular fire. The kind, in other words, that ends battles quickly. Hiccup, after some awkward moments, befriends the young dragon but keeps its existence a secret from the town, knowing they'd just as soon put it out of their misery.Meanwhile, young Hiccup is being trained to be a Viking along with the other of-age kids (including America Ferrara, Jonah Hill, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse), because all the manly men are out looking for the dragons' hive. Hiccup learns he has an ability to empathize with the airborne reptiles, which enables him to defeat them during his training, thus making him the toast of the town. And then, of course, his dad (Gerard Butler) returns and thinks his formerly nebbish son is now the one who will save them all.At its core, this is a movie about acceptance. The humans must accept that the dragons have a perfectly good reason for raiding them; the dragons must accept that the humans aren't so terrible after all; and Hiccup's dad must accept that his son will never be seven feet tall, weigh 400 pounds, and be able to wield several double axes at once. Everyone has his part in society, and papa Stoick comes to realize that mindless violence might not be the ultimate answer. (It's a kids' movie, after all.)The story is wonderfully told, but even better is the terrific animation, on par with – dare I bring them up again – Pixar. The movie is, naturally, up for Best Animated Feature this year, and it deserves to be. The voice roles are well cast, for the most part (it's easy to accept Butler as a Viking, but Baruchel's nasal whine gets a little tiresome). The action scenes are a pleasure to watch, rivaling (and even copying) Avatar, and the attention to detail looks impeccable. Interestingly enough, the end scene isn't quite what you expect. It's not a bad thing, and it's certainly not implausible. In fact, it's a heck of a lot more believable than what you'd get out of a typical animated movie. That unpredictability sort of buttresses the charming characterizations by Butler and (yes) Baruchel as father and son and earns this movie high marks.",8,0,0,13 February 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's final film uneven and, apparently, unfinished
","Many critics praised this film as the crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's long and illustrious career. Many critics are also full of deer feces. Seriously, I can't imagine people actually thinking this is an incredible movie - unless they're in awe of Kubrick, who brought to the world many magnificent films, including '2001: A Space Odyssey,' 'Barry Lyndon,' 'A Clockwork Orange,' and 'Paths of Glory.' Kubrick is indeed an auteur, but here he missed the boat. The late director, who also served as screenwriter, gives us a 2.5-hour piece of slop, as we follow Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) through a series of curious, if not altogether interesting, experiences. First he and Mrs. Dr. Bill (Nicole Kidman) go to a lavish party where each is kinda tempted to cheat on the other, but doesn't. Then they discuss it later and typical marital understanding ensues. Yes, you can almost recite the lines before they happen in that scene, folks. Angry, Bill leaves his wife, runs into a cheap (and, apparently, kind-hearted, JUST the kind of prostitute that's on the streets today, one can easily imagine) hooker, goes to a jazz club, and finally goes to a masquerade-cum-orgy ball. The first problem hits you right away. For a couple who are married in real life, Kidman and Cruise have zero chemistry in this film. They don't play off each other well at all, and even the mild sex scenes are real yawners. Beyond that is the script itself. One gets the impression that Kubrick had a much more developed movie in mind, but when he died the studio just released whatever was lying around. The script could have been so intriguing! The main problem with it is that is simply doesn't follow through on any premises. When a small storyline is introduced, it's just left after that brief introduction. And folks, when we're talking about a 159-minute movie, that's not easy to do. Which brings me to the last big problem of the movie. Every actor talks..... really...... slowly. Don't ask me why. And since Kubrick declined to use much in the way of background music (except for one annoyingly repetitive riff, meant to portend great ominence or something), the pauses between syllables are even more prolonged. So what we're left with is overblown, overstated, pretentious piffle. It's almost as if the auteur took bits of every art-house smash he'd ever scene and thrown them into a Cuisinart. Problem is the product is a gooey concoction of superficial gunk.",3,1,2,11 March 2000
The Descent," Chilling and claustrophobic
","Six adventurous friends, some recovering from a tragic accident a year earlier, embark on a spelunking expedition in big ol' cave in a desolate part of the Appalachian mountains. Suddenly, there's a rumbling in the earth, and the entrance is blocked behind them. And that's about when they realize they're not in a mapped cave, but rather a new cave that their ersatz leader Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) wanted them all to 'discover' and perhaps even be able to name.The women do not fall under the typical categories for horror films; all are strong, tough, kind, resilient, and indomitable. They don't screech at the slightest noise or movement just beyond their line of vision. At the same time, though, they're not all uberfit adrenaline junkies out for another thrill (one character remarks that she's an English teacher, not Tomb Raider). All bring something unique to the team, such as scouting, climbing, or medical knowledge.So there's your situation. Six experienced cavers are trapped in a cave that may or may not have more than one entrance. Will they be able to use their combined skills to find another way out? Perhaps, but the situation quickly worsens, as they discover they're not alone in the cave - one of their number spots a Gollum-like creature climbing the walls and ceiling of the cave. Eeek! The ladies discover that the creatures aren't benevolent at all; they're blind (think mole men, really) and track their prey by sound, like bats, and they're utterly carnivorous.The overall question that the movie poses to its audience is: Will the friends work as a team, as they always have, to escape their predicament, or will they turn on each other? It's not a question with a simple answer; the women all like each other, but they don't necessarily like each other equally, as would be the case in any small group. Take minor tension among them and add a severely traumatic situation, and nerves will be frayed, with possible tragic results.Director Neil Marshall did a fantastic job of scaring the bejeezus out of me at the appropriate times. This isn't a film that just throws a whole bunch of blood and guts at you, hoping something will metaphorically stick. The chills are calculated, sometimes coming one after the other, others laying in wait for the right time to pounce. Marshall's pacing prevents the film from lagging while not overwhelming the viewer with imagery and special effects. I imagine it's not easy to convey true dread and trepidation when most of your scenes are in literal darkness. Indeed, Marshall, who also wrote the screenplay, is perfectly adept at putting the viewer in the place of the six protagonists, allowing us to feel just as afraid as they do.To be sure, there are some minor problems with the plot. Sometimes the connection between certain items is a little too blunt (i.e., the camera lingers on something, so you just know it'll come into play somehow later in the film). But these problems really are inconsequential in the grand scope of the film.Personally, I found it to be particularly terrifying, because I am a little bit claustrophobic. Elevators are fine, but anything smaller than that would make me wig out. Some of the scenes in The Descent take place while the women are crawling through the tiniest crevice in the rocks - that, as a matter of fact, is where two of them find themselves when the cave entrance is abruptly closed. Truly frightening stuff.Another caveat, though: This is a very gory film. People are liberally covered in blood; there are stabbings and guttings and smashings and what not. If you're the type whose own blood makes you squeamish, you'd do well to avoid this film.",7,3,7,30 August 2006
Inside Man," Well plotted hostage thriller
","Denzel Washington plays Frazier, an opportunistic New York detective trying to redeem his career who lucks into being the man in charge of defusing a possible hostage situation at a downtown bank.Only things aren't what they seem. For one thing, the robbers are very deliberate, taking their time to accomplish their task. For another, powerbroker/go-to gal Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) appears on the scene at the behest of the bank's president (Christopher Plummer) to retrieve something that the bank president keeps in a safe-deposit box. Sounds like someone has something to hide, doesn't it? Well, Frazier smells a rat, but nothing he tries seems to work. He at first is content to sit back and let the chief bad guy (Clive Owen) indicate his terms and conditions, maybe get him to release a hostage or two. But there are too many unknown variables at play. No one knows how many gunmen there are, or how many hostages. Or, most importantly, how the baddies plan to escape, since they're surrounded by hundreds of law-enforcement people, vehicles, and guns.So this turns into a cat-and-mouse game between Washington and Owen. From the audience's perspective, we can see that the robbers have dressed the captives just as they themselves are (i.e., gray pullover, sunglasses, and white mask), and sometimes they release one - just enough to keep Washington's Frazier off balance. He can't figure out what they're up to, but he also can't storm the bank and take them by force without risking the lives of an unknown number of hostages.The story is told in overlapping time frames: the standoff and the aftermath. This is instructive to the audience, as we can ascertain how the standoff ends. Ah, but the strength of the plot lies in the details. As the title bluntly puts it, someone - or some people - who were in the bank when it was commandeered were in on the heist. But who? We see Frazier and his partner interview the hostages, trying to ferret out the robbers, and from what they say we can piece together the rest of the story.Spike Lee does a wonderful job of maintaining the tension of the situation without really forwarding the plot, but there are some small problems with the script. Washington's character seems a little too glib; he's not quite snarky, just kind of flippant at times, and it doesn't feel right with the scene. I'm not sure if this is a product of Washington's acting or Lee's directing, but the two usually mesh much more seamlessly.All in all, The Inside Man is is a taut whodunnit, reminiscent of movies like Dog Day Afternoon and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, films that highlighted the congealed multinational humanity that is New York, that should keep you guessing until the end, although it does raise a few questions more than it answers.",7,1,2,30 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Entertaining if controversial
","Unless you're the kind of person whose faith is so unsteady that a mere Hollywood movie can shake it, you'll probably find much to enjoy in The Da Vinci code. It has a bona fide leading man in Tom Hanks, a cute French femme fatale, a centuries-old mystery, and Gandalf/Magneto/Ian McKellen. It's longish, and perhaps a little overplotted (though not for the millions who've read the book on which it's based), but when it was over I felt satisfied that director Ron Howard had gotten it right. As usual.The curator of the Louvre is found murdered, but before finally expiring he leaves a cryptic message in his own blood that induces Chief Inspector Fache (Jean Reno) to contact a visiting Harvard scholar, Robert Langdon (Hanks). Fache thinks the message indicates Langdon's guilt regarding the murder, but another officer, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) feels otherwise. What was the curator trying to say? The chase - and effort to prove Langdon innocent leads the duo around Europe, immersing them deep in the legends of Jesus Christ, the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, and Mary Magdelene. It's important to remember, though, that the book on which this movie is based is a work of fiction. For the learning impaired, that means the author makes no claims of authenticity - the storyline has been concocted for the purposes of entertainment.Along the way, Robert and Sophie meet up with Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen), a Grail scholar/devotee/nutcase. McKellen spins a yarn about what everyone's really after, managing to deal a couple of serious blows to the basic tenets of Christianty as we know it in the process. And no, of course I'm not going to note what those surprises might entail, although by now most people have an inkling or two.While Robert and Sophie struggle to find clues regarding the curator's murder - and clues pertaining to the Grail itself - other, more sinister forces are afoot. An albino monk (Paul Bettany) has the mission of finding the location of the Holy Grail - and then preventing at all costs anyone from ever finding out. Then there's a semicorrupt bishop and the Pope, but they both just have cameos. Not the real bishop and Pope, though; that would be quite the casting coup.Hanks is well cast. If we're to believe the rumors, Bill Paxton was Howard's first choice. If you're Tom Hanks, how do you deal with your favorite director wanting Bill Paxton over you? It's gotta hurt at least a teeny bit. On the other hand, Tautou was chosen instead of some pretty strong competition, like Sophie Marceau and Julie Delpy, and she has excellent chemistry with Hanks. They're not supposed to be lovers, just two semirandom people thrust into increasingly odd situations. Both roles are well written, and the actors are well up to the task.As good as Hanks and Tautou are, though, McKellen is extraordinary, owning every one of his scenes. Sir Ian has given plenty of commanding performances in recent years, and although this one may someday be dwarfed in retrospect by the roles of Gandalf and Magneto, it's no less compelling.The Da Vinci code is perhaps even better than the book, because the book wasn't terribly good. A riveting, well-paced religious-mystery/thriller is supplemented nicely by a fine cast.",7,4,8,23 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Abracadabra! Voila! Boy, what a wizard
","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a 10-year old British lad who has a zigzag scar on his forehead. He lives with his aunt and uncle and rotund, snotty cousin, who thoroughly despise him and make him live in a cupboard below a staircase. And all looks quite lost until the day Harry receives an invitation to attend the prestigious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he's carried away by the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).Harry quickly learns that his mom and dad were a witch and wizard, respectively, and that they died while protecting him from the superevil Voldemort (also known as He Who Must Not Be Named); but Harry also learns that there's something about him that protects him from Voldemort. With his trusted new friends Ron and Hermione, Harry must find out what's in the trap door at Hogwarts that's guarded by a three-headed dog named Fluffy - and that certain bad guy or guys wants to get a hold of. As serious as the plot seems, this is a most fanciful movie. It's quick paced, so as not to let the little kippers fall asleep, and is full of all of the dazzling effects you'd expect from a wizards and witches movie. It has quite a few things going for it (it did make a zillion dollars, so it must have something going for it), including a brisk, crisp script that's pretty close to the book, excellent performances from top to bottom, and those omnipresent effects that by now are fairly workaday to most of us.
Author J. K. Rowling insisted that all of the cast - or at least those with speaking roles - be British, and as a result we get some of England's finest: Richard Harris (who's actually Irish), John Hurt, Maggie Smith, Ian Hunt, John Cleese, Richard Griffith, Julie Walters, Coltrane, and Alan Rickman. It's a magnificent roster, and each actor appears to be having a great time playing dress-up and spouting some downright hilarious lines.This is a popcorn movie. Is it a date movie? Um, no. Your date might think you're an idiot if you sit down to watch this. But it IS a great movie to watch with your kids, and you might even get them to read the books. And hey, anything that gets kids to read something thicker than a pamphlet is usually a good thing. Plus the special effects merely enhance the show; they aren't the show itself. The real star is the precocious Radcliffe (who's been signed to a few more Potter films, by the way) , who essays the young magician perfectly. Too often kids come off as snotty or impossibly cute in movies; Radcliffe is neither, and neither, by extension, is Harry Potter. I've seen too many films in which the kids are nothing more than glorified brats, even when they're the heroes - but not our fair Mr. Potter, who saves the day through his courage, wits, and intelligence. Oh yes, and love.",8,0,0,4 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Smashing, dark story - well done
","The HP movies continue to wow and amaze me. As they progress, they're getting darker and more adult, much like Harry Potter himself. In the beginning, they felt more like kids' movies that adults could enjoy, and now the tables have been turned a bit.This fourth movie covers Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts. The Goblet of the title is a magical urn that spits out the names of three contestants for that year's Triwizards Tournament. Ah, but there's a fourth name belched by the goblet, and to no viewer's surprise, it belongs to Young Mr. Potter.No one knows how Harry's name made its way into the Goblet, especially since there's a curse on it that prevents anyone under 17 from submitting a name, and Harry insists he didn't even try. But rules is rules, and Harry's the fourth contestant. The quartet must face three challenges, including dragons, merpeople, and a labyrinth. We know, of course, that Harry will make it through all of these tasks relatively intact, since his further exploits (books five and six) have already been published. But how does he do it? What new characters will attempt to foil him, and what new friends will he make? Hogwarts is the host school for the tournament, and so two other schools will be spending the year with the Hogwarts students - a bevy of French lasses and a squadron of strapping central European lads. It is from these two schools, plus one from Hogwarts and Harry himself, that the four contestants are selected by the Goblet.But perhaps Harry's biggest challenge is a rather mundane one - finding a date to the Yule Ball. Perhaps the most endearing quality of Rowling's books (and the movies) is that Harry, underneath it all, is really just another teenager. He's alternately whiny, paranoid, unhappy, and joyful. And now he and his chums have been told they'll all be taking dance lessons so they can look good on the floor later that year.Of course, adding to the fun is the latest Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Alastor 'Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who has - as you might guess - one working eye and a sort of robotic eye that has a telescopic lens. And at least one fake leg. He kind of looks like the love child of C-3PO and the Skipper from Gilligan's Island. The Dark Arts teacher is traditionally a one-year wonder - something always happens - so the mystery is what'll happen to Moody, not if it'll happen at all.Rowling's world is so well defined that new characters can be introduced in the books but mentioned only fleetingly in the movies - and we're none the worse for it. For example, Madame Maxime, a half-giantess who's the headmistress of the French school, falls for (surprise!) Hagrid, the half-giant. Ah, true love. We don't see much of them, but when we do see Madame Maxime her appearances aren't incongruous; they, in fact, help further the plot.Since the movies are getting darker (tough times ahead!), we see less and less of the cute touches that inhabited the first two films, such as buying books in Diagon Alley, boarding the train to Hogwarts, seeing Hagrid greeting the first year students, and so forth. But in its place, we get a LOT of fantastic effects, such as Harry outracing and outmaneuvering a flying dragon - on his broom, of course; Harry speaking with Sirius via the Gryffindor fire, and the Quidditch World Cup. These scenes aren't just wowie scenes done to shock and amaze the audience; they feel perfectly plausible and logical, not gratuitous.Mike Newell is the director this time around (the third director in the series), and the first Briton to helm one of the movies. He's really adept at staging action scenes without distracting the audience with special effects - which is not to say the effects aren't grand, just that they're not the only thing the movie has going for it.Everyone seems to be aging with their roles rather well (although Maggie Smith's looking longer in the tooth than usual, perhaps, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is much more energetic than Richard Harris' was), and I was pleased to see that there wasn't too much attention paid to the romantic angles of the story (particularly regarding the ball). I was further pleased to see the friendship of Hermione, Ron, and Harry being reevaluated. Readers of the series know that the interrelationships of these three friends will change drastically in due time, and it's good to see just a hint of it here (rather than dwelling on it to the point of detracting from the rest of the story).I would not recommend that kids under a certain age watch this movie. It is the first in the series to be rated PG-13 (fitting, since Harry is now 14), and its dark themes - including children in peril, death, serious injury - will probably be too much for the younger set who liked the first two films in the series.All in all, I thought Goblet was the best of the bunch so far. Often, by the time a there's a fourth in a movie series, the characters are so well worn that one can rather easily predict what's going to happen to them. But this isn't the case here, and that might be at least partly due to the changing directors (and tone). We're familiar with Harry and his friends, and we root for them, but they never become so bland - or, to the other extreme, wacky for the sake of being wacky - that they become tiresome, not by a long shot.",9,0,7,18 November 2005
In Time," Yawner for a sci-fi movie
","In Time is one of those sci-fi movies that takes a preposterous premise and spends its time trying desperately to make it seem reasonable. When a movie begins with an out-there plot (here, in that people use time as currency in order to live past age 25), it must support that storyline with something that makes the viewer forget how illogical it all is. In Time doesn't quite do that.Thanks to a helpful plot device called genetic modification, in the future everyone lives to be exactly 25 years old, and then they have one year left (without aging), during which time they must barter, beg, borrow, steal in order to live longer. Weird premise (why would they genetically modify themselves to this end?), but okay. It is what it is, to use a cliché. Also, the world (city?) has been divided into districts, each well guarded, and each of course set up according to one's class. It's kind of interesting to see one district paying for a bus fare of ten minutes and another one betting one million years in a poker game.Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is from the slums and lives day to day with his mom, played briefly by Olivia Wilde. Will helps a stranger who happens to have a century stored up in him (don't ask how) out of danger in a seedy bar, only to watch helplessly as the same stranger, having donated almost all of his time to Will while the former slept, jump to his death. Naturally, a public camera recorded this, and just as naturally Will is suspected of murder.The rest of the plot is just as simple, really. Will, who's running out of time in more ways than one, kidnaps the daughter of a rich businessman in order to, you know, buy more time. They meet cute, she helps him, and so on. Sure, it's implausible, but don't you know she's a rebel who's been chafing under the constant surveillance from her father? She even has guards in her hoity-toity district!Yes, it's another fight-the-system-that-keeps-the-proles-in-line movie. It might remind you of The Island, which (despite being directed by Michael Bay) wasn't too bad. It, too, involved genetics and the morality of messing with them. But it's not an altogether favorable comparison. The Island had strong leads (Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson) and strong support from guys like Michael Clarke Duncan and Djimon Hounsou. In Time has Timberlake and, as the kidnapped daughter, Amanda Seyfreid. Seyfried usually plays blondes, leading me to believe she IS blonde, and here she is brunette. Trouble is, she looks like she's wearing a wig. She's not supposed to look like that, is she? Only if you're a hooker should you LOOK like you're wearing a wig. Just my opinion.Timberlake is quite good, really, but he's up against what's really a dopey plot under a veneer of sci-fi creativity. The genetics angle is almost absent from the movie - the focus is on how much time people have, how they can get more, time lenders, time stealers, time keepers (like Cillian Murphy, here). Some people desperately want to live forever, hence the wagering of huge durations of time, whereas some, like Will Salas, just want to have enough time to get them through a day. Apparently this makes life more interesting.Had this movie any real depth, it would have examined not only the moral implications of generically engineering humans to live only so long (while still allowing for extensions) but also the idea of literally wasting time. Live life to the fullest, make the most of your opportunities, stuff like that. But I didn't get any of that from this film at all. What I got was a lot of running, car chases, gunplay, sexual tension - you know, what you'd find in a typical Hollywood action movie anyway. But this one didn't even reach its low standards. In Time may sound intriguing (ooh! genetic modification!), but it's nothing more than a garden-variety action movie set in yet another dystopian future, pitting the haves versus the have-nots. It's derivative, bereft of twists of any nature. It's, yes, I'll say it, a waste of time.",4,0,1,15 September 2012
Thor," Not a Thor loser
","Thor is exactly what a comic-book movie ought to be – it's packed with action and great effects, it's true to its source material, it gives us characters we actually care about, and it's a tense melodrama with connections to Shakespeare. The entire cast is engaging – and some very nice to look at, depending on your persuasion – and all in all it's a well-told glorious spectacle.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an Asgardian prince, son of King Odin (check your Norse mythology). Hot-headed, impetuous, prone to violence, and quite full of himself, he is nonetheless next in line for the throne. Just before his coronation is complete, however, intruders from Jotunheimm infiltrate Asgard; although they're quickly dispatched, Thor demands revenge, and against his father's explicit orders, he and his friends (including his brother, Loki) travel to Jotunheim to seek answers – and kick butt, if necessary and possible. Odin finds out and saves them, but he strips Thor of his powers – including his great hammer, Mjolnir, and banishes him to Earth to teach him a lesson in humility.This banishment serves to open the door for treachery in Asgard, allowing the Frost Giants of Jotunheim to wage war against the Asgardians. Meanwhile, some of that trouble is spilled toward Earth, where Thor has fallen under the romantic spell of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Suffice to say that bad things come at the populace of a small town in New Mexico, with only a now-mortal Thor able to help them.But this movie is about more than just bad guys plotting to take over the universe; it's about father-son relationships and the rivalry between a favored son and 'the other brother.' There's a lot of Henry V and King Lear afoot, and this is due in no small part to the movie's director, the great Kenneth Branagh. Branagh is not the first person you'd think of to direct a movie based on a comic book, but he manages here to not only keep the expected characterizations and plot fresh but also to instill a sense of classicism and wonderment.The CGI is pretty well utilized (although some of the early scenes in Jotunheim made me realize they WERE computer generated, which is almost the opposite of what you'd want), and what's more it doesn't seem to distract from the plot. In some movies, effects serve as noise to prevent the audience from discovering that the story doesn't make much sense. Branagh isn't subtle in his use of technology, but this isn't a movie that really should be subtle. Thor himself certainly isn't.Hemsworth, a newcomer to the States from Australia, is solid in the title role, much better than, say, Sam Worthington would have been. Hemsworth is sturdy and ripped, so he fits Thor's physical description, but he can also do a little bit of the acting as well. Portman, you may recall, is now an Oscar winner, and she's a delight here in a role similar to Liv Tyler's and Jennifer Connelly's in the two recent Hulk films; the smart femme fatale. In fact, her character reminded me quite a bit of Jodie Foster's character in Contact – a determined, resolved, super-smart researcher determined to find out what in Sam Hill is going on around here.Anthony Hopkins plays Odin as you'd expect Anthony Hopkins to play a king: regally, with a weary toughness. Idris Elba, Kat Denning, Stellan Skarsgard, Tom Hiddleston, Ray Stevenson, and a couple of uncredited cameos are also well cast.You can expect to see more of Thor and his stories – his Thories? – in the coming years. This movie is a product of Marvel Studios, and upcoming releases will focus on other Marvel Comics' characters, such as Captain America and The Avengers. Plus there are to be reboots of Spider-Man and (maybe) The Hulk. And they'll all tie together, along with Iron Man.So Thor is every bit as entertaining as I thought it'd be. It's classy without being out of reach for the rest of us; it's not some highfalutin Royal Theater production, but neither is it a simple slam-bang cacophony of senseless violence.",7,0,2,7 May 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Complex second Matrix
","If you've seen The Matrix (1999), then you'll appreciate this movie. If you haven't, you're going to be lost. There's a lot in here that depends on the plot of the original. So please, go see the original before seeing this sequel.The Matrix itself is basically everything you see - the entire planet, the movie says, is controlled by machines. Only a select few know this, and their mission in life is to free the minds of others who are enslaved by the Matrix, leading them to the city of Zion, located about the Earth's core.One of the chief rebels is Morpheus, played by Lawrence Fishburne. Morpheus, in the original movie, thinks he's stumbled upon The One, the person who can save Zion and the rest of humanity from the Matrix. That would be Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.As the second movie opens, the machines have discovered Zion and are tunneling to it. It's only a matter of time before they tunnel through and kill all those inside. But rather than fortify the defenses of the city, Morpheus believes in the prophecy of The One. He defies the orders of the city's elders and brings Neo back to the surface (that is, the Matrix) so that he can meet with the wise Oracle.Are you confused yet? There are many themes here, some of which are philosophical and metaphysical in nature. One can view this movie on two fronts: as a gritty action movie or as a thought-provoking drama.Reloaded is replete with some eye-opening special effects, many of which were computer generated. In one scene, Neo combats the evil Agent Smith. Oh, but not just one Agent Smith - 100 of them at once. It's not like those cheesy kung fu movies where the villains take turns beating up on Bruce Lee; in this one, they attack simultaneously. Another scene features a fight atop a tractor-trailer on a crowded freeway.It's tough to convey all of the complexities of the plot. In fact, this is a movie that people - like the original - will need to watch multiple times just to catch all of the plot twists. What does it all mean? And even more important, what's it all leading to? This is the second movie of the series, with the third one coming out in November this year.Rather than delve into the intricacies of the storyline, let me give you some pros and cons. If you're a fan of the series, you're going to go no matter what I say, and if you thought the first one was a waste or not for you anyway, you won't be going to this one.Let's look at the acting. It's wooden. Keanu Reeves was born to play this role, as it requires little to no emoting. Plus, he looks cool in shades and a trenchcoat. I'll admit it, he looks very good, and in the non-computer-generated fight scenes, he looks somewhat plausible.
His love interest, the mysterious Trinity, is played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Another one who simply cannot act, so she fits right in. Now, this may be a simple matter of personal tastes, but she's astoundingly unattractive. She's Neo's love interest, and yet the two of them have absolutely no chemistry. It's like watching a totem pole and a mop mate. Eew.Even Fishburne didn't come off perfectly. Some of his lines sound like they came off a cereal box top. Sure, that's no fault of Larry, but his delivery had the resonance of a funeral dirge. He's a very commanding figure, though, and he does deliver a solid performance as Morpheus.Okay, so maybe the acting isn't wonderful. Who cares, right? You don't watch these movies for the emoting. Let's see some tail being kicked!The action sequences are very good, although not quite as overwhelming as those in the original. There are some additions - Agent Smith can replicate, and Neo can now fly. The flying thing is key, but quite frankly he just looks like Superman with a different color cape. Even so, the sequences themselves are good. The problem is that sometimes they seemed to be thrown into the movie for no real reason other than to have an action scene. Another problem is that these scenes seemed to come right from a Nintendo game. You know, the type where you hit something like up and right and the B button to do a freaky Street Fighter move on someone? Plus several times in each scene, the action is paused so that the audience can get the full effect, since everyone's moving so quickly.Another big difference between this movie and the original is that although the original was pretty philosophical itself, it expressed philosophical themes with tangible objects, such as the pills and the spoon. You see? We normal folk can grasp those concepts when the themes are expressed in that manner. But the second film relies more on abstract concepts, and that might lose people who don't have doctorates in Jungian theories.The ending is a little bit of a downer, but since we know it's leading up to the third film, we shouldn't feel particularly let down. Yes, it's 'to be continued,' but this movie more than stands on its own. Think of it more as an episode.",7,0,0,12 June 2003
Mystic River," Fantastic!
","Clint Eastwood's film is unsettling, designed to keep make you feel uneasy for a week afterwards, and it's largely successful.As kids, Dave, Jimmy, and Sean were inseparable. Until the day thugs masquerading as cops abducted Dave and kept him in a cellar for four days. This, of course, messed Dave up a little, and as an adult he's not quite all there.Fast-forward to the present. Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie is brutally murdered, and suddenly the three friends, who have drifted a bit over the years, are brought back together. Sean, who's now a cop, is on the case.The movie was nominated for six Oscars and won two (Penn as Jimmy, Robbins as Dave). To me, it was spellbinding. When I'm watching a movie at home, there are plenty of little distractions - Oh, I need something to eat, Oh, I gotta go to the bathroom, Oh, the dog needs to go out, and so forth - and as a result if the movie isn't totally compelling I'll watch it in installments. But with Mystic River I didn't even notice the time until the movie was nearly an hour old. Eastwood's direction - and Brian Helgeland's screenplay - were so mesmerizing that I was completely drawn into the movie, believing every second, feeling like I was a bystander, rather than an audience. That is excellent filmmaking.Also in the incredible cast are Marcia Gay Harden (who earned a nomination herself), Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney, and Tom Guiry. (Guiry has come into his own as an adult actor; I remember seeing him in 1993's The Sandlot as the new kid in town.)A must-see for fans of mystery/suspense movies.",9,0,0,3 July 2004
Zombieland," Fantastic, offbeat
","Zombieland is a gleefully twisted mockumentary about a world full of you-know-whats, wherein only five living people remain in the entire world. It’s gory and disgusting, but most of all, it’s terrific fun, with just the right mix of violence and off-kilter comedy.Jesse Eisenberg plays a young man named Columbus (because that’s where he’s heading, across the wasteland that is the middle US). Columbus is scared of just about everything: clowns, the cloths people use to wipe down tables, bathrooms, you name it. A hot apartment neighbor comes down with this hot new disease that all the cool kids don’t want to have, and before you know it he’s killed her (well, rekilled) and is on the run, fleeing zombies and making up a long list of rules of how to survive in the eponymous new land. Near the beginning of our story, he meets up with a man he calls Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), who’s, uh, on his way to Tallahassee, and they in turn meet with a couple of con girls (Abagail Breslin and Emma Stone).Comparisons to Shaun of the Dead are somewhat apt, as both movies are comedic takes on a horror subgenre, and director Ruben Fleischer was influenced by the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost movie. But. Zombieland is both funnier and more sincere; it’s not a slapstick comedy, and it’s not really a horror film, as Shaun of the Dead was. In fact, it’s sort of quirky and genreless.There were a LOT of laugh-out-loud moments for me in this movie, and I think a chief reason it all gels is that the leads are so perfectly cast. Eisenberg is awesome as the protagonist, the vulnerable hero, and Harrelson is a real hoot as the Mad-Max-like (or maybe Ash from Evil Dead) gentle psycho who desires nothing more than to waste zombies and find one, just one, Twinkie. Yes, I said Twinkie! I also really liked Abagail Breslin as the moppet Little Rock. It’s always tough for child actors to make the transition into more-adult roles, but she’s up to the task here. Emma Stone is tough and sweet as her sisterly counterpart.There’s a cameo that’ll surely surprise you – and what’s more, it really works. The actor – no spoilers here! – really sells the role. Let’s just say that he plays himself. Did I mention that the main characters are headed to California and that basically everyone else in the world is either dead or a zombie? Everyone? You don’t often hear people applaud during a movie, but applaud we did at a couple key moments. The final scene in an amusement park is witty and lighthearted, at least as lighthearted as mowing down zombies with machine guns can be.Now, granted, there’s plenty of blood splattering, plenty of gore, plenty of cursing, and even some nudity. And yes, it’s even gratuitous. But not for a zombie movie. For a zombie movie, those things are sort of underplayed a little bit, at least in the true horror sense – they’re played much more for chuckles than anything else. If anything, Zombieland is a movie that dares you to take it seriously, just so it can pull the rug out from under you and we can all laugh. It’s an offbeat look at an overused genre that cranks out the guts and guffaws in equal, lethal doses.",8,52,94,21 September 2009
A Beautiful Mind," Powerful, quiet, effortless Crowe
","A Beautiful Mind
Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says 'Russell Crowe', you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a 'hunk' - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",9,129,152,23 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," True to spirit of original
","Harry Potter returns to the wizard school Hogwarts for his second year of schooling, along with his friends Ron and Hermione. But danger's afoot for the boy wizard. Before the start of his second year, Harry is visited by a House Elf named Dobby. Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts, but of course Harry doesn't heed his warning. Besides, he must escape from the clutches of his cruel, nasty adoptive family.So Harry's busted out from his imprisoned bedroom by Ron and his brothers in their flying car. It occurs to me here that this is a movie that might be just a little bit far out and trippy if viewed while under an influence not quite the same as reality. Ron's flying car takes the boys back to their family's house; unlike Harry's adoptive parents, Ron's parents are both magical practitioners; purebred magicians, if you will. It is with the Weasley family that Harry returns to the school.But alas and alack! Ron and Harry miss the train back to Hogwarts! Ah, the flying car; that'll do, that'll do. Naturally, they almost crash into the train with the car, and actually do crash into a particularly nasty gigantic tree on the grounds of Hogwarts. Eats cars, you know.That's just the beginning, though. The boys, joined by their friend Hermione, learn that people are being petrified for no discernable reason at Hogwarts. Who's to blame? Is it Snape, the professor with an obvious disdain for Harry? Is it Malfoy, the slicked-back blonde bully? Or is it the newest professor, Gilderoy Lockhart? The early evidence points to Harry, of course, and Hagrid, the Gamekeeper.Harry and his pals must follow the sometimes obscure clues to find out who's responsible for this skullduggery. What's worse, the headmaster, Professor Dumbeldore, is under pressure to find the culprit. And for some reason, there's this creepy whispering voice traveling through the halls of Hogwarts that only Harry can hear - and, for some reason, he can now talk to snakes? Does all of this tie in together, somehow?Well, of course it does. The appeal isn't the end result, it's the journey. This is about as good as the first Harry Potter movie, full of the same mystical charm, although the kids are growing up a bit (the boys in particular are hitting puberty, what with their deepening voices and all). I haven't read the books, but from what I'm told the movie follows the second book rather closely. A real treat for sure is seeing all of the veddy excellent veteran British actors in the cast: Kenneth Branagh,  Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Alan Rickman, Miriam Margolyes, and Richard Griffiths.The Chamber of Secrets is about what you'd expect from a Harry Potter movie; it has style, substance, verve, and audacity. The latter is because the movie dares to be as good as the original, if not better. All too often the sequel to a hit movie tries to rest on the laurels of the first film, not venturing out on its own. While it's evident that Chamber of Secrets is part of a series, it's also an excellent standalone movie.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is rated PG for 'scary moments'; in fact, there are some gross ones, as well. Which means your kids'll love it! The movie is 161 minutes long, so stock up on the popcorn.",8,0,1,22 January 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Charming performances, good action
","John Smith (Brad Pitt) is an assassin for hire. Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) is, too. They work for different companies, and neither one knows the other's true occupation. Until they're hired to kill each other. *cue suspense music*Thanks to the excellent chemistry between Pitt and Jolie and some riveting action scenes, the movie manages to lift itself above most others in the genre. That is to say, it's not just another dumb shoot-em-up, although not as brainy as, for example, The Bourne Identity. The mutual discovery that their spouse is a hit man doesn't occur until a good half hour into the film, but once it does, you're treated to a series of fast-paced scenes in the tradition of The War of the Roses, including a decimation of the couple's home. The trouble is that I can't give you too much of the plot without telling you the twists, because there aren't that many to begin with. But as long as you concentrate on the combined hotness of the starring duo - so smoldering that sparks flew off-set as well - you'll be fine. Don't let the story distract you!Doug Liman, who gave us such instant classics as Swingers, Go, and The Bourne Identity, keeps things moving pretty quickly, although a peek at the goofs page on IMDb will show that enough errors were made to make one question the editing. Still, the action scenes pack quite a wallop, particularly the close hand-to-hand combat between the Smiths in their house. The story varies for the most part from implausible to improbable, as is often the case with action films. But Pitt and Jolie both look right for their respective parts, including handling firearms and other weapons. What impressed me is that neither character seemed particularly moralistic about their line of work. For example, no 'oh, we kill only bad guys!' junk - they kill whomever, whenever, wherever. Particularly amusing is the scene in which they reveal to each other how many kills they've had.Vince Vaughn is on hand as Eddie, who works with John, and even though his role is very small, he manages to walk off with every scene he's in. That's because Jolie and Pitt wisely underplay their roles, leaving the fireworks to take center stage. Oh, and their obvious good looks, too.",7,0,4,8 January 2006
The Departed," Very disappointing; poor writing, hamminess sink it
","Matt Damon is a sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police who's secretly working for Jack Nicholson's gang. Leonardo DiCaprio is a former bad boy deep undercover in Nicholson's gang. But whose side is each really on? And will this end in anything but total, major bloodshed? The answer to the first question is, 'Who cares'; to the second, 'duh.' Like many people, I went into this movie with high expectations, but unlike most (judging from the early returns), I was pretty disappointed with the result. Let's take a look at some of the good and bad points.1. Martin Scorcese directed it, so I was expecting not only a lot of gunplay and a lot of profanity, but a lucid screenplay. I mean, this is the guy who did Goodfellas, for crying out loud, which this movie should have closely resembled. In case you forgot, he also did Raging Bull and Mean Streets. Now, granted, Scorcese didn't write the script, but cmon. He's got the clout to make changes to it on the set.2. Jack Nicholson is just all right. I like Jack. (Who doesn't? Seriously.) But nowadays, he plays the same basic character no matter the role, no matter if he's a Good Guy or a Bad Guy. He's Jack. Apparently, Robert DeNiro was approached to play the role of Frank Costello, but he was busy working on his own film, The Good Shepherd. So enter Smilin' Jack, and I dunno; I think DeNiro would have been much, much better.3.Profanity. No, I like profanity. Love it! Even gratuitously, it's usually perfectly okay. See, for example, the aforementioned Goodfellas. But it seemed here that profanity was used merely to see how many times the f word and c word could be said in a movie. After a while (say an hour), it quickly got tiresome, sounding more like a high school locker room than anything else.4. Comic relief. Who said there needed to be comic relief? Someone must have thought so, because we had not one but two comic roles: Alec Baldwin's Ellerby and Mark Wahlberg's Dignan. Okay, they weren't there solely for comic relief, but they were given funny lines that seemed wholly incongruous with the rest of the picture. Instead of being a subtle change in direction (you're expecting drama and they shift to comedy), the result is jarring. When the timing is right, it works, but more often than not I wondered what the actors were doing in the same movie as Nicholson, DiCaprio, and Damon.5. Damon and DiCaprio. I've never been a huge fan of either one, although I've like Damon's Bourne movies to a degree. I think my primary complaint is that they both perpetually look about sixteen years old, not the kind of persona you want in a purportedly gritty crime drama. They both have more gravitas now than they did, say, ten years ago, but still nowhere near enough to carry the heavy workload, characterwise, that this particular type of movie demands.6. Accents. The setting is Boston, and most of the leads are playing Irish Americans. Damon, who's from Massachusetts, and DiCaprio sounded fine, but Nicholson's Boston accent came and went - it was usually absent, come to think of it.Like I said, the screenplay didn't feel particularly tight; it's as if the writers (William Monahan and Siu Fai Mak) just borrowed from all of the cop films of the past without providing any nuance to hold interest. For example, there was a subplot involving the girlfriend/fiancée/wife of Damon's character. Why? I'm not saying we shouldn't know anything about her, but she didn't seem to be much of an influence on Damon's character anyway, so why bother with her? Oh, I see, so that we could include a second romantic angle with her and someone else. But why would we want that? Bring on the guns, bring on the cussin, and ditch the romance - it neither enhances the plot or titillates the audience. (Kristin Dalton, who played the love interest in question, didn't turn in much of a performance, but I don't think she exactly had a layer-rich character with which she could work.) Then there's the obligatory sex scene, which should have felt erotic but came off as awkward, as did the two (yes, two) first-date scenes. Bah.Here's a positive remark, though. Kudos to an on-target performance by Martin Sheen, as DiCaprio's boss. Might be his best work in movies in years, kind of an expanded version of his role in Catch Me If You Can, also starring DiCaprio.Another plus, perhaps, is the high body count. Lots of death in this one, and it's not just unknown extras who get whacked. And the deaths are particularly gruesome at times - bullets through the skull, plenty of 'em, leave huge splatters of blood on the back walls of elevators. That sort of thing. A loudmouth audience member to the left of me wailed that it was 'just like a Shakespeare play!' True enough, because so many of the main characters of those tragedies were slain, usually quite unceremoniously.So maybe I'm just a grump. Maybe I've reached the point where no movie can satisfy me, particularly when I pay nearly ten bucks to watch it in a theater full of incredibly stupid and/or rude people. Maybe I'm too jaded to appreciate true genius. But I don't think so; I think a year or so from now, we won't even remember The Departed as anything more than a slight footnote to Scorcese's great career.",5,3,5,28 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Don't be deceived - it's loud but generally worthless
","This cacophonous sequel to the 2007 blockbuster is a relentlessly incomprehensible mess. Alleged director Michael Bay, a firm believer in the throw-everything-at-the-wall theory of film-making, manages to overwhelm the senses with a teeth-rattling soundtrack and a blistering, epilepsy-inducing barrage of metallic imagery. Oh, there's a story in there, something about preventing an evil robot from destroying the sun, but it's almost completely irrelevant.Since the movie is a direct follow up to the last Transformers film, some background is necessary. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBoeuf) is preparing to go to college, away from his new sweetheart Mikaela (Megan Fox) and his new alien robot best friend, Bumblebee. Meanwhile, Optimus Prime (a good robot) is helping the world's armies take on stray Decepticons (bad robots), who are trying to revive their old leader Megatron, find Sam, and aid another bad robot named The Fallen (see what they did there?).Most of the scenes involve Sam (and Mikaela, and others in their posse) running from place to place, getting shot at by apparently the slowest giant robots in the universe. But not like in films like National Treasure or Angels and Demons, where a mystery was being solved and the protagonist was running from place to place because time was almost up for them to solve said mystery. More like running around just so that more robot battle scenes could be included. I mean, it doesn't really have to have a point, right? One big problem is that the robots are sort of hard to distinguish from one another. Some are pretty easy, like Optimus Prime (he's blue and red) and Bumblebee (he's yellow), and the Twins Mudflap and Skids, or even The Fallen, who has an elongated faceplate. There are gray-metal robots who are Decepticons (colorless = evil?), but then there are some who are Autobots. Add to this confusion the fact that the fight scenes move at a breakneck pace, so even if you can tell who's fighting whom, you really can't tell what specifically is being done.The movie is also about an hour too long (it's two and a half hours total). There are too many battle scenes anyway, and there are too many characters to keep track of. Slice it down to a manageable running time and chop out some secondary characters - keep the battles to just the most obvious players - and maybe there would be a coherent, cohesive movie. But Michael Bay directed this, and he's known for doing the opposite of what a good filmmaker would do.As for the acting... well, I don't want to be negative. I'm kidding, of course I do. Being negative is easier than being positive. But it's double-plus easier for a film like this, because it's so clichéd and so overwrought. The acting is subpar; everyone hams it up, probably because they don't want to be overshadowed by robots. (They are anyway.) LaBoeuf is not a good actor, never has been. He's not a good action-movie type, frankly; you don't look at him and see hero, you see nincompoop. He doesn't inspire so much as react. This was never more evident than in the latest Indiana Jones movie, when sixtysomething Harrison Ford - not a great actor, but an appealing one - was far more convincing than LaBoeuf. You're supposed to look at LaBoeuf and think he's a guy next door, and instead you look at him and think he's a self-aggrandizing little twit. Or maybe that's just me.Megan Fox is in this movie basically to look pretty - check out, as I did, the endless pans over her young, lithe body, and you know exactly who's in the intended audience. (Note: It's not sixty-year-old women.) The appropriately named Fox is all pouty lips and gleaming teeth, and she's likable enough, but she's given little to do other than dote on LaBoeuf awkwardly.As for the rest of the cast, it's a clash of acting styles. John Turturro returns as Agent Simmons, and he's wackier than ever; Ramon Rodriguez plays Sam's new college roommate, web entrepreneur Leo, and he's deranged and a wuss. Sam's parents are played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White, who shamelessly mug - White's character in particular is needlessly loony. She was probably supposed to be comic relief, but she comes off as annoying.This isn't a great thrill ride, as the previews might lead you to believe. It's not even a Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. It's more like the It's a Small World ride, a ride that ceaselessly repeats the same refrain just to irritate the pants off you, figuratively speaking, resulting in a desperate wish for it all to be over.",4,4,11,27 June 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," The bin Laden Identity
","Zero Dark Thirty will appeal to fans of action movies, and the fact that it is based on true events should complement that appeal. It's an odd- duck movie in that the ending is never in doubt; only the path to the goal. The hunt for the most notorious terrorist of them all, Osama bin Laden, occurs over a ten-year period from the point of view of the Americans and, chiefly, the CIA operative running the operation. It is very compelling, riveting stuff. However, I don't feel that it is a great film; despite a remarkable performance by Jessica Chastain and solid camera work, the movie comes off at its worst as over-the-top jingoism masquerading as patriotism, making America look great to those who wave their arms at how Number One the good ol' USA is, the best of the best, and making America look terrible, perhaps, to those who are not American.The movie is unflinching in its depiction of violent methods, but we should get one thing clear right away: it's a work of fiction based on true events. Just because something occurs in this film does not mean it happened in real life.The film is difficult to watch for a couple of main reasons. For one, there is audio of phone calls from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and those alone may raise your hackles. Then there is the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture, and knowing that this sort of thing did go on after 2001 makes for some harrowing viewing. Here's an interesting comparison for you. Adolph Hitler was a genocidal maniac. When the war was closing in on him, he took his own life, thus depriving his enemies the same satisfaction. Bin Laden, however, did not; he continued to operate remotely, unseen except by the occasional video to al-Jazeera. His mere presence kept people angry, demanding action. Whereas Hitler's death definitively ended WW II, bin Laden's survival began a new one. What if bin Laden, who had been cooped up in the caves in Tora Bora, had killed himself? No war, perhaps, and no real satisfaction on the part of America and its comrades.Maya (Chastain) is a neophyte operative when she begins the search for bin Laden. She needs to fight bureaucracy and lack of good leads; she travels from Langley (CIA headquarters) to Yemen to Pakistan to Afghanistan and on and on, surviving only on her zeal to capture the fugitive. We're never really told why this all means so much to her, after a decade of work. Is it personal, or is just for the sake of country? Somehow, if it is the latter, one gets the feeling that move has been played out in so many other movies - we must get our man. But perhaps her motivation is immaterial. Since we know so little about our main character - just that she is a loner with apparently no friends or family - the main thread is simply Finding bin Laden. Simple and to the point.So. If we remove the relative recency of 9/11/2001 from the equation, this is simply another action movie. Lots of explosions, Navy SEALS, blood and guts, political intrigue, and so on. But we can't remove that from the equation, can we? Many of us were alive and kicking in 2001 and remember this all too well, so it's a little different from watching an old Hollywood movie about the Second World War.It is implied, very subtly, that information gleaned from detainees leads, obliquely, to the capture of bin Laden, but this was never the case. People say all kinds of crazy things under extreme duress. Again, I stress that this is fictitious based on true events; liberties have understandably been taken with plot elements.As I was leaving the theater, I had some questions to face: Did I see what I expected? Well, I knew the ending, so yes, I suppose I did. But was it truly a great movie? I don't think so, no. I think it glorified - to the consternation of the US government itself - many aspects of our operations overseas that we'd rather not have glorified. The movie made us look great to the win-at-all-costs populace and look worse in the eyes of the international community. And, to be clear, this isn't a political statement, this review: President Bush is hardly mentioned, and when President Obama is shown on screen, he's declaring that America does not torture - while a room of CIA operatives who do just that watch, idly.Zero Dark Thirty is a good film. Kathryn Bigelow's earlier The Hurt Locker was much more entertaining and better crafted; this one is not as well directed, as it feels like a cookie-cutter action/political thriller with a dash of topicality thrown in for spice.",6,21,44,20 January 2013
Crazy Heart," Bridges, Gyllenhaal connect
","Crazy Heart, a sentimental look at an aging country singer just trying to git along, is richly rendered, immersing the viewer into a cigarette- smoke-laced, beer-soaked landscape of podunk bars and whiskey jars. Galvanized by an Oscar-winning performance by Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, the world-weary crooner who's seen better days, the movie is a few notches above the standard rags-to-riches story (particularly because there are hardly any riches), with a finale that's both understandable and unpredictable. Jeff Bridges is a crusty, cranky old drunk here, sort of exactly like the broken-down piece of meat that Mickey Rourke was in The Wrestler. And like Randy the Ram, Bad Blake has a run-in with a younger woman; in this case, she's younger than Marisa Tomei was to Rourke. She's Jean Craddock, a local newspaper reporter, played by the always effervescent Maggie Gyllenhaal (who's terrific here). Like Tomei's character, Craddock has a kid and has weathered tough relationships. (It's set in the Southwest, where movie womenfolk seem to make multiple bad relationship decisions.) Jean falls for the oddly endearing Bad, and a long-distance relationship is born.Bridges is one of those actors who seems just plain awesome in everything. I mean, the man's fun to watch, whether he's The Dude, The President, the bad guy in The Vanishing, a lounge singer, even a comic- book villain. His effortless charisma carries even the most lightweight of movies, and perhaps that's something that's worked against him over the course of his career. Crazy Heart was his fifth nomination and his first win, so it's not as if he's never been recognized, but because he's so good at disappearing into roles and because he takes the crap movies along with the meaty ones, maybe Hollywood's been taking him for granted. Oh, but not now. Bridges' Bad Blake is both unbelievably strong and weak, a man beholden to the bottle but desperate for love. Against his better instincts, honed over a very long middling career, he falls for Jean and her little boy in return.The movie could have taken a few shortcuts and called it a day, and it didn't, and for that it deserves a lot of respect. Colin Farrell plays a singer who got his start from Blake years ago and is trying to repay the favor. A lesser movie might show Blake all bitter about the younger man's success, but it's not so here. A lesser movie might also show anger and resentment from ol' Bad Blake, just trying to keep on keepin' on, only to culminate in a not-at-all-shocking concert that somehow saves his career, but this one doesn't do that, either.I think one of my favorite aspects, though, is how well the two leads played off each other. Maggie Gyllenhaal is 33 years old, and Bridges is 61, but you'd never know it watching the two of them together. Oh, sure, he does present as an older man, but not almost 30 years older. Their connection is palpably strong and a wonder to behold.It also helps a lot that the songs – some performed by Bridges and Farrell themselves – are real toe-tappers, excellent – pardon the pun – stage setters. Whether Blake's playing in a bowling alley or before 12,000 fans as an opening act, he and his tunes are genuine country, solid American entertainment.Blake, like Rourke's Ram, is not an entirely sympathetic man; he's not even a man who's made bad decisions in the past and suddenly begins to make good ones. He's a good man, yes, but trapped by a device of his own design. It's not even a certainty, over the course of the movie, whether he will come out on top in the end – or whether he deserves to. And that's a testament to both Bridges' tremendous, career-defining work and to a top-notch script by director Scott Cooper, who adapted Thomas Cobb's novel.",9,3,4,6 September 2010
War of the Worlds," Misses the mark; an unfortunate Spielberg failure
","Like the giant tripod robots from hell that invade Earth, War of the Worlds is shaky and collapses easily under its own weight. Sure, the effects are typically extraordinary for a Spielberg film, but the invasion itself is illogical and the scenes in which the human characters interact with each other fall flatter than the buildings that the robots stomp.A freakish lightning storm knocks out all power, including cell phones and automobiles. This shouldn't have been much of a shock to anyone, since apparently every news report leading up to the storm discussed electromagnetic pulses in other parts of the world that... knocked out all power. I guess that might have been a comment on how Americans don't pay much attention to world events. As the local denizens scratch their heads in consternation and frustration, giant machines rise up from underground and then obliterate everyone in their paths. Madness ensues.We see all of this death and destruction through the eyes of Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his kids Robbie and Rachel (Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning, respectively). Robbie's a typical sullen teenager, veering between responsible older brother and impudent jerk. Unsurprisingly, he doesn't have a strong relationship with his father, and neither does Rachel. The kids have been conveniently dropped off for the weekend by their very-pregnant mom (the seldom-seen Miranda Otto), all the better for them all to potentially reunite at the end of the movie.Much of the movie involves ducking and running and running some more, and mobs of angry people who resemble zombies without the cold logic, and tentacles, and aliens, and about a zillion shocked looks on Mr. Cruise's face. That's about it. Run, run, take a breath, run some more, peek around a corner. It goes on like this for a while, during which time we see humans alternately being vaporized or eviscerated. In fact, the violence is pretty intense, and I wonder what had to be cut in order for the film to attain a PG-13 rating.The scariest movies are the ones that have at least a strong hint of realism - the audience, in other words, must feel as if what is happening on screen could definitely happen to them. And it's easy to imagine the events in War of the Worlds happening. Oh, perhaps not a full-on alien invasion, but a gigantic catastrophe of some stripe. That's why Independence Day was so popular, and it's also why Close Encounters of the Third Kind was so special.Of course, Spielberg was responsible for Close Encounters, but this one doesn't approach the magic of the earlier film. At least with Close Encounters, we had a vague idea of why we were being visited; here, although we know they're here to kill us all, we don't know why, exactly. And how is it that giant machines could be buried underground for millions of years without anyone knowing? Surely we have the necessary equipment to detect giant metal.While the effects are a huge credit to the movie - and ultimately save it - the script and the acting are two major debits, particularly Cruise and Fanning. Cruise normally plays characters who are the Smartest Guys in the Room, exuding coolness at all times. Ray's not a smart guy. He's an idiot and an incredibly bad father, as he seems to have a knack of putting his kids in danger (although he gets better at that as the movie progresses). Unfortunately, Cruise simply doesn't have the range to play an idiot; Ray comes off as just an obnoxious and selfish. Indeed, he spends much of the movie shocked, shocked at what's going on - which would be anyone's natural reaction, of course, but this movie needed a hero of some sort, kind of like Dennis Quaid in the similarly themed The Day after Tomorrow.Once upon a time, Fanning was cute and talented. She's all of 11 years old now, and she's neither cute nor talented. True, her character spends much of the movie fleeing in terror or screaming her head off, but any actress could have done that. Rachel is far too broadly written, and inconsistently so; sometimes she's precocious, offering Ray advice on dealing with Robbie, and other times she's dumber than your average 10 year old.Why couldn't this movie have been better? Spielberg and Cruise worked very well on Minority Report, and Spielberg's gone the aliens route before with E.T. and Close Encounters, so why did this one fail? I don't think it's unreasonable to expect their collaborations to be pretty good, given their track records, and War of the Worlds simply misses the mark. The action scenes are very intense, almost draining the audience of emotion, but the scenes with actual dialog are terribly shallow and predictable, not to mention unintentionally funny.",5,3,6,29 June 2005
12 Years a Slave," Emotionally draining and worth it
","12 years a Slave, an unflinching account of a free black man in the antebellum North who is abducted and sold into slavery in the Deep South, is a brilliant adaptation, a real work of art by auteur Steve McQueen. It's brutally forthcoming and neither panders to its audience nor glosses over the evil that men (and women) do. It features an transcendent performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor as the lead, nearly matched by Michael Fassbender, as an exceptionally cruel slaveowner.The story opens in Saratoga Springs, New York. Solomon Northrup (Ejiofor) has just seen his wife and two children off on a trip. While walking across the town square, Solomon meets a couple of men who wish for Solomon to play violin for their circus. He travels with them down to Washington, DC and wines and dines with the gentlemen in celebration of Solomon's contribution to the entertainment. But Solomon becomes ill and is put to bed by the men; in the morning, he finds himself in a slave pen, unable to produce papers that would prove him to be a free man.Solomon is acquired by a slave trader named, ironically, Freeman (Paul Giamatti), who in turns sells Solomon and others to a landowner named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) down in Georgia. Solomon's name is now Platt, and his odyssey proceeds through several owners, some meaner than others, but none quite capable for seeing him as the human being he is. Solomon witnesses many evils, including torture, rape, and murder for even the smallest slights against white people and finds that even to survive he cannot count on any help, inside or out.This is not an easy movie to watch. It's not just about shining a light on of the most morally deplorable times in our nation's brief history; it's about getting inside the head of a trapped man, a man desperate to return to his loving family but beset on all sides by incoherent rage and inhumanity. As Solomon himself puts it, 'I don't want to survive. I want to live.'Ejiofor is terrific. When Solomon feels pain, physical or emotional, we feel his pain as well, through Ejiofor's heart-breaking, commanding performance. Solomon's attitude transforms him from a this-must-be-a- mistake nonbeliever trying to convince people he is indeed a legally free man to a defiant, determined, and desperate sojourner. It's a remarkable piece of work by Ejiofor, who had his first break into movies with Steven Spielberg's Amistad - also with slavery as its main theme.McQueen has assembled a profoundly talented cast to back him up. As the worst villain in the lot, Fassbender (as slaveowner Epps) is more than just convincing - you half expect to learn that Fassbender is a true Southern boy rather than being German born - he is also spellbinding as the horrid Epps, a man even nastier than Leonardo DiCaprio's vaunted Calvin Candie from Django Unchained. Candie was a smirking frat boy compared with Edwin Epps, a man who delights in using his slaves for whatever he wishes, punishing them when they don't pick enough in his cotton fields, favoring one as a plaything even over his own wife (Sarah Paulson). One aspect I really liked about this movie was that it never paints any white person as the savior of the black protagonist. Never. How many movies have we seen about slavery and civil rights in which some white person deigns to help the black people and is thus their hero? It's not so here. The closest is Cumberbatch's Ford, but even then the landowner would rather save his skin than form a connection with Solomon (or hear that Solomon is actually a free man). There is no help to be found from kindly white folks here. (Aside - okay, there is, right near the end, but it's apparently true to Solomon's experiences and does not make up for the years of agony that Solomon experienced before running into said white person by chance.) A lesser movie may have tried to shoehorn in a ray of hope for Solomon Northrup in a half-baked attempt to reach a wider audience, but thankfully that didn't happen here. This isn't a popcorn movie, and it's probably not a date movie. It's intellectual and brutish, realistic, believable, painful, and astonishing. It's clearly one of the best of the year and of the careers of McQueen, Ejiofor, and Fassbender.",9,4,7,18 January 2014
30 Days of Night," Not enough gratuitous violence and no nudity
","30 Days of Night is a standard vampires-attacking-a-remote-town movie with the gimmick of the far-northern Alaskan setting that provides the condition of the title. See, because vampires can't exist in direct sunlight - bet you didn't know that - so thirty consecutive days without sunlight would be like heaven to them. But that's about it as far as originality for this by-the-numbers gorefest, although the thick arched eyebrows of Josh Hartnett provide some measure of entertainment.Barrow, Alaska is the northernmost point in the United States, and as previously noted in Insomnia, that area of the world is plunged into darkness for an entire month of every year. This is useful for the purposes of the story here, because it provides an deadline for the denouement - the vampires have to be out of there before the sun rises again. So our intrepid hero and his motley gang of scruffy, bundled-up citizens have a full month to deal with their vampire infestation.Sheriff Eben Oleson (Hartnett) is the small-town Johnny Law whom everyone knows and likes, although he keeps his feelings close inside, as most squinty-eyed, jut-jawed heroes do. On the last day of actual sunlight, he's busy making sure everyone's doing okay and is prepared for the coming darkness. Then he runs into a weird man known only as The Stranger (Ben Foster) who obliquely warns everyone that 'they' are coming that evening, when night falls. Who are they? Superstrong vampires, that's who, and don't think they'll stop until they consume every last drop of your blood, or turn you into one of them. (The last part didn't make a lot of sense to me - why create someone who'll just be competition for food?) No hero is complete without some love interest, so we get Stella (Melissa George), Eben's ex-wife. They're attempting a separation, but naturally Stella - through hopelessly contrived events - is unable to depart the town before the last plane leaves. (How come no flights can arrive or depart the airport when it's dark out? The town has electricity. Maybe they can, but the plot wouldn't permit it.) So she and Eben are stuck together, arguing over who gets to save the town. Seriously. On more than one occasion, Stella says, 'I'm coming with you!' - no way she's gonna let him do it alone! - and most of the time Eben overrules her, but not always, because he's a Thoughtful Hero as well.And to underscore Eben's emotional ties to the community, we're also introduced to his kid brother Jake, who looks to be young enough to be Eben's son. True to the genre, Jake desperately seeks the approval of his successful (to a point) older brother, and he tries to save the town as well. But no, he's not old enough, and Eben is responsible for him, and darned if some kid's gonna be the hero instead of him! So there's that.The movie leans rather heavily on its setting to move the plot along; the special effects are rather ho-hum, and the acting is weak. And it's not that Hartnett can't act - he's actually developing into quite the fine thesp - but here he's just sort of drifting along like a windblown snowpile. George is cute and perky and occasionally serious, but she too isn't quite up to the task. And that's perfectly okay if your leading man is charismatic or if the special effects wow the audience so much that they don't notice the wooden performances, but here that's not the case. You wind up turning your eyes to the gore that you'd expect to see in a vampire movie, but the gore isn't even especially interesting or vicious. Some scenes are disturbing, though; turns out the only way to kill a vampire is by beheading it, as guns apparently have little effect on them. Which doesn't stop at least one suicidal maniac from shotgunning several bloodsuckers in order to give his fellow humans some cover.Bottom line: Good, interesting concept, dreary execution. The movie's based on a series of graphic novels, and my assumption is that the novels themselves had more character and pizazz on the page than this movie does on the screen.",6,1,2,17 March 2008
Wedding Crashers," Smashing!
","Wedding crashers, about two guys who invite themselves to weddings to hook up with women, is crude, filthy raunch. I loved it! There's nothing more beautiful and romantic than taking the maid of honor to bed during the reception. But I digress.Thanks in no small part to the excellent on-screen chemistry of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, the movie is a few notches above typical lowest-common-denominator fare. Oh, let's be honest - Pride and Prejudice, this ain't. But in its own idiom, Wedding Crashers is just plain good laugh out loud comedy.So this is what John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) do. They get into their nice suits and crash weddings AND receptions. They cozy up to the hot guests, make balloon animals, dance, flirt, and eventually wind up with someone. And the next day or weekend, they do it again. Then one day John falls for his mark, Claire (Rachel McAdams), the daughter of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken). Oops; in violation of all of their rules of wedding crashing, the boys spend the weekend with the secretary and his upper-crust family. Claire's engaged to be engaged to Sack, who's thoroughly obnoxious and creepy. You know, just in case you thought she'd have to really choose between him and John, who's, well, Owen Wilson.Also thrown into the mix are Claire's younger sister Gloria, who has the hots for Jeremy - and who may or may not be a virgin; her brother Todd, a bitter, repressed artist; her mom, played by the usually prim Jane Seymour, who has the hots for Jeremy, too; a gramma, and a wise and all knowing butler. It's madcap mayhem, I tell you! Often, this type of chaotic, door-slamming comedy doesn't work in American films, but Wlson and Vaughn are talented enough to pull it off. And it helps that the movie is well written (by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher), with plenty of one liners and running gags.Sure, it's a tad predictable (gee, do you think true love will win?), but who cares? It's loads of fun, with some fantastically hysterical scenes.",7,1,1,24 January 2006
Ice Age," A sheer, smooth slice of comic ice
","In Ice Age, a wooly mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano); a dull-witted, chatty sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), and a fierce saber-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) join to bring a lost human infant back to his father. What peril over yon hill awaits these merry travelers?Manny is the linchpin of the trio. He's a lone mammoth, staying put when all others of his kind (as well as of any other kind) begin their yearly migration to a more arid climate. Manny is morose and a little bitter, but this is quickly recognized as a facade for a warmhearted mammal. He initially wants to stay a lone mammoth, but he's soon joined by the ever-jabbering Sid, who's a little short on both brain and brawn power. When a baby human is left behind by his dying mother, Sid convinces the immovable Manny to help transport the tyke back to his family.The two are joined by Diego, a saber-tooth tiger who was in on the attack on the family and tribe of the young human. Diego's been ordered to retrieve the baby by the head tiger, who wants to do all sorts of nasty and unspeakable things to the infant. Diego's plan is to ingratiate himself with Sid and Manny, offering to take them to the area where they can meet up with the human tribe. Which is fine with Manny, who just wants to be rid of the kid - and Sid.Ice Age, then, is a good old-fashioned buddy pic. The three disparate animals, each outcast in very subtle ways, form a bond that has a common goal. Along the way, they face dangers more of the nature type than of the predator type, and each saves and is saved. But this isn't a movie about great moral lessons; it's a damn hilarious laugh-a-minute cartoon. It's aimed at kids, of course, although the style of animation (it looks a little closer to Toy Story than, say, Looney Toons) can be appreciated by adults, too. But what makes this such a cool movie is that the writing and the timing of the humor - and it's heavy into physical comedy - are impeccable. Sure, it's easier to do this with animation than with live action, but any movie at which I can laugh out loud, unprompted, at a near-constant rate is a surefire winner. Of course, at this point most kids have seen this - pardon me for being one of the last - but if you can still spot it in the theater, please do go.",7,0,2,29 May 2002
The Last King of Scotland," Crazy King is worthy heir to throne
","Supposedly, Idi Amin's official, obviously self-awarded title was 'His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea, and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular.' I note this in case you're on the fence as to whether the Ugandan dictator (sorry, president) was indeed a madman.Amin was the 'people's choice' leader of the central-African nation Uganda from 1971 to 1979, a reign marred by mass murders, cannibalism, and generally rude behavior on the part of the Fearless Leader toward, well, anyone not him. In other words, not a particularly fun time to be a Ugandan, or to visit Uganda.In the Last King of Scotland, Amin is played by Forest Whitaker, who turns in an Oscar-winning performance as the unhinged leader; it is a singularly magnificent exhibition, a prime example of an actor simply disappearing into a role. Gone is the goofy persona from Good Morning, Vietnam, or the morose hit-man from Diary of a Hit-man; Whitaker is finally at center stage. And where you might expect some actors to ham things up a bit, playing a larger-than-life character, Whitaker comes across as honest and eminently believable. His Amin believes in Uganda, wants to see it prosper, but he's drawn by the centralized power and damaged by bouts of insecurity and self-doubt.The story is told through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a young Scotsman who arrived at Uganda hoping to make a difference in the health of Ugandans but who wound up as the personal physician - and a bit more - of the country's unstable president. Garrigan's wide eyed, but not so wide eyed that he can't pause to bed seemingly every woman he lays eyes on. I guess it's the rowdy Scot in him, or something. Anyway, he goes from being a simple country doctor (and making eyes at his colleague's wife) to the presidential palace, where he naturally beds one of Amin's many wives. Nothing good can come of that.Whitaker's superb, of course, but McAvoy seemed a little more transparent as the dictator's right-hand man, his number-one closest adviser. McAvoy's Garrigan seemed to wilt in the presence of Amin, which makes sense until you realize part of the characterization is that Garrigan stands up to Amin; that's why the latter respects the former. Even the way Garrigan and Amin meet seems wrong. There's an accident, and the president needs some mending (sprained hand); meanwhile, a cow that had been hit by a car is braying in pain. No one is doing anything about it, so Garrigan grabs Amin's gun - with all his soldiers around him, mind you - and shoots the cow several times. Problem solved. Only we'd seen no evidence that Garrigan could handle a gun or that he was comfortable around them, and we saw virtually nothing after that that would imply he was the strong, heroic type. And, really, grabbing the new president's gun in full view of his heavily armed soldiers? Doesn't make much sense. Later on, toward the end of the movie, Garrigan makes two ridiculously stupid decisions, too, putting the whole notion of his intelligence to the lie.The biggest problem, though, is that nearly all of Garrigan's problems can be traced to one source - his penis. Yeah, I said it. If he'd kept the thing in his pants, he wouldn't have been in ANY trouble with Amin and would have found it a bit easier to eventually leave the country and return to Scotland.But the bottom line is that this is Whitaker's movie, despite the perspective, and he's so perfect that it's easy to forgive McAvoy's lightweight performance and the plot oddities. The Last King of Scotland is a cut above most historical movies, because even knowing the ending won't spoil the fun. It's also exquisitely photographed (in Uganda itself), and it's riddled with electric scenes.",7,0,0,18 July 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Ferrell good in dramatic role; film is a true winner
","It's been said that when an comedic actor decides to take a turn at dramatic emoting, the results usually veer more toward the cloying, oversentimental than toward the sincere. (Think Bill Murray in The Razor's Edge, not two decades later in Lost in Translation.) And Will Ferrell, star of such wacky fun as Anchorman and Ricky Bobby, wouldn't at first glance seem to be the type of actor with the necessary range to carry a dramatic role. But Ferrell, miraculously pulls it off.Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS auditor who's, shall we say, fastidious. He has routines, you see, from the number of brushstrokes his teeth get to the number of steps he takes to get to his bus stop. A place for everything, and everything in its place. In short, the sort of punctual, detail-oriented soul that an entity such as the IRS love to have on its side.Everything's moving along smoothly for Harold, at least as much as it's moving at all. He lives a solitary life both in and out of work and has no dreams or ambitions. But everything changes when he's brushing his teeth one morning and hears a British woman's voice narrating his actions.Bearing in mind that Harold's well-ordered life could hardly stand even the slightest deviance, it's easy to see how he might completely wig out over this, and that's about what happens. The HR department wants to talk to him, and then he's shuffled over to an in-house doctor (Tom Hulce) and then finally to a college professor (Dustin Hoffman), who tries to figure out the identity of Harold's mysterious novelist through literary means.So now things aren't moving along smoothly, although they are moving along. Until Harold hears some ominous words in his head that suggest that he'll soon be killed off.In the hands of a comedic actor who lacks range, this would have been a maudlin, treacly pile of goo. But because Ferrell is so wonderfully understated, you instantly empathize with Harold. And that's no small feat, considering the wild implausibility of hearing someone's voice in your head; the movie ran the real risk of alienating its audience when it desperately needed it to identify with the main character.Another highlight is the sweet, caring relationship that develops between Harold and Gyllenhaal's character, Ana. Physically, they're an oddball couple - he's quite tall, she's quite not - and personality-wise the two actors seem kind of a mismatch. But although their characters suffer through some necessary awkwardness, the two actors are able to make their union believable and desirable. In other words, they look great together.As Kay Eiffel, the novelist in Harold's head, Emma Thompson brings a coffee-and-cigarettes nihilism to the role; she's supposed to kill Harold off, but she doesn't know quite how to do that; her publisher has sent her an assistant (the always solid Queen Latifah) to encourage things so Eiffel meets her deadline.Thanks to beautiful performances by Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal, an exceptional supporting cast, and a script that doesn't nosedive into oversentimentality but does sprinkle in some genuine laughs, Stranger than Fiction is an exuberant, charming film.",8,0,2,11 November 2006
The Green Mile," Supernatural fantasy not your typical Stephen King tale
","So what we have here is a movie set in a prison in the 1930s involving a group of death-row guards, a childlike supposed child-killer who wants the light left on at night, and a tiny mouse. No, it's not 'Stuart Little' for the taxpaying set, it's the latest movie adapted from a Stephen King story. Specifically, 'The Green Mile' comes from the only King story so far to be presented to the public in serial form; that is, one chapter at a time was published in separate short books.Tom Hanks is Paul Edgecomb, the leader of the guards, already a hardened veteran of the block. His kingdom is The Green Mile, the death-row area of the prison, so named because of the color of the tile that the prisoners must walk on their way to the electric chair. One of Paul's newest prisoners is a massive black man named John Coffey, who seems completely out of place except for his size; Paul immediately senses no violence in the man.The mouse is the pet of the Mile and spends most of his time in the company of one of the block's senior prisoners, Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter). The mouse himself isn't completely relevant to the plot, but his presence does serve to humanize the prisoners and to act as a bookend for the entire story, told in flashback by Paul many years later. There are many subplots, all of them surrounding Paul and his crew as they deal with John Coffey and the other prisoners, but none of them seems incongruous, and that's a major asset to a film like this. Running three hours, it's easy to mix in multiple plot lines, of course, but you don't want your audience falling asleep on you. Frank Darabont, who helmed that other Stephen King prison story ('The Shawshank Redemption'), does an extraordinary job selecting just the right camera angles and keeping the pace of the film consistent. This, along with 'Shawshank,' is a rare bird: a film adapted from a Stephen King story that actually works well on the screen. Most of the King adaptations out there - and there have been a LOT! - have been lackluster and lacking. King's greatest quality as a writer is his exposition and character development, and most films don't have the time or patience to carry that quality over. Both of Darabont's do. As for the cast, there are no slackers. Hanks is gritty and convincing in the lead, and his fine support includes David Morse as a fellow guard and James Cromwell as the prison's warden. All acquit themselves wonderfully, allowing the viewer to be drawn into the story effortlessly.",9,0,0,19 February 2000
The Reader," Unsatisfying execution boosted by Winslet
","The Reader, starring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes and set against the backdrop of the Holocaust, is at times tiresome and plodding, offering a unique plot (boy has affair with older woman, finding out later she was a Nazi guard) and a strong performance by Winslet and very little else. Its main problem seems to be that it simply doesn’t know what it wants to tell the viewer, what lessons it wishes to impart. As a result, its identity shatters into the proverbial million little pieces, each less interesting than the last.Michael Berg (David Kross) is 15 and on the verge of falling under two spells: first, scarlet fever, from which he recovers in a few months, and then Hanna (Winslet), the older woman who helps him when he becomes ill. It is from this latter spell, though, that Michael never recovers; he feels the impact of their short, summer affair until the end of the movie (forty years later).As romances go, it’s pretty sweet for the teen: he gets to sleep with a sexy older woman who desires only one thing (other than his sinewy body, of course): for him to read to her whatever trips his fancy. It’s a symbiotic relationship; he’s happy to have found a kindred spirit and ecstatic - pardon the term - to find an outlet for his hormones. She, on the other hand, is happy for his company and to hear him recite works of classic literature.But as all affairs do, theirs ends abruptly, with nary an explanation, and that’s the last young Michael sees of Hanna, until he’s in law school years later, and as a field trip he’s in the very courtroom where a group of female, ex-Nazi guards is being charged with war crimes. Lo and behold, one of the guards is Hanna! The story is related in flashback through the memories of the adult Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is a fine (ha) actor, of course, but it seems he’s always stuck with these repressed, completely controlled roles. Distant, Michael’s called in the movie, an emotional cipher. Michael attempts, for decades, to come to grips with two dilemmas: why did Hanna leave him, and is her alleged Nazi past true? For me, I didn’t much care about his first dilemma; of course she left him, because she’s like twice his age and he was the clingy, controlling type. I was more concerned with the latter dilemma, because the trailer leads you to believe there’s some dispute about that. But this isn’t a courtroom drama. It’s more of a romance melodrama with serious undertones about the choices we make and the responsibility we marshal. The suggestion is made in the movie that the German people are looking for someone on whom to pin the blame of the Holocaust, and who better than guards following orders? Really, the film has just one thing going for it, although it’s a doozy: Kate Winslet, who electrifies the screen even when she’s not on it. Her vulnerable, conflicted Hanna is nurturing and distant, just as Michael would turn out; we can only guess at her true feelings, but Winslet is so talented that with a mere glance she can turn our perceptions on edge. She is this film, inside and out, and the fact that she also gets naked doesn’t hurt matters.The Reader perhaps overreached its goals, whatever they may be. It admirably tries to give us a main character who is not noble and good of heart in all things, but it fails to give us a solid reason to care about the proceedings other than as if we were being read a tale set in a faraway land in a distant time.",7,4,7,24 January 2009
The Wrestler," Top-notch, exhilarating, jarring, authentic
","In Darren Aronofsky's brilliant character drama The Wrestler, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a down-and-almost-out pro wrestler who grapples with his own mortality and a fear of being alone and desperate. Rourke is phenomenal, delivering a powerful, highly physical performance that will knock your socks off as much as if he'd clotheslined you himself. Rourke's Randy is intrepid, a scarred battle cruiser who desperately needs to be in the ring to survive, a man who's emotions are kept as close to the vest as possible, a man with nothing else going for him other than his time in the spotlight.The Ram, probably an amalgam of several real-life wrestlers (chief among them, Randy 'Macho Man' Savage), is a relic of the 1980s, a man who wistfully counts the scars and cuts on his body and remembers with great fondness his greatest ring moment, a pay-per-view battle against The Ayatollah. But twenty years later, he's wrestling in high-school gymnasiums, barely able to put on a decent show but still basking in any glory he can find. But the gigs hardly pay at all, and more than once The Ram is unable to pay the rent on his mobile home.Meanwhile, two people enter (and reenter) Randy's life. Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) is a stripper at a low-rent club that Randy frequents. Cassidy is just about the only person in the world that Randy can talk to; he's lonely, spending most of his postmatch time either drinking alone or patching up any new wounds. He's treading water; with no life outside of wrestling, he's just trying to make it through the night intact.Reentering Randy's life is his long-estranged daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, who's hated her dad for years after he abandoned the family. Randy, in case you're still not certain, is not meant to be an entirely sympathetic figure; you know why he is how he is, and you do feel bad for him, but you also understand that just about everything that's made him who he is today is due to his own decisions. The Ram is not a victim.Aside from the simple I'm-getting-too-old-for-this angle, there's a serious medical angel that presents itself early in the movie - keep on wrestling, the doctor warns, and you'll likely die in the ring. And to his credit, Randy does attempt to stop his own livelihood, but he quickly - and harshly - realizes how incredibly difficult that is. The real world doesn't want him, The Ram thinks. They only want what's in the ring.Rourke is outstanding, perhaps sparking his own career renaissance, and Tomei is simply terrific as Cassidy. Tomei is a perfect physical fit for the role of the rapidly aging stripper; she's still gorgeous, but there are just enough lines on her face to make her age believable. Tomei continues to make excellent role choices, and she completely knocks this one out of the park. Her Cassidy hurts as much on the inside - and what movie stripper doesn't? - as Randy appears to on the outside, and they have much in common. It's gratifying to see Cassidy's feelings toward Randy evolve throughout the movie.There are also several matches featuring The Ram, one of which should really appeal to wrestling fans: a hardcore match. In this kind of match, literally anything goes - barbed wire, windows, tables, chairs, anything. Yes, we all know that pro wrestling is fake, but it's fake really only in terms of the final outcome, with just a few guidelines worked out between the competitors beforehand (e.g., I'll hit you low, then you leg whip me). And of course these particular matches were staged and scripted, but man did they ever look real. You want to see something scary, check out Randy after the hardcore match, when staples - from a staple gun - are removed from his body.The Wrestler is a gritty, raw look at one man's desire to keep on keepin' on, trying to survive the only way that's still open to him, while trying desperately to connect with someone emotionally as he ages. It's heartwarming but also heart-wrenching, and the somewhat-ambiguous ending is sure to confound people who like their movies to end tidily. It's a masterpiece for Rourke, another tour-de-force for Tomei, and an award-worthy effort for Aronofsky.",9,8,9,30 December 2008
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Fun to watch, just not too provocative
","It's here; it's finally here. As the end of a trilogy, The Battle of the Five Armies doesn't have the emotional impact that The Return of the King, but it's still fine movie-making. The titular battle is a sweeping epic worthy of turned-up speakers and rattling high definition. It's an entertaining film; it just doesn't carry with it that sheen of instant classic, as its predecessors did.The movie picks up where the previous installment, The Desolation of Smaug, left off. Right away, we're helicoptered into dazzling action, as Smaug is attacking the floating village of Lake-town, burning homes and people alike with only revenge upon his intelligent but lizard-like brain. But it's when the monster is slain - not a giveaway, as it occurs so early in the movie - that things really get going. That's because although the Dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) lay claim to the vast treasure, previously guarded by Smaug, beneath the Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, others want to get their beaks wet as well.The refugees of Lake-Town, led by Bard (Luke Evans), had been promised some of the treasure in exchange for harboring the Dwarfs - and now they need it, what with no homes and few possessions and all. Meanwhile, the Elves, led by Thranduil (Lee Pace) wish to reclaim a particular artifact for themselves, as it was reportedly stolen by Dwarfs eons ago in a different battle. Oh, but that's not all. It seems that a new race of Orcs, led by Azog the Defiler, is intent on taking the mountain as a strategic stronghold. And these are no ordinary, mindless Orcs, either. These guys have skills, more than just brute force.Thorin and his crew are in the mountain, looking for the Arkstone (a stone meant for the Dwarven King that makes him even more powerful), when Lake-Town falls. But there be madness in the mountain, madness that everyone in the party can feel is seeping into the skull of Thorin himself. As you might imagine, this makes our hero Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) a little uneasy.And what to make of these new Orcs? It's a situation that both puzzles and worries Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Saruman (Christopher Lee) - yep, all four appear in this movie. And, what's more, what they discover has direct ramifications for the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy to follow. Another connected subplot is the burgeoning romance between Dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) and Elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), with protective Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) looking on concernedly, although it was not part of Tolkien's original work.So why isn't this a stunning spectacle on par of the LOTR movies? Because of a lack of emotional punch. The Lord of the Rings books were long and detailed, and director Peter Jackson slipped as much detail into the movies as possible. Much of the journey that the Fellowship undertook was seen on screen, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters and really empathize with them. There were also dynamics within the group (Gimli/Legolas, Frodo/Sam, Boromir/Aragorn) that are missing here. Really, many of the Dwarfs are interchangeable - as their similar-sounding names indicate - and the only real dynamics are between Thorin and Bilbo and between Thorin and Everyone Else. A lack of empathy for the Dwarfs' plight makes them less protagonists and more just regular participants in the sweeping plot.To be sure, the battle is a terrific scene. Dwarfs, Elves, Men, Orcs, perhaps something else that may not have been in the original book - they all come together in close hand-to-hand combat. For some, it's a fight to reclaim treasure; for others, it's a fight to gain the upper hand in a larger, upcoming war. And for still others, the fate of the whole of Middle-earth rests in who takes the mountain. Knowing the ultimate resolution to the battle doesn't diminish one's appreciation of it, either.And when the movie does end, the final scene is a fitting coda. It doesn't pack the punch of the end of Return of the King, and couldn't - because readers know already of the events following The Hobbit and leading up to The Fellowship of the Ring. Jackson does a fine job with the tale, even if The Hobbit was just one short book and even if he had to invent characters (Tauriel). He did the best with what he had, and he was the right choice to direct the trilogy all along. Even his doppleganger, Guillermo del Toro, wouldn't have given us as much of a thrill ride.",7,1,4,21 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not compelling
","Watching the final part of the prequel trilogy gives one a real sense of closure, which is very good indeed, but also a real sense of emptiness, which isn't so good. I don't mean just an empty feeling because there are no more Star Wars films on the horizon, I mean empty as in sadly unfulfilling. If Star Wars Episode III were a candy bar, it wouldn't be Snickers.Going into the theater, you already have a sense of what'll be in the movie, because you know how Episode IV (aka Star Wars) began. So you know which characters from Episodes I and II won't make it to the end of III, you know what'll happen to the Jedi Council, and you know who turns evil and gets to wear a totally badass helmet.Sometimes being familiar with characters (perhaps intimately) is a good thing, because it makes it all the easier for one to root for them. On the other hand, knowing what's going to happen - and how things will end - can also be a debit, because then the viewer has a certain set of expectations that he or she feels should be met, expectations that when not met contribute to feelings of disappointment and disillusionment.Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), pupil to Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) torn between aiding the Jedi Council and Chancellor Palpatine while war rages on against Darth Sidious, Count Dooku, General Grievous, and the rest of the merry men of evil. Meanwhile, his wife Padme (Natalie Portman) can see her husband only in secret, lest knowledge of the union between a Jedi and a senator become known.Even though there are plenty of explosions, stunts, and general mayhem, the movie is really about the moral failings of man: Should Anakin stay on the true path as the Chosen One, fighting for good along with the other Jedi Knights? Or should he succumb to the Dark Side and help those he loves? Can he be selfish and selfless at the same time? Since he is such a young warrior, it seems, he is easily manipulated, but the catch is that he knows he's being manipulated by someone. Anakin's problem is that he doesn't know who is doing the manipulation, and he suddenly doesn't know whom to trust. Trust is a central theme to the story: Anakin's trust of the Council, of Obi-Wan, and of Padme; the Council's trust of Anakin and Palpatine; Padme's trust of Anakin. Their relationships offer an interesting juxtaposition with the violence and action surrounding them.With the first two episodes of the prequels, the viewer really didn't know what to expect. We knew where Star Wars began, of course, and we knew these three movies would lead us to it, but we didn't know how. What adventures would happen along the way? But with the third movie, less was left unknown before the movie even began. I knew what was going to happen, so I was counting on George Lucas to perhaps throw me a few curveballs to keep me off balance - and, of course, wow me with his special effects wizardry.My problem with the third episode was that it was simply there; it's almost as if it were a bridge to the fourth episode, rather than being a standalone episode itself. I wasn't really excited by this movie, which is in itself a major disappointment. I wasn't shocked, amazed, or surprised, and that's a real shame. True, it's great to see familiar characters (including late in the movie who shows up in the next episodes), and it's fun to see them do battle against their sworn enemies. It's fascinating to watch Anakin turn from callow youth to diabolic fiend bent on ruling the galaxy. But I knew the end result, and there was nothing compelling about the storyline.On the plus side, the acting by Christensen and Portman - especially in their shared scenes - has dramatically improved, although there are still moments when Christensen seems like he's only four lessons into a ten-lesson acting course. McGregor channels the late Alec Guiness; one can easily see how he becomes the old man we see in Episode IV.Even at nearly two and a half hours, the movie is fairly well paced, without some of the lulls that plagued the first two prequels. And the effects are certainly believable, not to mention those employed to animate Yoda and other nonhuman characters. The hand-to-hand fighting scenes are wonderful to behold, always credible.But the movie just doesn't grab you the way it should. It's the final movie in the series; we won't see another one. It should grab the viewer by the ears and shake him a bit. Instead, George Lucas' epic series finally comes to a close not with a bang-pop-zowie of an exploding Death Star but with the slight whimper of a Jedi sliced in two by a light saber.",6,4,7,25 May 2005
Bring It On," Cheer we go again
","Bring It On is the story of a championship-caliber high-school cheerleading squad in San Diego that learns some of its most popular cheers have been swiped from a less-privileged school in Los Angeles. The story centers around Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst, all grown up from Interview with the Vampire), who is named as captain of the squad at the outset of the movie, displacing the outgoing, aggressive Big Red (Lindsey Sloane).
Torrance is a forthright person, loyal to the cheerleading squad, full of pep and vigor, and unwilling to cheat to get her way. On her first day as the squad captain, one of the cheerleaders is injured - injured enough to miss any and all future practices, games, and tournaments. Torrance and her crew audition a few students - male and female, and some who aren't old enough to be in high school - and all appears to be lost until Missy Pantone, the stereotypical new-kid-in-school-who's-also-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks, comes along.After much ado and some obvious snobbery on the part of her fellow cheerleaders, Torrance accepts Missy. There's some reluctance on both parts. But before too long, Torrance learns (through Missy) that the cheers that have done so well for the squad for so long have been swiped from a tougher school in LA, one that's perpetually underfunded (conveniently). Oh, and Torrance is also slowly falling for Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford). Oh the complications of being a blonde cheerleader in San Diego! (Hold your cynicism, please!)The thing is, according to the other cheerleaders, swiping cheers is standard operating procedure, so Torrance's ethics are overruled. But then when it comes time for the regional cheerleader tournament (yes, such a beast exists, albeit only in captivity!), they find that yet another squad has duplicated some of their own cheers. The San Diego squad does their own and is reprimanded by the judges.Ok, there's your plot. Fill in the rest as you will. This ain't Shakespeare, folks. Ya gets what ya pays when you see this movie. Don't expect anything all that wonderful. Dunst, however, is a lot of fun as Torrance, and Bradford is her equal as her erstwhile love interest. I will sheepishly admit to laughing out loud at some of the lines in the movie, but overall it wasn't all that impressive. This might be a good movie to watch if you're doing something else, that is, as background material. As cheerleader movies go, it could have been worse (like Satan's Cheerleaders, from 1977).",5,0,1,28 February 2001
Inception," Visually, a little flat; good plot construction and not predictable
","Inception, about the business of invading dreams and stealing secrets, is overbaked, complicated, and tough to endure in spots. It's crippled by overexplaining itself and by changing the rules it sets out for itself when convenient to the plot. Still, a strong supporting cast (behind the vapid Leonardo Dicaprio) helps considerably.Dicaprio plays Cobb, a man whose job it is to invade people's dreams and steal their secrets. (It stands to reason that he's also The Very Best at this.) Cobb operates outside of the United States because of a terrible incident in his past, and he's been looking for a way back without facing any negative consequences. A Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe) has a job for him, with a proposal: if Cobb is successful, Saito will have his longstanding charges dropped with the proverbial one phone call. But, of course, there's a catch: rather than having Cobb steal an idea from their victim, Saito wants him to plant one, an act known as 'inception,' an act that is deemed nigh near impossible to accomplish.Cobb assembles his team: his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Eames (Tom Hardy), the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao). Their mission: enter the dream of the heir of a major corporation and plant the idea that he wants to strike out on his own rather than take over the company when his nearly dead dad kicks the bucket.As with most Christopher Nolan movies, this one takes some careful scrutiny. It's not that the plot is convoluted, precisely, it's more that there's not only a lot of things going on in rapid-fire motion, and the entire movie is set against the backdrop of an area that virtually no one knows anything about: dreams. Because of the unfamiliar territory, the filmmakers can do almost anything they want within the movie, within the dream within the movie, and within the dreams within the dream, and so on.Nolan establishes some rules from the start, because his audience naturally would have no idea what they might be (for example, if you die in a dream, you wake up; in order to come out before the dream is up without dying, you need to fall somehow). Then, over the next couple of hours, he violates those rules a few times. In other words, the rules are X, but because of this situation in which we now find ourselves, all bets are off. It's kind of easy to write your way out of plot predicaments when you can change the rules at any time and for any reason.This is an issue that plagued Dicaprio's last movie, Shutter Island, a movie that depended on the audience being able to suspend disbelief. That's crucial here as well, but the nature of what we're supposed to disbelieve keeps changing. It's tough to completely respect a movie that needs to move its own goalposts.The cast isn't terrible, but it's largely lost under a sea of story intricacies, wild CGI, and a lot of blaring music. This is a minor complaint, honestly, but there were multiple scenes in which characters were speaking to one another in normal tones while the movie's soundtrack was ratcheted up to 11, thus rendering the dialog completely indecipherable. For a movie that's so highly dependent on plot, this was irritating and really inexcusable.But back to the cast. Both Gordon-Levitt and Page seemed out of place, in way over their heads. Gordon-Levitt's character probably should have been played by someone more skillful, like Mark Ruffalo or James Franco; Page looked like she just wandered onto the set of another of her Comcast commercials, and she's not yet been able to shed her Juno MacGuff persona. Page, like the rest of the cast, is game but is ultimately along for the ride, nothing more. Also on hand is Marion Cotillard as Cobb's dead wife who appears to him in dreams as sort of a projection, and that's where the weirdness begins; he's defensively locked his memory of her in his subconscious, so of course she pops up every time he goes into someone else's dream. That can be a bit of a drag.I'm still firmly in the camp that believes Leonardo Dicaprio often confuses earnestness with good acting. (I might be the only person in this camp, but the smores are to die for.) I know there are plenty of people who think he's the bee's knees when it comes to passionate performances, but I just feel like he's stretching further than he can reach as an actor. He seems sincere here, yes, but not entirely believable in the role. For some reason, I think a more burned-out- looking actor would have been better, even Jeff Bridges – despite the age difference – because he would lend a lot of gravitas to a pretty demanding role.As always, I was amazed and impressed by the imagination of Christopher Nolan (who also scripted), but I was largely disappointed by the movie, particularly its denouement. There's much to see and soak in, and it's true that overthinking the movie will lead you to really dislike it (or stare at it, mouth agape), but often it's just too much seriousness and not enough awe and wonder.",6,3,12,17 July 2010
WALL·E," A few notches below earlier Pixars
","I wish I could say that this movie was on par with earlier Pixar movies, but I just can't. The animation isn't bad, it's just that unlike the undersea world in Finding Memo or the toy chest in Toy Story, there's just nothing pretty to look at for large chunks of time. And because the main characters are robots who don't exactly speak English well, the movie depends rather heavily on two things: the visual landscape and the nonlinguistic communication of the metal duo. As a result, the movie isn't quite as charming or self-effacing as its predecessors, but it's still amiable and heartwarming when it needs to be.WALL-E is the last remaining robot on Earth. See, the place got so polluted that everyone had to zoom off to ships in outer space just to survive; the plan is to let the WALL-E units compact and store all the garbage, and when life can be sustainable again, the humans will return. This was 700 years ago. And every day, WALL-E compacts trash (all the other units have broken down), blissfully un-self-aware. The humans send down probes to determine if life can return to the planet, and that's when our WALL-E meets EVE, who's quite a bit more advanced and intelligent than WALL-E.WALL-E is adorable. He looks quite a bit like Johnny 5 from the Short Circuit films, and he's about as smart and curious. As he collects and compacts trash, he grabs various items that seem interesting to him and stores them in his storage crate. But although he's been at it for centuries, his world's turned upside down when Eve the probe arrives on Earth in search of plant life. Wouldn't you know it, our inquisitive little toaster falls in love at first sight with the sleek Eve, who looks sort of like a giant toe (her visor would be the toe nail - try to stay with me on this).On Earth, although the atmosphere is lighthearted and full of hope, the scenery (and hence the overall look and feel of the movie) is downbeat and gloomy; everything's washed out in a sea of brown and gray. The planet's a wasteland, you see, along the lines of the postapocalyptic horror of Mad Max.But once we leave the planet and land on the ship Avion, things perk up. Here, everything's red or blue (the colors in the BuyNLarge logo - that's the conglomerate that owned, like, everything on the planet and that now owns and operates the deep-space ships. You should see these places - the whole idea is that the humans will never have to lift a finger. Robots wake them up. They're dumped onto these motorized recliners that whisk them everywhere. They shop and drink milkshakes from their recliners. They literally never move. So of course they're all tremendously overweight.Can WALL-E and Eve help bring life back to Earth? It's a Disney/Pixar film, so you probably already know the answer, and if you thought about it for a second, you could probably map out how the movie would shake out. But one thing you might not realize is that for a G-rated movie, there's a lot of tense, scary-toned scenes. There are several moments when you're led to believe something incredibly awful has happened to WALL-E, and unlike in its cartoon progenitors there's a perceptible delay before it's revealed he's okay - long enough for you to wonder if, indeed, he is.So I was a little surprised to find out this was a G-rated movie. Aside from the desolate, acrid, lifeless landscape of Earth, there are plenty of robot-in-peril scenes, sequences that seem more action-movie-like than cartoonish. This is partly because Pixar's animation is so advanced now that WALL-E looks and behaves exactly as you'd expect a robot in real life would. Which brought me to this question: Why even make an animated movie about robots? It's not as if you're giving human qualities to, say, a fish or a stuffed animal; you're anthropomorphizing something that's already been given human qualities.In short, WALL-E lacked the amazing, imaginative premise and theme that earlier classics had. I wasn't bowled over by the animation, and I just wasn't terribly impressed with the execution. WALL-E is not a bad movie by any means, but it suffers by comparison with its own ancestors. In the end, it's done in by its subject matter (not conducive to gorgeous animation), its setting (vast, colorless), and its penchant for robot-in-peril scenes.",6,10,24,28 June 2008
The Good Shepherd," Matt Damon is just not a leading man. No veritas.
","Robert DeNiro's fictionalized account of the creation and early history of the CIA is intelligent and well intentioned, with superb casting. Its most prominent debit is in the casting of Matt Damon as its lead, Edward Wilson, the young man at the crux of the genesis of the counterintelligence agency.The quiet, unassuming Wilson is a straight-arrow Yale student, part of America's upper crust, who vows to do good in the world after his father commits suicide, thus making him an easy recruit for a US general (DeNiro) who is planning a new, covert intelligence service after World War II. Wilson is stationed in London, and his cipherlike demeanor allows him to run counterintelligence for the US there, as German and Russian spies (and others) jockey for position in postwar England.The movie is bookended by the leadup to the infamous Bay of Pigs incident in 1961. There has been a leak on the US side, alerting Fidel Castro to the upcoming invasion, and Wilson must determine the source of the leak. All he has to go by is a hidden-camera film and some murky audio; he doesn't know where the film was recorded, and he doesn't know who the speakers on the audio are.As 1961 Wilson - by now, a seasoned espionage agent - tries to suss out what has happened, we flash back many times to his own early beginnings, how he met a young woman named Clover Russell (Angelina Jolie), how he was found by Phillip Allen (William Hurt) by way of the notorious (if it actually exists) Skull and Bones society at Yale, and how the relationship between Wilson and his son Edward, Jr., progresses over the years, as his dad is rarely home (he's gone for the first five years of Junior's life, actually).The movie works not because of Damon but because of the trenchant, complex plot dreamed up by Eric Roth. This is a movie that takes a driving force of a character's personality - i.e., Wilson's patriotism - and turns it around in order to both buoy the character and bring about his downfall. Anyone as single minded as Wilson is in this movie is going to face a rude comeuppance, but at the same time his tenacity at doing the Right Thing for America, his unwavering decency, is held up as a laudable ideal.The problem with Damon is the same one that's followed him throughout his career; he constantly looks unable to provide the panache that these meatier roles demand. In a sense, that's not a terrible thing here, as Wilson's unreadable countenance is perfect for a superspy: does the lack of expression mask myriad possibilities, or does it simply mean there's nothing to be seen? A more competent actor can essay a thousand thoughts without uttering a word, but with Damon one just thought there was't much there to begin with.He's surrounded by a very able cast, though, helping matters considerably. Jolie sparkles in the few scenes in which she appears as Wilson's wife, as do DeNiro, Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Michael Gambon, and Timothy Hutton. Perplexingly cast was the marble-mouthed Eddie Redmayne as Edward Jr., who's as dull-looking and unintelligible as his on screen father is hunky and articulate. It'd be easy to ignore this casting faux pas, but Edward Jr. plays a big role in the final twenty minutes of the movie, sadly.Another caveat: Although the movie covers a couple decades in time, Damon never ages all that realistically. Sure, he has a couple of crow's feet, but that's about it; oh, there's the time where he's inexplicably wearing what appear to be women's eyeglasses. (No, he's not undercover.) It's kind of funny (unintentionally) when you see the senior and junior Edwards near the end of the movie, and Junior looks about as old as his old man. They couldn't even pack a few more pounds on Damon? Give him a paunch, a stoop, anything? No, apparently we're supposed to go by the passage of time to show his aging, although everyone else seems a bit older - and wears it well (see, in particular, Jolie, who's absolutely wonderful, no matter her character's age).The Good Shepherd is a bit too long, although the story itself is well told. A good solid cast and a followable plot make this mostly enjoyable; it loses points for unbelievable casting and the usual so-low-key-he's-almost-invisible performance by Damon.",6,4,8,13 July 2007
Rango," Depp once again proves his range
","Rango is more than just a pleasant, well-conceived kids' film. I'm not even sure kids are the target audience. There really aren't any adorable animals afoot, although there is an obvious Bad Guy and a whimsical Good Guy. But there's a level of delightful sophistication that makes Rango a cut above most of its ilk - and, as a prize, it picked up the Best Animated Feature Oscar, so there's that.Rango (Johnny Depp) is a chameleon. Well, truthfully, we don't know what his name is; he merely adopts the name when he has to. See, our chameleon is really a family pet who finds himself stranded in the middle of the desert, alone for the first time. He wanders into an aptly named town called Dirt, a place that is naturally beset by bad'uns despite a paternal mayor (Ned Beatty). Our friendly chameleon, who has spent his life in a terrarium wishing he could star in a musical (seriously!) finds his acting prowess put to the test. Yes, he must become Rango, the daring gunslinger who has saved other towns in the Old West. It seems Dirt has a problem: little water. I know, if they had water they'd be Mud, right? True, true, but the critters who inhabit the town still need water, apparently, to farm and, you know, exist. Such denizens include lizards, iguanas, moles, mice, armadillos, rabbits, Gila monsters, and tortoises. You know, desert critters. Anyway, the town actually has a bank - a bank in which water resides. Citizens make deposits, withdrawals, and you get the idea. But the supply is running precariously low. Why is that?Rango to the rescue! I won't bore you with how exactly our chameleon susses out the situation, but let's say he takes the bull by the horns, suffers some indignities, proves he's not what he says he is, and maybe wins in the end. After all, it's an animated film that kids are going to be interested in, so don't expect a lot of violence or a detailed plot. It's not important.What is important, and what truly makes this a wonderful film, is Depp. If I didn't know any better - and I don't, really - I would swear he was ad-libbing all of his lines. Depp's patter is rapid, intelligent, witty, and delightful. Often, if an actor improvises and isn't up to it, you'll darn well notice - none of the made-up lines connect with each other or the rest of the movie, jokes fall flat. Hey, actors aren't usually writers as well. But if he or she is good at improv, then you get lines that seem even more natural than the scripted variety. For the record, John Logan wrote the screenplay, and since he was nominated this year for writing Martin Scorsese's Hugo, I think we can assume that the words we hear Depp speak are indeed from the pen of Mr. Logan. Most of them, anyway.Good supporting cast, too, including a creepy, oily turn by Bill Nighy as a rattlesnake; Beatty as the tortoise-mayor (who might remind one of Noah Cross in Chinatown); Isla Fisher as Beans, the nominal love interest who has catatonia as a defense mechanism; and Alfred Molina as a run-over 'dillo. Directing the shenanigans (his first animated feature) is Gore Verbinski, who directed Depp in three Pirates of the Caribbean movies.Kids will like this movie, although maybe those who are fans of shoot- em-up cartoons will take a greater shine to it than those who like love stories, but we're not going to stereotype here. Truth is, Beans is one of the toughest characters in the movie, much more so than poor Rango. In any event, Rango contains some scenes that may frighten small children (scenes involving the rattlesnake Jake, for example), but much more action and comedy than anything else, and even for jaded moviegoers it's a lot of fun to watch.",9,1,1,10 March 2012
The Big Short," Modern horror
","The Big Short is about the great collapse of the American housing market (and subsequently the world economy), and as such doesn't appear to fit the mold of a scary movie. But scary it is, particularly for those folks who lost their jobs, savings, and homes as a result. Odds are pretty good that you or someone you know was directly affected by this avoidable catastrophe.The movie focuses on a few Wall Street guys who figured out years in advance that the housing bubble was going to burst. In the movie, their names are Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), Michael Burry (Christian Bale), Mark Baum (Steve Carell), Charlie Geller (John Magaro), and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock). The script, by director Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, changes the names and some relatively minor details, but everything's based on fact. And since we know how it all turned out (hint: there was a collapse), there isn't much suspense left.And yet the movie succeeds. The casting is great, for one thing – check out Carell as a broker with a strong moral center and some serious anger-management issues. His is a role ripe for overacting, but Carell never goes overboard, doing a perfect slow, slow, slow burn as he grills various money managers about their methods, which aren't pretty.There's also humor, a flavor that's desperately needed when dealing with a real-life tale of misery, don't you think? Injecting a little humor into the situation makes the characters look, well, more like human beings than fine-suited Wall Street fellas. That's not to say that there are no poignant moments: one scene in particular involves Carell's Mark Baum and his wife, played by the always-terrific Marisa Tomei. Finally, several of the characters break the proverbial fourth wall, addressing the audience with asides – some of which involve disclaimers about what exactly in the present scene is 100% true and what's been tweaked a little bit. Believe me, it works.And if that weren't enough to keep the movie wildly entertaining, the script takes time to explain certain relevant financial terms to its audience without being boring or dreary. Terms like CDO, explained by master chef Anthony Bourdain (comparing a CDO to fish that remained unsold at his restaurant at the end of the day), or derivatives, explained by pop star Selena Gomez and economist Richard Thaler. It felt weird understand what they were talking about.But here's the scariest part of it all. The viewer spends a couple of hours following this sordid tale. We see the bad guys, we see the good guys, and we know that if this were fiction, the bad guys would probably get theirs in the end. But it's not, and we know they don't. We know that despite the canary-in-the-mine behavior of these guys, millions of people lost their jobs. And really, none of them were the movers and shakers on Wall Street. That's because when the big banks had bad mortgages that were in danger of defaulting, they packaged them up and sold them to someone else, who did the same thing to someone else, all the way down the line. The poor sap left holding the bag when the bubble burst lost it all, and those who instigated it lost zilch. That's the terrifying part. All of this in concert between Wall Street, its private-sector overseers, the government, and Big Business. They raked in the dough by breaking the law and, even when caught, suffered few consequences themselves. Which makes The Big Short ten times more horrifying than any gorefest movie I've seen.",8,0,0,11 July 2016
The Conjuring," Ain't nothing holy 'bout it - terrifying
","The Conjuring is a blood curdling treat, if you're into movies that spook the bejeezus out of you. Fast-moving, tense, and dark, this is not one of those laughable underwritten suspense movies with more special effects than actual plot. It's the kind of movie that slowly builds for a half hour or so before figuratively unleashing itself upon its audience. In the same vein as 1979's The Amityville Horror, a family moves into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. It's 1971. People have porkchop sideburns and wear loud pants. Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) have five - count 'em, five - daughters and a dog. The house was cheap. It didn't take long for the family to find out they picked the wrong farmhouse to inhabit. Yep, you guessed it, malevolent spirits. Legs are literally pulled in the middle of the night. A smell not unlike rotten eggs comes and goes. Various pieces of furniture, left behind by previous owners, shake and rattle. There's a boarded-up basement. An old music box is found by an even older tree by a deceptively tranquil stream. Pictures fall. Everyone, particularly the kids, is terrified.Desperate for help, Carolyn contacts the Warrens, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga). Ed is a demonologist - yes - and Lorraine is a clairvoyant. As soon as they step over the threshold of the Perron house, Lorraine sees a presence, and she and Ed, both veterans of investigating the paranormal, are soon faced with the most treacherous, beguiling case of their lives.The framework of the movie is that of a traditional haunted-house story, with the terror turned up past 11. That's because - no spoiler here - there are multiple spirits about, although they share a common ancestor, spiritually speaking. Roger and Carolyn are helpless, which we expect; Ed and Lorraine are as well, which we do not. Also, poor Lorraine has already suffered tremendous emotional trauma from previous investigations. Even if and when the investigators can determine the root of the Perrons' problem, they may not be sufficiently equipped to deal with them, even with their cameras, infrared devices, temperature sensors, and the help of assistant Drew and police officer Brad.This movie is terrifying. Director James Wan is an expert at manipulating light and sound to heighten our sense of dread and fear. When Carolyn descends into the cellar, we descend with her, our hearts palpitating like a lawnmower. Both Ed and Carolyn are inherently relatable, as are their five daughters. Who hasn't played a game like Hide and Clap? (It's sort of like Blind Man's Bluff or Marco Polo, on land.) This is definitely one of the scariest movies of the year, and thankfully it wasn't released in 3D. There are long tracking shots that will exhaust and exhilarate; off-camera noises sound closer and closer with each pressing, bottled-up moment. There is very little blood, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a harmless movie for kids, either. Whereas The Amityville Horror was almost cartoonish - bleeding walls? - The Conjuring relies most heavily on the human psyche for its fright attack. And it is very, very successful at scaring one almost breathless. There are a lot of things to love about this movie, from its creepy atmosphere juxtaposed with its all-American family to the evocative acting by all of the principals, particularly Farmiga and Taylor, for whom this is her best role to date. No character feels generic or ill-formed, and the intricate, tortuous plot is complex without being complicated. This is a movie to see.",9,0,2,21 July 2013
Prometheus," Prometheus is bound to please
","If someone had to make a quasi prequel to Alien, I'm glad it was Ridley Scott. This dark, energetic, and unnerving thriller takes us to the purported point of human creation. It's as epic as the hype made it out to be, backed by a fluid, mysterious mythology and a passing nod to not only Alien itself but also to 2001: A Space Odyssey.It's 2093, and man has discovered the same cave painting (predating known human existence) in remote locations across the globe. They take it as an invitation to visit other planets, although you or I may take it another way. They've pinned down where they think the creators of these drawings and have zoomed off on a long, long, cryogenically enhanced journey to meet their Makers.Like the Nostromo in Alien, the Prometheus is populated with an array of interesting characters. The scientific expedition is led by Drs. Shaw and Holloway (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) and includes engineers, biologists, and geologists. The captain of the ship is Janek, played by Idris Elba. The commander is Charlize Theron, and - as with most Alien movies - there's a nonhuman, David, played by Michael Fassbender.We join the crew as the ship arrives at its destination, an unnamed moon in a far-off solar system. This, they think, is where those long-ago visitors originated. They plan to, uh, talk to them. You know, sort of rap with them to find out why they abandoned them and so forth. Almost nothing goes right. The mission is funded by the Weyland Corporation (its long-dead owner gives the crew a message via hologram), but it's possible that its agenda and that of the scientists aren't a complete match. I guess it's safe to say that everyone finds more than they bargained for. Shaw and Holloway desperately want to be right - one for the sake of scientific bragging, the other because of more spiritual, internalized reasons. Personally, if I were in their shoes I'd be questioning why I was on the mission (even if I had discovered all the cave paintings) and if my benefactor had any ulterior motives. These are some trusting scientists, is what I'm getting at here.The movie is dark, which begs the question of why anyone in his or her right mind would pay money to see it in 3D. 3D absorbs light. If you have a dark scene shot in 3D, it will be even darker. And you're in a dark room. Poor foolishness. That's why I saw it in plain ol' 2D. The movie looked terrific, from the bulky, craggy surface of the moon to the tight-fitting chambers within it, mimicked to some degree by the interior of the ship itself. The best sci-fi includes answers that lead to more questions, and Prometheus is no exception. We know about as much as the scientists know and almost nothing of what Commander Vickers knows. The plot takes some twists that are both plausible and unexpected, and the action scenes are impeccable. Everything adds to the mythos of the Alien universe, but as soon as we learn something - something else doesn't quite add up. Not in the illogical sense but in the sense that there is so much more that our characters (and we) just don't yet know. And that's good storytelling. We identify with certain aspects of most of the characters, even the cyborg David, and that means we manipulate with and are manipulated by them in turn. It's a majestic movie, especially for one with so many scenes set in confined quarters. Technology, innovation, and creativity, with scarce use of CGI, are on display here. There may not be a scene that's quite the equal of the notorious chest-bursting scene from the original, but trust me when I note that there are plenty of close substitutes, including a couple of pulse-pounding death scenes. The acting is universally excellent. Theron has a tough role as the icy commander with a lot on her mind, but she pulls it off without seeming too detestable. Elba makes for a fine paradox, a laid-back daredevil. Rapace is a truly wonderful find as the gritty heroine. Guy Pearce shows up, although you won't recognize him. But they all take a back seat to Fassbender, who follows quite expertly in the shoes of Ian Holm; in fact, he surpasses Holm's fine earlier work. Fassbender's David is both intelligent and empathetic, even though he lacks feelings himself. He is at the center of all the subterfuge in this film, circles around circles of deceit.Prometheus is certainly one of the best in the Alien series, surpassed perhaps only by the second one (Aliens plural). It includes stunning visual effects, a taut, brainy storyline, humanized performances, and an eye-opening denouement.",9,5,16,16 June 2012
Despicable Me," Great voice showcase for Carell's comedic improv
","Despicable Me, from its initial previews, looked kind of, well, lame. Like it wasn't sure what it wanted to be. Was it about good versus evil? The little tots who wind up in almost every scene were barely seen in the initial trailers. So I had sort of dismissed the movie. But that was a wrong decision, as the movie has a lot of heart, terrific voice performances, and a simple, plausible plot that can please both youngsters and cranky old people. And the rest of you.Groo (Steve Carell) is the world's number-one supervillain. He lives in a lair that's beset on all sides by suburbia, and deep within that lair are house his thousands of minions, tiny little alien-looking creatures who serve to live and live to serve. (They sort of remind me of the alien toys from Toy Story.)Groo is a mastermind who has big, big plans – he wants to go to the moon, shrink it, bring it back to earth, and ransom it for untold riches. To do this, he needs a loan from an evil banker (Will Arnett), who won't even talk to him until Groo can produce the needed shrink ray. Meanwhile, Groo isn't the only evil bastard out there, as a new kid on the block named Vector (Jason Segal) is already outdoing him in sheer villainy, having swiped the Great Pyramid of Giza.Vector has the shrink ray, and Groo has a problem. He hits upon a most cynical solution – he'll use orphans! He adopts a trio of little girls (led by Miranda Cosgrove) who have been tasked with selling cookies door to door, and it turns out Vector's ordered a huge batch. Groo sees this as a way into Vector's own lair, thus allowing him to grab the gun and get the loan and shrink the moon and get all the riches in the world! But he doesn't quite count on the girls' charms. It's said that Groo's heart grew (ha, unintended pun) three sizes that day.Carell gives Groo a Slavic/Russian accent that's reminiscent of, among others, Bela Lugosi and Blofeld. The voice and the character are a perfect match, and Carell is terrific as he always seems to be in his voice work. Groo looks like The Penguin, come to think of it, adding another layer of villainy.Anyway, one thing that makes this work is that the shift from Groo as terrifying bad guy to cuddly father figure is slight, slow, and completely believable. Imagine if you hated kids, or at least had no real use for them. Then you do find a use and figure you can discard them later on, only you find it ain't that easy. Never is with kids, is it? The movie could have taken the easier way of having Groo recruit the kidlets to help him in his nefarious scenes, but instead they have him blindly pretend nothing is amiss, that the minions are his cousins, and so on. Subtlety is key.The animation is pretty good, about what you'd expect. It was probably a real hoot to see in 3D, but alas I saw it on my home screen, which is still in 2D and will remain so until the industry has its act together. But even in 2D, it's an exciting, entertaining movie, and it has some 3D-oriented surprises during the end credits.",7,0,1,16 April 2011
1408," Your spine will shatter with terror
","Prepare to be shocked! 1408, the story of a truly haunted hotel room, is electric and terrifying and not a little bit unsettling.John Cusack stars as Mike Enslin, a writer who specializes in debunking haunted-whatever myths. He's stayed in hotels and inns and B&Bs all across the country and has not, he says, ever seen evidence of paranormal behavior. Even so, he's managed to make a somewhat modest living writing about his experiences. He's a cynic, as most writers are, but Enslin is not only skeptical about things, he outright doesn't believe in anything, owing in no small part to an earlier tragedy in his life.And then one day he finds a postcard in his mail from the Dolphin Hotel in New York. There's but one sentence on the back: 'Don't go into Room 1408.' Enslin's research then shows that numerous people have died in that particular hotel room - people jumping to their deaths, people slashing their own throats, gouging their own eyes, and so on. Pretty creepy stuff. But since that's sort of par for the course in Enslin's line of work, he doesn't think much of it and manages to wrangle a reservation in the infamous room.The hotel's manager, Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) tries desperately to talk Enslin out of staying in the room overnight. No one lasts more than an hour, he warns. Olin points out that many people have died in 1408 of *natural* causes, too - bringing the death toll to 56. Olin even offers Enslin a rare bottle of booze and the chance to read up on the history of the room, anything to keep Enslin from actually going into the room. He fails.And who could blame Enslin for being a wee bit skeptical that 1408 is anything to be scared of? He's been in so many places just like the Dolphin, from seedy motels to high-rise palaces, and he's never seen anything all that terrifying, and certainly nothing that couldn't be explained away easily enough. And then he steps into 1408, and all hell breaks loose.It appears to be such an ordinary room, a fact that Enslin notes into his dictaphone. But then it gets hot, and the window slams shut on his fingers, and he hears a baby crying, and most importantly, the digital clock radio seems to be counting down from one hour - even after he forcibly yanks it from the wall outlet. Before you know it, ghosts from his own past are appearing in his room alongside the ghosts of those who'd died there themselves.The greatest part about all of this is that while Enslin's mind is being tortured, smacked around like a tetherball hooked to a pole of sanity, we're suffering right along with him. We jump when he jumps - and not before he jumps. He feel like screaming just as he does. We're right there with him through ever shiver, every shudder, every wide-eyed gulp of terror. Enslin isn't merely frazzled, he's undone. Even he can't explain the happenings inside 1408 as creaky floorboards or bad wiring. The horror in the room is personal, reducing even the cockiest skeptic into a pile of blubbering goo.Cusack, whom I think is one of the finest actors of his generation, is absolutely aces. His idiom is that he's an Everyman, not someone to whom superhuman powers have been conveyed. Throw another actor into the movie, and you'd expect him to grit his teeth and wipe out the unseen enemies with a blowtorch and some grenades, but not Cusack. Cusack's Enslin doesn't know how to deal with the psychological warfare, because neither would we.That ripping sound you just heard? It was your sanity departing right after Enslin's.***1/2",9,1,2,23 June 2007
The Woman in Black," Positive evocation of Dracula and other period Hammer films
","Creepy and off-putting, The Woman in Black really is a terrific thriller. It's intended to shock, and in many scenes it is successful. It's a moody, psychologically scarring throwback to the old Roger Corman movies based on Edgar Allan Poe stories, with an amazing adult performance by Daniel Radcliffe as a young lawyer out of his depth. Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), a down-on-his-luck attorney, is asked to travel to a remote village and find out if a recently deceased woman has left any heretofore unknown wills. It's Kipps' last shot at success, his employer sternly warns him. His journey to the village is eerily similar to that undertaken by Jonathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Something's not quite right with the town, which clearly doesn't want him around, something to do with children being murdered and people blaming a dead woman. You know how it is.Kipps' sleuthing leads to more and more questions. Who was the woman (ostensibly, his client), really? What relationship did she have with the town? And what of those treacherous marshes, and that long and winding road to the main house that is impassable when the tide is in? Why is it that every time Kipps turns around, a shadow darts away? Understanding that these are all staples of the great horror movies of yore doesn't mean that this film is stealing; it is merely authentically replicating the desolate atmosphere, in which a whisper can signal death.I entered the theater knowing very little of the movie's content. Was it to be a mystery, and we'd find out who the titular woman was at some point? It is, and we do, but that is only part of the puzzle. The best horror movies, in my opinion, are the ones that build just the right amount of suspense and then pull the rug out from under the viewer. A slow buildup must have a satisfying payoff. Showing the evil the lurks in every other scene dilutes the fright quotient. This movie doesn't do that. It pulls no punches to our psyche. It is so closely shot by Tim Maurice-Jones, who's best known for his work with Guy Ritchie. Maurice-Jones' style here is to capture almost every shot from Kipps' perspective, thus bringing the audience that much closer to the terror he's supposed to be feeling. Radcliffe, to his credit, never comes off as some innocent lad who's just starting out in the business, and although Kipps is perplexed - much like Edward Woodward's character in The Wicker Man - he is determined to see things through, even though he has strayed a bit from his original mission. Something is definitely wrong here, and it involves the children. Are they to blame for the nefarious goings-on? Are their parents? No one is saying anything. To make matters worse for Kipps, he has a young son of his own, whose mother died in childbirth and who is coming to visit Kipps in a few days. The grief felt by the parents of the fallen children only heightens Kipps' own fears. There are several moments that, on the Internet, would be called shock videos. Everything seems normal, and then BAM, something pops out of nowhere. In lesser movies, this might be seen as a crutch, a way to stun your senses to get a particular reaction, but here it all fits in, and it conveys mortal terror. The Woman in Black's identity is revealed very early in the film, so the mystery isn't who she is but why these events keep occurring. Is it all superstition, or is there something more to the spiritual aspect of the plot?The ending is tidy and satisfying, but it is by no means conventional or predictable. In fact, it opens up even more questions. But more importantly, director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman (based on a book by Susan Hill) do not take the easy way out. People do not necessarily live happily ever after. Story threads are not necessarily sewn up tight. It is a riveting film steeped in a macabre atmosphere teeming with the potential of death with every slow approach to a corner or a locked door.",8,91,142,12 February 2012
Shrek," Shrekervesence!
","In the old days of animated movies, you always had a syrupy-sweet movie in which the hero overcomes big odds to win the heart of the fair maiden or some such nonsense. Nowadays, however, kids aren't as gullible. So for the past few years, studios - including but not limited to Disney - have come out with some very cool movies that have appealed to both children and adults. Toy Story was a pioneer in this field, although it's not the only one. Follow the evolution to Antz and A Bug's Life, and finally you come to the present masterpiece, Shrek. Shrek is a giant green ogre (voiced marvelously by Mike Myers) who lives alone in a swamp. Every now and again the people from a nearby village try to oust him (shades of Frankenstein!), but he scares 'em away right proper. But unbeknownst to Shrek, the evil Lord Farquaad (don't read it too quickly in front of kids!) has banished all 'fairy tale creatures' from the forest and placed them on Shrek's swamp. Imagine his surprise! (The creatures include knock-offs of Pinocchio, the three pigs, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and so on.) And to add insult to his further injury, a charmed, talking donkey named Donkey (voiced by the inestimable Eddie Murphy) wants to be Shrek's pal. To get the creatures off his land, Shrek goes to the source of the trouble - Farquaad (John Lithgow). The evil one, after Shrek beats the beejezus out of all the lord's knights, tells Shrek he will get rid of the fairy tale creatures if the ogre will go on a quest for him. The quest, it turns out, consists of Shrek journeying to a far-off castle and rescuing a fair princess (Cameron Diaz). Oh yes, and slaying a dragon, too, to get to her. Does this sound like the typical kids' film so far? And of course, Donkey must tag along. One of the best trends in recent yeards regarding these animated movies is that when producers get celebrities to voice characters, they give the celebrities free reign to improvise a little. Murphy is hilarious, audacious, and absolutely riotous as Donkey. He easily steals every scene he's in, which is most of them. Murphy's as funny here as Robin Williams was in the original Aladdin, a wild, untamed bundle of energy and raucous humor. He drops a couple of mild double-entendres and the requisite flatulence jokes and a whole bunch of pop culture references. Lithgow is wonderfully sneering as the short-statured lord, both despotic and self-serving, but one of those Snidely Whiplash-type characters who always seem to be muttering under their breath, 'Curses! Foiled again!' Diaz has a lovely voice, tenuous when it should be, strong and mighty when it should be. But it's Myers as the humble and yet garrulous Shrek who's running things here. He's at times petulant, antisocial, and moody, but also courageous and very knightly indeed. There are some who have quibbled about Myers' using a Scottish accent for Shrek, but according to reports the actor (who's from Canada) was originally supposed to do a Canadian accent. Personally, I think the Scottish one's a lot better. This is great whiz-bang fun, and the in-jokes never let up. Watch it all the way through!",9,0,0,22 May 2001
Vanilla Sky," Never bland, but never terribly interesting (or comprehensible)
","In an era of big-budget, super-duper special effects movies, a lot of people pine for the old days when plot meant something and characterization was key. Well, look what we get. A convoluted, disinterested absurd piece of pablum that's not worth the celluloid on which it was filmed.Vanilla Sky is about a dashing young publisher named David Aames (Tom Cruise) who has two women in his life - his 'buddy' Julie (Cameron Diaz) and mysterious new woman Sofia (Penelope Cruz), who just happens to be his best friend's girlfriend. David feels he's being stalked by Julie, who wants more than sex, but he can't keep his eyes and hands off Sofia. You can see this is just heading for trouble.Much of the plot centers around a violent car crash in which David emerges with a disfigured face. What happens after that is quite surreal - kind of like floating in a dream in which at once everything and nothing seems to have meaning. Under such circumstances, one can twist logic and reality into whatever one desires (in this case, 'one' would be the screenwriter). Anything can happen and be justified. That's great, but it doesn't always make for a good movie, just as free association doesn't make for a good novel.To begin with, Cruise himself seems miscast, although ironically so. He's the kind of movie actor who much of the world sees as the cocky, arrogant, preening archetype of male stars, always worried about how they look. And yet here he is with a horribly ugly face - is he trying to tell the world, 'Look, I can play creepy-looking, too!' No, Tom, you can't.And for at least the third movie, I hear Cruise utter these words, or a variation: 'I've been set up!' He sure gets set up a lot - see The Firm, this one, and the upcoming Minority Report, to name three. What it all goes back to is his characters' inability to believe they themselves have done anything wrong, ever.Secondly, there's a huge lack of chemistry between any of the three leads, especially between Cruise and Cruz. I'm sure there are legions of people who believe Penelope Cruz is the cat's pajamas, but don't count me among them. I didn't find her particularly attractive or alluring in the movie. I won't waste space picking apart her obvious physical issues, but please - let's not place her on some goddess pedestal. But for a couple that apparently fell for each other off the set, Cruise and Cruz don't seem particularly enamored of each other on it. Yes, they make goo-goo eyes to each other. Snoresville.And that plot! It's one thing to have twists and turns, each leading to more questions and mysteries, and it's quite another to have each twist cancel out the last twist. The movie kept negating itself. I know it was trying to show that the line between dreams and reality can be seriously blurred, but you can't have each scene render the last one irrelevant. Instead of being clever, all this does is confuse and frustrate the viewer.About the only real spark of life comes from David's best friend Brian, played by Jason Lee. And you know, when Jason Lee's the only one making things happen, you know you got yourself a crappy movie. There are supposed heavyweights in this movie - Cruise, Diaz - and your best performance is by Jason Lee of Mallrats and Almost Famous (another Cameron Crowe movie, like this flop)? Geez!I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater, although I might not have been so critical if I had (you know, it's the classic 'I spent $8 on this, so I'm gonna like it!' rhetoric). I don't think Cruise's career is in any kind of jeopardy, as evidenced by his usual $20 million paycheck. He might want to develop an additional facial expression or two, however.This is a bizarre, pointless movie that seems to take delight in its tortured script, wallowing in its own nonsense.",3,6,12,3 June 2002
X-Men: First Class," A surprisingly good prequel that does what it sets out to do
","This prequel to the popular series is better than I expected, especially considering class is never officially in session during the movie. It's another origin film designed to show us how the original X-Men came to be and how their founder, Charles Xavier, teamed up with Erik Lehnsherr to thwart a thermonuclear war in 1962. Along the way, we learn about the Erik's inner demons and thirst for revenge and Charles' implacable sensibility. I was interested in seeing this movie not just because I wanted to know how it all began but because I was already emotionally invested in the series, having seen four X-Men movies just in the past decade or so. That's how Hollywood is getting you nowadays, you know. Make a big movie, then make a sequel, then a prequel, then a spin-off, all designed to keep you coming back, because you know each character and recognize a bit of yourself in them as well. Here, you have the dark side (Magneto) and the light side (Professor X) - much like Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films, right? A classic setup.We learn that Erik, later to become Magneto, is a concentration-camp survivor who saw his mother shot to death when he could not perform his extrasensory powers to the camp commandant under duress. Now he is out to find that commander, some twenty years later. Alternatively, Charles is a ladies' man who's also exceedingly bright, working on a theses about genetics. He's a telepath and wishes to learn more about genetic mutations. His childhood friend Raven has her own mysterious powers - in her true form she is entirely blue with red hair, a striking if possibly unwelcoming figure. The unifying agent that brings Erik (Michael Fassnbender) and Charles (James McAvoy) together is one Sebastian Shaw, played by an oily Kevin Bacon. Shaw's plan is to get the US and the USSR to declare war on one another, thus wiping each other out, thus (apparently) leaving only mutants, who shall inherit the Earth. Erik wants to kill Shaw; Charles simply wants to stop him. They're consistently at odds with each other as they recruit other mutants to their cause in 1962, even as Charles helps Erik break down his own barriers to harness his powers.This gets the CIA involved (Rose Byrne), and then there's a well-done standoff at the US-USSR blockade showdown (you know, the Bay of Pigs) that tests the wills of everyone involved. I liked that; good action.A recurring theme in the X-Men movies is the battle between being who you are (i.e., a mutant) and being accepted by society (i.e., a mutant who looks like everyone else). It's not hard to draw a comparison between being a mutant and being 'different.' Do you want to just fit in, or do you want to be your own person? Raven, aka Mystique (played to perfection by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't sure, either. Neither are some of the other mutants, leading to a schism that would later show up in each of the other films.First Class isn't really anything special, but it's pleasing to the eye (both in effects and in cast choice) and keeps true to its familiar characters. It fits in fairly seamlessly with the other films. It's easy to follow, of course, and the cast does a very fine job. McAvoy seems to be getting better with each role (good thing, because he was one terrible actor when he started); Fassbender, Lawrence, even January Jones (as Emma Frost) are fine as well.",7,1,2,26 March 2012
Win Win," Terrific sleeper
","Win Win is a terrific multigenre sleeper. It's funny, even hilarious; it has mystery and action; and it features brilliant performances by the always-reliable Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan. It's also not a movie that wallows in treacly messages, and it's not a movie that uses sports as a crutch for 'finding one's inner strength.' In short, it's a wonderful, top-notch movie.Giamatti plays Mike Flaherty, a small-time lawyer who's running low on cash. He moonlights as coach of the local high-school team, which is, to put it bluntly, terrible. In a burst of fiscal sanity, Mike offers to become legal guardian for Leo, one of his clients (played by the crusty Burt Young), who's just been declared legally incapacitated. Why? Because as his guardian, Mike gets $1500 a month. But since he wants to avoid the extra hassle of actually taking care of Leo, he puts him in a nice home. Seriously, it's a nice home, with nice people and a big flat-screen TV.At this point, the movie wants us on Mike's side – sort of. He needs the cash, and he doesn't really want to tell his wife Jackie (Ryan) that they're running low, not with two young daughters to care for as well. Plus he's coach of a terrible team and is just swimming in stress. Swimming in it. So much so that while jogging to work off the stress, he suffers a panic attack.Just when Mike thinks some of his problems have been solved, teenage Kyle (Alex Shaffer) walks into his life. Kyle, it turns out, his Leo's grandson, and they've never met. Kyle's been sent by his mom to visit Leo. At first, this complicates things – especially when Kyle seems awfully reluctant to go back home to Ohio – but then Mike's remaining big problem is solved. It turns out the kid is a gifted wrestler. Who'd have thought that? He looks scrawny, but in practices Kyle shows he has the mettle. And thus things are riding well for Mike.But this would be a truly dull (if inspirational) movie if things continued to ride well. One thing we learn early on is that Mike intentionally misled the judge in Leo's case, giving the impression that he would be actively taking care of Leo. But things really get going when Kyle's druggie mom (Melanie Lynskey) shows up to bring her boy back – and to take over as Leo's guardian.Too often, Giamatti has played real sad-sack characters, guys who just can't seem to catch a break, guys who suffer at the hands of fickle fate. Not so here. Mike isn't exactly a conniving mastermind, but he's not an idiot, either, and he deals with each situation with logic and reason, even as they spiral further out of his control. It's a typically masterful Giamatti performance, and for once he's not a total loser who's in over his head. He's even a half-decent coach who simply has a lackluster team to work with.Giamatti's not alone, though. I really got a kick out of Amy Ryan's performance as his somewhat-exasperated spouse Jackie, who's not terribly fond of suddenly having a teenage boy around at first. A few years back, Ryan turned in an Oscar-nominated performance as a native Bostonian in Gone Baby Gone. Ryan had a thick, believable Boston accent then. Here, she's playing a New Jersey native, but at no point does she go overboard with the Jersey Shore dialect. That's what good actresses can do – they can dial it back when they have to and show a little nuance.Win Win is not a stand-up-and-cheer movie, although the audience at the screening I attended applauded when it was over. It's not a crime drama, and it doesn't really have a lot of twists to its plot. What makes it work are all of the truly sincere, dead-on performances: by Giamatti, Ryan, Shaffer, Lynskey, Bobby Cannavale, and even Jeffrey Tambor as one of Mike's wrestling assistant coaches. Not a sour note in the bunch, everyone at the top of his or her game.This might have fared well, critically, if it were released during awards season. It sort of reminded me of last year's Greenburg, starring Ben Stiller, only funnier and sweeter. Win Win is a charming, quiet movie that reminds us that, as the Grateful Dead once told us, once in a while you can get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right.",8,77,98,4 March 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Dazzling as expected, The Dark Knight Rises again
","The third (and final from Christopher Nolan) Batman movie might be the best yet. It's mysterious, exciting fun. I can't put it more elegantly. There's mountains of tension, ulterior motives galore, and once again some of the finest supporting acting in the business.Some time has passed since the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) spends his days brooding as only Batman can. He's taken the fall for the misdeeds of Harvey Dent and has therefore stayed out of the spotlight. But when a new supervillain takes Gotham by terroristic storm, the Bat must come out of his, er, cave and right some wrongs - some much more psychological than others.Bane (Tom Hardy) is a giant of a man who wears what looks like a cross between Darth Vader's helmet and a WW II gas mask. Apparently he needs it to breathe. What's more important is that he's out to destroy Gotham. Why? Well, it's just one of the tidbits you discover during the film that fit into the larger puzzle. Bane has a destiny to fulfill, as does Batman.On a lower level, the new DA Foley (striving for commissioner) is knocking heads with the perpetually in-danger Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) while being upstaged by the tyro cop Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Plus there's a cat burglar (meow) named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), who makes Michelle Pfeiffer's version seem like Little Lulu from the comics (ask your grandparents).Wayne Enterprises isn't doing so well, either, not with its wonderboy in seclusion. It does, however, have a huge energy-saving device, destined to change the world. The device, designed by one Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), is shut down by Bruce, once he learns that it could be weaponized. That would be bad, as it has a nuclear core.The plot is full of twists, the good kind. I don't like it much when something unexpected happens that simply doesn't make a lot of sense or is obviously shoehorned into the plot for no good reason. Surprises are great, as long as they're plausible, and this one has then by the bat-load. Well, a lot of bat-loads.Of course, there's plenty of action, and any time there's a woman in a tight catsuit riding a motorcycle, I think you have a winner. Helps when that woman is Anne Hathaway. Anyway, some great set pieces, particularly one on a football field that's already been seen by everyone who watched the trailer, but it still rocks.Standouts abound among the cast: Hathaway is cunning and sexy; Cotillard is elusive, handy, compassionate. Hardy is as his name indicates; he's a monster of a man with more than a touch of intellect and cleverness. He looks like a circus strongman but with the showmanship of a magician and the sense of forensic psychologist. Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and especially Michael Caine turn in some of the very best work.Christian Bale is Christian Bale. Never liked him much in the first two in this Bat-series, but he is improved this time around. Good thing, because there's more to Batman than simply punching people in the eye. He's supposed to be the crafty type. He should be a good actor, what with being Bruce Wayne as well. Bale, who really is a terrific actor anyway, raises his Batman level a couple of notches and should be lauded.I mentioned there were twists. I won't explain them here, but I did love how those twists dovetailed logically with events from the previous two films. That's good writing. Sometimes a twist is thrown in just to mess with the audience. Here the twists confirm foreshadowing or even introduce exposition where it's sorely needed.The ending is a nice touch. It's bittersweet, playing the audience for keeps, and it works splendidly. The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant coda to a troika of uneven films. It is perhaps the most humanistic of the three. Batman is, more than ever, a human with some special abilities, but even he cannot survive happily without the family and friends he's made along the way. Nolan (and his brother Jonathan) have done a typically fantastic job.",9,3,8,23 July 2012
Creed II," Even Nu Drago is the same as Classic Drago
","Creed II's predecessor was very well done, a strong vehicle for Michael B. Jordan to showcase his talents and a movie that was able to differentiate itself from all the other Rocky movies. Creed II, though, hearkens directly back to Rocky IV, in which Rock fights Ivan Drago, the man who killed Apollo Creed in the ring. This time, it's Apollo's son Adonis (Jordan) taking on, you guessed it, Ivan's son. After losing to Balboa, Ivan Drago returned to Russia in disgrace, and now he wants his son to exact revenge on his behalf. No clue why Ivan couldn't have done so himself 20 years ago. The story arc is also fairly routine for the series, with Creed (now champ) fighting and losing and fighting and winning and usually winding up a bloody mess at the end, no matter the outcome. Sylvester Stallone is still excellent as Rocky, and Tessa Thompson, although no longer a revelation (thanks to her work in Creed and the Marvel movies), is still quite terrific. The ring scenes are very well shot and will make your heart pound. A fitting coda to the series, if indeed that's the plan.",7,0,1,10 July 2019
Casino Royale," Better than both Daltons and most of the Brosnans, anyway
","The first thing to consider about this twenty-first Bond screen foray is that it's not a continuation of the first twenty. In fact, it doesn't even take place in the same virtual universe - it's as if those other twenty Bonds never existed. The film takes place in the present day, but it's about Bond's beginnings as a 00. So scratch the 1962-2002 Bond adventures, obliterate them from your memory banks, because they just plain never happened.The film begins with a black and white scene that shows the two kills Bond (Daniel Craig) must make in order to attain 00 status. The two deaths starkly illustrate the types of killing Bond will need to do: One is a brutal drowning in a men's room, and the other is a subtle shooting.Then the real action kicks in, as Bond, in deepest, darkest Uganda, is tipped off about a rogue bomb dealer and winds up blowing up part of an embassy. Oops. He's exiled by an unforgiving M (Judi Dench, reprising the role she's had for five films, now), told to take some time off. Because, you see, he's a loose cannon, a ticking time bomb, an egotist who just can't separate emotion from his work. At any rate, we know that this setback won't last long, and sure enough Bond's traced his bomb dealer to a Greek magnate who looks like Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat, and from there he's led to Miami and a thrilling scene at the airport involving a fuel truck and (of course) the world's newest, largest airplane in, like, forever.All of this leads up to the casino of the title, as Bond must play Texas Hold 'Em (replacing baccarat from the 1967 version of Casino Royale) against high rollers, including the Bond Bad Guy, Le Chiffre, an odd-looking Eurocreep who weeps tears of blood. Other than the blood thing, he's kind of bland, but his icy disregard of, well, everything lends a distinct air of haughtiness against which Bond can play. Accompanying Bond is Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), the typical smart/pretty Bond Girl we've seen in the last several films in the series. She's supposed to watch over Bond and all the money he's been staked in the game, but naturally she must keep emotional distance from the Lothario. Can she do that? My gosh, I do wonder.Missing from Casino Royale are gadgetry (including Q) and bon mots typical of action heroes. Well, wait, the former's not completely; we do see a nifty tracking device implanted in Bond's arm, but that's not as exciting as, perhaps, the invisible car in Die Another Day, or killer shoes, or something. Also gone, sort of, is Bond's womanizing attitude. Well, it's toned down, anyway; at one point, Bond tells Vesper that she's not his type. What type? she wonders. 'Single,' says the spy. Ah, so that's how it's gonna be.Craig was pretty good, actually. It's got to be monumentally tough for an actor to play James Bond nowadays; with each film, there's more for the next guy to live up to. Roger Moore's first entry was pretty darn good (Live and Let Die), but it still took him a little while to fully grow into the role. Timothy Dalton never did. Pierce Brosnan's work improved as the quality of the movies themselves declined. Craig's ice-blue eyes - those have to be contacts! - say a lot, from a character that plays his cards very, very close to his chest. I think the best thing to be said about Craig's work here is that he acquitted himself rather nicely, and that if he does indeed continue with the role, he'll get even better as he reaches his comfort zone.And, for the first time in recent memory, the plot's not too convoluted. Several of the Brosnan Bond movies were overplotted to the point of hilarity; there were so many exotic locations and minor characters that it was easier to sit back and wait for people to get killed so you could sort out who was, indeed, good. It's a little easier this time around, although there are a couple of good twists in the final reel of the film.As new Bond Girl Vesper Lynd, Green is appropriately alluring and clever, innocent but corruptible. Will she fall for Bond? Yes, probably. Will he fall for her, though? Ah, that's a much tougher question. Regardless of how it turns out, though, you get a sense that Green is a good match for Craig; she's not taller than him, at least, and they just plain look good together. They do seem to have a palpable chemistry on screen, which is more than one could say for, say, Brosnan and Denise Richards in The World Is Not Enough. At least the makers of this one had the smarts to cast someone who could act against someone who could act.There are two ways to judge a James Bond movie: against other Bond films, and against other action films; after all, Dr. No practically reinvented the action movie, and the subsequent Connery Bonds transcended run-of-the-mill action movies. Casino Royale is an excellent action movie, and it's a highly entertaining Bond film in its own right; a fine first effort by Craig and better than several of those that came before it.",8,1,4,18 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Brilliant
","Good news: the new Toy Story movie is a sweet, charming coda to a endlessly endearing series. The dialog still crackles, the animation still sparkles, and the voice work still resonates. Well done all around.It's been 15 years since the original feature, and in movie time that means that little Andy is about all grown up. Well, headed off to college, anyway. As the movie begins, he'll be leaving for higher education in a few days and needs to figure out what to do with his Woody and Buzz and Jessie and Hamm toys, and others - does he donate them to the local daycare center, or does he put them up in the attic for safekeeping? That's really the question at the heart of the movie. Are the toys better off with Andy, in college - or somewhere else? They realize he's growing up, but surely he hasn't forgotten them entirely. And sure enough, we come to learn just how much these toys mean to Andy. It's a coming-of-age movie disguised as a Playskool parable.The gang's adventures lead them to the daycare center, where they meet up with a vast array of other toys, such as a Care Bear clone voiced by Ned Beatty, a Ken doll, and a Fisher-Price talking phone. One of the many hallmarks of this trilogy has been how well represented toys have been; obviously, Pixar (and Disney) spared no expense in getting the rights to some of these toys, which you have to admit is much better than the alternative: made-up toys no one cares about. That's a big reason the Toy Story movies work, of course, because they resonate with everyone. Each of us can see a piece of our childhood in the movie. That's why it bugs us when the evil neighbor kid or the evil toy collector do things to the toys, because they're not just toys to us - they're our toys, our lives, ourselves. To lay it on thickly.Anyway, what this one's all about is togetherness. Should Woody go with Andy to college while the others go to the attic, or wherever? Or should they stick together? The humor from the first two movies doesn't slow a bit, with wickedly whip-fast banter from Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm slicing the air with their barbs and trivia. There's even some mild character development - is that love I see between Buzz and Jessie? Another recurring theme in the series is that of abandonment. In TS2, Andy mistakenly put Woody in the family yard sale; here, the toys feel like they're similarly being put aside 'for later,' knowing that there won't be a later with Andy all but grown up. There are also repeated friends-abandoning-friends scenes as well. And, it seems, each toy in these movies - well, the lead toys - has some kind of story about how their old owner loved them to pieces and then one day just abandoned them. That feeling of abandonment plays a huge part in this movie.There's just so much to like about this. It's simply great to hear Tom Hanks and Tim Allen playing their famous characters again. In fact, there really are no slackers in the entire bunch of voice actors, especially Joan Cusack as Jessie. (And, thank goodness, we get only a couple of snippets of Randy Newman's 'You Got a Friend in Me.') There are some sad scenes, but for the most part they're obscured by some really fantastic 3D action scenes (see Woody escape daycare! See the rest of the gang elude the trash truck! Thrill to everyone avoiding the incinerator!). In fact, the only really sad scene, the one that'll be sure to yank the heart out of all adults and no kids, is the one in which Andy's mom sees her son off to college. She cries, and so will you. It's not only the end of Andy's childhood, it's the end to all our Toy Story laughs.The third Toy Story movie is warm hearted and elegant, a end to the trilogy that will really make your heart soar. It's a beautiful, hilarious movie that should be required viewing for kids of all ages.",9,2,3,20 June 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Maintains standard of previous two
","I have to say, straight out, that I enjoyed the third installment in this prehistoric animated series. I can’t get enough of the adventures of Manny and Sid and Diego, even as their “herd” continues to grow. Each of the movies is a lot of fun to watch, with just enough sweet scenes to balance things out.This time around, Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) are expecting, and of course Manny’s a nervous father to be. But that’s not all – the group dynamic is starting to shift in other ways as well. First, Diego (Denis Leary) is starting to feel old and in the way; second, Sid (John Leguizamo) is actually getting in the way of Manny’s well-laid plans. But like with the first couple of movies, what brings everyone together is a journey. This time around, Sid is accidentally snatched by a giant T-rex, whose eggs he had been, er, watching. And the race is on to find and rescue Sid in what’s apparently a dinocentric world right under our friends’ icy land.The visuals are stunning. Sweeping vistas of whites and blues when the gang is at home, and vibrant hues of browns, greens, and darker blues in the land of the dinosaurs. Computer animation has gotten to the point where the movies have the same level of quality as the early Disney cel animation films. The Ice Age films are wonderfully rendered, from those stunning backgrounds to the detailed expressions of the characters.I do hope, though, that the Ice Age films (if more are made) don’t fall into the same rut that befell the Land before Time series. There have now been thirteen LBT movies! Of course, only the first one was in theaters, but you get my drift. Let’s not see Ice Age XX: The Search for the Great Wisdom Tree or some such fluff. Now, each of the Ice Age films has been in theaters, and although none of them has been an instant classic, each has been charming fun, and the quality has not deteriorated over the films.So in essence, the latest Ice Age film maintains the high fun quotient of its predecessors without lapsing into schmaltz or too-broad physical humor. I mean, it IS a kids’ film, after all, so there’s plenty of physical humor to be found, but the comedy isn’t based solely on pain and suffering.",7,0,1,6 December 2009
Signs," Stop! Turn around! No entry!
","On one level, Signs is about those weird crop circles that appeared in various places in the 1970s. On another level, it's about faith and how people can find their own faith severely tested.But first, the crop circles. Who made them? Aliens, or humans playing a prank? In the present, the same mysterious circles are appearing throughout the world, including on a farm outside Philadelphia. The owner of this farm is Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest who renounced his faith when his wife was struck and killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel. Graham lives on his farm with his two kids Morgan (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and they all get along right fine until one weird morning when the kids discover that part of their corn crop has been flattened  - in a perfect circle.What could this mean? Well, it's not giving anything away to explain that the film goes the aliens-are-communicating-with-us route; but as the second layer of the film might indicate, this isn't just about humans versus aliens, it's about having faith that one can weather a storm.Older son Morgan immediately jumps on the it-must-be-aliens bandwagon, and he obtains a book on UFOs at a local bookstore. Soon, wouldn't you know it, he's got his sister and his uncle believing aliens are here, and they're up to no good. Morgan explains that the circles are the aliens' way of making a map, and in due time he and his family are wearing those dopey tin-foil hats that crazy people put on to keep aliens from reading their minds.Now, I want you to stop and reread that last part: They put on tin-foil hats so the aliens can't read their minds. Sure, I know what you're probably thinking - this movie's done in a campy, 50's sci-fi kind of way, where nothing seems terribly real, but it's still entertaining. That would have been fine, but that's not how this movie was presented. Every nuance, every step, everything in the movie is presented as deadly serious - even the stupid tin-foil-hat thing. People in the theater laughed when things seemed amusing, but the laughter was misplaced; there wasn't anything terribly humorous in the entire movie.First, let's look at the characters. Graham is a strong, stoic type, but he dearly misses his wife (her death is needlessly recreated - sure, it had a lot to do with the issue of Graham's faith, but it was still pointless) and probably isn't as good of a parent as he'd like to be. His brother Merrill is a former minor-league baseball player who's a few sandwiches short of a picnic lunch.  Much is made out of Merrill's dopiness (including a scene in which it's revealed why Merrill is not playing major league baseball), but I'm not sure why.Morgan and Bo are relatively interchangeable with other child characters. Morgan's a know-it-all, pushy and obnoxious. Oh, but we're supposed to think that has to do with his dad's lack of faith. Or am I looking too much into it? And Bo is just the sort of cutie-pie you'd expect, complete with those gosh-aren't-I-adorable facial and verbal expressions (you've no doubt seen the promos for the movie: 'There's a monster outside my bed, can I have a glass of water?).The characters are poorly developed, and they're not played very appealingly. Yes, I realize Graham is supposed to be a sort of hero with some notable flaws, and these flaws will be exploited at some point during the movie. And perhaps this is a movie about redemption, sure. But was it necessarily good writing to have Graham do bold, heroic things in one moment, and then be utterly clueless and indecisive in the next? And if so much was made of Merrill's slow-wittedness, why wasn't it capitalized on? How come he didn't figure into the overall theme of faith more than he did?And the kids! In one scene, they're scared; in another, they're almost authoritative. Both characters have less depth than an Etch-a-Sketch doodle. I kept expecting Graham to yell at them - just once - or discipline them in some way, at some point. Nope, never happened. Both actors playing the kids were a bit wooden, too - they couldn't decide whether to deliver their lines in a flat robotic monotone or to overemphasize every other syllable.The pacing was pretty inconsistent, too. There were scenes in the cornfield that were excellently done, typical of an M. Night Shymalan movie (he did The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, too); these scenes evoked real terror and suspense. But there were many scenes that just plain didn't make a whole lot of sense, at least in terms of the rest of the movie. At one point, the family goes into town; almost nothing that happens there is terribly important, and what is important should have taken just a few minutes. Not so. Those scenes dragged on and on and on.I haven't even touched on the whole aliens aspect of the plot. Yes, there are aliens, and yes you do see them. Let me introduce Mr. Shymalan to a new concept called special effects. Since you undoubtedly had a budget, perhaps you could have given us more than some dude in a wetsuit. I realize that the alien appearance was secondary to the real theme of the movie, but please - none of that aspect was even remotely believable.As in the worst movies, this film had a high quotient of 'Oh, come on!' moments. You know, when you're watching a scene and can't help but think, 'Oh, come on!' These are scenes that test one's credibility, much as Graham's faith was tested. There were contrivances, there were red herrings, and there were serious screenwriting missteps. I lost count at how many times I said, 'Oh, come on!' during the movie.This must go down as the worst M. Night Shymalan movie, and it also has to be one of the worst that Gibson's done in a long time. He wasn't right for the role, and even he couldn't make much sense of an implausible plot surrounded by nonsequiturs and terrible pacing.",1,4,6,6 August 2002
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," The old Woody would have never made this pap
","When will Woody Allen get over his ridiculous obsession with the pretentious rich? It used to be that he wrote for the masses, albeit the educated, urbane masses. So maybe he just needs to get back to his New York roots (again), but for the love of Gene Shalit, could he please stop turning in such bland crap? Does anyone else remember when Allen had a real knack for snappy dialog? For characters who seemed as real as the veins on your hand? When his movies were clever, not predictable? When each movie contained a rich, vibrant atmosphere that drew from both negative and positive aspects of The Big Apple? Or did I dream about all of those movies? Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a big dud. It's about a love/lust pentagon that involves titular friends (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannson), on vacation in the titular town, who encounter Bohemian painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). But Vicky's engaged to a sanctimonious tool (Chris Messina), and then Juan Antonio's unstable ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) shows up as well. And it being Spain, everyone's got lust on the brain, and there's plenty of partner swapping.To begin with, the movie's far too talky. True, many of Allen's early movies were just as reliant on dialog, but in those cases - I'm looking your way, Annie Hall and Manhattan - the dialog was florid and witty. Here it's dull and placid. So you get these long stretches where two of the characters, whomever they are, will talk, and talk, and talk endlessly about whatever their current situation is, without doing much about it. These people are the poster children for passive-aggressive behavior; even when they do act on something, it's devoid of passion and meaning.Except, of course, when Cruz shows up. Before we even meet her, Maria Elena is shown to be idolized by Juan Antonio, even after she stabbed him with a knife. She's shown as this fiery charmer with whom the charming Juan Antonio had a love-hate relationship, and when Cruz finally does appear on screen, you can see the attraction and tension between them. This is partially because of how well Bardem and Cruz work together here but also because the other actors have virtually no charisma, not even the free-wheeling, carefree, doesn't-know-what-she-wants Cristina (Johannson).But it's not just the talkiness and the lack of passion, it's the fact that this is a Woody Allen movie that behaves more like a John Badham movie, a movie that is virtually indistinguishable from other movies in the genre 0 in this case, romantic melodrama, I assume. On the plus side, it's not as horrendous as Allen's Match Point, which started out as a romantic melodrama and then inexplicably transformed into a deranged-stalker/murderer movie, but that doesn't make this a good movie by any stretch.Perhaps it's a bit unfair to compare this to Allen's old movies, since everyone evolves, but I do wish he'd come back to writing about middle-class characters instead of these well-to-do, conceited knuckleheads. Watching his upper-class fables reminds me more of Merchant-Ivory dramas than anything else, and perhaps we should leave those movies to the likes of Merchant and Ivory, or Whit Stillman. This is a costume-drama period piece sans costumes or, uh, a period. It's wildly predictable - you can guess the sexual permutations about 20 minutes early - and a boring footnote to the master's long career.",4,31,50,24 August 2008
Identity," Killin' em wetly - but great ending!
","On the surface, Identity seems like a cheap knockoff of an Agatha Christie paperback. You know the type. Several disparate types are stranded on an island or in an old mansion or a broken-down hotel, and it's raining cats and dogs outside, and wouldn't you know it, but they're being picked off, one by one. But beyond the obvious setup, this isn't anything like And Then There Were Young or its myriad imitations. This has a few twists, including an outstanding one right near the end. Several people wind up at a ramshackle motel in the middle of nowhere. It's pouring rain. The road's been flooded both ways, so no one can get out. Among the stranded are a limo driver (John Cusack) and his employer-actress (Rebecca DeMornay), an irascible cop (Ray Liotta) and the convict he's chaperoning (Jake Busey), a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a newlywed couple, and a man (John C. McGinley) and his family, complete with a mute son.Pretty disparate, all right. But trouble's afoot from the get-go, as Cusack, blinded by the torrential rain, runs over McGinley's wife, causing severe injuries. As the woman slips in and out of consciousness, Cusack must rush to the hospital to get an ambulance (phone's out, of course, and she can't be moved). But then it's flooded, see, and... well, everyone winds up back at the motel. Sometimes thrillers explain themselves a bit too well - and too often - and the viewer has too much of an idea what's coming. Telegraphing what's to happen to a character is one of the biggest flaws of most thrillers, and if the viewer stops and thinks about the movie, the movie's sunk. Once thought enters the viewers mind, the holes in the plot are as familiar as Swiss cheese.But the plot in Identity holds up very well, thanks in no small part to a great cast. Normally, in ensemble pieces like this the cast is comprised of once-great or once-pretty-good actors, people you've heard of but not lately. But Identity's cast is peppered with names familiar for their recent talents, and not their tabloid prowess. For instance, what's Cusack doing here? Isn't he slumming? Yes..... and no. It's a murder thriller, but he elevates the movie far beyond its rudimentary whodunit origins.Cusack's great - I've yet to see him be awful - but he's not the only one with a bravura performance. Liotta's turn as the cop is gritty (he's no stranger to the role, playing a similar one in Unlawful Entry) and ultimately believable, and McGinley's a lot better than the underwritten role he was handed. Also shining is Peet as the hooker - I've never really liked her, but she did a good job with a good role.And the atmosphere is wonderful! It felt like it was raining in my apartment. I jumped when they jumped, and I cringed when they cringed. That's good camerawork.The good aspects are the ending, the ending, the acting, the ending, and the atmosphere; the bad aspect is the middle stuff, as a lot of the movie is slasherific. But the ending is excellent, in case I forgot to mention it. The only thing I will tell you is that the standard 'everyone dies' mantra begun by some guy named Shakespeare or something doesn't hold true here.

Beowulf," Failed epic falls short of 300 standard
","Beowulf wants badly to be an epic movie, with its heroes and kings, its wondrous vistas, its dragons, and its evil demons, and it certainly is a pretty fair film. It's sort of a combination of 300 and The Polar Express and leans heavily on CGI effects to sell itself. This usually works, but as with Polar Express the facial expressions of the humans look more like a snazzy video game than anything approaching realistic.Most Americans learned about the tale of Beowulf in high school, about how the young hero slayed the creature Grendel and became a legend. Here, Beowulf's tale is expanded and clarified; what really happened when he strode into that cave to take on the murderous demon? Turns out that Grendel's got a mom, and she's not the forgive-and-forget kind, and before you know it, Beowulf's sliding down a slippery slope of his own device.Voiced by Ray Winstone, the youthful Beowulf and his band of warriors arrive in Denmark to slay the beast that's been terrorizing the towns. King Hrothgar (Anthony Perkins) has offered half the riches of his kingdom to whomever can lift their curse. Grendel does come, and after slaying some of Beowulf's men (including biting off a head and chewing it), he's finally taken down by Beowulf himself with his bare arms - but that's just the beginning of Beowulf's troubles, as Grendel's mom is a bit unhappy.The voice characterizations are top notch. It's good to see the gifted Winstone get some work as the hero, because he doesn't really fit the mold of matinÃ©e idol; he's more of a craggy, rough-looking character. But here, he's as smooth as Russell Crowe, thanks to the wonders of CGI. Hopkins is his usual Anthony Hopkins self (sorry, I mean Sir Anthony), lending gravitas that a king should have. Jolie, it should be noted, was a bit unhappy with the resulting CGI for her role, which showed perhaps a bit more skin than the actress had intended to have shown. (Sure, it's not actually her body, but it looks like her, so...) But she's silkily cruel as the water demon out to avenge her son. Offering stout support as always are Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich, as Beowulf's right-hand man and the king's top commander, respectively. Robin Wright Penn is merely okay in a rather important role as the queen; amazingly, she doesn't look nearly as gorgeous as the real-life Wright Penn does.But it's the CGI of the humans that I found a little off putting. Rather than looking seamless in a pseudo-comic-book style, as in 300, the people here look a bit creepy, as if they were originally created to appear in some cheesy 3-D porn. I mean some cheesy Flash animation. As with the earliest Pixar films, the animation of humans just doesn't look right; with The Polar Express (directed by Robert Zemeckis, as was Beowulf), the people looked almost creepy and lacked a large range of expressions.Beowulf is an exciting action movie and contains plenty of intense, well-animated combat scenes, but it falls a little short of being the technical marvel or full-bore sweeping epic that it wants to be.",6,0,1,8 March 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Utterly charming and entertaining
","Wes Anderson's adaptation of Roald Dahl's book is clever, audacious, and a lot of fun. Shot using stop animation, this one-of-a-kind movie has the elegance of both The Nightmare before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach with the quirkiness you'd expect from an Anderson film. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray lend distinctive voices to a witty, delicious script.Mr. Fox (Clooney) is an unrepentant thief until he makes a promise to Mrs. Fox (Streep) that he'll quit for good (after he informs him that she's pregnant) if they escape a farmer's trap. They do, and he makes good on the promise, moving the family from their underground home to an isolated tree near three vicious, desperate super farmers. But it's not long before Mr. Fox is pining to pull off One More Job, which turns into several more jobs, with the help of Kylie the opossum.However, the three farmers aren't your typical placid farmfolk, they're vengeful jerks, so after Mr. Fox makes off with much of their birds and cider, they vow revenge, which includes using a backhoe to remove not only the tree but also a huge chunk of the earth.There's also an interesting subplot involving Mr. Fox's son Ash (Schwartzman), who feels that his parents think he's worthless and that he can't possibly compete with the super-debonair Mr. Fox. Ash is at that awkward age anyway, so dealing with his famed dad isn't easy. Then, on top of that, Ash's cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) arrives for an extended stay, and he's perfect in virtually everything. So poor Ash can't measure up to his dad OR his cousin.What makes this movie really work, though, is the magnificent animation style. We've all seen those old Rankin-Fitch Christmas classics, right? This is sort of like that, only even more stylized and fluid. The film was shot at a rate of 12 frames per second, rather than the standard 24, so that viewers could really see the actual stop-motion animation process itself. And the result is that the movie feels more organic, more natural, and more poetic.A Wes Anderson movie is usually oddly endearing anyway, but this one is exceptional in its uniquity. The set pieces are dazzling (for example, the hair on the humans is from actual human hair, from the movie's crew), and the backgrounds are meticulous works of art. Neat trivia: Mr. Fox's study is a faithful recreation of Roald Dahl's garden hut, where he wrote most of his beloved books.It's fun seeing Clooney in a role he's best suited to anyway, the devilish rogue. (One gets the feeling sometimes that he'd really like to be James Bond.) Mr. Fox is certainly not without his flaws (need for spotlight, need to be right, delusions of grandeur), but his heart belongs to his family and to the other woodland creatures. The characters are nuanced just enough for kids to grasp their intentions and attitudes while not being too simplistic for adults to enjoy.",8,0,1,3 December 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," Heart-racing, pulse-quickening fun
","I ask you, could anyone BUT Bruce Willis play John McClane? Of course not. Even twelve years after his last appearance, McClane is still the all-American, G.I. Joe, Bad Guy killah with a soft spot for his family but also for Doing the Right Thing. Here, he's up against a madman (Timothy Olyphant) bent on virtually hacking his way into the U.S. infrastructure to prove some kind of point, or something. Whatever. It doesn't matter. All that matter is that McClane kicks ass. That's all we want to see.All McClane has to do, see, is pick up a kid in Camden, New Jersey, and schlep him down to Washington in the middle of the night. Sounds like a job for a rookie cop, right, but of course a senior detective was requested. And it seems this kid, Matt Farrell (Justin Long) is some kind of super-sekrit hacker dude person who's wanted for questioning by the FBI, something about a major attack on government computers earlier that day. Of course, other people are looking for Farrell (i.e., the bad guys), and they blow everything up trying to get him and, by extension, McClane. They fail.Then the madman, Thomas Gabriel, sets his evil, evil plan further in motion by causing all of the traffic lights in DC to go green. Cackling with glee, he causes the stocks at the NYSE to plummet! Mass chaos ensues! Meanwhile, McClain's trying to shepherd his young charge to various government offices, trying to find a safe place for him. There aren't any.Of course, at some point it gets personal between McClane and Gabriel, so the bad guy nabs McClane's teenage daughter, Lucy. Why do bad guys do this? Do they really think the hero will be all, 'Oops, you win, I give up!' because his family's in jeopardy? Don't evil villains watch movies? Gabriel's lucky, though, because he has a chief minion who can kick ass, Mai (Maggie Q). Naturally, at some point she goes womano-a-mano with McClane, but the only reason she does as well as she does is that a) she's a woman, so she's not your typical henchman and b) she knows kung fu. I mean, of course she does, she's Asian. They all know that stuff, right? A lot of things blow up. You might have seen the trailer, in which McClane speeds a cop car out of a tunnel, and jumps out at the last minute as the car slams into the side of a hovering helicopter. Pretty nifty stuff, if not even a little believable. Often, McClane will do something that winds up hurting him pretty bad, with blood dripping down his face and all, but he's fine, no, let him just walk it off.. or jump down a flight of stairs, or run down the street. It's all good, because he's the hero. We expect him to shrug off pain and injury to vital organs. But when the pilot of the chopper falls at least thirty feet and is perfectly okay, I dunno, I'm a little skeptical.But it's okay, because little implausibilities won't bother you. The thing to note is that Willis, his smirk, his I-ain't-taking-no-crap attitude, they're all back. And, good news, there aren't a lot of side comments about McClane's age, mostly because he kicks the asses of people half as old. Willis looks like he's still in tip top fighting shape. He's not paunchy, or graybearded. He looks a lot like he did in 1995, so good on him.Wonderful visual effects and another gritty, appealing, and above all fresh performance from Willis, who clearly looks into the role - he's not sleepwalking through it, as you might expect an aging action star to do, just collecting a paycheck. I swear, the man looks like he's enjoying getting shot at. He rocks. But it wouldn't matter how into the role Willis was if the plot was too convoluted to follow, or too simplistic to warrant attention, or if the rest of the cast was so wooden that you kind of wished they'd all get mowed down. And that's where Long came in. Part victim, part sidekick, total hacker, Long was perfectly cast, a good complement - useful without being annoying. Tough to find people like that in action movies.",8,1,3,1 July 2007
Moonrise Kingdom," Rarefied elegance
","In Moonrise Kingdom, two kids on a remote New England island, from disparate backgrounds, decide to make a break for it, running away from their parents and Boy Scout troop, respectively. Wes Anderson's quirky, stylish romantic comedy-drama is pleasant, with all the usual off-beat trappings. It is both tender and amusing and infinitely relatable for anyone who remembers being a preteen and wishing to escape.In 1965, Jared Gilman plays Sam, a Scout member. He's disliked by the other boys, probably because of his over-sized glasses and overactive intellect. His scoutmaster is played by the redoubtable Edward Norton. One morning, when Sam does not show up for the camp's breakfast, Scoutmaster Ward discovers that the boy has left in the middle of the night. He calls in Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), who canvasses the island and informs the Bishops (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand), just in case they see the boy. And soon thereafter, wouldn't you know it, but their rebellious daughter Suzy (Kara Hayward), is also missing. And so a manhunt is afoot.The most delightful aspect of this movie is that it, like Stand by Me before it, feels as if it's viewed directly through the perspective of young kids. Some adults are nice, some are not. Other kids can be mean. You can count on yourself and few others. Both Suzy and Sam come from unorthodox homes with some measure of regiment, and through the power of being pen pals, decide on a complex plan of action.But this isn't just a movie about two kids on the lam. It's about people discovering themselves, allowing themselves to be reborn as better scoutmasters, better parents, better cops. It's about young love's slow blossoming. It is not about physical intimacy. It's a genuine, honest, and deeply enchanting, colored in luxuriant blues and yellows and earth tones, peppered with the staccato speech of a scoutmaster and the angst of a police officer, and drenched in some terrific character acting. Hayward and Gilman are better than you would expect from neophytes; much, much better. Their pain, their loss, their love, their gain, their everything - we feel it all right there with them. It helps that Anderson has assembled a top-notch cast, even if none of them really get a lot of screen time. Willis, McDormand, and an almost- unrecognizable Harvey Keitel are all standouts. The story moves lightning quick, pausing only to show us tender moments in stark contrast to the mad dash to find the fleeing duo. It's a given that we're to root for the kids, but the adults are by no means presented as evil-doers who wish to punish their offspring. This is a movie that teaches us by allowing us to relive our own childhoods and see the choices laid out before us. And, like any kind-hearted movie, it shows us that love is a shining thing.Although I enjoyed Anderson's whimsical atmosphere set against some fairly serious backgrounds, including children in danger and even blood, I liked this movie first and foremost because of the dead-on performances of Gilman and Hayward, two stars in the making. Their chemistry is palpable; they are simultaneously a mismatched couple and two meant to be together.",8,1,2,14 January 2013
RED," I'd like to marry Dame Helen
","The thing is, I usually have high expectations for Bruce Willis movies. Stuff's gonna get blowed up. I like that. I also have an affinity for movies involving multiple Oscar-nominated actors. But too often I'm disappointed. The actors have no chemistry, and the stuff blowing up is of little consequence. But Red was different. I found it impressively exciting – a fairly straightforward plot helped along by fun, inventive effects and truly wonderful acting.Willis plays Frank Moses, a retired former CIA agent who happens to be falling in love with the voice of the woman (Mary-Louise Parker) who's responsible for making sure his pension checks are sent. Frank intentionally rips up his checks just so he can call back and talk to Sarah some more. Okay, that's a little weird, but innocuous enough.Shortly after introduced to Frank and Sarah, a hit squad shows up at Franks home and basically destroys it, and thus our hero is on the run from whoever. He naturally travels to Kansas City to find Sarah, because he's pretty sure that the baddies who went after him had been monitoring his longish conversations with said bureaucratic wonk. Sarah's not exactly down with this strange man visiting her in the middle of the night and then taking her on a Grand Adventure, but since we know Frank's a good guy, we're sure she'll come around.Turns out, quickly enough, that someone is out to kill not only Frank but members of his old team, something about an event that occurred in Guatemala in 1981. The team, all retired, reunites to figure out what the bejeepers is going on. Frank tracks down Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin (John Malkovich) and brings in Victoria (Helen Mirren), formerly of MI6. Object: break into their former place of work (CIA!) and find out what's what.Pretty standard stuff. Will the romance between Sarah and Frank? Will the team discover a Grander Conspiracy that involves some of the highest-ranking people in American politics? Will all of the team members survive? Will we discover that the guy who's supposed to take them down (Karl Urban) isn't, in fact, the baddest bad guy? Easy to figure out. But that's not the kind of movie this is supposed to be, one that needs figuring. It's an action movie with touches of comedy and quite a bit of surprising heart.The biggest asset that the movie has is its cast. It's not typical for actors who have done well by themselves in other movies to become a cohesive unit in an ensemble movie like this. Sometimes the actors try to outshine – outact – each other, as if to prove they are just that good. As a result, the movie suffers; the plot is relegated to the background, and everyone chews scenery. End of story.Ain't so here. These guys seem like they're long-lost friends. Willis and Freeman were infamously in the terrible Bonfire of the Vanities some twenty years ago, and Malkovich and Mirren sort of worked on The Hitchhiker's Guide, but that's about it. Mirren herself is really exceptional – no surprise – as a sharpshooter with her own colorful past.Any movie that makes me realize how awesome even dumb movies can be is a winning movie. Red is an escapist movie. You don't watch it to see an intricate mystery; you go to see a slam-dunk, bang-up good time. And that's what you get.",7,2,6,17 October 2010
Flight," Best Supporting Actor: the plane
","I had high hopes for Flight, no pun intended. It looked solid. Denzel Washington as a heroic pilot who may have other, deeper issues? Sounded good to me. Sounded almost like Oscar bait, even. But it's not. It's about fifteen minutes of awesome (at the beginning) and ten minutes of solid sweetness (at the end) and them more than an hour of crap. Washington tries hard (sometimes way too hard), but his character is so incredibly unlikeable that when the expected epiphany occurs I didn't feel empathy toward him, I felt relief that it was finally, blissfully over.Washington is Whip Whitaker, an experienced airline pilot. Flying out of Atlanta, he encounters some severe weather but manages to thread a needle through the clouds to clear skies. Problem averted until about half an hour later, when the plane begins to fall apart. Whip pulls off an interesting, unfathomable maneuver, flying the plane upside down for a short time to arrest an extremely steep descent. The plane crashes, and nearly everyone survives. But there's more to the story - had Whitaker been drinking prior to flying?Yes, it's a FWI (flying while intoxicated) movie, and suddenly it's not about the awesome crash but rather the character of one Captain Whitaker. It's about his fall, rise, fall, fall, fall, fall, rise?, fall, and so on from grace, with the help of a lawyer (Don Cheadle), his best friend (John Goodman), an ex-junkie (Kelly Reilly), and a union rep (Bruce Greenwood). Will Whip rise to the occasion, or will he sink further into decline, hastening his own demise? There's a hearing coming up with the NTSB. Will Whip give it all he's got, and then some, for the sake of his own life, those of his kid and ex-wife, and those of the wreck's survivors? A little while into the movie, you realize these questions are not only moot, they're boring. Whitaker is a jerk. He's a charmer, sure, but essentially he's a selfish jerk who rebuffs everyone's attempts to help them (even if they're cynically doing so to save their own careers), until...well, you probably know until when, because the movie follows the blueprint of every down-in-the-bottom-and-then-redeemed story to date. If you enjoy watching Denzel Washington in any movie, this is your movie - because it's any movie, you see. If you enjoy seeing Denzel Washington mumble like a person who's learned that people mumble when they're drunk, this is also your movie. He doesn't act so much as pretend to be a character, and here he thinks that character is Denzel Washington, Drunk Guy. He stumbles, he mumbles, he mutters, he stutters, and that's about it. In most of Washington's movies, he's the one carrying the film. Here, he's surrounded by a very capable cast, and they prop him up like a cigar-store Indian. Cheadle and Greenwood have great scenes together, Reilly is a wonderful find (I didn't realize she was British - excellent southern US accent), and Goodman not only steals his scenes, it's almost as if he's acting in an entirely different movie altogether.I wouldn't recommend Flight. Despite previews that almost make it seem like an action movie, or at least a psychological drama, it's neither of them. It's a standard-issue hard-luck story, but by the end you might not care whether the main character overcomes his obstacles or not, and that's a death knell for movies like this.",4,95,190,4 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The perfect way to end it
","Yes indeed, it's all over. The eighth and final Harry Potter movie is perhaps the best of the entire lot, as it seamlessly mixes fantastic action with intricate exposition. It satisfactorily completes the story, tying up all essential loose ends, and leaves you with a sense of acceptable finality. It's a textbook example of how to finish a film series.HP 7a begins right where the HP 7a left off, a departure from the other films (which dove almost right into a major action scene). I liked that, because even though the final book was split into two movies, for the sake of continuity it's best to think of them as one long, long movie. This continuity allowed us to remain in sync with the characters and their plight, rather than removing us from the action.Harry is still on the lookout for the remaining Horcruxes, objects into which Voldemort has placed portions of his soul. He, along with Ron and Hermione, have left Hogwarts, which is now under the ruthless rule of one Professor Snape, who may or may not have had something to do with the death of the last headmaster (Dumbledore). Snape may or may not be working for the Dark Lord; it's something that's been ambiguous for many movies now. Meanwhile, Voldemort is assembling his forces and, knowing the prophecy that says only he or Harry may live, seeks his enemy's demise.There are two major, long scenes in the movie: one involves a break in (and break out) of the goblin bank Gringotts, and the other is the epic Battle of Hogwarts. Both seem terrifyingly real, especially when viewed in IMAX 3D. I don't often go for the IMAX experience, or for 3D, but this was a good choice. Director Peter Yates made great use of the technology.I think the movie is fairly true to the book, with only some minor changes. For example, the character of Crabbe, one of Draco Malfoy's buddies, doesn't appear in the movie - because the actor who played him had had a drug conviction, thus necessitating a script change. But for the most part, things are as they were in the book.The most touching moments are the quiet, sometimes unexpected ones. There are many times during the movie when characters feel that they could die at any moment, so they say and do things believing there may not be time later on. The terrific cast - especially the younger actors - is compelling as always, believable not only as witches and wizard but as loving, feeling human being just like us.Of course, the biggest emotional moment takes place in the Forbidden Forest, an ethereal scene that brings back a lot of memories for Harry; it's somewhat reminiscent of the cave scene on Dagobah in The Empire Strikes Back, except that in this case the scene propels the plot and serves as an emotional counter to all the battling going on around it.There are no major flaws in this movie, and the minor ones are inconsequential. The film maintains its sense of urgency, seriousness, and dark attitude; you genuinely feel as if the fate of the world rests on this manchild with a lightning scar. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is a beautiful, elegant coda to a long-running series that began as a kids' movie and became more mature as it progressed, much like its youthful main cast.",9,0,4,17 July 2011
Final Destination," Only visions I ever see are more slasher movies...
","It looks like an interesting movie, doesn't it? High-school kid has horrible vision of an exploding plane while his plane's sitting on the runway, freaks out, and leaves the plane, taking a few classmates and a teacher with him. Boom! Plane explodes. Did the kid save them, or is he just off his rocker? Don't look for anyone you recognize in the cast. I've watched about a billion movies, and I recognized only the last guy I listed up there (Tony Todd, from Candyman). Basically, this is a movie in the young-people-scared-out-of-their-wits vein that was popularized with the Scream films. This one, fortunately, is well-written, albeit with some plot holes. Still, it's an intriguing premise. Does Death have a plan for each of us? If so, then this kid's act of getting people off the plane screwed it up royally, and now Death's really ticked off and - surprise! - one by one, the survivors are picked off. But this is a tiny cut about the standard people-being-killed-one-by-one movie. It's not just a matter of how people are killed in this movie; that would be the easy, tried-and-true method. In Final Destination, the fun is in figuring out who's next, and if the premise is to be believed (that Death does have a plan), then the mystery of who is supposed to die next will keep you guessing. There's some pleasure in figuring out who's next, since there are some characters you kind of hope get it sooner rather than later. That said, the acting is nothing to speak of - rather bland, really - and the direction itself is really bad. But the story's interesting and the effects, gory as they are, are frighteningly realistic. PRO: Story, effects. You want blood, you got it! CON: Acting, directing, effects. This is NOT for squeamish people. My score: 6",6,0,0,30 March 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Classic!
","To say that this is an epic movie might be an understatement, especially in a time when movies such as Armageddon, Independence Day, and The Hulk are considered to be 'epic' movies. True epic movies, you see, have not only bombast and pomp but also portend Great Importance. An epic movie is one that establishes a tone of deep meaning, not harmless fluff.And so it is with all three of the Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), we learn of a bad of nine travelers with the task of returning the One Ring to the fires of Mount Doom, from which the adornment was made. In The Two Towers (2002), we follow their travails as some of the members split up, with returning the ring still the ultimate goal. Now, with The Return of the King, we see their tales told in full. Will Frodo and Sam make it to Mount Doom, past the gigantic army of orcs, without the Lidless Eye spotting them? Will Aragorn (the King of the title) be able to rally enough troops to forestall the orc attacks? Will any of the original Fellowship fall along the way, to be forgotten except in hobbit songs evermore?The story thread picks up right where The Two Towers left off. Frodo (bearing the ring) and Sam are now separated from the rest of their crew and are on a singular mission to return the ring to its foundry. With them is Gollum, a former hobbit whose long possession of the One Ring has driven him completely mad and has transformed his appearance into that of some underground netherworld creature, rather than a jolly hobbit.Meanwhile, Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Leglolas arrive at Orthanc, the tower formerly held by Saruman (the evil wizard). Saruman's been deposed by the Ents, a race of sentient trees headed by Treebeard. With Treebeard are two more of the original Fellowship: the hobbits Merry and Pippin.Doom is approaching. Sauron's minions are assembling massive orc armies to overrun the entire area, hoping to bring about the end of the Age of Man. It's up to Aragorn and the gang to save the day.Each of the three movies has been an absolute joy to watch. Even if one has never read one word of J.R.R. Tolkien, one is very quickly drawn into the story, into the world of Middle-Earth. Even if one cannot tell an orc from a Balrog, one can follow the sometimes complicated storylines. This is because director Peter Jackson does an incredible job of explaining things without getting bogged down in the myriad details that Tolkien's epic book (or books) provided.As with most epic movies, this one grabs you in two distinct places: the heart and the mind. The audience is properly mesmerized as the soldiers of Gondar race to the aid of those of Rohan, as the orc legions attack the castle at Minas Trith. All of the scenes, from the quiet, underplayed exchanges between Sam and Frodo to the wild, chaotic war, were suitably jam-packed with emotion. You'd have to be quite the zombie not to fall completely under the spell of these movies, especially these characters.While Jackson took a few liberties with the plot (as he did in The Two Towers), none of the changes detracted from the movie itself. Because Tolkien's fantasy epic was so chock full of nuance, it was inherently necessary to chop some of them from the movie. Film as a medium is more conducive to images than to facts and other details.This was not a movie that one could simply watch and cheer the good guys on lustily. This movie drew one in so deeply that you lived and breathed as the characters lived and breathed. When Frodo is attacked by the spider Shelob, you jump with him. You feel it when he's injected with her poison. When the orcs are attacking the castle with their war machines and their oliphaunts (think mastadons), you cringe with the denizens of the city of kings. As an audience, you never feel detached from the action.But in addition to all the mesmerizing, eye-popping action, there were a great many tearful scenes. I mean scenes so powerful that only the most robotic among us could look away without shedding a tear. There were plenty of sniffles and tears in our theater the other day. Fantastic evocative performances by everyone in the cast, especially Sean Astin as Sam, Billy Boyd as Pippin, David Wenham as Faramir, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Oh, and definitely the great Ian McKellen as Gandalf.Not a dry eye in the place. The sweet, gentle ending was as poignant an ending as I've ever seen in a movie. The ending, by the way, ties everything up nicely - but not too nicely. And, it's important to note, it ends just as the book does.The movie is as close to perfection as possible, with the two tales of Frodo and Sam and the orc attacks neatly dovetailing, then culminating at the same time. And the editing is never jarring, even though quite a bit had to be cut in order for the film to be released - and it's still nearly 3.5 hours long!The Return of the King is a beautiful masterpiece, a pinnacle of moviemaking. It will certainly be up for a few Oscars come March, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were listed in the National Film Registry some year as one of the greatest American films of all time.",9,5,13,27 April 2004
The Purge," A little of the ultraviolence
","In the future (the year 2022), crime is essentially nonexistent and the unemployment rate is 1%. But one night a year, the country's fine citizens are permitted to commit any crime they wish, without penalty, including murder. It's the ultimate way to blow off steam. Twelve hours of mayhem, and then the population surplus is reduced. That's life with The Purge.The Purge - the event, not the movie - is sold as a good thing, something that keeps everyone in harmony for the other 364 days in the year. No crime? Almost everyone's employed? All due to The Purge, apparently. Some see it with a more cynical eye, though; those who can afford to defend themselves, their family, and their property against the onslaught of violence will probably be just fine. But those who live in the poorer sections of their city...well, they're there to be Purged.James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) lives with his family in a gated community. James sells security systems, which as you might guess becomes a lucrative business around the time of The Purge each year, on March 21. The Sandin family has a very nice, expansive house, nestled among a plethora of other 'haves.' Thus James, wife Mary (Lena Headey), son Charlie (Max Burkholder), and daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) feel safe, removed from the anarchy of the annual ritual.Until, of course, a still-unsure-if-he-supports-The-Purge Charlie decides, after the sirens have signaled the beginning of the madness, to let a bloody homeless man (Edwin Hodge of As Above, So Below) into their home. Ooh, bad call. See, some devout, well-armed Purgers are looking for the guy, and sure enough the Sandins' neighbors have ratted them out as harboring the guy. Does James hand over the man, or do the mercenaries take the house by force? Like You're Next, The Purge centers on a group of people being attacked unexpectedly. James does have weapons, but it's quickly apparent that his security system is more of a nominal deterrent than anything. The villains find it surprisingly easy to get inside. And with the lights out - yep, no power except for the generator that's somehow powering only the multiple cameras - and the family separated from each other, it's utter chaos at Chez Sandin.Also like You're Next, there's a nifty twist at the end. Sort of makes up for plot holes or just missing information. Here's a question: Since all weapons at Level 4 and below are legal during The Purge (and presumably illegal the rest of the year), how do law-enforcement officials discern whether a higher-grade weapon has been used outside of the annual Purge? It's not explicit in the movie, but I guess crimefighting is just that good in the future. But then I was thinking, what if it's good by virtue of instilling fear in the populace? That might control everyone for much of a year, but when it came time for The Purge, wouldn't cops be the first ones on the firing line? (Note: in a prologue voice-over, we're informed that elected officials have immunity.) The Purge offers some interesting food for thought. Would you be willing to live in a complete police state in order to have a crime-free society with jobs for everyone? On the plus side, you get to steal/vandalize/rape/pillage/murder to your heart's content. On the negative side, you could be the victim of all of that and not live to see another Purge. Kind of a dilemma, eh? But make no mistake, this isn't a movie that dwells on heavy issues. It's a thriller designed to shock and entertain, and to that end The Purge does a bloody good job.",7,0,0,10 September 2014
Munich," Fascinating, unsettling
","Gripping, almost unwatchable drama about the assassinations of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, West Germany. Steven Spielberg's narrative is never complacent, and it never seems to take the easy way out, choosing not to portray either side as completely good or bad.Told from the viewpoint of Avner (Eric Bana, who looks like a younger Liam Neeson), a man charged by Israel to avenge the deaths of the athletes - no matter what the cost. Avner is given a small group of men with which to carry out his task: Kill all 11 members of the terrorist group Black September.Although not quite as evocative or provocative (to me) as Spielberg's earlier Schindler's List, Munich is compelling nonfiction, crisply moving Avner and his crew from target to target and juxtaposing his thirst for revenge with his thoughts of his family, including his newborn daughter. Spielberg does a good job, too, of compelling the viewer to care about Avner, even while the latter mows down bad men using guns and bombs and other toys.The movie is unsettling, probably much more so if you remember the events of the 1972 Olympics, which I do not. In fact, considering I am not Jewish and do not remember those events, this movie still unnerved me quite a bit. One of the recurring themes is the old 'eye for an eye' mantra that pops up in any revenge tale. Which is preferred - sinking to the level of our enemies, or rising above it? It's not a question that's easily answered.Bana is very good as Avner, as is Geoffrey Rush (whom I almost mistook for James Woods) as Avner's liaison with Mossad. There's not a slacker in the bunch, though, no insincere performances, no flat notes.The movie manages to be eerily compelling considering that the outcome is already known - that it, in fact, is still fresh in the minds of many people. Schindler's List had the benefit of arriving more than 50 years after the Holocaust, but with the events in Munich so chronologically close, it would have been easy for the story to lose its footing, to perhaps expose itself as propaganda one way or another. But it doesn't. Although it is pro-Israeli, it is not so to the exclusion of anti-Israeli views; to wit, it is not posited as a clear honorable-revenge story with an easily seen resolution.",9,1,1,6 February 2006
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Intense excitement not for younglings
","The second entry in The Hunger Games series is perhaps even better than the first, with strong, layered characters, intrigue, creativity, and a great buildup to a stunning cliffhanger. For me, it was endless entertainment.Let me preface this by saying that I'm not sure that The Hunger Games is really for the younger kids out there. It's grim and violent. After all, it's about kids killing each other for the entertainment of a despot. So, PG-13 rating notwithstanding, you might want to reconsider bringing the kids to this. There are some scenes that could give them nightmares (even more so than Harry Potter).The 75th Hunger Games are upon us, but President Snow (an oily Donald Sutherland) is not pleased that Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) were joint winners the previous year when they appeared to choose death over murder. In particular, Snow reviles Katniss, whom he views as a beacon of hope to the mostly impoverished denizens of Pandem's twelve districts.Katniss and Peeta are to embark upon a victory tour, stopping in each district and reading a quick eulogy to the fallen tributes of the previous games. But they must also put on a front that they are both deeply in love with one another, thus distracting people from their wretched lives, as is the intent of the Games. You might guess that this pretension doesn't go over well with Katniss.The victory tour, however, is only the beginning. More games are afoot, and the lives of Katniss and Peeta are no longer the only ones at stake. There's a hint of unease in the air, particularly among the poorer regions of the land. Is Katniss Everdeen a symbol for rebellion? Some characters return, such as Caesar Flickerman, the Games' host (Stanley Tucci), the flamboyant Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), the designer Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), the cranky drunk Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), and the misnamed Snow. Along with new tributes, we meet a new gamesmaster, Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who takes over for Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) as the Machiavelli/Wizard of Oz.The action is frantic, even more so than in in the first movie, and the obstacles facing Katniss - both emotional and physical - are still more debilitating and oppressive. Even though we - and the players - know that the arena is very much under human control, nothing is predictable.Lawrence, if you can believe it, is better than ever. This time around, we get a little bit more of a look into her psyche, her reserved nature, and her longings. Katniss is as radiant and determined as ever, a fierce and intelligent young woman who is as vulnerable as the rest of us. And that alone makes her an ideal role model for kids, not just girls.A word to the wise - okay, a second word to the wise - in one way this movie reminds me of Back to the Future II. That movie was filmed at the same time as its successor, and although it is a fun movie in itself, it transparently served as a lead-in to Back to the Future III; similarly, this movie will not end as decisively as the first but rather on a dramatic, but satisfying precipice. It is a rare film that can tell a tale fluidly and not just leave the audience wanting more of the same but wanting to know precisely what happens in the seconds after the screen goes black. Catching Fire acts as both a wild ride of joy, despair, love, anger, and revenge and as a catalyst for the third and final installment.",9,1,19,5 December 2013
Godzilla," Definitely thrillin'
","You know, I did like the original 1954 Godzilla, but part of me saw it more as a tongue-in-cheek monster movie of the time than as a straight- up horror film. And when the oh-so-American version came out in 1998, I saw that one as almost a comedy, and not in a good way. But this one? This new version of the oft-told tale is downright terrifying, combining a plausible origin with sterling special effects and not one but three really big monsters.Our story begins in the Phillippines in 1999. Scientists are called to a mine in which a huge skeleton has been unearthed; within this skeleton are two pods - one broken open, with a trail leading to the sea. Not long after, unusual seismic activity is recorded at the Janjira nuclear power plant in Japan. The plant's operator, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) sends his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and her team down into the core to check the sensors. But then there's this big explosion, and Sandra and the other scientists in the core are trapped. Publicly, the disaster, which affects all of Japan, is attributed to a 6.3-magnitude earthquake.Some 15 years later, the Brodys' son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a Navy bomb-disposer guy, to use the technical term, and he's a bit estranged from his dad, who's become obsessed with finding out the true reason for the so-called earthquake. Shortly after Ford returns home to San Francisco to be with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam, he learns that Papa Joe has been arrested in Japan for trespassing on the grounds of the old, now-quarantined plant. Joe insists that there was no earthquake, that an electromagnetic pulse was behind the disaster. And he may be right, because while Ford is in Japan collecting his dad, there's another incident, and a gigantic winged creature flees the scene. No, it's not Godzilla, but he's around somewhere.Fret not; Gozdilla does show up, and when he does it's a real heart stopper. He's not King Kong tall, he's more like ten or eleven King Kongs tall. He's Kanye's ego tall. He's Donald Sterling's racism tall. He's a big fella, is what I'm getting at here. Anyway, he and Winged Monster (called a MUTO, for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) are soon joined by another creepy dude, who's like Winged Monster although without wings. They both sort of look like the monster from Cloverfield, come to think of it, but much more realistic.Would it be spoiling things if I noted that all three beat the heck out of each other? Probably not. It's also not a spoiler to note that the armed forces attempt to use everything from handguns to tank ordnance on our friendly neighborhood monsters, to little avail. Nuclear weapons are mentioned. This is such a visceral movie. There's little in the way of shaky-cam cinematography, and you almost never get a full-on look at any of the monsters. This is good, because it highlights how damn huge these guys are; if you or I were there, we wouldn't be able to fully comprehend their colossal stature without moving back, oh, a couple hundred miles. All of this makes the movie feel very much real and as if you're very much in the middle of things, 3D or not. The CGI is worlds better than it was for Roland Emmerich's 1998 dud.There are plenty of jaw-dropping moments of terror, and there are a multitude of on-screen deaths, PG-13 rating or not. There's always this lingering feeling of being trapped. After all, you can't go into the water (Godzilla swims!), and you can't go into the city (Godzilla smash!), and you can't even go into the mountains, because these guys are tall, tall, tall. How tall? Grande from Starbucks tall. So you're trapped, and you can't figure out how to stop them, since bullets don't work. Turns out it's not complicated, but I'll let you see for yourself on that score. Anyway, although I watched the 3D version of this, I don't think the 3D added much to the experience. It didn't take away from it (that is, it wasn't distracting), but it did seem needless in retrospect. But the bottom line for me is that Godzilla is a lot less campy and much, much scarier than the version from olden times (1954). Think World War Z without zombies or the ability to zip around from continent to continent. Okay, so technically here we move between North America and Asia, but you get the idea.",8,5,9,31 May 2014
Looper," Super Looper
","It's not fair to simply call Looper a brainy time-travel movie, because it's so much deeper than that. It's like Inception, only much less convoluted; provocative without being overwrought. It's the odd time- travel movie that understands the limitations inherent in the genre and not only doesn't gloss over them, it embraces them and makes them part of the fun. I found it so engrossing that I actually overthought one element of the story, thinking it meant something when it turned out not to. The year is 2044, and life sucks just about everywhere. Cities are slums. Even cornfields aren't safe from ravaging hobos. It's bleak, like most futures are in the movies. Time travel, we're told, hasn't been invented yet. But by 2074, it will have been. And in 2074, the government is so on top of things that the bleakness of 2044 looks Paradisal by comparison. They outlaw time travel so that only outlaws can time travel. In this case, that would be organized crime. When they want someone to disappear permanently like, they send him back in time to 2044, where an assassin shoots him dead. Much more fun than dumping his body in the Pine Barrens. This erases all trace of the dearly departed. Clean, tidy.The assassins are called Loopers. They don't know who they're shooting. Their prey arrives on a blanket at a particular time and place, head covered in a bag, hands bound. The Looper shoots, turns the victim over, and claims his pay in silver bars, which are big in 2044. Loopers have one standing order: don't let your man get away. Shoot to kill. Even if he's you. And that's the crux of this thriller, when Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds himself face to face with...well, himself. His 2074 self, Old Joe (Bruce Willis). Yup, that's who the mob's sent back. This is known as closing the loop, and it means your contract's been terminated. Oh, you can live your life as long as you want, but you won't be a cold assassin anymore, which kind of stinks. At any rate, there's more to it than just a loop closure. Old Joe promptly escapes his execution and is a man on a mission. He needs to kill someone in 2044 so that they don't become someone bad in 2074. That's a mission we can all get behind, right?Young Joe, for lack of a better distinction, has troubles of his own. First, he isn't supposed to be free, what with his victim getting away (the entire city is looking for him). Second, he's a junkie, hooked on some future drug that you drop into your eyeballs. His own men are looking for him, he needs to find Bruce Willis, and what the heck does all of this have to do with the future, anyway? Man, a whole lot, it turns out, a whole lot. Let me put it this way. At first, you think Old Joe is just on a personal vendetta - which he is. But it's more than that. What he wants to do could make things a heck of a lot better in good ol 2074. But that conflicts with what Young Joe has in mind, which is to finish his job and take off for France (don't ask).The movie is existential. How did Old Joe get in the position of being sent back by the mob? He IS Joe, after all, and the Joe we know seems to have his head on his shoulders. What happens? Bad stuff, apparently. But back to the existentiality of it all. Let's pose a question - if you had a chance to kill a future terrorist, would you? Is the answer an easy one? What if the baby future terrorist wouldn't become said terrorist if certain branches in his life had led to different conclusions? The old time-travel movies make it much simpler: if you see yourself in the future, that screws things up. If old you kills young you, that means you're dead, too. This movie mashes all of that together and strips out the boring parts. That makes for a really intelligent sci-fi thriller. Tough to find.Twists abound. I can't even begin to describe one without giving away another. Heck, Young Joe's not even a really sympathetic character. I mean, he's a nice guy, but the man sells out his friend within the first ten minutes of the movie, so he's not super awesome. Plus did I mention he's a cold-blooded killer? He is. And he is constantly faced with the consequences, ever unreeling, of not only his actions but those of Old Joe and countless other characters. Turns upon turns, a Moebius strip of plot lines.What's really at the center of the movie, the most terrifying aspect, isn't even touched on until the movie's mostly over. You think the blunderbuss that Young Joe has or the Glock that Old Joe procures are bad-ass weapons? There's another one much worse. I'm talking Stephen King worse. Oh yes.Both Gordon-Levitt and Willis (who do resemble each other here) give commanding, top-notch performances. Earnest without being dull; determined without being infallible. Unheroic, except sometimes. They're strongly supported by Jeff Daniels as Gordon-Levitt's boss, Paul Dano as Young Joe's best friend, and Emily Blunt as the mother of a small, strange child. Looper is an awe-inspiring movie, the one that continues to resonate well after the curtain's fallen. What does it mean? Well, it's easier to pinpoint the meaning here than in movies like The Tree of Life and other New-Age nonsense, but it's the kind of movie that wisely leaves questions unanswered. And the last scene is a powerful, poignant, delicious ending. It ain't the best movie in the world (there are some unanswered questions that really should have been answered), but it's damn good among its genre.",7,2,10,1 October 2012
Get Him to the Greek," A laugh riot in spots
","Get Him to the Greek has moments of riotous hilarity, pockmarked with only a few scenes that try a little too hard to be effectively sentimental. The yin/yang chemistry between Russell Brand as a druggie rock star and Jonah Hill is believable and entertaining, and aside from the typical awkward nonslapstick scenes from writer Judd Apatow, the movie generally works.Aldous Snow (Brand), introduced in 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, is now a washed-up rocker. He's been on the wagon, then off it. His band, Infant Sadness, hasn't played in ten years. Then a young record-company intern named Aaron Green (Hill) gets the idea of having the band reunite for a tenth anniversary show at the famed Greek Theater in Los Angeles. Aaron's high-octane boss Sergio (P. Diddy) instructs his charge to jet to London, gather up Snow and fly him to New York to be on the Today Show, then fly him to LA for the reunion show. Hilarity ensues.It actually does, too. Naturally, Aaron and Aldous are complete opposites – one a party-hardy hedonist and one more of a button-down, take-no-chances drip, one who has many brief encounters with the female kind and one who is just coming out of a long-term relationship. Or so he thinks, anyway. And as much as Aaron wants to get things moving along, Aldous wants to tarry and enjoy life a bit longer, sort of a microcosm of their individual lives up to that point.It's no surprise that each does a little bit of growing up along the way. But we're not meant to focus on that. Instead, Aaron and Aldous experience wacky escapades along the lines of Bachelor Party, with echoes of Pulp Fiction and The Hangover. What makes it all work is that it's not just one zany scene after another; director Nicholas Stoller tosses in some serious moments that are meant to humanize Aldous a bit more and take the edge off a little.The movie as a whole is effective in part because Brand is such a gifted comic who's made the Aldous Snow character his own. Brand as Snow electrifies the room when he walks in, sort of what you'd expect from a glamorous rocker. Even one who has some deep-seated issues of his own. See, the movie moves along pretty damn well when it's concentrating on the wackiness, with a smidge of seriousness thrown in, but when too much focus is diverted to those serious psychological issues, then it sort of crumbles. And it's not just issues with Aldous Snow, either; there are a few that try to work out Aaron's own problems (although for most of the movie he's befuddled and along for the ride, a well-meaning patsy).In particular, there is one scene near the end in which Aldous attempts to help Aaron and his girlfriend Daphne resolve their differences. Like with the more serious scenes in Forgetting Sarah Marshall – also directed by Stoller, and the movie to which this is sort of a sequel – the scene seems pointless and jarring. It's the opposite of what you, as viewer, want to see, as it's neither sexy nor funny nor illuminating.Another slight debit is P. Diddy. The man can play unhinged well, but he's not always funny here – sometimes he just comes off as a mean jerk. And not in the Mr. Dithers (boss of Dagwood Bumstead) way, either, not in the comically inept gangster way, just sort of sour and bitter. A little more work might help him, since I believe this was his first comedic attempt. And for a first attempt, it ain't bad.The bottom line is that Get Him to the Greek is really funny for a good portion of the film, with only a few dips into ill-advised sentimentality that just isn't effective and even helps kill the mood. Both Brand and Hill are well cast and are hysterical.",7,1,3,13 June 2010
Thirteen Days," Gripping real-life drama magnetically told
","Back during the Cold War, life was a little different. Once the USSR became a major world power, there was an intense battle of wills on the parts of both the US and Russia not to get into another war. While previous wars had been fought using conventional warfare, it was common knowledge that the next one would involve nuclear weapons, and would probably be the last war anyone would see. In October of 1962, the Soviets planted missiles on the Communist island of Cuba, a mere 90 miles away from Florida's coast. Those of you who were sentient beings in 1962 must have been apoplectic when you heard that news. Imagine! The Red Menace, which had up till then been as distant as Mars, was now parked in your front yard, tooting the horn. It was probably enough to make you quake in your boots. Americans aren't accustomed to reacting in such a manner, of course; we're the big, bad tough guys of the world. And while up till then a full-blown nuclear attack might have seemed as unthinkable as the Cubs winning the World Series, all of a sudden it was very possible. And people were terrified. But by the time the public found out about the missiles, the White House had been working on the problem for a little while. This film captures the inner-circle machinations that President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy orchestrated to avert thermonuclear war. Was Krushchev seriously trying to initiate a war? Was he trying to scare the US? Was he basically saying, 'We can park these missiles right here and there's nothing you can do about it,' basically making the US look bad to the rest of the world? It was among the most gripping time period's in the brief, eventful history of the United States. The future of not only the country but of the entire world was teetering, and one false move on the part of the level-headed thinkers in America would plunge it into the abyss. To complicate matters, there were two letters purporting to be from the Soviet leader: Were they both fakes? Was the first real, and the second a fraud? Should the US denounce both? And of course, there were certain military leaders in the US who wanted nothing more than to blow the Reds off the planet. The movie is filled with a virtual no-name cast. Bruce Greenwood plays the president, and he was convincing and powerful in his performance. Steven Culp plays Bobby Kennedy, volatile but shrewd, the ultimate diplomat. The only real 'name' in the cast belongs to Kevin Costner, who plays political advisor Kenny O'Donnell. He has the same good-old-boy accent he sported in JFK, but he was a little more emotional than in most of his films. A good move on his part, I'd say. The madness of near-war is an infection to which these prime players seemed immune. It's movies like this that remind one that politics and war planning are not simple textbook exercises; they need to be cultivated from the heart and leashed by the brain.",9,0,0,14 July 2001
300," Cry 'Havoc' and watch this film of war
","Remember those commercials for the US Marines, wherein some ripped young recruit is climbing a mountain, and then he almost falls as he reaches the summit, so he reaches out with a muscular arm and, gritting his teeth and emitting some sort of war cry, he reaches for the mountain and hoists himself up? That's sort of how the entire two hours of 300: men screaming as they stab, fillet, garrote, gut, and impale their enemies on pointy things. It takes two hours because there are so many enemies, and because they're using spears and swords instead of guns.300 is loosely based on a real-life event, the 480 BC defense by a small band of Spartan soldiers of their homeland from a marauding Persian army, led by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). The movie is more directly based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the battle itself, so some liberties are taken, but more importantly the use of the comic as the basis allows the blood and gore to be shown in an almost-surrealistic format, thus enabling the normal (read: not bloodthirsty) viewer to enjoy the film without feeling guilt at seeing so much mayhem.King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) has a tough decision to make. An emissary from Xerxes meets him and tells him that Sparta must bend its knee to its new ruler. Leonidas will have none of this, and soon the messenger and his companions are thrown down a deep pit. Okay, that was an easy decision. Now Leonidas must decide whether to wait for Xerxes' army or to take the fight to the edge of the sea, meeting the enemy there. The trouble is, Sparta is a society with touches of democracy: in order to go to war, Leonidas must get approval from the Council, which isn't inclined to give it. This does not stop our hero-king.The last time I saw an adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel, I was extremely unimpressed - Sin City, I thought, was terrible both technically and creatively. But 300 is different; the blood, which is omnipresent, is stylized, wonderfully imagined, and incredibly detailed, even on a ten-year-old, 27-inch TV set. You can literally see individual drops of blood as they fall from each wound! Some of you are already shaking your heads - 'Um, that's not a good thing, seeing that!' - but you're wrong! Or, you're not wrong, just not the intended audience for 300. The movie, particularly the battle scenes, can be best compared to the fight scene in Kill Bill Vol. 1 in which Uma Thurman takes on the Crazy 88. In that scene, Thurman's Beatrice slices and dices through minions after minions, lopping off limbs with aplomb; it's much the same here in 300, and in each scene the violence is raised (or lowered) to an appropriate cartoonish level.Butler gives a truly commanding performance - perhaps on par with Russell Crowe's turn as Maximus in Gladiator or Mel Gibson's in Braveheart, a true, fearless leader who is well prepared to die to save his country and his land. Leonidas is terrifyingly strong and courageous, an imposing figure even in the eyes of Xerxes, who fancies himself a king-god (at the time, the Persian army was the largest in the world). Leonidas must inspire his countrymen not only to fight for their families and homes but also to follow him to their certain deaths. I mean, come on - 300 soldiers against tens of thousands? It's not an obvious victory. Butler is truly up to the test as the tenacious warrior king, a man who would rather die than be subjugated - a fact that eludes Xerxes until the battles are nearly over.On one level, too, this is a chick flick. I mean, every male actor is bare chested, and he's totally cut. (The actors had to work out using some pretty intense, tortuous methods to get those six-pack abs.) So if you're of the female persuasion and like well-built men, this is a movie for you. Sure, they stab each other a lot, so that might put you off, but look! Half-naked men! You gotta love that, right? And for the men, there's sweet, sweet death of numerous characters, some named, mostly not. In fact, according to IMDb, 585 deaths occur in the movie! Sweet indeed.While Leonidas and his 300 battle to the death, a battle of words takes place back at home. Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) tries valiantly to persuade the Council to send the full Spartan army - Leonidas wasn't permitted to take them, obviously, since the Council hadn't granted permission for war - to help back up their king. To do this, she must work her way around the conniving Theron (Dominic West, who looks a lot like Harry Hamlin and acts like Han Solo gone way bad). And that's fun and all, and Headey is wonderful - and gorgeous and wise - but thankfully these scenes are short and small in number. The battle scenes are the real draw! HA-OH! Although the violence may turn some people off, those who like that sort of thing will be enthralled at its exquisite detail and poetic beauty. Butler is so superb, you want to leap into your TV and follow him to the ends of the Earth.",8,0,1,26 August 2007
The Great Escape," WE'RE not sitting out this war comfortably!
","In one of the first of the multi-superstar war films (following on the heels of the biggest one, The Longest Day), The Great Escape follows the planning and execution of a massive escape attempt from a Nazi POW camp during World War II by Allied prisoners. The determination of these men and the absolute thoroughness of their plan is what's on center stage here. Led by Richard Attenborough (back when he was just an actor, not an Academy award-winning director), the men decide to tunnel out of the camp in three places - this way, if one tunnel is discovered by the Germans, the other two tunnels will still be viable options.Attenborough's not the big star here, though; that honor goes to the young Steve McQueen, with that rebellious smile and blonde locks going a long way toward cementing his own movie superstardom. Oh, and James Garner, and Charles Bronson as a Russian (!), James Coburn, and even Donald Pleasance as a myopic forger. Who will survive the escape? And what will happen to those who do once they've left the walls of the prison?If you're a fan of action, this is a prime movie for you. If you're a fan of suspense, this is also a prime movie for you. Above all, if you're a fan of excellent writing, acting, and direction (by John Sturges), then you'll enjoy this 3-hour opus.",9,4,7,9 January 2000
Pineapple Express," Bud Movie
","As far as adult comedies go, Pineapple Express is a barrel of laughs. Even though it steeps itself in profane drug humor, it has several hysterical moments that, when viewed through a prism of credulity, will have you rolling on the floor with mirth.First off, this is a buddy film. Guys become friends, one guy does something bad to the other guy, they go their separate ways, they get back together, they save the day. This kind of plot is something you see in most other Judd Apatow films (he produced), not to mention most Kevin Smith films. But certainly we're not tuning in for meaningful, deep dialog between two stoners, are we? No, we're here for the gags and the undeniable chemistry between James Franco and Seth Rogen (who co-wrote the movie).I think it's safe to say that if you've liked previous Apatow movies - The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up - and/or previous Rogen-written movies - Superbad - you'll appreciate Pineapple Express all the more. Seems to me that Apatow is trying to restore a long-lost genre, that of the R-rated drug comedy; aside from the American Pie films, most comedies are generic, lame PG-13 films that don't even nudge the envelope. With Apatow and his extended crew, we don't have to sit through another faceless farce if we don't want to.Here's the threadbare plot. Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process server who inadvertently witnesses a murder while outside the home of an oily bad guy (played well by Gary Cole). In his haste to get the bejeezus out of there, Dale hits two cars, one of which belongs to a cop in on the murder. And now Dale has bad guys on his tail. He rushes to the closest compadre he has - Saul Silver (Franco), his dope dealer. This is not a movie, you might guess, where you'll hear moralizing about how drugs are bad, mmkay? Watch this enough times and you'll think pot's the greatest thing since Oreos. Anyway, that's how the shenanigans begin, as both Dale and Saul find themselves on the run.As with most movies, though, this one's probably better appreciated while blitzed out of one's mind. You know how in olden days people would drop acid and then go see 2001: A Space Odyssey? It's sort of like that. Without chemical enhancement, the jokes are hit or miss (but when they hit, they pack a wallop); with it, you'd be giggling through the credits.But regardless, it's not the jokes themselves that make this a fun movie to watch, it's the appeal that Franco and Rogen bring to the screen, not only individually but also as a frantic comic team. In fact, 'frantic' describes the film rather well, as Things Happen to our duo as if shot from a Gatling gun. Rushing from absurd situation to absurder situation is part of what makes something funny, after all, and as long as you don't expect actual logic or adherence to the laws of physics, you'll find this a scream.Pineapple Express is, in fact, senseless hilarity, the very textbook example of a dumb comedy that defiantly wraps itself in wacky banter and incorrigible characters.",7,16,34,24 February 2009
John Wick: Chapter 2," Wick 2: burning the candle at both ends
","Although seeing John Wick #1 isn't essential, it'll probably be helpful to the viewer. Wick, a retired hitman, is called back to service to exact revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his new puppy. In the sequel, he finds that a bounty has been placed on his head and that he owes a Bad Guy for assistance rendered in the past. This leads Mr. Wick into another flurry of murderous rage. As with its predecessor, the plot is pretty easy to follow, and some familiar characters appear. As usual, it's the fight choreography that's the main draw, with a lot of terrific action sequences involving not just gunplay but plenty of hand-to-hand combat. John Wick #2 might not pack the emotional punch of the original, but it makes up for it with some fine supporting performances by Laurence Fishburne, Common, and Ian McShane. You might feel a little punchy yourself after watching what poor Mr. Wick goes through.",6,1,1,30 April 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," Fantastic sound, atmosphere, acting.
","Inside Llewyn Davis is an intimate, well-executed, and honest slice of life. It features a humanistic, heartfelt performance by Oscar Isaac as the titular folk singer, arresting cinematography, and a sharp, tight-fisted script by the Coen brothers, who also directed.It's Greenwich Village in the early sixties, when folk music was either coming into its own or ready to be usurped by a more mainstream genre. Llewyn has no home, drifting from gig to gig and crashing on couch after couch as a matter of design; is vagrancy is his life's plan. Llewyn is at turns a noble soul who exists for the sake of making the music he wants to make and a resentful twerp who mooches off friends just to sustain his unsustainable lifestyle.The movie is only somewhat linear, with closing scenes mirroring opening scenes, and it is told entirely from Llewyn's point of view. The Coen brothers masterfully show us not only Llewyn's perspective but also an outside perspective; this allows us to feel both empathy and loathing toward him.Llewyn is nothing if not complex. The movie does a terrific job of avoiding the usual clichés, such as a down-on-his-luck musician catching a lucky break, or a bitter man having a quick change of heart. It's not that Llewyn is constantly sneering at everyone, holding his poverty up as both a shield and a trophy, it's that he is so multilayered that when he does a kind act or offers some praise or thanks, we don't feel that his doing so is in any way out of character. Llewyn is a self-tortured soul, but unlike caricatures of wandering folkies, he is at his center a realist, albeit a prideful one.During his travels and travails, Llewyn encounters people ranging from the genuine (his singing friends Jim and Jean, played by Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan) to the absurd (a rotund, blustery John Goodman). Oh, and a cat that travels with Llewyn - at least until he can get him or her back to the owner. The encounters with the genuine folks feel just as normal as if you or I encountered them; those with the more absurd of the lot feel perfectly surreal, and when they do end one almost wonders if we've all imagined the encounters through Llewyn himself.The music is beautiful and moving. Isaac himself performs Llewyn's songs, with a sweet, vulnerable voice that offers a touch of soul to Llewyn's otherwise-bleak surroundings. When Llewyn is really on, you can feel his pain leap right off the screen into your brain; when he appears to be going through the motions and not singing from his heart, you can feel the lack of depth that his intended audience also feels. Isaac is just flat-out terrific.Ultimately, it is Isaac and the music that push this film into the territory of great cinema. The story itself is stark, moody, unyielding - just like a New York City winter, really. And the movie, like Llewyn's own life, appears to have no point - except to illustrate just how pointless Llewyn is making his life, through his stubborn marriage to his craft and a desire to stay uprooted",9,95,136,11 December 2013
Sin City," Awful from start to blessed finish
","The most striking aspect of Sin City, aside from its amazing cinematography, is that it's in the wrong medium entirely. Based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City manages to be both provocative and ridiculous, and to achieve the former it requires that the viewer not only suspend disbelief but throw it out of the window of a moving car over a large body of water.The movie is split into three stories that overlap each other slightly: 'The Hard Goodbye,' 'The Big Fat Kill,' and 'That Yellow Bastard.' All of them take place in a mythical hellhole called Basin City, whose appellation is, of course, shortened by all who reference it, given the death and sex and violence and other varied depravities that take place in it.In the first story, Marv (Mickey Rourke) is an ugly, scarred thug who wakes up to find that the girl next to him in bed, Goldie (Jaime King) has been murdered during the night - and that the cops are on their way to get him for the crime. Marv doesn't go quietly, naturally, and vows not to rest until he's found Goldie's killer and avenged her. The second story is about an ex-photographer (Clive Owen) who - with the help of gun-totin', knife-wielding hookers - kills a cop and then has to cover up the crime. And the third story is about an honest-joe cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who saves a little girl from molestation and death - but is himself framed for the crime.If the movie had been presented in realistic animated form, it would have been such an easier sell. When I watch a cartoon, I know that the anvil landing on Wile E. Coyote's head isn't hurting the poor canine. But I do expect that most of the laws of physics should apply - if the coyote throws something into the air, it will indeed come down eventually. When I watch a live-action movie, I expect every one of the laws of physics to apply - or, at least when they don't quite follow those rules, my brain doesn't register it and instead focuses on the nifty special effects.But this movie is kind of stuck in the middle. Marv runs *at* a speeding police car and jumps at it, his legs driving into the windshield. Okay, if that were a cartoon I wouldn't give it a second thought. If it were a live-action movie, I might - unless Marv were some supervillian bent on world domination and his ability to jump into windshields at 80 mph could thus be explained. But because he wasn't - he's just some giant schlub with a lot of scars - my brain immediately did a double take - 'Huh? Wha?' Aside from logic, there's the dialog itself. In comic books - sorry, graphic novels - the dialog is *supposed* to be melodramatic, even stilted, especially when the story is set in a noirish age (think 1940s New York City). But in a live-action movie, this just plain doesn't work. Indeed, the dialog was completely unconvincing and insincere; it sounded more fitting for the back of a cereal box. Miller's dialog was childish and absurd; at no point did his words allow me to buy into the entire concept of a 'translated' graphic novel. (Example: On two occasions someone utters, 'Yeesh!' in reaction to some kinda bloody mess. Who in the world says 'Yeesh'? Honestly.) The very first scene - a meeting between Hartigan and his partner, Bob (Michael Madsen) was howlingly awful, and I initially thought the dialog was intentionally being exaggerated for (melo)dramatic effect. Then I quickly discovered that the entire movie was going to be like that, that this wasn't some sly commentary about how awful the dialog was in old-time mystery films.Given that Robert Rodiguez co-directed (with Miller) and that Quentin Tarantino was listed as a 'guest director,' I expected some wit, even if it were in the form of gallows humor. Sadly, none was to be found, and the movie was instead as soulless and empty as the denizens of Sin City itself. The bad guys weren't charming, the good guys weren't normal, and even the reverse wasn't true. No one was likable, which is a good thing in a purportedly gritty crime drama, but neither was anyone unlikeable; the fact is, I didn't care anything about the characters one way or another, and that's a serious misstep on the part of the screenwriter.Far too long (124 minutes, but it felt like five hours), Sin City misfired for me on all cylinders. Booze, broads, and bullets (to take a phrase from the film) are all great, but even the explosions and gun-play - not to mention scads of scantily clad women holding said guns - couldn't overcome the vast pile of ineptitude in nearly all aspects of the movie, from casting to dialog to pacing to good IL' fashioned logic. Only saving grace is the excellent cinematography, but it's not enough to rescue an abysmal effort.",1,15,35,1 May 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," Cabin in the Woods, that is where we are...
","The Cabin in the Woods is never quite what it seems, which is precisely, exactly what you want a suspense-horror movie to be. You don't show the slashing! You don't show the thing that's coming at you! You hide things in shadows, under layers, beneath covers, physically and, more importantly, psychologically. Consequently, the movie messes with your mind, annihilates any preconceived notions you may have about the genre, and the invites a cataclysm of morbid monstrosities into your living room. It's an honest-to-goodness scary movie.Cowritten by Joss Whedon, the movie follows a pretty standard premise: a group of five stereotypes journey to a remote cabin for the weekend, and bad things happen when they venture into the basement on a dare and read from an ancient tome. Now, if you're not in on the joke - that is, no one's spoiled it for you - you're probably nodding right now in recognition. This is what happens in these movies. This is not new. To add to that, your characters are straight out of central casting: a jock, a pretty girl, a wallflower, a stoner, and a smart dude. It seems too trite to be true, and it most certainly is.The movie intentionally deals in tropes from all kinds of scary movies. Zombies. Zombie families. Ghosts, blobs, redneck hillbillies with chainsaws. Cave-ins. By now, you're reading this and, still naive to the actual plot, are starting to catch on. You see, this is what the Scream movies should have been. You remember those, right? They loudly and proudly proclaimed they were 'in on the joke,' but with every known horror-movie rule they explained to a knowing audience, the characters in that movie broke another one. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.But not here, oh no. Our characters are never in control of anything. They aren't wiseasses; they're just caricatures, symbols of certain archetypes. They make their choices and deal with the consequences. If a game is being played, it's not rigged in their favor; it may not, in fact, be really rigged at all.It isn't long into the movie that we learn the cause of our heroes' distress. It would be unfair to detail it here, but let's just say that others can see every move they make and that there is apparently plenty more at stake than the lives of five measly young adults. In addition to the thrills that the movie offers, there's a great contrast between what the characters experience (as mere victims) and what goes on behind the curtain. When the audience realizes this, the movie...well, it's a whole new movie. Suddenly it's not about the fate of those five, it's about a heck of a lot more than that. Or less than that, if one doesn't buy the given premise at that turning point. There are few recognizable names in the cast. Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, and even Sigourney Weaver show up. They're not the focus here. What will be recognizable are the monsters, the breadth of which cannot be overstated. The action at its best is so frantic it might take a DVD pause to spot a particular baddie. There's mayhem, there's a lot of bloodletting, there's gore, and there's a visceral sense of satisfaction that cannot be simply slapped together by amateurs playing movie makers.For me, Cabin in the Woods was terrifying, and in the gleeful, do-it- again way. I don't think it means to be realistic, even in its created environment. It's scary in the jolts and the surprises and the smack- you-in-the-face action. Does it seem like I'm gushing too much? Not half as much as blood gushes in the movie. Okay, that was a cheap shot, but it was fun to type. This is an essential scary movie.",8,0,1,4 November 2012
Joy," Prime J-Law; shame the other characters are so awful
","Jennifer Lawrence plays Joy, a beleaguered housewife/TSA agent who invents a self-wringing mop and successfully promotes it on the newly hatched QVC network. This success is despite the relentless stress of having divorced/estranged parents, an ex-husband, two children, and her grandmother all living under her roof and each with his or her own selfish peculiarities. Well, maybe not kindly grandma, who narrates the story.See, first there's dad Rudy (Robert DeNiro), who's just been kicked out of his current wife's (or girlfriend's, not sure) house – 'I'm done with him – you can have him back' – and who owns and operates a repair shop that happens to have a gun range. Rudy's the sort of guy who rubs just about everyone the wrong way, but of course Joy puts up with his shenanigans. Then there's mom Terry (an unrecognizable Virginia Madsen), who spends almost all of her time in her room watching her stories and flushing her hair down the toilet, which inevitably clogs. There's passionate ex Tony (Edgar Ramirez), who has a good heart if a lack of direction and who lives in the basement. And there's grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd), who seems to be the only sensible, nurturing person in the house. There's also Joy's half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm), who doesn't live on the premises but may as well – and she herself has sort of a passive-aggressive love-hate relationship with the ironically named Joy.Aggravating family aside, Joy – a longtime lover of creating things – stumbles upon the need for the aforementioned mop. Up until then, mop heads were permanently attached to the mop handle and couldn't be cleaned without the user touching the nasty thing. Joy discovers that winding a single strand of wool hundreds of times around a base, the mop head not only becomes more absorbent it also becomes easily detached. One can put it in the washing machine! One won't need to buy a new mop every few months! This discovery leads to much success and with it the downsides of running a business – particularly when the business involves your quirky family as well as Dad's new girlfriend, Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), who invests heavily in Joy's venture. Lot of people to please. Lot of potential for things to go wrong, too, when one is a novice in the world of business.(I don't even want to get into Bradley Cooper's character, the head of programming at QVC. Cooper is a little too subtle in his role, almost the point of invisibility. Talk about underwhelming.) Okay, enough plot exposition. Lawrence is winning as always and, in fact, elevates her character with more sincerity and moxie than the script allows. But she's about the only actor who does a lot with flimsy material. DeNiro's character is overbearing and obnoxious; Rossellini's even more so. Joy's rotten half-sister comes off as devious, resentful, and despicable, but prior to Joy's success there was no hint of acrimony. I get it, she's jealous of the success, but there's nothing to back up the attitude. Those characters all feel like they should be in a much broader film, not a character study. In other words, the tone adopted by them is at odds with that adopted by Joy; the two types clash, rather than contrast.Joy is a sufficiently entertaining movie, and it's almost entirely due to Lawrence's strong performance. Director David O. Russell, who also co-wrote the script, has done better.",6,0,1,30 September 2017
Happy Feet," Feets don't fail me now!
","Happy Feet, directed by the man who gave us both Babe: Pig in the City and Mad Max, is just the kind of feel-good animated film that works on a few different levels; it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll inevitably, unquestionably, make you tap your toes or bounce your leg, right there in the theater. It's charming and exquisitely detailed, and it succeeds where it really counts: It makes you really feel for the lovable lead penguin, Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood).Mumble is an unfortunate penguin, you see, because was born with no singing ability, and in his penguin tribe one attracts a mate through the use of song. The poor flightless bird can only look on helplessly as his fellow hatchlings croon their little hearts out. Amazingly, though, Mumble can tap dance, a big no-no in the penguin community. Soon, with no heart song to guide him, Mumble isn't permitted to graduate from school, to the chagrin of his Elvis-like dad (Hugh Jackman) and his songbird-like mom (Nicole Kidman).Mumble heart belongs to the best singer in his age group, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), but without the gift of song he can't hope to woo her. Worse, with the penguins' food supply running out, some of the other birds begin to blame Mumble's foot-tapping, that somehow he is angering the great god Guin. The sad-sack penguin is then drummed out of the penguin corps, shunned for his lack of song and strength of feet, and he runs into another penguin colony, one that uses pebbles to woo their females instead of song, and makes new friends - a Latino-sounding quartet that's high on life, full of zest and pizazz and charisma, everything that Mumble's old group isn't.Then Mumble hears from some predator birds of mysterious 'aliens' who probe and attach tags to their victims. Mumble thinks these aliens might have something to do with the lack of fishies for everyone to munch on, so he and his new pals head off on a Quest to find these aliens and ask them to stop stealing all the fish.Some of the scenes are beautifully imagined, including attacks by sea lions (quite harrowing, actually, until its denouement), vultures, and killer whales, not to mention every time Mumble and/or his posse leap off a cliff and slide down the side like avian sleds. Or through ice tunnels. Or through the water itself, shooting like streaming jetliners with mile-long contrails. Gorgeous animation.At its heart, the movie is about how it's okay to Be Different. It's about how older folks sometimes hold prejudices that are as illogical as they are insulting, and how they'll often pass along those prejudices to their children, sometimes through direct actions and sometimes by dint of their inaction when wrongs are being perpetuated.Robin Williams takes on four roles in this movie: the Narrator (where he's excellent and not at all hammy), Ramon and Cletus (two of the feisty new penguins), and Lovelace, a self-professed penguin guru to whom penguins go to have their problems solved. On the one hand, Williams is delightful doing what he does best, improvising rapid-fire comic patter to get laughs; on the other hand, he's Robin Williams, and although there are differences between his voice characterizations, they all bear a strong resemblance to one another. As with most animated films, the movie is well-cast; Jackman is particular has an appealing Southern drawl (ironically, he and Kidman are Aussies playing penguins with southern accents).In the wake of the phenomenal, surprise success of March of the Penguins, Happy Feet makes your heart soar from start to finish. It'll be very difficult not to shed a tear at the mistreatment of Mumble by his peers and his elders, and it'll be near impossible to thoroughly enjoy this dazzling animated offering.",8,117,182,19 November 2006
Her," Her is flawed
","Her is one of those movies that I thought I would and could like, given its unorthodox plot, but I found it to be sad and dull and not so much invigorating as depressing and numbing. It does feature fine performances, but the promising premise quickly winds its way through predictable scenarios and foreseeable outcomes. Joaquin Phoenix, doing his best Jude Law impression, plays Theodore Twombley, a man who writes 'handwritten' letters for clients in what's probably the future. He gets the basic idea from the client and then goes to town, dictating his letter to his computer, which renders the letter in nice neat cursive for the recipient. The letters are sincere and heartfelt, and Theodore is very good at his job.When we first meet Theodore, he's a lonely, mopey guy, still recovering from a separation from his wife (Rooney Mara) a year prior, even though the divorce papers haven't yet been signed. His friends Amy (Amy Adams) and Charles worry about him; Theodore never really goes out. Then he sees an ad for a new operating system for the home, a system with not only a personality but also the ability to grow and learn. Since he's looking for some companionship anyway, he purchases the new system and installs it. The system has the voice of Scarlett Johansson and names herself Samantha. Soon, Samantha is best-friends-for-life with Theodore; she helps him to stay organized and focused, plays the role of supportive friend, offers advice and conversation, all things that Theo really needs. But, since she is an operating system designed to evolve, she begins to want more out of existence. She, like Data from Star Trek and countless other not-human characters, wants to know what it's like to be human, to have both a body and feelings.This may seem like an odd relationship (and it is), but it's more normal in this pseudo-future than it is in real life. People left and right have personalized operating systems. You think it's still strange to see someone talking to themselves? You check yourself and realize they're using Bluetooth for something, right? Now imagine most people doing that, only instead of an obvious Bluetooth headset there's only a tiny earpiece. It's a little counterintuitive, in a way: a movie that's all about getting a man to get out and enjoy life more does so by isolating him from the world, just him and his operating system (in portable, iPhone form). Come to think of it, I can't remember seeing Theodore talking on the phone with anyone other than Samantha.It isn't long before Theodore and Samantha realize they have very strong feelings for one another. Again, not really as weird as it would be today, as so many people apparently do date their operating systems in Theo's world. He's soon taking Samantha places, at her behest, and they live and love and play and laugh and so on, just as if it were a humans- only relationship. That they do hit some rough patches points again to Samantha's ability to grow - to become more human, really. But how human can she be? More human than human?This is the first movie that Spike Jonze has both written and directed. That fact may have no bearing on the pacing on the film, but I include it just in case. I thought that the movie moved excruciatingly slow, as it were filmed in a dreamy fog, or a foggy dream, or a nightclub. This is a character study, and a sci-fi one at that, so one would expect deliberate pacing. But in Her, I felt that the story moved even more slowly than that. The camera sometimes lingered for several seconds on a close-up shot of a character, usually Theodore. The setup for scenes (for example, Theo's blind date with Olivia Wilde) takes longer than the scenes themselves, which means a lot of exposition and a lot of talking. That's not a bad thing if your movie has some profound wisdom to share or if the methodical pacing is offset by actual movement and plot development, but neither one of those criteria apply here. We do get strong performances by Phoenix, Adams, and Johannson, but in the end it feels like nothing really happened. Sure, Theo has changed a little, but we're left in the dark as to how much and if his life has truly improved.",6,1,2,19 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Well worth the hype
","A young man sits in a chair under bright lights, his face a cypher. He is on the popular Indian game show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” and he’s just correctly answered a question worth ten million rupees. As the episode ends - a cliffhanger! - the young man is arrested and taken to police headquarters on charges of cheating in the game. How could a boy from the poorest area of the country do so well on this knowledge show? The tale unfolds under the withering questions by the police inspector. Jamal (Dev Patel) explains how he came to be able to answer the show’s questions by describing his life, from his impoverished beginnings in Mumbai to his involvement with a Fagin-like misanthrope to his stint as an illicit tour guide at the Taj Mahal. Through it all, Jamal’s relationships with the two closest people to him - his brother Salim and their new friend Latika - strongly inform his own decision-making abilities. Jamal’s love for Latika, who we shortly learn is the impetus behind Jamal’s appearing on the game show, and his envy (or fear) of Salim are the crucial cogs in Jamal’s frightening existence.Director Danny Boyle doesn’t just show us the life and times of a poor Indian boy; if anything, that might make the movie more of a maudlin rags-to-riches story. No, this is a romance story, full of passion and undying love. No matter how many times Latika is separated from Jamal - he always finds her again, his heart pounding whenever she is near. It is for her that Jamal is on this game show, and as we learn, he knows the answer to each question he’s been asked because he remembers a specific event in his life on the run that connects him to that question.Jamal’s journey from boyhood to early adulthood is fraught with danger; his mother his bludgeoned to death in front of him by an anti-Muslim mob, and the Fagin-like creep who takes the brothers in does horrible things to boys like them, especially if they can’t carry a tune (and thus make money). But no matter what happens or where he lands in life, his thoughts are first and foremost with the beautiful Latika. Jamal believes it is written that they will be reunited, and because he believes it so strongly, we believe it, too.Hardly a false note is rung in this spellbinding, electrifying movie. Everything feels authentic, not a show staged for the pursuit of Western dollars. (There cast is composed of mostly Indian actors, not ringer Americans with “Indian” accents.) Boyle’s commanding, sure hand tells the dual stories of Jamal’s upbringing and his time on the game show, bringing them both to the same - and powerfully emotional conclusion. Dry eyes are not likely in the final third of this movie.",9,0,3,14 December 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," Max rocks.
","The latest Mad Max is a frenzied, endless race of souped-up, well-armed vehicles across a whole lot of sand. The relentless pace makes for a wildly exciting film for which the plot is superfluous and generally unnecessary. There is much mayhem and madness. It is quite good.This is perhaps the best pure action movie you'll see this year; even The Avengers and Star Wars have a fully developed story to get in the way. This one is a shot of pure adrenaline that never lets up. Here, the titular antihero has been captured by one of those omnipresent roving biker gangs I expect we'll all see in the near future. Max is turned over to a slaver/warlord named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who controls water and food for everyone in his stronghold, called The Citadel, doling it out whenever he sees fit. He also uses women for their breast milk and maintains a concubine of several wives, so you know he's not a good guy.Working for Joe - or, rather, idolizing him to the point where they believe he and only he can lead them into the afterlife world of Valhalla - are the War Boys, pale zealots who pilot terrifying vehicles of mass destruction and gain their strength and energy by usurping blood from generous donors - like Max. The War Boys love Max.Anyhow, every so often ol' Joe has to send out an Imperator for supplies; the Imperator drives a huge rig called a War Rig that's exceedingly well armed and customized to the driver's tastes. The driver in this case is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who has another plan in mind - rescue dear Joe's wives and take them to her own birthplace, the Green Place. Joe quickly gets wind of this and sends out a flurry of War Boys. One of the Boys, named Nux, is weak and in need of blood, so he straps the newly captured Max - a universal donor - to a pole on the front of his machine, and the race is on. Mission for the bad guys - stop Furiosa. Mission for the good guys - get to the Green Place by any means necessary.Really, the entire movie is a chase across a barren wasteland. It is a post-apocalyptic world, after all. There's leaping from car to car to truck! Oh, and the War Boys? They attach these long, bendy poles on the hoods of their vehicles with one of their own at the top. Then they can bend to and fro and either jump on the War Rig or maybe sneak in through the sun roof, steal a wife or two, and bounce back. Sheer genius! There's an enormous, blinding lightning sandstorm that accounts for much of the CGI in the film, but for the most part the effects are anything but computer generated. Loved the visual look of the movie, too, with washed-out landscapes and colorful foregrounds. Director George Miller's vision shows a world that appears dead on the outside but with glimmers of that most valuable of commodities - hope. And all of the little details, such as the vehicles themselves (some hybrids of 1950s cars, including an original Beetle) and Furiosa's guns and prosthetic arm, add the right touch. And how's his for strange - 3D is put to good use here, with junk (and people) flying off of cars and right between your eyeballs! For much of the first third of the movie, Max wears a face guard that sort of looks like an upside down pitchfork. One would assume Hardy is used to such gear at this point, having been through The Dark Knight Rises as Bane. Here, he's even tougher than Bane, even after he's had blood sapped from him like syrup from a maple tree. Max's name, incidentally, is mentioned only three times in the movie. Which is fine, of course - after all, we the audience know damn well who he is, and the lack of a name for his traveling companions lends itself quite nicely to his anonymity. He's like an even more badass Man with No Name. But he does have compassion, mainly because what haunts poor Max's every waking moment is the feeling that he let innocent people die (see previous three films in the series). Will that happen on Fury Road? Not on his watch! (Possibly.) Hardy is the figurative bomb as Max, a towering dynamo of nonstop energy. Theron gets 'ugly' again (note: she is not ugly, even here) with a shaved head, big muscles, and an attitude that would make Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor weep with respect. She should definitely make more action movies, provided they're more like this and not like Aeon Flux. It's always great to see a strong female protagonist, and here we have several; in addition to Furiosa, Immortan Joe's wives aren't wilting flowers but rather ass kickers who can load and fire guns. Pretty refreshing to see that, you know? This latest Mad Max - and will it be the last? - had me on the edge of my seat, which meant that I had to hold on lest I was blown away. But indeed, I was metaphorically blown away anyway, with a much-welcome return to visceral violent cinema in one of the year's top films.",8,4,11,17 May 2015
Gladiator," Sandals in the wind
","Ridley Scott attempted to do to sword-and-sandal pictures with this movie what James Cameron did for highfalutin disaster pics with Titanic. In other words, a bombastic, explicit, harrowing, no-holds-barred epic. And succeed the action auteur has.Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a loyal general in the Roman army. The Romans have conquered most of the civilized world, and there is only one outpost remaining. The stolid Maximus and his troops overtake the enemy, earning the grace of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). The dying Emperor calls his general to his bedside and tells him that when he's shuffled off this mortal coil, he wants Maximus to be the 'defender of Rome' and the leadership of the empire to go not to his son but back to the long-abandoned Roman Senate. It's quite a radical plan for the Emperor to have, and Maximus, against his own wishes, consents. When the aged Aurelius dies, however, the plan changes. The  Emperor's snotty, belligerent son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) assumes command (which is easy, since he's the son and no one else knew of the Emperor's plans) and orders the execution of Maximus. The stunned general is led off, but naturally defeats his captors. He becomes a slave and is eventually sold to Proximus (Oliver Reed, in his final movie) and is forced to fight as a gladiator in arenas for the amusement of the aristocrats (severe shades of Spartacus!). And, of course, he must somehow win his freedom, get the girl (who happens to be Commodus' sister), and avenge the murders of his wife and son, which happened when he was to be executed.Crowe grips his sword with an unyielding passion, gladly taking up the mantle passed to him by such golden-boy icons as Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. He's been touted as the Next Big Thing for a while now, but he seems like he'll be sticking around. Check him out in L.A. Confidential - or if you're in the mood for mediocre fluff, try Virtuosity with Denzel Washington. But Gladiator is the absolute pinnacle of Crowe's relatively brief career. The Aussie magnificently holds his own as an action star and still finds time to emote properly. (Ah, I'm such a sucker for a good emote!) Those of you who want to see him shirtless, you're in luck - however, in some of the scenes he's buried in some seriously huge and obtrusive armor.Crowe's Maximus is completely loyal to the empire, and it blows his mind that he could go from being so highly respected in the land to being a slave. But this is not a morality tale of how a well-off man must suffer so that he may know the less-fortunate; in fact, there's not much moralizing here (aside from the usual vengeance-shall-be-mine theme). Once he's escaped his executioners, Maximus adopts an attitude of grim determination. He's relentless in his goal - he MUST save Rome. This kind of character development we don't get to see much in action movies, and while the movie is exceptionally well written for such a genre film, it's really Crowe's show. A lesser actor might have grunted and grimaced his way through much of the dialogue, but Crowe was more than up to the task. This was a blockbuster at the box office, and with great reason. This might even be one for the ages. My policy is to never overpraise a film as a 'classic' (or, worse yet, 'instant classic,' as if you only needed to add water), so I'll restrain myself here. The best way to find out if a movie is a classic is to wait 20 years. This way you get a more subjective historical perspective on the film - who's to say that in 20 years we'll think of this film as a nostalgia piece of the early 2000's?",9,0,0,5 December 2000
Donnie Darko," Dopey.
","Lot of buzz about this one; people either seemed to think it was the coolest thing around or an example of overcleverness.There's a fine line between clever and stupid, as the saying goes, and Donnie Darko doesn't cross that line - it stays firmly on the side of stupid. Oh, it <i>thinks</i> it's clever, but it outsmarts itself, dissolving instead into a puddle of drivel.Basic story is that Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high schooler with some awesomely awful visions; he keeps seeing an evil mutant bunny rabbit who tells him to commit acts of violence and that the world's ending in 28 days. You know, your garden variety doom-and-gloom stuff. Donnie doesn't know how to deal with these horrendous visions, so his family sends him to a psychiatrist.in a very early scene, one of Donnie's acting-out episodes (or is it sleepwalking) finds him outside the house in the middle of the night. Suddenly, a plane engine crashes into his house, landing in his bedroom. No one's hurt, but it's the first of several weird tragedies to befall him and his family. Donnie thinks it's a sign.Maggie Gyllenhaal (who, as you might surmise from her name, is Jake's sister in real life) plays his older sister here, and she's fantastic in the few scenes she's in. Mary McDonnell plays their mom. Some guy and some girl play the father and the younger sister, respectively; neither made an impression on me. Jena Malone plays Donnie's new girlfriend. Drew Barrymore has a thankfully small role as a teacher. Even Patrick Swayze shows up.Time travel, philosophy, nihilism, evil clowns, evil bunny rabbits, and funky coincidences all play roles. Absurdity upon absurdity is heaped onto the steaming pile of plot with the apparent intent to confuse and obfuscate. Weirdness does not cleverness equal, sadly. J. Gyllenhaal is miscast; he looks too pure and innocent.",2,6,10,17 September 2004
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An unflattering, debasing humiliation
","Good things don't always come in threes. Or twos. For that matter, the first one could be pretty rancid, too. But the intended audience for the Transformers movies don't care; no matter how wretched and incomprehensible these movies are, they make money. Probably partly because they're now being released in 3D, tickets to which are more costly, but I digress.Some people like to watch things blow up and require little else in a movie. We refer to these people as Michael Bay fans. Bay here continues his long-standing tradition of churning out a pile of exploding crap - but with robots! They make all the difference. Imagine a movie in which every scene was essentially a 'we're running out of time' scenario, with every other minute filled with something either getting hit or hitting something else, and you have a Michael Bay movie. This is not news.I can't blame Bay for making the movie or for actors like Shia Labeouf and John Turturro and Josh Duhamel appearing in them. The movies are mints, both domestically and internationally. Explosions are the true worldly language. And I can't blame those who want only this kind of movie to exist; after all, in theory their patronage allows smaller films to exist. But all of that aside, this is a trainwreck of a movie. It has a laughable plot, hysterically bad acting, and unfathomable fight scenes and seems to have been filmed by a pixie in the middle of a glue-sniffing marathon. It's inept and probably shouldn't be watched unless one is actually under the influence. Or paid.Anyway, it seems something's been dormant on the moon lo these many years - hence why no one's conveniently been back since '72 - and it has something to do with our new friends, the Autobots. Megatron, evil bad guy supreme, is back; Optimus Prime, super good guy revives an older prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) inside the ship found on the moon, but before you know it the Autobots are fighting Megatron's Decepticons in an effort not to take over the world. Some robots return from the first and/or second movies. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Labeouf), the luckless loser of the first two films who somehow manages to get the girl and his own pet robot/car, is also back - with a new girl, played by the very British newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and is now looking for a job. He's constantly whining about it, too. Oh, and his new girl - whom he met while getting a medal from President Obama, no less - has a kick-ass job doing something or other with a suspicious-looking Patrick Dempsey.In short - robots attack, other robots fight back, good robot-on-robot action, boy saves world again, gets girl, and roll credits.What's there to like about this one? Well, Huntington-Whiteley is not terrible. She may even be better than the deposed Megan Fox. But she doesn't screw up, and that's good. She looks pretty, and the camera notices. Hm, other than that, there's some interesting fight scenes. But let me tell you about those fight scenes.When you have two robots fighting each other, particularly amid an urban landscape, you should make sure they are discernible from each other. I know, sounds elementary and obvious, but not to Michael Bay. There are plenty of fight scenes in which each or all robot participants are gray/beige. Optimus Prime is easy to pick out - he's blue and red. Bumblebee is yellow. Most, if not all, of the Decepticons are gray and black. Even some of the Autobots are gray and black. Then the action is so whiplash inducing that it's tough to understand who's actually winning a battle.This kind of movie requires that one suspend disbelief. This movie in particular, however, requires that you expel disbelief from your mind for an extended, indefinite leave. First, there's the robots. They're sentient and have weaponry. And yet somehow they're not bulletproof. Now, I'm not bulletproof, although I can strap on a vest that will make me so, to a degree, but the reason we humans don't wear them is that a) we're not always in peril and b) the vests are pretty heavy and not at all slimming. Why aren't these robots impervious to Earth bullets? Then there's Sam Witless. Fresh out of college, he expects - because he saved the world twice! - to land a Top Job. He's an idiot. There's literally no reason for him to be hanging around at all in this movie, because he shouldn't possess the skills to fight alongside the Autobots. He's small, he's dumb, he's weak - or so he seems. Yeah, in the fight scenes he's suddenly Superman. He runs like a stuntman. (For that matter, so does Huntington-Whiteley.) How did he come to have such power and strength? How come he's given - more than once - firearms? Has he training in operating these weapons? I am thinking no. He's like a little kid who thinks he's Indiana Jones and John McClane rolled into one. Just awful.To top it all off, we also get the return of Sam's parents, who apparently are RVing around the world and visit Sam a week earlier than he'd thought - oh, sitcom time! As before, his mom's incredibly dumb but well meaning and his dad's a sullen jerk who obviously turns good at the end. (For half the movie he brings up how his son doesn't have a job yet.) I hope none of you saw this in the theater. If you did, I hope you didn't pay extra to see it in 3D. Why bother? This movie's an embarrassment. Amazingly, Frances McDormand is in this movie. She has a rather large role. She should burn all copies of this movie and pretend it never happened. She should return to, you know, good movies. I felt so bad for her here.",2,2,6,21 March 2012
The Social Network," Over-hyped
","he Social Network, about the intrigue surrounding the founding of the fantastically popular website Facebook (perhaps you've heard of it), is a fine film – but not a great one. That's a little disappointing, considering that David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac, Fight Club) is the director, but the movie isn't much more than a run-of-the-mill history movie about a subject matter – websites – that's not particularly compelling.In 2003, Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, Zombieland) creates a quickie site called Facemash, which takes head shots of female coeds and puts them side by side, allowing male users to rate which one is more attractive. This crashes the Harvard network and brings him to the attention of one of the many posh elite clubs on campus, whose leaders (the Winklevoss twins) ask Mark to create a social networking site for them, but open only to Harvard students.This in turn leads Mark to create Facebook itself, rather than the Harvard-oriented site. It also sets off a chain of events that would eventually make Mark a billionaire, albeit one sued by not only the twins but by his own best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), the company's CFO.The movie's how-it-all-came-together theme is interspersed with legal proceedings – both sets – that put everything into a sort of current context. What caused Eduardo and Mark to be at odds? Do the twins have a chance of defeating Mark? And how does Sean Parker of Napster (Justin Timberlake) fit into all of this?More than 500 million people use Facebook presently. It's no longer a haven limited to college students. My mom's on it. If my grandparents were alive, they'd be on it as well. It's a hugely successful tool in so many ways – small businesses can use it to keep in touch with their customers, friends can find their friends anywhere in the world, people can catch up with old classmates, and so on. It's highly intuitive and very user friendly, and it's all free.Making a movie about a website can't be easy. A website isn't three dimensional; it's not exhilarating to watch someone create one. The Social Network is simply not an exciting movie, although it tries really hard to be one. It attempts to show that the intrigue and back stabbing that occurred behind the scenes of its rapid rise into the zeitgeist is riveting, fascinating stuff. But when the movie was over, I didn't know much more about Mark Zuckerberg than I did going in to the theater, and what I learned about Facebook itself was just trivia.On top of that, the legal stuff that's always in the background is just dull, no matter how many snide answers Zuckerberg gives to opposing counsel. We're not talking about the Scopes monkey trial here.On the plus side, we do get a terrific performance from Eisenberg, who shows he's not just another schlubby always-a-victim actor; the role has some real heft to it, and he's amazingly up to the challenge, particularly with the rapid patter that always seems to be coming from Zuckerberg's mouth.Other than that, though, this is almost a generic origin story about a subject that's really not interesting enough to warrant a full-length movie.",6,5,9,9 October 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," Sad, in the unfortunate, crappy way
","There are undoubtedly two camps of people who watched this film: those who start to tear up at the very hint of a Very Special Movie, and those who rely a little on logic and, I dunno, sense; those who, that is, want the movie to work a little to earn tears, not the other way around.Guess which group I'm in.Chis Gardner (Will Smith) is a salesman of sorts - he sells scanners to medical professionals that are supposed to be more detailed than x-ray machines, and much more expensive. He bought a whole bunch of them years ago and has been selling them to doctors and hospitals ever since, only sales have stagnated somewhat, and he's struggling big time. Now, me, in this situation, might, perhaps, get another job, one that paid something, anything to keep food on the table for my wife (Thandie Newton) and son (Jaden Smith).But Chris isn't like me. Instead, after bumping into a rich-looking white dude, he decides he wants to be a stockbroker and applies (after many contrivances) for an internship at Dean Witter. Only, oops! It's not a paying internship! But Chris doesn't know that, and neither does wife Linda, who works double shifts at a hospital. Are you seeing the picture here? The mother works her hands to the bone, the dad is a shiftless loser who can't sell crappy scanners that no one needs, and what's the wise papa do? Why, chases a dream. Because if there's any time that's just made for chasing dreams, it's when you have a wife and kids and are a couple months behind in your rent and haven't paid your taxes yet for the year.Naturally, after Chris makes this decision and when the scanner sales slow down even more, Linda has enough and bolts for some nebulous waitressing job on the other side of the country. Up until this point, she was easily the stronger, more viable, and more responsible of the parents. But then we wouldn't get this touching plot of a father bonding with his son, so out goes Linda. (Yes, I know this is based on a true story, but I imagine some of these plot devices are fictions from the screenwriter.) Speaking of plot devices, as Chris blows off landlord after landlord, he and young Christopher are kicked out of their home, and then a motel, and they sleep on buses, in bathrooms, anywhere. This is supposed to show how Chris will suffer for his son, that he loves him so much and is trying so hard to make his life better. The trouble is, nearly all of Chris's problems were caused by... you guessed it, Chris himself. We can all relate, I'm sure, to The Man keeping us down; we struggle and make a little progress, only to be pushed back down by creditors, Johnny Law, our bosses, and so on. Sometimes fate does conspire against us. But it didn't feel like that was wholly the case here. Chris is outraged to get a notice from the IRS placing a lien on his bank account. Why is he outraged? Linda even reminded him to take care of the taxes, and Chris actively said he'd just keep filing extensions. This is no one's fault but Chris Gardner's.The trouble is, you really want to feel for Chris. He knows that if he works hard and is fortunate, he can emerge from the unpaid internship with a paid job as a broker at Dean Witter. A great goal to have, of course. It just seems strange that he felt that the most viable option to him was to work as a stockbroker. He couldn't take a menial job or two to scrape up enough money to pay taxes or, heck, rent a room? God forbid. In a telling scene, Chris explodes outside a mission that had just announced it had no more room. I'm paraphrasing, but as Chris argued with a man who'd cut in front of him in line (thus denying him entrance to the mission), he mentions that he had to run from his job to get to the line in time. Whoa, wait, hold up a sec there, Chris. You're in a line of homeless people. You might not wanna mention that you have a JOB. Most of the rest of these folks, you see, don't have a job. That is why they are homeless. You came off as a major jerk. Again, not someone worthy of our pity.So who is? Christopher, the young'un, surely is. What's he done to deserve this crappy parenting? His mom basically abandons him with no fight at all, and his dad chooses a tenuous unpaid job over a paycheck. Jaden Smith was critically lauded for his wonderful work here, and he was much more deserving of an Oscar nomination than his old man, who seemed to be praised merely for not playing Will Smith. At least we didn't get yet another rendition of Smith's 'Oh, HELL no!' exclamations. But the kid was very good, and adorable to boot.The rest of the cast isn't on screen enough to make much of an impression; they're all just window dressing to the relationship between father and son. James Karen is unintentionally amusing as the Great White Father to Smith's broker, needlessly upping the smarm factor. Because, you know, brokerage firms never seem to have enough smarm.All in all, a disappointment unless you just treat it as a low-grade TV movie about someone persevering against long odds, cheerfully ignoring the fact that those odd were made long by that same person. Bear in mind, though, that the movie is merely based on a true story, that many liberties were taken to accentuate the supposed struggles of Chris and Christopher.",4,31,55,22 May 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Still-Bourne
","Matt Damon reprises his role as former-agent-now-with-amnesia Jason Bourne, who finds himself being shot at while in India with his lovely wife, Maria (Franka Potente). Who's trying to kill Jason? Another former agent? The mob? The U.S. government? Bourne wants answers, and the improbable path seems to lead to the CIA and a now-dormant super-duper-secret organization.The CIA wants to kill Bourne, because they believe he killed two of their agents. Bourne, as in the first film, still needs to know who he is, who's trying to kill him, and the relevance of the name Treadstone.Fans of the first movie will likely enjoy this second film, but fans of the second book (by Robert Ludlum, don't ya know) will be mystified, since the movie takes only a few basic elements from the book. Which is a shame, in my estimation, because the second book was pretty well packed with action and intrigue. The movie makes up for this by including a quite lengthy car chase during the final third of the film.Perhaps a different director (Paul Greengrass instead of Doug Liman, who executive produced) explains the change in pacing and tone; Bourne seems the same, which is good, but less seems explained, which is bad. Also, the action scenes are so fast cutting that it's sometimes impossible to tell what's going on.Damon still looks the part, and he does a very good job in the role. We don't see enough of Franka Potente, unfortunately, but we do get to see the great Joan Allen as the CIA official out to get Bourne. The ending's a bit too pat, rendering a lot of the plot meaningless. All in all, it's a good time waster, just not as engrossing as the original",6,0,2,27 December 2004
Shark Tale," Chom chomp deelicious
","Oscar (Will Smith) is a young bottom-feeding fish who wants to make it to the top - the top of the reef, that is - but is stuck with his dead-end job on the assembly line at a whale wash. His best friend is Angie (Rene Zellweger), an angel fish with the typical heart o' gold. Angie loves Oscar to death, but he's too dopey and blind to figure that out.But Oscar's the fishie on the spot when he's witness to a descending anchor that kills a shark that was chasing him. Aha, problem solved! You bet it is, especially when Oscar sort of takes credit for the death, proclaiming himself 'Sharkslayer.' Top of the world, ma! Will Oscar finally realize that Angie is his One True Love, or will he fall to the considerable and formidable charms of the lovely and mysterious Lola (Angelina Jolie)? And will he figure out his romance situation before he's iced by the local Mob boss Don Lino (Robert DeNiro), who happens to be the father of the shark who was killed by the anchor, the shark everyone thinks Oscar killed? Charming, whimsical, and fulla heart and moxie, Shark Tale tries - and succeeds - to do for fishfolk what Antz did for insectfolk. Both, incidentally, were Dreamworks creations, and it's somewhat assuring to see a company other than Disney consistently turn out fun, high-quality animation.For once, Smith is perfectly cast. Don't get me wrong, I've liked quite a few Will Smith films, but most of the time he's an entertainer and showman, not an actor. There's plenty of showmanship in his performance here, but for some reason the animation comes across as completely sincere. So it's the Will Smith show again, but against the animated backdrop of the briny deep, it somehow works wonderfully.Bearing in mind that during the making of animated films, the actors providing the voices often do not work simultaneously (although they did do so a few times for Shark Tale), I thought the vocal chemistry between De Niro and Smith was excellent. Strong performances abounded, from a fairly disparate selection of actors: De Niro, Smith, Zellweger, Jolie, Peter Falk, Jack Black, Ziggy Marley, and Doug E. Doug.So all in all, a whole lotta fun. You might say the movie has teeth, but you'd be wrong - it's an innocuous PG-rated movie, so rated merely for its mild cartoon violence. Your kidlets will probably love it - or at least they will if there's a Happy Meal involved, which I'm sure there was.",7,1,2,8 April 2005
Hustle & Flow," Powerful stuff
","Terrence Howard plays a Memphis pimp who decides to give hardcore rapping a shot in this arresting, gritty drama. Howard plays DJay, who pimps girls out of his beat-up Chevy Nova. When he comes into the possession of an electronic keyboard, DJay plays around with it and finds he has a talent for writing and performing hard, violent lyrics.On its face, this seems like a typical 'man rises from the ashes of his hardscrabble life to experience success and then watches it all crash down around him' kind of movie. It's not a movie about suffering, success, and redemption, in other words. But it's not as predictable as it may seem at first blush, and Howard is not your typical actor, by any shot.DJay lives with his small stable of prostitutes in a tumble-down shack in the Memphis ghetto. As pimps go, he's not exactly Donald Trump. Some dance for an exotic club during the day and hook at night; some hook all day. But the money's not rolling in for DJay, who remains somewhat confident that he'll someday come out ahead. When he obtains the keyboard, inspiration strikes, and a chance encounter with an old classmate (Anthony Anderson) who's now a producer (of sorts) gives DJay the opportunity to jump out of the rotten life he's carved for himself.This never feels like a typical rise-and-fall story, and that's thanks in no small part to the powerful performance by Howard, who's much better here than in the critically lauded (by some) Crash. Appearing with Howard in Crash was Ludicrous, who also has a big role in Hustle and Flow - hey, some rappers are very good actors, it turns out. Howard, aided by a crisp script from Craig Brewer, who also directed, never portrays DJay as simply a nice guy with some flaws, someone who's been handed a bad hand and is making the best of it. It's clear that DJay's made all of his own choices, and the situation he finds himself in - depending on hookers for his livelihood - is of his own doing.But neither does the script show DJay as being entirely bad, either, as evidenced by some surprisingly tender, moving scenes between DJay and Key (Anderson) and DJay and Shug, his pregnant woman. These scenes don't come off as stilted or insincere, and that's thanks especially to Howard's strong performance. True, too, are the scenes in which DJay lays down a rap track in his home; you can feel the rage seeping through your television.This movie might be a difficult sell to those who have trouble relating to the environment and atmosphere in which DJay operates. Undoubtedly those who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks will recognize aspects of their own lives, identifying strongly with one or more of the characters. But even those of us who have never lived in squalor, who've generally had advantages that others do not, can appreciate the intense, gray world in which DJay and his associates live. Had this been a simple, typical biography of a musician from the mean streets, it wouldn't have had near the effectiveness, the passion of Hustle and Flow. The movie intrigues you, makes you want to know what happens to DJay, even when it's obvious he's a bit of a jerk. But because he's not a stupid man, his actions cannot be painted as simply good or simply bad. Howard, in particular, is well deserving of his critical accolades here.",8,29,36,13 February 2006
Princess Mononoke," Princess Mononoke – it's not a name, it's a description
","Hayao Miyazaki, the animation legend who brought to you such awesome films as Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, strikes again with this eco-friendly tale about the struggle between man, animal, and god within a deep, dark Japanese forest.Prince Ashitaka (voice of Billy Crudup) of the Emishi, stricken with a curse foisted upon him by a rampaging wild boar that was possessed by a demon, heads west upon his trusty golden elk Yakul to find a cure. He's also out to possibly save his people, as the appearance of the demonic boar portends grave consequences for the village – the gods and demons are reclaiming the forest.Ashitaka attempts to buy some food in a neighboring town with a gold nugget, but the shopkeepers do not quite believe that the nugget is a valid form of currency. Our fair prince is saved from further embarrassment by a monk named Jigo (Billy Bob Thornton), who offers his assistance to Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns from Jigo of a town called (in the English version, anyway) Iron Town, since they mine iron. Jigo also mentions that the forest gods still dwell around Iron Town, a fact that is certainly not lost on Ashitaka. He heads out the next morning.Meanwhile, a long column of men and oxen, carrying rice back to Iron Town to feed the denizens, is attacked by two giant wolves – one of whom bears a masked girl. Leading the men is Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), who orders her men to fire their brand-new muskets at the wolves. The wolves are driven off, but their mama, named Moro (Gillian Anderson) soon arrives and lays everyone to waste. Half of Lady Eboshi's men fall off the mountainside.Further down the mountain, Ashitaka hears the battle above and comes across two men in the river. He pulls them out (one unconscious, the other with a broken arm) and carries them both through the ancient forest to Iron Town. On the way to Iron Town, Ashitaka encounters the wolves and the girl by the river side. The girl is San, the Princess Mononoke, i.e., the Angry Princess. Why is she so angry? Because Lady Eboshi has been killing all of the animals, which has been causing the forest to fall into disrepair and has angered the forest gods. She kind of has good reason to be mad.The reception at Iron Town is mixed, as many distrust the newcomer Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns that everyone in the village helps mine the iron, with the women operating the mighty bellows themselves. Lady Eboshi also explains that San really has it in for her (because of the forest damage Eboshi's caused) and that when the Forest Spirit himself is dead, San will become human (although to the viewer she looks perfectly human as it is). San, raised by wolves, is not on board with this eventuality.All of which leads to everyone fighting everyone, with mass destruction guaranteed. Iron Town is under siege by Lord Asano and his samurai, who wish to control the iron ore. The Iron Town citizens are left to defend themselves against Asano while Eboshi and Jigo the monk seek out the Forest Spirit; Jigo has a letter from the Emperor himself that guarantees a large sum of money if Jigo can bring the Forest Spirit's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality). Then there are an entire tribe of huge wild boars who want to avenge the death of one of their own – the boar that wound up cursing Ashitaka to kick all of this off – as well taken on the humans for being humans. Oh, and apes who also want to kill the humans, particularly Ashitaka, whom they want to eat so they can gain his strength.There's plenty of action, in other words. In fact, the violence is a bit more explicit than you might expect in an animated film. When Ashitaka is first dealing with his curse, he fires an arrow at a soldier who is attacking him; the arrow cuts the man's arm clean off. Ashitaka doesn't know his own strength, it would seem. There's also a fair amount of blood, and a couple of particularly icky scenes: one in which San removes a bullet from Moro by sucking out the blood and spitting it out and another in which San helps Ashitaka eat by first chewing beef jerky and then passing it to him by mouth (he's very weak, you see). I understand, but eww.Princess Mononoke has plenty of strong-willed characters, and many of them are female: San, Lady Eboshi, and Moro, plus Ashitaka and Jigo. The Forest Spirit is a wonder to behold, too, appearing to be part human, part ape, part deer, and probably parts of lots of other animals as well. And the visuals are about what I expected from the maestro Miyazaki, although I think they weren't quite as well developed as they were in some of his other works, like the earlier Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And it's also possible that there are just too many characters and plot lines and conflicts in Princess Mononoke to easily track. But overall, this is an unquestionable triumph of animation.",8,1,2,13 July 2016
Cinderella Man," Simply beautiful
","In 1928, James. J. Braddock was a champion light-heavyweight prizefighter. By 1933, though, he'd hit some pretty hard times, along with most of the rest of America. With a broken right hand and a doused spirit, Braddock was so pathetic in the ring that his license to fight was revoked. Unable to pay the bills, Braddock's family has to sell off nearly everything it owns to survive. Braddock can't even get steady work at the docks, as there are precious few jobs each day. In celebration of the indomitable American spirit, Braddock rises from his squalor ashes to challenge the legendary - and murderous - Max Baer for the heavyweight championship at Madison Square Garden.Braddock (Russell Crowe) isn't fighting for himself; he's fighting for his wife Mae (Rene Zellweger) and their three kids and the entirety of the impoverished populace of America, people utterly destroyed and broken by the Great Depression. Crowe's Braddock is resilient and courageous, undergoing tremendous suffering to keep his family honorably fed. Crowe himself is amazing, grim-faced, intrepid, humble, and noble. He doesn't see boxing as his right, but as a distinct privilege. Crowe's performance is gutsy, physically demanding, and so evocative that the viewer can feel the punches he's taking - and dishing out.Standing behind Braddock and his career choice is his long-suffering wife Mae, although it takes her some time to fully comprehend what Braddock's struggles really mean. Zellweger portrays Mae as no wilting flower, able to love her husband for his boxing and in spite of it. Braddock's other main source of inspiration comes in the person of his trainer/manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti, who was nominated for an Oscar - finally). Gould cares very deeply about the welfare of his fighter, almost to the exclusion of everything else. He proves himself to be a true friend to Braddock, remaining with him through even the toughest times. Giamatti delivers a powerhouse performance as the cagey ringhand; it's hard to imagine a runty looking guy like Giamatti could play such a tough-as-nails character, but he pulls it off, seemingly effortlessly.Although this is a sports biopic, the movie never veers to the maudlin, never choosing melodrama over sincerity. Moving, compassionate, and beautiful, Cinderella Man is the kind of movie that makes even the manliest men weep openly and certainly leaves an indelible mark on your heart. The violence is brutal - particularly the final fight against Baer - but never gratuitously so, showing that the steady hand of director Ron Howard once again has produced a honest winner. The entire cast is magnificent (and look for Howard's brother Clint in a small role).",9,1,2,2 February 2006
Valkyrie," Flawed by Cruise performance, but not a terrible thriller
","Tom Cruise's traditional one-note performance prevents this true-life suspense thriller from being anything but a predictable, pointless exercise in hubris. Although most of the accents seem inauthentic anyway, Cruise's dull, toneless American dialect is about as sincere as Kevin Costner's legendary Robin Hood accent, without the sweeping sense of purpose. In the end, the movie is largely forgettable; given the large amount of negative publicity surrounding it and its star, this is faint praise indeed.Colonel von Stauffenberg (Cruise) is a disillusioned German officer during World War II who decides that he and he alone must thwart the Fuhrer and save Germany from itself. He quickly discovers, though, that he's not exactly alone in that attitude, as various fellow officers (played by such luminaries as Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, and Terence Stamp) have been trying to take Hitler out for some time. All they need is a good plan and a good organizer.The trouble, Stauffenberg quickly realizes, isn't the assassination itself but rather the aftermath. You can't just kill Hitler and waltz in with a new chancellor, since he does have plenty of supporters. So Staffenberg decides to co-opt an existing plan, called Valkryie, and adopt it for his own purposes. Valkyrie is intended to be the contingency plan should the Allies break through to Berlin, but Stauffenberg (rather easily) rewrites it so that one set of Germans is blamed for the assassination of Der Fuhrer, thus allowing them to be imprisoned by another set of Germans. Quite crafty.But as any casual student of world affairs in the twentieth century can attest, this isn't how thins panned out. As we all know, Hitler eventually committed suicide in his bunker in 1945, as the war was nearing its conclusion. So obviously the Stauffenberg plan was an abject failure, which sort of removes a lot of suspense. But director Bryan Singer still manages to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, particularly during the explosion that ostensibly kills Hitler (and his cabinet); you know it's coming, but it arrives so suddenly and so organically, without any good-guy slow-motion theatrics, that it's very jarring and effective.In addition, Singer pays less attention to What This All Means to the world (and Germany in particular) and concentrates instead on the psychological makeup of the conspirators, particularly the reticent General Olbricht (Nighy) and the decisive Stauffenberg. What happens to influence their plan? What happens that they hadn't counted on at all? Most importantly, what happens when the plan ultimately fails? So I have to give Singer a lot of credit here, building up some suspense when the outcome is already knowable to everyone.But the overall probably, as usual, is Cruise himself: he's simply not credible in the role of a long-serving German military officer. Cruise always seems to feel that since he's such a Great Actor, he can simply slap on some accessory - in this case, an eyepatch - and he's immediately transformed into that character. Not the same guy, Stauffenberg and Cruise! Not the same guy at all! The fact is, though, that the eyepatch has more personality; Cruise is neither serious enough nor solid enough in the role for you to believe he's anything other than Tom Cruise, Movie Guy. He even rolls through his standard two or three expressions, and when that's done, he's done.Cast with another Stauffenberg, Valkryie might have soared a bit higher, but Cruise's flawed performance is more reminiscent of an albatross than an eagle.",6,3,9,31 December 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Simpsons movie slouches and delivers
","When a TV show finally hits the big screen, what should the movie have that the show didn't? Obviously, stuff you can't get past the censors on television; jokes that are even more adult in nature, drug use, nudity, even some profanity - as long as the basic characterizations and tone of your program aren't mucked with. Right? I mean, what's the point, otherwise? And that's exactly what the cleverly titled The Simpsons Movie manages to do, shoehorning pithy comments and witty repartee into a relatively brief (87 minutes) cinematic explosion, a supernova of one of comedy's brightest stars.Now, often full-length feature versions of a TV show will simply be a long episode, or a couple of episodes strung together semicohesively. And semicoherently. But Matt Groening and James L. Brooks takes a plausible-for-the-Simpsons storyline and ratchets up... well, everything. There's more visual and verbal humor, more characters (though not new ones, really), more exciting locales - not just Springfield - and tons of in-jokes, most of which the intended audience is going to fawn over like Bambi's momma. (Speaking of which, there's an amusing scene in which Adorable Woodland Creatures help get Homer and Marge ready for their coital bed.) The basic plot line is that after a lot of nagging by one Lisa Simpson, the horribly polluted Lake Springfield - where people dump crap, dead bodies, and toxic waste - has finally been cleaned up. Mayor Quimby is especially proud of their new deterrent system to prevent people from dumping - it's a wall. But wouldn't you know it, it's only so idiotproof, and Homer winds up throwing an entire silo of pig poop (don't ask) into the lake, immediately killing it and causing some mutant creatures to develop. The EPA, noting this, decides that the entire area must be sealed off, so they put a huge glass dome around Springfield. No one can get in, and most importantly no one - especially toxic waste - can get out. No wonder that in short time the rest of the Springfield citizenry rise up and form an angry mob out to get the Simpsons.As I said, there's nudity - but, sadly, it's not anyone you'd want to see naked. No, not even Patty or Selma. And, believe it or not, there's death! Of course, it's not like any of the Simpsons themselves die, or even a secondary character. But hey, there are literally scores of characters in the Simpsons universe, so it's okay if one of them bites it, right? And double hey, it's not as if the movie is part of any grand continuity - if someone gets hurt in the movie, I'm betting they'll be peachy keen next time you see them in the TV show.To be sure, even though there's some envelope pushing and such, the characters remain who they are - Homer is a complete screwup who somehow manages to both destroy and save everyone at least once; Bart is a selfish brat who picks on his sister and is susceptible to dares; Lisa is a dreamy brain who pines for a new boy; and Marge is the proverbial glue that usually holds them somewhat together.The movie's not very long, which might be its only real debit. It's wildly amusing, and the movie makes the best use out of its short running time, being chock full o' jokes and references that only Comic Book Guys in their mom's basement will get. Thankfully, there are very few celebrity voices - one Name does the voice of the chief bad guy, with the EPA, and another plays himself. (I'm not even including the brief appearance by Green Day, though.) I like that - it'd be too easy for the Bigwigs to shovel in celebrity after celebrity, as has happened in many a Simpsons episode over the years.Our favorite yellow family survives its first foray onto the silver screen - the movie is so well done, it feels like an episode from the middle years of the series without seeming like a simple extension of the show. It's hysterical, appropriately raunchy, and just absurd enough to be the ne plus ultra of animated movies. Well, at least those that are animated in a traditional (i.e., not wholly computerized) style. So pass the donuts and gulp down your Duff brew!",8,2,7,28 July 2007
The Fighter," Unsentimental and dull
","The FighterIn this true-life sports film, a boxer fights against himself and outside influences to excel against all odds and earn that elusive title shot. In other words, it's virtually identical to every other boxing movie. It's distinguishable only in that the f-word is used about three times a sentence and that Amy Adams gives an improbably iron-willed performance as Mark Wahlberg's bartender girlfriend. But overall, the movie is completely forgettable.Micky Ward (Wahlberg) is a small-time fighter from the mean streets of Lowell, Massachusetts; his older brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale) is a former pro who once knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down, so naturally the elder wants the younger to succeed. Trouble is, Micky not only is beset by self doubt (he's lost three fights in a row), he also has to put up with his crackhead half brother and his overbearing, greedy mother (Melissa Leo). So, again, like most other boxing films.True to form, the movie takes us through Micky's career, first as a stepping stone for other fighters and then, gradually, to the bigger time (Las Vegas and then England). The first half of the movie contains little actual fighting in a ring, then there's a boxing montage (original!) depicting several fights in the space of a couple of minutes, all leading up to the inevitable title bout. For a movie that uses so much profanity, this one was awfully dull. Hardly anything happens that isn't completely predictable. It's almost as if director David O. Russell set out to make a parody of boxing films. This movie doesn't just use clichés indiscriminately, it robs the cliché bank blind. It's obvious to the audience from the get-go that Micky's family is holding him back (especially his crazy mother and addict brother), so it's no surprise when he makes the hard decision to move on without them - just as it's no surprise that somehow they wind up helping him, anyway. Part of what inhibits things is the fact that everyone surrounding Micky seems to be more caricature than character. Everyone's weird just to be weird, outlandish just to try to stand out. And none of it rings true, not for a second - except for Adams as Charlene. Now, if you've seen Amy Adams in anything, you'd be hard pressed to imagine her as a foul-mouthed barkeep who wears short shorts and low-cut tops. And yet here she is, and among all the hysterical, chaotic performances hers is the true standout. She brings a lot more depth to Charlene than anyone else does to their own roles. The worst of the lot is the otherwise-talented Melissa Leo, who plays Alice Ward as if she were the queen of harpy shrews. Alice berates everyone with a nicotine-tinged screech designed to set your teeth on edge. She also appears to be patterned directly after Linda McMahon of the WWE (and most recently a candidate for governor of Connecticut), complete with hair color and style. It's not a favorable comparison. One mistake that the movie makes concerns its identity. Is it a serious sports drama? Sometimes, yes; but other times it lapses into basic slapstick. Micky's sisters (or half sisters, I lost track) are like a coven of parrots that exist merely to be the Greek chorus of anger toward anyone they perceive as threatening their family (like, say, Charlene) or to cheerlead for Micky. When the sisters and dear ol' mom figure decide to head over to Charlene's house to scream at her, the scene quickly devolves into Keystone Kops and vaudeville. Rather than being comic relief, it's just sort of embarrassing to watch.All that aside, what really underlines the inept nature of this beast is that the lead characters aren't emotionally engaging, or engaging on any level. By the end, I didn't care if Micky Ward got his title bout, as I found him spineless and stupid and merely an average (looking) boxer. I didn't care at all about his ne'er-do-well brother Dickie, even after he's sent to jail, as I found him obnoxious and dimwitted (even though he loves his bro, surprise!). I didn't care about Alice, who spends 95% of the movie cursing people out for no good reason. It's tough caring about characters when they simply don't give you any reason to. So when bad things happen to them, you're not affected.It's often unfair to compare movies if they were released decades apart. But we can compare The Fighter with 2005's Cinderella Man, which was also based on a real-life fighter. Russell Crowe and director Ron Howard crafted a story that was plausible and filled with believable characters for whom you could root. It's not that Micky Ward isn't a good guy, it's that he lacks a personality. A personality would have gone a long way toward engaging the viewer. And, true to its clichéd nature, the film tries to save itself with your garden-variety title match, akin to the Championship Game in just about every baseball movie made. I'll leave it to you to decide how it ends, although the fact that the movie is based on a true story might be a clue.",4,10,19,17 January 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Senseless, predictable, sloppy
","F. Gary Gray's Law Abiding Citizen, about a man using violence to bring down the legal system while behind bars, falls under the weight of its own premise. Butler and Foxx are good, but movie pretends there's a cat-and-mouse game afoot; Foxx's DA has little to do but run from explosion to explosion, and by the end logic and continuity have been cheerfully tossed out the window.Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is an average guy who's victimized by a home invasion, during which his wife and daughter are murdered while he watches, tied up. The bad guys are rounded up, and district attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) gets one of them to sell out the other, thus making a deal that allows the first to get off scot free. As you might imagine, this doesn't sit too well with Mr. Shelton, who is not happy that the deal was made without his knowledge or input.Flash forward ten years later, and the convicted felon is about to be executed, and it turns out to not be a particularly pleasant execution - things go wrong, the bad guy suffers a painful death, and so on. Rice eventually puts two and two together and figures out that Shelton's behind it - but it seems that there's more to the situation than meets the eye, as Shelton has an entirely different agenda in mind. And thus begins the nominal cat-and-mouse game, as Shelton continues to wreak havoc while in solitary confinement in Philadelphia's maximum-security prison.For me, the movie fails on several levels. Although it does have plenty of well-staged action scenes, the logic needed to sustain what's really a psychological thriller is absent in large quantities, as the so-called good guys' actions often don't make much sense other than to propel the plot a bit more.First and foremost is the motivation. Shelton is mad because Rice took the deal that let one of the guys who murdered his (Shelton's) family go free. Shelton then decides to 'show' everyone involved that their system of justice isn't optimal for anyone other than the bad guys; to illustrate this point, he decides to bump off those who had anything to do with the plea bargain. Which makes sense to a point, but Shelton then extends that logic to include anyone involved with those involved with the plea bargain, and even those who happen to be idly walking by (figuratively speaking).So at first, we're meant to think that Shelton's a victim here (he is), and we really should root for him. We're in his corner. Rice is an egotistical jerkwad who barely notices his family and doesn't prosecute unless he's assured of a victory, so he's easily seen as a bad guy. But over the course of the film, sympathy for Shelton and his situation completely disappears. Which would have been fine if Rice had been shown as an equal match for Shelton's wits - he was instead led around by his nose, constantly several steps behind the villain.And therein lies a crucial problem with the movie: it's predictable. Yes, there are some scenes that will make you jump, but Gray takes so long in setting them up that you sort of expect them to happen. There's also the problem of showing the best action scenes in the previews and trailers, so you know those are upcoming as well.This is a standard revenge action film with a twist (i.e., that the antagonist is behind bars while most of the mayhem is occurring) that doesn't even make sense at the end of the movie. Let me put it this way, to avoid spoilers. Throughout the movie, you're wondering how Shelton is able to accomplish his violent deeds while in solitary confinement - really, the only thing the movie has going for it - but when you find out his secret, it's so mundane and eminently avoidable that you wonder what all the fuss was about. In fact, the ending itself is senseless, as a better alternative certainly was available.You also wonder if Shelton's point about the injustice of the justice system was even really made; Shelton's slaughter of the innocents doesn't prove that the system is injust, it just proves he's a sadistic murderer.I was fortunate enough to witness a question-and-answer session with director Gray after the movie. I took the following from the session: 1. F. Gary Gray likes doing different types of movies, because he wants to avoid being typecast. And yet this movie wasn't cinematically much different than, say The Negotiator or even Set It Off. So I'm not sure this was an accurate point.2. F. Gary Gray doesn't think this movie is anything like The Dark Knight. An audience member drew the parallel, but the director seemed to think that his movie was much better than the Batman movie, and he downplayed any thematic similarities. Here's why they're similar. Each film has a psychotic bad guy who spends much of the film trying to get under the protagonist's skin - and usually succeeds while in custody of law enforcement. Both films are dark, psychological thrillers. Both films have antagonists who have more vibrant personalities than their respective foils. The films differ in that the performance of one actor (Heath Ledger) was monumentally better than that of the corresponding bad guy (Butler).Law Abiding Citizen, hyphen or no hyphen, is an overblown, illogical mess that can be a lot of fun to watch if one checks one's brain at the door and isn't concerned with such notions as cohesion and reason. Things go explody. The end.",5,26,42,15 October 2009
Up in the Air," Strong performances, likable script, lack of stereotyping
","As firer-for-hire Ryan Bingham, George Clooney is perfectly cast in Jason Reitman's Up in the Air, and the script, based on a novel by Walter Kim, crackles with wit and maturity. Only a predictable final twenty minutes or so prevents the movie from being a bittersweet classic.Ryan is what you call a real frequent flyer; he's the proud owner of millions of miles in the air and scores of elite-status cards and chotchkies. His company sends him to other companies for the sole purpose of letting go staff, rather than having the senior staff do it. (Wussies.) Anyway, it pays very well, but Ryan's on the road over 250 days a year. But he gets star treatment literally everywhere, so it all works out okay.However, Ryan's boss (played by an oily Jason Bateman) wants to try something a little different. A newcomer to the team, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), has the bright idea of firing people remotely. This way road warriors like Ryan could stay at home, thus saving the company travel expenses. Bateman likes it, Clooney's Ryan does not – and why would he? He'd lose all the perks of traveling, probably lose a lot of salary, and have to deal with real life for a change. He pitches enough of a fit that boss Bateman sends him back on the road – with Natalie. You know, to show her the ropes.Which actually brings us to one of the more poignant parts of the film. We see Ryan lowering the boom on senior management and junior staffers alike, and their reactions (from acting calmly to pouring bleach in the coffee). Reitman actually brought in people who had just lost their jobs, so their reactions are more are less genuine (they were instructed to react either as they actually did when informed of losing their jobs or how they wish they had reacted). The theme couldn't be more timely, with the American economy doing so poorly and so many people out of work. Ryan has to deliver the news professionally and implacably, something that the straightlaced Natalie cannot always do.A secondary thread has to do with Ryan's relationships, those with his family and those with, well, other people in general. His sister is getting married, but he's so self-absorbed that he can't find time to care much about it. Then Ryan meets cute with a fellow traveler in an airport bar (Vera Farmiga) and falls in lust with what he sees as a kindred spirit.That's another important theme here, really: the perceived isolation in which Ryan finds himself. Sure, he's surrounded by people all the time, but he has intentionally never pursued any kind of meaningful relationship, choosing instead to put more stock in the elite status that million-mile travelers get.You might think that because Natalie is on the road with Ryan, the two will inevitably hook up. But this is a more-mature look at relationships than Hollywood is used to churning out. Typically, you'd expect physical sparks to fly, because Clooney is Clooney and age differences mean little in Hollywood if we're talking an older man and a younger woman. But both Kendrick and Clooney are lights-out amazing; Kendrick in particular is tremendously effective as the inexperienced go-getter. Natalie is certainly not perfect, but she's also not a one-dimension prude, either. In fact, the scenes in which she explains herself – whether it's to a group of downsizers or to Ryan himself – are where the picture truly shines. Kendrick's artful delivery evokes both sympathy and envy for Natalie, who's in her situation of her own volition and accord.And you might also think that because Alex (Farmiga) and Ryan meet on the road and have some fun that their relationship will immediately dissolve into a pool of boring. It's not so. Farmiga – a largely unknown quantity to me – was fantastic, playing Alex neither as another conquest for the Ryan Express nor as the kind of woman who will settle down with someone forever and ever. In fact, she's more than a match for Clooney in the charm department.The movie loses its way, slightly, near the end, when a twist arrives with as little subtlety as possible. You'll probably be able to spot the plot change from a mile away. That's about the only thing that keeps this from being a superb movie, a sagging denouement, but certainly the three standout performances are nothing to be sneezed at.",7,14,26,16 December 2009
Atonement," Faceless, joyless, festival of dung
","Don't make the mistake of thinking that this movie is a twisty-curvy, tightly plotted suspense thriller on the order of Notes on a Scandal. Instead of a plot that takes plausible but largely unforeseeable left turns, Atonement's story is obvious, too blunt, and crackling with cliché. Everything, from the haphazard direction and editing to the numb acting, is a bit of an embarrassment to all involved.Wildly overrated, Atonement is closer in style and scope to a Merchant-Ivory film, so if that's your cup of tea, you might like this one a little more than I did. But it's more like the dimwitted, held-back-in-school bastard child of such films, because although it contains all the proper hoity-toity attitude and pretty costumery, it has none of the subtlety or charm - in short, the characters are all largely unsympathetic, giving the audience no one to root for. This isn't always a deal breaker for me, but when the characters are dull, vapid, vacuous space takers, it does sort of put a damper on things.At age 13, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) is a pretentious, self-possessed newbie writer. She's supposed to be a child prodigy of sorts, but she seems more perfunctory than imaginative (to be sure, we don't get much of a glimpse of her writing efforts at that age; it's merely implied how great she is). She harbors a crush on the handsome, strapping son (James McAvoy) of her wealthy family's housekeeper, who has long had eyes for Briony's older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). On a hot summer day, Briony illicitly reads a note from Robbie (McAvoy) intended for Cecilia (gasp) and then later sees something she shouldn't have. Subsequently the girl swears to seeing something she definitely didn't see, her perspective colored by her feelings for Robbie and her interception of the note. This irrevocably alters the lives of all three, of course.The movie jumps around quite a bit, timewise, which at one point was an interesting approach to film-making but more often than not nowadays seems sort of played out and unnecessary; here it's done to confuse the audience a little bit, some trickery thrown in to distract from the fact that the plot itself is fairly bland and melodramatic. Because of Briony's misinterpretation, Robbie winds up in prison and later in the military, fighting in WW II. Much of the film describes his attempts to get back to London to be with Cecilia. Cecilia, meanwhile, works as a waitress - a job that's a bit lower than her family's station should allow. Briony forgoes attending an exclusive writing academy and becomes a nurse, all owing to her guilt (not to mention her obstinacy).But what does it all mean? That one person's sworn testimony can screw up the lives of somewhat-innocent people? Oh, there's news. In the end, it all feels like much ado about nothing. Has Briony truly atoned for her sin? Of course not. She didn't have the guts to say anything when she had the power to do so; to make herself feel better, she writes a novel over the course of the rest of her life. So, no real atonement, just a general sense of comfort and insincere assuaging of guilt.I think that's the crux of the issue here - the movie feels insincere. Are Robbie and Cecilia madly in love, or do they just want to have hot sex all the time? Little in the early half of the movie indicates the former, and plenty of evidence is shown for the latter. But even if they are in love well, here is where the issue of What the Movie Is crops up; this is not a psychological thriller, it's a dopey romance movie. It's a chick flick, even with some truly garish and probably unnecessary war scenes. (Do we really need to see burn victims? How does this further the plot?) The script is even based on a romance novel, by Ian McEwan. If pining for lost loves sounds like a grand old time to you, by all means dive into this murky, tortured movie.As for the casting, it's not terrible. Knightley, who has said she wants to play more mature roles, continues to look like a tall, bug-eyed boy, with her shapeless, bony figure. She's not a bad actress, but she might have been a little in over her depth here; at no point did I feel sympathy toward Cecilia, although she's supposed to be a victim here. McAvoy (The Last King of Scotland) looks a little more girlish here than Knightley does, what with his impossibly red lips, even in the war scenes.So. If you're expecting a thick-plotted, twisty thriller about what happens when a lie spirals out of control, this is not the movie for you; if you like costume dramas with actors rising to their material, this is also not the movie for you; if you like love stories with no apparent happy ending and actors sinking to melodramatic depths, this is a winner.",2,34,68,11 January 2008
V for Vendetta," Slick, but still chaotic
","The Wachowski Brothers' stab at stylistic sociopolitical commentary is visually arresting, compelling stuff, a fine homage to its graphic novel source. It's artful, if perhaps missing a dash or a smidge of subtlety, but not so much that one is entirely distracted from the somewhat pedestrian, familiar plot.V is a vigilante, a lone avenger who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and wants to extol the masses of a somewhat-futuristic London to rise up against their oppressors, throw off the yoke of totalitarianism, and watch their favorite buildings explode.It's the near future. Britain no longer has a queen or prime minister; instead, it has a chancellor, an ominous man named Setler (John Hurt) who appears on giant TV screens, a la Big Brother. And freedoms have been seriously curtailed, especially free speech, owing to three terrorist incidents in which nearly 100,000 people die. This leads to state-controlled media, secret police, and so-called black baggers, the men who come in the middle of the night to round up people deemed Bad by the government.When a young Londoner named Evey (Natalie Portman) is caught out after a state-imposed curfew by the secret police and is then attacked by said defenders of the realm, a debonair, eloquent masked marvel springs to her aid, dispatching with her aggressors with all due speed. He quotes Shakespeare and looks like a Musketeer, complete with swirling black cape and superpointy blades, but wears a portentous mask - that of noted British rebel/hero Guy Fawkes, who once tried to blow up Parliament some 400 years ago. The mysterious man rescues Evey and spirits her away to his secret lair. Later, he shows her part of his plans as a famed statue detonates.'You can call me V,' the man says, and although the letter stands for Vendetta in the title, it's also a good stand in for Vengeance, Vituperation, and Vanquishment. Clearly, V is harboring some kind of grudge on someone, and he's going to try to turn the country upside down, show the populace how corrupt and Fascist their government - which they've elected - has become. He's an anarchist at his heart, it seems, but could there also be a more personal vendetta rampaging in his mind? V sees Evey as a necessary ally and enlists her in his cause, an entreaty she accepts. But is she willing to go as far as V is? From the scared-kitten look on Portman's face through much of the movie, one would assume she's not quite sure she's made the right choice.At times, the movie is very powerful propaganda, demanding that the viewer draw parallels between the celluloid events and those occurring in the real world today. But it's not heavy handed in its execution; everything that we see on screen is quite plausible, at least in the context of the fictional futuristic London.There are some similarities between this film and the Matrix series, also by the Wachowskis, including the overall look and feel of the set designs and the idea that we're all being controlled by someone or something else. But unlike The Matrix, V for Vendetta isn't terribly deep of a movie; it's not a movie that invites endless philosophical discussions about Who We Are and Why We're Here. We know just enough for the sake of the movie, and we're not left wanting to know more. There aren't many twists, nothing to keep your brain hopping along, always wondering what might come next.There IS one big twist, however. Some viewers might think of it as a shaggy-dog outcome, though, and others might completely buy into it. It's the kind of twist that may well make you scratch your head and wonder if the actions in the twist were really all that necessary - the old ends-justifies-the-means adage.Hugo Weaving, so wonderful as Agent Smith in the Matrix movies, plays V, and although we never once get to see Mr. Weaving's face, he turns in a powerful, commanding performance. You can feel what V feels, and without the crutch of a countenance on which to make expressions, this is fantastic acting indeed. Portman is okay as Evey, but her character wasn't sufficiently substantive, which is my way of saying I don't think it was Portman's fault. I think she did an admirable job considering what she had to work with; in this movie, Evey is relegated to less-than-sidekick status.And I would be remiss if I did not add that the final scene is both satisfying and unsatisfying, which makes it a little frustrating. Part of it grabbed my heart and made it soar, but part also did seem a tad expected.V for Vendetta is, at times, invigorating, exciting, revolutionary, and terrifying, but it's a little slicker than its subject material should indicate.",7,2,7,18 March 2006
The Island," Loud, but fun
","The Island is a loud, superfluous cacophony of explosions and gunplay interrupted by quick bouts of sci-fi plotting. I half expected Tom Cruise to be the lead Action Dude, because forces conspire against Lincoln Six Echo, and his world is not as he thought it was. Shades of Minority Report! (One of the cars from MR even makes an appearance here.) And just about any other Tom Cruise vehicle.But no, we get Ewan McGregor as Lincoln, and I think that's for the best. Lincoln Six Echo is one of thousands of people who live in an idyllic community underground. They've been told that the outside world was contaminated somehow, and they are the last survivors. And every evening, the community holds a lottery to determine which of the inhabitants gets to go to The Island, the last safe aboveground paradise.Lincoln's been having some odd dreams, though, and he decides to Investigate, as hero types are wont to do, and he quickly discovers life ain't really all that idyllic, as he and the other inhabitants are clones for people in the outside world, clones that are being kept for spare parts or for out-and-out replacements, should the originals actually die. Now, if you were good ol' Lincoln Six Echo, what would you do? You probably wouldn't run to the head of the community, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), because he's obviously a bad guy. No, you'd grab your gal pal Jordan Two Delta (Scarlet Johannson), who's just won the nightly lottery, and amscray. And naturally, then all hell breaks loose as the fugitives are chased hither and yon.Say what you will about most Michael Bay movies, that they're loud, incomprehensible babble masquerading as a seamless plot, but the movies can be quite entertaining if viewed with the right perspective. Bay uses his trademark pulsating soundtrack that coincides neatly with the on screen explosions to great effect, interspersing plenty of well-done chase scenes around such plot movers as the Helpful Friend (played here by Steve Buscemi, who's very well cast) and the Mercenary with a Conscience (played here by Dijimon Hounsou, from Amistad).It's sort of like watching an amalgam of The Sixth Day, Minority Report, and Payback, with a dollop of Armaggedon tossed in as a dessert topping. McGregor is far better than Schwarzenegger, Cruise, or Affleck could hope to be, and Johansson does very well in a love-interest role, certainly doing more for the film than the film does for her. Also appearing is Ethan Phillips, who once played Peter on the long-ago TV series Benson, and Michael Clarke Duncan, another winner of the lottery.So aside from the loudness and the sometimes poor writing, The Island really isn't all that bad, owing in no small part to the appealing, symbiotic performances by McGregor and Johannson.The Island: ***",7,1,1,24 June 2006
Semi-Pro," Mostly Alley, little Oop
","Look! It's another comedy starring Will Ferrell as a man-child in a strange haircut! Will it be funny? Yes, because of two things: First, it's set in the 1970s, which was the funniest decade (to laugh at) ever, and second, it's a sports movie, and those are almost always awesome. It has wacky characters in improbable scenarios, and it has scantily clad women and profanity. It's a can't-lose comedy.It's 1976, and Jackie Moon's Flint, Michigan Tropics are part of the American Basketball Association (ABA), which has just announced plans to merge with the more-popular National Basketball Association. Trouble is, only the top four teams will be assimilated, and the Tropics are pretty awful. About all they have going for them is the attitude of Moon, their owner/coach/player, and the play of their best player, Clarence 'Coffee' Black (Andre Benjamin). The Tropics have acquired a seasoned veteran named Monix (Woody Harrelson), who has a championship ring from his time with the Boston Celtics in hopes of making it up to fourth place. Can they do it? Minor-league sports have long been ripe for parody; see Slap Shot or Bull Durham. But there's something doubly appealing about the wild and woolly lower-level pro leagues combined with the zany, colorful atmosphere of the 1970s. I mean, look at the fashions! The hairstyles! The sheer loudness! Semi-Pro is reminiscent (and perhaps a little derivative) of Slap Shot more than anything else, and that's a compliment. Slap Shot more or less set the standard for lowbrow sports comedies (Bull Durham was much more sophisticated), and it included elements that made their way into Semi-Pro as well, such as the walking-cliché sportscasters and the bed-hopping chicanery - there's just no plot thread that has Ferrell hooking up with the ex-wife of one of his players, like Paul Newman in Slap Shot. But that's okay; in fact, Moon actually makes note of his lack of sexual prowess in a talk to the ball girls - 'Some of you I wanted to sleep with, but I never got around to it...Mama always said I procrastinate too much...' The movie works also because Moon, like many of Will Ferrell's goofy characters, never takes himself seriously. He's just a showman in a showy lower-level league. He's immensely popular in Flint, but more as a promoter of his team and the city than of an actual player or coach. In truth, he can't play OR coach, but somehow the Tropics will do okay regardless.The supporting cast is a lot of fun, too. Somewhere along the line, Woody Harrelson (North Country, No Country for Old Men) has turned into a very good character actor. Love his Dutch Boy haircut here - or is it a Dorothy Hamill? Or maybe it's Mike Patterson's wife Deanna from the comic strip For Better or for Worse. Regardless, his Monix is fantastic, excelling in the athletic scenes as well as the slower dramatic scenes. (It's his second basketball movie, following 1992's White Men Can't Jump.) Maura Tierney as his ex-lover, Andrew Daly as a buttoned-down broadcaster, and Andy Richter as Jackie's 'son-friend' are all great as well.I think it goes without saying that if you like Will Ferrell movies, you'll like this one. It's got plenty for your inner frat boy to love, from lewd comments to a plethora of profanity. No nudity, though, so you skin aficionados can relax. Or get irate, whatever. But the script is punchy and a lot of fun, and Ferrell brings it all together.***",7,5,10,2 March 2008
