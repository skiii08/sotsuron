Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Most of you didn't understand it
","I've seen this film a long time ago, and bought the dvd and then seen it again and again...well, I'm surprised about the low voting it had. It makes me think that most of you haven't understood the importance of this film, and (much important) haven't read none of the comic-novels of the Star Wars universe. With the exception of the Jar Jar character (really disturbing the film for its excessive clumsy presence), I think this Episode is the perfect introduction to the entire SW-movie saga: the atmosphere is positive, shiny, rich, elegant and it couldn't be different because nothing happened yet. Note the elegance of the starships, of the dresses, even of the droids: they're going to be in contrast with the 'darkness' that's going to come and that it's going to show clearly, to me, only in Episode III; and what about the continuous links to what's going to happen (see the ascending of Palpatine, the thoughts of Yoda during Qui Gon's funeral, etc...)? And, again, the EPIC battle between Qui Gon-Obi Wan and Darth Maul (great character)? And the one between Gungans and Droids? Believe me when I say that I'm sure most of you are going to change their mind about it...",7,1,3,20 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Simply....wordless
","I've seen SW-II, yesterday night, and...what to say? Simply perfect! Again, George confirmed his genius in directing, in creating and transmitting emotions. The film is complete: romantic, dramatic, astonishing, breathtaking, 2:30 hours of pure amusement. The characters are well-'designed', the actors well selected and, obvious, perfectly directed, and the battles...wow, a real thrilling experience! The moment I saw Yoda taking his lightsabre to duel with Dooku...unforgettable. And what about the perfect way of describing the Anakin's dangerous behavior that will lead him to the Dark Side? First, I was very frightened about this film, because it represented a milestone thru the entire SW saga, so there was the risk it could 'ruin' all the good work done before, but then...I even stayed for the following projection, and it won't be the last, you can count on it! At the end, a prophecy: SW-III will be the best SW episode ever, the confirmation that George Lucas is one of the best directors ever lived, together with Sergio Leone, Stanley Kubrick and less more... Jesus, still 3 years...how will we do?",8,0,0,18 May 2002
