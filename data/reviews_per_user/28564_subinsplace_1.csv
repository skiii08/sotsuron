It," Wasted my time
","Worst movie ever! What was all that hype about? People who got scared watching 'it' should just go watch a real horror movie. Horribly written script, poor direction, not so scary looking CG characters, and no character development whatsoever. I haven't read the novel but if this was all 'it' was about then please don't make any more movies with 'it'",1,0,2,21 December 2017
