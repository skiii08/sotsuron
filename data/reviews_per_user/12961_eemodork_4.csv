Kill Bill: Vol. 2," wow
","I am a huge fan of the first. i missed vol.1 in theater (worst mistake of my life) but dl it on my computer and fell in love. I own the dvd and call it my bible. so i was expecting a lot from the second.and i was overwhelmed by the movie. it was incredible. the first one, though amazing, leaves u in a daze from its kinetic pace. The pace of this one is slower, but it allows for more brutality (bride vs elle) more sympathy and more love for the movie.David carradine is amazing in this movie. You know he is a ruthless fuck, but you love him anyways. uma once again delvers an incredible performance. she owns the world of onscreen heriones bc she is strong, yet feminine, brutal, but elegant. Uma tops her performance in kill bill vol. 1, which i thought was impossible.tarantino's direction in this is better as well. Yes there are referneces to his fav styles of movies and whatnot, but it isnt as obvious as in the first one. I love that about the second one. and his script is astounding. i love his words and his superman speech.other good thinngs: godon lui as pai mei (wut a scene), daryl hannah (never thought she was a good actress until now) and the burial scene(wow... creepy as hell).please be smart, oscars, and vote for a truely amazing movie and give props to tarrantino and company for creating 2 movies of incredible power andsubstance. (i doubt it will happen though)",10,1,3,21 April 2004

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," incredible
","its been a long time since i have connected with a movie like this... it was an icredible sciencefiction/comedy/romance/drama movie that has impressed me farther than any film in the my short life. Jim Carrey's performance is so sharp and controlled. I dont know if it is a fluke or not ( jim was great in both man on he moon and the truman show, but nothing else has impressed me, except cable guy, but thats because of stiller, but i digress) but i dont think anyone else could have done as an astounding job on this film as carrey. Kate winslet was just a  firecracker on screen. She was smart, sexy, hysterical, strong, loud, obnoxious, ingenious, temperate, and for me, she just lit up the screen and made me fall in love with her. The supporting cast is strong as well. Wilkinson gives another solid perfomace. Mark ruffalo is a force to be recokened with, and gave a heartwrenching performance/ Elijah wood, though underwritten, is great and it was good seeing outside LOTR, and Kirstin Dunst was phenomenal. I wasnt the biggest fan of her in anything besides Interview with the Vampire, and this was a warm welcome for me. The direction is phenomenal. Gondry makes a cinematic wonder, and its the little thing, like when the labels on the books, and how it was all slowly disappearing and it was just so subtle for me, and the angles of the shots, and the way he seems to be in total control. He could have let the movie spin out of control in joels dreams, but he doesnt. A superb job. The script was incredible. I love the way kaufman writes. it was sooo goood. he just has the speed and flow that no one else does. other highlights- the editing, the cinemtography, and kates hair- i liked it alot.",10,0,1,20 March 2004
