"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," 'would it be weird if I took a bath?'; Enjoyable, just nothing special
","I think there are three reasons why people would want to check out Run Fatboy Run: as a normal movie going, or just viewing, experience (certainly mostly if you are a fan of comedies), to check out what Simon Pegg can do without Nick Frost and Edgar Wright (I belong to this 'category' as a fan of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) and to check out the first feature film of David Schwimmer (fans of the show Friends that are curious to see freakin' Ross behind the camera). First of all, Run Fatboy Run is one of those pictures that any director could have made. I mean, if you're interested in this film because of David Schwimmer well, there's really nothing that sort of indicates how Schwimmer is as a director. In other words, Run Fatboy Run is, simply, generic stuff. It follows the same old structure, and it is sort of aware of its very predictable storyline. I mean, the film places Simon Pegg's character (Dennis, the 'fatboy' of the title) as a guy who, simply, wants to win back his old fiancée (played by Thandie Newton) the rich and athletic Whit (played by Hank Azaria) is the rival. So we have that Dennis wants to win her back doing what a movie character would do: beat his, athletic, rival at a marathon. I say that the film is aware of being generic since Newton's character is like 'so you win the marathon, and then what? You think I will forget that you leaved me the day of our wedding just because you win a marathon? This is not a movie', towards Dennis' plan. I guess you know how this movie ends, here the issue is that no matter what Dennis will run the marathon to prove that he can finish something and everybody will see the a****** Whit is, no matter what he will win back the woman yes, the film knows that its storyline is the same of always but it doesn't really care, it goes for the usual. Still it's enjoyable but not very memorable (just like Simon Pegg's performance) Dylan Moran, as Dennis' buddy Gordon, delivers: 'Who's gonna want to buy tickets for something that happened yesterday?' 'Time travelers'. 'Would it be weird if I took a bath?'.",Null,0,1,2 March 2010
Changeling," There Will Be Hope
","CHANGELING 9.5/10 Almost a year after Clint Eastwood's Changeling premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival I finally saw it and I saw it exactly on 11 March 2009, I saw it one day after another anniversary (the number 81) of the disappearing of Christine Collins' son Walter Collins, certainly it took place on 10 March 1928. As you know Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins (for me her very best performance so far) and the story begins on 9 March 1928, everything is normal, Christine and her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) are going to see a movie next day, maybe the new Charles Chaplin movie but for something the plan can't go on, Christine has go out and then happens, a tragedy and is just the beginning. There will be justice, hope but for once we have nothing but a damn perfect time for all of those corrupts. Let's see, woman's son disappears, some months after if you have the chance why not bring an abandoned child who says his name is Walter Collins and say that finally Christine will meet again with her son but how act when Christine will say that his son is still missing, well is kind of easy, say that after months a child certainly changes and stuff. So now this case is over, you must act like just the f****** bastard you are and every time Christine argues that the boy you brought is not Walter well just say to her stuff like 'so you were just fine alone, you liked it and now that your son is back you don't like it anymore, now you just don't want responsibilities'.So meanwhile people think that Christine is finally again with her son she will go with people that knew Walter, there's no doubt but certainly the kid that the police brought as Walter calls her mom, the corrupts thought that for Christine would be enough that any kid call her mother to forget about her son? Of course not but they certainly will have all under control so Christine can come and denounce that the police made a mistake and that they should be trying to find her son and stuff but the irresponsible mother will be her, the one who will go direct to the psychopathic ward. And inside the hospital we have a typical part, typical in the way that Christine must admit that she was wrong and that the boy the police brought is her son otherwise she will basically die there. And is all pretty well clear and all the women that are there because of a problem in which a police officer was the guilty know what will happen if they fight and of course Christine will fight. On the other hand there's this case that certainly has nothing related with the case of Christine's missing son, a simple case of a Canadian boy who has to be deported. So we meet another young boy of the four in the film and again when this Canadian boy talks he certainly don't know if what he is saying will be relevant in the case of Walter Collins however it will be and it will bring some justice, some satisfying moments. Certainly this film is a difficult one in the way that it begins and we have a missing child, certainly the pain of the mother only to meet those corrupts and to see how Christine's life is in danger. But certainly what the Canadian boy says is just as hopeless as horrible, as unbelievable as real. The film's last part is full of justice with answers yet for Christine is not time to stop thinking that his son is still alive somewhere, certainly for some moments we and the people near Christine, John Malkovich's character Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb, wish resignation. Certainly there are not enough proves to confirm that Walter Collins was one of the many children that were brutally murdered by Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) and his nephew Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson), the Canadian boy, but is just very difficult to think that Walter was not one of those children. The killer Gordon Northcott says to Christine that he didn't murdered Walter and at one point near, the day in which Gordon will be hung from neck until dead, Gordon requests that Christine travels to see him since he will say the truth about what happened with Walter, certainly whatever is the confession of Gordon will bring some peace to Christine yet this won't happen until years after Gordon's execution when we meet the last of the four young boys in the film, there will be hope. A magnificent cast (not only Jolie but Malkovich, Jeffrey Donovan as one of the corrupt bastards, Harner and Michael Kelly, as a fine police detective, are simply fantastic), long but never boring or uninteresting, Changeling is a true piece of work and is together with Mystic River (first place) and Letters from Iwo Jima my favourite Clint Eastwood film from this decade yet I have still to see Flags of Our Fathers and Gran Torino (that will be released in my city on 27 March 2009).",Null,3,4,12 March 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," High-five!
","Borat is a reporter of Kazakhstan who travels to the US to learn more about the American culture. Since having lessons to know how to talk English to lessons of manners to eat, Borat travel around the US to marry Pamela Anderson.Sacha Baron Cohen change a lot from his 2002 film 'Ali G Indahouse' that was just good to this film that is, for me, the best American comedy of 2006 along with Jack Black stuff and maybe ranks in the best comedies ever made. Borat was taken as an insult but they only want to see the bad points of film, for me is just that, i mean is just a film, a very good one. What i like of Borat is that he show to us how the people whit many prejudices are and Cohen put this in a very funny way. I love specially when he is the rodeo and a guy ask him if he can cut off his mustache because he looks like a terrorist and later in the same rodeo Borat sings about the war in Iraq and support Bush and everybody is happy. I mean those people must be a shame of their attitude and that's why everybody demand and want to banned the film. Sorry for those guys.Finally: really good idea, good points of Cohen and really funny from the beginning until the end. 10 out of 10DVD: It was really great to can watch the delete scenes and the premiers of Borat all around the world and also the commercial of the film soundtrack, really funny stuff. The idea of the bootleg disc is just original and great but i wish they could put some of the episodes when Borat appears in The Ali G show that are great.PS: this is my second comment for this film, the first one was deleted by IMDb based on an abuse report by another user. I don't understand why, it was similar to this one but anyway now that the craze for this film is almost over i decide to put another comment because those users with bad reviews for the film have only 1 comment so i think they won't come back to this site to lose their time.",10,2,5,13 January 2008
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Mr. Green vs. The Abominable Mr. Orange
","First, I have seen only parts of Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk but never complete so if you want comparisons I can't give that to you. That said, let's focus on Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk; even that this film is like a reboot it begins more like a sequel, actually when Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is already in his 'exile' due to his 'green' problem. During his stay in Brazil, he has an accident that will put him again on the map of the US Army (in part courtesy of Stan Lee). Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) is their 'special weapon' and now we have just a search of Banner, who travels from Brazil to Guatemala to Mexico to finally the United States. There he meets again his love, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), and the rounds between Hulk and the Army really begins. The visual part is great and delivers a terrific Hulk and a terrific fight at the University. Tim Roth's character seems to be in personal fight against Hulk but at this point of the film, he is the only one who really believes that. I mean, the guy claims 'well this is our second round' or something like that but actually he hasn't even touch Hulk during their first meet in Brazil and in the University Hulk beats him easily (funny scene by the way). Of course when Abomination finally appears, courtesy of Banner's helper Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), Hulk will have a true rival. Both deliver pure action in the climax of the film, and the entire film is just that: pure and fun action entertainment that, I guess, will be enjoyed by the true fans of the comic book.Cast: For me Norton was a great choice for the role because he normally looks as a very calm guy like Banner, when he is in a sort of hangover after being Hulk all night, but sometimes Norton looks quite different for stronger roles (for example in American History X as Derek Vinyard). Tim Roth is also quite good, again on a blockbuster, and for me to have him in the cast is enough to can say that this Hulk has a better cast that the 2003 Hulk. Before this film, I haven't see Liv Tyler since Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Kings and here she looks beautiful as usual but her role is quite common yet I think she is just good. Two cameos: Lou Ferrigno appear as a security guard and also voices Hulk (I saw this dubbed in Spanish so I didn't heard Lou) and Stan Lee has his obligated cameo in Brazil. Robert Downey Jr. is also here as Tony Starks, Avengers?Conclusion: Another enjoyable and entertaining film by Louis Leterrier. Another enjoyable and entertaining blockbuster and another fun Marvel world adaptation. Now let's see that Kung Fu panda.",8,2,3,20 June 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," The Revenge of....
","I never hear a thing about 'Lucky Number Slevin' until some weeks ago when i saw the DVD, this quickly gain my attention specially because of the great cast: Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, Ben Kinsley and Josh Harnett, and also because it was in offer so i buy the DVD. I didn't know what to expect because if Hollywood have teach us something is that 'big names' doesn't always mean 'great films'. Finally i saw this film last night and really love it.The plot is about Slevin (Harnett), who is confuse with his friend Nick Fisher who owes money to two of the most important crime bosses in NY: The Boss (Freeman) and the Rabbi (Kingsley), that also are big enemies. Now Slevin most deal with this two dangerous crime bosses.I really like the plot, is one of those that keeps you alert in all the film and have excellent characters. And of course, the excellent climax, that i'm not going to say, is really good and reminds me the film 'Oldboy', because you can't understand every little detail until the end.I really don't understand why a lot of persons put that this was very confused because in the end all the details are very well explained and also there are some flashback so for me it was very clear.About the cast: is just great, the two seniors (Freeman and Kingsley) are, like always, great. Harnett is becoming one of those actors who chose really good films and in this one is really good and Lucy Liu is an excellent actress and also very beautiful. But my favourite role is the one of Bruce Willis, excellent character for all that represent for Slevin and Willis is great.Conclusion: this film is not very know in Mexico and it wasn't successful in the box office but i think is just an excellent one so the people that works for 'Lucky Number Slevin' most be really happy with the result. And is one of the most enjoyable films of the year 2006.DVD: as i said, i buy this DVD in offer and i'm really happy about that.Just luck. Contain interviews with the cast and behind the scenes. Great like the film. PS: the Mexican title for this film is 'Asesino a Sueldo' that means 'Contract Killer'; i don't understand why.",Null,0,0,15 December 2007
Skyfall," There's a storm coming, Mr. Bond
","SKYFALL is the most memorable James Bond film from the Daniel Craig era. I watched other two films on the big screen too; I liked them a lot, but haven't revisit them ever since. I can't recall much about 'em. SKYFALL, on the other hand, is a movie so precise and, for a way to say it, minimalist in terms of plot issues that I will not have any problem to remember it in a near future. All of that precision only helps in order to have a 143 minutes picture that feels like an hour- and-a-half one. Nothing feels out of place and it's like if Sam Mendes and the team of writers watched Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT RISES and said something like 'We don't wanna do that with our Bond movie. We don't want plot twists or subplots. We just want a good and simple action picture'. I'm bringing Nolan's Batman to this commentary not just because the actual possibility that Nolan himself directs the next or a future Bond movie. It's because I thought SKYFALL feels at time like that version of Batman – a dark one, with a sort-of hopeless world. Coincidentally, SKYFALL opens with Bond going into exile, after apparently getting killed while doing a little mission. Bond is having a terrific time, with women and lots of drinks, while London, specifically M and the MI6, are going through hard times, with terrorism and death threats for the agents and M herself. There's a scene in which M tells a speech about the dark times they are living that especially feels out of a Batman movie from Nolan. Hell, there's a 'storm is coming' dialog too! Javier Bardem? Well, everyone is talking about the new enemy of Bond. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't recall much talking about the enemies from CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE. SKYFALL has indeed a good villain. You're actually waiting for him, waiting to see by yourself why Bardem's character Silva has been ranked as one of Bond's best ever enemies. He's like the monster in any good old monster movie – I mean, you're waiting to see him but he won't show up for some time. If anything, I will be eager to see the villain in the possible Bond movie of Nolan. Fact is that he (Nolan) perfectly knows how to create a memorable one and while I don't think Bardem will get an Oscar nomination (like Heath Ledger did with his Joker), he raised the bar pretty high. His hardcore fans, or any BIUTIFUL fan, may not agree with me, but for my money this is his third best and most memorable role ever, only behind his villain Anton Chigurh from NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (Joel Coen, 2007) and his hilarious one from PERDITA DURANGO (Alex de la Iglesia, 1997). Sam Mendes was only interested in creating a classic hero vs. villain movie. It's an obvious remark, as the last part of the film is literally that, but that's what I liked the most about SKYFALL. Think in Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION, that beautiful part with Bruce Willis choosing which weapon he will use to save that Marsellus Wallace character. He ends, as you can remember dear reader, picking up a classic katana, over a chainsaw. SKYFALL is a bit like that – Mendes and the writers could have had any kind of crazy location for the most important part of the film (the climax with the big, final confrontation between Craig and Bardem). The crew actually flew from London to Turkey and Shanghai, and they could have easily come up with something there. Instead, we have a setting as minimalist as just a house in the middle of nowhere in Scotland (although they filmed that part in England). Hell, we have old-fashioned shotguns as Bond's weapon! There's a reason to all of that Scotland thing for sure, a very nice one really, but what I'm just sayin' is that SKYFALL, with all the fancy and great cars and weapons, is still a movie that focuses more in elements like a good rivalry between its two main characters (Bond and Silva of course). And when it comes to showing some fancy cars and stuff, well, the results are bloody fun! Terrific stuff and, by the way, Adele's main theme is great – it's funny as I don't really like her music, and I love (almost) everything Chris Cornell and Jack White, but her song is way better! *Watched it on 20 November, 2012",9,2,9,25 November 2012
The Hangover," Our Doug ain't black
","Someone told me not that long ago that the 2003 film Old School was the f****** bomb. And Todd Phillips' Old School is moderately a winner for IMDb users, I saw it and damn, I liked better the other two comedies of its director Todd Phillips that I had seen (Starsky & Hutch and School for Scoundrels) which, by the way, are usually paned by IMDb users (not to mention by professional critics, especially Phillip's 2006 remake of a British 1960 picture). Now, this year Phillips came with The Hangover, it had its US theatrical release a couple of months ago, on 5 June 2009 to be exact, and boy is it a winner for users and professional critics (plus a great money maker), for everything I had to see The Hangover, last Friday finally arrived to my city and boy did I laughed a couple of days ago, last Sunday to be exact, at the theater. If you are one of those angry IMDb's top 250 buffs (I'm not a really big follower and I think the other times I have commented about the top 250 were when Nolan's Dark Knight reached the first position and when WALL*E had a place in the top 10) that are always like 'good film, but why is it part of the awesome top 250?' or like 'why this film is not in the top?' you may be wondering if this film deserves its place in the list of 250 best films for the users (right now it is the #191), I can say to those that who knows, who cares, The Hangover is a film that, in the way Old School didn't, lived up to all the praise and, like I already said, I really laughed with the time in Las Vegas of Phil (Bradley Cooper), Doug (Justin Bartha), Stu (Ed Helmskind of looks like McLovin) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis).And as is tradition these folks went to Las Vegas for Doug's bachelor party, for us is not really a problem the fact that we went to Las Vegas with our main characters and basically missed the party time, certainly not a problem since for us there's fun before and after the crazy party time but for our main characters (I add, Doug will get married with Alan's sister Tracy, played by Sasha Barrese, and Doug's best friends are Stu and Phil) is a problem but no they didn't went to Las Vegas and missed completely of the crazy fun time, actually and mostly just apparently they had a really f****** crazy night and that 'apparently' is actually the big problem since our characters simply do not remember a single thing the morning after the big Vegas night, not to mention that Doug ain't around. Of course the guy who may be not be as funny as the others (Bartha) is nowhere to be seen almost the entire film, it's a hangover only with the funny guys and certainly not the usual hangover. They, Stu, Phil and Alan, wake up not remembering a thing and just wondering why a tiger and a baby are in their suite and stuff, it's all a mystery, they must find Doug but pretty much every time there's a little peace after putting some pieces together a damn big crazy thing comes to make more f****** unbelievable their secret Vegas anecdote (sure they met Mike Tyson, and his tiger, but) and certainly more f****** funny! Heather Graham, Ken Jeong, Mike Tyson, Mike Epps, hell even when Bartha, the may not be as funny as the other main guys, returns or better said is found he is really hilarious!

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Some great mythology, forgettable action, and a weak main performer too
","This has one of the most attractive titles of the year – definitely a premise too cool to miss. Hell, I'm even tracking down the cheap, straight-to-DVD version of it (which is probably s***): ABRAHAM LINCOLN VS. ZOMBIES! Anyway, this is basically an all right flick in almost every aspect. It's not a straight vampire massacre as one could think it is thanks to its title. It takes itself seriously but not much. I ain't something that I intend to watch again; pretty but not very impressive. It's all right, period. In terms of mythology, it's mostly pretty damn great. It sort-of has the vibe that, I believe, DJANGO UNCHAINED will offer. I mean, this is certainly set in times of slavery, and we have our main character as a lone hero arriving to a town – western material, right? The combination of the American slavery issue and vampires turned out to be interesting and definitely worked – we have vampires buying slaves, and that thing seen as pretty much something good since keeps the rest of the American population safe from vampires. Yeah, that's terrific, interesting as hell mythology for my money. And visually, well, the film is really nice. This was actually my very first experience with the work of Timur Bekmambetov; but I do know who the guy is and, based on what I've heard, I'm sure that here he remained faithful, for better or worse, to his MATRIX-influenced style. Bekmamvetov's way of presenting the action is not something that gets me excited, to tell the truth. I didn't care for it but at the same time, I can't think in it as a big problem of the film (in other words, it doesn't annoys me). The performance of Benjamin Walker (as Abe) is definitely closer to be a problem. He's not bad, but never truly convinced me and couldn't deal once his part as young Abraham Lincoln ended. Not the best makeup work, though nothing as bad as the work done in Eastwood's J. EDGAR – Mary Elizabeth Winstead, for instance, is fine when she's doing Mary Todd in an older age. Was I the only one who recalled THE PROTECTOR (the Tony Jaa masterpiece of a martial arts movie) thanks to this? There's a whole sequence dealing with Abe and his main antagonist fighting in the middle of lots or wild horses running. And I recalled that mentioned Tony Jaa flick because Abe's antagonist grabs and throws a horse – in THE PROTECTOR they threw an elephant and that scene delivered an insanely fun moment; I still have it in my mind (just like the whole action of the movie) after 5 or so years of watching it. Will I remember in a near future something about the action (fights, vampire killings and that kind of thing) from ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER? I don't think so. So yes, this time I liked more the mythology and that's the main reason why I'm giving a decent rating. *Watched it on 08 September, 2012",7,2,5,9 September 2012
Training Day," That's all?
","Training Day is, as you already know, set in only one day in Los Angeles and is about a rooster (Ethan Hawke's character: the rookie cop Jake Hoyt) and a wolf (Denzel Washington's character: the experienced big narcotics detective Alonzo Harris). Is as simple as this: the film begins and is sort of having the experienced big detective who certainly knows how is that world opening the eyes of the rookie who just wants to track down big drug dealers, who just wants to do a good for the society. The transition we have is that Jake stops seeing Alonzo as the type of dude he has to learn a whole lot from to can deal with the new type of world he is entering and be successful and starts seeing Alonzo as nothing but a criminal that well tried to kill him, if at one point Jake smoked some weed because Alonzo said to him, in other things, that a good narcotics agent must know and love narcotics at one point Jake will go for his revenge. Saw bits of the making of documentary from the DVDincredible level of reality? Unforgettable minor characters? Not quite (the part with everybody turning their backs on Alonzo is like from a kids movie!); the acting of both Denzel and Ethan is good of course, pretty much their acting is the very best thing of the film, I mean I didn't found unforgettable and memorable characters in the ones played by Snoop Dog, Dr. Dree and well anybody else. It's a watchable film that once is over, well let's see, recently I bought the double feature DVD with both Training Day and Fallen (also with Denzel Washington and directed by Gregory Hoblit) just because I wanted to see again Antoine Fuqua's film again after many years (I remember seeing it when it was brand new as a rental). In that DVD Training Day is pretty much the main attraction and Fallen the bonus, minor feature (I never heard a thing before about Fallen), the Side A with 'Day' has much more extras and stuff. Now that I saw Fuqua's film pretty much Fallen has all the chances to become the only reason for me to say something like 'well, buying that DVD was a great choice' since basically by the end of Training Day I was like 'that's all?', certainly for me now Fallen has not a really good contender for being the best out of the two films on the DVD but I will see.",Null,0,1,1 September 2009
Kung Fu Panda," The Way of the Panda
","I love Kung Fu and of course martial arts movies, I like a lot pandas and I'm a fan of Jack Black's work so since I knew that Black was going to be a panda (great choice since Black looks like one of them) I have true desires to watch this picture and NOT since the hype before its release started in my country due to the comedian that dubbed Po. That comedian works for the biggest and most manipulative media company of Mexico so you can imagine all the f*cking publicity that they are making for Kung Fu Panda and all the hype for this mediocre comedian. Anyway, today after 1month of its release, in the Cannes Film Festival, was finally released in my country and yes I really liked it.There is a TV spot with the song Battle Without Honor or Humanity as background and that song is for most of us a direct reference to Tarantino's Kill Bill. That 2003 film was, as we all know, homage to the martial arts films and to some other genres. Kung Fu Panda works in the same line with a background full of the kung fu mythology and the look of the wuxia genre. The 'serious' characters are the furious five that are homage to some of the Chinese mart arts styles that based their movements in animal's movements. We have Master Tigress (Jolie), Master Crane (Cross), Master Mantis (Rogen), Master Viper (Liu) and Master Monkey (Chan). All of them are students of Shifu (Hoffman) whose master is Oogway (Duk Kim). The philosophy and the discipline are some of the values that these martial artists perform and I really liked this background. The enemy is also part of this but mostly part of the classic relation between master and student. Tai Lung (McShane) is the name of this snow leopard that use to be Shifu's best student but also they created a father-son relation. Of course he always has a 'dark side' and the master knows that and he was right. The master's philosophy make that a panda is the one, the Dragon Warrior. And our hero is the one who brings the laughs of course and the one that will change the things. The character itself is the classic one that is so useless for what he loves to do and Jack Black has made some very similar ones. 'Precious Father, why have you given me this desire to wrestle and then made me such a stinky warrior?' used to say Nacho from Nacho Libre and also JB from Tenacious D movie was similar in his dream of being a rock star. 'Precious Father, why have you given me this desire to be a kung fu master and then made me suck a fat panda?' yes that could be a perfect and funny line for Po (Black) that is a really funny character for obvious reasons. For a moment near the beginning the panda reminds a lot King Kong but the version of Homer Simpson and it was really funny as many cool dialogs, the fact that Po was hated by his own heroes or that scene when he fights for eat. The kids in today's audience were really enjoying the panda and it has a message in the end.The visual part is nothing new but that doesn't mean that is jut OK, actually is terrific and I really liked the first sequence made in 2D animation. I saw it with the Mexican dubbing and it is decent but vastly and sadly overrated. Anyway, I found this picture a really good one that easily I can watch again but now with the original voices so take your kids or your little bros and sis to the cinema to see and enjoy the way of the panda.",Null,1,2,20 June 2008
I'm Not There," How does it feel?
","As you all know six actors represent different roles that together represent a life. My first thoughts after watching it were in the way of how different is the film of what I was thinking before and that's the first fascinating thing about it. With the different styles you can see it as a sort of a compilation of short films that even could have been made by different directors but the narrative doesn't allow specially with the Dylan of Christian Bale. But all is absolutely and extremely enjoyable. The kid Dylan is a fake, a kid who speaks like an - experimented- adult, a 'blues kid' who has been changing a lot but maybe the only change that he felt was relevant was the subject of his blues. Of course we can relate this part with the 'final' part, the part with the Dylan of Richard Gere, who is just in a place that nobody knows. Is great how there is a subject (Bob Dylan) and upon that, of course, all the different stories are connected with the spirit but we can see them as individuals in their own 'world' with their own story and that feels really unique. A great thing is how really connected are the Dylan of Christian Bale and the Dylan of Heath Ledger. The second is an actor portraying the first one. You see in the first one the new sensation of folk music and you know more about him with present-days interviews, of course with people who knew him (Julianne Moore is here as Alice Fabian). You see the second one in his personal life more than in his professional life. Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is the woman of his life, his soul mate and the mother of his children. 'I Want You' is so great, so great. The Dylan of Blanchett is changing constantly and everybody around him is afraid of that. They want to have a secure concept, a unique concept of him. He can't give that. It is probably the most famous period, when the parties were for him as the Andy Warhol parties were for Morrison. The 'Ballad of a Thin Man' moment is perfect, just perfect as the rest of the songs in each moment of the film. Dylan's lyrics are all.It is not relevant, I never knew that well the name Heath Ledger when he was alive. I watched 'The Patriot' yet I don't remember him in it. I know the acclaimed 'Brokeback Mountain' yet I haven't watched it. I have just seen him as the joker, now as Robbie, he made two magnificent performances. Is not relevant also, the first film that I saw with Bale was from 2005 and since then I never saw another with him until this year with the sequel, later in American Psycho and now here. Charlotte Gainsbourg is also amazingly powerful as the unique woman who made a real connection with Dylan in the film. Cate Blanchett is really Dylan and that's impressive and she is my favourite although the entire cast is simply superb.Then this is a fascinating film and it deserves to be watched at least more than a single time. On that way the DVD has 2 discs so in consequence really interesting material, from the usual rare footage, the director commentary and the galleries to a lot of information about Bob Dylan. Probably the most interesting material is the compilation of different conversations with the director Todd Haynes together with the 20 minutes documentary about the music of the film but still I haven't watch all the bonus material. Also it includes a little homage to Heath Ledger and the six actors making their own 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' video - probably my favourite extra footage. In short it is a really complete DVD.Finally, 'I'm Not There' is something different, a film that must be enjoyed not only by fans of Bob Dylan but by music lovers and of course cinema lovers. Surprisingly or better ridiculously some people were considering 'Juno', and some others, for best film of 2007 and even a certain -extremely- famous critic give 'Juno' that place. This one is my personal choice. I love it, I love it yes I love it so bad.",10,0,0,6 August 2008
Wayne's World," I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day!
","Directed by Penelope Spheeris because she works before in films about rock music, 'Wayne's World' is that, a total funny and very original entertainment with rock music as a style for two memorable characters. The film is about two very good friends: Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey); they host a local cable-access show called Wayne's World made in Wayne's basement and they are very populars with local people. When Benjamin Caine (Rob Lowe), a TV executive, buy the show Wayne and Garth must deal with the differences between their little show where they can do everything and their new big show where they are exploited.The script of this film was based upon the characters created by Mike Myers for the show Saturday Night Live and for me the characters of Wayne and Garth are nothing but memorable just like all the original scenes of the film like the sponsor's commercials, the scenes with the camera following the characters, the scene with Jimi Hendrix's song 'Foxy Lady' and the different endings including a great spoof of Scooby-Doo.The cast: is really funny with Mike Myers in one of his first films and still one of his most memorable works. Dana Carvey is just the perfect partner of Myers and is really funny too. The cast also include the lovely Tia Carrere as Cassandra, her most known role and the cameo of Alice Cooper as himself, according to the film, a very boring rock star.And as i said the music of the film is terrific, including songs of great bands like Queen (Bohemian Rhapsody), The Jimi Hendrix Experience (Fire and Foxy Lady), Soundgarden (Loud Love), Red Hot Chili Peppers (Sikamikanico), Temple of the Dog (All Night Thing) and some other great songs.Conclusion: this is an excellent comedy with two great characters and with a very original style, always with rock music in the heart. 9 out of 10DVD: i recently get this DVD in a very low price and is excellent too. Contains interviews with the cast and crew, comments by the director, trailers and a very original menu.",9,0,1,13 February 2008
The Big Lebowski," IN THE TOP 3 OF THE COEN BROTHERS............I'm the dude Man
","The BIg Lebowski is maybe my favorite film of the Coen brothers ( the others are O Brother Were Art Thou? and Raising Arizona.....also Fargo) because is one of the greatest American comedies ever made. For me The comedies of the Coen brothers are much better than the thrillers like Simple Blood or MIller's Crossing and in the Big Lebowski they create a very funny role that was excellent plays by Jeff Bridges. The story is kind of simple: a man is confused by other man that has the same name and he is in a big trouble. But whats makes great this films is the actors and the funny touch of the directors.... Jonh Goodman and Steve Buscemi are just excellent, also Phillip Seymor Hoffman in a little role is excellent and other fact that i love in this film is that Flea from the RHCP has a participation (very little) in the film and i love the music of the RHCP. About the funniest dialogs and scenes in the film: well there are a lot but i love the scene when Walter put his gun in Somkey's head and other of Walter in when he gets angry because of the Shomer Shabbos. Of The Dude, they are a lot but i love when he says his versions of the kidnapping to The big Lebowski and also when he crash in his car. Donny...well Donny is funny in all his scenes and dialogs but when he says Lennon about Lennin is just great. All this parts of the film are great but the best is when Walter throws the bottle to the air with the rest of Donny. Other great character is Jesus and Jonh Turturro is excellent..............let me tell you something pendejo (his best dialog).",10,0,1,27 March 2007
Inglourious Basterds," 'I must say, damn good stuff, Sir.' and probably Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction
","Roger Ebert, after seeing Inglourious Basterds at the Cannes Film Festival back in this year's May, pointed out the originality of Tarantino's latest picture. He mentioned certain elements of the movie and pointed out that he didn't recall another war movie with those certain elements ('Inglorious Basterds is, I believe, the only war movie with its climactic scene set in a movie theater. The only war movie with a critical last-minute confrontation in the projection booth. The only war movie with a lecture on the fire hazard of nitrate film stock. The only one that pays much attention to the names of such great directors as Pabst and Clouzot'), of course in reference to the fact that Quentin always takes stuff from other movies and has many critics because of that fact ('Quentin Tarantino is sometimes criticized for including too many references, some say whole scenes from other movies in his own work'). Of course I'm not like Ebert (I can't even write pretty well in English! Hell, I'm certainly more like Aldo the Apache, the basterd played by Brad Pitt, pretending to speak Italian!), I have seen few war movies but still I can add that to see Adolf Hitler asking to his men for a bubble gum you will have to check out Inglourious Basterds!But of course there's more, there's more that make of this a really magnificent fun time at the movies. It's a 153 minutes movie but believe me it feels like a 90 minutes one. It moves fast sometimes (mostly thanks to the basterds, the group of American soldiers that have been terrorizing the Nazis) but it is a movie with 'slow' scenes but it's a movie without a second of boredom, it's a movie where the 'slow' scenes grabs you and make time pass as fast as possible. Divided in 5 chapters Tarantino's movie isn't like Enzo G. Castellari's one from 1978 (Quel maledetto treno blindato, better known as The Inglorious Bastards). Here we have a clear mission for everybody in the not-Nazi side and all the pieces will get together in order to have a German night in Paris, a night for the latest piece of Nazi propaganda, a precious chance to end with the war. I will bring QT's previous picture, his half of Grindhouse Death Proof, to this comment and no I'm not one of those many that hated Death Proof, actually I loved it but definitely there's only one really cool character to remember (well maybe two thanks to the amazing Zoë Bell). Boy, Inglourious Basterds has lots of truly memorable characters, of course the acting is brilliant, of course is just fascinating to watch all of these characters.",10,1,8,10 October 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," 'but then I just carried on living my life'
","This Apatow 2008 production is the first big Jason Segel film project, who the f*** is Jason Segel? Well, if you're like me you just know him for his role in Knocked Up as one of the gang of funny dudes. I guess Seth Rogen could have been just about right here playing the main role (the character that is 'forgetting Sarah Marshall') but this is Segel's film, he wrote it, he 'took' Rogen's 'place' and damn he had a great time, I mean Kristen Bell and MILA KUNIS!I really loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall and frankly I wasn't expecting anything less. Saying that Segel took Rogen's place can mean that here Segel's character, Peter Bretter, is the one with really funny friends, you know Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader are here but actually here is not like in the 40 Year Old Virgin or Knocked Up since here there is not a group of friends, it's basically Peter alone going to Hawaii after hearing from his girlfriend of 5 years, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), that she found someone else. Peter is a musician, currently composing the music for the show in which Sarah stars, so basically and at first sight Peter is simply the victim of a TV star whore, yeah at first sight Sarah is nothing better than that. So we go to Hawaii with our main character, trying to change the bad time he was having in LA yet some few minutes in the Hawaiian hotel and we see Peter and Sarah face to face, Peter meets Sarah's new boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), Hawaii will be basically a crying all time type of vacation for Peter. However from the moment he realized that Sarah was also in Hawaii a woman have been acting really, really nice with him, a perfect woman (played by Kunis) and of course it will be just matter of time foryou know, and while Peter and Rachel, Kunis' character certainly, start to hang out, have a good time together the relation of Sarah and Snow starts to go down. Was expected then now, and with the cancellation of the Sarah's show Crime Scene, things are not going to be fine for the, still for us, whore that leaved out main character and I say 'still' because at this point when Sarah begins to miss Peter of course we are like, well before I write anything I better add that we find out, at the same time that Peter, that Snow slept with Sarah for a year, she cheated our character a whole year! So yeah, poor Peterbut, and is a big but, then we hear Sarah and damn she speaks to Peter in a great way, he was just a f****** stupid and certainly for us was since always the victim. But of course the past is just the past and here our character will be act like an idiot again, now for some moments forgetting Rachel, he will ruin things, and that means it's time for Dracula, time for puppets!Segel basically did whatever he wanted, we have him flashing, singing his Dracula songs, the results are hilarious. And back with the three supportive funny dudes, well Bill Hader, who plays Peter's stepbrother, is quite funny doing team with Liz Cackowski (and getting all f****** excited while singing the Dracula musical!), Paul Rudd delivers some good laughs but he is almost not worthy to mention, on the contrary Jonah Hill is, like always, being himself and delivering fantastic hilarious moments (also worthy to mention the fun with Jack McBrayer. Poor dude, now that's suffering, and later on enjoying, a honeymoon!). But really the characters of Rudd and Hill make a nice friendship with Peter (his real Hawaiian pals are two very funny big dudes. For one of them Peter is like Gandhi but even better! Isn't that friendship?), Rudd's is a surfer who suffers a bit of amnesia (drugs are bad, mmmkayy?) and Hill's character is basically in love with Aldous Snow (loved basically all the jokes with these two). And, for me, Russell Brand steals the film'I hate your music' 'well, I f**** the housekeeper'.",9,1,4,8 August 2009
The Impossible," Comforting, but brutal too
","Two weeks ago my girlfriend and I went to the movies and decided to watch two movies instead of the usual one; we didn't think much in our double-feature, I mean in the selection which certainly needs always to be featuring two similar films but not for the obvious reasons (like for instance just because both were directed by the same dude, as Tarantino once remarked), but we just based our selection in the show times: FLIGHT at 17:00 hrs. and THE IMPOSSIBLE at 19:30 hrs. We knew both were not feel-good experiences, but the similarities we found between them were more than we expected and luckily the double-feature was just damn right, with those magic movie moments – going out from a film that shows and is based upon an air crash to enter to one that begins with a sequence inside of a plane (not to mention that only a couple of a weeks ago I had enter a plane for the first time in years!). FLIGHT (Robert Zemecki's comeback from 'motion capture') and THE IMPOSSIBLE (Juan Antonio Bayona's first feature since 2007's EL ORFANATO) are about the consequences of, respectively, an air crash and a natural disaster. The structure in both is quite similar and none takes much time to show us the disaster (the big, important sequence we all know exists and therefore are waiting); in fact, both do it in a not very different way and at the moment of the impact (of both the plane with the surface and the tsunami) everything gets confused, the lose sound, certainly they are trying to put us in the victims' perspective. Both films bring us hard and sad issues during almost the whole time to end in an optimistic note (the characters that suffered find some light). 'Classic Hollywood style' you might be thinking, and yes, both are comforting for the average viewer (especially THE IMPOSSIBLE) but at the same time never forget that their subject is a tragic one – in FLIGHT the main character doesn't have the best ending (even if he finally finds some peace) and in THE IMPOSSIBLE the horror of the 2004 tsunami is always well exposed. The great Terry Gilliam once criticized Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, saying that 'they save those few people, happy ending but that's not what the holocaust is about, it was about complete failure of civilization to allow 6 million people to die'. Also, Gilliam compared the Spielbergs of this world with the Kubricks (it was Kubrick actually who first said that 'SCHINDLER'S LIST is about success and the holocaust was about failure'); the first ones give you answers ('even if the answers are stupid') and comfort the audience, while the second ones leave you always intrigued, make you think and provoke ideas and discussions. When you make a film about a human tragedy, namely the holocaust or one natural like the 2004 tsunami (which caused the death of approximately 280,000 persons), you're taking some important risks. When you decide to place a story about hope in any of those tragic scenarios, well, you're taking even more risks. THE IMPOSSIBLE begins with the words 'based on a true story', and in fact this is remarked when the screen only shows 'true story'. Juan Antonio Bayona had to do that for obvious reasons, as the main story of his film is the one that comes for every 10 thousand tragedies of the tsunami. Some images are simply brutal (a truck full of dead bodies, for instance). THE IMPOSSIBLE could be thought as a movie with a completely different horror to the one of EL ORFANATO – a graphic horror, which requires a daring work especially from its main actress Naomi Watts. And Watts is indeed daring, great and leaves no doubts why she got nominated for the Academy Award. It would be easy to 'destroy' THE IMPOSSIBLE as Gilliam did with SCHINDLER'S LIST, because and as I already said, Bayona's film turns to be comforting, with a climax that's totally a 'movie thing' (even when it's based on facts), and since it constantly shows the good side of things (the protagonists helping other victims and vice versa). However, Bayona perfectly understands what this tragedy is all about – yes, the protagonists' ending is a happy one, yet in the same scene we can see the other people that weren't as lucky still suffering the consequences. For this I would say that in this film Bayona has aspects of both, the Spielbergs but also of the Kubricks of this world. *Watched it on 08 February, 2013",7,0,1,23 February 2013
Hostel," In a way disappointing but in general aspects good
","'Hostel' came to Mexico in 2005 whit a lot of expectations because Quentin Tarantino presents the film and also because a lot of people who already see this film said that this film was the most disturbing film ever. Finally the certification in Mexico was D, just for adults; it was the first not porno film that have this certification in Mexico so i couldn't see this film in the cinema. Well first, for me this film wasn't the most violent ever and in consequence is not so disturbing as the publicity said, and of course i think that the certification was excessive. In that way i feel really disappointed when i watch 'Hostel' in DVD for the first time. I mean, 'Hostel' is as disturbing as the mainstream could be and even the most disturbing photo that appears in some posters and later in the DVD cover (the man with a drill in his mouth) doesn't appear in the film.But that doesn't mean that i don't like this film, for me is very entertaining and in general aspects is good and could be better without the excessive publicity. The plot is simple but good, two young Americans and another from Iceland are on vacation in Europe, first in Amsterdam where they only want to have girls and later in Slovakia because a guy told to them that in an hostel in that city they could find the most beautiful girls in Europe. In Slovakia they are part of a business for sick people that want to kill a person. The Americans are the most expensive so the girls of the hostel help to put the Americans in that business. There are like three chapters in the film; first Amsterdam where is only parties and fun and looks as a teenage film, later Slovakia where also is some fun whit the girls but the fear and the bad feelings start to affect the character's mind and the film start getting good and finally in the factory where there's only pain.I like the idea of Eli Roth to put this kind of original business in a film: you pay for kill a person and the prices are different according to the nationality of the person. I read once in a newspaper that the story was based on a true story of a place that Eli Roth finds in internet where yo pay for shot a unknown person. I mean that is truly scary, to know that places like this really exist.Well the cast is just good, mostly young actors and the makeup and the visual part of the film is really well done. Also i love the cameo of Takashi Miike, even he can't speak English, he accept to participate with Eli Roth who is a fan of 'Ichi the Killer'.Conclusion: thanks to an excessive publicity 'Hostel' was disappointing but anyway i don't recommend this film to sensitive audiences. And for me the film is good, very entertaining and worth a look. 8.5 out of 10DVD: great, whit a lot of comments by Eli Roth, Quentin Tarantino, producers and the cast. Also whit a documentary of the make of Hostel and three different angles for the scene when the crazy children's destroy the car.",8,1,3,20 October 2007
Happy Gilmore," Hockey Player?
","Golf is pathetic and I wouldn't like to watch a film about it yet Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) thinks in a similar way so we are going to have some fun. He is a so-called ice hockey player but he can hit golf balls as nobody and he needs a lot of money for a good cause (his grandma) so why not joining a professional golf tour. You know when a professional football player or any player of a decent sport is asked about their beginnings they always mention things like ' you know I love to play it since I was a kid in my neighbourhood with all my friends' and stuff but when a golfer is asked is like 'well my family owned a country club so' and stuff so for obvious reasons golf is for me extremely boring and the golfer himself or herself is pathetic. So imagine when Gilmore enters in the golf world, he is the punk rocker of golf, doesn't dress with Lacoste but with AC/DC t-shirts, uses for caddy a vagrant and is the only one followed by the masses, the new working class hero and since it doesn't really matters if he doesn't win, since there is always a big check, he is going to have some fun. The tag-line of the film is 'He doesn't play golf... he destroys it' and I really appreciate that but of course he will not be the punk rocker of golf all the time since he has to win the money for his grandma and eventually he will learn how to really play golf with the help of Chubbs (Carl Weathers), a character with some terrific moments. The weakest part of the film is the ending because reminds you that this is not that special and that you can know what is going to happen in films but by that I have already laughed in many scenes and I think you will have too.I like Sandler but I'm not his biggest fan yet of course I do have enjoyed some of his films so after reading many positive things about 'Happy Gilmore' and founding its DVD very cheap (mostly for this) I'm here writing that I enjoyed it but it doesn't stand up from the rest of Adam Sandler films that I have seen but at the same time it is an excellent choice if you are looking for an entertaining and light comedy with a memorable cameo of Bob Barker (as himself) and a hilarious cameo of Ben Stiller! (as a true bastard).",Null,1,2,13 July 2008
The Rocker," 211 songs? 'Wow, that's like 500 albums'
","There's a scene in Peter Cattaneo's THE ROCKER in which the main character (Rainn Wilson's sort of version of 'rocker Jack Black', Robert Fishman aka Fish) correctly puts the, as he call it, 'drive test' as a true indicator if a song does or does not work. I mean, who doesn't love to drive with a badass tune playing in the car? Who doesn't love to drive to some great The Doors album? Or to some killer Motörhead tunes and feel, like Fish says, 'on top of the world'? Here Fish is out there driving together with one of his band-mates (Teddy Geiger's character Curtis). They will test a song Curtis wrote. For them the song does work, does rock, and does make you feel like you're sitting on top of the world. But if a movie with as a title like THE ROCKER says that a song like the one Curtis wrote totally rocks, something is pretty darn wrong. Nobody who truly loves rock music will drive to that song and f****** rock! Probably in every single review of this movie we have a comparison with Richard Linklater's THE SCHOOL OF ROCK. If you still wonder why, well I just say to you that Wilson's character is a frustrated rocker who now will find a new chance with a band of kids. Hell, it actually begins in the EXACT same way (with the main character being kicked out of a band) and ends in the well enough with the spoilers. To finish my 'drive test' point, here a real problem is that the kids don't rock (they are not really *kids* though, but adolescents). The music is closer to the Jonas Brothers than to The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Cream, AC/DC, or any of the other great rock bands that THE SCHOOL OF ROCK paid homage to. And certainly that homage thing was one of the reasons why that 2003 Linklater movie was a real blast. Yes, there's only one true rocker here, and Wilson as Fish really is good, darn good fun (just read again Fish's dialog I put as the summary!), but in the end he just can't help the *just plain unmemorable* rest of the movie. Also, in the end everyone sort of forgot that Fish was a real rocker, you know, he *has* to be around a so-so cast of kids, damn Jane Lynch playing the un-cool serious character (his husband was funny, though), enough said. A mixed bag, the kid of thing that makes you say, in the most convinced way, the 'I will not watch this again'.",Null,0,1,14 August 2011
Public Enemies," 'We're here for the bank's money, not yours'
","When Michael Mann's new film Public Enemies (and first since the 2006 Miami Vice) became part of my 'must-wanted' films for this year I never imagine that the day it opened in theaters of my city I was going to be thinking about the fact that it was shot in digital, sort of 'worried' about the look of the film. Certainly during the past few days I read some criticism towards the look of this film and because of being sort of 'worried' I came to give a quick look to a wikipedia list of films shot in digital and for example by seeing films like Steven Soderbergh's Che Part One in the list I was like 'I don't remember even noticing the digital cinematography'. Maybe was just because this time with this film I was alert, I was ready to judge the digital thing and sure I was but I do think I would have noticed how 'home made'-like Public Enemies looks at times if I would have went to the theater without reading any single comment of it. So now I can say, after seeing it yesterday on the big screen, that honestly yes, this doesn't looks like a big, period piece, production with an inspired Johnny Depp and an inspired Marion Cotillard should look but in the end, did the digital cinematography ruined Mann's Public Enemies for your humble commenter? No, simply no. John Dillinger in this film can be resume with one scene: he's on the thing he does, which is of course robbing banks, when an old man gives to him his own money to avoid any possible and dangerous situation, certainly the man is afraid (how could not?) but in a way Dillinger 'calms' the old man since he's there just for the bank's money and not for his or for hurting him. These actions are the ones that make obvious that a man like Dillinger will not be comfortable while working with a man like Baby Face Nelson (played in this film by the great Stephen Graham, who shined in Snatch and in This Is England), these actions are the ones that put an audience in the side of the criminals. And frankly Christian Bale, who is Melvin Purvis, 'helps' since there's not much to remember about his character, actually is not Bale's fault (he is good) but is the big 'Dillinger vs. Purvis' thing that doesn't delivers as I was expecting, it feels that Purvis is just another of the bunch of good guys and certainly I was expecting something much more memorable out of the Dillinger vs. Purvis stuff. So the audience is with Dillinger, there's enough material of both Dillinger's skills and intelligence and charisma and of the federals and just police's incompetent. Some of what we have here are a couple of bank robs, a couple of breakouts, an intense shoot-out in the woods with the feds against Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson and company (this sequence was horribly affected by the digital cinematography), the difficult times for Dillinger, the love story of Dillinger and Evelyn Frechette (Marion Cotillard is superb) and the final moments of Dillinger. And is the final part of the film the one I found as the best and is mostly just for a magnificent and tense part with Marion Cotillard shining (is classic stuff, 'Billie' resisting the brutality of a fed that for sure earns the total dislike of the audience, certainly is the typical situation of an interrogation but also is an incompetent fed relieving his anger against a woman who points how easy he fooled them, how Dillinger was there and they were stupid enough to leave him, it's a great part), a truly awesome part with Dillinger asking about the ball game toÂ…well for once I won't spoil you and a good if not great final part at the Biograph Theater. This is a good, solid if not completely fascinating work by Michael Mann with a great performance by Depp that yet is for me far to be one of his finest. This could have been so much better and certainly not only technically, so yes the digital cinematography didn't ruined for me Public Enemies, it's not something that can't stop me in recommending it and I do recommend it but it's just not one that goes immediately to my list of favourite crime films",Null,2,3,4 July 2009
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Viva la Resistance
","South Park was and is not an extremely popular show in my country, it is popular but of course and obviously not as The Simpsons, and obvious that is because it will never air on National TV. I don't really remember in what year exactly this movie was premiered in my country, not on theaters but only on cable TV as a PPV movie but by that year I was already a really big fan of the show and by that year it wasn't already part of the regular programs of MTV so the movie was and still is not popular here. I remember that the first time I saw this movie I was taping it and eventually that VHS became one of my favourites but it's been a long time since I haven't watch this movie and also I stop watching regularly the show after Season 6 (released in my country in 2003 I think) and since then I have just bought the Greatest Hits Vol.1 DVD and I have seen just some episodes on MTV but not long time ago I knew about the fact that now all the episodes are available on the official website for free! So recently I saw a couple of the new episodes and I found them hilarious so I have been listening, for the very first time, some of the mini commentaries of Trey and Matt from the DVDs, in short 're-discovering' South Park. Now it was time to finally watch again SP: Bigger, Longer & Uncut after so many years and right now I'm glad I have just did it but I'm more than glad that it is still that film that I loved!!!It begins in the classic way of making references to Cinema itself, not only with the boys (Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny) going to watch the first feature film of their favourite TV show (Terrance & Phillip), which is R-Rated, but also and quickly putting Cinema as 'where we learn everything that we know' so what does the boys will learn by watching, lots of times, the 180 minutes Canadian masterwork of comedy 'Asses of Fire'? Well everything that was previously censored!It is a clever film and until now they have made similar things, for example in that episode with Family Guy, and in this case we are watching in the film a not surreal reaction of the parents if we think in the reaction of the parents if their kids starts talking like Cartman but it is the South Park movie and they make more bizarre stuff than those pair of Canadians. And later it plays as a great satire of war but they just don't care that and that's why it gets better.As for the boys, basically the four are together (yet Kenny in hell) fighting for the same cause but of course not for the same reasons (Stan must find the clitoris also!) but that doesn't really matters since these kids are clever enough to know that they are living a f*cked up situation. As for secondary characters, there aren't many difficulties in order to remember a memorable moment for most of the regulars support characters of the show and since South Park is the place where problem with T & P and the apocalypse began and since it's a 'quiet' town everybody has a part. Basically Kyle's mom is the nemesis in the story and we can understand why Cartman hates that bitch. The mothers are of course the ones that are relevant in the story and everyone else has just little moments but as I write those are just memorable, for example Ike hiding alone (stay for the scene after the credits also) and Chef leading the Human Shield squad with that crazy but hilarious general who killed Bill Gates! Sound bizarre and it's really bizarre!Of course the first feature film of a great show has to contain some 'special' things ('Asses of Fire' has some great musical numbers and for god sakes it is a 180 minutes film!!!) and apart of being uncut we have many great special effects, Kenny's face (voice of Mike Judge!!), Saddam Hussein (in the great style of those guys) and many great and hilarious musical numbers. Trey Parker has said that 'This Is Spinal Tap' is the reason of why he make movie musicals and definitely this is one of my favourites musicals of all time, simply because the songs fits perfect and all of them are extremely hilarious (who can forget Uncle F**ka).To recommend Trey and Matt stuff is still not that easy and it could be simply like 'if you love the show you will love this movie' and that's truth yet if somebody who wants to start with South Park this is great way to and if you love it then you will check the show and if you don't well at least you have seen South Park at its finest.DVD Extras: only 3 trailers which are all just great but still it is just a good presentation of the film.",10,1,1,1 August 2008
Ted," One of the funniest from 2012; 'Flash Gordon' fans rejoice!
","'Larry Charles' 'THE DICTATOR' is the best comedy of the year; and nothing comes close, really'. That I wrote back in early September 2012, before watching TED of course (and MOONRISE KINGDOM). Recently I had to do my top 12 of 2012 for an online magazine I began collaborating in – I didn't include Seth McFarlane's first feature film but when I recalled its fantastic and hilarious homage to the FLASH GORDON movie from the eighties I realized it deserved a place. This is the best thing McFarlane has created; basically with this movie he lived the dream of every geeky fanboy: to work with his heroes and make tons of references to his favorite movies, like STAR WARS. Obviously he has been doing that for many years with his series (if you have seen enough FAMILY GUY you'll recall some of its scenes with this flick), but nothing is as cool as doing it for the big screen. Nothing as cool as ending your romantic comedy in the pure style of an action adventure that features Indiana Jones! Some people will think TED is a sort-of excessive proof of the power that MacFarlane has in the industry; having Norah Jones herself for the musical climax is perhaps as excessive as random (yes, MacFarlane did everything he wanted to). TED ain't a perfect film but, and like I indicated, few others from 2012 were as funny. Its story is the very same of any romantic flick: the man (Marky Mark) loses his girl (Mila Kunis) but soon gains her back. The key here is that the reason why Marky loses his girlfriend involves, surprise surprise, Flash Gordon himself! And certainly the title character, the teddy bear with life Ted (voice of McFarlane himself, aka Peter Griffin) turns to be the classic crazy- irreverent-hilarious bastard. I would love to hear the opinion of filmmakers like Edgar Wright and Guillermo del Toro, since both are huge fans of FLASH GORDON; but I'm pretty sure TED made them very happy and they weren't like 'hey! I would have done a better homage to Flash'. *Watched it on 11 September, 2012",9,1,4,1 January 2013
Oldboy," Oldboy is a masterpiece
","Oldboy was the first film that i have seen of the director Chanwook Park and for me this one of the best films of this decade.The film is about a man that is kidnapped and after 15 years is finally out. He has now money, a cellphone and other stuffs but he want to know the reason of his kidnapped and have a revenge. But what he don't know is that this 15 years was the revenge against him.This plot is one of my favourite stories ever and the way Chanwook Park make the film, with an intense beginning and a violent and amazing end is nothing but great.Of course a film like this is not for all audiences but i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves Asian films and loves Quentin Tarantino's films because Oldboy won fame at the Cannes Film Festival and also distribution in all the world because Tarantino gave Oldboy the grand prize of the jury. I don't care if it won prize but i know that if Oldboy doesn't be in Cannes maybe in Mexico this film wasn't in DVD region 4So in few words: Oldboy is a modern masterpiece and for me is one of my favourite films of this decade.",10,23,44,22 May 2007
Pirate Radio," 'And then for a couple days after that'; An AMAZING soundtrack indeed, and overall a quite good and quite memorable film set during the best years of British rock
","Quentin Tarantino once said that 'if you use the right song in the right scene it is about as cinematic a thing as you can do, you're really doing what movies do better than any other art form... the effect is you can never really hear that song again without kind of thinking about that image from the movie... when Dirty Dancing used 'Be My Baby' it's like, that is the opening theme to Mean Streets excuse me. Whenever I hear 'Be My Baby' I see Harvey Keitel lining back on his pillow'. 's The Boat that Rocked is certainly full of truly amazing tunes, after all this is a period piece set in the 60s about a pirate radio based on a boat (and its DJs and its detractors) that gave to its incredible large audience not just 45 or so minutes of rock and pop music like the BBC but well just about 24 hour per day of the best British rock and pop. While I wouldn't go as far as to say that from now on whenever I hear tunes like the Kinks' 'All Day and All of the Night', the Who's 'Won't Get Fooled Again' and the Rolling Stone's 'Let's Spend the Night Together' I will see the respective image from The Boat that Rocked I must say that those scenes are pretty darn memorable, pretty darn good, hell, maybe yes, maybe whenever I hear 'Let's Spend the Night Together' from now on I will see that image from this movie, that truly memorable and totally satisfying scene in which rock truly wins. What we have in The Boat that Rocked, I mean the main plot is quite simple as we just have the British government trying to find something to can make the pirate radio of our main characters (Radio Rock is its name) illegal (to be exact we have – as the boss of 's character) and on the other hand we have our main characters acting according to the circumstances of having the government nearer and nearer. But of course the 135 minutes (yes, at first I was surprised by the runtime but believe me, it feels like it is a 90 minutes film. Nevertheless in the US is was cut to 116 minutes and re-titled as Pirate Radio) are not only about the persecution but also and mainly about all those weird adventures that happen on the boat. Basically each and every one of the DJs and the rest of the crew ( plays Carl who is the newcomer and in a way our main character) is memorable and of course that's why this film feels like a 90 minutes one when it is really a quite long comedy. We have from a sort of rock star () to passing through a dude who didn't know that Jesus was the son of God and that (yes you will not have to wonder why he is tick ) and an old hippie who would risk his life to save his LPs! Phillip Seymour Hoffman, the fat friend of Simon Pegg in both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and play the main Significance with all of those scenes with the followers Maybe those 'trying to be iconic' moments doesn't always work (like the going to the pub and the club sequence. Those scenes showing the followers of Radio Rock are sometimes just about fine but other times are just too much. Oh and the homage to the original cover of Jimi Hendrix's brilliant masterpiece Electric Ladyland was really nice and quite funny) but nevertheless minor things like those don't 'ruin' this film, it's a truly fun time with the sounds of the Rolling Stones, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Who, the Moody Blues (yet another film with the beautiful 'Nights in White Satin'. Actually was the third time I heard it in a film during this year since I also saw A Bronx Tale and Rob Zombie's Halloween II), the Kinks, the Yardbirds Tommy James & the Schondells, the Beach Boys, the Box Tops, Ennio Morricone...",9,3,5,16 November 2009

Superbad," 'McLovin in the f*cking house!'
","According to the release dates listed on this site, 'Superbad', aka 'Supercool' in my country, was released in October 2007 in my country then in that October I didn't know what to really expect from a new release of the Apatow Company since then I haven't already watched 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', 'Anchorman', etc. But also I always felt desires to check specially this one yet I never went to see it on the big screen and once my cousin said to me that it was not that cool as everyone was saying together with the fact that later I saw 'Juno' (also with Cera) and later 'Drillbit Taylor' (also from Apatow Company) were enough things to lose most of those desires to watch 'Superbad'. Now I think about a month ago I finally saw 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and that's a great and hilarious comedy so it was kind of 'I understand that the stoner of this film is the writer of 'Superbad' and that sometime ago I had desires to watch it so what the hell'. Right now I'm not disappointed because I laughed, and a lot in some parts, but here in IMDb we can read many commentaries praising the film in an excessive way so I'm afraid that it is not that cool, let's say that it is just cool. As, for mention one, 'Dazed and Confused' this film is about only one day, focusing more on the night of that day that seems to be the last chance for 3 boys to lose their virginity before college. So is just about how the writers can make the most possible situations in order to make a longer, tired and surreal day for the 3 boys. In that the really funny character McLovin (Chris Mintz-Plasse) and the two cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen) are the funniest thing of the film and practically at a point those three are the 'soul' of the film. In the other hand or better in other part of the town we have the 'adventure' of the two main characters. One of the two is an extremely annoying guy who is talking s*** all the time and who used to draw pictures of man d**ks at the age of 8! The other main character has his first appearance in a film to later meet a girl named Juno in his second. This two have some hilarious dialogs in their daily conversations (the Coen brothers don't direct porn!!!) but as soon as they left McLovin everything turns to be less funny so at a point is like 'forget those guys and let's have some fun by watching McLovin and his new and hilarious pals'. After they meet again with badass McLovin everything is like the conventional teenagers picture, having problems with the alcohol and with the girls after a fight between the two to finally end the night both really drunk and confessing their love to, by he morning, be friends again. Maybe was the only possible way to end this film since and as Seth Rogen claims on the DVD documentary, 'our filthy brand of humour has become mainstream' or something like that. Conclusion: I do recommend this film if you are looking for a funny entertainment. It is not the near masterpiece of comedy that some persons are claiming on this site but those who are claiming that it is a film only for stupid persons well simply go f*ck yourselves. Anyway check this picture because and after all McLovin in the f*cking house!",10,4,9,30 July 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," So predictable, so boring this one just SUCKS!
","I'm not familiarized at all with the universe of the X-Men, never read a comic book, never watched the cartoons and I haven't seen any of the films complete (I have seen parts of Bryan Singer's X-Men and Brett Ratner's X-Men: The Last Stand). I went last Monday to the movie theater to see this one, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, yet I still can say I have seen at least one of the X-Men films complete since I slept while seeing this one on the big screen. Pretty much I saw ¾ of this film, enough to can say I'm totally agreed with Roger Ebert and with everyone else who hated it. So predictable (for instance, everyone can see coming since miles away that Victor will come to help his brother Wolverine, not to mention the whole stuff with Wolverine's girl Kayla), so boring, so lamethis one just f****** sucks! Stay away!",Null,0,2,1 July 2009
Hot Fuzz," Hot Fuzz is one of my favorites films of this year
","My cousin invite me to watch Shaun of the dead like 2 years ago, here in Mexico that film became a cult one because it wasn't very commercial and because was excellent.Now this Friday Hot Fuzz was release in the cinemas of Mexico City and also the director Edgar Wright came to Mexico. Now whit the little help of QT & RR and also Guillermo Del Toro, this film have more attention than Shaun....I saw this film this afternoon whit an empty cinema, just my cousin,and 3 or 4 people more so i think Hot Fuzz is going to be out of cinemas this very same week and is going to be a cult film. It's a shame because this film is more than excellent but well at least i can watch it on the cinema.Now about the film: Is about Nicholas Angel, who is the best cop in London so he is transfered to the 'best town in England',Sandford. He is going to see how different is the town of London and later start to investigate a series of murderers that for the people of Sandford are just 'accidents'.Amazing humor, just like in Shaun of dead,also whit Nick Frost one again as Simon Pegg's friend. And is like the same type of town and like the same bar (winchester and the pub). Whit a lot of movies references (oh i love the film collection of Danny , is just amazing) so thats why a lot of people think that this a parody of action films but Edgar Wright said that this was more like a tribute.As a conclusion: this film is just excellent,for me is one of my favorites of 2007. Contains a lot of fun dialogs and fun scenes whit the same style of Shaun of the dead and also the edition and the cast is great. So Edgar Wright whit this two films, the fake trailer in Grindhouse and whit Simon Pegg is one of my new favorite directors.Finally is want the DVD for extra material and also because must be in my collection.",10,0,1,22 October 2007
Rise of the Guardians," One of the best animated movies of the year for sure
","First we had classic monsters together (HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA); later video game characters (WRECK-IT RALPH); and finally this, with classic folklore characters that the kids believe in. 2012 was like the year for doing a crossover in animation (hell, not only in animation since we had THE AVENGERS too!) and RISE OF THE GUARDIANS is definitely the best one, therefore one of the very best animated pictures of the year; alongside FRANKENWEENIE, BRAVE and PARANORMAN. Part of the success, I think, comes directly from having really good characters. The key character of the story is Jack Frost (voice of Chris Pine) – we learn everything about him and his background (why he became Jack Frost) is so great you just want to learn everything about the rest of the characters. All of them, as you already know, are traditional characters that most people, especially in Europe and the United States, know since their childhood; we have Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, Sandman, the Easter Bunny and the already mentioned Jack Frost (as well as the bogeyman). The film deals with the thing of being a kid that still believes in those characters. Who can't relate to that? Yes, I'm from Mexico and as a kid didn't give a damn for Santa but I did for the equivalent (los Reyes Magos) – the believing thing is universal and is really well used here and definitely brings freshness to the same old story of 'evil threatening the world and heroes saving it'. It's a soulful fantasy for kids that will get 'em in the most emotive mood for Christmas. *Watched it on 01 December, 2012",9,3,6,8 December 2012
My Neighbor Totoro," となりのトトロ: A wonderful gem about/for the family
","As for many others, I guess, Spirited Away was my introduction to the work of Hayao Miyazaki and as many others, I loved that picture when I saw it on theaters back in the year 2003. Now thanks to my cousin I have seen My Neighbor Totoro on DVD and I can say that is just another gem of Miyazaki.Is a simple but wonderful story about family and the rural Japan is the place for this story. You will be always kind of worry about the two main characters of the story: Satsuki and Mei, two sisters of 10 and 5 years old respectively. Their mother must be at the hospital so they must stay only with their father Tatsuo who works at the University. All of this makes that the girls stay a lot of time alone in a place where getting lost seems very easy but they take care of each other as good sisters. Of course Miyazaki immense imagination is here, of course to help this little girls and when Totoro appears is just fun. I really love this amazing character; sort of a big rabbit that seems always to be very lazy but the magic is here and with the Catbus (another product of Miyazaki's trip) they become soon the adoration and the helpers of the sisters. Is a family movie so is always present the feel of being worried about a family member (the absence of the mother of course but there are many scenes where you can find that feel, for example when it's raining in the bus stop in what probably is my favourite scene) but also that feel of being helped by the people near to you (in this case the people of the village were very kind and really helpful), never loosing the hopes.Conclusion: If you ask me about the animation, I have few words to say: is a piece of work. And if you ask me about the dubbing, well I watched the version of Spain and it's pretty good but I do have desires to watch the film with the original language. Anyway, My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful gem for the whole family (I actually saw this with two of my cousins and with my grandma and the four of us loved the film) and personally after watching my second Miyazaki film I do have a lot of desires to check his entire work. Keep on smoking Hayao!",Null,0,1,1 June 2008
Juno," A 'Ghost World' for the masses
","Juno (Ellen Page), a 16 years old girl,is pregnant and she doesn't know what to do, first she thinks in an abortion but she doesn't feel completely happy with that. Finally she decide to give the baby to a couple who has been trying to have a baby for long time, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Jason Bateman).The plot is this film is really simple but works perfect for this enjoyable film that right now is really popular due the Oscar nomination for best film. First i want to say that don't have a big interest in the Oscars and i don't believe in all of their opinions of which film is the best of the year but it's a fact that i always enjoy watching the show and making my predictions to win some money with friends and family. I like the fact that the Academy in the past years suddenly put their look into some little and great productions like 'Sideways', 'Lost in Translation' and the last year in 'Little Miss Sunshine' but i don't like the fact that in consequence of that attention the 'indie' companies suddenly start to repeat the formula and the result is a film like this one that is enjoyable but it's a rip off all the past little films like 'Napoleon Dynamite' or 'Ghost World' but in a light version that can be in the theaters all around the world and ready for the nominations. The film contains somehow the style of 'Ghost World' featuring a young but very intelligent girl who seems to be really disappointed with the world , the films of Jared Hess with all those great colors that we can watch too in other great director like Wes Anderson but in the end 'Juno' is a very light comedy, nothing new and with the typical happy end that left everybody satisfied.The cast is good but for me the performance of Ellen Page is really overrated by critics. The supporting cast is nothing special with Jennifer Garner and Michael Cera.Conclsion: 'Juno' is a good entertainment with some good things like the talks about films and music and it's true that there are some great dialogs but for me is nothing new. And i don't like the character of Juno, she wants to be like Enid (Tora Birch in 'Ghost World) but Enid wasn't that stupid to get pregnant at the age of 16. 7 out of 10",7,2,8,17 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The best of the trilogy???
","I think that the trilogy of Pirates of the Caribean is such a nice comedy but also is a very spectacular trilogy in all the ways.I'm not going to put a resume of this film because is a third part and most of people know by now the main story.Well, i have to say that Johnny Depp is maybe the best actor in our time (i talking in the 90's and the 00's) and here plays his most important and most know role, i have to say that it isn't his best role but is excellent.Jack Sparrow is the best character of a pirate in the history and i hope that sometime we can see him in another film, maybe the adventures of Jack Sparrow like Johnny Depp says in a interview.But also captain Barbosa, Davi Jones (excellent character) and all the others characters are great.......except William Turner (Orlando Bloom), he is good in the first one but here he became a character less important. And well Keyra is just beautiful and also she's an excellent actress.Is this film the best of the trilogy??? for me maybe, because i also love the first one but this is very close.As a Conclusion: if your are not yet a fan of this films well i hope you can watch it since the first one and enjoy it like i did.",10,4,7,27 May 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," The Sons of Hellboy: A Clockwork Army
","With that title, The Sons of Hellboy, maybe I'm giving some spoilers but also a possible title for the next picture of Hellboy, you know if some old man wanted to call Jackass 2 'The Son of Jackass', why not that title for our red hero. Anyway, The Golden Army is a good title but by far a better army but of course not good for us, the humans. 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' begins with an old story about a battle in which The Golden Army was the protagonist that soon became a legend. A very young and very funny Hellboy is been amaze by this 'legend' (in the unique scene/flashback with the great John Hurt as the Professor Trevor Bruttenholm) of course not even imagine that he will be the only hope for the humans when this ancient battle treat to be repeated. Meanwhile Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) is making all the necessary to can awake again The Golden Army we have similar situations of the first film with the secret team (soon will be no secret), I mean with Hellboy (Ron Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abraham Sapien (Doug Jones). Those similar situations will take them to the chaos occasioned by Prince Nuada and the action begins with small but very dangerous creatures. As I write, the secret team will be no longer secret, courtesy of our Hellboy, and a truly great character will be introduced, I'm talking of the new boss of Hellboy Johann Krauss (voice of Seth McFarlane, creator of Family Guy!) and soon all the fantasy will be here. We will see a new world and many many great creatures in it; when I saw that scene in the Troll Market it reminds me the very famous bar from Star Wars, of course the music was missing. Anyway, as the film goes Hellboy and pals will be the only hope to stop the Prince Nuada but of course it won't be easy thanks to Nuada's twin sister, Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) but don't get me wrong, she is with our heroes yet if Hellboy hits Nuada Hellboy hits Nuala (funny names) and if that sounds bad, you should know that Abraham Sapien loves Nuala! So the film also plays with love and also with the way that Hellboy is starting to see the humans. We always are so damn stupid so we can't realize that Hellboy is the good guy ('believe it or not, he's the good guy' is the tag-line) and we can't appreciate our only hope who he is helping us in a battle that has nothing related with him but damn who can blame us since our hero is a f*cking demon with bad humor and the Beast of the Apocalypse! Anyway the only thing that really matters is that Liz believes that he is the best man so we can't be worry, Hellboy will fight against that mentioned army of gold and the results are very good! Is more than excellent that Blair, Jones, Hurt but specially that Ron Perlman are here again but Rupert Evans' character is not any more here and that worked very well because even that Myers was the key in the ending of the first film this time he would not have been really useful against The Golden Army so better a team with read, blue, Liz and Johann. Talking about this new character, I didn't know that Seth MacFarlane made his voice, which is kind of cool, but unfortunately there are few screenings with subtitles in my city but fortunately Guillermo del Toro supervised all the dubbing and I founded it really good (the voice of Abraham Sapien is quite similar) and also I founded surprising that the -annoying- Jesus Ochoa dubbed Hellboy and later even more surprising that he actually made a good job.Then like the first Hellboy film, this is extremely enjoyable, fast paced and definitely I would like to watch it again. I liked it more than the first one; now we have truly amazing creatures, the clockwork army and a better 'mission' for read and blue. My only possible complaint about the first one was that after the fantastic mythology of the character we have those evil persons back and stuff but during the film Sammael is the only real opponent of Hellboy and almost until the end is when the rest of the gang appears to fight with red. So actually I think this is a superior film since it has a legendary battle that involves humans but practically only as the victims and that works perfect in the times when Hellboy is becoming a very well known hero but also we are loosing him. But again he, and now also Abraham Sapien, has someone to fight for and also to drink for (hilarious part with some Tecates and some romantic music). Finally, I'm more than glad that Guillermo del Toro is having a great way from project to project and I'm glad he made this sequel and that he will make The Hobbit and the possible third Hellboy film. So can't wait to see more and believe me, I'm going to finally get some Hellboy comic books!!!",10,2,6,11 July 2008
Cloverfield," It's eating people
","When a group of friends are at the goodbye party of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) some strange creature attacks the city of New York. The film show to us the experiences of the friends dealing with this unknown creature.This all the plot of this film and certainly is not the best thing of the film. But the way the film is made with the style of an amateur tape and the hand held camera is great and the visual part is just perfect. To talk about the monster is unnecessary because is still a mystery and is going to be very useful to create a franchise in a very near future. But still i think it missed something with the monster because i don't like the love story that is behind the main plot, i know that they are trying to make us feel something about the characters but for me the love history is not even credible.The cast of the film is good, with new actors making a nice job but still nothing special and again the visual part is more important and in consequence is the best thing.And i haven't watch a marketing for a film like this one in the last years, create almost a cult for the film before it release. I wasn't very excited about the film but i was expecting the revival of the monster film and for me in this film is missing something.Conclusion: judging by the reaction of yesterday's audience, the result was really strange because most of the people didn't feel that the film has an end and some people was like in shock but most was really dissatisfied. I didn't feel any of those feelings and i think that is what is missing, i mean to feel really disappointed or to be in shock and confused about it. Anyway for me is a decent film but of course is not the best sci-fi/monster of the last years but still have some really interesting things. Worth watching it in the cinemas for the perfect visual part, well only before the release of 'No Country for Old Men' and 'There Will Be Blood' in my country. 7 out of 10",7,1,3,5 February 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Bandidos Yanquis
","George Roy Hill's extremely famous 1969 film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (with Paul Newman as Butch and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid), wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It ain't a really great western or one of the best films of its year overrated is the word but also one more: entertaining. 'Butch and Sundance' is a really fast-paced Best Picture nominee (it was also the 1969 top grossing film in the US, by the way) with good if not extremely likable two main characters. I must say that in the end I liked the film (plus I was very glad to finally see it, of course considering it is considered a true classic) but: a) I will not watch it again (probably never again), and b) I really, really hated some parts of it. Let's see, the runtime marks almost 30 minutes and pretty much I was like 'so far everything is really good': cool introductions to our main guys, in sepia, great fun with Butch and his replacement as the leader of the gang ('Harvey thought of that?'), the first success with the Flyer and the ladies. The film disappoints in the same way Butch and Sundance would disappoint some of their admirers. I will try to explain this: like I just said the first minutes of the film are just about fine since basically we are all right with the legends. Certainly is the fact that, for instance, the legendary Sundance doesn't know how to swim what may cause to those that are even sort of glad when they are being robbed by the legends some laughs. We don't really mind since of course the legend is a thing and the reality is another thing but we do mind when the film goes in a direction that is like a 'f*** you' to the tone of most of the film. And that different direction sometimes works in Bolivia but the bicycle scene with Butch and Etta (this young woman that is played by Katherine Ross and that is the love of the Sundance Kid but that also has a very close relation with Butch) is, well and you may like the song, that's another thing (I first heard it on the soundtrack of Forrest Gump and I do like it, it's not a favourite but it's kind of nice) but anyway, soon after the surprising bicycle riding moment we have again our western with the legends being tested, with the legends worried. And Bolivia is sort of strange, pretty much it works since when it's a comedy I laughed (even sometimes legends like Butch and the Sundance Kid could not even let the respective people know they were committing a robbery!) and it works having the beginning of the legend of the bandidos Yanquis (again an annoying music part though). It's fun but also I'm a bit disappointednevertheless a truly magnificent ending!",Null,0,0,12 September 2009
Snatch," Highly re-watchable! One of my favorites for sure
","This is a time when to see the name Guy Ritchie is no longer exciting for me, at all. I wasn't the biggest fan of his ROCKnROLLA, and neither I was of his version of Sherlock Holmes. Hell, all the great interest I had towards Ritchie some years ago is all gone now. SHERLOCK HOLMES 2 for this New Year's Eve weekend? I'd rather watch the awesome THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN for the third time instead! So, I'm a fan of just the two first Ritchie films. I have seen SNATCH countless times, on VHS, DVD and now finally on Blu-Ray (I think the first time was back in 2003). Actually I watched it on Blu-Ray almost two weeks ago, when I wanted to share this great movie experience with my girlfriend and realized I just had it on the now completely obsolete (at least in my house) VHS format. I also realized it had been years since I watched it for the last time, so certainly it was the right time to bought it on Blu-Ray and watch it again. I was actually exciting to do it, and was not disappointed. It's still the movie I love.The quality of the Blu-Ray image ain't the best. It doesn't look as clear as some others, and maybe this is an indication that the movie won't age too well in terms of its style. But I don't really know, and the main thing here is that SNATCH is truly great stuff. As fast-paced as not many, Ritchie's second feature offers a performance that is as superb as underrated. I'm talking about Brad Pitt's one. Obviously Pitt is as acclaimed as he really deserves, and his bodywork, which even includes now a work with Terrence Malick, is something anyone will admire in the future. For me his performance in SNATCH, as a crazy as f*** gypsy, is one of his very best and one of the best things about this movie in general. I can't imagine myself recommending this movie without saying something about Pitt's awesome performance. The way he talks is the key thing certainly, and that talent was later reprised in his role in Tarantino's -Ritchie's 'rival director'- 2009 masterpiece INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and in Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE. So, Pitt alone makes this one worth to watch. What happened to Jason Statham also? I mean, I was also a huge fan and even watched some minor movies (like CRANK, CHAOS and THE BANK JOB) just because of him. Damn, right now I don't even know by name the stuff he has been in recently. It happened the same as with Ritchie: all of those movies with Statham are, if entertaining, completely forgettable, so my interest went away! I'm not even a real fan of his Transporter movies so I also stay with his two first ones. Here he ain't the action hero, but a fairly normal and clever boxing promoter dealing with all the dirt that surrounds the world of illegal sport. And he's name is just Turkish, so is all pretty darn cool. The great partnership he has with his friend Tommy is not the only one of the movie. We have from some of the worst and fattest -and most hilarious- criminals ever to some of the toughest and craziest! All too damn memorable to go for the details so you better check out this fantastic movie and have a fun blast!",10,0,2,31 December 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Mexico and Spain!!!! hell yes!!
","Guillermo del Toro is without a doubt the best Mexican film maker ever and El Laberinto del Fauno is his masterpiece. Great in all the ways: act,direct,photography,visual effects,make up and the best part, the amazing history that is just a magic trip. Set in Spain because Del Toro says that the Spanish history is more simple than Mexican history, this film tell us the story of Ofelia, a little girl who is going to see how cruel and sad is the real world but how incredible and magic is her innocence and her love to fantasy tales. I don't want to say nothing about the plot so finally you must see this film that is maybe the best of 2006, that is Del Toro's masterpiece and THE BEST Mexican FILM EVER.PS: About the DVD, is just OK the Region 4 DVD so is terrible that the Region 1 DVD is better than the region 4 (just the cover is awesome)because this is a Mexican film and it deserves a better presentation for all the fans.",10,5,11,22 September 2007
Knocked Up," 'She don't care what her mama said, no. She's gonna have my baby'
","For Alison Scott (extremely beautiful Katherine Heigl) everything should have been just party and more party after she got a dreamed promotion in her work at E!. For Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) everything should have been just party and more party yet without any girl just with his cool friends (Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Jason Segel and Martin Starr), , all together having the usual routine. They had fun together but what's the only way to watch these two making love? Well you know, it was a crazy night for both so in the next morning we have again these two as the two total different persons that they are from each other; obviously Alison is the 'affected' one and the one who is going to be cruel. So what's the only way to make that Alison needs to see Ben again? The title of the movie says everything. 'Knocked Up' was for me the last movie to watch of the Apatow 'family'releases from 2007. And yes they are like a family so here everybody is quite known so in that way basically everybody is kind of making a role that they had already made, basically is like they were not even acting, specially Jonah Hill. Again Seth Rogen and his 'brother' Jonah Hill 'command' the gang that will deliver hilarious stuff, those are a bunch of cool friends from Canada, stoners and hard-workers. The main problem is that basically their work doesn't give them any money since their website is cumming soon but soon the other problem will be related with the fact that their cummming soon website is nothing new. On the other side we have a family that have it all but is full of distrust. I understand why Katherine Heigl is pointed this film as sexist, she said that the film 'paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys'. Sure but it is just a movie and not because the sister of Alison (played by Leslie Mann) is not a very likable character (yes she is a bitch!) every woman is like her obviously. Here you will be a hundred percent on the side of Pete (Paul Rudd) -he was out just to play fantasy baseball!- who will be basically Ben's friend to turn this at a point in the men vs. women kind of stuff (going to Cirque du Soleil with mushrooms is not a good idea!). Anyway, this is a funny movie; it makes that our Big Lebowski-like character changes from being a simple lazy stoner to be a productive guy. After all he was a f****** lucky guy, yes he was very lucky! For me happens with this movie the same that with 'Superbad', both are not the masterpieces of comedy that many were and are claiming but both are very enjoyable movies that I do recommend and that I do liked a lot. With 'Knocked Up' happens also that it has been pointed for having pro-life themes just like 'Juno'. If you are wondering I'm pro-choice and these are just movies and both have their characters in a situation and with specific circumstances. Obviously that doesn't need and are not to be seen as if they were true. Anyway, I think that between 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', 'Superbad', 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' and 'Knocked Up' my least favourite is this one but obviously that doesn't mean that it was a sort of disappointment, finally it is as entertaining, enjoyable and funny as I was expecting. These movies are those kind of movies that, with the 'pretext' of showing them to your girlfriend, family, etc., are very easy to enjoy more than just a single time. That's very nice. Oh and if you were wondering, for an odd reason, about my title, well that's a line of a Kings of Leon song that shares title with this movie.",9,0,2,26 August 2008
The Doors," Riders on the storm
","As a fan of the Doors i really enjoy and love this film. Maybe is not so real but i think it has more positive points than negative. I love the fact that the actors really learn to play the instruments and also some of the performances. Val Kilmer is not Morrison but still in some parts of the film he really look like Jim. My favorite film of Oliver Stone and my favorite rock film.Finally well i'm very exciting because in less than 4 hours i'm going to see Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger as the Riders on the Storm here in Mexico City so maybe is going to be the best concert in my life.DVD: it's amazing, the cover is just great and the bonus disc whit delete scenes and some documentary's is great.",10,2,3,2 October 2007
Life of Pi," Maybe not an instant favorite, but it sure is gorgeous
","I didn't pay a ticket to see this film just because Ang Lee directed it. This was, in fact, only my second experience with his work – I'm still not interested at all in his HULK or in 'Brokeback', and I'm waiting to get the Criterion version of THE ICE STORM. Anyway, I went for this since it looked great in the trailer and well, it's just one of those that gets literally universal acclaim – not just the likes of Roger Ebert are praising it, and even the good people of FANGORIA magazine called it 'gorgeous' ('I urge anyone who loves the magic of pure cinema to see it in 3D' – Chris Alexander, Fangoria editor). LIFE OF PI is one of those movies where the story is not only being told to us (the audience) – the protagonist Pi (played by four different Indian actors, each one for a different stage of his life) is actually telling his story to a writer for the potential writing of a book. Pi's life story must be, therefore, an amazing one, or else what the hell is doing a writer in Pi's house in Canada, right? There's a moment in the film when Pi says to the writer something like 'you must be wondering when we finally get to the incredible part of my story, the part about survival'; certainly we can think that Pi is saying that to us too – in specific to the part of the audience that got to see the trailer with the tiger and the boat and the incredible visuals. LIFE OF PI is, basically, two different films in one; very different from each other I must add. In the first part the 3D format is ultimately useless, but don't get me wrong, waiting for the main show isn't something painful. The writer might be bored or just not completely amazed with the first part of Pi's story, but I'm sure you'll be totally entertained, laugh and find some truly memorable things. Irrfan Khan plays adult Pi; this actor had also a part in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (Danny Boyle, 2008), which is the film that I think shares the most with the first part (and well 'Slumdog' also has that 'protagonist telling his story to someone else' element). Certainly this part take us to India (the French India to be exact), and is as simple as this: if you enjoyed the childhood memories of the protagonist of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, and I'm sure you did, I can't think in a reason why you wouldn't like seeing, for instance, the origin of Pi's name (which is just too funny to reveal here) and some other of his childhood and teenage experiences (dealing with issues like religion and the first love). The main question dealing with this film you might have is the following: 'how did a young man ended in the middle of the sea, in a lifeboat together with a tiger?' The second part of the film opens with the kind of spectacular-full-of-CGI sequence that Steven Spielberg or James Cameron could have directed, if that makes sense. But soon, and as you know, everything will get minimalistic. It's, indeed, quite a show, a gorgeous one. Some shots are definitely among the most beautiful ones captured on camera this year. The CGI work done with the animals is simply perfect (talking about animals, don't miss the nice title sequence!). Simply put: when you create a whole lot of emotions with only a young man and a tiger, you're definitely doing some great things. When this part was over I felt everything else that followed to be unimportant. LIFE OF PI tries to create an interesting take on how stories are told; it tries to make you doubt and think again in everything. Nevertheless nothing is as soulful or interesting as Pi's final encounter with the tiger that stayed with him for more than 200 days in a lifeboat. I watched on the big screen 'Slumdog', really liked it, but until this day I haven't felt the need to revisit it. I think this same thing will happen with LIFE OF PI; but certainly you should check it out. *Watched it on 29 December, 2012",8,0,1,31 December 2012
The Godfather: Part II," Robert De Niro is great
","And that part is the only part that i really love about this film. I'm a big fan of Mario Puzo's novel and The Godfather is my favorite film of all times but i was very disappointed about this film. I mean if you make a perfect film, won 3 Oscars,became a success director ,why do you have the need to create a new history and make another film. Coppola could be one of my all time favorite director because of the Godfather,Apocalypse Now,The Conversation and Rumble Fish but whit this film, jack and of course The Godfather part III he disappointed me very much. I wish he only do 1 film of the Godfather trilogy, the one that contains all the parts of the novel and maybe this could be the perfect film.This film is a little boring because now you don't have Brando and now you don't have the essence of the novel, now is like more of the same whit out the charisma of Sonny and whit Pacino more mature and more boring. I don't say that this is a bad film because Robert De Niro always save the day (I really love the part of young Vito) but what i don't like is the fact that Coppola wants to make more films from a perfect beginning so 7.6/10.And please don't watch the Godfather III.",8,0,3,23 September 2007
Burn After Reading," The Coens' funniest film? Only if 'The Big Lebowski', 'Raising Arizona' and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' were never made
","It's been almost two months since 'Burn After Reading' was released in the Venice Film Festival (27 August 2008 according to IMDb) but just yesterday 24 October 2008 was finally released in mi city. So this year I watched two Coen Brothers pictures on the big screen, with the first one I was agree with anyone who loved it, certainly 'No Country for Old Men' is in my top 3 of 2007. 'Burn After Reading' has mixed comments in IMDb and as for today of the 211 comments in total, 94 are from people who loved it and 107 from people who hated it. I had big expectations and I really wanted to be one of the people who loved the film, hell I love 'The Big Lebowski', 'Raising Arizona' and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' well actually I love most of the Coen Brothers pictures but I didn't loved 'Burn After Reading', I don't hated it either but for sure I was expecting more.The cast is full of stars, I found mostly annoying Clooney but he is amazing in my favourite Coen Brothers film. Malkovich is certainly good but his character complement the character of Swinton to make an annoying couple. Then Pitt enters and we have the best part of the entire film. His character is just fun and he will have a partner. McDormand's character is just like Pitt's and is fun however her story is sad, basically we have two kind of persons: the 'smart' ones and the stupid ones. The 'smart' and powerful ones f*cked Osbourne Cox (Malkovich) who is also one of the 'smart' ones. Then you have his wife who is f*cking him and who will f*ck him really well. Clooney is Harry Pfarrer who practically f*cks everything. So we have Pitt and McDormand's characters, Chad Feldheimer and Linda Litzke, who apparently have a simple routine, a fine job and enough 'innocence' to make us laugh. I really like Pitt's character, he is just fun and Linda could have been just that but her sad story and the sad story of Ted Treffon (Richard Jenkins). Linda wants to have a new face and a new body and she is f*cking Harry Pfarrer. For me one of the best moments is the action of taking the information to the Russians. Chad Feldheimer and Linda Litzke never knew a sh*t, they just knew that they could blackmail Cox, they knew they had some CIA sh*t so they bring the sh*t to the Russians! And when Pitt is killed all we have are the 'smart' ones with power. Hey and J. Jonah Jameson, he is quite funny.So 'What did we learn?' Well, that those persons who claims that 'Burn After Reading' is the funniest Coen Brothers film since 'The Big Lebowski' are just lying. Also I felt in a similar way that when I watched 'The Ladykillers', then I felt that the film was nothing special but right now I kind of want to watch it again so maybe a couple of years later if not more I will want to watch again 'Burn After Reading'. Hell, I have already, and finally, 'The Hudsucker Proxy' on DVD, just hoping it is as great as 'The Big Lebowski', 'Raising Arizona' and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' (just considering the comedies of the Coens).",Null,0,3,25 October 2008
Watchmen," Dawn of the Superhero
","This is an ironic story, once a brilliant scientist had his own sort of typical superhero story, certainly unexpected, certainly his life changed completely and then it was the dawn of the superhero, 'God exist and is American'. And yes Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) was born in America and after his life changed completely he was known as Dr. Manhattan, of course his name help you to remember that he is an American. Now is 1985, a nuclear holocaust is right on the corner, really big tension between the US and the Soviet Union. At one point cities are completely destroyed, the president of the United States, Richard Nixon, will get a surprise: the attack was not caused by the Soviet Union, it was caused by Dr. Manhattan, yes the same who was the key for the US to win in Vietnam, the same who still was there working with the US Government. But after all he does saved the world from the nuclear war, now is a time of 'peace and love', is all over, the destruction brought peace. So is sort of ironic that the 'American God' Dr. Manhattan destroyed New York City (and other big cities of the world) and also that destruction brought the end to a conflict that was near to become a nuclear war but that Dr. Manhattan caused the destruction is only the official version, is certainly what almost all the people think is the truth, only few know that is not the truth.In the first month of this year I saw another movie based on a recognized comic book, I saw Frank Miller's The Spirit in January and in my IMDb comment of it I wrote that even that even that I never read something from Will Eisner I was interested in seeing The Spirit, basically was the same thing with Zack Snyder's Watchmen certainly since I never read something from Alan Moore but still I was really interested in seeing Watchmen. Also in my IMDb comment of The Spirit I mentioned the Zack Snyder film 300 that, as you know, was based on the Fran Miller graphic novel. While Miller went to make his debut as director or better while Miller lost his mind and directed a big piece of s*** Snyder went to work on a project based on the work of an artist who, unlike Miller, will not even consider to watch the final product (Moore is not even credited as writer of the graphic novel). And unlike Miller and his The Spirit Snyder ended with a much superior work than the $uccessful 300.Anyway, Watchmen begins in 1985 and, like I wrote, a nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union is very near. Superheroes are outlawed so basically when the Comedian (great performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed there's only one of his old partners that is there still with a mask, one who certainly known that the Comedian couldn't die in a simple robbery. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Hurley is also great) is our man, he still wears his 'face' and we trust him as the vigilante that knows that there's something behind the death of the Comedian. So soon after he found that the Comedian was killed he will go with his old pals, including Daniel Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson), who was Nite Owl II, and Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman), who was Silk Spectre II. Our story in 1985 is pretty much the great Rorschach trying to find more who is behind the death of the Comedian and Daniel having the worry and fear like many other people because of the times but certainly knowing that he can act (and also having an opportunity to become a dream in real, certainly I'm talking about the opportunity he has to be more than just friends with Laurie).",9,0,2,11 March 2009
The Thing," Paranoid Winter
","Since the very beginning we all realize that is going to be a long and difficult winter for all the men of the research station in Antarctica. Besides the fact that must be really frustrating to be working in a station like that without your family and women, the winter looks even more difficult in part because now they can't make a communication with anybody so practically nobody will hear their screams. That cold and lonely environment is perfect for the story of this film, story of paranoia, human behaviour and unknown things. That aspect of the unknown things is brilliant, first everything starts with an unusual situation: a Norwegian helicopter is pursuing a Siberian husky, trying to kill it. Not knowing why that Norwegian went crazy shooting everywhere, the men of the station kill him and the dog stays there. And since then they start to investigate, first to know more about the Norwegian station and later to know more about a thing that was defrost. Of course thanks to their science skills they obtain great information about what was really the dog and how that thing is able to imitate other life forms. Now the paranoia begins with everybody trying to survive and not trusting in anybody. Here the best part of the film begins with that thing that could be anybody. Of course every team has a leader, here is RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) who is the helicopter pilot and definitely the smartest and the only who still can think about a possible solution, also realizing that the thing is trying to survive just like them. The last part is just great with the 'still humans' knowing that they are not going to survive but with the hope that they can take with them the thing. In the end the only thing they can do is to wait there for a little whilesee what happens.'The Thing' was the first studio film made by Carpenter but it was released just after 'E.T.' back in 1982 and was a theatrical failure but definitely is a terrific film with many great visual scenes; of course the ones when the thing appears are my favourites. The cast is also pretty good with Russell in his best days, just after his escape from New York and now with more hair and beard ala Morrison. The rest of the team is good too and is odd that there aren't women in the entire cast.Conclusion: 'The Thing' is just another great film of John Carpenter that gained more audience with the video, laser-disc and DVD releases. In these days when in America there is nothing but remakes of the classics, remakes of Asian films, prequels & sequels, mixes between two films and stuff, is almost a fact that another remake of a Carpenter film is coming. Now this film is probably going to be remade and if the thing will be just like in the past years, after seeing the remake where are going to re-watch this 1982 version just to take off the bad taste in our mouths. It's true that this film is also a remake but in this case is more faithful to the original story and is just great.Region 4 DVD: Although the box doesn't say this is the single-disc collector's edition of 'The Thing'. It contains many bonus materials: the really interesting and informative 80 minutes documentary 'John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape' (the only problem with this documentary is that it doesn't contain Spanish subtitles), the classic director commentary also with Kurt Russell, Production Background with the description of settings and characters, photos of the cast, Production Art and Storyboards (great concept sketches), Location Design, Production Archives, Outtakes and two scenes(frame by frame and full motion), Post Production (cool photos of the premier and posters), Production Notes, Cast and Filmmakers, Theatrical trailer. THAT'S A DVD!",9,6,9,30 April 2008
Trouble with the Curve," Average movie; watch instead 'Gran Torino' or 'Moneyball'!
","This is one of those Hollywood dramas where every single problem, and believe me there are quite a few, gets solved literally during the last 10 minutes. TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE is basically three things: a Clint Eastwood picture about aging and parenthood problems; a bland romantic thing that involves Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake; and a movie about baseball. Let's write about Clint first. In that recent directors talk from the Hollywood Reporter, which had Tarantino, Ang Lee, Affleck, Van Sant, D. O. Russell and Tom Hooper, there was an interesting discussion about aging. Tarantino said that filmmaking is a young man's game and that when a director 'loses it' is mostly due to aging; later he remarked that Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris was his favorite 2011 film, after D. O. Russell brought Woody Allen to the aging discussion - it was really great stuff with a variety of points of view. The case of Clint is quite strange for me. Aging was becoming a great thing for him; in a period of 5 years (2003-2008) he made only solid films, and he was already in his seventies. And now, only 4 years after GRAN TORINO (a personal favorite), he is out there, without a recent great film, bitching against Barack Obama and coming back from acting retirement for an average movie he didn't even direct. The curious thing is that he came back from retirement to do the same role that we, or at least I thought was going to be his last. Here we have an angry old man who lost his wife and has problems with his daughter (played by Amy Adams) - sounds exactly like Walt from GRAN TORINO, right? I believe by now I have given too many words to Clint; after all this is a performance that will be soon forgotten - a main role that feels like a minor, unnecessary one, if that makes sense. Now, let's bring the romantic side of the picture. Adams and Timberlake finally getting together inside a lake in the middle of the night? Silly stuff, I know. The curious thing is that both are huge baseball connoisseurs, so Adams' character it's like the dream girl for the baseball nerd. Speaking of the quintessential American sport, well, it's simply impossible not to think in the infinitely superior MONEYBALL while watching this. Clint's character Gus is the kind of scout that Brad Pitt would have fired - an old school scout who couldn't care less for the technology that now is part of the game. It's average stuff too and I believe a baseball fan won't find much here, aside of some dialog that refers to players and games - it's a pretty boring baseball movie, where nothing happens until the ending (and it's material that's too obvious to really care for). So yeah, don't waste your time with this and watch instead GRAN TORINO or MONEYBALL! *Watched it on 16 December, 2012",5,2,4,16 December 2012
American Psycho," Psycho Groupie Cocaine Crazy
","I have just crossed with this DVD; for me American Psycho was one of those films that you know about its existence and you know that probably will be for your taste but you never watch it. Of course now I'm glad I finally watched this film. Anyway, it has a character that goes to an extreme and that deliver amusing situations from a 'world' where a presentation card is amazingly relevant for the satisfaction of a person. The film moves really fast so it is impossible not to be attached to it with its many unique situations: at a point is absolute unique and also hilarious to hear the words that Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) express about his favourite music with such seriousness. In this character Bale is simply terrific, probably his best work to date, and the support cast is full of familiar faces: Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Justin Theroux and Chloë Sevigny and all making great performances.In short, American Psycho is a very recommendable film and it is very easy to enjoy. It is all about the mind. 9.5 out of 10",9,0,2,26 July 2008
American Beauty," The Pretenders
","Lester (Kevin Spacey) is a disillusioned 40 years old man. He doesn't have a good relation with his wife (Annette Bening) and his daughter (Thora Birch) hates him. After meeting Angela (Mena Suvari) his life suddenly change and he is going to feel the freedom again.'American Beauty' is definitely the most famous film of 1999, a year with many films that now are true modern classics. I really enjoyed this film and i think it has a great impact because it has common people as characters. A family of pretenders: Lester is a good man but is really unhappy because he can't be free in his family. I think he is a good man because he feel worry about his daughter but he can't communicate that to her. His daughter his unhappy too because she can't accept herself and she is always insecure. And the mother, who has to pretend that she is happy to obtain success in her work. Finally when the three meet new persons, they feel the happiness again but those persons (Angela, Ricky and Buddy King) are three pretenders too that are having a confusing time. The scene when we confirm that Lester was a true good person in when he finally can have Angela, the girl of his dreams, but suddenly he wakes up from that dream and realize that Angela is just a child, the best friend of his daughter, and he doesn't abuse of her innocence, the innocence that Angela was afraid to show. And Lester did that because of the times when he was finally happy, the happiness that ends because of the most unhappy character in the story, Col. Frank Fits,USMC.About the cast: a great performance of Spacey steals the film but the rest of the cast are good too. The performance of Mena Suvari is just memorable and Thora Birch is just good, in a minor but important character. It's a fact that Thora appears more than Mena but the scenes with Mena's character and just the most famous scenes of the film.Conclusion: for me the debut film of Sam Mendes is a very well written and entertaining film with a memorable Spacey and great rock music. To call it 'the best thing to happen in 20 years' is just overrate but definitely is a worth watching film that by now every film lover of the world have already check. 8 out of 10",8,1,2,6 March 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Chameleon, giant midgetDewey Cox ladies and gentlemen
","This never went to the theaters of my city and it was recently when my uncle got its DVD. He loved it and talked to me about it and I was like 'hey I really wanted to look at it' then I saw it obviously. Previously I found that Apatow Team film with Owen Wilson as the main 'attraction' as a very average and somehow very disappointing film yet later I found some films from the same time that were what I expected and by now there are three films of the Apatow Team that for me are just very funny and definitely were what I expected. This is one of them. We have and enjoy a parody that simply is based on constants. For Dewey Cox everything happened in a very short time and his story at its beginning has another protagonist in his brother Nate. They made everything just perfect, a charming and extremely talented kid dreaming about a life full of important events, full of excitement, a kid being just happy for a new beautiful day. They made everything perfect just for that event that marked Dewey Cox forever, that machete situation. After that event everything moved faster so we can say that Dewey was a precocious boy or better we can say that was extremely precocious and with a unique voice, he understood the blues. His dream was closer in a very short time so those big responsibilities began; very soon he was the last hope in order to restore one man's faith in Judaism and with that goal completed 35 minutes later he was a new sensation, sharing the stage with Elvis and like him making that the girls went crazy. He was a chameleon and we really enjoy that. One day he knew drugs, other day he wanted to be a punk rocker (he was sort of the beginner of punk) and in other period he was a Dylan follower, influenced by Dylan in all the ways (hilarious, great lyrics!). All because the constant issues with women, drugs, jails, new friends, Johns, Pauls, Georges, Ringos, etc. His own L ucy in the S ky with D iamonds period is very colorful and is animated! We all know how the great musicians changes, from the young sensation to the big rock star, the bad influence, the legend. Here we have a extremely entertaining and very funny mix of that, here each of the changes of our featured musician are very well known periods, he seems to have prove all the different tastes and that delivers just pure fun and great musical moments. Even when his old music was simply destroyed by some new hip-hop sensation is just perfect for Dewey, not for his extremely known music but certainly for his last masterpiece.The cast is extremely familiar and more because I have seen not very long time ago The 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad (Jonah Hill, Gerry Bednob and Jane Lynch are here). Of course there are more memorable cameos than others and in that way we have the second cameo in a 2007 film of The Beatles (Jack Black C**k, Jason Schwartzman, Paul Rudd and Justin Long), the appearance of the great Eddie Veder and The White Stripe Raconteur Jack White as Elvis; a lot of fun with those appearances. Reilly is a funny guy,here is simply great and he has the luck to be together with Jenna Fisher who plays of course Darlene Madison, the woman of Dewey Cox's life. Also the makeup is terrific, they look great at their last live appearance!I dare to write that every fan of music will find in this a very enjoyable film. Dewey Cox certainly was a legend and this film goes beyond the facts and enters into the myths (in 'The Real Dewey Cox' featurette Apatow claims that this was based upon Cox's autobiography that was full of lies, just crap). Absolutely entertaining and hilarious, Walk Hard is simply that. 9.5 out of 10Something about the DVD: The featurette 'The Real Dewey Cox' is really funny, some of the anecdotes are not as funny as the ones of Reilly, Sheryl Crow, Jewel and Judd Apatow to mention some. Also I found hilarious extended Beatles scene, John and Paul are simply fantastic! By the way and finally, funny Morrison spoof in the poster.",9,1,1,17 August 2008
Duck Soup," Crazy Ducks. Crazy Politicians. Pointless War
","I think that all the work of the Marx Brothers, Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton is really worth watching, since their most famous films, their masterpieces to the minor works and their short films. After watch and love all the feature films of Charlie Chaplin (with the little exception of A King in New York) and some of his short films, I really had desires to watch something of the Marx Brothers and Buster Keaton. A week ago I saw my first Buster Keaton film, The General (Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton, 1927), and yesterday I saw my first Marx Brothers film, Duck Soup, and I really enjoyed it.The situation in Duck Soup is simple: Freedonia has a new leader (Groucho Marx). Sylvania wants to have Freedonia 'under their flag' and for that they send two spies (Harpo and Chico Marx) to try to find something compromising about Rufus T. Firefly, new leader of Freedonia.If we have Groucho as that new leader, well we should ask why. The issue is that Freedonia was in crisis so they needed millions from Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) but she has one condition to give them the money: they need to name Rufus T. Firefly as the new leader. Is a really fine and really hilarious performance of Groucho but definitely Firefly is an annoying person and the ambassador of Sylvania, Trentino (Louis Calhern), is the one that is going to suffer the most Firefly's personality and all can and will end in only one thing: war, a pointless war (pleonasm).The other bros, Harpo and Chico as Pinky and Chicolini, are as annoying and crazy as Firefly. This two are just hilarious but more with a physical humour (Pinky, Harpo's character, never talks) and they made truly memorable sequences in this film. As Trentino is suffering with Firefly, a lemonade vendor (Edgar Kennedy) will be really suffering with both spies that soon will be together with Firefly. The result of this is my favourite sequence of the entire film; yes the mirror sequence with three Grouchos! Magnificent. But war is there (hilarious to see after the last try for peace of Mrs. Teasdale how Firefly for a simple supposition ends with the last hope for peace) and another memorable sequences and the final part of Duck Soup.Finally, I just loved my first Marx Brothers picture. Duck Soup is short (65 minutes), hilarious (many great dialogs and stuff to list them all) and a really unique war film that has the absurd reasons of a war as a background. I highly recommend this film to anyone! Show this one to your family!",Null,1,2,30 June 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," 'And if I say to you tomorrow, take my hand, child, come with me'
","In that recent directors talk from the Hollywood Reporter, David O. Russell told his colleagues about the hard times as a director (and on a more personal level too with a divorce) he had after making THREE KINGS (1999) – he feels he 'lost his own way' after that film and began to 'overthink things trying to be too interesting, too particular nothing feels right, no project feels right'. It was until THE FIGHER (2010) came, more than ten years later, that Russell felt he was doing what's he's best at; in the meantime between 'Kings' and THE FIGHTER, Russell had more darkness -he did a film that was never finished, began having financial problems and couldn't get the money for his much wanted adaptation of the novel THE SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK- than light -he directed only one feature, 2004's I <3 HUCKABEES-. For Russell, THE FIGHTER was, at first sight, too conventional, with a story that has been seen before. He is convinced that 10 years ago he would have let go THE FIGHTER or any similar project, but I imagine when his actual chance to direct that boxing film came he wasn't really in a position to refuse the job, saying to himself 'why don't you try to do this really good? See if you can do this from the heart and mean it'. The rest my friends is history – in my book, THE FIGHTER is a great one. Following this success, Russell didn't waste time and only two years later he returned, doing finally the 'Silver Linings' adaptation. He has repeated the success with tons of accolades, including the Oscar nomination for best picture (not to mention the four nominations for his cast). Good for him, as SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK may not be my favorite of the year but it doesn't disappoints. Let's see, here we have a protagonist (Bradley Cooper) that suffers of bipolar disorder – it's definitely interesting and very well portrayed, with remarkable scenes that let us see what's like to live with someone who can be at times notably happy but at others extremely irritated by issues like finding a not-really-happy ending in a Ernest Hemingway book (!). But let's make no mistake folks, as at core SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK features a story as conventional and rehashed as any dealing with the struggles of a sportsman. Russell insisted in doing 'Silver Linings' because of his son, who suffers too of bipolar disorder. But I like to think that this director said once again to himself something like 'Yes, I've seen hundreds of romantic flicks, with a guy who's wrong and doesn't sees who is the girl that truly loves him. Nevertheless, I'm doing the film and I'll try to do it *really good*'. As a matter of fact, of all the romantic comedies in recent memory, this ranks amongst the most memorable ones, just as THE FIGHTER as one of the best films about sport (and addiction too). The main reason why 'Fighter' was a superb picture about yet another common issue like drug addiction is certainly the incredible performance of Christian Bale. Don't expect, however, to be blown away by the Oscar-nominated supporting cast of 'Silver Linings'. I'm really happy for Robert De Niro but he really doesn't do much as a hardcore Philadelphia Eagles fan; the same goes for Jacki Weaver – recently, she was a whole lot better in 2010's ANIMAL KINGDOM (she lost an Oscar for that performance to 'Fighter'!). Nobody 'stole' the show from the main couple (Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) – Cooper doesn't look anymore like a spoiled dude, giving the performance of his life so far, and Lawrence is really sweet as the classic girl who has to be the friend and adviser of a guy who can't move on from a failed relationship. Arguably, when you have a formulaic story the thing has to be about those details and unique elements. 'Silver Linings' is rich in those: like I said, we have the bipolar issue (look for a great temperamental scene of Cooper set to Led Zeppelin's 'What Is And What Should Never Bee'!), and another look from Russell to the sports world (from the fan perspective this time) – definitely anyone who knows a real fanatic of any sport will connect as here football, for De Niro especially, ain't any sort of entertainment but really a way of life and of making (and losing) money. You know you're watching a worthy film when its key scene, the one that sets the tone of the conclusion, mixes all of the elements to create a unique, crazy and memorable thing. Football, superstition, therapy, everything is there to clearly expose that Jennifer Lawrence is the right girl for Cooper. Hell, at the dance that represents their soon-to-be great love, they dance and jump and go crazy to the White Stripes' 'Fell In Love With A Girl'! What's not to like? *Watched it on 10 February, 2013",8,0,1,22 February 2013
Monsters vs. Aliens," 'I think that Jello gave me a fake phone number'; Monsters vs. Aliens: 8.5/10
","I think Roger Ebert said just about right: 'Monsters vs. Aliens is possibly the most commercial title of the year. How can you resist such a premise, especially if it's in 3-D animation?'. Well in Roger Ebert's case 'very readily' but in my case even with the fact that the trailer never ended to convince me that this movie was one of those that I must see on the big screen I could not resist to go and pay for the 3-D version of the movie. Hell I'm glad I came, I wanted to see this movie however for what I thought of it after seeing the previews I must say I found in Monsters vs. Aliens a real pleasant surprise. I don't like to see dubbed movies, certainly only if the movie is in English or, obviously, in Spanish I don't read the subtitles (yes even that I don't write that well in English I do understand the I think 95% of a movie if I don't pay attention to the Spanish subtitles), certainly in Mexico, like I think in any other country, movies for kids are in its dubbed version in most if not all of the theaters. So yes I saw this movie in its dubbed version, thing that I really dislike especially if the people doing the voices are a******* like in this case but anyway I will see someday again Monsters vs. Aliens since I liked it a lot and I will see it in its original language to hear Seth Rogen, Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and company. Monsters vs. Aliens ends as you expected since always and ends leaving plenty of room if not too much room for a sequel, basically is just the beginning of the team of monsters that will defend the Earth of whatever comes to the writers' minds for the possible sequel or sequels. I didn't care that much about the plot, I won't mention it in this little comment; certainly the premise was just 'monsters vs. aliens' for well whatever reason and yes all the monsters are really appealing characters. I like how it begins since is like meteor alert, normal day at a wedding and we have our 50-foot woman. There's the typical message, certainly the monsters will be seen as heroes but anyway B.O.B. (voice of, stoner, Seth Rogen) teals the monsters' show, this one is a terrific good-looking movie. Now I can't wait to see the new Pixar production Up!",Null,0,1,7 April 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Calm down, kids, 'Dragon Tattoo' is not a masterpiece! I quite enjoyed it, tough
","Sometimes the hype for something gives you the excitement and the anticipation. But sometimes what happens is the exact opposite. I didn't believe the hype for anything THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I stayed away from the books, the Swedish films and the American version. I read in twitter someone who was like 'this is the very first time I ain't rushing to see a David Fincher film in its opening day'. While I'm not crazy about Fincher, I do love most of his stuff. And since ZODIAC (from 2007) I have been there, with great expectation, for the new Fincher picture. 'Dragon Tattoo' was the exception for me too; I just wasn't waiting for it. But after all, I did ended watching it on the big screen during its first week in my city! My sister (a huge fan of the books) went to the opening day on Friday, loved it and then took me to the cinema yesterday. * Did you like it? * Of course when the credits rolled she asked me that. The first thing I said to her was that it was really damn long, but that yes, I did like it.Let me be clear: 'Dragon Tattoo' is not a masterpiece. It's very enjoyable, but for all the kids who were truly impressed I will have the following few words: calm the f*** down, I have seen this many times before and I have seen better (from Fincher himself)! Hell, I even thought this was some sort of KILL BILL as more than just one person (especially the women) was praising a lot the ' fearless girl getting revenge of a pig f****** man' thing. But that actually is just a small part of the film. Pretty much it's a subplot of a subplot, if that makes sense. We have like two different films going on. The film of Daniel Craig's character Mikael and the film of Rooney Mara's character Lisbeth. The first one is a classic murder mystery story I'm a huge sucker for this kind of murder mystery thing and I really loved some of the elements. The setting is classic. I think the last time I watched something similar was in THE GHOST WRITER by Roman Polanski: main character leaves home (here Mikael travels to an island in Sweden) do a extremely well-paid job for one man; he settles there and of course there will be some strange things mystery, it is. The whole thing going on in the island is quite interesting, and it works: it's an island that is owned by a family of powerful businessmen, and also some former Nazis. And pretty much there's not great communication between them. Anyway, my only problem with this whole setting was the language thing. I guess it was a difficult situation for Fincher, and I appreciated (even as a guy who, like I said, haven't read the books nor watch the Swedish film trilogy) the fact that he didn't move the story to, for instance, the US (think in LET ME IN). It would have not been the same. But then again, why not at least have the supporting Swedish characters speaking nothing less than Swedish? I would have loved that for sure. And on the other hand there's the central figure of the film: the girl with the dragon tattoo. Miss Rooney Mara, I applaud you. I didn't even realize she was the same actress with the small yet important role in Fincher's previous feature THE SOCIAL NETWORK! Her character is, as needed, very likable. I guess the thing I enjoyed most of this film was that it builds the two most important characters by separated and when they finally meet all the expectations are covered. I mean, we know we are watching everything for that important thing that is their meeting. It's a great kind of entertainment, with Craig and Mara really on fire. Think in SE7EN. There's brutal stuff here too (about rapists, serial killers and the Bible – and yes, the word Bible fits perfect in that sentence!). Even tough our two detectives are actually a journalist and a hacker, there's great police stuff too (with Macbooks and scanned old photos everywhere). However, and sadly, the film eventually drags a bit, and falls to be pretty ordinary. And ordinary may not be the problem but just that there's nothing brilliantly shocking anymore. Something's missing, and that something is a key factor for not having me rushing in order to see the Swedish trilogy or read the books. *Watched it on the big screen on January 25, 2012",Null,1,4,27 January 2012
Being John Malkovich," Eternal life
","This film is just magnificent. It has many different themes and makes that you can find so many different ways to enjoy it. It may be seen as a portrait of a relationship, work and love but most notorious as a portrait of the human mind. In the end is a science fiction film that uses that to make a better study of the mind upon an amazingly original story full of creativity.That story begins with Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), a great puppeteer who has no luck and no work. Lotte (Cameron Diaz) is his wife who loves pets having many of them in their house. As I write, Craig's abilities as a puppeteer were really good but that wasn't enough to obtain a job so he decides to take a job as filing clerk. When Craig enters for the first time in the 7½ floor of the building where he will work, we start to feel that this is going to be really weird, even that may be a reasonable explanation of why they made a floor between the 7th and the 8th floors is just so bizarre and really hilarious to watch a floor in which the employees cannot stand upright. Maxine (Catherine Keener) works there too and soon will be the love desire of Craig. Also we meet Lester (Orson Bean), the new boss of Craig who only talks about his wet dreams.So we have this four main characters whose personalities will be different after Craig discover a portal. Here is when the weird story, written by Charlie Kaufman, really begins with this portal that can take you to the mind of John Malkovich so for 15 minutes you can be witness of what this actor do through his eyes. Upon that we have a really interesting view to the different behaviour of Craig, Lotte and Maxine, after they know about the portal. Craig only thinks in the human mind and many philosophical-type questions, Maxine looks this portal just as a business and Lotte is the first one who feels a sort of addiction to that experience finding through Malkovich the man inside her. Here the film is hilarious having a couple, Craig and Lotte, in love with the same woman, Maxine. Lotte and Maxine will find a connection between them but only when Lotte is 'inside' Malkovich and because Malkovich is just so innocent well he doesn't care if Maxine call him Lotte. Suddenly the film turns even weirder and more interesting when Malkovich is no longer Malkovich in consequence of having a puppeteer inside his mind. Finally Craig can be near Maxine who is still a very strange character being just taking advantage of the circumstances. The end is nothing but brilliant with the real plans of Lester, Maxine having a 'normal' life with Lotte and with the eternal life as a possible thing leaving Malkovich just as another victim and Craig completely lost.About the cast: Everybody here did just a terrific work. Even that I'm not a fan of John Cusack I loved his performance as a confused puppeteer with a big obsession. The beautiful Cameron Diaz looks really different in the first part of the film and she is just great. I will always recognize Catherine Keener because of the film 'Living in Oblivion' and here is terrific in a very strange character. John Malkovich as himself is fantastic, first is just fun but later he end being a victim in this cruel but brilliant conclusion. And my favourite cameo is the one of Charlie Sheen, giving advices to Malkovich about hot lesbian witches; just hilarious as his new look after seven years. Also Sean Penn is in the film, talking in the TV show about the new phase of Malkovich as a puppeteer.Conclusion: Hilarious, interesting, moving, entertaining and so damn unique. It is fantastic how Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, more specific the last one, created a unique and bizarre world with those surrealistic and weird situations and, upon that, they created a very human story showing how we find irresistible to prove how does it feels to be someone else, in this case a person with fame, and also how this persons left everything, of course including their own personalities, to get some fame or to be young again. A really interesting portrait of the human mind. So for me 'Being John Malkovich' is nothing but another reason to remember the year 1999 as a wonderful year for Cinema. What a great film this is!Region 4 DVD: Another great single-disc release by Universal Pictures. It contains many extras and a very original menu. Some of the extras are the trailer, four imaginative and funny TV spots, the complete videos of the story of the 7½ and the story of the 'new' John Malkovich (in the film both videos are seen on TV), the art of puppeteering, Spike's photo album and some others. The interview with Spike Jonze is definitely unique but actually he doesn't answer any question. Anyway, watching this film on this terrific DVD just left me a lot of desires to get the DVD of 'Adaptation' (2002) as soon as I can.",9,1,2,19 May 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," 40 Years Later
","I recently write in my comment for Get Smart (Peter Segal, 2008) that I do found funny Steve Carell but not that funny to get me excited every time he has a new film so I never has real desires to watch Get Smart on the big screen (eventually I do watch it). A similar thing happened to me with this film, back in 2005 when it was released in my country, so I never saw The 40 Year Old Virgin on the big screen but I heard some good things about it and also read in this site good things about it so I had some desires to give it a chance but still wasn't the very first option. I have to mention Get Smart again because after founding a very funny Carell on that film I finally decided to watch this comedy and it was a very good decision.Well, Andy (Steve Carell) is the mentioned virgin and a worker of an electronics store, a collector of toys and obviously the kind of shy guy who never has a real contact with his partners at work that in this case are Jay (Romany Malco), Cal (Seth Rogen) and David (Paul Rudd). Quickly, during a poker match, the three friends knows Andy's secret ad the first part of the film is just a hilarious search for Andy's first sexual experience, of course with the help of Jay, Cal and David. Trish Piedmont (Catherine Keener) is the woman in who Andy has a real interest but still the guy needs just sex and following the many different advices of his friends he believes that he is not ready for Trish. Finally meeting really Trish makes a kind of more serious movie thanks to this 'serious' relationship but is still hilarious and again bad luck, karma or whatever but again when sex is near for Andy something always happens. In this case the 16 years old daughter of Trish (Kat Dennings) appears in Andy's life and his relation with Trish turns better but they will have sex till the 20th date. This part has a scene that definitely is not the funniest one of the entire movie but the situation in that scene is the funniest one of the movie. Imagine a 16 years old girl and a 40 years old man together in a orientation meeting about sex and both with a lot of desires to have their first sexual experience, both interested about the meeting and both considered liars when both confess their virginity. Great scene. The conclusion is even kind of sweet and of course is a really happy ending for Andy and in consequence for Trish and with the help of some expensive toys they are a very happy couple.Cast: Steve Carell is simply terrific and perhaps this is his best work till now. The group of friends is hilarious, even with their simple conclusion, and Malco, Rogen and Rudd are very good. To mention the character of Gerry Bednob, Mooj, that is one of the funniest things of the film. Nothing to write about Catherine Keener apart that she is a great actress and that she has been part of terrific films, my favourites with her are Being John Malkovich (Spike Jonze, 1999) and Living in Oblivion (Tom DiCillo, 1995).Conclusion: I expected a very funny film but still this was a really pleasant surprise since comedies from the Apatow productions don't looked very interesting to me (with the exception of Walk Hard) and after watching Drillbit Taylor they looked less interesting. Well I really enjoyed this comedy, the unrated version (133 minutes), and I think is time to finally watch Superbad and Knocked Up, after all the hype.",Null,0,1,30 June 2008
The Intouchables," dancing in September
","I knew that THE INTOUCHABLES was playing in more cinemas than the ones a European picture usually gets to in Mexico City. It's still playing actually (and will continue to, at least, till next Thursday), which means that the film has survived in cinemas more than a month – a real achievement since this is a city where not even the films of a modern American auteur like Wes Anderson remain in theaters more than a week or two. I watched the trailer of THE INTOUCHABLES (its Mexican title is AMIGOS, which means 'FRIENDS') once and it seemed all right, but really nothing that attracted me enough to rush to the cinema. Then I realized it was part of IMDb's always-controversial top 250 – I knew I had to check it out as soon as possible, for mere movie geek curiosity. First, I will have to answer to that obvious question regarding the top 250: no, I don't think it's one of the greatest films of all-time, much less the seventieth. In fact, I wasn't impressed but then again, I'm not really part of the kind of audience that love or will love it – I mean, one can easily see why this film is a success with audiences all around the world. It's definitely a good one and I got it and enjoyed the good of it. Is there something bad about it then? Well, not really – the film tried to be both funny and meaningful and it was. One can argue about the underdevelopment of some interesting issues (like the whole background story of one of the two main characters; the one played by Omar Sy), but that would be just unimportant. My girlfriend watched it with me and she enjoyed it a whole lot; in fact, she would watch it again, while I wouldn't. Is clear to me that most women will adore it, so yeah, you should take your special one to see it. To finish this brief commentary, I'm listing some other thoughts on the film:1) The music is very tasty; the American band Earth, Wind & Fire plays an important role here. We have a nice and memorable title sequence inside a car set to one of their songs ('September'); for me it will be very difficult from now on to hear that famous song and not think in Omar Sy's character Driss. And I heard some other good tunes, so I'm definitely getting the full soundtrack (although the band is mentioned by Driss, there aren't Kool & the Gang songs, by the way). 2) A joke on how the art world works reminded of Banksy's EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP. You know, it shows that sometimes art is all about freakin' hype. 3) Omar Sy shines. It was my introduction to this French actor and his character was definitely my favorite element of the film. It's classic stuff really, with a young and crazy-pot-smoking dude who's just f' hilarious – I imagine that the controversial Italian footballer Mario Balotelli is just like Driss (I hope that makes sense to you). 4) The film has the classic 'clash of different worlds' thing. You know the storyline already, right? The young and crazy dude, from the ghetto, gets a job as the carer of a quadriplegic and wealthy man. It's obvious material, but not really in a bad way – for instance, there's a scene in which Driss is shaving his pal Philippe (the wealthy man; played by François Cluzet, who sort-of looks like Robert De Niro) and I could see the Hitler mustache joke coming a mile away. And just like the joke was still all right, the whole film feels like that no matter of the obvious issues it offers. *Watched it on 23 September, 2012",8,0,0,6 October 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," This year's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'; I mean, what a great reboot!
","There's a moment in THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN that is basically the quintessential romantic one involving a superhero: Spidey is about to take his girlfriend (Gwen Stacy) out for a little ride, to show her how New York City looks from the sky. I guess you know what I mean. And when the moment came I thought something like this: if director Marc Webb (who's only other film is the hit 500 DAYS OF SUMMER, which I have yet to watch) wants to take a few minutes for a sort of clichéd romantic scene, well, that's just fine with me since until this point he has given me nothing but a great piece of entertainment. Eventually we don't even get to see pretty much nothing of that romantic kind of scene! So basically I was ready to criticize the film and at the same time forgive its flaws, but in the end that was just unnecessary. Yes, there's really nothing to complaint about this movie; (for instance) I did feel its last act could have been bigger and more exciting but then again, I'm here to forgive the minor flaws. It's actually a very similar case to what we had last year with RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES – a very fine and fun reboot -visually great, with fresh ideas- that keeps you with a big smile (and that leaves you too with it since you just know really nice things will come in the future). During this past week I got to see a newspaper article of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN with the title 'The Unnecessary Spider-Man'. And yesterday when my girlfriend and I were about to watch the film, she asked me that if it was going to show the Spider-Man story from its very beginning again (and she ended loving it, by the way). Judging from yesterday's attendance at the cinema I went (it was a 6 p.m. showing in the opening day, to be exact), many people don't want to rush in order to see the 'same ol' story' that a decade ago hit the big screen; yes, the attendance was quite low and boy did people missed a whole lot of fun and, of course, the great Lizard! To finish, I'll write some few more thoughts that do nothing other than recommend you checking 'Amazing Spider-Man' as soon as possible 1) You MUST go for the 3D version of it. And yes, I know that pretty much every film has offered a very disappointing use of this format so that's why I'm so glad to report that this looks simply amazing - I think the only other recent time I loved the 3D thing was in THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN. 2) Arguably a perfect example of a film with forgettable 3D material is THE AVENGERS. And 'Amazing Spider-Man' is MUCH BETTER than that other big Marvel movie of the year! 3) The first time we get to see Spider-Man, with the actual mask and everything, doing some work has to be one of my favorite scenes in any superhero movie. His attitude is fantastically fun; Andrew Garfield fits the role perfectly, I must say. 4) Not my opinion but a fact: this has the best Stan Lee cameo ever; what a piece of scene actually, fun and imaginative (and a bit violent too!).*Watched it on 06 July, 2012",10,5,10,7 July 2012
The Exorcist," Father Paranoia
","Basically everybody knows everything about this film and that's, in a way, because it has a very simple plot. 'The Exorcist' is a terrific film that, from a simple plot, has a great development of the characters and shows the change of all the character's mind. The film begins with Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), a mother who is worry because of the strange behavior of her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) and, at the same time, the Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller) is having a complicated time too, dealing with his mother's terminal sickness. As the film continues, the situation causes more and more desperation in the characters and both are looking for solutions. In consequence of the dead of his mother, the Father Damian begins to lose his faith and at the same time Chris, in a desperate act, finds in the faith the last hope for her daughter. And finally when the exorcist (Max Von Sydow) arrives we can see how Pazuzu works, attacking to your deepest feelings. But why the victim is a very young girl? I think that is one of the many reasons of why this film was very disturbing and banned in some countries in it's time, because gives the audience the sensation that anybody could be danger, even in a secure place like your own house. But I think that the biggest reason of why this film was very controversial is because it touches a universal and very delicate theme like religion. Besides that the main theme is an exorcism, phrases like 'Let Jesus f*ck you, let Jesus f*ck you. Let him f*ck you' or 'Your mother s*cks c*cks in Hell, Karras, you faithless slime' were probably an insult to many people.The Cast: Everybody did a good job. Ellen Burstyn is great in the main role as a really brave mother, a bit similar to the role of Mia Farrow in 'Rosemary's Baby'. Linda Blair is good in the best role of her entire life, definitely a difficult role that will stay with her forever. Conclusion: 'The Exorcist' is one of the finest horror films ever with a tremendous impact as any other. Definitely a must see for any Cinema lover and a perfect film for a Friday at midnight.",Null,1,2,24 March 2008
Tropic Thunder," Before the ThunderComes the Madness
","In my case the film summer started with 'Iron Man' and just the following week with 'Speed Racer'. On 10 May 2008 I wrote my comment for 'Speed Racer' and in it I wrote this to finish it: 'I think this film and 'Iron Man' will be my favourites of this year's summer, just waiting to see what 'The Dark Knight' and the new stuff of Jack Black ('Tropic Thunder' and 'Kung Fu Panda') will offer'. I really was waiting to see this movie, which release was going to be last Friday on my city yet and I don't know why it wasn't released. Today I went to a pre-release screening (the official release will be this Friday) together with my uncle, my cousin and a friend really hoping to see the funniest movie of the year. We laughed a lot, truly a lot; 'Tropic Thunder' is the funniest movie of 2008, until now of course, so definitely will be one of my choices for the best movies of 2008.Probably everyone knows what 'Tropic Thunder' is about but if not let's write something about it: the memories of some Vietnam veterans were turned into books but only one was sold to Hollywood, the book Tropic Thunder written by the hero John 'Four Leaf' Tayback (Nick Nolte). He is there on the set seeing as the hero he was and still is and everybody respect that but not when is time of business, not when he tries to say what to do to Hollywood producer Les Grossman and less when Grossman knows that his production is being a complete and really expensive mess. The director (Steve Coogan!!!) is British and for sure is new in Hollywood and is working in a set full of stars, even Oscar winners. Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black (C*ck), Brandon T. Jackson and Jay Baruchel play Tugg Speedman, Kirk Lazarus, Jeff Fats Portnoy, Alpa Chino and Kevin Sandusky, respectively. In their habitat these actors can't enter in their characters, they need something more they need a more realistic environment and Tayback knows where is that place.Downey Jr. has the most unique part; basically everything that Downey Jr. did to portray Kirk Lazarus is what Kirk Lazarus is doing to portray Sgt. Lincoln Osiris. Jack Black's character is the one who miss more Hollywood but Ben Stiller's character is Hollywood. Speedman was a star but now he has been losing the respect in Hollywood, he portrayed a character that went beyond Forrest Gump or Raymond Babbitt, that film is now considered as one of the worst ever but he found a place where his work is appreciate, sure in that place that film is the only available but is a fact that in that place Speedman is still a star, now that place is his home, far away from Hollywood. But before Speedman found his new home he was the only one who still trusted in Hollywood, still trusted in a script and that eventually will take him to the drug dealers. He is the classic hero, convinced in making the film yet in Hollywood his own life is not an important issue. Here, for me, Tom Cruise steals the film as that mentioned Hollywood producer. Is hilarious because after all he is a businessman and business is all he has in mind so when drug dealers treat him to make a pay since they have Speedman our producer ends like a hero and not because he saved Speedman. You have to see Cruise, just memorable. The ones that saved Speedman were the ones who had many problems, insecurity with themselves. After all they are just a bunch of actors lost not only in Hollywood but also in the jungle still they knew quickly what was all about but these actors had that issues that in the jungle will be exposed. Basically one is gay and he almost come out of the closet, other is a drug addict so you imagine him sober with all the anxiety and stuff and the other is pretty much just confused. The only one who is not a star is the only one who knows the script and the only who can command a bunch of Hollywood stars. After all nobody was expecting to find some great persons in those stars and nobody was expecting the truth of a hero, a man who probably is the best actor, a man who had never left the United States, a man who's full time character's name is John 'Four Leaf' Tayback. But also every problem can be fixed and look at them, specially at Les Grossman, he was being the producer of the most expensive war movie never made and he ended dancing of happiness with a bunch of Academy Awards! Cast: this is a really familiar cast, Stiller and Black leads the gang but is Downey Jr. who steals the show. Just yesterday I saw 'Knocked Up' so I quickly recognized Jay Baruchel and Bill Hader but anyway and as I wrote before is Tom Cruise who steals the entire picture! Maybe his best role since Frank T.J. Mackey or since John Anderton but anyway it is his funniest appearance ever, just behind his cartoon from South Park of course.Conclusion: this is a hilarious movie; you will remember Oliver Stone, Francis Ford Coppola and some others even Ruggero Deodato. This is a movie about an unfinished movie that ends not only as a unique experience but also as an Academy Award winner documentary. I loved it, simply, and I want it's DVD!!!",10,3,11,26 August 2008
Quantum of Solace," Action? Everywhere All Around the World
","I'm a young fella, young enough to can say that I haven't seen almost all of the James Bond films and not feel really ashamed however now I feel true desires to finally read some of the books by Ian Fleming and watch more James Bond films. But I do watched Casino Royale and actually I haven't seen it since that time when I saw it on the big screen back in December 2006 then last Friday when I saw the second James Bond film with Daniel Craig, Quantum of Solace, I didn't had very clear in my mind Casino Royale (right now I'm in the same position but as soon as I can I will watch Casino Royale again!) however when the credits of Quantum of Solace were on the big screen I was thinking something like 'I liked it, fun, very entertaining, Bond talking in Spanish (only a few words and some of them don't make a lot of sense!), yeah Quantum of Solace is a good picture but I kind of remember liking more Casino Royale'. Now if you check the comments by IMDb users you will find that this film was a complete disappointment for many, a lot of reviews with 6 out of 10 stars and what I just write about liking more Casio Royale is probably the most repetitive phrase about Quantum of Solace. Action? Well, everywhere all around the world, we see Bond in Italy, Haiti, Austria, Bolivia, Russia and we see him killing and killing. Is also funny that practically we see Bond in action on the road, on a boat, on a plane and even with an opera as background (probably my favourite scene), for me was really fun to watch those action sequences, Bond will not be interrogating on this one. But what's the story? Well I don't think is really important since basically is typical, we have a bastard who's Dominic Greene (nice performance by Mathieu Amalric who was completely unknown for me) and who's plan is obviously just for his own ambition however only we and Bond will know that. Then we have practically a lonely Bond in this mission but certainly M knows that Bond knows something. Sexy Olga Kurylenko plays Camille Montes and certainly the story of this character is nothing new, classic stuff: she will be in the side of Bond but she has her own mission, she wants vengeance against the one who ended with her family. So we have Medrano, a character who can be seen as an enemy but certainly with Bond facing Dominic Greene would have been enough however Camille is after Medrano, it was really fun to watch Jesus Ochoa as one of Medrano's men even that he don't says a single thing but definitely he is not as fun as that crazy Bolivian taxi driver who unlike Ochoa's character never stop talking! I really enjoyed certain details like Bond talking in Spanish and definitely I can write that Quantum of Solace is a nice Bond picture. Certainly I made that my own comment will not be really 'valid' for those big James Bond fans just by writing what I wrote at the beginning however i really liked this film period. Oh and the credits sequence is really magnificent, I liked the main theme by Jack White and Alicia Keys however is one of the weakest efforts by Jack White that I have heard, certainly I can't say that of Keys because I don't know her music. Finally, this is fun but don't expect Casino Ro see I was about to write the most repetitive bottom line in Quantum of Solace comments but I will write my own: in what I remember Casino Royale was good but not that fantastic, Quantum of Solace is just good so go and watch it on the big screen!",Null,2,4,16 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," No Country for Weak Men?
","While Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) was hunting pronghorn near the Rio Bravo (or Rio Grande for North Americans), he found a mark of blood that take him to a typical drug dealers scene with abandoned cars and death bodies. There he found a bag with two million dollars. Soon he will be followed by a hit-man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) and by the local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who is trying to help Llewelyn from those very dangerous men.The script of this perfect film was adapted by the Coen brothers from the novel with the same name by Cormac McCarthy. The plot of the film is simple in a way, showing an strange crime story setting in the old West. But there are too many things that make this film more than just another crime/western film and those same things are still in my head trying to be completely understood. One of those things are the great and memorable characters; Llewelyn Moss is the representation of the average man doing anything for money, Ed Tom Bell is the classic old man surprised by the increased of violence in his region and always in defense of the law. But the most mysterious and unique character is Anton Chigurh, since his strange last name, his strange haircut and his strange weapon ( a captive bolt pistol) to the fact that we don't know anything about him just that he kill everything that is close to him. Even the other main characters (Llewelyn and Ed) never confront Anton face to face, so it definitely one of the strangest characters that i have ever seen on a film. Another thing that is great in this film is the interpretation of the fate and how you can't stop what's coming. I mean, after watching the film a person who was with me tell me 'all because Llewelyn fell remorse for the Mexican asking for water and he return', but for me even he never come back to the scene of the drug deal, Chigurh will be following him because the bag of the money contains the radar and because Llewelyn did something that change his life forever and he can't go back. Just as the coin toss, because is a simple decision but it can change your life. There are a lot of great dialogs that will make you watch this film more than one or two times.The cast: is perfect and i'm not surprised of all the awards that came and the ones that will come. They are all great but Bardem steals, without a doubt, the film as Anton. For me is his best role in all of his career and is a fact that is his most 'popular' role.The Coen brothers: this is the first adapted film that they have done and is with the same beautiful cinematography of most of their films, showing the old West as the unique scenery for a story like that. Right now are as popular as great; who cares if the Academy doesn't give them the awards, they will be the same great directors with or without the Oscar. For me 'No Country for Old Men' is their best film since 'O Brother Where Art Thou?' from 2000, and is my third personal favourite of them. And left me the desire of re-watch all of his films before the release of the DVD.Conclusion: i love this film and is the best i have seen in this year. Is great when a great film like this one is as great as popular because a lot of people will watch it just for it nominations. Anyway, i'm just waiting for the DVD to watch it at least three more times. 10 out of 10PS: the Mexican title for this film is 'Sin Lugar Para Los Debiles', that means, 'Without a Place for the Weaks'. I don't like when they change the essence of the title but for me is not bad the Mexican title because it's a fact that in a situation like that you can't be weak.",10,2,9,10 February 2008
District 9," District 9 is the capital of every ghetto town
","Saw this one for the very first time back in Christmas Eve 2009, on DVD. Loved it. I finally saw it for the second time today, this time on Blu-Ray. Had the same feeling, certainly. In what is my second favourite 2009 movie (just behind Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds') we have an early sort of warning: 'to everyone's surprise, the ship didn't come to a stop over Manhattan or Washington or Chicago but instead coasted to a halt directly over the city of Johannesburg'. It's like an announcement that basically warn us that this is not going to be our typical alien movie, not the 'aliens coming to kill us all' kind of thing. Just like its filming style (at first presented as a documentary, as we see footage and post-events interviews, and later as a regular movie), it's a hybrid that successfully adapts classic sci-fi elements to the human condition. We are told that the aliens (the prawns) 'were extremely malnourished, they were very unhealthy they seemed to be aimless'. Like I said, this isn't a very typical setting. So think in every little thing that happens in a slum, or just in society in general and add the sci-fi element of having aliens. It's just great. It's like a new world but really is just everything that happens in our world: the prawns have a strange addiction to cat food, then there you have the humans (the 'Nigerians', the only human group who lives with the prawns in the District 9) selling or changing for weapons the precious cat food to the prawns. The prawns are stuck in Johannesburg, they get to know the human condition, and they become in the 'people' from the ghetto. My uncle said to me, when I told him I had just seen again 'District 9', 'isn't Wikus -the protagonist of the movie- sort of like the protagonist of 'Brazil'?'. And I was like 'yes, both are like a innocent protagonist, kind of soft, but only at first sight or in real life'. Plus, both characters work for the *system*. So, I didn't really think in a movie like 'Brazil' after seeing this one, but after my uncle said that to me I immediately recall the words of both Edgar Wright and Richard Kelly when they presented it at the New Beverly Cinema back in January. Their sort of love letter to Terry Gilliam's masterpiece (my personal favourite of him so far) basically focused on how ambitious, how big the project was for its time and how great is visually and how many great visual gags offer to that kind of stuff. And they only mentioned the classic 'not to mention' to reference to all the sociopolitical commentary of the movie. You can say pretty much the same for 'District 9'. Visually is a spectacular achievement. From character design to special effects, I have only love for it. And it ain't really a huge production ala Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay, as it only cost $30 million (great filmmaking style too). And so, there are lots of things to say when it comes to the 'sociopolitical' thing of 'District 9' (*everything is for the guns*). But it may be like 'South Park' as its creators always say that their one and only job is to make people laugh and if their thing says something more, well good. It may be like 'South Park' since its said that its director Neill Blomkamp set the movie in Johannesburg simply because he is from there! So all the Apartheid and the rest of 'sociopolitical' commentary may be incidental or just something Blomkamp sees as secondary, but is nevertheless great. But in the end, 'District 9' is a masterpiece because, with its great and really attractive context, it makes you really care for the characters, it's really something emotive and exciting, hell it's just one of the last decade's best!",10,5,12,4 March 2011
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The rebirth of a genre?
","'The science fiction films are going in the same way of the westerns, there is nothing original, we have seen everything'. I read this phrase of Ridley Scott (producer of this film) in an article about 'The assassination of JJ by the coward RF' before i watch the film.I saw this film yesterday and i was thinking in that phrase because i really like this film so with '3:10 to Yuma' and soon with 'No country for old men', Hollywood is trying to rebirth the most American genre in films and at least this film (i haven't seen the others)is a new type of western, not the classic one with heroes and shots everywhere.I mean this film contains all the elements of a classic western but it focus more into the character's minds and that's make it different so i think this the best western since Unforgiven and that is a film of 1992.I mean, there is the classics of the genre with the legendary John Wayne (The Searchers, Rio Bravo, etc.)making team with John Ford and with the great Howard Hawks. My personal favourite of this classics is Rio Bravo which is one of the best westerns ever, but latter there was just clichés in westerns until an Italian re-bird the most American genre: Segio Leone (one of my favourites directors ever) came with his 'Spaghetti westerns' like The dollars trilogy with the great Clint Eastwood and of course the mystic 'Once Upon A Time In The West'. In this films there's my favourite western of all time: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. After that there were good films but it was until Eastwood's Unforgiven that the westerns were back again.So after a quick resume of the most popular westerns, i most say that the 'The assassination.....' is one of my favourite films of this year and i'm almost sure that the Academy is going to give some nominations to this film because Hollywood is trying to rebirth a genre that belong to America and to Sergio Leone.Finally,Brad Pitt make his best performance in the last years and the photography is amazing just like the way the story is told and well the plot is already in the title. Highly recommendable. 9.5 out of 10",9,0,1,20 November 2007
Batman Begins," The Dark Knight Begins
","***Written on 18 July 2008***Before today I haven't watch the first Batman film of Christopher Nolan since its theatrical release, back in summer 2005, and I really enjoyed it a lot at the time, becoming my favourite Batman film since the second and final take of Tim Burton on the legendary comic book superhero, created by Bob Kane.Yesterday I decided to get my tickets for the midnight opening of Nolan's second take on Batman and I really had desires to re-watch Batman Begins before midnight to get in the mood yet I couldn't watched it and actually after watching The Dark Knight I woke up today with more desires to finally watch again this film for the first time since 2005 and I finally did it and I'm glad I did it.We have and we are going to watch three important things of Bruce Wayne's life and by watching two of them we can also and of course watch two important times in the history of Gotham City that are, unfortunately, quite different from each other. The tragic story of Bruce's parents is a relevant part not only in Bruce's life but also in the history of Gotham City itself and seven years after of the release of Joe Chill, murderer of Bruce's parents, Bruce is back after a unique training (a very effective 'introduction' to the character of Batman and is a really great part of the film, mixing that training with the childhood of Bruce) but it is more appropriate to say that here Batman beginsI think that Christian Bale is the best Batman by comparing him with Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney and this time he plays perfect his role as the full-time party man Bruce Wayne. For the first time in the films, the character Lucius Fox appears (played by Morgan Freeman) and he is the one who supply all the equipment of Batman and together with Alfred (this time played -in a good way- by Michael Caine) they will carry with the humour parts of the film. But those are just support characters that are relevant in Bruce Wayne's life yet and of course are not part of the possible destruction of Gotham City.If there are something quite better than Batman and than any other superheroes are their enemies, of course, and definitely the Scarecrow is a great one and with his medicine he will have some terrific scenes but ironically the best of these scenes is when Batman makes that the Scarecrow takes a bit of his own medicine. Yet he was only a puppet and his final appearance in this film is quite a disappointing way to defeat the Scarecrow, courtesy of the weakest character in the film, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes). Then this is a great Batman film, darker, with an effective background story that eventually will be part of the new problem in Gotham City, courtesy of Ra's al Ghul and with a magnificent ending that was just the beginning of today's hype for an enemy. 9.5 out of 10",9,2,2,20 July 2008
Wreck-It Ralph," Fun! Friends! And Fix it Felix Jr. featuring Wreck-it Ralph
","In my recent IMDb commentary for HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA I mentioned Disney's new film WRECK-IT RALPH. This is what I wrote about it: 'one of the trailers I got to watch was the one of the upcoming Disney film WRECK-IT RALPH; it seems that 'Ralph' will not miss the chance to deliver really clever material out of a mash-up of classic characters (video games characters, like Nintendo's Bowser, in that case)'. Now that I have finally seen it I can say that this is a film with a very nicely constructed alternate universe where video game characters are much more than a bunch of pixels. I mean, 'Ralph' does features a whole lot of classic video game characters – in fact, it's one of those things, like the IMAGINATIONLAND trilogy of SOUTH PARK, that you have to watch frame by frame to identify all the famous characters in it. There's Pac-Man, Sonic and the STREET FIGHTER characters. Anyone who grew up in the eighties will be especially thrilled to see those characters, although they are only extras or, in some cases, just part of the background. This goes for that creation of an alternate universe; and it's a real success, with really clever and fun ideas. It's a TOY STORY sort of thing, just replace toys with video game characters and try to answer that same question of 'what would they do if they were anthropomorphic characters?' If the toys have to work for the kids, the video game heroes and villains too – here's there's a whole working system, like in MONSTERS, INC. Yes, in 'Ralph' we have clever ideas through and through, as if it was another gem from Pixar. For instance, we learn everything that happens when a game either breaks or goes out of fashion (it's pretty rough for the characters as you can tell); we have too stuff like a great reference to the differences between the games from the golden age of the arcade and the modern HD ones such as CALL OF DUTY and GEARS OF WAR. The premise itself is really nice: the villain of a game (Ralph – voice of John C. Reilly) is simply tired of his daily job and wants to become the hero! As a movie about video games, 'Ralph' is definitely a blast. But as a whole, well, it's not something annoying and noisy like 'Transylvania' but nevertheless it's an average, just-to- see-once, flick. It ain't a gem like, you know, almost every one from the catalog of Pixar. *Watched it on 11 November, 2012",7,0,1,17 November 2012
To Rome With Love," Huge disappointment; one of Allen's worst for my money
","Do you remember the last shot of Quentin Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS? That part with Brad Pitt's character sort of echoing Tarantino's very own feelings towards his film by saying something like 'I think this is my masterpiece'. With one of the last scenes of TO ROME WITH LOVE I felt that its director (master) Woody Allen was also talking about his own film – Allen knows his latest isn't a fine one, and is like he just don't care since he has experienced some worse criticism before. Usually, I'm a fan of the Woody Allen pictures that many people hate (HOLLYWOOD ENDING, for instance) so pretty much, out of the 30+ films directed by Allen that I have seen, I would rank this one at the bottom – with the exception of YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER I really can't think in another truly disappointing Allen. TO ROME WITH LOVE is certainly kind of special since it features Allen's first performance in 6 years. I always liked to believe that he wasn't ever coming back to acting, and not because I thought he was done but just because of the surprising and funny ending of his character in SCOOP (2006). But he is back and his character here does go for the self-referential thing: this character is a retired music producer who is not satisfied at all with his days without any work. As I guess you already know, 'Rome' presents four different stories - Allen's character is part of one that has some laughs but also ridiculous stuff (that made people at the cinema laugh a lot, actually). I would say many more material here is quite ridiculous, being Roberto Benigni the unluckiest talent of the big ensemble cast (which includes the youngsters Ellen Page and Jesse Eisenberg -doing nothing spectacular- and Alec Baldwin as a omnipresent character that doesn't make much sense). Hell, let's write more about the story with Benigni. I think is the key one to say this isn't a success of a film. Allen had something to say here, especially via the part with the star of LA VITA È BELLA ('Rome' marks Benigni's first performance since 2005, by the way). He is not saying anything new but nevertheless is a nice statement on fame and the media. However we have not only Benigni being totally wasted but also material that doesn't quite belong here – yes, I get the point but that doesn't mean I enjoyed a series of repetitive and mostly unfunny scenes that made me think something like 'what the heck is this?' Ultimately, the film also fails when it comes to make of Rome a place to die for; I mean, you can make a place look like heaven or the complete opposite, but you better do something memorable especially if you have the name of the place in the title! In recent memory, the (bad) film EAT PRAY LOVE did a whole lot more for Italy than this one (to tell the truth, Allen's film don't do a thing for Rome) – with that film I wanted to be there, eating lots of great food! So yes, this one is pretty mediocre in every aspect (with the exception of Penelope Cruz, who does a fine don't-do-a-thing-besides-showing-your-sexiness kind of work). *Watched it on 20 July, 2012",5,3,6,21 July 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Not entirely successful; still I can't wait to watch the second part!
","Boy oh boy, it's been already eleven years since Peter Jackson gave new cinematic life to the work of J.R.R. Tolkien. For mere nostalgia, I'm really happy that since this year December is again synonymous of the Middle Earth (well, the last film is actually set for a July 2014 release). So the first part of the trilogy that precedes THE LORD OF THE RINGS (2001-2003) is finally here, after the 2010 departure of Guillermo del Toro and a long production. One of the first thoughts I had after experiencing THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, in its HFR 3D format (48fps), is that del Toro would have done something closer to the brilliance of 'Lord of the Rings'. Don't get me wrong, Peter Jackson is obviously a great director; from his early 16 mm guerrilla filmmaking, totally influenced by Lloyd Kaufman and Troma, to his transition to big budget, high technology territory. With 'Hobbit 1' (I'm calling it this way to simplify things) Jackson is moving forward in technology matter. But I don't think this time the results are entirely successful. The first minutes of this movie make evident why Lloyd Kaufman himself always goes for 35 mm and why Quentin Tarantino is thinking in becoming only writer now that almost everything in cinema is digital. No other movie so far has left it as clear as this one did. A movie in a movie theater no longer looks like a movie, as simple as that. For moments I felt I was watching one of those videos that appear when you're about to begin a video game mission; in other moments I thought that the movie hasn't been yet edited and that I was watching a 'behind the scenes'. If you wanna find out how a HFR movie looks, just find your LORD OF THE RINGS DVDs or Blu-Rays and check out the behind the scenes features.Jackson said that it only takes time for you to get used to HFR. But I don't think so, it isn't a matter of get used to it. It's just that there are some shots that do look amazing and really beautiful; some elements did get benefice from this technology. The character Gollum, for instance, looks better than ever. And to talk about a great Gollum is, without a doubt, a clear indication that 'Hobbit 1' ain't only a synonymous of bad news. In fact, Gollum alone makes this worth watching stuff. After his brilliant participation in the reboot RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (Rupert Wyatt, 2011), Andy Serkis returns to the character that gave him immortality, and he simply steals the movie with that classic insanity of his – in this part Bilbo Baggins meets Gollum and the ring.The story may be taking us to the days when Bilbo was young but it's very similar to what we can find in the first 'Lord of the Rings' movie. A clear mission; a fellowship ready to accomplish it (this time mostly composed by dwarfs); Gandalf the gray present for the wisdom and magic; and an innocent hobbit leaving his Shire to see for the very first time the dark side, full of orcs and goblins, of the Middle Earth. Everything is here and is shown in a period of almost three hours too; though I felt them as one and a half hour, which is again an indication that, no matter what, Jackson gave us some good entertainment. 'Hobbit 1' ain't a brilliant masterpiece; it doesn't have battles with moments as memorable and meaningful as the death of Boromir from the last part of 'Fellowship of the Ring' (nor characters that stand out from the rest; I'm talking in specific of the dwarfs, hoping that they get better in the next movies). Also, I can't ignore all the visual problems already mentioned. But nevertheless it's a movie that accomplishes its main goal of leaving the viewer with desires of watching the second part of the new Peter Jackson trilogy about the world of Tolkien. *Watched it on 14 December, 2012",7,2,11,16 December 2012
Before Sunset," Waltz in Paris
","Ethan Hawke is Richard Linklater. That may sound sort of weird but let's see: Richard Linklater's personal experiences were the inspiration for Before Sunrise (apparently he met a woman at a toy shop in 1989, from the IMDb trivia: the idea for the movie came from a night Richard Linklater spent walking around Philadelphia with Amy, a woman he met). Of course the fictionalized version ended being the film so we can say Hawke, as Jesse, is Linklater but also, and this take us to Before Sunset, Jesse will do or better said did just what Linklater did that is fictionalize a personal experience. I love the way Before Sunset begins: Jesse is in Paris at a book store talking about his book, a fictionalized version of a personal experience, when he met a French woman on a train and spent the night with her. Linklater may had to answer the same questions the journalists asks to Jesse, they wonder if the book is based on personal experiences, they wonder about what happened to its characters so when Jesse confirms the fact that his book is based on a personal experience the question is 'Jesse, did you see her again?'. So in the film there are characters that wonder the same that us the people who is seeing the film, and we only see few but Jesse's bock is actually is best- seller yet we are the only ones who will know everything yet this sequel ain't any kind of conclusion, actually here we don't see plans, there's nothing like a 'how about six months?' thing.Some weeks ago I finally saw one of the most acclaimed films from Linklater, 'Sunrise' certainly, and as I wrote in my IMDb comment of it took me a lot to finally check it out since I always had the feeling it was not going to be really my cup of tea but after seeing it I was mostly glad, it isn't really a masterpiece for me or one of my favourites from Linklater but I sure like it. Its sequel, released back in 2004, on the contrary was an instant 'wanted film', and in the end I liked more this one, not really much more but overall if someday I watch again just a half of the 3 or so hours romance from Linklater I would like to watch again this half, however I don't see that day in a near future.",Null,0,0,4 August 2009
The Transporter," The Professional Transporter
","Back in the year 2003 I saw for the first time the English actor Jason Statham in the magnificent film 'Snatch' (2000) and soon after in 'Look, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' (1998) so in consequence I became in a big fan of Statham. I can't remember well the release of 'The Transporter' in Mexico but I do remember when the sequel was released, mostly for the many advertisements when it was premiered in cable TV. I really feel desires to watch them but for some strange reasons I never watch them but I do watch 'Crank' (2006) and it was a big disappointment to me so after that I never look out for the transporter filmsuntil the last weekend that I found the DVD of this one in a great price so I decide to get it and watch it.The film is about Frank (Statham) who is an ex-military that now lives in France and works as a transporter of anything, of course illegal things too. He has three personal rules for his job: 1. 'Never change the deal' 2. 'No names' 3. 'Never open the package'. But when he his hired for transport a kidnapped girl named Lai (Shu Qi) he broke the rule number 3 so his life is in real danger and suddenly he enters in the criminal world and becomes the only hope for four hundred people being smuggled.I really love the first part of this film, for me Frank is a really great character of course because of his interesting job and also because of the very impressive way that he works, being a real and cool professional. The first sequence is great showing his great abilities for drive his BMW and his great precision for save the problems of his clients, only if you don't break any rule. Later when he meets Lai is when the real action begins and that's all.In making-of featurette of the DVD, Statham and company claim that Cory Yuen is the very best for action sequences. For me the action sequences in this film are good, with the great fact that Statham did every of his difficult sequences, but definitely I have seen better stuff.Conclusion: I really enjoyed this film, is just great and very cool the character of Jason Statham and the 90 minutes goes amazingly fast. I also liked the strange combination of three different languages so I recommend this film to anyone, mostly fans of the genre, who wants to enjoy 90 minutes of pure entertainment.Region 4 DVD: It's actually really good for the low price. Contains commentaries by Statham and the producer, extended versions of three fight sequences and like I said a making-of featurette that is good but very short. Well soon I'm going to get part 2.",Null,0,0,16 April 2008
Revolutionary Road," 'Day after day, love turns gray Night after night, we pretend its all right but I have grown older and you have grown colder, and nothing is very much fun, anymore'
","Just last year I finally saw for the very first time the debut film of Sam Mendes, American Beauty, and certainly I was expecting a masterpiece but now I can say that American Beauty is a good but overrated debut of Mendes. Basically I wasn't sure if I wanted to check Mendes' fourth film, Revolutionary Road, but now I'm glad I was invited to see it, certainly I had a better second experience with a Sam Mendes film not to mention with a film with both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet playing the main characters. Here DiCaprio gives another remarkable performance (not to mention Winslet) as Frank, a young man who meet his wife April (certainly played by Kate) at a party, who fought in the WWII and who works at Knox Business Machines, the same company that has Frank's father for 30 years as an employee. Frank and April, better known as the Wheelers are for all the people a beautifully perfect couple. When we meet April we, and Frank, knew that she was an actress, now she is a housewife, a mother of a girl and a boy, two kids that we barely see. Settle down, unhappy moments for our two main characters. We have in another couple (played by Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour) and in Helen (Kathy Bates) the closest persons to the Wheelers. That couple is the 'normal' imperfect one, good persons but apparently not as special as the Wheelers and Helen thinks nothing but the same about the Wheelers, she admires them, she really likes them, she think they are special. Is quite interesting to see the reactions of these people when they know about the plans of our young and perfect couple, plans that give hopes to Frank and April, hopes and happiness. The point of doing those plans to feel again, their plans are to move to Paris, France, she will work, he will stay at home to find himself, to find what he really wants. Then is the same routine, Frank has to take the train to get to the office and stuff but there's something waiting, something planned, they feel special. We have a character that appears only two times, his mother says that he is at a mental institution and that he is an intellectual. Since his mother is Helen he certainly had heard many things about the perfect Wheelers, curious that when he finally meet them is when they announce to Helen (and to her husband  played by Richard Easton) that they are not going to continue living in Revolutionary Road. So John (Michael Shannon), the mentioned intellectual son of Helen, knows what means for his parents that the Wheelers are leaving the country and for both Frank and April he is the only one who understand them, who understand why they want to leave Revolutionary Road. So the first time we see John is basically an uncomfortable moment for his parents but not really for the Wheelers, John ends being the only character in our story that not only says exactly what he thinks but also whose words are true at least for the Wheelers. John meet with the Wheelers a couple of times, in both for the Wheelers he says the truth yet the reaction of Frank after hearing John is not the same at all in both moments. Famous critic Roger Ebert wrote this John Lennon phrase at the beginning of his review for this film: 'Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans'. Here of course things happen to them after April says her idea to Frank and he says 'OK', the unplanned stuff certainly comes, Frank wasn't waiting for something but this something came, now for him their Paris can be not in France but there in their country and not exactly because there is a Paris, Texas. We see both Frank and April cheating on the other, only Frank will confess this to April, why? with what purpose? He confessed his affair, an affair that started in the day of his 30th birthday, that day he came home and saw April and his children, they certainly congratulated him, was his day and the day he had sex with a work partner (played by Zoe Kazan), by then the Wheelers were still for the people the perfect young couple. When I entered yesterday to the movie theater to see this film I had in mind that this was one of the five films nominated for the best picture Oscar, you know the poster of Revolutionary Road is similar to the one of The Reader but anyway I recommend you this new Sam Mendes drama, certainly the performances of those who leaved behind Titanic are enough to say that this is a worth watching film. Now checking I know that Revolutionary Road will be 'fighting' for 3 Oscars, I go for the Joker.",Null,3,5,4 February 2009
28 Days Later...," People killing people
","With the intention of save a group of chimpanzees, a group of young persons enter to a secret laboratory were accidentally release a virus called 'rage'; that virus cause anger and quickly is in all London. 28 days later... Jim wakes after a coma and see that London is desolate so with 3 more persons, he tries to survive in a land of 'infected' people.This is the plot of this good film in which Danny Boyle tries to recreate the 'zombie' genre with all the 'school' of George A. Romero.About the film: i really like the scenery that Boyle put, i mean to see a desolate London is really scary and is the perfect scenery for a 'zombie' story. The way that the story is told is nothing but great, is like two different parts; when Jim meet Selena is a scary part because she tells him that he must kill any infected person even his best friend, but the best part in the story is after Jim and mates find those soldiers that suppose have the cure; is like the enemy was always with us before the virus.Well, the cast is good and the best thing is the visual part....really amazing. And Boyle is great, for me his best work since 'Trainspotting' that is one of the most important independent films ever.Conclusion: must see for horror fans. DVD: nice but i have the single version with few bonus.",Null,1,2,12 December 2007
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Drop the leash
","While I'm a part of the minority who just f****** liked Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES (considering the hate towards that movie, this is like the bravest thing I will ever write here!), I do want to start this comment with a very small comparison between RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES and Burton's picture; a comparison that, obviously, places Rupert Wyatt's film (did someone knew this director before 2011?) as the superior modern version of 'Apes'. And is all related to the 'sometimes the simpler the better' kind of thing. ROTPOTA is as very simple as effective, awesome and soulful. I guess the very best thing about it is that it left me wanting MUCH MORE; it's a masterpiece of a beginning in a film series, and I just can't wait to see part two. There's nothing confusing going on here. It goes simply with three main things: evolution in a species, coming of age and revolution (its tagline 'evolution becomes revolution' is quite accurate!). The key thing is certainly the coming of age part of the story; is when the whole thing becomes soulful and when you get to know the main character: Andy Serkis' Caesar. That someone will not LOVE Serkis' Caesar (or any of the other apes actually – I personally loved the crazy-looking one that perfectly knows everything related with laboratories) is something I just can't think in. Or that someone will not care about him. Such a perfect, and quite bad-ass, lead character (and, at the beginning, very cute too! Your girlfriend will love him!). And what else can I say about the work of Serkis? What else can I say about Weta? What they did here is simply a masterwork. Hope they get the Oscar for visual effects! Last year I took a not-very-famous movie tour in San Francisco, California. They took us to some locations of movies like DIRTY HARRY, and of course to the quintessential San Francisco landmark: the Golden Gate Bridge. Hands down, this movie has the necessary to become a sort of classic San Francisco movie. There's the really nice use of, for instance, the famous cable cars. I think ROTPOTA is closer than Burton's movie (so yes, here's another small comparison!) to create an iconic image that can function as an equivalent to the beyond spectacular ending of the original PLANET OF THE APES (even when the ending of Burton's one did go for the shocking element). As Caesar is unforgettable, many of the scenes are too; going back to the San Francisco element, the use of the Golden Gate Bridge is fantastic. Is there better action on the bridge than this? I don't think so. Yes, as an action picture, ROTPOTA it's just freakin' awesome! And it's, easily, one of my favorites of 2011. *Watched it on January 28 and February 02, 2012 (Blu-Ray). Previously on October 02, 2011 (cinema).",10,1,2,1 February 2012
Cars," Totally awesome, one of my favourites from Pixar!
","After finally seen John Lasseter's fourth, and most recent, feature film, the 2006 Cars, I finally can say that I have seen each and every Pixar feature film. With the exception of Toy Story 2 and Cars since the 1998 A Bug's Life until the 2009 Up I saw all of them on the big screen (not sure if I saw Toy Story on the big screen but is a fact that I saw it, just like Toy Story 2, many times on VHS) but anyway, I saw Cars for the very first time complete last Thursday on Blu-ray (visually was, obviously, a delight), before I had seen some parts on TV, like the part when the protagonist, race car Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), is sleeping while his driver, the truck Mack (the detail of the gimme cap is just fantastic), takes him to California for the race that McQueen will have to win to be for the very first time the champion of the Piston Cup. I had seen that part at least a couple of times on TV, is a big plot point that will lead Lighting McQueen simply to a new life. There's a certain thing with the hero of this movie",10,0,0,21 June 2009
Django Unchained," Best picture of 2012
","The way Quentin Tarantino begins his little yet very rich essay on Sergio Corbucci (published by Fangoria magazine on its January 2013 edition) could very well be a perfect beginning for a review/essay/article on DJANGO UNCHAINED, Tarantino's fist feature film since INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009). 'Reimagining the Western genre for his own ends, Sergio Corbucci used cowboy pictures, and his vast knowledge of them -not to mention his expertise on Japanease samurai pictures- to explore and examine the evils inherent in fascism'; if we change the name Sergio Corbucci for Quentin Tarantino, and the word 'fascism' for 'slavery', we would have a great resume of what DJANGO UNCHAINED is. In his essay, Tarantino talks mainly about the great violence and cruelty featured in the work of Corbucci – whether DJANGO UNCHAINED is Tarantino's most violent film or not is a matter of perception (KILL BILL could be my other choice, but there will be people who think that INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is or even RESERVOIR DOGS for its ending and that famous torture scene), but without a doubt this is his most cruel movie. Forget every other performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, even his brilliant collaborations with Martin Scorsese. This is his very best work so far, and it's a real shame that he's not even nominated for the Oscar. His villain Calvin Candie is the pure representation of that cruelty Tarantino found in Corbucci's world; Candie is a young man who was born and raised in the plantations, who is used to everything related with slavery and therefore bored, so he finds the fun he needs in the Mandingo fighting business: black slaves who fight to the death. DJANGO UNCHAINED turns to be a brutal slavery movie; if INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (with the exception of one sequence) didn't show the brutality of the Nazis to the Jews (with tons of films about the holocaust it wasn't necessary), here we do see the tortures and all of those slavery issues that apparently are often ignored by American movies. The commentary is certainly strong (Samuel L. Jackson and his great character Stephen is a proof of that), but this being Tarantino in his purest form, the hilarious moments are constantly present. Tarantino plays with the way white racists are (and with the classic look of the KKK) – in one particular scene, for instance, we see Django (Jamie Foxx) as a free man, riding a horse, and the plantation owner 'Big Daddy' (little but brilliant performance by Don Johnson) can't easily explain to one of his female slaves how she has to treat Django (his guest): yes, he ain't no slave but neither is white! For the second consecutive time, Tarantino took the name of an old Italian film, focused on a genre and on a violent and sad chapter in the history of humanity. In 'Basterds' he had the presence (and blessing) of Enzo G. Castellari (director of the original), so it was obvious that Tarantino was going to seek the same with the original Django Franco Nero (Corbucci passed away in 1990). Nero's cameo, if you know the context, is quite memorable; otherwise is probable that, specifically, the scene between him and Tarantino's Django feels a bit out of place. But the presence of Nero is only one of the many elements that indicate the great determination Tarantino had in order to not disappoint his fans and himself with his first official Western.The director has had Ennio Morricone music in more than one of his films (KILL BILL, DEATH PROOF and 'Basterds'), but never before *original music*. With the tune 'Ancora Qui', 'Unchained' became in yet another Western scored by Morricone – at this point is almost unnecessary to say that Tarantino perfectly knows those details that make a modern movie something glorious for the old fans of the respective genre. As a pure Western, 'Unchained' offers some sort of alternate version of the beginning of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, in which the Good and the Ugly are a bounty hunting team. Here we have Django and the German Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz, who once again shines and make the Americans read some subtitles). Jamie Foxx is genius – I never thought Tarantino was going to do again a similar scene to that from KILL BILL in which Bill is by a bonfire telling a story to the Bride. Much less with both Foxx and Waltz; Foxx's Django shows some innocence, and obviously he's too a mythical figure from the Old West (the Deep South really) that won't disappoint anyone seeking for a violent Spaghetti Western. This is the first Tarantino movie with a straight love story – in KILL BILL love was certainly a constant motivation, but here his protagonist Django is an ex-slave whose one and only goal is to rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave of Candie's plantation in Mississippi. Tarantino doesn't show any kind of fear and he is making from a Western, with the slavery thing as background, a fable with a princess that waits for her hero. As any great film, 'Unchained' was much better the second time I watched it an I have no doubt Tarantino has a new MASTERPIECE; with great action, tension, music, brilliant performances, dialogs, sequences and decisions (mixing songs by 2Pac and James Brown for the great climax, for example – this left me a bit confused the first time). Best movie of 2012!*Watched it on 17 & 18 January, 2013",10,2,7,20 January 2013
Bolt," Hollywood dog
","A Californian dog will learn to be like a normal dog in this film, a family Disney film that I saw with some familiars yesterday. I wasn't aware of the fact that Bolt is presented in 3-D then was a surprise to find that at my local cinema Bolt is been screened only in 3-D, certainly more expensive but Bolt absolutely worth the money. Passed like 2 or 3 years to see another movie in 3-D since the last time was when I saw the re-release of The Nightmare Before Christmas. Was curious the fact that yesterday I saw, for the very first time, the trailer of the up-coming Henry Selick movie Coraline but anyway, the name of the mentioned Californian dog is Bolt, nice white dog, Bolt is more specifically from Hollywood, he is the star of a TV show and not only his world is only the Hollywood studio but also he believes he has all the powers and enemies from the TV show. So Bolt is not really a dog actor, in the TV show his enemy is Dr. Calico who has two cats that does know they are part of a TV show so the basic stuff is funny, the two cats, one white and another black, have some fun. In the TV show the happy ending is always there, Bolt always saves the day, he always saves Penny and since Bolt really believes he has powers and stuff the filming goes always as planned. What happens when the ending is not happy? Bolt is worried, for him Penny is in real danger, he will be out of the studio, he will see the world. Is a great thing the character Rhino since with him now we have in Bolt a character that believes that he has all the powers and stuff of the character that he plays in the TV show and in Rhino a character that believes that the TV show is real. So Bolt will learn to be like a normal dog, certainly he never acted. The film has a message, is very entertaining, looks really nice, has those hilarious pigeons, I liked it, really liked it.",Null,1,2,22 January 2009
Hellboy," From Hell
","'In the coldest regions of space, the monstrous entities Ogdru Jahad -the Seven Gods of Chaos- slumber in their crystal prison, waiting to reclaim Earthand burn the heavens.' I wasn't and I'm not a follower of the comic book but back in 2004 I do had big desires to watch the Hellboy film so I invited my mom to the cinema since then nobody else had a big interest in the film of Guillermo del Toro (she liked it and for her was kind of cute to see the baby Hellboy). Since I found 'Hellboy' as a very enjoyable, fast paced and terrific film, it doesn't took a lot time for me to get its DVD and just after I bought it I saw the film again, now with the entire family and since then I haven't seen it again, until today. The reason is obvious, you know getting in the mood and in the context before the sequel arrives but also to finally write a comment about it. Now I found the same terrific film that I remembered, practically because its release was just 4 years ago. Anyway, as I write I wasn't and I'm not a follower of the comic book and actually I have never read any complete comic of Hellboy so I'm going to write like I would have write in 2004, I mean as somebody who is realizing about all the mythology and knowing all the characters as the film goes.The connections with our world this time are historical and involve the Nazis. The story begins in 1944 but Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) was in this 'business' since long time ago and he has already been shoot, castrated, drowned, etc but there he was with the Nazis but there was also a small squad with the Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt) that could stop those plans but they could not stop the arrival of a demon to our world, a red baby with a really big arm who found in the Professor Trevor Bruttenholm a father; here is when this action film really begins.Now there is the classic secret team with Hellboy (Ron Perlman), Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and Abraham Sapien (Doug Jones) leaded by the Professor Trevor Bruttenholm but also there is John Myers (Rupert Evans), the classic new one on the business without any experience but with a good heart. Practically Rasputin and his partners (including the terrific character Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, played by Ladislav Beran) are back with the same objective and with a vengeance; Hellboy looks great and during the film he will be fighting with this Sammael aka Sammy in some great action sequences to finally be face to face with Rasputin and with his -apparent- destiny.Cast: Perlman was the greatest choice in the cast and I'm just glad that both Guillermo del Toro and Mignola really fight to make Perlman Hellboy since the studio wanted the assh*le of Vin Diesel (somewhere I read that they were giving more budget to the sequel if Nicolas Cage replace Perlman, f*ck you said Guillermo del Toro). The great John Hurt is terrific as usual, the beautiful Selma Blair is also quite good and Doug Jones is perfect too as he was latter as the Fauno.Conclusion: Great action, terrific story, fun stuff (thanks to Hellboy's attitude, sometimes punk rocker sometimes jealous) and after all a terrific comic book film. I'm more than ready for more so let's go to the cinema friends!!Region 4 DVD: the special edition with two discs is very complete with a lot of great material including a -fantastic- 2 hours documentary (see Del Toro crying in front of a beautiful model of Abraham Sapien because 'I'm ugly and fat' and 'he's a f*cking god'), commentaries by Guillermo del Toro and Mignola, introduction to the film by Del Toro and to the disc 2 by Selma Blair and so many others to list them all. Great DVD!",9,0,0,11 July 2008
I Am Legend," I am what i listen. I am Bob Marley
","The cure of the cancer is discover but the next thing we know is that a virus exterminated most of the humanity and the few survivors are a kind of mutants except Robert Neville(Will Smith) who is the last survivor of New York. He and his dog are trying to found other survivors without the virus and to find a cure.This is the main plot of this typical Hollywood film that is the third film based on the 1954 novel 'I Am Legend' and also based unofficial in the 2002 British film '28 Days Later'. So the plot is nothing new but still i have the hope that this film could be like '28 Days Later', in the way that it offers from an old story a new kind of film never released before. But this film let me down. Since the very first scene with Will Smith this film start to let me down, i mean that scene is like a commercial of Mustang and well in fact it was because the Mustang doesn't appear again. Well the cast is just OK, i'm not a fan of Smith and in this he is nothing special. The visual part of the film and the music are amazing, to see New York desolate is disturbing and in that way the film is good and i'm a big fan of Bob Marley so i enjoy listening 'Three Little Birds', 'Stir it Up' and 'Redemption Song'. Also the dialog of Smith about Marley is terrific and i big tribute to a unique musician with a big soul. So for me those are the best things of this film, but the weak plot, the stupid character of Smith who could live very good in New York in consequence of weak enemies that aren't as disturbing as the enemies in the British film, are enough to make this a big disappointment.Conclusion: i don't regret of watch this film because it was entertaining but i want to say that if you haven't watch this film you better save your money,wait to watch it on TV and watch again '28 Days Later'. 5 out of 10",5,1,3,20 January 2008
School of Rock," Dewey Finn may not be the God of Rock but he just f****** rocks trying!
","Richard Linklater couldn't use, back in 1993, Led Zeppelin's classic, and totally mind blowing, tune for his film Dazed and Confused (still a great soundtrack certainly, and if Wikipedia is to be believed 'while Jimmy Page agreed Robert Plant refused') but here in this Linklater film, The School of Rock, we have not only a Zeppelin classic (I just saw for the very first time the video with Jack Black that was sent to Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones! Lords of Rock Led Zeppelin!!!) but also classics by such great bands like the Doors, the Who, Cream, Deep Purple, the Ramones, AC/DC, etc. The School of Rock, written by Mike White (who also plays a not that minor character. He is all right but certainly he ain't a really good actor), is certainly Jack Black's show, and is like a for hire film for Linklater in the vein of his 2005 Bad News Bears (a remake of the 1976 The Bad News Bears, which I haven't seen) however comparing one film with the other, I mean The School of Rock and Bad News Bears, I can say there's a really notable difference, The School of Rock is a fast-paced, hilarious and highly re-watchable Hollywood entertainment, you can forgive its typical elements, that is predictable and stuff.And as I think you already know Tenacious D member Jack Black is Dewey Finn, and like Jack Black himself the main character (Dewey Finn) of this film may not be the God of Rock but for sure he is a good guitar player, yet basically at the very beginning of the film each time Black scores by making us laugh Dewey Finn is one step closer to stop being part of the rock band No Vacancy, one step closer to be basically broke and without the dream of rock 'n' roll. However at one point we are going to enjoy part of a classic by Cream (I doubt that a rock fan doesn't get at least a little excited when the riff of 'Sunshine of Your Love' begins), is like the rebirth of Dewey (though at that point Dewey is known at his workplace as Ned Schneebly) after finding a new hope in order to fight in the upcoming battle of the bands. It will be kids hearing for the very first time about the Doors, Hendrix, etc., hell it would have been really cool to have checking out the vocal solo from Pink Floyd's 'The Great Gig in the Sky' instead of some math problems as homework or having as a class the history of rock instead of history of the world, don't you think? And this thing (Dewey not only pretends to be his best friend Ned Schneebly, who is a substitute teacher, but also will use 'his' students for the battle of bands by telling them is a secret school project) certainly will bring troubles, of course eventually everybody will know the truth about Dewey and of course the kids will stay with their rock teacher. And is like you have to do what the principal (Joan Cusack is terrific. 'Well I went today, maybe I will go again... tomorrow!') and the parents of the kids will do, sort of: for once forget about everything else and just enjoy the show, enjoy the hilarious show of Jack Black, enjoy the show of the talented kids, enjoy this Linklater film!",9,0,0,25 July 2009
Cars 2," Just about the very first Pixar movie that IS NOT a great one
","'Pixar itself did a perfect example of the typical uninteresting sequel with CARS 2'; I wrote that like a week ago to make a point for my TOY STORY 3 commentary, based on what I thought it was going to be my one and only viewing of CARS 2 (that happened like a year ago, on the big screen certainly). However last Monday I joined my girlfriend and her little nephews, unexpectedly, for a DVD viewing of it. So, do I still think this is an uninteresting sequel? The answer is both yes and no. Yes because the plot doesn't have the usual amount of imagination from a Pixar film; and no just because I had a nice time watching it, it was amusing and it wouldn't be fair to say it's a complete bad movie. It's just that being Pixar, and being the sequel to one of my favorite movies from them (not to mention the fact that John Lasseter himself directed it), it SHOULD have been a complete winner. The main problem of CARS 2 is its hollow story; we all know that Pixar knows how to deliver great stuff from a very basic idea, but this time that basic idea is, to begin with, not very good: it's the kind of classic going-in-a-world-tour material, with Lightning McQueen going to Japan, Italy and England for some car racing tour. While I haven't seen the actual film (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT) I do have seen three movies of that franchise and I recall thinking while watching the trailer for 'Tokyo Drift' that they were just going to do the same thing but now in Tokyo (being that Tokyo element the main attraction). Here the problem is that nothing is quite exciting once we begin to go with our main characters to those countries; it looks great, to be fair, but for instance Lighting McQueen's participation is reduced to basically nothing memorable thanks to this repetitive thing. The main change of CARS 2 is that now Mater is the main character. It's his film basically and he becomes the protagonist of the part of this sequel that has a James Bond element, with spy cars, British intelligence, Mater being confused as an American spy car and stuff. It's funny material, I must say, and clearly the reason why I said that I had a good time watching it. Hell, I can't deny that I was way more interested in it than the kids I was with! Anyway, CARS 2 is pretty much, and sadly, the very first Pixar movie that IS NOT great. *Watched it (again) on 18 June, 2012",Null,0,1,23 June 2012
Gran Torino," 1972 Gran Torino
","Two days ago and before I went to see Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino on the big screen I was seeing the bonus material from the DVD of Classic Albums: Pink Floyd - The Making of 'The Dark Side of the Moon'. We have some short videos with Roger Waters and one is titled 'Waters' World View', in it Roger says: 'that's something I always had, when a was a teenager, when I was the chairman of the YCND in Cambridge when I was 15 years oldif you've been given the I think gift of having that perspective you don't lose it and I suspecta member of the Ku Klux KlanI think is likely that you go on, wanting to lynch people forever, maybe not, maybe I shouldn't say that, maybe there's an optimistic side of me that feels that not just individuals but authorities are capable of rehabilitation'. In Gran Torino Clint Eastwood did what will be his last performance and he is just terrific as Walt Kowalski, veteran of the Korean War who now is practically the only American, or maybe one of the few, living in the neighborhood, for him is not a trouble to go out with his rifle when his Hmong neighbors are in his lawn. In a South Park episode there's this thing that when a Muslim boy is the new student Eric Cartman is immediately thinking 'terrorist' and Cartman goes on certainly without any reason to think that but just because the boy is Muslim. The big thing is that when Cartman alerts the police (and I think even Bush) they actually end avoiding a possible attack so in the end is like 'after all it was the racism of Cartman what saved the day'. I'm writing this because there's this part in Gran Torino when one of Walt's neighbors, Thao (Bee Vang), is being bothered by his cousin (Doua Moua) and his cousin's gang and the whole problem ends when Walt goes out with a loaded riffle. Walt added another reason to dislike Thao, apart of because Thao is Chinese, when he caught him trying to steal his AMAZING 1972 Gran Torino, Walt dislike Thao's family, and his own family actually, but after the incident when he made that Thao's cousin stop trying to persuade Thao to join his gang Walt became a hero to the neighborhood, certainly Walt just wanted the gooks out of his lawn but he saved Thao. Gran Torino begins when Walt's wife just died, now he will be alone and that worry his two sons since they know how their father is however and of course that doesn't really worry Walt. You can imagine Walt's relation with Mitch (Brian Haley), one of his sons, if I write that Mitch works for a Japanese automaker (Walt worked for the Ford Motor Company) plus Mitch's daughter has piercings and stuff. In short, when Walt dies his two sons, and their respective families, won't inherit Walt's house and 1972 Gran Torino. Walt never found the way to be a true father and certainly he regrets that as other things from his past as a soldier, from the time when he earned medals for killing. But Walt will feel something new, he will find something and he will find it with the people that he never intended to have any kind of relation with. Thao's sister Sue (Ahney Her) is the one who will take Walt with her family, a new culture for Walt and is all part of an extremely entertaining film, now with Walt and Thao doing stuff together, a feel good part of the film (just hilarious how Walt talks with his Italian American pal and that part when Walt brings Thao to the barbershop just like when Thao presents himself with his future boss are just fantastic!). Despite rating Gran Torino with a full 10 and Changeling with 9.5/10 I actually think Changeling is a superior film yet Gran Torino is now for me a new personal favourite. Actually if you see both Changeling and Gran Torino it does feel like we have two complete opposite films from Eastwood, Gran Torino for most of its time is a feel good movie with a lot of fun. Anyway, 2008 was a terrific year for Clint, his last performance is very memorable, his 1972 Gran Torino is a beauty (and will be in good hands), do yourself a favor and see both Changeling and Gran Torino.",10,2,9,29 March 2009
Shrek the Third," Where is that Shrek?????
","I saw Shrek the third yesterday will a full cinema in the father's day in Mexico city. I was very exciting about this film because the others two are great. First with the cinema full is very hard to find ticket and also to find a parking lot but well is Shrek 3 i was thinking.Finally i saw it and well what the F*ck? Where is that Shrek of the first film, yes the ogre, the arrogant, the malice, the one that live always angry in his marsh and the one that do anything just for his own interests. Also in the second film is that Shrek, a little less but still the film is very good.Other thing that i don't like is the short during of the film, only like 1 hour and 20 minutes.I put 7/10 just because the puss in the boots and the donkey, yes this characters are still strong and with great gags.......the puss in the boots is maybe the best character of the second and definitely of the third. Othe good aspect is that Antonio Banderas put his voice into the original version and into the Mexican version because the voices in the Mexican version are just crap. Finally i have to say that in the next film please put the original director back for the good of the film and for the good of the director because he do a crap film: Narnia.Well better don't do Shrek 4 because now Shrek is Father!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",7,3,4,18 June 2007
The Hurt Locker," One thing and one thing only
","Last night, the night before the big event of Hollywood, I finally had the chance to watch Kathryn Bigelow's very acclaimed film, The Hurt Locker. It was my introduction to the work of 'king of the world's' ex wife (a bit about the Oscars: I only watched half of the 10 Best Picture nominees, Up, Inglourious Basterds, Avatar, District 9 and The Hurt Locker. My personal favourite is 'Basterds', District 9 after but very close both The Hurt Locker and Up all of these are truly great films to enjoy more than a single time, but I'll bet that my least favourite of those 5, certainly the extremely overrated Avatar, will give the 'king of the world' another reason to think he is the greatest human being alive). I'm mentioning this because I was quite surprised, after watching The Hurt Locker certainly, to find out that Bigelow also directed a film like the 1991 Point Break. I mean, I have yet to watch Point Break (by the way, can't wait to check out Strange Days) but based on what I've heard, I imagine that it is just a great example of a dumb action movie for the male teens (maybe the only reason why I would watch it, aside of to watch another Bigelow film, is because the Chili Peppers, or at least Anthony Kiedis, appear in it!). The tagline of Point Break is '100% Pure Adrenaline', pretty much perfect tagline for a Die Hard sort of rip-off (again, I'm just guessing based on what I've heard). The Hurt Locker is a film dealing with the adrenaline (the quote that opens the film: 'The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug') subject however it is not a film that should be targeted as a '100% Pure Adrenaline' adventure, it's a little too clever and fascinating for that this is, simply, a very tense film. Because of that fact I think many will find here a slow film. The Hurt Locker doesn't have much of a plot: we have our setting: 30 or so days before the change of the rotation, the EOD unit that we will follow loses one of its members. Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is the replacement and quickly he makes us think in the quote that opens the film. Essentially we just watch the EOD working, hence I say the film doesn't have much of a plot, however each work of the EOD is like an universe with many emotions present, with tension, each time we see these guys (James joined Sergeant Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge) we just can't be calm and we just can't get our eyes away of the screen.",Null,1,4,7 March 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," 'long you live and high you fly, and smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry, and all you touch and all you see, is all your life will ever be'
","So the most important awards for the Americans are right on the corner and that means that in commercial cinemas here in Mexico City interesting films, well at least on the paper, will be released before the ceremony takes place. Last Friday came finally to city both the new David Fincher feature film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and the first part of Steven Soderbergh's take on the revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara The Argentine. On the paper both looked really interesting to me, finally in 2009 I really wanted to go to the cinema to check some specific picture and not just the one that was going to be showed right away. On Friday I went to see Fincher's and on Saturday Soderbergh's. With Fincher's I was there more or less because of him unlike with Soderbergh's since The Argentine was going to be my very first Soderbergh film. Anyway, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has a fine cast, certainly a fine, really big budget and a really interesting story, after all I liked the film, found marvelous things, very interesting and complex parts yet I think of Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, this last is definitely my least favourite and certainly I have yet to watch (and I hope to enjoy) Alien³, The Game and Panic Room. Overrated, fine, perfect adjective for this film. The story is interesting, a fine love story, there are parts that are more than memorable, really worked to create a marvelous love story. Benjamin Button and Daisy, certain points in their love story, as I guess you know Benjamin born and he was not really a normal baby, he born and he was already old. He was certainly just a kid and he enjoyed the time with another child, with Daisy, they relation as friends was not allowed. These two will certainly meet again, they will have a normal relation, is again interesting when their daughter born, is great because it lead us again to an interesting moment, they know their love is impossible but the love of each one to the other is forever. Now is more the love of a mother the love of Daisy.Overlong, another fine, another perfect adjective for this film. At one point Daisy was in Paris and he suffered a really bad accident. Why not say that, just that? But instead we have the explanation of certain things that happened, things that could change the fact that now Daisy suffer in a hospital. Anyway, many write about Forrest Gump (I remembered the 2005 version of King Kong) as they write that this is the very best work of Fincher and Brad Pitt. For me this is not the best work neither of Fincher, Pitt and Cate Blanchett and if you talk about awards, more specifically about Oscars I can say that Benicio deserves more after the recognition in Cannes yet he doesn't need any award.",6,3,6,21 January 2009
Donnie Brasco," One of my favourites Gangster films
","I love crime films so i really want see this one. I'm wrong or Donnie Brasco wasn't a very successful film, well at here in Mexico this film is not very know an also i could find the Region 1 DVD in a very good price, like $10. I mean, you couldn't find the Region 4 DVD because i think it doesn't exist so those films that only could find in Region 1 DVD are very expensive, like $50, so Donnie Brasco is not very famous or very commercial.Well about the film, i love it, i really don't know what to expect but i always think that it wasn't an excellent film but i was very wrong. The story is just great, Johnny Depp is Joe Pistone an undercover FBI agent and Donnie Brasco is his character in the mission to find 'Lefty'(Pacino)The director instead of put a lot violence and stuff, he show to us more the relationship between Lefty and Brasco and that became a very special relation just like brothers. and makes you think that Brasco is not going to accuse Lefty. The film has a very memorable end and many memorable scenes like when Brasco tells to Lefty that his ring was a fugazi or when Brasco don't want to enter to the Asian restaurant is really great. Also the act is amazing, maybe the best of Pacino since his best days and Johnny Depp confirm that is one of the best actors of the last years. Whit roles of Michael Madsen, that plays Sonny, is not his best role but still is good and also whit the little role of Paul Giamatti(and the scene of 'forget about it' is also one of my favorites) now famous for Sideways and The Ilusionist.And all based on a true story that was based in Pistone's book. So i really love this film is now one of my favourites films about gangsters andthe DVDdeserves to be in my collection. 10/10",10,2,3,1 October 2007
Grave of the Fireflies," 'Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky'
","Recently I purchased two Isao Takahata films on DVD, I got Pom Poko and Grave of the Fireflies being this one the one of which I heard many positive things. I knew what to expect certainly, if you come here and read some reviews of Grave of the Fireflies one of the adjectives you will read more is 'heartbreaking', for me this is almost too heartbreaking to even consider to watch it again but don't get me wrong since I actually, and simply, loved Grave of the Fireflies and it is a must-see piece of animation. Japan 1945, civilians need to be ready since at any moment aeroplanes will be over their heads and then it happens, first attack we see and there we have our main characters, the siblings Seita (voice of Tsutomu Tatsumi) and Setsuko (voice of Ayano Shiraishi), almost not surviving the attack, surviving outside a bomb shelter actually. Seita has his father serving to the Navy, certainly Seita himself, just like his little sister and his mother (voice of Yoshiko Shinohara), is not only worried because the man of his house is away but also because they are not safe at all where they are. We see only once Seita and Setsuko's mother, for a reason our siblings can't go together with their mother to the bomb shelter, they won't see again their mother and we won't see in many moments Seita alone or Setsuko alone, certainly each one of them has only the other. Like a month ago or so I wrote my IMDb comment of another true must-see piece of animation, Waltz with Bashir is its English title. I put in the title of my comment a line of 'Goodbye Blue Sky', a Pink Floyd song from the brilliant 1979 album The Wall, and I will write that same line here: 'The flames are all gone, but the pain lingers on'. So in Grave of the Fireflies after the attack that results in many people dead including Seita and Setsuko's mother the flames are not gone, the bombs will continue to fall, Seita and Setsuko will be safe using a bomb shelter. At this point we already know a character that is a familiar of the siblings, we know their aunt (voice of Akemi Yamaguchi), after their mother passed away their aunt's house is the only their aunt's place is where the siblings must went so at this point at least there's some hope in the way of having someone else who cares about them, about their safety. Meanwhile the war goes on the food is less and less, at one very relevant point the aunt gets a good quantity of rice thanks to the clothes of the siblings' mother, the three enjoy a good meal. Actually in the aunt's house live another two persons, her daughter and a student, productive persons that do something for society unlike Seita and Setsuko, that's just how the aunt sees things so since Seita and Setsuko practically don't do anything during the day well they don't deserve more rice and stuff, and they won't have it. Which is interesting is that the aunt's daughter and the other guy never said a thing but anyway that was a complete change of the aunt. There are many real touching moments, from the one that gives meaning to the title to when Setsuko says to her brother that she only wants that he stay with her. But actually those moments came after Seita and Setsuko decided to live by themselves away from their aunt. There are moments in which we see the siblings maybe just for some minutes but still we see them forgetting what's going on, they enjoy the sea and is when they are enjoying a moment by playing a piano and singing when their relation with their aunt will finally end. So in an extremely difficult period for the aunt you can't have a single moment of peace, a single moment with some laughs. The aunt enters and says something like 'stop, don't you know we are in war? Is not the time to have parties, you don't have education'. She is asking to two young persons that are alone because of the war if they don't know that Japan is in war, is the last time we and the siblings see the aunt. When the war is over the siblings will not even realize about that fact, sure now war is over but their lives as they knew were over much long before, extremely touching, Grave of the Fireflies is nothing but a piece of work that you must see.",Null,2,3,25 March 2009
Brave," Just what you expect from Pixar: fun and soulful material
","I'm pretty sure you have seen already the first teaser trailer for Pixar's 2013 project MONSTERS UNIVERSITY. Pixar knows everyone will get to see many times stuff about their movies long before the actual release; I'm not sure how many times I got to see the BRAVE trailer but it even was present in the DVD of CARS 2. So thanks to the trailers and the many newspaper articles I got to see I thought I knew what BRAVE was all about. And the thing is Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman and Steve Purcell (all doing their very first Pixar feature film) gave me just what I expected: the hugely enjoyable -and visually fantastic- tale of a not very common princess, whose interests go way beyond the traditions of the kingdom (she basically needs to become a -lovely- *princess* and getting an arranged marriage is a big step for that). But actually that 'I got what I expected' thing goes only for the first part of the film. I really appreciate and love when a film totally surprises me (in a good way, certainly), and BRAVE did exactly that since Pixar didn't give almost anything away with the trailers. What we have is a movement that makes the film more marvelous and that, I dare to say, will alone turn some people off. But it's pure comedy gold - humor based on the classic behavior of a mother. The core of the film's themes is parenting, and you can relate to a lot of things. For instance the stuff with the father (the king, who is one of those that will 'fight a bear with bare hands' – I recalled the men from HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON thanks to the king and his pals) being totally rude and everything with his friends until his wife says *no more*! Who can't relate with that? BRAVE is exactly what you expect from Pixar: fun, soulful material, with memorable characters (like the hilarious almost-ignored-by-everybody redheaded triplets!). Go see it on the big screen! *Watched it on 20 July, 2012",10,5,10,22 July 2012
Evil Dead," Raining Blood!
","The awaited remake of Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD arrived with a sentence, written all over the poster: 'the most terrifying film you will ever experience'. While it's not, since there are things like MARTYRS (Pascal Laugier, 2008 – the most 'terrifying' film of the new millennium in my opinion), the gore fest that Fede Alvarez offers is one of the most satisfying horror movies in recent memory. Just like Eli Roth came with his 'godfathers' Quentin Tarantino and Peter Jackson, the young Uruguayan Alvarez arrived with the backup of Raimi and Bruce Campbell and without many experience (EVIL DEAD is his very first feature film). Alvarez ain't the disappointment that Eli Roth was with CABIN FEVER and HOSTEL, and without a doubt his next project (it seems it will be EVIL DEAD 2) looks instantly attractive. The elements of the plot change – the sister of the hypothetically 'new Ash' (turns to be played by an actor who's too 'juvenile') suffers of a severe drug addiction. It all starts with her new attempt of getting sober inside a cabin in the woods, certainly. The transition feels natural and it all works: the friends of the girl, just like his brother, think the supernatural changes she's having (you know what type of changes) are just effects of the abstinence. Obviously, we know what it means to have those scenes with the camera quickly moving through the woods. Part of that fun vulgarity of the original is present here too; there are some moments of pure black humor ready to be appreciated by fans of Raimi. The characters suffer and suffer again and from our point of view it all looks really f****** painful; it's a movie with enough mutilations. When I watched it on the big screen some people left the theater, so the deal is quite simple: if you like bloody movies, EVIL DEAD will not disappoint you for the lack of gore. It's fast, entertaining, and has an emblematic climax with blood literally everywhere, obscenities, and the classic chainsaw! *Watched it on 02 April, 2013",9,11,31,24 April 2013
The Evil Dead," No One Here Gets Out Alive
","Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead simply rocks. We have two dudes and three young women, better said we have Bruce Campbell and the victims. Or even better said, we have five victims that for us will be in danger since the first seconds of the film but that will know that they are in real danger as the story unfolds. Pretty much I was ready to like a lot this film, it's been more than a year since it's DVD has been waiting and basically the moment one of the women (the one played by Ellen Sandweiss, to be more clear) goes out (wait, the setting: Bruce Campbell's character Ash is together with his girlfriend Linda, his sister and two friends vacationing in an old cabin right up in the mountains. Book of the Dead, 'it deals with demons, demon resurrection and those forces which round the forest') the old cabin and has a truly horrifying experience the moment I said to myself: this is just F**K**G (yes, the f****** goes in capitals) awesome fun! Is the beginning of the end, just the beginning of a series of freaking insane moments, certainly with The Evil Dead we have a case of a film that does lives up to its great cult status. And Bruce Campbell is just really cool as the dude who will not only lose his beloved girlfriend, sister and friends but also will have to deal with demons with the shape of his beloved ones, Ash not only loses his beloved ones (first his sister and later on his friend Shelly, his girlfriend Linda and finally his friend Scotty) but he has to beat the s*** out of the possessed them (Scotty also has to get violent). Nothing but a real torture, your girlfriend is now an annoying demon that tricks you, that laughs at, that will try f****** kill you, it's a great (only for us certainly) bloody night up there in the mountains",Null,0,0,14 September 2009
From Dusk Till Dawn," 'What, were they psychos?'; One of my favourites from RR/QT
","A new Robert Rodriguez film will be hitting the theaters very soon, not really the long- awaited first sequel of one of the very best maybe just the very best comic book film ever made or the maybe-it-goes-straight-to-DVD-or-maybe-it-gets-a-theatrical-release Grindhouse presentation Machete (can't wait!) but a film more in the vein of his Spy Kids trilogy and his 2005 The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. Now, I haven't seen any of those films however I do want to check out Shorts and hopefully I will be enjoying it on the big screen the day it opens (in my country Shorts will be released on 7 August 2009 and two weeks later from that Friday it will be in American theaters) but meanwhile I want to visit for the very first time some RR films, so maybe I will check out Spy Kids, well hell as for today I have yet to see plenty of RR films (the four I mentioned plus his two first ones, El Mariachi and the TV movie Roadracers, and The Faculty). This one, From Dusk Till Dawn, was before today in that list, well I had seen before some bits of its first part (and certainly the famous part of Salma Hayek) but just today I finally saw it in its entirety.And From Dusk Till Dawn has two parts, Salma Hayek sort of marks the end of the first part, the part in which she kills Quentin Tarantino's character but not really literally, the only part in which Hayek is sexy and yes here Hayek stops being sexyyou don't believe me? Well, I can tell you, second part is carnage with only few moments for our characters to really think about what's going on, to really be sure about what they are dealing with. And is great, very memorable fun, with Tom Savini and Fred Williamson (as Sex Machine and Frost, respectively) joining our main characters, but wait I haven't say much about our main characters so: Tarantino plays what is my favourite of his characters, I mean not my favourite of the characters he had written but just of the ones he has played. Tarantino, who also wrote the screenplay, plays Richard Gecko (by reading some other comments I can say most of the people hated Tarantino here, for me it's a lot of great fun with him), sex freak, crazy bastard, criminal and brother of George Clooney's (you can say whatever you want about Clooney but he is great in the Coen brothers masterpiece O Brother, Where Art Thou?, he is awesome here so) character Seth Gecko. Both had killed in a week 5 Texas rangers, 8 police officers and 3 civilians and while the authorities say they will caught the fugitives within the next 48 hours the Gecko brothers are on their way to Mexico. The introduction to the Gecko brothers is just superb, as a whole it's a really great opening, and certainly is clear who is who, who is the craziest son of a bitch, who will make things harder for himself and for his brother. Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu play the other main characters, the family Fuller, victims of the Gecko brothers, they did what they had to and they were going to leave Mexico to can tell later on their unfortunate encounter with the Gecko brothers but when the carnage is on'what, were they psychos?', Cheech Marin is also very memorable here!Why I waited till now to see this film, this awesome film? Damn, but now I'm so glad I finally saw it, just loved each second of its two parts, it's awesome fun, underrated and one of favourites from RR/QT!",Null,0,1,28 July 2009
Paranormal Activity," Dragging her to hell
","Yesterday I finally watched on the big screen this extremely successful low-budget horror movie. As a punk rocker towards horror films I was more than ready enjoy it, to like it yet not be scared at all... even before watching PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, that Steven Spielberg wanted to disappear his DVD of the movie after watching it and being scared as f*** is like 'really? I mean, really?'. So now that I have experienced what for many is the best of the genre in a long time is for me the same, I mean is still the 'really? I mean, really?', coming after Spielberg's story. I think the situation with my aunt can help me to let you know my feelings towards PARANORMAL ACTIVITY: she didn't want to watch the Spanish hit REC on the big screen back in 2008. I saw it by on the big screen and while it didn't totally shocked me, I was glad she didn't want to experience it on the big screen because I knew she would not had enjoyed it at all. And I know that's part of the fun, but frankly and since she is my aunt and since I saw how she suffered with PLANET TERROR, well you know. Yesterday I saw PARANORMAL ACTIVITY with my sis, cousin and my aunt. I was worried, or well I was ready to see after a certain shocking scene how my aunt was. 'I only was a bit tense each time the hour appeared on the screen, but nothing more', those were her words after watching this movie. Really there are no hardcore moments in this movie, of course that lends to the disappointment of many (my sis and cousin hated it). I wasn't disappointed but certainly I wasn't expecting something to be totally scared by. I liked it as solid and fun entertainment but definitely I will not visit it again on DVD or Blu-Ray.Basically here we don't have the main characters, Katie (Katie Featherston) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat), sort of unaware about the paranormal stuff, actually Katie knows and feels that she is being haunted by a ghost or something since she was a kid. So what we see here is thanks to Micah and his attempt to help his girlfriend by filming while they are sleeping to capture anything paranormal. It's really entertaining and, thanks to Micah, funny (Micah is at first totally skeptical, just playing around with the camera and wanting to film cool things) and it works in the regard of having a credible transformation of the main characters. We, or at least I, are never scared but we understand the hard times this couple is living (those scenes with Katie all tired of everything) and in that regard the movie works since we think in these characters as helpless young people, not quite like in DRAG ME TO HELL where we see the main character (also a young woman being haunted) at one point doing what the right stuff in order to get back to her normal life. Here Katie's only hopes are his boyfriend (who doesn't have a clue to end with the problem) and a demonologist (!) that we never see. But those scenes with the hour in the screen, those scenes that show what happens each night when Micah and Katie are sleeping are even fun to watch, not because are darn cool but just because the audience's reactions. So, I liked this movie, found it totally entertaining but just that.",7,0,3,31 December 2009
Black Snake Moan," 'I've done a bad thing, cut my brother in half'
","Samuel L. Jackson makes like 5 movies peer year, most of them are just not good. Still I was expecting maybe hoping to found Black Snake Moan as not just another decent movie. There are some things that helped a lot Black Snake Moan in order to be what I was expecting. Jackson is really good here as the old Lazarus who is an old blues player now suffering due to his wife, now ex-wife and with that founding the blues again. Could have like a dream for anyone what happened to Lazarus. He found a semi naked girl (Ricci) in the middle of the road, a girl who has been suffering a lot. But the dream will be for that girl, not immediately and less with that chain of course. She is part of other story with her boyfriend (Justin Timberlake). A couple that will be separated due to the war. Timberlake can't act but I will write about the cast a little later. This movie is basically the story of a girl who suffered since she was young abuse and that bring in the present the consequences that we are watching. She found like an effective medicine for her sickness in the character that Timberlake plays but she found a cure with Lazarus.During the first part f the film we see Ricci in underwear all the time and during that part we have also some funny situations, with Lazarus' young helper for example. When Timberlake arrives again we can see again the bad actor he is and we have an anticipated conclusion but by then we have already enjoyed Ricci and some great music. I think there are only like three songs in the movie (I'm not counting Ricci's since it's like a country song). I saw this one with some friends and my cousin who, like me, recently watched Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. We could not take the blues songs seriously here; it was like every time a blues note started he was like ' cut my brother in half' and stuff. Don't watch this with someone who you know is funny and that has seen Walk Hard. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is good but definitely is not any kind of a special performance just like the film is not any kind of a great one. But it wasn't in absolute a complete waste of time so it's basically your decision.",Null,1,2,29 August 2008
Hotel Transylvania," Average material; it wastes the cool thing of having tons of classic monsters together
","HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA wasn't as clever (nor as fun) as I imagined. I even went for it during my birthday; since 2009 I've been celebrating my birthday by going to the cinema and this year I had three potential choices: THE WATCH, DREDD 3D and this one. It was a question of time that I ended watching 'Transylvania' over THE WATCH, which was the one I truly wanted to enjoy. Anyway, I have to mention that one of the trailers I got to watch was the one of the upcoming Disney film WRECK-IT RALPH; it seems that 'Ralph' will not miss the chance to deliver really clever material out of a mash-up of classic characters (video games characters, like Nintendo's Bowser, in that case). 'Transylvania', on the contrary, missed its chance with the classic 'Universal Monsters' (Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man) and some others monsters. It's clear that the whole horror atmosphere was the reason I wanted to check this one out. Here's a piece of advice for anyone who wants to watch it as well as a horror fan, looking for some nice and fun references or something like that: watch this year's PARANORMAN instead, or something like MONSTER HOUSE (Gil Kenan, 2006), as there's pretty much nothing worthy of admiration here. Well, there's something nice in the last section of the film and I will explain it to make a point. The core of the storyline is that Dracula (voice of Adam Sandler – definitely his best or better said, his only honorable work in the last years) built a place for any monster that wanted some peace; a hotel nowhere nears a human civilization. So we have monsters that basically don't know humans; the nice thing comes when they finally go out and get to see some horror fans (in a way this thing is like that with Johnny Depp, as an 18th-century vampire, waking up in the seventies, from DARK SHADOWS); eventually, there's a terrific joke on the TWILIGHT thing: we have Dracula (or 'Drac', as he is referred during the whole movie) totally disappointed after getting to see how humans represent the monsters by watching some TWILIGHT!Good stuff, right? However, the point I want to make is that there's always a problem when a movie that judges how awful the horror genre has been treated lately is itself making, for instance, a Kanye West sort-of rapper out of Dracula. I mean, I get it, I get that right from the first scene of the movie we are going to watch a different version of Dracula, as, after all, this is a kid's flick (in fact, we have Dracula as a single father!). However, the whole thing is sort- of annoying, even if you accept it as something completely unrelated to the classic monsters. It's one of those, like the last MADAGASCAR, with lots of things going on. There's a lot of noise but nothing that truly gets you or that makes you laugh hard (there are, nevertheless, some funny bits involving the Invisible Man). That's on one hand, and on the other we have a formulaic story about an over-protective father and love. In conclusion, HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is average material that totally wastes its main attraction. *Watched it on 02 October, 2012",5,1,7,3 October 2012
Big Fish," The grass so green. Skies so blue. Big Fish is really great!
","In the deathbed of his father Edward (Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor), William Bloom (Billy Crudup) still doesn't know if all of his father's fantastic stories are true and also he doesn't know who is really his father. The film show those fantastic and incredible stories that will turn Edward in an immortal man that everybody will remember through his own stories.The script of this beautiful and incredible film was based upon the 1998 novel 'Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions', written by Daniel Wallace. It was directed by one of my favourite directors ever, Tim Burton in the time when he lost his own father so this film can be his most personal work. I really love the story, about a reconciliation between father & son, both storytellers but what is the difference is that Edward tell his own life as a fantastic tale with many excellent characters. I love the fact that Edward tell his stories too many times that nobody can imagine his life in other way, a more realistic way and i think that's why Will is so confused about his father. And i love too all the stories of Edward with all of his exaggerations. There are all great but my favourite is the one when he told how he meet Sandra (Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman), is a really great love tale.And all with those great and memorable characters including a giant (Matthew McGrory), a witch (Helena Bonham Carter) and some others. But my favourite is the poet Norther Winslow who is living in a 'perfect' town called Spectre and is writing his new poem for 12 years and this lines are all he have: 'The grass so green. Skies so blue. Spectre is really great!', played in an excellent and funny way by the great Steve Buscemi who is one of my favourite actors.What else i can say about this perfect film that is maybe my favourite of Tim Burton along with 'Ed Wood',well just that i have my own story with this film. I remember pretty well that about 5 years ago i found Tim Burton thanks to my cousin. I spend the Christmas vacations of that year 2003 watching most of Burton stuff and he was my first favourite director that change my life in the way that after watching his films i really start to love cinema and start to investigate about directors, actors, actresses and all those things that you do when you have a really interest in something. After that i knew about this film that it was going to be released in Mexico in February of 2004. It was the very first time i enter in a cinema knowing about who direct this film and all those little details that as a cinema lover you like to know.Conclusion: 'Big Fish' is one of my personal favourite films ever and every time i remember about that day ,when i was very young, in which i watch the film i just feel really happy and with desires of watch it again. And i'm not exaggerating. 10 out of 10, the perfect film for my comment #100.",10,0,0,13 February 2008
The Dark Knight," Why So Serious? When You Can Smile Because The Dark Knight Is Here And Because It Is Fantastic
","When I was a kid I taped the first Tim Burton's Batman from TV and I have truly great memories with that film (and with that tape), a 1989 film that I haven't watch since long time ago. I felt and I still feel an enormous admiration for Jack Nicholson and I think his joker was great but since I saw for the very first time Heath Ledger with the joker makeup and suit, I just loved the new joker. Yesterday I read again (now in a newspaper) the declarations of Jack Nicholson about the 'new' joker and his words are even kind of ridiculous, maybe he was joking when he said that he should have been playing this joker since he can be easily the father or even the grandfather of Bruce Wayne. Today I saw The Dark Knight, on a midnight 'special' screening just for the record, and even I still have those great memories of Nicholson's joker, I really don't remember feeling in the same way that when I saw Ledger's joker on the screen; he is absolutely fantastic just like this second take on Christopher Nolan's Batman, the second take and definitely my favourite of all the Batman films. Ledger's joker is the kind of villain, or better, the kind of character that you are just waiting for his next appearance, just to enjoy his presence on the screen and to enjoy the great character that is the joker. Of course as the joker becomes a character that itself makes a film worthwhile, he becomes the puppeteer of Gotham City, playing with the mob as if they were little kids and making a brilliant movement after a brilliant movement (the opening sequence is more than fantastic). This time Batman is not the protagonist but he is for sure the only one in who the joker feels respect or at least some excitement and the joker knows that Batman changed forever Gotham City but at the same time he knows how to play with him by making that Gotham City itself put the pressure on the hero and in this way Harvey Dent (a terrific performance of Aaron Eckhart and for me it was a surprise to see him on this film since I only remember him from Thank You for Smoking) will play a very important role since he is the real and new hero of Gotham City but he will live a situation that will mark him forever and that makes the film works in another level. And the joker likes to play on that level and is intelligence is simply amazing. The are some situations that are memorable in the film; I loved that the joker's origin is never explain and it seems that he arrives just to pull the strings and maybe it was because of his father or maybe because of his wife (I loved at both dialogs), who knows and actually it is not very relevant. But all of this comes back when the joker tries to put on his level 'regular' persons and he succeeded for example with a cop who is full of anger when the joker ask him how many of his friends have died because of his acts but his most important success is on Dent who will try to put James Gordon in his same previous situation. On this level The Dark Knight is great with a story involving the classic corruption, the hopeless madness, the honesty and the meaning of the word hero yet the action is also great and exciting, starting with a memorable sequence, as I write before, just to grab your attention and it takes Batman, in a strange move, even to Hong Kong! But as I write before too, the joker's movements are just to follow and even we you don't expect anything he puts to the civilians the clown masks, tied guns in their hands and leaves everything for a civilian massacre. To talk about Ledger himself is kind of unnecessary since just after his suicide his joker became a cult character and also because we can resume all the performances in this film with only one word: great (I didn't missed Holmes and I'm glad that Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman and, specially, Gary Oldman are here again).The hype was huge and actually this is the first and probably the unique summer film that has that mentioned special midnight screening, you know to start watching The Dark Knight in the first minute of the day of its release (for the record, this is the first time that I went to one of this midnight screenings and I found some curiosities like that people likes them, the cinema was full which was really awaited, and that there are no trailers, you know to start exactly at 00:00), and that was my strongest card for this 2008 summer. I'm more than glad to say that I really loved The Dark Knight and on a personal level, this is my favourite Batman film ever. Tim Burton gave us two great films but now, well actually back in 2005 Nolan re- bird Batman and that was truly fantastic but The Dark Knight is even more fantastic. Don't miss the chance to see this one on the big screen!",10,13,27,18 July 2008
Into the Wild," 'Riding high amongst the waves I can feel like I have a soul that has been saved'
","Giving the nature of the story the film was going to be very emotional. It's a difficult story indeed but the structure of the film makes it incredibly more effective, I think that's one of the main achievements of Sean Penn here. Since I first knew about INTO THE WILD I really wanted to watch it. The fact that one of my idols, Eddie Vedder, composed the soundtrack was a big plus. I'm not mentioning the book the film is based on since just right now, and after watching the film last night, I'm realizing about the existence of John Krakauer's bestselling book. I didn't knew much about the film before watching it, I mean I wanted to check it out since it was brand-new but really I didn't read or hear that much about it (and sort of forget about it when every time I went to a DVD store the price of its DVD was still the same, a ridiculously high price). I even doubted in the course of the film if it was based in a real story, I recalled something of that but frankly it was until I saw the real picture of Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch plays, in a superb way, Chris, a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp) when I was a hundred percent sure about that. Not knowing about Chris I think was a good thing since even since always during the film the destiny of Chris was clear I still wasn't too sure about it. Like I said, I think the structure is essential for the effectiveness of this film. We have two parts: 'Alaska's Magic Bus' and 'The amazing journey'. You're always extremely interested to find out what's behind and what happens in the 'Alaska's Magic Bus' part, you want to know the why and the conclusion all the time. I'll give you a quick summary of the beginning of 'The amazing journey': Chris is finally finishing college, a great achievement for him? Not really as is not important or a matter to be happy about that his parents, Walt (William Hurt) and Billie (Marcia Gay Harden), will buy him a new car since he had success in college. For Chris is time to see where the wild things are. Once Quentin Tarantino said '', of course in reference to his masterpiece PULP FICTION. While INTO THE WILD is only about Chris' story there are many answers you just want to know immediately, you know more or less how those answers will be but still you want them immediately. Thankfully you feel safe. The storytelling is perfect, it never feels forced when it comes to find out the why The landscapes are just to enjoy. Story takes you everywhere, and I don't mean that because Chris is in many places but because he experiments so many feelings. People, this is when you know the structure is perfect ruco, for your girlfriend and maybe even for you will be hard not to cry. Best performance Emile has done so far",10,3,6,4 March 2010
Annie Hall," I know it sounds clichéd, but this is my favorite Woody Allen film
","Actually that is a brand-new thought since before last Saturday I would refer to THE PURPLE ROSE OF THE CAIRO as my favorite Woody Allen. Watching ANNIE HALL again was marvelous; it was only my second time with it, and the first one was years ago, when I was a kid. I didn't fully appreciate it and I even thought of it as probably Allen's most over-rated film. Last Saturday night was pretty much incredible: there's a new drive-in theater in my city (first one in many years) and I went for the very first time, with my girlfriend to see ANNIE HALL on the big screen (for the very first time). It blew my mind. It has everything. It is Allen's masterpiece, by far. And I have to thank my girlfriend since without her almost new love for Allen I would have not been re-watching this or watching for the very first time minor works like ANOTHER WOMAN. Anyway, like with any other real classic I ask myself: what else can I write about it? Maybe I will just share how I was blown anyway with some moments. I recalled some classic stuff, like Allen (as character Alvy) suffering in the line for THE SORROW AND THE PITY thanks to an annoying and supposedly clever guy! I mean, when you are in a similar situation, that IS the scene you always recall! But I had forgotten other elements, and I was completely marveled by it (and I had forgotten also some jokes – everybody always recall the opening of the film or some lines, but no one goes for the thing with the African American maid! I laughed my head off!); for instance, I recently watched WHATEVER WORKS (Allen's 2008 picture) and pointed out how things like having the main character talking to the audience and stuff felt pretty much like a pointless element. Here, on the contrary, everything that is in that same vein feels -in a word- brilliant. And yes, ANNIE HALL features a quite beautiful take on relationships; obviously at this point in my life, I thought of it in a much different way than years ago. There are some really touching moments, and certainly there's nothing better than this when it comes to thinking in Allen and Diane Keaton together. But the greatest thing about this film is how it feels just like an example of Allen's genius. Certainly what's in his mind is always present, like his not very kind opinion of Hollywood (I didn't remember, by the way, that Paul Simon, from Simon & Garfunkel, is here pretty damn cool!), but sometimes we even have a visual representation of it. He is doing whatever he wanted to; he is bringing Marshall McLuhan to the screen and he is not caring too much about Bob Dylan! Hell, there's even some animation so yes, think of this as the finest example of why Woody Allen is one of the masters. *Watched it (again) on February 11, 2012 (at a drive-in theater).",10,0,0,15 February 2012
Green Street Hooligans," 'I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles'; Lexi Alexander's film is certainly not a masterpiece but surely a personal favourite
","After the Lord of the Rings trilogy Elijah Wood's first acting credit was in Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine but the first time I saw Elijah after that great trilogy was in Sin City, and the second time in Lexi Alexander's Hooligans (aka: Green Street Hooligans) back in December 2005 (in that year, 2005, Elijah participated in 3 films, having the main role in 2, and the 3, Sin City, Everything Is Illuminated and this one, are truly favourites of mine). I remember seeing parts of Hooligans at my former school and on TV but just yesterday I finally saw again in its entirely (got its R4 DVD last week for like $2, and as bonus material on that DVD there's only a 4 or so minutes interview with Elijah that ends with him sending greetings to his Mexican fans) and I say finally since back in 2005 I loved it, actually just as much as I did yesterday. Elijah Wood was a good choice: he plays Matt Buckner, Harvard student, great Harvard student, former Harvard student at the beginning of the film actually. He was really close to finish the journalism career yet his roommate, his cocaine-addict roommate from a powerful family I guess I don't have to go on. So at the beginning of the film we have the Matt that didn't fought at all in order to try not to get expelled from Harvard few months before getting the diploma and at the end the one that decided to fight to get his ticket back to Harvard after he spend some time in London (yeah! He took the 10 grand of the cocaine- addict and practically will end with him). The title of the film says all certainly, Matt's sister (lovely Claire Forlani) lives in London and she is married to the brother (Marc Warren) of the current leader of the Green Street Elite (Charlie Hunnam is Pete Dunham), the firm of the East London club West Ham United Words of Pete: 'West Ham United, mediocre football, topnotch firm. Arsenal, great football sh*t firm. Tottenham, sh*t football and sh*t firm'. Certainly there's some rejoice for football fans like myself, I mean the love for that great sport is certainly present. The film sure is typical not only because we have in Matt the outsider who likes baseball better than football, the 'Yank' ('for f*** sake stop saying soccer!') who will enter to the world of the firms and gain the respect of even the one that was always the hard member of the firm (Leo Gregory plays Bovver) but also because we have all the other typical elements, you know journalism is the thing that will put Matt in real problems with the members of the firm when he is already part of them (and that leads to the most dramatic part of the film), with the brother of Pete we have the character that once was part of the world of the firmsI guess I don't have to go on. Yet I'm OK this time with the typical elements (but I must say the music choice was not the best, especially that song in the fight of the GSE against the Millwall hooligans), Hooligans is simply a personal favourite, certainly not a masterpiece, it's just a terrific piece of entertainment with terrific acting (hey that actor that plays Matt's father sort of look at times like De Niro)... I'm forever blowing bubbles, pretty bubbles in the air!",9,0,0,17 July 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A film to remember
","Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has erased him from her memory due to a problematic relationship. He look out for the creator of that process, the doctor Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and decide to erase Clementine from his memory but what Joel doesn't know is that he still loves her.The script of the great film ,written by Charlie Kaufman & Michel Gondry, is nothing but a great, original and sometimes touching story about the eternal love of two persons. The non-linear way that the film is told is really great and will keep you in alert all the 108 minutes of the film. I love the story of Joel and Clementine, two persons that must be together and doesn't matter that creepy process because their love is so strong that nothing can erase it. That process is really amazing and very difficult to deal with and must be really convince about use it. I'm not sure if the process really works for two persons that once were in love, it's a fact that technically works but in the case of Mary (Kirsten Dunst) in the end the process don't work because she fell in love with Dr. Howard Mierzwiak again. So i think the process will erase your memories about the time that you spend with the person but you can't really forget that person because in both cases of the film the couples still feel something about each other. So i think you can't just forget a person, yes you can forget about the bad times with the person but if you feel in love with her/him again you will have the same experiences?Anyway i really love that things of the film and also some really great lines. The cast of the film is superb; Jim Carrey is amazing in his most recognized work. I was checking his filmography in this site and i must say that i really like most of his films and i consider myself a big fan of Carrey so i found this performance as just another great one from a great actor. Kate Winslet is amazing too, i think is the first time i see her after the extremely overrated 'Titanic', so for me this is my favourite performance of her. The supporting cast is great, with Kirsten Dunst in a great and very touching role, Elijah Wood & Mark Ruffalo are great too but i really hate the role of Wood.When this film was released back in 2004, everybody seems to like it and i hear really good things about it from people who i know but i never feel lots of desires to watch it and later i just forget about the film. After almost four years of it's release (19 March 2004 according to this site) i finally watch this film near the Valentine's day for pure coincidence . For that i want to say that my favourite line of the film is the one in the first sequence when Joel express his feels about that day. I think is a great film to forget about that day and remember that love is not only for one day peer year. Conclusion: i really like this film, a very different one but i don't give it a 10 because i feel that in a way Michel Gondry was abusing of his particular style in this film. Anyway this film is a film to remember. 9 out of 10Region 4 DVD: this DVD is really complete with many extras like making of the film, an interview with Gondry and Carrey and some others like a commercial of Lacuna.",9,1,4,17 February 2008
Alice in Wonderland," and if you go chasing rabbits
","Alice in Wonderland came out in times where I don't, anymore, get extremely excited about a Tim Burton film. It's not really because I hated his most recent films, actually, and aside of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I really liked them (actually I think both Corpse Bride and Sweeney Todd are great films) is just that since Big Fish I haven't felt the need to watch for the second time a Burton film. So in a way I came to see Alice in Wonderland without the huge expectations of manyand if you go chasing rabbits Alice in Wonderland came out in times where I don't, anymore, get extremely excited about a Tim Burton film.

Drag Me to Hell," 'I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!'
","Drag Me To Hell, Sam Raimi's first non-Spiderman film since 2000, was released in my city more than a week ago, on 21 August 2009, but just yesterday I finally had the chance to check it out on the big screen (last weekend was very hectic). I'm glad, my introduction to the non-Spiderman Raimi was fantastic and yes, even thought I own since more than a year ago Raimi's first feature film, The Evil Dead, on DVD I only can say that from him I have seen nothing more aside of this, the 3 Spider-man films and some parts of both Darkman and Army of Darknessshame on me, I f****** know! But I promise to myself that I will finally see The Evil Dead during this week (and Army of Darkness and Darkman as soon as possible), but well before that happens let's add some more words to this IMDb comment of Drag Me To HellSam Raimi's film (he also wrote it together with his brother Ivan Raimi) opens in a typical way: we have the case that will be similar to the one that our main character will have to deal with, of course it happens many years before and of course it will be always be present in the course of the film to finally make the direct connection with our main character. And is Alison Lohman who plays this main character (thank god Ellen Juno Page dropped out the film!), she is the lovely Christine Brown and she is really great. Of course Christine will be the one dealing with the not quite normal stuff that of course would be just freaking unbelievable for almost everybody, and boy is she going to suffer. And she is basically alone, I mean sure her boyfriend (played by Justin Long) is there supporting her but is just her thing, certainly she will have to believe in well in f****** anything, the words of a psychic will be as believable as ever for her! Like I said, Drag Me To Hell is typical, is a simple film that works just about fine with the normal plot of having our main character cursed, suffering and of course seeking for help, for the way to give herself, and us, a happy ending. And it works just about fine for those touches, for those really cool touches and for those really good and enjoyable performances by its entire cast. Justin Long, Lorna Raver, Dileep Rao, Reggie Lee, Adriana Barraza deserves a mention since they all are truly great, delivering lots of fun and memorable moments. Starting with a really cool and intense fight between the two main women of the story (Christine and, Lorna Raver's character, Sylvia Ganush) the film is full of ingenious parts, is of course full of scenes that will make your girlfriend jump off her seat and make expressions of disgust. The film is conventional in many ways of course but Raimi's touches are really terrific, those scenes that are simply funny and, mostly, those that are fun because of being sort of over the top are enough to make of this worth watching material. For example, the stuff with the cat of the protagonist: sure the 'hey kitty kitty' is funny, and of course ultimately scary, but the 'I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!' with the cat being returned to its owner is just f****** cool, just f****** fun time at the movies. Or the stuff with the boss of Christine (played by David Paymer), I mean the bloody problem of Christine, that is first scary and embarrassing for Christine, second f****** cool and fun with the boss soaked of blood and third just plain hilarious with the boss just worried for not having blood in his mouth. It's crazy time at the movies, with a crazy and vengeful old lady, an annoying fly (loved when it touches the camera), psychics that for once are not full of s***, a poor but ultimately insane goat and a poor young womanI just had a truly great time watching Raimi's latest work.",9,4,8,30 August 2009
Invictus," One of Clint's weakest films from the past decade
","This could have been a great film, in the same line of quality of Clint's previous ones Changeling and Gran Torino (yes, I know many don't consider Gran Torino a great film but I just loved that film). It is a period piece about Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman delivers as Mandela) and his peculiar relation, as the president of South Africa, with the sport of the minority, the rugby. I trust in a filmmaker like Eastwood and indeed I think the problem of Invictus is not related with the thing that it is a period piece: the research was made (in this case, the film was based on John Carlin's Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation), I mean, the historical inaccuracies reported are, at least for my money, not quite important ('Johan de Villiers the TV commentator who first bad-mouths the Boks and then praises the Springboks, after the final whistle, asks the question of Pienaar: 'What did it feel like to have 62,000 fans supporting you in the stadium?' and receives the answer: 'We didn't have 62,000 fans behind us, we had 43 million South Africans.' It was in fact a SABC reporter called David van der Sandt'). So in Invictus we see facts and certainly for people who didn't much about Mandela and the game that changed a nation, people like me, it is a pretty useful film. But anyway, you don't need to be a hundred percent faithful with the facts to create a masterpiece. That said, Invictus was nothing less than a true disappointment, with many weak elements.",Null,0,1,3 March 2010
Super 8," Make your own damn -super 8- movie!
","I just finished reading a couple of terrific books about cinema: THE KILL BILL DIARY, by the late David Carradine, and MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE!, by the legendary father of the Toxic Avenger Lloyd Kaufman (one of my heroes). Reading them back-to-back was pretty interesting as I could have a nice look at the making of both a big-budget and a low-budget movie, the anti-Spielberg school of though (both Carradine and Kaufman are Spielberg detractors) and at the passion and compromise of a filmmaker; I mean, in those books you deal with Tarantino and Kaufman and both are truly hard-workers with an infinite love for cinema. SUPER 8 is obviously about movies; it's about the essence of both a low-budget and a big- budget picture. That's why I recalled those books, and how Tarantino and Kaufman work, while watching J.J. Abrams' movie. Here we have, just like in this year's FRANKENWEENIE, the clear indication that the director had a love towards movies since he was a little kid and began expressing that by making crappy, wonderful super 8 films. Trey Parker writes in the foreword to MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE! that after watching THE TOXIC AVENGER as a 13-year-old boy, he was inspired to shot (in super 8, I suppose) his own damn crap – Parker is only 3 years younger than J.J. Abrams, so you know what I mean. Abrams is doing here a wonderful tribute to the early days of any filmmaker of his generation, and to the stuff they all loved too (super 8 films, STAR WARS and vintage Spielberg). And to do that he is basically dividing SUPER 8 into two films: one with the essence of guerrilla filmmaking and the other with everything a big-budget Hollywood movie offers, like I said. SUPER 8 is about a group of kids in the late seventies; with the inspiration of such low-budget horror classics as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, they are shooting their own damn super 8 zombie movie. The director of that little movie is not our main character but his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths); this chubby director is pure f****** guerrilla filmmaking! The cool thing is that I could see both Tarantino and Kaufman in the boy. In THE KILL BILL DIARY, Carradine says that Quentin is always writing new lines and stuff during production; and in Kaufman's book we learn that he, well, does everything the guerrilla way: changes the script all the time and is always looking for 'production value' like some fire trucks, for instance. The chubby kid does the exact same things while shooting his zombie flick. The production value that Charles wants for his movie is actually part of the production value that Abrams is showing off: a huge train. SUPER 8 is (in part, like I mentioned) basically Abrams showing off his 50 million dollars budget. If you're like me and don't really have a big admiration for the big Hollywood disaster pictures (which always involve the US army and stuff), well, guess what? SUPER 8 is probably as noisy, if not nosier, than most. There are explosions everywhere and noise and a train crashing in the most unbelievable, exaggerated, pure Hollywood way. But you know what? SUPER 8 is really clever and, by far, my favorite big- disaster-Hollywood movie in recent memory. Let's all forget CLOVERFIELD (not that I think in it constantly) and enjoy this fun and emotive one (think in the 2009 masterpiece DISTRICT 9 and in any great coming-of-age film for the emotional aspect) that, just like those books I read, gives some nice lessons about cinema (hell, it even shows you how to make the audience care for your characters!). Lloyd Kaufman says that there's nothing wrong with going mainstream if you do some good out of it (like Trey Parker or SUPER director James Gunn, he adds). For my money, Abrams is doing exactly that, if not with every single one of his projects, at least with SUPER 8. PS: you must, hell, you will stay for the closing credits for some damn fun and a couple of great songs, including the classic 'My Sharona'! *Watched it on 06 and 17 October, 2012",10,0,2,22 October 2012
Up," The Great Gig in the Sky
","Last year's Pixar production had the best possible reviews, I remember going to see WALL*E expecting to experience what for many people it was: the very best Pixar film. I loved WALL*E as much as you fellow reader but I don't consider it the very best Pixar film, it is not even one of my 5 favourite Pixar films, hell I haven't felt desires to buy/rent its DVD, I haven't felt desires to watch it for the second time. I just saw Pixar's latest production (in 3-D and it looks, as expected, just wonderful!) Up (Peter Docter directed it being his second Pixar film. His other, the 2001 Monsters Inc., is my second favourite from Pixar) and for me is just as wonderful as WALL*E and Ratatouille (another film I haven't seen since I saw it for the very first time on the big screen back in 2007) but like those two films it is not one of my most favourites from Pixar.Anyway, the preview I saw of Up didn't allow me (thankfully) to see any characters but only the main ones: the old man Carl Fredricksen (voice of Edward Aisner) and the kid Russell (Jordan Nagai), the preview showed the old man with his floating house and later realizing that he had a guest. But Up actually begins when Carl was younger than Russell, when Carl met Ellie (Elizabeth Docter), the girl that just like him loved adventures, loved exploder Charles Muntz, the girl that eventually became the woman of his life. All of what Carl and Ellie shared is fantastically told, is realistic, touching, is a really great part of the film. The director Peter Docter said this: 'the message of the film is that the real adventure of life is the relationship we have with other people, and it's so easy to lose sight of the things we have and the people that are around us until they're gone. More often than not I don't really realize how lucky I was to have known someone until they're either moved or passed away. So if you can kind of wake up a little bit and go, 'Wow, I've got some really cool stuff around me every day', then that's what the movie's about'. Ellie passes away, then we move to the present with Carl, the present is still realistic and also sad, no country for old men certainly, the destiny of Carl is to go to a retirement home but then the extraordinary begins, then the dream of Ellie as kid of having her clubhouse in Paradise Falls is the one and only objective of Carl and well Carl will not leave his house and is satisfying as hell! Like almost everybody I knew that at one point Carl was going to use lots and lots of balloons to make his house fly so for me the 'weird' stuff began once Carl and Russell (he is a hilarious character, you will love him and well he being a wilderness explorer was trying to earn the 'assisting the elderly' badge ended in Carl's house) arrive to South America, I was like 'talking dogs in the middle of the jungle?', this stuff with the dogs is really hilarious. It works like with the elderly (Carl certainly and also Charles Muntz, yes Carl will meet his hero who now owns the bunch of dogs and lives in Paradise Falls just to capture a weird bird that Russell calls Kevin!), I mean on one hand we have the extraordinary: talking dogs, all the amazing movements that Carl and Russell do in the course of the film, the dogs being chefs, etc. And on the other hand we have the realistic moments (apart of those from the beginning of the film, from the story of Carl and Ellie) : the dogs being totally controlled by that who has the ball or the food, the elderly having problems to fight (hilarious scene!), etc. The deal is that the film always works, and well Up is just another triumph for Pixar! 9.5 out of 10",9,2,4,5 June 2009
The Fly," Flesh
","In my comment for Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007) I wrote that even I don't like the idea of re-making the classics there are some that I really love. Certainly Cronenberg's Fly is one of them. This 1986 version of the 1958 classic has some similar things of that film but in the end it feels like a complete different story that has no things of the original. Of course the basic plot is the same but this film focuses more and just to the process and consequences of the masterpiece of a brilliant scientist. The 1958 version is pure narrative which is great but basically we don't see a true following to the scientist after his masterpiece change his life and here that following is amazing, bizarre, funny and with some nasty images, especially if you're eating something. One of the things that may be similar is the fact that there are few characters but here it feels the fact that in any time this story with be known by all the world. To make that the woman, who is going to be near the scientist (Jeff Goldblum), work as a journalist is the main reason of that feel. The scientist name is Seth Brundle and he is like a young Einstein (he also bought many identical sets of clothes) whose only interest is to keep on going with his experiments. He is a shy person who never leaves his home so when the journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) appears his life will never be the same but not particularly because of her. Here we have the great and interesting following to a science experiment with Veronica being witness and recording every little detail of Brundle's process in order to improve his own masterpiece, the thing that will change the world forever. Eventually the Telepods will only change Brundle's life and we are going to see a great character study in a situation that has never happened in the world. I think everybody who may be reading this knows how and for what the Telepods work and what happened to Brundle when a fly went inside one of the Telepods, so I think is unnecessary to write it. So when finally the new creature is evolving, is when Cronenberg's style appears and when finally you can say, yeah that's pure Cronenberg. Great visuals, unforgettable images, the interesting relationship between Brundle and Veronica and some humor (remember the 'coffee for your sugar' and the 'I live with my mother too'?) makes this last part of the film a really magnificent one. David's fascination for the flesh is here and is because of the flesh that Brundle finally could improve the Telepods and also the two main characters had a fascination for the flesh, of course in different ways with Veronica before the fly went inside one Telepod and Brundle after his experiences with the Telepods. Long live the new flesh? I don't think so.Conclusion: Cronenberg claims, in the interview featured on the Region 4 DVD of The Fly, that he has made pure action films (Scanners), character films (The Dead Zone) and films with a visual part as no other released before (Videodrome) so for David 'The Fly' has the three things combined. I think he is absolute correct so for my money 'The Fly' is one of Cronenberg's best films and definitely one of his most accessible works and one of my personal favourites. If you ask which version of the fly you should see, I would say that you need to see both the 1958 and the 1986 version because both are truly fantastic.Region 4 DVD: is a single-disc edition but is pretty good. Extras are the theatrical trailer, a behind the scenes and five short interviews with Stuart Cornfeld, Cronenberg, Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis and Chris Walas.",Null,0,1,29 May 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's best???? well it's a really hard question
","I saw Death Proof last month and the first person that i want to comment about the film was my cousin, because he is a horror films fan and like me , he loves films and love Quentin Tarantino. The first thing that he told was: Tarantino is in decadence? I say, that Death Proof was a good film but he told that wasn't a Grindhouse film. Well we talk about Tarantino and i think that is difficult for a director to stay in the top for almost 15 years i well, i think that the masterpieces of Tarantino came very early for a regular director. Almost all the greatest directors in all the planet have like a good beginning but later, like 4 films later, it comes their masterpiece, like Scorsese with Taxi Driver, Coppola with The Godfather or Chaplin with City Lights.In my opinion a young director will grow up like 3 or 4 films later but i doesn't means that their first works aren't good like Mean Steets of Scorsese, that is a great film but is not his best.With Tarantino is was all different: his first film is a classic right now and his second film (i mean Pulp Fiction) is his masterpiece and also a classic.Then Jackie Brown, Kill Bill 1 and 2 and now Death Proof are all really great films but for me this 4 films can't be compared whit his first 2 films: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.The conclusion of this question that says me my cousin is that: Tarantino makes his best work in his first 3 years like a director with is two masterpieces Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but i don't think that Tarantino is in decadence for a simple reason: His latest works aren't so good like the firsts ones but still are really good films.Sorry and well now about the film Reservoir Dogs: This film contains an excellent cast that includes one of my favorites actors: Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. Also Michael Madsen, Chris Pen and Tarantino are very good but like a surprise the cast isn't the best part of the film, the best part are the dialogs.The dialogs of the song of Madonna or the dialog with Mr Pink about the tips are excellent and really funny.The films is short and you never bored with Tarantino. Excellent performances, excellent debut and is this Tarantino's best?? this is a hard question but i think that the best is Pulp Fiction but Reservoir Dogs is very close.Reservoir Dogs: 10",10,2,5,15 May 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Mangia! Mangia!
","Has anyone ever recommended you Pier Paolo Pasolini's very last film? I mean, recommended it to you personally? I think it's very unlikely to know someone who is an actual fan of SALO, OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM. I don't know anyone, and I really can't recommend it myself. I think it's the kind of picture that anyone who watches it nowadays was brought to it by themselves, thanks to all of the commentaries that it has generated. In other words, it is the kind of film that anyone with a respectable interest in cinema will watch at some point. Hell, there's even good history about its home-video releases (apparently the very first edition that the Criterion Collection released is one of the most rare, and so expensive, DVDs around). I know about 'Salo' since years ago, even own a R4 DVD of it since years ago. But somehow I always wanted to see it on a Criterion release. I mean, I HAD to check it out at some point no matter what and last Christmas I finally got the Criterion Blu-Ray of it.First of all, I must point out that this is perhaps the most stunning Criterion I have seen to date. The quality of the image is simply fantastic! Watching images of the film from some of the bonus features (that certainly are not in HD) makes you see the incredible difference it is Blu-Ray paradise, and perhaps, in general terms, that's the best thing about the actual film. Near the beginning there's an image that looks just like a painting. It is quite known that Pasolini always wanted that and he truly succeeded. Second, I'm pretty much always interested in anything related with WWII and so in a way I always wanted to check out that element in 'Salo' (which is set in 1944-1945, in the Republic of Salo aka Nazi-Occupied Italy). I knew all the criticism, which is greatly resumed in the back of the Criterion box: 'the notorious final film from Pasolini has been called nauseating, shocking, depraved, pornographic'. But I thought this was closer to a great critic to fascism than to all of that. But, it is? The answer for me is both yes and no. Finding similitude in everything that happen in the book 'The 120 Days of Sodom' by the Marquis de Sade (I haven't read it nor anything by the Marquis de Sade though) to the stuff the fascists did is certainly a great starting point. At the beginning it captures greatly the horrors, as we see kids put away from their lives and the 'nobody knows you're here since for the world you're already dead' thing, once the kids are locked up for the pleasures of, especially, four sick fascists -I guess that's just a pleonasm- (almost at the very beginning the marry each other's daughters, so you can tell!). But then is just the show of these four men. There isn't much about the victims; we don't get to know much about any of them aside of little details, like, for instance, we know there's a blonde girl who suffered the lost of her mother. But, and like I said, 'Salo' is mainly just the show of the four main characters, who do nothing but give sexual, mental and physical torture. At some point of all of this makes us forget that this is set during the time of the Nazi occupation in Italy; there's a scene in which one the men (the 'president' played by Aldo Valletti) puts his pants down and stars showing his ass to everyone to later implore for anal sex. Later you have the four men dressed with women's clothes! 'Salo' is ridiculously funny at times. I'm thinking a lot in a 2008 French film. It's a brutal one and it's called MARTYRS. The main relation between that one and 'Salo' is that both deal with people of power who torture their victims for pleasure. As pure horror (torture) cinema, 'Salo' ain't as great as some others, like that French one for instance. And in the end, Pasolini's film is much closer to be pure horror than to be a great statement on Fascist Italy. I remember being really disturbed with MARTYRS (and believe me: I'm not an easy target!) not only because of the shocking scenes but also, and mostly, because of the entire story behind, the story behind the people of power. With 'Salo' I would have preferred something like that.",Null,0,1,3 January 2012
Rocky," Adrian!!! Adrian!!!
","I saw this film long time ago so long time ago that I barely remember it so basically watching Rocky just last night was like watching it for the very first time. I had like a prejudice, I considered the Academy Award for best picture of Rocky to be just one of the many jokes that the Academy has made and not particularly funny jokes. Taxi Driver is one of my all time favourites so you can imagine the rest. Now after watching finally Rocky I still believe its Oscar is a big joke however is easy to see why it won and easy to say that the Academy Awards are just a big piece of s***. Before you stop reading my comment I will write that I do like this film and truly a lot. I had a lot of fun by watching this with a couple of friends. It is definitely a film with a lot of memorable stuff that everybody knows, many famous sequences and that music theme. I love how it begins but essentially nothing really happens we just watch Rocky in his daily routine; boxing is just one way to get some dollars but not any more a possible way to have something bigger in life. In short, Rocky is not any more thinking just in boxing, he has to get money of course and he uses his strength for other little jobs for Gazzo (Joe Spineli). On the other hand we meet a present star of boxing, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) but actually we meet him not as the boxer but more as the 'businessman' that sees beyond the sport. Sure he is the champion and when he sees the chance to be not only a great boxer but also a patriot. He sees the chance to show why America is the land of opportunity and, of course, he don't think twice in order to make a decision. Now he is the Uncle Sam and he will give the opportunity of his life to a working class Italian, American with that Apollo Creed will be the hero, the champion, the spectacle, the star, etc. However he is not a likable character at all mostly because almost we never watch him as the boxer. Of course Rocky is that Italian American, 'the Italian Stallion' who doesn't even imagine what his nickname will make, yes he will find finally some luck and for sure I won't miss the chance. But it is not just boxing, actually during the entire 120 minutes of the film we only watch a couple of fights of Rocky; is also a love story that is even quite funny. Funny because you watch how people change for love, one day Adrian (Taila Shire) wears glasses and the other day she doesn't need glasses any more! Rocky changed her a lot and on that way he is my f****** idol (first date first kiss and she was an extremely shy girl!). The brother of Adrian (Burt Young) is always following Rocky and always repeating the same things to 'the Italian Stallion', thanks to that he is another funny character of the film but there are many repetitive dialogs during it that I found extremely fun to watch. Do you know who is Julio Cesar Chavez? Well if you don't he was a great Mexican boxer and recently he worked as commentator of TV for the Olympic boxing. I saw a fight of one Mexican who, unfortunately, was beaten but it was absolute fun hearing Chavez. He said that the Mexican loose the fight because 'no quebro la cintura' (he doesn't bend at the waist) and the fun thing was that he repeated that like 10 times during the fight! It was really funny and during this film we have some similar situations. The one that made me remember Chavez was the conversation of Rocky with Mickey (Burgess Meredith), he repeats a lot that Rocky will need a trainer. Of course these two will have finally a special friendship and here the real training begins so the memorable sequences begins. A boxer who wanted to make a real fight against the star, he did that butI like this film a lot but I just don't found in it the masterpiece and inspirational piece of cinema that many found. The first Rocky is a lot of fun with that mentioned memorable stuff. Are you talking to me? Is curious to hear Rocky saying that. Anyway, watch it friends.PS: I didn't know that Lloyd Kaufman appears on this one, credited as the drunk. I'm just realizing about that fact and definitely I would like to check his appearance.",Null,0,0,12 September 2008
Jack Reacher," Tom Cruise might not be 'Dirty Harry', but his attempt wasn't that bad: 6.5 out of 10
","The trailer of JACK REACHER, the new Tom Cruise production starring (of course) Tom Cruise, played in pretty much every darn screening during the past few months. This trailer left no doubt that this was a genre movie, that was going to be out there just to satisfy its target audience; action and cars fans, and of course those Cruise admirers. However there was an element that indicated that it could be something much more interesting: the participation of the legendary Werner Herzog as the main antagonist of the story. It's quite strange for Herzog to act (although not long ago he did it for the film MISTER LONELY), and I don't think there's someone who imagined that someday he would work alongside Cruise on a 100 million dollar movie. At the same time it's not hard to imagine Herzog, with his distinct voice, as a villain, and the general idea (I'm saying this as a huge Herzog fan) seemed the only remarkable thing of the movie. I think Christopher McQuarrie (director and writer – it was based on the novel 'One Shot' by Lee Child) didn't give Herzog enough screen time. The development and conclusion to his character are quite disappointing (pretty much nothing happens with him), even with the promising beginning and with the fact that, indeed, the German filmmaker looks sensational in his antagonistic role. This character is only known as 'the Zec' ('the prisoner') and his mythology is similar to some other fictional crime bosses. The character only known as 'the Greek' from THE WIRE, for instance, is also a mysterious European that operates in the US – an almost mythical figure that with a low profile controls part of the criminal world. It's a cool mythology but ultimately 'the Zec' is just another extra in Cruise's spectacle. So let's forget about Herzog to focus in what JACK REACHER really offers. The movie opens with the sequence of a sniper doing a killing job. At one point we get to see the sniper's point of view and how each one of his victims (five in total) gets killed. If an opening like this one doesn't makes you think in the Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood classic DIRTY HARRY, well, is simply because you haven't seen that 1971 picture! In general terms, JACK REACHER feels like a descendant of 'Harry' – and it's pretty obvious that it will be a franchise too. Reacher ain't officially a detective (he served in the military), however he acts like one; therefore the movie moves just like any other that involves someone trying to solve a murder mystery. The protagonists, Reacher and the lawyer Helen Rodin (played by Rosamound Pike), will try to complete the puzzle and find the truth about the sniper and the five victims. There's nothing quite innovative and its few 'surprises' remain inoffensive; but it's enjoyable, especially if you like classic detective moments. The work of Tom Cruise also makes me think in DIRTY HARRY. No, I'm not comparing Cruise with Eastwood, is just that Reacher's attitude is somewhat similar to Harry Callahan's. However, you don't buy to the 50-year-old Cruise the idea that he's a dirty ol' bastard who couldn't care less for the law and literally smashes the heads of his rivals. When JACK REACHER tries to deliver the absurdist humor (that we could see in the trailer too), Cruise doesn't have any trouble to accomplish the mission; I'm not saying the result is always effective, as sometimes is just absurd, but for that kind of material, Cruise is all right. Robert Duvall is, by the way, pretty cool here. Like I said, JACK REACHER has elements from those action movies from the seventies; and yes, it has a car chase too. Quentin Tarantino made it clear with DEATH PROOF that if you want to pay homage to the classics (like VANISHING POINT or DIRTY MARRY CRAZY LARRY) you better forget the CGI. It seems McQuarrie understood that; and Cruise didn't require any stunt double and drove the chase. This is certainly remarkable, but nevertheless the car chase with Zoe Bell and Kurt Russell from DEATH PROOF is still, and by far, the best, most exciting and impressive car chase that Hollywood has given us in the last ten years. So just like its car chase, the new Tom Cruise production is something the fans of action and mystery movies will appreciate but will soon forget.*Watched it on 09 January, 2013",Null,0,5,13 January 2013
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Luck, Irony and Two Old Shotguns
","After being in love with 'Snatch', my cousin and I began to look out for this film and finally we saw it on a bootleg of the imported DVD. That was about 3 or 4 years ago and the last year I saw for the very first time the Region 4 DVD so I get my own copy of the film and enjoyed for the second time. Last week I saw 'The Transporter' and I decide to enjoy once again this magnificent work so I'm here writing, after a third view, my thoughts about Guy Ritchie's first feature film.The story introduce you this four friends: Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher). They have different ways to get money but finally they decide to enter in a big game. They put together £100,000 to play a card game, taking advantage of the great abilities of Eddie. But they are playing against 'Hatchet' Harry (P.H. Moriarty) who is a porn king and now they owns him £500,000 and Harry is the kind of man that if you own him you better pay him. I really love how the story makes that you care and, at the same time, feel sorry for the four friends because they put in that card game all of their savings and now they need a real miracle to get the money in only one week. At the same time were are watching this, we also watch some other characters that, if you think first, doesn't have anything related with the four friends but you will see how little is the world. There are many secondary characters but basically there are just group of friends and partners: the drug growers, the criminal neighbors of Eddie, the two guys from the North and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) with his son, Little Chris. And all know Harry and Rory (Vas Blackwood) that are the 'big bosses'. There are two more characters that are the ones that connect everything, specially the second one: Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) and Nick the Greek (Stephen Marcus). This story might look a little complicated with a lot of connected subplots but the way that is shown is just perfect, enjoyable and easy to follow. The style of Guy Ritchie is just so cool, for example the first sequence is just brilliant, and there are many funny situations just as many ironies in the entire story, being the one in the very end the biggest of all.Cast: Just brilliant. Eddie could be the main character and Nick Moran is just great. Jason Statham is great but he has a support role as part of the four friends so he doesn't stand out of the four because the four are a team and are great. As I watched first 'Snatch' I found here many familiar faces like Vinnie Jones and Alan Ford. The last one has a very small role as the bartender but he is also the narrator with his unique voice. Also Sting appears as Eddie's father making a really good performance and 'the hardest man in Britain', Lenny McLean, is terrific as Barry.Conclusion: Well for me this is nothing but a brilliant film. Great story, great characters, funny situations with a lot of irony. I mention in this comment many times the film 'Snatch' and the only reason is because is a similar film, brilliant too so I highly recommend both. In this case 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' deserves a perfect and beautiful 10.",10,4,4,24 April 2008
Zombieland," Zombieland
","Out of AVATAR, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, SHERLOCK HOLMES and ZOMBIELAND the one I liked the most was 's debut feature, hell, it's simply the only one of the ones I've seen recently on the big screen (which are the mentioned ones) that I loved. Is this the American SHAUN OF THE DEAD? Well, it is indeed a zombie film to have lots of fun with and is not quite like the Canadian FIDO, that is also a fun zombie film but that is more about a world than just about trying to survive the zombies. So yes, ZOMBIELAND is in the vein of that Edgar Wright film (that, btw, I really have to re-watch. I watched it for the first and so far only time back in December 2005, so is time to visit it again) with our characters just trying to survive. Of course this is not a quite similar: ZOMBIELAND is basically a road movie, with characters that are indeed surviving the zombie holocaust yet that are not around zombies all the time. I mean, this is more about what's next for the survivors in the United States of Zombieland, about the relationship between the survivors but well, of course there's plenty of extremely cool zombie slashing! So don't worry. The film is fun almost all the time. One of the main characters said it just about right: ''. Of course a zombie holocaust is not a very funny issue, well before I go on I want to write a bit about the main characters. Plays the hero, a thin boy who is basically like the character Michael Cera always plays. And yes, there's a familiar face here if you are into Apatow productions. The love interest of Jonah Hill in SUPERBAD is here, plays , the love interest of . and her little sister () will be a real headache for the . everyone of them has something sad to tell thanks to the zombie holocaust",9,2,4,10 January 2010
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Tenacious D in The Best Comedy of the Year 2006
","When i heard that Jack Black was working on another rock comedy i was totally excited because i really love 'The School of Rock'. But later i just forget about it because it wasn't release in Mexico and also because i knew Tenacious D as the Jack Black band but i never heard anything of Tenacious D music. Until one month ago that i heard the song 'The Metal' in the Guitar Hero demo and i really like it so i came here to investigate about the film but in the film releases it wasn't Mexico. I start looking the DVD and finally one week ago i get it. I saw the film that same day and i really enjoy it.For me this is one of the best comedies of the year, along with Borat film and Nacho Libre, also with Jack Black.I think i enjoy this film so much because i love rock music so i find this as a tribute to all the people who have the rock music in their hearts. And of course, because is nothing but hilarious; with Jack Black that for me is one the best comedians right now and also a great musician.The plot is really funny, is about the start of Tenacious D, how JB and KG know each other and also involves one of the darkest (and funniest)secrets in rock history about the Pick of Destiny.The cast is great, like i said Jack Black is hilarious and the same of Kyle Gass. And with many cameos like Ronnie James Dio, Meat Loaft, Ben Stiler, Tim Robbins and Dave Grohl as the devil. For me the most hilarious is the one of Tim Robbins, is just great and very different of all the work of Tim.About the music: as i said, i never heard anything of Tenacious D but now i'm a fan and i want all their albums. The lyrics are really funny and they play really good, specially the last song in the film with Dave Grohl's voice and drum is amazing.As a conclusion: i think that you don't need to be a hard core fan of the band to enjoy the film but i'm pretty sure that i enjoy a lot this film because i love rock music. Excellent comedy. 10/10DVD: Excellent, i love all the deleted scenes and the making of the film and soundtrack. Also contains the music video of the song 'P.O.D.' and comments of Jack Black, Kyle Gass and the director Liam Lynch.",Null,0,0,29 November 2007
The Departed," Scorsese's best film????? for the Oscars yes, for me no but....
","Is difficult to say what is the best film of Marty, in my opinion there are three films: Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Raging Bull, maybe Gangs of NY, Casino and The Departed also, but in my opinion the first three are the best. Well about The Departed: this film is one of my favorite films of the 2006, with a great performance by Dicaprio and by Jack Nicholson and of course a great history about mafia, corruption and cops. I have seen this film like three times and every time i found a lot of news things and i think that is why this film is a masterpiece but for me is not the best of Marty. And of course we have to give some credit to 'Infernal Affairs' in which this film was based and that is also a great film.About that this film won the best picture Oscar: for me the prizes are not important, because the art of a movie can't be compared with others, and for me the Oscar or the golden palm or all the other prizes are not important because when a movie is excellent, it is excellent with or without prizes.... but is a shame that a lot of people don't think that because they only see The Departed ( or whatever film) because The Departed won an Oscar. That is a shame but is true that a lot of people only watch film because some others say that is a good film ( like the jury of the Oscars), but well thats my opinion.",10,2,4,2 March 2007
30 Days of Night," When the sun goes down
","In a little town in Alaska, the people are waiting the annual month without the sun. You can imagine the rest, is the perfect scenery for a group of vampires and now the sheriff in town (Harnett) is going to protect the people of the town.Based on a three-issue miniseries of comics written by Steven Niles, this film is really good and very direct which i like because the plot is straight to the point: the vampires need some blood. But also show to us how the people behavior in a situation like that one.The cast is good, with Harnett playing a non typical hero and the vampires look really cool. The unique think that i don't like of the vampires was their strange eye browns; and the visual part of the film is really good.I haven't read the comics so i can't compare to them. so the unique thing that i can say is that i really enjoy this film, is really well done and is a fresh film in the vampires genre. 8/10PS: i love the end, is not typical because is not a happy one and i think that horror films will never be for everyone.",8,2,3,30 November 2007
Wedding Crashers," Funeral Crashers
","At one point of this David Dobkin 2005 comedy hit (Budget: $40, 000, 000. Gross revenue: $285, 176, 741) Owen Wilson's character John, one of the wedding crashers certainly, asks to the woman he loves (beautiful Rachel McAdams plays Claire Cleary) this: 'would be a total cliché if I kissed you now?' and she says 'Yes' and he kisses her. The end of the movie is there, the end of the very typical movie is there, the good guy is finally with the woman he loves and that woman is finally with the guy she loves and did not make the mistake of getting married with the all good and rich boyfriend of hers that actually is a complete a*****. You know, sure Wedding Crashers is predictable, nothing we haven't seen before and stuff but still it delivers, if you ask me is quite a recommendation for comedy fans that haven't seen it yet.Here we have the wedding crashers, John and Vince Vaughn's character Jeremy and we have first the sort of montage to see these wedding crashers in action, you know lying, enjoying the weddings, getting the girls, they're experts, they really know about weddings. Second stage is the reflection of one of them, John to be exact, the thoughts after the just finished 'wedding season', 'we are irresponsible, we are not that young' that sort of thoughts. Later there's a wedding out of the 'season', certainly the big special one, certainly the one that will deliver the main story and is John in love and Jeremy pretty much suffering a bit with two nuts (Gloria Cleary and Todd Cleary, played by Isla Fisher and Keir O'Donnell). I repeat, this is typical so there will be the classic moment when the girl that John fell in love with and the rest of her family (Christopher Walken plays the dad, the US Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary. As some have pointed, with Walken's character we have the Jack Byrnes of this film, well actually not really but that's just something we think of the moment we meet Walken's character so with that character the movie is not predictable which means we have nothing memorable with this character, nothing as funny as the stuff with his mother!) find out the truth, find out that John and Jeremy are not brothers, are liars, are just wedding crashers (a moment courtesy of the 'villain': Claire's boyfriend and future husband, played by Bradley Cooper) and of course the moment with John being like 'Claire: sure it's true I'm a wedding crasher but the guy you met, the guy that made you laugh and stuff is really who I am' and the moment with John and Jeremy breaking their friendship and well, of course the just f****** hilarious moments! It's a darn funny movie (Vaughn being the one who is especially funny. For instance, I loved his 'conversation' with Janice and with father O'Neil!). Apart of Wedding Crashers I have seen exactly 6 movies that have Will Ferrell in them (and I'm not familiar at all with SNL), pretty much I always find him amusing but never really hilarious until this movie (which I just saw today for the very first time, by the way), here Ferrell is just f****** hilarious! He plays Chazz Beinghold, this guy is like the wedding crashing master, the pioneer and he appears in the movie at the time when John is into books like 'Don' Jump! Life's really worth it'. Chazz is totally in another level, he is now a damn funeral crasher! So f***** up, so f***** up, anyway Wedding Crashers is a worthy comedy choice.",8,0,0,1 July 2009
There Will Be Blood," Jesus save us from your followers!
","I have a lot of desires to watch this film since i knew that PTA was working in it. The last Friday was finally released in Mexico City due to the Oscars but i was pretty surprised that is only in about 10 theaters in all the city. To make a comparison, the film 'Vantage Point' is in about 50 theaters, it's a real shame. Anyway, today i finally have the chance to watch this film in the an art theater and i love it.Set in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the film follows Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), an oil man who finds the success in the oil business in California by 1911. When Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) tells Daniel that his family's property in Little Boston have oil, Daniel decide to go to Little Boston to buy the property and the rest of the houses near to ensure the manage of the oil in Little Boston. So we are going to see the change of Daniel when finally finds the total success and how he must deal with universal themes as family, religion and his own greed.The script of this brilliant film was based upon the 1927 novel 'Oil!' by Upton Sincalir and is a great story of a man who change everything for money. First he is a normal man who has a partner a kid named H.W. who was helped by Daniel after the dead of his father. They reminds the 1921 film 'The Kid' in which Chaplin have an orphan kid as a partner of his work. They try to sell the American Dream to the people but, in accordance of Daniel's rise, he is has a total different personality of at least he can act as he wants and yes, there will be blood. The rest of the characters represents universal themes as religion or family. Eli Sunday (Paul Dano too) is the represent of religion as a prophet who plays with people's faith and doesn't support his own father when and says to him: 'God doesn't save stupid people.' In the end that same phrase can resume Eli. And the family plays another important role in the film, Danile finds the son he doesn't have in H.W. and they become real family. Later when his half-brother Henry appears, he feel remorse because of his past with his real family. But actually during the film we can't see any real member of Daniel's family and he loose for money those who replace his real family.And all with a beautiful cinematography with some very dark scenes and others with the sunshine. The recreation of the period is amazing just as the superb cast. Daniel Day-Lewis is memorable like his character and in his case that Oscar really means what it supposed to mean, yes Day-Lewis has the best performance of the year. For me he is just like in 'Gangs of New York' as Bill the Butcher. And the other main role is played in a superb way by the young Paul Dano. I have only seen Dano in 'Little Miss Sunshine', in which he was good but he really grow up a lot in acting to make this very difficult role.Conclusion: i love this film, i haven't watch all the films of PTA but by now this is my third favourite and one of my favourites of 2007. A memorable story with epic sizes filmed in a perfect way. It's long, 158 minutes, but it doesn't feels to be that long. Well i'm going to drink a milkshake. 10 out of 10PS: the Mexican title is 'Petroleo Sangriento', that means 'Bloody Oil.'",10,1,7,26 February 2008
Ice Age," 'you know humans can't talk'
","I saw this one when it was brand new back in 2002. Yesterday I saw the new Ice Age, Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and in my comment of Dawn of the Dinosaurs I wrote this: 'I was pretty much a fan of the first Ice Age, right now I have one adjective to describe each: for the first one (released in 2002) the adjective is great and for the first sequel (released in 2006 and called The Meltdown) the adjective is boring'. So today I decided to watch again Ice Age and it wasn't the same, it wasn't like in 2002. And I wasn't a very little kid back in 2002 but still 7 years are 7 years and certainly I remembered a much better movie, I remembered a much funnier squirrel but now I can say this isn't even better than Dawn of the Dinosaurs, of course this doesn't looks as good as 'Dinosaurs' (still it is a good-looking movie) and well this is just an OK movie, entertaining at least.It's very simple, simple elements: three different animals, a mammoth, a sloth and a saber tooth tiger, will have a common goal which is returning a lost baby to his people. The saber tooth tiger while at first with a different goal will end being good, you know it is basic. The squirrel works a bit better here than in 'Dinosaurs', it feels that it is a bit more stick with the main story. But still apart of that scene when the main characters ask it about the humans and of its very last expression (that happens 20, 000 years later of the events in the movie) the squirrel is never hilarious.So, yesterday I was thinking 'the first one was much better than its sequels' but now I'm not, this is far from being a great.",6,0,0,7 July 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," Kill Will
","Oh this is an excellent film, i really like because it is very interesting from the beginning until the last scene. How do you kill Will Ferrell? this is the main problem of his strange and alcoholic author. In this bizarre story, you found Harold (Ferrell) who starts hearing a voice o a woman who is the narrator of his own life. He is a very boring man whit the same routine every day: wake ups, go to take the bus for his work and return to his home. He don't have any ambitions or dreams until the voice appears and look for help whit a professor (Dustin Hoffman). Hoffman is really good, i mean, maybe is his best work in a long time.Well i don't want to say more about the plot so i want to say why this is a good film.The themes that the film touch are very good, and the final message that for me was like forget about your every day routine and look out for what you really want to do or want you really need like love , in the case of Harold was to learn to play the guitar and find his love. I really like that message or the other whit the authors; that they really create people whit feels, i mean that authors are worrying about their characters like they were real people (in this case he was a real person).About the cast, well is just excellent; Will Ferrell plays one of his best characters ever and Hoffman is just amazing. The rest of the cast, well i don't know the names but Harold's girl is really good and the author too.Finally. see this film i think you wont be disappointed and forget about that things that you hate and look for love and for a Fender Stratocaster.DVD: great, whit nice bonus material that deserves to be in my collection.",9,0,1,1 October 2007
The Wrestler," The 80s
","<ul><li>Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today and then one day you find ten years have got behind you, no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.</li></ul>And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking. And racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older, shorter of breath and one day closer to death. -Time, 20 years ago, the 80s, good times or bad times but unique times for sure. Guns N' Roses' track from their album Appetite for Destruction 'Sweet Child O' Mine' reached the #1 position of the Billboard hot 100 and like Guns N' Roses' our main character was in the 80s at the top of his career, as a professional wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) had a tremendous time during the 80s, memorable matches, success. At one point we have Randy and his friend (Marisa Tomei) hanging in a bar, they have a similar taste for music and Randy says something like 'I hated the f****** 90s' and also stuff against Cobain. We can imagine that Randy said that not only in reference to the music but also to how he lived during the decade after his best decade as a professional wrestler. The present for Randy consist in living alone, working at a supermarket and wrestling during the weekends at local small places. Three wrestling matches in the film; we certainly take a look inside the world of wrestling, we see how there is a big respect to Randy from all the wrestlers we see, the respect is mutual, after all they all are colleagues. As you know pro wrestling is a show, here there's always the previous chat between Randy and his next rival about what they are going to do for the audience (there's also that detail of Randy cutting himself). Personally I like pro wrestling, I enjoy sometimes the whole show (and the movies of Santo and Blue Demon!) but I don't really have a favourite wrestler, I'm just not a big fan, I can't be. Anyway, here especially with the second match we see pro wrestling as nothing but a real thing, I like this part of Roger Ebert's review of The Wrestler: 'Pro wrestling is a fake sport, right? Yes, but as an activity, it's pretty real. It's scripted that the villain sneaks up on the hero, who pretends not to see him, and pushes him over the ropes and out of the ring. Fake. But when the hero hits the floor, how fake is that? 'Those guys learn how to fall,' people tell me. Want to sign up for the lessons?'. That mentioned second match is an extreme one, a delight for the fans (a really fantastic little moment when Randy please his fans by using the prosthetic leg of one of them, who is the happiest fan in the place, to hit his rival!) but after this match we are pretty sure the days of Randy as a professional wrestler are over. The situation in the present days of Randy was always difficult, how a once very successful professional wrestler ended suffering to pay the rent is not for our interest, the only thing we have now is that a man has nothing but more disappointments during an already difficult period of his life. Now the body says 'no more'; a situation like the bypass operation that had Randy, as Marisa Tomei's characters remarks, usually bring people together. I haven't seen yet Gus Van Sant's Milk, actually I don't really want to see it (I only really want to see, from those movies that are right now in theaters, Watchmen and Clint Eastwood's Changeling). I'm writing this in reference to what happened exactly two weeks ago in the Oscars, certainly Rourke was the favourite and with that you know that enough has been said about how Rourke resurrected with this project. He is GREAT, I didn't expect less. Marisa Tomei plays the character of the striper who has this special relation with one of her customers who is of course Randy. Tomei is really good but for me is not a great performance (still she deserved the damn Oscar just for those lap dance scenes). Certainly these two, Randy and Pam, share things (there's this one scene in which some customers don't want Pam since she is old. Also Pam has a son), and there's that thing with Pam saying: 'I can't, you're just another customer, I can't be with customers' and Randy responding 'well I'm a customer then I want a f****** dance'. She is also the one who will lead is know that Randy has a daughter (good performance of beautiful Evan Rachel Wood), probably of the thing that Randy is more regretful about is that he practically abandoned his daughter, now we know Randy and we had been following him so we know he really want the best for the difficult relation with his daughter and there's that moment after for once Randy saw something outside a ring, pretty much a damn unfortunate moment that will make that Randy sees the wresting world again as his only world. Not entirely a masterpiece but The Wrestler is just another worth watching work from Darren Aronofsky.",10,0,0,8 March 2009
Hancock," If the Dark Knight was the party, Hancock is the hangover
","*** Written on 21 July 2008***My title is, of course, on a personal level and not only because are my feelings about two films but also because and actually Hancock was released exactly one week before The Dark Knight yet I went to see TDK the day of its release and Hancock just last Sunday. But also my title is perfect for this film itself since we have a promising beginning that works because it is pure fun so is the party yet every party has an end and unfortunately this time is a mess. Definitely I'm not a fan of Will Smith and also I kind of dislike him pretty much and his previous big-budget film, I'm Legend, was not even near to be a good film and was a complete disappointment so is kind of obvious why I wasn't very excited about Hancock so I never felt desires to watch it on the weekend of its release in my country (also and mostly because Hellboy II was released the same Friday). Yesterday was a perfect Sunday for going to the cinema and more in the way of this-is-the-next-film-playing we finally saw Hancock. As I write, the first part of the film is actually really entertaining with a lot of fun and Smith carrying -in a good way- the film. In this part Hancock is a true bastard, a 'superhero' who everybody hates and with a good reason since the bastard doesn't even respect kids and that's a funny scene, Hancock messing around with young Michael Myers. Still is fun when Hancock tries to be finally a normal superhero yet his story with Mary (Charlize Theron) tries to be as epic as memorable as moving but is actually quite ridiculous but also is not interesting all the background story of this two and the fact that there are not great enemies is just another bad point of the film.Cast: after all Smith is good yet and like always he is not great. The extremely beautiful Charlize Theron has a decent performance in a part that I didn't liked and the rest of the cast is also decent but there are nothing more for remember, maybe just that French bully played by Daeg Michael Myers Faerch.Then is Hancock worth to watch on the big screen? Well probably is but is far from other better films playing right now in my country (for example Hellboy II: The Golden Army). Is a complete waste of time? No because it has fun stuff yet is very very far from my favourites of this 2008 summer (The Dark Knight, WALL·E, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Speed Racer), those that are on my 'DVD to purchase' list so I probably will never watch again this film.",Null,3,4,22 July 2008
Sherlock Holmes," Just enjoy Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson!
","Sherlock Holmes, a name everybody knows but even so a name that Guy Ritchie just introduced to me. Yes, Ritchie's new film was not only the very first film I saw in 2010, in the decade (saw it last night at a full theater), but also my very first encounter with something of Sherlock Holmes. Yes, some not even care about who is the director of this huge new Sherlock Holmes production, but as a Ritchie fan I must say that of all his after Snatch productions (with the exception of , the film Ritchie made for his wife of the time and the only one I haven't seen... wait, I don't have to see it to know it's a piece of crap! Then yes, forget the exceptions!) this was the one I liked the most (with ROCKNROLLA right after it), still it could have been better. Some weeks ago I saw an interview with Ritchie in which he talks about the 2009 film of his 'rival' director Quentin Tarantino. He remarks that the think I liked about INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, and that is jealous about, is the richness of its characters. In SHERLOCK HOLMES he was more interested in the richness of his characters than in anything else. Downey Jr. and Law are amazing here, and if Ritchie succeeded in at least in one regard is definitely the richness of his Holmes and Watson. Well, maybe richness is not the correct adjective for the case of Watson but nevertheless this film is worth watching for, if for nothing more, its two main characters. Is extremely enjoyable to see Downey and Law here, so basically if these two are back for the sequel I will be watching it, no matter if Ritchie decides not to care that much for the story again.",8,4,7,2 January 2010
WALL·E," Define Cinema... Beauty
","First I want to write something about Pixar movies. I have seen all those movies, with the little exception of 'Cars' (John Lasseter, 2006), but I don't own anything of Pixar on DVD yet I have some of their old movies on VHS, well actually just three of them. Is obvious that I was a bigger fan of Pixar when I was very young but is also obvious that Pixar movies were and still are great. In this case, like 'Ratatouille' (Brad Bird, 2007), 'WALL·E' wasn't the summer movie with the biggest publicity, received terrific reviews but unlike 'Ratatouille' this one was placed on the first 10 of IMDb top 250 (at one point I saw it on the number 6). Before all those praises I do wanted to watch this one on the big screen but I can't deny that when I saw its place on this site and all the great comments in its first week, I saved a time to watch it today, the day of its release in my country. The main character of this one, the 2008 Pixar film, is alone in the planet Earth. It is a WALL·E (voice of Ben Burtt) but now we can say that HE is a WALL·E. His robot routine is simple but his curiosity is not and now he can recognize what is a dance and he knows and loves music. EVE (voice of Elissa Knight), the other main character, arrives and again it has a routine, its nature as a robot unit, but that insect, kind of WALL·E's unique friend/partner in Earth, proves that SHE can be different. The robots themselves are of course what the humans could produce but they are the humans of the movie, the ones that are exploring something new, something different and the ones that appreciate the things of the human race. The music plays a very important role for WALL·E and that is just unique and definitely is great for the movie. Here there is a romance and is funny to see the things that a romance can cause since she doesn't know what is WALL·E feeling. This two are like children exploring the world and if something unknown happens to one, the other will be worry. The story moves with the descendants of the human race. In their ship they are living like kings, the robots make all the work and they can have any 'experience' without even make a move so in consequence they just can't stand up. They are something new, they are not humans but when they finally have the option to return to the Earth, they finally know something about their ancestors and they see the human race like a legendary civilization that once has a truly beautiful life with beautiful things to do and with a beautiful planet. Now they want to be back in Earth and they can but soon they will realize that Earth is not any more like in the legends, no it was completely destroyed by the human race. Also they will know the plans of the antagonist of the story, AUTO, but still they have the concern of knowing that they can return to home and they will fight for that, of course with the little help of WALL·E and the big help of EVE, that meanwhile have their own story, a story of friendship. Back in home is a new beginning and those fat things will be finally humans. The only question may be the following: those persons learned the lesson or everything would be the same? In the end they are humans and destruction is there. Conclusion: Then is easy to know why people love 'WALL·E' and is easy to say that is a great picture since it is Pixar. After writing that, I mean Pixar, it is almost unnecessary to write something about the magnificent animation but there is also some live action that I found kind of strange since those 'real' humans were from long time ago and now humans are only those -animated- fat 'things'. Anyway, 'WALL·E' was absolutely worth watching and I'm glad that a popular film is great. Just for the record, a lot of kids were crying in the theater and some others screaming the name of EVE so if that say to you something, well take your precautions but still this is a movie for everyone. To end, I really can't say that this is the best Pixar film ever, but damn 'WALL·E' is really, really great.",9,1,4,4 July 2008
1408," Don't look for explanations, it's just a fu*k*n' evil room
","I saw this film last night and i have a nice time in the cinema. It was almost the perfect film for the 'dead's day' in Mexico. Is about a man who travels around the places that have a myth or legend about ghosts and that kind of stuff and later write books about those places.Now he is going to the room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel of NY.I love the way the film starts whit Mike Enslin (John Cusack) because you see what kind of writer is, whit his books only in the low prices sections of the books stores. Later when he goes to the 1408, whit the little but great performance of Samuel L. Jackson, is like another film. And in the room is just suspense and torture whit Mike Enslin's deep feelings like the lost of his daughter. I love the end but i not going to say anything.Well this is is a very entertaining film that keep you with suspense all the hour that Enslin spend in the room and also one of the best recent adaptations of Stephen King's work even though this was just a short story.8/10",8,1,2,3 November 2007
The Iron Giant," I Am Not a Gun. I Am Superman!
","Actually just today I finally watched this picture so I actually watched first The Incredibles and Ratatouille, of course both directed by Brad Bird too. I liked this one more than Ratatouille and probably as much as The Incredibles. It has a story based on the friendship and that story is pretty known, this time the background is great so that 'basic' story works in a perfect way. Everything happens in 1957 and as you know everything turns around that Iron Giant (voice of Vin Diesel). The human protagonist is a kid, Hogarth Hughes (voice of Eli Marienthal), who is influenced by science fiction movies and comic book stories -and MAD magazine- and who is going to have the first real contact with the Iron Giant, when he was already the theme in the conversations of the people in the town. The mother of Hogarth (voice of Jennifer Aniston) is use to hear him talking about those stories so when he talks about an Iron Giant she is not very surprised. It is a story of friendship first so the robot is practically a little kid, a really unique one, since he is learning everything, showing enthusiasm on that but of course you can't just make your friend a giant robot who needs metal as food and thinks that he just can remove a train track any time he is hungry (look at the character who was on that train, he looks a little similar to Marty Scorsese!). That's a truly big problem and of course Hogarth will have some problems if his mom or any other person meet his new friend but of course he will find some good people that will understand the robot, of course once they are calm after the obvious shock for meeting the Iron Giant. Actually he will only meet one person and his name is Dean (voice of Harry Connick, Jr.) and he is a really cool character, the opposite of Kent Mansley (voice of Christopher McDonald) who is the classic investigator of a mysterious and ridiculous case that first is making fun of it but once he is affected in a direct way the robot will be no more a joke and it will be a true objective as a product of the paranoia. At this point the Iron Giant turns to be a King Kong and since I haven't meet a person who feels good by watching the end of Kong here nobody will be with the army and here our Giant turns to be a real amazing robot that by then has already the S on his chest - A really great character that delivers even really hilarious moments.The voices are simply good. Is easy to recognize the voice of Jennifer Aniston here but is not the voice of Vin Diesel. For me is still strange to see him in the cast. I really dislike his performances. Anyway, the animation is really terrific and in the end this is a magnificent picture with great and very likable characters. I promise you that your family will love it and with its story it won't be a surprise if your girlfriend cries near the end, believe me. In short, The Iron Giant is one of the best films of 1999.PS: reading some comments for this film I found specially one that gained my attention. On that comment one of the things against this film is that it is 'anti-gun', 'anti-hunting', etc. In my opinion you don't need s*** like guns. I loved this film!!!!!!",Null,0,1,8 August 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," Christopher Nolan's Batman I miss you already!
","The fact that the three movie geeks/reviewers from the Internet that I like the most expressed not-so-good comments on THE DARK KNIGHT RISES gave my waiting yet some more expectation (though I haven't read any full review till this day). TDKR is the kind of film everyone, from hard-core comic book fans to your very own parents, will watch, nevertheless of the professional and non-professional reviews. So in a way I'm trying to make this commentary as short as possible, after all Christopher Nolan's Batman is over since two weeks ago (and since more for American audiences). It's worth pointing out that I watched TDKR two times over its opening weekend in Mexico; first time was in a so-called 'extreme digital cinema' screen and second time at an IMAX theater. I didn't think the IMAX was a must; in fact, I enjoyed the film, visually, much more the first time. And, as for the film in general, I had pretty much the same feeling after the second viewing: while not a perfect masterpiece, TDKR is sometimes as EPIC as a conclusion to a trilogy can get. It definitely gave me some of my very favorite moments of the trilogy – it's a flawed but nevertheless great picture, for my money. I read part of the newspaper article of a critic who said that nobody would dare to make another Batman film in at least 20 years. I think that makes sense, and I dare to say nobody will ever get to make superhero villains as amazing as Nolan's Joker and, thankfully, Bane (played here by Tom Hardy). Nolan himself raised the bar incredibly high, or better said, Heath Ledger did it with the Joker and Nolan here is sort of not afraid as he is opening the film in a way that most likely will bring Legder's Joker to the viewer's mind – both THE DARK KNIGHT and TDKR begin in a very similar way: with Batman's respective rival appearing sort of surprisingly and doing some work. So yes, you'll inevitably think in Ledger and his great Joker but you won't be missing a really memorable villain here. Tom Hardy did, hands down, an incredibly GREAT work – needless to say, he steals the film. Bane, in a way, is the opposite kind of villain: this guy, unlike the Joker, can beat the s*** out of anyone, and most certain out of a haven't-been-around-for-eight-years Batman. Thanks to that fact, TDKR is the kind of film where everything gets as dark as possible, in an epic way: Bane takes full control of Gotham and there are no cops or Batman to help the city – exile or death by exile are the two only options for people like Commissioner Gordon (I thought that was a great sort-of comic book thing). Nevertheless, I would say this is really a crowd-pleasing conclusion disguised as a dark and hopeless one. The kind of film that just won't end like THE DARK KNIGHT, if that makes sense. Is that a good thing? Well, it sure makes the film more predictable but at the same time I did find myself please. Some moments are truly satisfying (the Batman symbol on fire, anyone?) and is like if Nolan actually missed the chance to deliver THE perfect crowd-pleasing movie of the year: he built it up pretty damn well, the climax is superb but then, he just made meaningless, with a simple plot twist, some of the stuff I've liked the most! And that's a fine example of why this could and should have been pretty much flawless entertainment. But anyway, kudos to Nolan, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (from start to finish, his participation is great – it sure left me hungry for some more Batman) and everyone else involved in this greatly special trilogy. PS: kudos as well to those who recognized the mayor from THE WIRE (during the airplane scene)! *Watched it on 27 and 29 July, 2012",9,5,10,12 August 2012
Iron Man," I AM IRON MAN...tara tarara tararara tara rara...
","I'm a casual reader of comic books so definitely I'm not the biggest fan of the Marvel world and I don't know all the details of every Marvel story. Anyway, I do like a lot superheroes and of course their enemies (sometimes even more) but definitely Iron Man is not my favourite, probably is Spider-Man. But since I knew that they were making this film I was kind of exciting, of course for the cast too, about it and for me it was really quick it's release. The fact that it doesn't have the big publicity of films like 'Spider-Man 3' or the upcoming 'The Dark Knight' (even 'Speed Racer' in those days has a bigger publicity with all kind of products), was also good but even with less publicity they just make a good damn thing for their business making it's release today, the day of the children in Mexico and also selling the fact that in the US it doesn't opens until the next Friday. So here I'm writing about it just after returning from the theater after enjoyed a lot this great picture.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is just a genius of technology but also a bastard. He is the ultimate designer of weapons and his company is really powerful but dealing with this kind of clients will be always dangerous. Suddenly he reborn, finally opening his eyes and waking up from a dream full of parties, women and power to realize that he was providing amazing technology to the wrong persons. He is IRON MAN. That story about the present situation with the war is really good having in Stark the kind of businessman who never cares about anything but his company's interests. Definitely this background is not important for a child but of course there is great action and great visuals. And there are many funny things especially for a really cool Downey Jr. and his character's attitude before his experiences with the terrorists. Talking about the cast, I think Downey Jr. is really good for the main role as Stark and as Iron Man, well anybody could look really cool with a suit like that. The Dude, Jeff Bridges, is also a good villain and the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow is just perfect in all the ways.Conclusion: 'Iron Man' is a great pre-summer film, for me much better than the recent Marvel adaptations. I loved the trailer for Black Sabbath's Iron Man and here the closing titles are just terrific (Back in Black is also great but some other music in the film is not) but damn I didn't wait until the very end (but definitely I could watch it again) and now I know that Samuel L. Jackson is also here. F*ck right now I hate him mostly because his story with Troma but that's another story. Anyway I really enjoyed this film and of course I'm ready for the next chapter, maybe the second of 15. It's only the decision of the studio because Downey Jr. is more than ready!",9,12,25,30 April 2008
Toy Story 3," it even has Totoro!
","A couple of days ago I watched TOY STORY 3 for the first time since 2010. It's really great to check it out now, without all the hype and stuff. I was one of the few who weren't EXTREMELY impressed with it back in 2010 (and who didn't like much when filmmaker Quentin Tarantino said it was his very favorite film of the year), but now I can enjoy it much more. I mean, it's not that I didn't like it back then (I watched it twice on the big screen, to tell the truth) but some people of my generation (I have, basically, the same age of character Andy) were saying that they cried with the ending and that it was the best movie ever and stuff; so I found all of that really annoying. Anyway, with TOY STORY 3 I think in that 'an expert always makes it (the difficult) look easy' sort of phrase. Why? Well, the story featured here deals with a natural transition: 10 or so years after the second film we have now Andy getting ready for college and certainly giving all of his attention to stuff like a laptop or a cellphone rather than to his once beloved toys (Woody, Buzz, Jessie and company). It may look like it was an easy decision to work on that transition but other company would have done something else; Pixar itself did a perfect example of the typical uninteresting sequel with CARS 2. And certainly it's not just the decision but also how to develop the thing. Pixar did it just freakin' right here, in their traditional full-of-great-details fashion. Just take for example our introduction to the hard times the toys are going through: it's a desperate situation with a couple of phones and the toys trying to get Andy's attention – the natural transition is exposed perfectly and we immediately feel empathy with the characters plus, the whole thing ends with a pretty darn funny joke about Ebay! So yes, this is terrific stuff. It's also worth noting Pixar's decision to have as new characters a couple of old and very famous toys: Barbie and Ken. Again, the development of the situations with these characters is brilliant; for instance, giving Ken some bullying problems for being a 'girl's toy'! You'll find some truly hilarious material and for me they, Barbie and Ken, steal the show. And those great details are worth nothing too: from seeing Woody's hygiene to the ULTIMATE tribute to Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli! I just LOVED seeing Miyazaki's Totoro here as one of the toys (and even being hugged by Woody); one of the coolest movie things in recent memory. Terrific film: 9.5 out of 10. *Watched it (again) on 11 June, 2012",Null,0,2,14 June 2012
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Not really worth paying the extra money for the 3D version, actually not even worth paying for the 2D version
","I was pretty much a fan of the first Ice Age, right now I have one adjective to describe each: for the first one (released in 2002) the adjective is great and for the first sequel (released in 2006 and called The Meltdown) the adjective is boring. I don't really remember much of those both movies but certainly the feeling of being very disappointed back in 2006 is still present. Now comes for this summer the new and third Ice Age movie, Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and frankly I wasn't interested at all in seeing it however over the past few days I began to have a certain expectation, maybe it was just because Ebert who called it the best of the three Ice Age movies, said that 'it involves some of the best use of 3-D I've seen in an animated feature' and well gave it 3.5/4. I just saw Dawn of the Dinosaurs today in 3D and well this more like The Meltdown, weak storytelling and about the 3D version, well it's certainly a nice-looking movie but with few exceptions (for instance the first appearance of the character Diego) there's nothing really impressive, it's certainly a better choice to save your money and pay for the standard version, actually it's a better choice to save your money (it doesn't even need you now with its gross revue, so far according to wikipedia, of $215, 506, 000!) and wait for a rental. That squirrel is unfunny most of the times here (not really when the squirrel has now to satisfy the orders of its partner!). For me the baby dinosaurs were funnier but only at the beginning of the movie since the plot is about the character Sid getting in real troubles, he felt the loneliness then he stole three dinosaur eggs, the dinosaurs born and they loved their mom! So you can imagine when the real mom comes for her babies, Sid is in troubles so the gang, Manny, Ellie, Diego, Crash and Eddie, comes to rescue him. I'm a fan of Simon Pegg, not quite because of his good performance in the recent Star Trek but certainly because of his stuff under the direction of Edgar Wright. Unfortunately I saw Dawn of the Dinosaurs dubbed in Spanish so I missed Simon Pegg's voice performance as the new character Buck but obviously I didn't missed the great stuff that Buck delivers. This character is one of the good things of the third Ice Age but still maybe next time not even lots and lots of good comments and a four star review of Ebert will make me go to the theater. I guess for this one a rental is just fine6/10, being generous.",6,2,6,6 July 2009
Before Sunrise," 'how about six months?'
","Before Sunrise is one of the most acclaimed films of Richard Linklater, well just his most acclaimed film. The very first time I saw a Linklater film was back in 2004 when I saw on the big screen the School of Rock, back then I came to see that film as a Jack Black one, certainly not as a Linklater one. It was probably because of Quentin Tarantino that Linklater's Dazed and Confused became for me a must-wanted film (it is one of Tarantino's top 10 films), and in 2007 was when Linklater really blew me away and not only because I finally saw Dazed and Confused (I own the amazing Criterion DVD edition, and I think is about time to visit Dazed and Confused again) but also because I saw the awesome A Scanner Darkly (hell, it's also time to see this amazing film again). Two years later I finally saw Before Sunrise (I saw almost one week ago, exactly on 15 July 2009) and more than a year later I saw again a Linklater film. The last one was Bad News Bear (I'm not really a big fan of that film as I'm of Dazed and Confused, A Scanner Darkly and The School of Rock but still I like it) back in January 2008. I came first to a Linklater film that is a remake and had very weak reviews, I mean is very easy to find Bad News Bears on R4 DVD just as is very easy to find Before Sunrise on R4 DVD but frankly every time I came across Before Sunrise it looked like anything but like my cup of tea, I don't know it looked like a really sentimental film, like the kind of film that probably my girlfriend would enjoy much more than me. So while very quickly I got the R4 DVD of Bad News Bears (mostly because I enjoyed a lot Bad Santa back in 2007) it was just some weeks ago when I finally decided to get Before Sunrise, why? I found its R1 DVD in offer so I was like 'hell, it's Linklater and well who knows maybe I will end loving and regretting for not seeing it before'. I have seen few films that have Hawke but recently I was totally blown away by his performance in Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, it's a fantastic performance and here 12 years before Hawke isn't as great yet he and Delpy (apart of this one I have seen only other film with Delpy in it: Broken Flowers) are quite good. Like I think you already know, the set of this is simple: a man (Hawke, certainly, is the American Jesse) meets a woman (Delpy, certainly, is the French Celine) on a train, he ask her to leave the train with him in Vienna, they will be together until the sunrise. I think this is a success in that way that it gets really engaging with nothing but dialog between the two characters. I love the part when both say to the other their feelings, both 'call' to their respective 'friends', they tell to their respective 'friend' what they felt when they meet the other and stuff, is like 'let's sit down and think about this whole thing' and the stuff of 'are you going to see him/her again?' begins, her 'friend' ask her 'you gonna see him again?' and she says 'we haven't talked about that yet'. But they will and they agree to make of that the one and only night together, they acted like 'rational' adults but certainly is not the same to talk about a moment that live that moment, 'how about six months?'. This is a good film but NOTHING REALLY IMPRESSIVE, not a great masterpiece, not my favourite from Linklater. I guess by saying that I do have interest in checking out the sequel (the 2004 Before Sunset) I'm giving a compliment to this film because yes, I want to know what happens once Ethan Hawke's character and Julie Delpy's character see each other again.",Null,0,1,20 July 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Panico y Locura en Barcelona
","At one point in this the latest Woody Allen film Vicky Cristina Barcelona one of the characters sees the world that she always wanted right there in her table but at that moment that world was no longer her perfect world, she was certainly concern, her head was thinking in many things but always the fear was present, to stay means to be in the place that she don't want any more and to go means to try to get what she really wants, is with the man that she always loved or with the man that she is in love with. In this film each character had a time that they will never forget and that certainly they will try to forget, first we meet the Americans, two young and beautiful women, friends that are together in a different continent, Spain is the country and Barcelona is the exact place, we meet Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), the narrator tell us how they are different from each other and we soon see that, Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) is the one who will help in order to show us how both friends are different from each other. None of these three will forget the others, certainly Juan Antonio will be out of the lives of both women in a not very long period of time but for sure if somehow Vicky stops seeing Cristina they will not forget the other. Cristina and Juan Antonio were the ones with the same intentions at the beginning of their relation and at one point the two American friends has their man with them in Barcelona and we see the four together. Penelope Cruz is Maria Elena, we don't see Penelope during the first part of the film but we know about her character since the moment we know more or less who is Juan Antonio, certainly for the two American friends to hear about Juan Antonio is to hear about Maria Elena and to be with Juan Antonio is to hear more about Maria Elena. Penelope is all you want and also very funny but certainly she is not funny for Juan Antonio and Cristina and she will be everything but funny for Vicky however for us she says some really funny things, she says a lot in Spanish and with her craziness everything turns really enjoyable, I think Penelope did my favourite performance of this film. A situation, Maria Elena was and still is in love with Juan Antonio and he is in the same position, the factor that makes this relation finally a stable one is actually a person, is actually Cristina. I remember reading time ago about the scene that was going to appear in Woody's upcoming feature, for sure Scarlett Johansson is incredible sexy in this one. Anyway, Scarlett's character is not sure about anything, she loves this, she enjoys that but she in this part of her life will not find a thing like stability, after all this was just an adventure, a strange summer. Woody let us know enough about each character to can be surprised by some of their actions, after all they are in love, in love with the place also and all share that feeling, Barcelona provokes many things for them, there is music, painting, photograph, love, fear, dreams. Each player of Woody shines, not in a really amazing way and some more than others but each one of them is at least very good. Scarlett is the only one of the main cast whose performance is not the first in a Woody Allen film and I think still Match Point has her most memorable performance of the now three under the direction of Allen. It's not been really a long time since I had my first experience with a Woody Allen film but now every time a Woody film comes to the theaters of my city I certainly save my time. To be honest this was only the third Allen film that I see on the big screen, the first one was Scoop back in January of 2007 and the second one was Cassandra's Dream actually in this same year so Vicky Cristina Barcelona was the second Allen film that was released here in Mexico in 2008, with it I have seen 25 Allen feature films and it is maybe my favourite or at least it is in my top 3 of Allen films from this decade and I have seen all of his films of the 00s. Small Time Crooks was funny but I was expecting a whole lot more from it. For me The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Hollywood Ending and Scoop are extremely enjoyable little gems that I would like to watch again. Anything Else and Melinda and Melinda (a real gem for me) are also films that I really liked and from them I was expecting simply awful films. As for the others film in England I think Match Point is overrated when someone says it is one of Allen's very best but I found there an excellent and strange film and Cassandra's Dream is not as good as Match Point but is worth watching. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is another little gem that you should check. 9.5 out of 10",Null,0,2,8 December 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Street Fighting Fox; this is pure Wes Anderson 'melted gold'!
","I'm writing this after watching FANTASTIC MR. FOX for the, at least, fifth time. Also after reading for the very first time the book by Roald Dalh (I read it at a public library last Thursday – it's very short so I finished it in like an hour – really nice stuff for sure). So I guess you already realized that I'm a huge fan of this movie (and that I will be making some references to the book), but I still want to say this: it's not only one of my favorites from the mighty Wes Anderson but just ever, without a damn doubt. I refer Anderson as 'mighty' just because I have yet not to LOVE one of his films. And I really admire the fact that none of his six feature films (his seventh, MOONRISE KINGDOM, will open the Cannes festival!) feels like a 'minor work'. They do share a lot with each other (just like, for instance, Woody Allen films), but so far Anderson has created six very memorable pieces and each one really stand out by its own. FANTASTIC MR. FOX was certainly the most interesting and strange project as it was Anderson making an animated picture. And the animation, I must say, is simply stunning. It's stop motion paradise, actually. Take for instance that scene of the fight between the characters of Mr. Fox (voice of George Clooney!) and the Rat (an unrecognizable Willem Dafoe). It's simply a lesson on stop-motion; I hate the word (due to its overuse) but I'll have to use it for this: creativity. They did such great work full of creativity in scenes like that fight. I cherish that stuff a lot. The character design is also quite the thing! It made me feel like a kid again since each time I saw the movie I was like 'I want the toys of all the characters!' FANTASTIC MR. FOX is as stop-motion paradise as film adaptation paradise. Since the very beginning this is PURE Anderson. It never feels as something strange having chapter titles and stuff because we are used to that with Anderson; just think in his THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS for that. So it's always clear in the tone that this is a Wes Anderson film, and let's not forget that here we also have the Rolling Stones! One of my favorites: 'Street Fighting Man'! So with all of this one could think Roald Dahl's book share things with Anderson's bodywork. But now that I have read the book I know that this is also a lesson on how to make yours, in the best way possible, something previously released; this is film adaptation paradise, like I said. For instance, the book is for kids and none of Anderson's films are, not even this one. For the record, I borrowed my DVD of FANTASTIC MR. FOX to the seven or six-year-old nephew of my girlfriend, thinking he was going to enjoy it. He just said that it was 'weird'. And I really can't blame him. Actually, just put the word 'wonderfully' before 'weird' and you have exactly what this film is. Anderson not only added things to the history from the book -a very simple and ironic story about foxes being smarter than some horrible humans- but also gave to the characters, with those additions, similarities with his very own characters. If Mr. Fox is like a superhero that everybody admires in the book, here there's much more going on around him. I remember thinking during my very first viewing in Clooney's very own character from O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? while seeing the personality of Mr. Fox (then voice acting of Clooney is a real success), and I also recall the character Dignan from BOTTLE ROCKET thanks to him! And a character that doesn't appear in the book, Mr. Fox's son Ash (voiced by Jason 'Max Fischer himself' Schwartzman), is like the quintessential Wes Anderson character: a small fellow who suffers from being *different* (and who's jealous of his more athletic and attractive cousin Kristofferson – a complete new character as well). So I think, is what filmmakers must do when adapting a book or whatever: remain faithful to the main story but at the same time own the damn thing. Anderson's first adapted film is a true winner, and made of him a much richer filmmaker; it's simply pure 'melted gold'!",10,1,3,16 March 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," 'what kind of bird are YOU?' - my favorite film of the year so far
","I just completed my top 12 of the year for an online magazine I recently began collaborating with, and MOONRISE KINGDOM was my number 1. It's definitely THE film of the year so far, but I have yet to see some stuff with real potential; I'm talking of two films in specific: Tarantino's DJANGO UNCHAINED and Anderson's THE MASTER. Anyway, Wes Anderson's comeback from animation is his best since, well, that previous animated work FANTASTIC MR. FOX (2009). This means that it's yet another marvelous addition to his growing filmography – 7 feature films and right now each one of them could be a real treat for newcomers. Hell, the opening sequence of 'Moonrise', with the camera moving and showing each room of a house, can represent the essence of his filmmaking. 'Moonrise' certainly shares things with Anderson's past films; I actually had to revisit (for the first time ever) THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU after watching it. Had to since here we have some special effects, in pure Anderson fashion, that reminded me of 'Life Aquatic'. I'll use Owen Wilson's words on 'Life Aquatic' to really begin this commentary: 'It's an artificial world with real people' 'Moonrise' shares more with 'Life Aquatic' than with the rest of films from Anderson. Here too we have an artificial world with real, soulful characters. Anderson created a whole world for that 2004 film: islands, movies (and its posters) and even fish species. Here he created islands too, a whole map for his universe and even books (hell, the omnipresent narrator, played by Bob Balaban, looks like a Team Zissou member!). Imagine a kid who's told to draw a police station and simply draws a building, writes the words 'police station' and uses an arrow to point from the words to the drawing. This is the cinematic sort-of representation of that, if that makes sense. It has elements of an 'amazing, absurdist comedy' (to quote Guillermo del Toro, who called the BATMAN TV series from the sixties that), and the setting is definitely perfect for that. The main characters of MOONRISE KINGDOM are a couple of kids in love. Troubled souls unite, as that Pearl Jam song says, actually - it's a 'two against the world' sort-of thing where you care for the characters. The boy, Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) is arguably a classic Wes Anderson character – he's a little, and extremely clever, outcast. But there's a reason why he looks, at least for me, like a twelve-year-old Johnny Depp: he's a badass who's not afraid of girls, and who can deal with the bullies and single-handed make scouting a cool and impressive thing to do – I mean, in one of the best musical moments of the film we have Shakusky canoeing with the Hank Williams tune 'Kaw-Liga' as background music! This boy falls for a girl (played by Kara Hayward) who is, as well, a quintessential Anderson character – think in a teenage version of Margot Tenenbaum, who can't call *home* what he shares with her own family. What we have with the rest of the cast is what I would call absurdist gold. How absurd is that you hire two of the biggest Hollywood stars and make them play an incompetent island police and a Boy Scout leader? Here Bruce Willis is a cartoonish policeman and Edward Norton is the Boy Scout leader – it sounds funny, I know, and yes, it is to see, for instance, Norton being totally incapable of take care of his troop. And at the same time, this is probably Norton's best, deepest and most human role in years. The same goes for Willis – he has recently done stuff like COP OUT (Kevin Smith, 2010), and I believe none of his recent roles is as great as this one. 'Moonrise', by the way, marks the first time since PULP FICTION that Willis and Harvey Keitel share a film – Keitel has a minor role here and, surprise surprise, Anderson made him use Boy Scout clothes! I think two performers are here only to satisfy the Anderson fan. I actually watched this first at a press screening in Universal Pictures Mexico and later at a regular screening – not many people, I noticed, responded to Bill Murray's now typical attitude. But I loved every single second of Murray here – and I'm sure any Anderson fan will enjoy this sort-of reprise of his RUSHMORE part. And Jason Schwartzman, boy is he hilarious! So, and as any Wes Anderson, this won't turn everybody on; it gets crazy, absurd and fun, and at the same beautiful. Loved it! *Watched it on 07 and 12 November, 2012",10,2,5,16 December 2012
Flight," A serious piece about alcoholism, with some punk rock touches and a phenomenal lead performance
","Last Friday my girlfriend and I went to the movies and decided to watch two movies instead of the usual one; we didn't think much in our double-feature, I mean in the selection which certainly needs always to be featuring two similar films but not for the obvious reasons (like for instance just because both were directed by the same dude, as Tarantino once remarked), but we just based our selection in the show times: FLIGHT at 17:00 hrs. and THE IMPOSSIBLE at 19:30 hrs. We knew both were not feel-good experiences, but the similarities we found between them were more than we expected and luckily the double-feature was just damn right, with those magic movie moments – going out from a film that shows and is based upon an air crash to enter to one that begins with a sequence inside of a plane (not to mention that only a couple of a weeks ago I had enter a plane for the first time in years!). FLIGHT (Robert Zemecki's comeback from 'motion capture') and THE IMPOSSIBLE (Juan Antonio Bayona's first feature since 2007's EL ORFANATO) are about the consequences of, respectively, an air crash and a natural disaster. The structure in both is quite similar and none takes much time to show us the disaster (the big, important sequence we all know exists and therefore are waiting); in fact, both do it in a not very different way and at the moment of the impact (of both the plane with the surface and the tsunami) everything gets confused, the lose sound, certainly they are trying to put us in the victims' perspective. Both films bring us hard and sad issues during almost the whole time to end in an optimistic note (the characters that suffered find some light). 'Classic Hollywood style' you might be thinking, and yes, both are comforting for the average viewer (especially THE IMPOSSIBLE) but at the same time never forget that their subject is a tragic one – in FLIGHT the main character doesn't have the best ending (even if he finally finds some peace) and in THE IMPOSSIBLE the horror of the 2004 tsunami is always well exposed. The first sequence of FLIGHT, with the pilot 'Whip' Whitaker (Denzel Washington) waking up together with sexy flight attendant Katerina Marquez (Nadie Velazquez) after a night of sex, alcohol and drugs and just before a commercial flight, left no doubts we were seeing something not very common – this film takes no more than 10 minutes to end with the idea of security and professionalism we have or want to have of a pilot and a flight in general. With FLIGHT I recalled the good but overrated ARGO, not only because here too we have John Goodman in a little yet very important role but also for its tension. And personally, seeing Washington trying to save his plane from a crash turned out to be as tense, if not more, as seeing Affleck and the group of Americans trying to get out from Iran. Contrary to what happens in ARGO, here the big tension arrives soon; the central theme of FLIGHT is in fact a common issue that has been explored by cinema many times before: alcoholism. FLIGHT, I dare to say, is destined to become a referent of the subject and is definitely one of the best movie about addiction in recent memory. We also have a look at the world of heroin; yes, one more, and maybe what we get isn't something new but still Zemeckis is doing it right and, for example, gave us a perfect musical selection, in a scene that should have been longer: 'Under the Bridge', a song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers that's about the consequences of drug addiction, is used to illustrate the character Nicole (Kelly Reilly), a heroin addict. The soundtrack, by the way, is full of other iconic songs like 'Sympathy for the Devil' and 'Gimme Shelter' by the Rolling Stones (Marty Scorsese, anyone?) and 'What's Going On' by Marvin Gaye – not a surprise since Zemeckis did of the GUMP soundtrack a compilation of classics. The film puts together those characters (Washington and Reilly) and with this move we get to see the two extremes of an addiction case (besides the romantic side of the picture). With Reilly we have the case with hope, the addict with desires of moving on and remain sober (classic situations like the visit to help groups are featured). On the other hand, the pilot falls in the worst period of his life after the accident, drinking tons of alcohol (few cinema characters drink as much as 'Whip') and going through a constant fight (internal and external). Washington is absolute golden; his performance as an alcoholic can't get more believable, and he is too a 'bad motherf*****' at times. And precisely, that 'punk rock' touch ends being the extra of a very complete piece. The external fight of 'Whip', for instance, offer us an interesting enough argument for a good climax, even when we know it will be done with the classic 'audience at a jury'. The key here is the previous sequence to the one of the audience at the jury – one that's totally punk rock, that will surprise you and make you laugh with a John Goodman shining like in the good ol' THE BIG LEBOWSKI days, and a cool as hell Washington completing the circle and repeating the first sequence. Great stuff!*Watched it on 08 February, 2013",9,2,4,13 February 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," This film is like my 'Favourite Worst Nightmare'
","The friends Tina (Amanda Wyss) and Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) have a similar nightmare about a mysterious man who has 'finger Knives'. When Tina is mysteriously murdered, her boyfriend Rod (Nick Corri) is accused but there aren't concrete proves and Nancy begins to relate all to that man of her nightmares. Soon she will discover the truth about that man and will be in danger during her nightmares.Here's a terrific horror classic that introduces one of the greatest and most famous villains, not only in the horror genre but also in the entire Cinema history. Fred Krueger is his name and he is back to end with those who were saved. The plot is really good with suspense every minute and a terrific atmosphere. I love how this film use the sensation of a nightmare that we feel like it was real, a sensation that all of us have experience sometime, to create a great horror atmosphere. In this case is really terrifying for Nancy to awake with proves that her nightmares are real. But she is a very brave girl; I love how she, after realizing that nobody is going to help her, becomes an expert to can elaborate a really brilliant plan. In the end we have the beginning of an endless story that, until now, has about seven films and counting.Cast: all the young actors did a good job. Is funny to see Johnny Depp in his first film as Nancy's boyfriend. Robert Englund is the memorable Fred Krueger, definitely a terrific villain even with funny scenes. Remember the 'I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy'. Conclusion: It's a fact, right now we make fun of it, that my cousin doesn't want to sleep after watching this film when he was about 7 years old. Nowadays this film is not so impressive for young audiences because it doesn't have any gore but this is a perfect horror film that creates a terrific atmosphere full of suspense because of a magnificent villain that becomes more interesting and at the same time more terrifying when his past is reveal. Definitely 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is a film that you should watch at midnight to see if you can sleep after. I could so I think you will too.PS: I also recommend the parody/tribute of the Simpsons with Willie as Krueger; appears in the 'Treehouse of Horror VI'.",10,6,8,25 March 2008
50_50," Overlooked gem; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is golden
","I had been intending to watch 50/50 since some time ago. I ordered the Blu-Ray from ebay, however before it arrived to my place the film finally opened in Mexico City theaters. I ended watching it on the big screen with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago, the day after the 2012 Academy Awards, to be exact. I usually don't care much about the Oscars -and its many injustices- but this time I was thinking a lot in the Oscar-worthy material from 50/50, especially since it was the day after having a film like Alexander Payne's THE DESCENDANTS in many of the important categories. I think 50/50 and THE DESCENDANTS have many similarities with each other. For instance, they are two of the three 2011 films, that I have seen, with a character that suffers from Alzheimer's disease (the other being RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES). But aside of thematic similarities (there's the infidelity thing too, Hawaii is mentioned here and is the setting in the other, and of course the obvious one dealing with a character fighting for its life), they share what's most important: the great quality; especially the great quality of the main actor. If George Clooney's performance is, for many, overrated, then Joseph Gordon-Levitt's one is brutally overlooked for me. He is golden, portraying a young man (Adam) who has been diagnosed with a rare case of spinal cancer. Hell, I think I will remember more his performance than Clooney's. But anyway, 50/50 deals with the cancer disease in ways I don't think we have seen before. We have the required, and nevertheless touching, parts, too. Like for instance, we have the part when Gordon-Levitt's character sort of realizes what's really going on, so he breaks down, which is absolutely understandable; the situation is familiar and pretty much required in films of this matter, and at the same time those are the kind of scenes that allow Gordon- Levitt to fully show his potential. And boy oh boy, he is REALLY GREAT. It's a difficult film obviously, just as it makes you think in the terrible disease cancer is. Then for me this is also a rare case of a difficult picture that I can watch more than just one time. I mean, when a difficult/depressing film is great it is still difficult or depressing and you can't just easily watch it again like you would normally do with any other type of great film. Some people, like my girlfriend herself, will not want to revisit 50/50 even when they truly liked it. But I have seen it twice already and I plan to watch it again soon, now with my cousin since we both are huge fans of Seth Rogen and pals. Having the writers of SUPERBAD (Rogen and Evan Goldberg) as producers of a film about cancer is certainly a complete surprise. Rogen, by the way, is also playing Gordon-Levitt's co- worker and best friend (Kyle), and is like a comeback for him: he is basically reprising his funny-guy-pot-smoker role, from movies like KNOCKED UP. His 'reprise' is very much welcome, for my money.And it's not only the thing of making jokes around cancer. There are jokes and they are real fun, with Rogen on fire; and nobody, by the way, can really bitch about that since the writer himself -Will Reiser- had (or still has, I don't really know) cancer. But together with the jokes and stuff it's also the thing of creating an environment of pure camaraderie. Believe me, as well as Rogen both Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer are superb and key factors playing two cancer patients who will share, amongst some other things, Bob Marley's old favorite with Adam and, of course, Kyle! The feminine cast is also quite good; let's not forget that we have a sweet performance from Anna Kendrick (in the most predictable subplot of the story), the extremely beautiful Bryce Dallas Howard and, surprisingly, Angelica Houston; damn, they even 'got some' Pearl Jam (and some Bee Gees too)! You really have to check this one out. *Watched it on February 27 and March 03, 2012 (Blu-Ray).",10,0,1,14 March 2012
Get Him to the Greek," Yes, I laughed but it is mostly a disappointment the Russell Brand/Jonah Hill stuff from 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' was funnier
","It's been a while since I watched FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL (and a while since I don't write a IMDb comment). I recall watching it twice in less than four days it's, simply, a darn hilarious movie. A spin-off? Yes, here it is. I was really looking forward to watch GET HIM TO THE Greek, and a couple of days ago I ran across its R4 DVD (it was never released in theaters here in Mexico City). Well, I'm sure of two things: 1. Jonah Hill is gaining weight, as he is getting less and less funny (still he knows how to sing the Mars Volta!). 2. Russell Brand's Aldus Snow is a hilarious character that worked much better as a minor 'just for the fun' one. As I remember, their stuff in 'Sarah Marshall' delivered pretty much the greatest laughs of the movie (here Jonah Hill plays a completely different character tough). It was a simple situation: rock star dealing with a fan, (who is basically in love with him). Here we have a similar situation: same rock star dealing with a young man who works in the music business and who is also a huge fan. Laughs? Yes, we do have laughs, is pretty much inevitable having a guy like Brand (I would say 'like Hill' too but like I said, he is losing it and certainly a not- just-for-the-fun part, the exact we have here, doesn't fit him extremely well) but the movie never really feels like something fresh, like something worthy. It's a movie to see only once, that's for sure. 6.5 out of 10",6,1,4,11 December 2010
Pineapple Express," Holy c***! Holy hilarious movie! It's like God's vagina!
","Basically when I heard for the first time about this movie it became kind of part of the 'must wanted' movies for the rest of the year. I never knew when was going to be its theatrical release in my city that was finally last Friday (10 October 2008). I really wanted to watch for the first time a movie from the Apatow team on the big screen (I wanted to watch Step Brothers but now it's too late, it is not more in mi city) and yesterday I really enjoyed Pineapple Express, probably one of the funniest things from this year and definitely one of my personal favourites.Now I basically recognize all of the 'sons' of Apatow and immediately Bill Hader, one of them of course, provokes the first laughs. Hader is simply great; I don't really watch TV so I never had seen an entire Saturday Night Live episode so in consequence I only know Hader for his film roles but with that I can say I'm fan. In this film he doesn't share the screen with his cop partner from Superbad, Seth Rogen, however his character shares one little thing with Dale Denton, Rogen's character, and that of course has in marihuana the key factor. Now we move the present days with Dale, again Rogen seems to be playing the same role however that really doesn't bothered me at all mainly because once he is together with James Franco's character everything is fun with these two guys who are in their own thing and who really enjoy and love that thing. By reading some stuff about this film I realize about the fact that Rogen originally wanted to play my favourite character of the film, of course the character of Franco, Saul Silver, but they really scored by casting James Franco who is just hilarious as the charismatic stoner that Saul is. The first sequence with Dale and Saul together resumes everything, these two sees each other only for one thing but always we knew that there was some 'special', after all Saul gave only to Dale the vagina of god formerly known as pineapple express. They can make the other feel better, Saul could make that Dale felt better by reminded him of the beautiful girl he has and the awesome job that let him smoke many joints and Dale could make that Saul felt better just by reminded him that his job actually consists in selling drugs! But even with this they were only vendor and client and of course there will be one motive to make of these two a 'team', a 'team' that will need to fight for their lives. Pineapple Express turns to have many hilarious fights that seem to be really painful for the protagonists. Since our stoner heroes are being chased by a really powerful drug lord (played by Gary Cole) is obvious that some very dangerous and cold men will try to end with our heroes. And here we have another 'team' (played by Craig Robinson and Kevin Corrigan) that also have their moments of great fun. And where are the cops when our heroes and specially the persons close to them need them? Well, writing that one of the right hands of that powerful drug dealer is actually a policewoman (played by Perdita Durango (!) also known as Rosie Perez) is just enough to answer that question (f*** the police!!). But not all the cops are like that bitch and eventually our heroes will find another policewoman who really can help them but why they need her if the actions of hero Saul are enough? Well that is something that only Saul believed and eventually his hilarious actions (Saul breaking the windshield of the patrol!!!!) will make that our heroes will follow their own way to finally meet again to be buddies again and to survive to many explosions between a drug war in place full of drug!By the end we have a rally terrific and hilarious scene in which our three heroes (damn I didn't mention the hilarious character that Danny McBride plays. His name is Red, he is the connection between that powerful drug dealer and our hero Saul and he starts being a traitor, he just wanted to save his own ass no matter of the consequences however he ends being another damn hero who practically is like a cat with nine lives!) are talking, and laughing, about all the unbelievable things that happened during their crazy adventure. Is like a really hilarious resume of the movie, a movie that I would like to add to my collection. Probably my third favourite from the Apatow Team. 9.5 out of 10",Null,1,5,12 October 2008
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," MADAGASCAR 3 can be one of the highest-grossing films of the year but it's also a mess and the worst I have recently seen
","I remember going to the cinema with great expectation to see the brand-new Dreamworks project MADAGASCAR, back in June 2005. Boy was I disappointed; it was the kind of movie that makes think something like 'that's it?' when the credits begin to roll. Seven years later I didn't give a f*** when the third one (EUROPE'S MOST WANTED) was released. Nevertheless I ended watching it on the big screen (the 2D version) last Friday afternoon! I went to the cinema with my girlfriend and having seen already the great PROMETHEUS (we actually wanted to check out the new Woody Allen film, TO ROME WITH LOVE, but sadly its release was postponed or something) there wasn't really anything else that we wanted to see. We ended choosing this one, over the new Tim Burton picture (I'm still not sure if I want or not to watch this), mainly because my girlfriend actually liked the second MADAGASCAR (which I haven't seen). But in the end we both agree the third one is plain bad. I actually liked the first minutes of it. Thought it was really cool the made-with-sand model of New York City and the reference to KING KONG. Yes, that's pretty much what I liked of this film. It's hard to believe that one of its writers also co-wrote (together with the mighty Wes Anderson) the masterpiece FANTASTIC MR. FOX. I mean, both films are quite the opposite, with this one being like a collection of random material. MADAGASCAR 3 is painfully random, to tell the truth. They throw at you lots of stuff that is just not really funny or spectacular (as they intended), like a lemur and a bear getting married in Rome (what is it with this traveling around the world kind of thing in animated films? I mean, I recently re-watched last year's CARS 2 and just like in this one the characters travel to Italy and England!), and frankly at one point I was like 'calm down!' – it's only in the middle of the movie or so when you finally get some story to follow (about a familiar subject in kids movies: friendship). Also, I found those new characters to be really annoying; take for instance the case of the antagonist, who is voiced by Frances McDormand. In the hands of other writers this character could have been a whole lot of fun (a bad to the bone animal control hunter who is trying to make the lion one of her trophies); they think this character is fun, but it's just so crazy it gets ridiculous. Anyway, the kids at the cinema even applauded when it was over. So yes, they seem to love it but I don't, at all. *Watched it on 22 June, 2012",2,8,19,24 June 2012
True Romance," Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancun
","'let's re-watch True Romance'...that's how I ended my IMDb comment of Quentin Tarantino's first, if never officially released and incomplete, film My Best Friend's Birthday. I remember finding True Romance on R4 DVD about two years ago under the title of 'La Fuga', that means something like 'The Escape'(I remember being surprised after finding the R4 DVD, being like 'damn, how I was going to find it! That's why we don't f****** learn English!'), and I saw it immediately. After seeing, finally, My Best Friend's Birthday (the basis of the script of True Romance) I had desires to watch for the second time this film (pretty much back in 2007 I liked it but not really as much as any other film that I would like to watch more than once) and I finally did so last night. I think I liked it a bit more than the first time. Christian Slater is Tarantino, I mean he is Clarence and he has the same name and some same dialogs of Tarantino's character in 'Birthday' yet here Clarence is the one of the birthday (and his last name ain't Pool), then the one who is going to receive something that tastes like a peach from his best friend, or better said from his boss since apparently he has no friends. Clarence is a guy who will f*** all of his possibilities to make out with a nice chick by inviting her to a Kung Fu night at the cinema ('you wanna take me to a Kung Fu movie?', asks the probable date of our hero and he f****** gains us more yet and certainly not her once he responds to her question, he goes like: 'three Kung Fu movies'), and who will be in his birthday, just like every year, having a good time at the cinema (fortunately the DVD of The Street Fighter is there on my shelf just waiting!) but then it happens, a dream comes true, it's paid but nevertheless it's a dream come true! Patricia Arquette for your birthday! And the dream goes on and on: true romance, wedding, love tattoo, Elvis but also lots of violence, the clerk of a comic book store is now a pimp f***** (you gotta love Gary Oldman in this one!), what love makes...Anyway, for me with True Romance we don't have a film that has some parts that really stands out as the better ones. Is not like once they, Clarence and his wife, Patricia Arquette's character, Alabama, arrive to Los Angeles (that is like the second part of the film) the film is better or worse. Is more like, we have good and not so good moments during the whole film. Some of the performances are not quite convincing and some scenes should have been better (for instance the final confrontation between practically everybody at a hotel room could have been much more exciting and tense). Going back to the performances, well as you know we have a cast full of stars: from Dennis Hooper to Brad Pitt passing through Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Walken (and for the TV fans we have Tony Soprano, as a mafioso that will make us see another side of the peach Alabama, and Berta from Two and a Half Men. Oh and for us The Wire fans there's Paul Ben-Victor, aka: Spiros Vondas, also as a mafioso). Seeing the film in 2009 is of course seeing a film full of real Hollywood stars yet is not seeing a film full of truly great acting. All of them are okay and most of them have at least a memorable bit. Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper stands out for the part in which we confirm two things and both Brad Pitt (minor role but very funny and quite relevant even though he never goes out of his place) and Gary Oldman delivers a lot of fun... the rest, well like I said they all are okay (it's nice having Elvis, by the way).And just like its performances for me True Romance is not a truly brilliant masterpiece (or a film I would like to watch again and again) but a fun ride nevertheless.",10,1,2,21 September 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Wish You Were Here
","Sunday of Oscars means Friday of Oscar-nominated films coming finally to the theaters here in Mexico City certainly. Actually this last week has the first day of the FICCO (Festival International de Cine Contemporaneo de la Ciudad de Mexico), certainly a chance to see very interesting films (The Wrestler, Maradona by Kusturica (which I'm going to see this same night, for free, at the Zocalo for the first time on the big screen since I already saw it a couple of times on DVD), Waltz with Bashir, Bob Marley: Exodus 77, The Good, the Bad, the Weird are some of those that I don't want to miss), certainly I'm glad it began and it began precisely with a film that the Academy nominated for Best Picture, it began with Milk. And I missed the chance to see Milk on the big screen before the 'big night' (it will be released during the first days of March). Yesterday I had planned to see my first film of the FICCO yet Slumdog Millionaire came finally yesterday to Mexico City so is very very probable that tomorrow I will be watching the Oscars after seeing only two of the five pictures that are 'fighting' for the big prize of the night (Benjamin Button being the other) yet after seeing what for most is going to be the winner of the night, certainly this one that was my fifth encounter with a Danny Boyle film and if not a perfect one sure it is a great film. Is a surprise to see a normal boy enduring a torture by some police men, certainly they want that the boy, who is our main character and who is played by Dev Patel, Tanay Chheda and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Jamal Malik talk but they will end saying something like 'he's a tough guy'. So we go back to see that certainly Jamal during his childhood had no other chance but to fight for his life. This is absolutely my favourite part, when Ayush Mahesh Khedekar and Tanay Chheda are Jamal, the City of God. Realistic, we have who is apparently nothing but a hero, he sees street children and he comes with a tasty Coca-Cola for the heat, for them he must be good since he allow them to eat a little more, these are just children, many but certainly we known Jamal, Jamal's elder brother Salim (played by Madhur Mitta, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) and Latika (played by Freida Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali). Very early in the picture we see that of the two brothers one is more of a Zé Pequeno and the other is more of a Buscapé, and we see moments of happiness yet very tragic moments that become more tragic for the boys because they can't do anything, they are just there trying to get by day by day so when that mentioned hero comes their life has a little light, they don't have to worry for food, they have their minds in other stuff that is different from the stuff that is in the mind of the hero. So we now very well since the beginning both Jamal and Salim, we know that if it depend only on him Salim would have never return to Mumbai, after all they found something completely different, something more like the heaven of their heads, I guess seeing the Taj Mahal is more than impressive. But also we know that Jamal's heart is only for one girl, this is a love story, a magical one, why Jamal was that tough? We have realistic answers, a realistic background, powerful part. Why Jamal knew all the answers when he was on the Indian TV show 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' if he never had a formal education, if he was just a slumdog? He certainly not cheated, for the police men was not too complicated to find that after Jamal talked about those moments of his past that came to his mind that night when he was on the TV show. Here the point, the most 'love moment': when Jamal, during the second night on 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?', is only one question away of the 20 million rupees he uses one of those lifelines, he doesn't know the answer, we know that when he says that on TV he is not lying, he marks the only telephone number he knows, his brother's, yet we know where is that cell phone, time to a dramatic little moment before he hear her voice, now the answer is not important, even if so she can't give it but he after all came to that show not for the money. So let's dance, why? it is writtenin the script.",9,0,2,21 February 2009
Donnie Darko," You can't just forget a film like Donnie Darko and that's a compliment
","Donnie Darko is one of those films that you can't easily forget; i saw it last week and i'm still thinking in the story and truly is one of the best films that i have seen in this year. I know that this film was release in 2001 and that i saw it 6 years later but here in Mexico it wasn't release in the theaters and like in the rest of the world this film gain popularity in the DVD format and right now is a true cult film.It's hard to write a resume of the plot but i must say that is film is just unique because is not just a sci-fi story, is also a critic to the establish society and a view to the teenage life.Let's forget for a moment the time travel part and focus into the points of view of Donnie Darko. He is very clever, shy and very different from the rest of his school partners. Whe he start having this strange views of the rabbit (i really love those scenes) he start doing things that he always want to do but (like most of the persons) he was afraid. I mean, he wants to 'change things' and in resume, he was against the establish society. Like in the school when he was against the idea of his teacher that in life there were just two things: love and fear, Donnie says that life wasn't that easy and simple but the teacher was afraid to go out the 'normal' points of view of the school.So i really love a lot of things like that one in the entire film apart from the time travel story which also, i think is great. Like the talk between Donnie and the 'f****** Antichrist', is really good and an example of the people which Donnie was against.About the sci-fi story: the time travel story is not easy to forget and is not easy to resume.I have only watch his film one time and other time very quickly so maybe i'm not correct but that's the magic of this film, is a very interesting story that makes you think.SPOILER ALERT!!!! (just for the people who already watch the film) For me is was like everything really happened, no matter if Donnie could travel back in time. I mean when Donnie dies, everybody wakes up from like a dream but they are thinking in what they lived with Donnie: Frank touches his eye and the 'Antichrist' is crying for example. And also in the final scene there is a recognition between Gretchen (Donnie's girl) and Donnie's mother, so is like a story that ends on October 28 when the plain travel back on time to October 2 and in the case of the film we see that Donnie stays in his bed. Other thing is the character of Roberta Sparrow (Grandma Death) that is always checking the mail box because i think she knows that in some part of the story she will receive a letter that i think before she have already seen.Well is a very interesting story that you can comment with your friends and that makes you see this film more than 1 time.SPOILER ENDS!!!!!About the cast: is just great with a young Jake Gyllenhaall making his best performance (along with his character in 'Zodiac') and with Drew Barrymore in a little role, i think she read the script and love it and said like 'i give you the money but you give a role'. And the rest of the cast is excellent.The visual part of the film is nothing but a piece of art and the music is more than excellent, with the beautiful 'Mad World' and also with 'Love will tear us apart' by Joy Division.As a conclusion: Donnie Darko is just a work of art and now is a must see; and for me is one of my favourites films of this decade. 10 out of 10DVD: is just great because that is the unique format that this film was release in Mexico. I have the 'regular' edition with only 1 disc but is great with a lot of bonus material so i really like it.",10,18,30,26 November 2007
Back to the Future," Maybe someday your name will be in lights saying 'Marty McFly tonight'
","Before yesterday, 03 July 2008, I haven't seen this Robert Zemeckis picture since long time ago, I think actually since I was a kid, when this was one of the regular pictures showed on National TV together with the part II and the part III. I think saw the Back to the Future trilogy at least two or three times yet right now I don't remember a lot of things from part II and III just like before yesterday of part I. So right now I'm glad I saw this one after so many years; Back to the Future is the quintessential movie entertainment with two memorable characters, one memorable car and, of course, a magnificent time travel story full of fun and romance but not in a near or far future but in 1955. Well in the film is 1985 and Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is in high school, loves to play guitar with his band, is ready to spend more time with his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) and the scientist and inventor Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is his friend. Here we also meet Marty's parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson), and also the abusive boss of George, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson). But is the Doc the one who is going to change everything for Marty with his latest invention that could be his own masterpiece: a De Lorean that works as a time machine.I really like how in this picture the time travel stuff was used in a simple but great way. You can travel to any time but not to any place and of course, once in the past, anything you do will have consequences. The picture plays again in a simple way to focus just in the story of Marty's parents in 1955, in high school. Since everybody that Marty knows seems to be just as they are in 1985 (except his mother) his problem with the time machine is in good hands with a young Doc that looks exactly as in 1985 (funny). So the issue is just to get together George and Lorraine but that is going to be a -funny- problem since Marty has already replace his father and now he is the object of love of his own mother!Many funny details with Marty Calvin Klein Darth Vader McFly and even what could be just a pretext to use one of the greatest songs in rock and roll history (if that was the case is still good since the song is Johnny B. Goode) turns to be just a great, memorable and hilarious scene with the cousin of Chuck. And in the end everything was just right on time for Marty and Doc, even way better, and leaves everything for more pictures.Cast: Both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are terrific; in the case of J. Fox this is the role for what I know him and eventually the one for what I always recognize him. Almost the same for Lloyd but he was also in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Robert Zemeckis, 1988) and in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Milos Forman, 1975). Crispin Glover is also terrific as a really weird but eventually lucky character.Conclusion: Back to the Future is just a classic family entertainment with a magnificent story. That said, what else I could add to my -obvious- conclusion? I think just this: 9.5 out of 10",10,1,3,4 July 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Back to the old days of the show, the great days
","In Mexico City and i imagine that in all the world there were a lot of crazy rumors about this film, but the main and biggest rumor was that the people of Fox feel that the film was bad so they were afraid to release the film the same day that the film Transformers was going to be release. In part was true because the film doesn't opens on July 27, the films opens until the next Wednesday i mean Agust 1. I was afraid that the other part of the rumor was true but the film is juts as the old days of the show: Great.I mean, the Simpsons had a golden age that for me was from the season 1 until the season 8 or 9, later there was funny episodes and great moments but not as good as the first 9 years. That is amazing because to keep a show with quality in 9 or 10 years (and in this case a cartoon) is really unique and incredible. The Simpsons became just a classic show that in Mexico has amazing audience that kept this show in the top since 1993 or 1994.So the film is like the good age of the show, like it was release like 10 years ago because is just fun the entire film, with Homer in his best moments whit spider pig, a really fun pig (but what happened whit spider pig?) And whit strange things that in the show never happens or not usually, like Lisa finding her soul mate or Bart drunk and loving Ned Flanders.So finally this film is great and like the good days of the show, you can see it thousands of times and you never get bored",10,0,2,24 September 2007
The Fighter," 'make me wanna holler the way they do my life'
","Right now, everybody knows what's the deal with The Fighter. Everybody knows about the performance of Christian Bale. Everybody knows that he is the one who steals the film. Hell, everybody knows that he will win the Oscar for best supporting actor in a couple of weeks. He is fantastic indeed, and I will just add that for me was really remarkable how Bale gains you when the runtime of the movie doesn't even marks 10 seconds. It's great, I was like 'well everybody was right, Bale is doing something truly remarkable here'. I just loved his performance. And that clip during the closing credits showing the real-life Dicky Ward (Bale's character. He is the older brother of the main character) sort of gives *even* more value to Bale's performance as you can see that he really got Dicky. I saw this one a week ago, a week after I saw for the very first time The Basketball Diaries (1995). Two movies that might be nice companion pieces as they deal with the same subjects: sports, drug addiction and family. And Mark 'Marky Mark' Wahlberg is in both. The Basketball Diaries goes as the one that presents the 'downfall' kind of story and here we have a movie about the rise to success. Here the main character, Wahlberg's Micky Ward (yes, Bale steals the movie but not by much as Wahlberg is AMAZING too, making of Micky a truly great and hugely likable main character. Definitely one of the high-points of his acting career), grows in every way during the course of the picture. The problems come from the outside, well, from his very own family to be exact. There we have the 'downfall' story with Dicky, once a local hero of boxing but now the subject of an HBO documentary about crack cocaine addiction. So there we have the drug addiction thing, the family issues. The Fighter is, as some other IMDb users have said, a crowd-pleasing picture. It's really well constructed, having characters like the ones of Melissa Leo and Amy Adams (the mother and girlfriend of Micky) that really help in order to create the kind of perfect crowd-pleasing picture: with characters you really care for and powerful moments full of emotion moments like when the little known song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, 'Strip My Mind' (I was like 'I know this song'! it was a really pleasant surprise to hear it here. Also, loved that the soundtrack features classic rock tunes like Led Zeppelin's 'Good Times Bad Times' and the Rolling Stones' 'Can't You Hear Me Knocking'!), appears (when is like the new beginning for our main character) are the ones that due to the great emotion presented really got me. I'm getting really corny but, thankfully, the movie never does that. Great stuff.",10,3,4,16 February 2011
The Godfather," The Godfather is my favourite film of all time
","A family, the Don, everyone knows him, everyone knows of his power, here is the end of his era and simply the beginning of another, we a fantastic look into a family, into a style of life. It begins and we see who Vito Corleone is, we see another man who shares some things with Vito, both are Italians now established in America, that other man believes in the country that gave him and his family a fine life certainly, here you see what the Corleone family can do. And is a wonderful contrast, is the life the Corleone family, Vito ordered for justice and next he is dancing with his daughter. Family and the business, so in the business part we meet Sollozzo, big nose Italian, great businessman, narcotics are the future and Sollozzo knows that to get to that bright future Vito is important. And all is simply because of don't keeping you very own thoughts with you, every one knew that narcotics means dollars, Vito's son and right hand Tom Hagen, Vito's eldest son Santino but the decision was only of Vito. Then this is a terrific story, logic and business, 'nothing personal', here Michael Corleone will enter, not to the film certainly but to the business. As any other character Michael is really interesting, here we know that he is a war hero, he is not like his family but certainly he knows the world of his family, he was born in that world. Basically during the very first part of the film we see Michael as a normal man with his former girlfriend Kay, buying Christmas presents, going to the cinema, having dinner and stuff. Soon we will see him in Sicily but before we see his first contact with the business part, obviously he suffered like Santino or Tom when he saw on the newspaper that Vito Corleone was shoot and that was still unknown if he was dead or alive so basically is this what puts Michael closer to the business part. So this is the very beginning of a new era but we don't know that yet, after all Michael was going to have a meet with Sollozzo and his dirty police officer because he was a civilian, not related with the family business. Is a great scene, the very best of Pacino in this film so Sollozo and his dirty police officer are dead, a new 'chapter' in The Godfather begins, another engaging part of the film, for me each second of The Godfather is wonderful. So we for the first time see Sicily, there Michael is just waiting, there he meets a beautiful girl, she becomes his wife, certainly there are news from New York, Santino was killed (an emblematic scene), the future of Michael is only one. The last time we see Vito as the Don we see him together with Tattaglia, Barzini, Cuneo and Stracci, after this Vito realizes about something and that will save Michael's life. He is still the Don for the men of the Corleone family but certainly if they trust in Vito and are loyal to Vito they must trust in Michael and be loyal to Michael who at the time was already father, Anthony the name of his son, together with Anthony Vito is laughing, enjoying a normal time with his grandson, the most unexpected death thinking in Don Vito Corleone after the life he had, he always had honor, love for his family, he died in a peaceful way, playing with his grandson, in his house, if that would have been an offer certainly would have an offer he can't refuse. The cast is simply perfect, the voice of Brando, the strange charisma of James Caan as Santino, one of Pacino's best performances, simply each actor/actress is fantastic giving life to all those memorable characters. My very first experience with The Godfather was not a really long time ago, was in 2005 and I came to them together with some members of my family who like me had never seen by then any of the three films, I loved The Godfather and in 2006 I read the novel by Mario Puzo. I remember not having clear in my mind each detail of the film when I started reading the novel, by then I had seen only once The Godfather. I loved the novel and after reading it I went to another one by Puzo, The Last Don and I loved it also. So after this I remember having this sort of Mafia summer by watching first the miniseries based on The Last Don and later watching again The Godfather trilogy. This film has become the one I love the most, its long runtime feels like nothing, I watched it a lot of times back in 2006 once I had read the novel, fantastic. I received for Christmas the Coppola Restoration four-disc set on Blu-ray, while I haven't seen yet Part II and III (and the new bonus material) on Blu-ray this part looks so beautiful, in short you remember how it looks the blood of Moe Greene (during that memorable baptism sequence)? Well on Blu-ray it finally looks like blood!PD: my very first IMDb comment was precisely for The Godfather. While I'm not at all ashamed or anything like that about it I don't like it either so I decided to delete it and write another one. I was going to put it here just because it was my very first comment but thanks to the words limit I can't. I will put it on my message board profile.",10,7,12,26 December 2008
