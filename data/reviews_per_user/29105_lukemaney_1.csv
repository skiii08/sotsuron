Hereditary," This generations 'The Shining'
","I felt that this movie was extremely good. The acting, especially that of Toni Collette, is absolutely amazing. Very similar to the shining, the movie builds up to something that only happens at the end. And much like the shining, the ending leaves you with a lot of questions. However, this is what makes movies like Hereditary and The Shining great. It leaves you to interpret the true meaning. It makes you want to come back and rewatch so that you can try and analyze deeper.",10,12,23,13 June 2018
