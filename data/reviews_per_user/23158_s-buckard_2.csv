Ford v Ferrari," Best movie of 2019
","It's hard for me to give movies a 10 out of 10, but this movie has to be the best movie of 2019. From the second this movie starts youll be sucked into the story and youll feel every emotion from the actors. Just amazing!",10,2,3,26 November 2019
Dunkirk," Is the IMDb rating ''8.2'' manipulated?
","First of all this is one of the most disappointing movies of 2017, I really do not understand why this movie has an IMDb rating of 8.1, also because almost all comments are rating below 3. Second of all the story of this movie and the way they shown it is truly terrible.Back to the IMDb rating 8.1, is this movie really comparable with movies like: Hacksaw Ridge, 12 years a slave, Into the Wild, Shutter Island, No Country for Old men??? Just NO WAY.",4,1,1,21 December 2017
