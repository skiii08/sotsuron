Skyfall," Worst Bond Movie Ever!!!
","I am very much a Bond Movie fan and have always enjoyed the excitement, imagination and innovation that typically goes hand in hand with all the Bond movies.I entered the movie theatre full of positive expectation that Skyfall would be another James Bond classic. Sadly what I saw was nothing of the sort.The movie lacked a credible storyline, in fact the storyline was so weak and fundamentally flawed that it became annoying. The usual James Bond techno-innovation, which has always been the hallmark of the 007 brand, was completely absent. In fact the absence of anything even resembling some 21 century innovation, gave a clear impression that this was a 'low-budget' movie. Then there were the characters. James Bond, or should I say Daniel Craig looked terrible. For much of the movie he looked tired and haggard. Not a look that is synonymous with 007. Judy Dench likewise looked her age and came across as frail and weak and certainly didn't present the image you would associate with the head of MI6.Historically I have watched James Bond movies many times over. Sadly this one I will NEVER watch again.Bottom line, this was very very disappointing.",2,6,14,7 January 2013
