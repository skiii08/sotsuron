The New World," Gorgeous
","The New World is undoubtedly the most gorgeous film I have ever seen! Stunning scenery, a brilliant score by James Horner, incredible performances by all involved, not least of all Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas. She has extremely expressive features, which never fail to draw out the emotions of her audience. Every frame of this movie is absolutely breathtaking and I doubt that I'll ever tire of any moment of this film. I love how eloquently Terrence Malick tells the story of John Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe. When our characters are happy and free, we are happy and free, when they are tortured, we are tortured, and we have enough perspective on each character to avoid being judgmental. I can't get the scene out of my mind with John and Pocahontas standing on opposite sides of the fire outside of the fort as Pocahontas pleads with John to 'come away.' This movie tears me apart piece by piece before it fills me to the point of bursting! By far my favorite movie.",10,1,4,31 July 2006
