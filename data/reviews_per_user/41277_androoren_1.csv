Minority Report," Good, solid entertainment
","Some of the characters are stereotypes, Spielberg does insist on ramming information down our throats and there is a fair bit of clunky exposition.But this is still a good film.And yes, there are some plot holes, but a lot of those pointed out in these comments are just people not understanding the film. You can't blame Spielberg for your own stupidity. Although you can blame him for his dumb sappy ending with the ridiculous 'and we all lived happily ever after' voice-over.I'd recommend it, go see it.",8,0,0,25 July 2002
