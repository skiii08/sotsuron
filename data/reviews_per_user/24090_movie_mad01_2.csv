Mission: Impossible III," a movie worthy of its title
","Tom Cruse returns to the never boring world of mission impossible. Given the success of the other mission impossible movies you would never expect this one to over come the bar, but surprisingly it dose. I'm not the biggest Tom Cruse fan but this movie is a splendid mix of action, romance and puzzles, with twists at ever corner. Ethan Hunt has being assigned to retrieve a captured agent, strait after the mission, lies and secrets start to unfold, making Ethan having, to once again, save the world. Also for all you 'Lost' fans, look out for the lost secret somewhere in the movie. I won't give it away, but look carefully. Mission impossible 3 is a thrilling movie that is worth seeing. If you liked the other Mission Impossible movies or just looking for a good time that will leave your heart pumping then this movie is for you!",8,2,4,20 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," and a bottle of rum
","Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie worth the wait. It was funny as hell and once again Johnny Depp was magnificent in it. I am a big fan of this movie and advise every one o go see it. Although it dose have a twist in the end that will leads in to the 3rd movie it is full of action, drama and comedy. Really its just the ending that brings it down. look out for hidden secrets that will help with the 3rd movie. Bravo to the movie people you haven't let us down but PLEASE hurry up with the 3rd. And remember to watch the end of the credits, because there is an exclusive clip in the end. So in consolation if you like the first movie then ship off and see this one, and if you didn't well then don't see this movie. may there be rum on the ship and wind in your sails.",8,0,2,6 July 2006
