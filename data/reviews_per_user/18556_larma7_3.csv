The Blair Witch Project," Perhaps flawed, but still a masterpiece in horror and great filmmaking
","Think of a time where you are sitting alone in the late hours of the night, preferably in an old house. You sit there quietly in the silent darkness before you start to hear unexplained creeks around the house, rustling of the tress in the wind outside, and all of a sudden, without any reason whatsoever, the tension inside you starts to build up, your mind at times causing your imagination to run wild. There is indeed a distinct level of creepiness that can occur being isolated in the quiet hours of night, and this is even amplified when outside, something which the characters of the ground-breaking horror film 'The Blair Witch Project' have to face. And you face this creepiness, among other forms of terror, with them as you experience the film. Much has been made about the controversy of how people were literally duped into believing that these tapes were real footage, partially because the filmmakers apparently advertised it as being 'real.' It's also fairly understandable (although obviously unlikely under a critical light) to have possibly believed this because the production, despite the minuscule budget, is quite remarkable in how believable and convincing it is. Sure, the characters can be a bit obnoxious and heavy-handed at times, but the performances are very good. However, the main reason that the film works is that it takes a bit of an unconventional and refreshing approach in its attempt to scare its audience. 'The Blair Witch Project' doesn't merely work on just realism to achieve its horror -- it is, in fact, most impressive in how it utilizes its setting to ultimate effect to create a subtly overbearing atmosphere that just continues to creep into the film.Part of the setting's effectiveness is that I deeply identify with the actual setting. Living in the United States and on the Pennsylvania/Maryland boundary line, I am extremely familiar with the type of woods the characters traverse. In fact, anyone who has lived in rural, forrest areas or who perhaps has experienced camping in the woods can probably relate. Additionally, I love films set in the wilderness, especially ones which heavily emphasize their environment in order to tell the story. This film is a perfect example. The cold and desolate nature of the forests help supplement the feeling of dread within the film. People have criticized this film as boring and that nothing happens. Ironically, a lot of the intrigue I find in the film is when supposedly nothing (visually) is happening. Visually, the film at times reaches the level of being entrancing. The endless shots staring into the woods -- staring into the darkness. What is heard, but what isn't seen. The silences. Yes, according to traditional narrative standards, barring a few encounters and events along the way, little to nothing (on the surface) actually happens. It's a film which works in tremendous restraint in showing very little, and instead allowing the audiences' own imagination to do the scaring. It's not horror that works on gore or masked murderers. It doesn't even work on being afraid of ghosts or monsters or the supernatural. It's the tremendous feeling of isolation and vulnerability in the cold, desolate forest. The feeling of being alone and lost and stalked. Consequently, because of the pseudo-documentary technique of telling the story (which some dismiss as being merely a gimmick), the film actually invites us to become more involved in the setting and immersed in the characters' immense frustration, panic, and terror in being lost, starving, and hunted. Not only is this despair felt psychologically within the conflict between the characters, but we also can share the characters' experiences just as they are. The film works on an interesting dynamic of putting the viewer as a central observer of the action, due to the filmmaking technique being used. Whenever the camera stares off into the distance, we stare with it. Whenever the characters become silent in order to listen, we listen with them. A brilliant sequence deep into the film has the characters stumble across these bizarre stick figures hanging from trees. On its own the images are quite eerie in the way they are photographed, but what makes the scene most disturbing is the characters' reaction to these stick figures. There isn't anything too inherently scary or disturbing about this scene if witnessed on its own. However, at this point of the film, the characters' and audience has already witnessed some creepy occurrences, and as an audience member you can connect with the feeling that the characters have of being lost and completely disoriented. So, furthermore, when the already growing insane characters' freak out over these relatively harmless stick figures, this allows the opportunity for the audience to become freaked out. After-all, sometimes there is nothing more unsettling then seeing other people freaked out. Here, the characters and audience feed off each other and experience things together. This is the ultimate goal of filmmaking, and it is achieved here so simply but at the same time so brilliantly. The scares are not created artificially, but come with context, and they are slowly built up through the setting, the atmosphere it creates, and the tension and emotions of the characters. The end result is at times intensely disturbing, exhausting, and mostly quite convincing.",9,0,4,10 July 2011
Kagemusha," A big, beautiful bore
","This one is known by many to be a 'warm-up' to 'Ran'. Perhaps that should have been a warning, as I wasn't a huge fan of that film. But still, I remained interested in this one and it looked good. But lordy did I find this one a big, beautiful, empty bore. I mean, sure, the visuals are crazy good at times, lovely colors, and it is just in general a great looking movie. Excellent design and all. But at the same time I sort of feel that's all that was to it.The performances here aren't nearly as stilted or obnoxious as some in 'Ran', and in fact I really like Tatsuya Nakadai in this. The problem here is that I don't think anyone involved was given much interesting material to work with. It isn't that I don't think there is an interesting story to be told here, but I sort of see this movie as a missed opportunity. Instead of focusing more on developing the character of the impersonator, too much time is spent on scenes of rival sides scheming and questioning if Shingen is alive or dead. Things seem to only be addressed on the surface and the character interactions are never given enough time to breath. More importantly, this might not be as much of a problem if the film didn't move at such an excruciating pace. Some films are deliberately paced a certain way and some films are slow-burning, but this one just feels slow, period, and without much of a purpose most of the time.Additionally, I often found that scenes and drama were laboriously set-up within the story, then those scenes slowly unfolded, and then there is little actual pay-off. Take for instance the section of the story where the one Clan leader decides to send a priest carrying medicine as a supposed 'gift' to Shingen, but really they want to find out if Shingen is actually alive or not. This is thoroughly explained by the Clan leader. Then when the priest arrives, Shingen (or the impersonator) and his fellow leaders discuss how they KNOW what the other Clan leader is up to, and how they must hide it! Then when the scene actually HAPPENS there ends up being little to no tension and nothing actually comes of it. It's just completely frustrating to watch! Scenes go on forever and sometimes the film just feels dead. All of a sudden then we'll cut to a scene of rousing music as men on horse-back prepare for battle. It felt like it all had no real flow at all. Even the battle scenes were really disappointing -- the ones at night were very hard to follow.I will admit that the movie can be a stunner at times. That ending is really something, but even then it feels like the film is shouting 'LOOK HOW EPIC AND TRAGIC I AM!!!!' Sort of like 'Ran', really. But in retrospect, this film makes me appreciate 'Ran' even more, for where that movie sort of falls apart for me in its later stages, at least it had a little umpf to it. 'Kagemusha' feels like it never actually gets off the ground. Kurosawa is a great filmmaker, but I can't get behind this one.",4,16,26,11 August 2011
Up in the Air," 'Up in the Air' -- a great, and sometimes brutal, film!
","Director Jason Reitman's new film 'Up in the Air' is a favorite for Oscars, and it is great film.It stars George Clooney as Ryan Bingham, who works for a business firm where he is sent around the country to fire people from their jobs. His job is his life. He spends almost all the days of the year constantly travelling by plane. He has become so comfortable with traveling that he hates to be home at his apartment. His real home is up in the air in an airplane.Bingham's job certainly is not for the faint of heart. He sits face to face with people he has never met and tells them that they no longer have a job. Bingham's job is not to provide sympathy for the person, but to provide some kind of hope so their process of leaving the company goes smoothly. Bingham is a master at his art, staying calm and smooth even when the people he is firing become hostile.However, Bingham's own job becomes at stake when a young, vibrant Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a recent Cornell graduate, starts at the firm and introduces a new technology which would enable people like Bingham to fire people over the computer, making the already brutal job more impersonal but also more cost efficient. This now threaten's Bingham's life-style of travelling the country almost every day of the year. The thought of living at home makes him sick and uneasy. But before this new system is put into place, Bingham is forced to travel with Keener across the country, showing her the ropes of how to fire people.It is a very funny, although also at times a very brutal film. Filled with cruel irony -- some funny, some sad. Reitman's film works not only as a character study, but also as a satire of America's poor economic state.But the success of the film really does rely on George Clooney's wonderful, vulnerable performance playing the lonely, empty character of Bingham. Bingham discovers how truly empty and devoid of value his life really is. His job requires him to be emotionally cold, and with his constant travel and lack of any real relationships, his life is now emotionally cold and empty as well.Along the way, Bingham also develops a relationship with a middle-aged, frequently travelling business woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga), both sharing the life of constant travel away from home. With Alex, Bingham finally starts to open up emotionally, as he seeks some kind of relationship that his life has been lacking.Ultimately, 'Up in the Air' is about finding value and strength through the relationships we form with people. It is a brutal world out there, and we need people with us to get through it sometimes.Furthermore, I truly am a fan of Reitman now. 'Thank You For Smoking' was a fantastic, hilarious satire and 'Juno' was a very fun, sweet coming of age film. Neither quite reached greatness, but I think now with 'Up in the Air' Reitman has made his first truly great film.Now is this quite a masterpiece? No, not quite. I did have some problems with the ending and there were a few moments that I completely predicted near the end. In addition, some moments felt a little clichéd. However, overall this is a great film and should not be missed. It is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.",9,1,6,1 January 2010
