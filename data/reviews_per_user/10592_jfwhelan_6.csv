50 First Dates," I Enjoyed it.
","This is quite simply a very enjoyable film. It's not, perhaps, a great film, but it is fun and it left me feeling pleasantly content. Basically this is a romantic comedy about a man (Henry) and a woman (Lucy) who meet and fall in love, there is just one problem: Lucy won't remember, tomorrow.It is easy to pick holes in films and yes there are things wrong with this film:- <ul><li>The first 5 to 10 minutes do seem a little out of place: I understand the need to set the scene, but couldn't help feeling that the pace and characterisations didn't quite fit with what was to come.</li></ul><ul><li>Some of the characters take away from the story: Doug (Sean Astin) is a little over done and comes across as more damaged than his sister. Perhaps the worst, though, is Henry's female (?) assistant: this character was a mistake and did not belong in the film.</li></ul>In the end, these flaws don't matter: the film is enjoyable and that is what counts.The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the film believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. Some of the difficult aspects of the film are not ignored but properly dealt with. Clearly it is easy to read a sordid side into the idea of a man meeting a beautiful woman each day in the knowledge that she will forget everything and they can start again tomorrow. This is covered and Henry is asked some pointed questions; without giving anything away, his answers worked and leave us, the audience, able to enjoy the film, without any unpleasant nagging doubts or feelings of guilt.Don't analyse or pick holes; just watch this film. Chances are very good that you will enjoy it. It is a fantasy a bit of escapism: a first rate piece of entertainment and hopefully it will leave you, as it did me, feeling pleasantly content.",7,131,160,28 January 2005
The Hangover," It didn't really work for me.
","Clearly lots of people enjoyed this movie and even found it funny, so I certainly don't intend to insult what appears to be the majority, by suggesting that they don't know what they are talking about. Taste and humour are very personnel, so please read this review as one man's opinion.The humour on display here, strikes no cultural accord with me, yet is clearly popular in the US, which leads me to assume that this is idiosyncratically American humour (or should that be 'humor'?), though I mean no disrespect in drawing this conclusion. To me it was unsubtle and based almost entirely on put-downs and pratfalls - it was not sympathetic or comfortable; one would definitely have to laugh at someone, there was never that warm inclusive moment when one felt included in a instant of shared humour.As one would expect from the title the story as a whole was very predictable: This film was always going to rely on the set-up and delivery with the punch line, being less relevant, but not unimportant, since this is where the the audience would expect to find satisfaction: the themes, plot and sub-plots need resolution and vindication at this point and the extent to which this gives closure and satisfaction to the viewer is ultimately what helps to inform our overall impression. The idea of this movie is fairly well used, but still has plenty of life left in it: we start with a seemingly impossible and certainly implausible scenario and then unwind the story to show how it came about, finally winding it on to the point at which all the issues are resolved. Ideally we should find as the story unfolds relationships and pre-existing problems are also solved and resolved as the characters we come to love, grow as a result of their trials and vicissitudes. Unfortunately I didn't like any of the characters and at best I could only claim to have come to tolerate some of them by the end of the movie. To this extend there seems to be something of a groundswell agreeing with me from my perusal of other comments.The set-up when it finally happened - it would have been so much better as the opening scene - was reasonably inventive and certainly had scope, but... We had already met the characters by this stage - opinions were formed! I can not believe I am alone in finding the juxtaposition of the Alan Garner character and the baby as anything other than uncomfortable. For me as for every parent, I would assume, the idea of a baby with a character that has told us he is banned from going near schools is completely drained of humour.From here on the film proceeded as a succession of vignettes and comedy sketches, with the main characters taking a level of damage that would have finished Wile E. Coyote, yet carrying on little scathed. There were uncomfortable moments, but there were no moments of tension. It wasn't that one did not care what happened to these people (though I didn't much), it was more a case that the 'comedy' seemed to imply the characters were indestructible in a cartoon-like way and therefore not requiring of our care or sympathy. Which leads to the denouement (the punchline) which for me was sloppy and hurried. It was more a mad-cap ticking off of items on a list than a careful and satisfying final weaving of the various story threads into a triumphal and complete ending.This is definitely for those who enjoy sight-gags and humour that tends to the slapstick end of the comedy spectrum. Those looking for dry humour, one-liners, satire, pastiche or the more cerebral styles will not be so well catered for.I cannot pronounce against what is clearly not my cup of tea, but by defining what did not work for me I would hope to help others who's tastes might be more conformant with mine own.",4,2,6,25 July 2009
The Hunger Games," Turkish Delight!
","The kind that Edmund was given by the White Witch – it tastes good initially, but it does not leave you with a good feeling.This is a well-made film and it does the book justice; so much so that it throws a particular aspect of that book into stark relief. The ancient roman games were a visual spectacle and now that this film presents these 'Hunger' games as just that – a visual spectacle – there are questions that can no longer be left unasked.When I read the book I had to ask myself whether the story justified the violence. I found myself unconvinced – my problem was that for so much of the book, the violence was the story. Now I have watched the film I find my lack of conviction goes further; I worry that story is there simply as a metaphor to enable the violence.This is not a film about the horrors of a group of young children and teenagers forced into a gladiatorial arena; it is a film about that horrific gladiatorial combat.The film, like the book, is careful in its portrayal of the combatants; with one exception we are prevented from getting to know any of them. And that one – well she is used almost callously, for a moment of poignancy – a moment of meaning to counterpoint the meaninglessness of the violence that is playing out all around. So we have the death of Rue. She is killed and Katniss kills her killer. There is sorrow and sadness. Katniss sings to Rue and the body is laid to rest amongst flowers. But what of the young boy, he was only doing what was forced upon him – he was simply striving to live. No tears were shed for him. Of course not, he and the other 'red shirts' had to die. 'Bread and Circuses,' I can almost hear the cry.Ultimately everyone who watches this must find their own truths. I hope they will ask themselves why they watched and more importantly, how they feel about their reactions to this film. For me the real horror would be to hear that people enjoyed the killing and the violence.",5,0,1,11 August 2012
12 Monkeys," This could have been a great film, but
","The acting: really very good.The direction: clever, thematic and nicely understated.The plot: unbelievably simple  a six year old would easily spot the holes: - ah but we can't have that can we? So what to do? 'I know' someone says 'lets hide it.' This is where the film goes wrong: time travel is notoriously difficult to get right in terms of narrative so that it both works out and is internally consistent. Unfortunately the method used here was not to bother and just hope that if everything is sufficiently cryptic-seeming then no one would notice. To be fair this does seem to have worked at least partially judging by some of the reviews. I have a mathematical background and am a lover of science fiction and I am sorry but good acting and film-craft can't cover up a childish plot.Clearly the overly signalled end was the starting, and perhaps the only, plot premise of this entire film. This really means that the rest of the film was effectively filler to get us there and when analysed in terms of plot consistency this does seem the only possible conclusion. Let us look at some of the many really blatant faux pas:1. They are not very good at finding the right time or place. Yet they always manage to find the Earth and get there person on the surface wherever and whenever they inadvertently send him. (We will forgive this one: it is a biggie, but it is kind of necessary so lets be generous) 2. Why do they need this 'dead letter' method of passing messages if they can find there target when they inadvertently put him amongst the French forces in world war I or when the collect him from his hospital cell?3. What is the point anyway? They know when and where to find the first victim  so go back get a blood sample; end of problem.In those precious few moments in this film when we are given access to some actual plot we are presented with that tried and tested 'Time Travel' conundrum: what came first the cause or the effect? The 'If I hadn't tried to fix it there would not have been a problem to fix, so how did this get started anyway' question. Don't get me wrong, I realise this is the inevitable distillation of most good 'Time Travel' stories and if it is handled well and given a new or interesting spin it still has plenty of mileage left in it. Unfortunately there was nothing new or interesting here; there was not even a real attempt to make it fit with the ultimate (obvious from the beginning) plot twist.This film could have been so good, but no one likes being taken for a fool. So once one realises that in plot terms the king really does not have any clothes one really feels rather used and this makes the good parts of this film all the harder to appreciate or enjoy. Unfortunately a near miss often come off worse than something a good deal worse: compare this with 'Plan Nine from Outer space'; this is so nearly a good film, yet 'Plan Nine' is arguably less annoying to watch!",5,4,14,31 January 2005
Clash of the Titans," If you know the story or enjoy a good film, please avoid this!
","I learnt the myth of Perseus and Andromeda as a boy when I started looking at the night sky and the constellations: Perseus, Andromeda, Cassopeia, Cepheus, Pegasus and Cetus.I guess most of us know this story about how the beautiful princess is punished by Poseidon after her mother Queen Cassopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than the Nereids. Andromeda is chained naked to a rock as a sacrifice to the cetus (a sea monster, but not a kraken). In the myth Perseus saves and weds his princess, though there is a spot of bother at the wedding and 'yes', Pegasus and Medusa Gorgon do come into it.The 1981 film did not stray too far from the story and in addition we had Judy Bowker and Ursula Andress to look at, along with Ray Harryhausen special effects and a pretty decent cast. All in all I was quite satisfied.I have a soft spot for this story, so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately the director and screen writers saw things differently and seem to have gone out of their way to ensure that I would be completely and utterly disappointed and have left me asking these questions:<ul><li>Why was there no character development?</li></ul><ul><li>Wouldn't it have been nice to allow the actors and actresses a chance to act?</li></ul><ul><li>The myth provides a rip-roaring yarn, why not use it?</li></ul><ul><li>Also I have to question why was Pegasus black? If this was some miss-guided attempt at political correctness, then it was just crass, insulting and hopefully born of ignorance.</li></ul><ul><li>Why was Andromeda roped to a wooden trestle on top of a building? Given the vast amounts of paintings and statuary depicting this scene all I can assume is that the Director and script-writers are sadly ignorant or worse they assume that we are.</li></ul><ul><li>Clearly this is meant to be an 'effects' driven movie; why then aren't the special effects special? Compared to the effects in other recent films, these are really not as good and are certainly not sufficient for a remake of a film with Ray Harryhausen special effects.</li></ul>I could go on and on, but then I would be just as boring as this turkey of a film. So, instead I choose to finish on a good point: Gemma Arterton - you know she really is most awfully pretty.",2,5,6,20 August 2010
The Da Vinci Code," Not deep, not Good and not the book! ...but it made money
","I really enjoyed the book. It was a thundering good read. Okay maybe the story lacked consistency and depth, but that doesn't matter: it did what it was meant to do - it entertained. For all those people who poke fun, pick holes or spend ages listing the errors, I have but one response: you are missing the point - it's fiction.So as you can see I was hoping for an entertaining and absorbing movie. Alright they were going to have to make the puzzles a little harder. I mean was there anyone who failed to solve the anagrams or mirror writing at first sight? (One criticism of the book that is hard not to concur with) In addition the script writers were going to have to be resourceful, since suspense would be difficult to engender given that the story was so well known and the plot admittedly a tad linear.Unfortunately the movie missed the mark by a country mile. Where the book was fast paced and enthralling the film was slow and uninvolving. The dialogue was trite and unbelievable and the plot completely mismanaged.The book certainly simplified the subject matter and adjusted facts to fit the plot, but it never insulted the reader - it assumed a knowing intelligence and a willful suspension of belief. The film however was crass and insulting in its treatment of the audience and the way it negligently failed to even bother to try and paper over the cracks and, indeed, chasms in what plot it allowed was extraordinary.As far as I can see there was but one single intent in making this movie - to make money!",3,2,4,14 July 2009
