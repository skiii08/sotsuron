Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 7.2/10 - Hello! This movie is below medicore level.
","Basically this movie has great effects and nothing else. The story is weak, the characters are annoying and the most of the scenes are just to fill the movie with some garbage. I don't understand, how anyone over 12 would rate this movie higher than 5.Star Wars does not automatically equal great movie.",Null,0,1,20 May 2001
