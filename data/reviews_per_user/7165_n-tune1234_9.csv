The Avengers," better than i expected
",this movie is a lot better than i expected. at first when i heard that they were making this movie i was quite exited as i love super hero sort of movies. i thought that this movie would probably be like other marvel movies where they had a load of talking at the start and then the action comes in a bit later. but unexpectedly this movie got on with the action straight away. i loved this movie it is truly one of this years must see films because it had breathtaking effects with a really funny side to it also.if i were to recommend this to anyone it would probably be every one who likes these sort of movies. with all the characters coming together to make one massive blockbuster seems like they did it. this would have to be one of the best films of the year and is a must see for any marvel hero fan. (i saw this movie in imax and it was awesome),10,3,8,4 June 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," the best
",the pirates of the Caribbean series has been one of my favourite films for years. but as the other stories were based on the love of will turner and elizabeth swan luckily this one doesn't it's mostly based around jack.this movie for me is surely the best in the series which is a lot to say because i quite like the other 3 stories a lot. this one has a lot more focus on the main story. cpt.jack made great humour again which is sometimes a bit daft but oh well. i would recommend this to anyone who first of all liked the first 3 movies and to anyone who likes comedy thrillers.,10,1,2,4 June 2012

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," best mission
",best mission yet. this movie is the best out of the mission impossible series with spectacular effects on the edge of action and really sophisticated humour. this is without doubt one of the most exciting films of mission impossible i have ever seen.the plot seemed a bit complicating but after a second viewing i got the storyline straight away. for me the film felt a bit too quick because i really enjoyed it. the scene in which cruise is climbing up the building and the one in which the kremlin blows up i thought was amazing. i would watch this film loads of times because i thought it was brilliant.i would recommend this to everyone because its a must see movie and is surely one of my most favourite anticipated movies.,10,2,2,3 June 2012
Jurassic World," Best it could have been
",Now to start off I'm a massive fan of the Jurassic park franchise and have enjoyed all three instalments in the franchise.So obviously I have been waiting for this movie for a long time and the question is did it disappoint. Well no this movie was absolutely brilliant for what is was a monster movie. Now this one has lots of nods to the original so if your a fan of the first your gonna love those.However is the movie perfect...no that's because there are characters that felt a little too cartoonish to be real and the movie does have a slow introduction to Chris Pratt's character but once he comes in the movie gets quite interesting.The movie also feels as though it is remaking the first two films with some scenes that were clearly put in the movie because it worked great in the first two.All in all you come to this movie expecting dinosaurs wreaking havoc amongst the island and that's exactly what you get and it pays off as a great entry into the franchise and leaves you wanting more (sequel maybe).,10,19,47,14 June 2015
The Hangover Part II," pretty good
",this sequel to the first movie is pretty good for anyone who enjoyed the first movie with another brilliant plot and great humour. this time its stues wedding and they're going all the way to thailand for it. they try to stop another one of these things happening but after a drink on the beach it happens all over again this time they lose teddy the brides brother and have to find him before the wedding.this movie in a way felt like a remake just with different things happening to them and replacing the old things with new things . but still this is a good movie and anyone who liked the first movie should like this one.,10,2,3,2 June 2012
Prometheus," the best
",This is one of the best films i have ever seen. it's acting was brilliant. the effects blew me away as they were absolutely stunning. i had to watch it twice because if you watch it once you'll miss something that was probably vital to the story. don't listen to all the rubbish reviews because all those people expected a direct prequel to alien. trust me if your an alien fan then your gonna love this. i can't think of any other way they could have made it better as it was one of my favourite films of all time. i recommend this to anyone who loves sci-fi movies and to anyone who loves or likes the alien saga. i have given it 10 stars for it's brilliant effects brilliant story line and really well acting.,10,6,17,21 October 2012
Taken 2," just as good as the first
",The best sequel to a movie i have said was to be one of my favourite really pulled off for taken 2.The story of the film is that one of the guys brian killed in the first instalment hunts him and everyone around him to get revenge.i thought that it was absolutely brilliant as it still had the action and drama the first had. i don't know why people say this is bad because it really isn't.i would recommend the film to any fans of the first as this one is brilliant so if you want to watch the sequel to one of the best action films made then this is definitely worth a watch.,10,4,8,7 March 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," long movie
",the transformers series is going a little too far now. this film like all the transformers films are is long. there are some bits that aren't necessarily needed. don't get me wrong it's a great movie it's just that it's on for hours. the films ending seemed to me like it was a bit of a rush to get finished but i still like it. the story line to this movie in the franchise is the best for me. out of all the transformers movies this one has to be my favourite just because of the amazing special effects. i think that they should ma'be start coming to the end of this franchise now because every new plot has a complicating story line to it. if you watch the movie from start to finish you'll be able to get it but if you have a break you are bound to miss an important key to the story.watch it if you like apocalypse type of movies as the ending sort of seems like it's going to head that way plus watch it if you've watched the rest of the series as you won't be disappointed,8,8,10,4 June 2012
