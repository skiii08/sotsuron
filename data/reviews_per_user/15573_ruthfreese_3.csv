Walk the Line," over-hyped
","This movie was two hours of sad, un-involving story sandwiched around a few minutes of quite nice music. Here's Johnny drunk. Here's Johnny stoned. Here's Johnny trashing a room. Here's Johnny fighting with his wife. Here's Johnny broke and living in a seedy apartment. Here's Johnny hitting on June. Here's June for some unfathomable reason liking the guy. Presumably they got along well in real life, as they stayed married for thirty (?) years, but watching this show makes me wonder why she would ever get together with him in the first place. He seemed to be stalking her. I kept waiting for her to take out a restraining order on the guy. The rest of the time he was either moping or drunk. He never talked to his band mates or told a funny story or even cracked a smile. This movie left me completely cold.",3,1,7,6 July 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Clichés in search of a plot.
","Well, this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure doesn't live up to the hype. If you like the beginning, keep watching. If you're not enthralled, don't tough it out waiting for it to get better, because it doesn't.The premise is classic Hollywood, so full of clichés that I was surprised it was an Indy film. Take an adorable but cantankerous vehicle, fill it with lovable eccentrics, and send them off with an implausible excuse for a road trip. Add long peaceful scenes of bonding, a frantic race, and a warm fuzzy scene where everyone realizes it's okay to be who they are...and that's the movie.Oh, and can anyone explain to me why the door spontaneously fell off the car? I suppose that was meant to be funny, but, well, kinda forced. I got a couple of chuckles out of it, but if you like road trip movies, I recommend Rat Race or Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.",3,4,12,14 January 2007
Flight," Flying scenes are BS
","I am a commercial pilot by profession. This crash scene is based very loosely on an Alaska Airways plane that crashed in 2000. Don't get your hopes up: your relatives could not have survived this catastrophic equipment failure if they'd had Whip, fueled by 3 lines of cocaine, at the helm. The elevator jammed 'full nose down' causing a descent rate of over 13,000 fpm, not 4000 fpm as stated in the movie, (which is a normal rate of descent for a jet). Other pilots flying by relayed to air traffic control that they saw this plane inverted, and in a steep nose down dive.Let's say for the sake of the argument that the pilots had managed to slow the plane down with spoilers, gear, and flaps, like Whip did, and then flipped it on its back:Realistically, the plane would have slowed from 13,000 fpm to 12,000 fpm and when flipped on its back the stress would have ripped off the tail.Assuming somehow that the pilots flipping the plane upside down had managed to level it off, the instant they turned it rightside up, the plane would have nosed down and crashed. This lovely controlled glide onto a field would never have happened. Oh, and also, when a plane goes on its back THE ENGINES DO NOT CATCH ON FIRE. The engines actually flame out due to fuel starvation due to the fuel inlets being at the bottom of the fuel tanks.After the crash scene, there are two hours of Whip being drunk while Nicole appears to have no problem remaining sober. There are also random people popping up praising Jesus.",1,100,188,28 November 2012
