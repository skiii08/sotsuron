Scarface," A true masterpiece
","Scarface (1983) is a epic about a poor Cuban refugee who kicks it to be a leading drug-dealer in Miami, Florida. The world was his, for a short moment...I've to say honestly, the moment when I considered this film a masterpiece, when I watched it the second time. The first time, it was too overwhelming, and for the undrained eye it looks boring.I think maybe that's the strength of Al Pacino. If you pay attention to Pacino, he can capture you. With his voice, eyes, even the way he walks. He is not big, not muscular, but he still can scares the hell of out people with his authority. He is a legend.This movie made him unforgettable, it was controversial in it's days, but lots of classics were like that. Pacino plays Tony Montana who chases down his American dream. Although he plays a criminal in the story, you will grow sympathy for him, because his emotions control him. He will do what he feels he should do, it's not always the right decision, you see that in the movie.The soundtrack is perfect. Giorgo Moroder will take you for a trip on coke with his high ill pitched synthesizer-sounds mixed with beats. The Gina and Elvira theme is the last track on the soundtrack and will give you goosebumps (or something). Synthesizer, with some piano backupped by a melancholic tone. It's a brilliant track. You hear all the emotions of the whole in this track.",Null,0,1,10 October 2003
