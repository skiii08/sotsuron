Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3: Movie Review
","After marveling at the cinematic brilliance of The Avengers last year, this year's first Marvel release fell incredibly short of anything close to marvelous. Iron Man 3 like much of the glorified suit of armour in the movie is a clanking hollow shell lacking any real body or substance. It sorely suffers from the titanic box office juggernaut Marvel's The Avengers proved to be and evoked overwhelming feelings of underwhelming disappointment and disenchantment upon its culmination. Damaged by a nonsensical antagonist swerve and a superhero over-utilizing his new remote play feature amidst inexcusable plot holes, aimless disjointed sub-plots, far-fetched role reversals and a sense of going through the motions, this Iron Man installment is nothing short of filler, used as a catalyst to fuel the next phase in the ongoing Avengers (revenue) machine.Iron Man 3 is a superhero movie sequel co-wrote and directed by Shane Black centered on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man; the third installment in the Iron Man film series and the seventh in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Set some time after the events of The Avengers, Iron Man 3 picks up with the supercilious genius industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man who is reeling from the alien invasion of New York, which is causing him to suffer prolonged insomnia and anxiety/panic attacks. Unable to curb his restlessness and anxiety he has taken to his workshop where he has built a legion of Iron Man suits, at the same time detaching himself from the outside world consequently creating tension with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Concurrently, the Mandarin, a relentless and merciless terrorist orchestrates a string of bombings that leave behind no distinguishable evidence. Stark stirs from his seclusion and issues a televised threat directly to the Mandarin when his world begins to be torn apart at the seams and those closest to him become embroiled, ultimately leading to him going on a good old fashioned revenge mission with one objective in mind; to take down the Mandarin.Robert Downey Jr. reprising his role as the brash billionaire playboy industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man is at his sardonic best, however, much of the dialogue Downey Jr. professes throughout the film seems on the verge of stand-up comedy rather than the empowering words of a man-made superhero. Also reprising her role as Pepper Potts is Gwyneth Paltrow, her performance though solid is plagued with an implausible narrative for her character, and the camaraderie between her and Downey Jr. seems forced at times. Ben Kingsley's portrayal of credulous Tony Slattery otherwise known as the Mandarin is good for what it is, and Don Cheadle as the Iron Patriot formerly the War Machine got lost in the narrative somewhat but nevertheless provided a satisfactory performance for the parts and dialogue he was given. On a more positive note, Guy Pearce provided a stellar performance as the unstable scientist Aldrich Killian, a rivaling industrialist to Tony Stark with an underlying resentment for his fledging genius counterpart. Nonetheless, despite a couple of passable performances, notably those of Downey Jr. and Pearce, Iron Man 3 was sorely lacking character portrayals worthy of the audience's time investment.Shane Black takes over the helm of the Iron Man film series from Jon Favreau after his lackluster Iron Man 2 and teams up with Robert Downey Jr. who he last worked with on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. In hindsight perhaps Iron Man 3 could have been renamed to suit its premise more; Remote Control Iron Man, maybe Pepper Man, possibly even Avengers Hangover, these would all suffice, but How a Rich Man Copes with Seeing Aliens seems to fit best. Too much of Tony Stark's vulnerability was exposed in this movie which diminished the character we have all warmed to, the exuberant larger-than-life billionaire playboy/superhero. By divulging Stark's susceptibility to the strains of life to the extent it has in Iron Man 3 it makes it a lot easier to understand if he were to finally hang up his proverbial boots for good; not a good thing for a superhero film series with unfinished business. In addition to this, there is an underlying disconnect from the outset much like Stark with his beloved iron suit(s) in a significant proportion of this movie, by opting for the sympathy vote it is apparent Black has alienated viewers such as myself who want to see a superhero at the height of their powers overcome evil. By the end the very thing that ties Tony Stark to Iron Man is away with the wind, which is ironically where big-budget filmmaking intelligence went when this movie was produced. Here's hoping the remaining parts of the Avengers machine have not depreciated like its iron core has evidently done.Even the post-credits sequence connected to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe seemed needless and afforded nothing to entice in terms of reasons to be eager to want to watch the forthcoming Avengers movie or the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. However, ironically the ending cameo encapsulated the essence of the entire Iron Man 3 movie, a psychiatric evaluation of a perturbed superhero.On the contrary, Iron Man 3 is not a categorical disaster; it packed in enough explosive action and vivacious backdrops into a lengthy 2 hour 15 minute running time to at least be aesthetically pleasing to the viewer. Although when you look behind the niceties there is not much to write home about.Nevertheless, Iron Man 3 is a frantic overblown popcorn flick that lacks any real conviction and can be only described as a damp squib. Like all superhero movies, the superhero is only as good as it's adversary, and in this case the adversary was not worthy. As a stand-alone franchise it's clearly demonstrable that it is suffering, as part of an even bigger picture, Iron Man's appeal is draining with only 5% power and the odds of it reaching maximum altitude again are slim to none.",6,2,4,13 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek Into Darkness: Movie Review
","Inundated with aesthetically breath-taking visuals, bolstered with a clever narrative though bordering on the convoluted, ameliorated by an inspired take on an iconic Starfleet adversary, and seasoned with a measure of treachery, deceit and duplicity, Star Trek Into Darkness is blockbuster entertainment on the grandest scale. Undaunted by the runaway success of its predecessor, it boldly sores into the stratosphere as a revitalized intergalactic colossus transcending the modern day science fiction genre. On its Vulcan side, Star Trek Into Darkness is an intelligently scripted, sophisticated and shrewd specimen. On its human side it is frequently tempestuous, regularly humorous and every so often affectionate, it spectacles the conflict of human emotions in the most turbulent of times. Furthermore, beset with nostalgia soaked token nods and references to Star Trek's of old, teeming with witty dialogue, and awash with exhilarating action, J.J. Abrams' second enterprising effort in the celebrated series has plenty to satisfy obstinate Trekkies and casual moviegoers alike. Star Trek Into Darkness is a science fiction action-adventure movie co-produced and directed by J.J. Abrams. It is the twelfth feature-length film entry in the Star Trek franchise and the sequel to Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot, based on the Star Trek science fiction entertainment franchise created and established by Gene Roddenberry in the mid-1960s. It commences with the U.S.S. Enterprise and its plucky crew whose exploratory voyage has steered them in the direction of a primitive civilization on the fictional-Class M planet Nibiru. When Starfleet's General Order number 1, the Prime Directive is infringed the impetuous yet cunning Captain James T. Kirk is summoned back to Earth where he is reduced in rank from captain to first officer under Admiral Christopher Pike's command who reoccupies control of the Enterprise. Simultaneously, an unrelenting and inexorable former Starfleet Commander, Jon Harrison has instigated and launched an attack on a top-secret Starfleet installation on Earth. When Starfleet's high-ranking officers' lives are put in jeopardy at the hands of Harrison, Kirk with personal retribution on his agenda re-assumes captaincy of the Enterprise, and he and his crew embark on a mission of vengeance behind enemy lines to seize a supposed former comrade who's appetite for devastation knows no bounds. As the Enterprise and its crew are catapulted into darkness at warp speed, it soon becomes apparent that everything is not as it seems; a far-reaching web of deceit and duplicity is untangled leading to an epic showdown where allegiances will be brought into question and sacrifices will have to be made.Reprising his role from Abrams' 2009 Star Trek is Chris Pine, who uniform to his previous outing provides a stellar performance as James T. Kirk, the courageous, self-assured captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise renowned for his many female exploits and his end justifies the means view on Starfleet orders. His portrayal of the fabled Captain Kirk is akin to that of William Shatner in his finest hour. Also reprising his role from Star Trek Into Darkness' predecessor is Zachary Quinto as Kirk's notorious cohort aboard the Enterprise, the unyielding, super-intelligent half-Vulcan half-human Spock. Quintos' portrayal of Spock is exemplary, markedly and strikingly similar to that of Leonard Nimoy, the original Mister Spock otherwise known as Spock Prime. His 'unintentionally' condescending normative judgement afforded for any of Kirk's dubious commands and his golden lecture like recitals of Starfleet directive are first-class. In consort with his razor-sharp retorts packed full of wit and his exemplification of emotional discovery, Quinto provides the movies stand-out performance amongst other remarkable character interpretations including that provided by Benedict Cumberbatch who plays the films main antagonist, the malevolent and genetically advanced former Starfleet Commander Jon Harrison. Cumberbatch is suitably menacing and articulates Harrison's dialogue in an especially chilling manner. In addition to this, his animated facial expressions and piercing stares mould an ominous character that translates on-screen to a believable and genuine threat to Starfleet and to the Enterprise. Karl Urban returning as Leonard 'Bones' McCoy with his cranky nostalgic wisecracks and gags is great, and Zoe Saldana reprising her character of Uhura is particularly good in her intimate scenes with Quinto/Spock, which divulge the plights in their strained relationship. From calamitous ruin to a triumphant rebirth, Abrams' second Trek sees the U.S.S. Enterprise experience a multitude of extremities, with the Enterprise and its exuberant crew looking as elegant as ever upon its full revival. Both of Abrams' entries in the formidable franchise are highly commendable and praiseworthy, but his latter effort with more nail-biting uncertainty and a splendidly unnerving villain slightly edges it. Star Trek Into Darkness and its precursor may be treading old ground, but it is doing it boldly. I have no reservation in saying that in the hands of J.J. Abrams, the Star Trek franchise will continue to live long and prosper. Dammit, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a fortune-teller.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Movie Review
","A stripped-down, more dogged entry in the ever-expanding crushing force that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Unwilling to rest on their laurels, Marvel with Captain America: The Winter Solider wisely swerves the increasingly flagging formulaic characteristics of the generic superhero blockbuster and explores more grown up, mature themes with its instilled political connotations of conspiracy, trusted intelligence agency infiltration and high-stakes espionage in a delectably self-assured way. The intimate close quarters, stealth driven combat scenes are akin to those of confident military actioners as opposed to Marvel's usual elaborate hulking action sequences; a refreshing deviation, although normal big-budget battling service is resumed in the latter parts of proceedings. Furthermore, new character introductions felt purposeful and detrimental to the plot and the antagonists served as believable threats not just role-fillers. Likewise, every twist was meaningful and intrinsically forced the audience to question the intentions and integrity of the characters we have come to know and invest in. With the past coming back to haunt Cap and his crew it really added weight to the ensuing events and now knowing history could come back to bite at anytime supplies food for thought to it's sister instalments still to come. Not knowing whom to trust, Capt. America felt like a real superhero in this movie, rather than just Steve Rogers, the superhuman that can run fast and jump high posing as the patriotic front of The Avengers.Chris Evans reprising his role as the cryogenically preserved, genetically optimized and physically superior World War II veteran, Steve Rogers/Captain America, affords a much-improved performance from his previous outing in The Avengers where there was too much fish-out-of- water emphasis placed on the first Avengers escapades. Evans comes on leaps and bounds as Captain America, especially when his backs against a wall and when the proverbial fate of the innocent really does rest solely on his shoulders. His already established humanistic elements were joined by some welcomed larger-than-life superhero characteristics rendering him more viable and believable as a gallant heroic saviour rather than just an impressive mortal being; more Captain America than Steve Rogers, which was a noteworthy plus point. In addition, his scenes with the foreboding Winter Soldier played by a striking Sebastian Stan were some of shining high points of the movie. Also reprising her role and armed with considerable screen time, Scarlett Johansson as the expertly trained sultry S.H.I.E.L.D. spy Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff delivers a tantalizing performance with an air of vulnerability in her narrative bolstering Johansson's Black Widow portrayal. Samuel L. Jackson as the all-knowing S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Nick Fury is at his derisive best. Nonetheless, Robert Redford is responsible for the standout performance in The Winter Soldier. His shifty Alexander Pierce is marvellous, and Redford's skillful way of developing a consistent aura that he has an ulterior motive throughout the film is testament to him as an actor. Amongst other character renderings, the Introduction of ex-military paratrooper Sam Wilson/Falcon enacted by Anthony Mackie was fine, was not overplayed and the character fitted seamlessly into the plot.The Winter Soldier is a markedly more sober and stark instalment when compared to its sister entries. Grounded on a solid premise, co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo take the niftily penned Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely script, and translate it onto the big screen as a strong, lean, grittily toned espionage action-thriller flick, chock-full of double-crosses together with political undertones and lofty ramifications worthy of interest. Apt character progression and expertly shot, mood-setting combat scenes served as the catalyst for success here. Also revealing the significance of past goings-on further validates the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. Quite possibly the next best entry only to The Avengers itself, Captain America: The Winter Solider has loaded yet another genre front running bullet into the Marvel gun. They will persist to make boatloads of money despite themselves but when they can still find ways to continue to deliver fresh-feeling movies, nine instalments down the line, it only bodes well for the future of the franchise. Here's hoping Marvel continues to throw spanners in the works and vary the story arcs up from film to film as they have successfully done here with The Winter Solider.",9,3,6,31 March 2014
Man of Steel," Man of Steel: Movie Review
","This looks like a (similar) job for Superman! Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Super Excuse me. For a big budget motion picture remake of perhaps the most recognizable comic book superhero Man of Steel is a tamely run-of-the-mill effort. It is generic blockbuster personified, and is a bleak, characterless, lacklustre, uninspiring, disjointed and overly rigid entry in an intermittent franchise, which ironically struggles to take off. What's the 'S' stand for? Well in my world it stands for Super-Serious as opposed to Superman. Never before has a superhero been so unwilling to express any discernible passion for their cause, simply maintaining an impassive poker face the whole time. The fate of mankind hangs in the balance, Superman to the rescue! Screams excitement right; however, Zack Snyder has somehow turned this tried and tested premise into a dreary, rather monotonous exploit, even if the visuals and set pieces verge on stunning; more dull and lifeless than dark and gritty. Henry Cavill is cool, calm and collected as Superman; however, he comes across overly reserved and emotionless far too often. Cavills' steely resolve is rarely visibly tested even if the goings-on impart otherwise, rendering his portrayal of Superman a tad difficult to adhere to on a humanistic level. In addition to this, he appears sound in the fabled suit but his rendering of the celebrated superhero comes across too deliberate and noticeably premeditated, although he does find his feet towards the end when the movie is given a much-needed shot of adrenaline. Man of Steel lacks fluidity, it is apportioned with often brisk and abrupt scene changes, and provides an unkempt collation and abstract composition of extracts and gestures to scenes from other movies. It is also complacent on character introduction, being naive in thinking we all know about the characters enough to not have to shed too much light on them; notably a lackadaisical introduction to Lois Lane and her backstory, further marred by a romance kindled out of thin air. All in all, Man of Steel supplies a moderately attention-grabbing experience, albeit unhurried and void of any palpable sentiment. In addition, it does not break any new ground and sets an overstatedly grim-faced tone that future installments in the notoriously up-and-down series that has experienced its fair share of highs and lows in the past will have to address if they are to garner the widespread approval of the audience.Maybe somebody should have gave Superman's cape a tug and told him you're doing it wrong.",4,0,0,14 November 2013
Django Unchained," Django Unchained: Movie Review
","Django Unchained is quintessential Quentin and it delivers in a way only Tarantino can deliver. As with all of his directorial endeavours, Tarantino fittingly adopted a shackles are off, anything goes mentality. This mentality in the case of Django Unchained effectively translated on-screen to a gripping, extravagant, bloodthirsty, perfectly paced, often-humorous escapade with a serious political undercurrent that is thoroughly enjoyable. It is most definitely history altering, indulgent, audacious and continually outrageous, but it does make for spectacular viewing.Django Unchained is a Spaghetti Western genre mash-up written and directed by Quentin Tarantino set in America's Deep South in the year 1858, two years before the Civil War. It follows Django, a slave given his freedom by a German-born dentist-turned-bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz, due to Schultz requiring Django's assistance in identifying the murderous and ruthless Brittle brothers. Whilst sharpening up on his bounty hunting skills, taught by Schultz, Schultz comes to learn about Django's wife, Broomhilda and his desire to track down and rescue her from captivity. Their adventure eventually steers them in the direction of a plantation, Candyland and its brutal proprietor, Calvin Candie, who Django and Schultz come to learn to be Broomhilda's current owner. Masked with an entirely fabricated charade, Django and Schultz gain access to Candyland but a bitter and hateful house slave called Stephen becomes wary of their true intentions.Christoph Waltz as the witty bounty hunter with a history in dentistry, Dr. King Schultz is the standout performance of the film, on top of several other excellent character portrayals, notably Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of brutally villainous yet subtly charming plantation owner, Calvin Candie. It is important to add however that the heavyweight performances given by Waltz and DiCaprio do in no way over-roar or overshadow Jamie Foxx's slave-turned bounty hunter, Django, he more than holds his own when it could have been so easy to have slipped under the radar and be forgiven, given that the cast assembled for this movie is so stacked. Samuel L. Jackson is the despicable, bitter and foulmouthed bootlicker house slave Stephen. Jackson and DiCaprio characterize a certain rapport between one another, this tells of a significant backstory between Stephen and Candie, which adds even more to the movies already substantial intrigue. However, Kerry Washington seems at times slightly insipid and a bit bland as Broomhilder, especially for a Tarantino movie, but she ups her game when necessary. With historical emphasis placed on Quentin Tarantino's last outing in that of Inglourious Basterds and on his latest project, Django Unchained, what immediately springs to mind is this guy would have been a cool history teacher. Only Tarantino could address Nazi Germany and pre-Civil War human trafficking so elaborately in successive films. Django unchained similar to Inglourious Basterds is a quirky, unconventional somewhat peculiar look at Quentin Tarantino's view of history. This movie provides an alternate depiction of the unapologetic world of human trafficking and slavery in the Antebellum Era of America's Deep South. Tarantino constantly reinvents fictional story-telling and takes it to a whole new level, Django Unchained is no different.As the film progresses it does not suffer from its 2 hour 46 minute running time. Given the considerably lengthy running time you would think your attention and will-power would be tested, however Tarantino has an ingenious way of making often over-the-top and sometimes excessive erudition engrossing and absorbing; a character building ploy that can be hit or miss, but Tarantino seems to hit it out of the park more often than not.The landscape of the movie is changed with a single handshake but the dynamic remains consistent, with the conflicting motives of love and revenge driving the film to an ultra-violent, blood-soaked conclusion. In this midst of this, Tarantino injects himself into proceedings just as it is conceivable that the movie is calming down somewhat, however, it manifested to be that this was simply the calm before the blood drenched storm. In addition to this, just as you think the movie is reaching a natural plateau, it immerses you in yet more blood-splattering action that will keep you hooked until the end and will leave you devilishly wanting more when it's over. It is important to profess nevertheless that the more pedestrian moments do not hurt the movie in any way attributable to Tarantino's knack of being able to gradually build tension and intrigue. On the contrary, it is also understandable that this movie may not be to everyone's taste, given its uncompromising and unrelenting in-your-face nature. Riddled with racially charged profanity it is easy to see why some people may take offence, and therefore not engage fully with what the film is trying to convey. Does Django Unchained transgress and at times cross the line? Certainly, but Tarantino has made a career out of crossing the proverbial line, and his expertly placed humour helps to soften the blow so to speak.When all is said and done, it ultimately boils down to a significantly important movie about pre-Civil War slavery, executed in a cartoonish, unorthodox yet alluring fashion befitting of the movies outlandishly eccentric dialogue, extraordinary settings and charismatic character portrayals.As with the other screenplay scripts Tarantino has penned, Django Unchained's dialogue is uniquely erudite and provoking in the best sense of the word; and also intelligently witty particularly for Dr. King Schultz's dialogue. The cinematography is outstanding, the lighting is fitting to each scene, and the satirical, parody-like whip sounds and sudden zooming in that are customary with old school westerns are just brilliant. Django Unchained is also stylistically revolutionary; the striking costume designs are daring and radical but all unquestionably add to the originality of the film. The soundtrack is superb; it captures the essence of the movies unabridged flamboyance and greatly compliments the ambiance and mood of each scene.",9,1,4,26 January 2013
