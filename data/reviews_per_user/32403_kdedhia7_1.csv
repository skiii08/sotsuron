Airlift," Goosebumps.
",First of all Thank You Mr Raj Krishna Menon and team for this movie. Brilliant direction and story. To show such subject on big screen in 2 hrs is big deal. The movie is excellent. Feels proud to be an Indian. Akshay Kumar at its best leaves you speechless. Specially during the emotional scenes. No doubt this is his best performance till date. Nimrat is fantastic. Amazing performance. Great chemistry with Ranjit. Her smile takes your breathe away. The VFX the cinematography are brilliant. People started clapping when the movie ended. The show was Housefull. Loved it. Every Indian Must Watch this movie.Airlift.,10,6,9,23 January 2016
