Blade Runner 2049," Slow much ?
","I will put my vote beside those who think first half hour of the movie totally kills the mood and the hype. This movie is at least half hour longer than it should has been. screenplay is very slow and it fails to put you in the heart of the events. I felt more engaged with Movie 'Her' when she was terminated than this time when her Cyborg wife dies.The thing is people always rate movies higher that gives them a nostalgic feeling about a prequel in the past .But of course this is the cons, I enjoyed some very good scenes , Good adaptation , Great acting and seeing some of my favorite actors/actresses together.",7,4,9,10 October 2017
Troy," an airplane wont change anything about this movie
","I'm considering it as one of the best movies ever cinemas has seen it .. what I'm about to say is it's not fair just because of an airplane You Multiply a legendary movie with zero ! after gladiator and brave heart I think troy is best adventure historical movie , please remember what's creating a high class movie takes and how much suffer & tiredness it causes .. Hollywood should be proud to have this movie.brad pitt doing very well in it as well as all other casts . the thing which killing me is this movie didn't won any Oscars and nominated for only one ! if it was about that airplane then I have to say it was biggest affair which has been ever seen.",9,0,1,24 March 2011
X-Men: Apocalypse," Don't get your hopes so high
","I think it's time to give up on X-Men. they are getting less and less creative with every movie . Yes i enjoyed it and it was well produced and great acting . but the plot wasn't enough satisfying . obviously bringing a huge weird shaped villain back from death or creating it is a very popular plot now adays from action movie . c'mon guys it was failure on avengers and look pretty well here too. also the movie suffered lack of Wolverine , a very slow start and screen playing didn't rhythm with events. still worth watching , you gonna catch some funny moments and some cool action .",6,7,18,20 May 2016
Avatar," new Ideas always become popular
","I expected that huge success from Avatar , always New Ideas become legendary & will receive its reward .there are rumors about its Idea has been stolen from a Chinese author but whatever Its so beautiful Idea & scenario .. Avatar will be a revolution on the movies history when part II , III will be finish . it's not a big surprise if a Jame's Cameron movie collect 10 billion $ everything is possible in his hands . its a big risk to give $237,000,000 for a movie , we have seen many movies with huge budgets failed to perform and being disaster for the company and producer .. Im so curious to see new Parts",7,3,6,24 March 2011
A Beautiful Mind," best ever i have seen
","For me this is the best Movie ever i have seen without any doubt ,, It's OK if it's not everyone's opinion , cause i admit I'm fantasy guy and I live in imagination almost as much as in reality . when first i watched this movie , i stood up and said WOW even i was in shock for a week .. Russell crowe showed the world what a high class movie means with that awesome acting and awesome directing by Ron Howard , unfortunately he hasn't any new movies in the last 5 years .. what made this movie perfect is that its the true story . i always love true story movies . My life is a big story & deserve to be a movie in future , i know many other have the same opinion about their lives but i really mean it .",10,0,0,24 March 2011
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A ruined effort
","I really felt bad and sorry for all those hard work to make this movie possible , yet it was kinda ruined by some small stupid details. despite everything i still loved it just like any other P.J Movies,, But i couldn't not to notice how bad it went from the scene when Dwarfs climbed the mountain till the end. I think it should have been more about the fight of 5 armies than killing time with some Drama and static emotions. when you are talking about a a huge war down there. you can't spend much time with one character thinking and thinking. also we didn't get to see the end of the war before the gate which i believe there should have been more minutes for there than the mountain. one thing else that really ruined it for me , was killing orcs by some small rocks and worse by a hobbit. not to mention the scene killing to orcs by the son of brad while he never knew how to use a sword. the only things orcs are good at it is fighting. I loved the Idea of the five armies battle , but there should have been a better story line and better priorities",7,7,14,12 December 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," One of the best Action movies you will ever see
","There aren't a lot of movies who get better in second chapter. But john wick surely did it. Everything was simply perfect from the start to the finish. There is no way anyone else could have done better than Keanu Reeves. His wooden character was once again used at the best possible way same as Matrix. It's been awhile since last time i was so hyped that i was laughing and clapping from amazement at cinema. Cinematography , story , sound tracks are incredible. It's time an action movie wins some awards.",9,3,8,15 February 2017
Spectre," Wasted Effort
","A great Production with a very Poor Plot.So poor they totally ruined the movie for me.here are some :**************SPOILER ALERT*****************<ul><li>The way he just went to Oberhauser's Hand was so foolish and poor for 007</li></ul><ul><li>There was an ambulance and cop right after helicopter crashed. took less than a minute.</li></ul><ul><li>when he rescued D.Swan , before the building explodes . they jumped into a safe attachment landed by Oberhauser. I mean if you wanna kill somebody , you ain't gonna say OK let me put this here in case the person i wanna kill wants to survive</li></ul><ul><li>There are a lot of unnecessary taking them as hostages . while they could finish them and there were no reason to keep them Alive. But No i should keep them until they escape.</li></ul><ul><li>The whole movie is just a long run , hide , escape plot.</li></ul><ul><li>The way they easily took control of world's information system by a small unknown group , seemed unsatisfying for me .</li></ul>",6,2,5,16 November 2015
Warcraft," Underrated AVATAR
","this movie was better than most of us expected it . few days ago we had a huge argument with a friend over X-men : Apocalypse . i hated that movie and he loved it . But to realize how slow , boring and bad Apocalypse was you should watch this movie . incredible CGI , good acting , unexpected ending , touching moments and awesome fights . Travis fimmel was outstanding however he lacked originality , he had the same character exactly as ragner in vikings . also the plot lacked originality when used Star wars reference for the fight between light and dark forces , though it can be due to the plot of the game which i haven't played.One thing that caught my eyes , was the way it looked like avatar with awesome screenplay and CGI . Warcraft has everything that made Avatar famous and if you ask me its even better .",9,9,16,4 June 2016
