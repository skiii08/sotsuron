Hereditary," Compelled to write this
","As usual the movie reviewing public is at their lowest as they scramble to either overly hate something (these people who give a 1 to a movie indicating it has no merits at all and think some how it is the worst thing ever made or at least in line with one ) or overly praise it (people who give it a perfect score like it has no problem and it should be up for the academy award for best picture ) . It's ok, people, to think a movie is some times mediocre. And that's where we find Hereditary. For me, the film rises weakly above mediocre horror fare of recent years , but just barely . It is no waste of time or garbage as these 1 star reviewers would have you believe , but it is a slow burn filled with great character moments and exploration of how we react to horrific events... but that's where we will lose those kind of viewers , they mostly see this as boring and are looking for constant jump scares. I get it , I do , the movie does have the sin of feeling its run time , something you never want your viewers to do. But I have to admit I was glued to the screen throughout and couldn't wait to see where it would go . It's where it goes that loses me and probably has the reviewers giving it a perfect score boasting it for being so different and demented . The movie is confused and because of this there's two different films living in one space fighting for control , one movie that is a horrific drama that is interesting and thought provoking, filled to the brim with emotional human darkness and the film we ended up getting ,a typical horror movie that you can clearly see coming from a mile away . It's that turn that hurts it, destroying what could have been amazing and leaves you walking out very unsatasfied . maybe that's what the movie intended and if so I applaud the director and writer ,just don't ask me to say this is an amazing movie . It isn't . What I'll say is that it is a well shot , well acted , suspenseful horror drama that doesn't need to rely on jump scares to be creepy and unnerving , but it will feel long , confused and unfortunately cause unintentional nervous laughing and will end with a unsatasfied taste in your mouth.",7,1,4,9 June 2018
Knives Out," Quite good whodunit
","This movie actually does something quite interesting, it tells you whodunit right up front. To be honest this took me by surprise and I was pleased to find out that what follows is where the mystery starts actually unraveling. Actors are all great in their roles , although most are barely on screen and that's a shame with such a great cast . But it flows very well and things find a way to make the audience react at the right moments , this is due to some nicely directed moments and some perfectly read dialogue. I would have loved this film and given it a much higher score if it just had a little something more . If the twist wasn't so damn noticable to the point of making you say 'it can't be that because it's to obvious' . If there was just a tad more meat on its bones. I'm being a tad picky , it's a fun and perfect way to enjoy a couple hours. Go check it out.",7,17,50,23 November 2019
