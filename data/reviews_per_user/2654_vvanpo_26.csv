Scarface," Pacino Vortex
","21 years after release, I finally seize the opportunity to watch 'Scarface' in its entirety.  It's all about Pacino.  He's why I rated it as high as 8 stars and he's why I rated it as low as 8 stars.  With the direction of Brian de Palma and the script of Oliver Stone, the stars align to allow Pacino to blaze like a meteor.But oh that accent!  'Scarface' was made long enough ago that many of the roles of Latin characters were filled by Italian-American actors which of course includes Pacino.  I have a co-worker who occasionally affects an accent (he's of Mexican heritage himself) to get laughs. I discovered he got it from Pacino here.But Pacino can't be denied his use of the f-word.  In fact, it should be decreed that only Al Pacino can say the f-word.  With 'Scarface' and continuing with fare like 'Glengarry Glen Ross' and 'Heat', no one can bark the f-word as juicily as Al Pacino.",8,1,2,8 August 2004
Love and Death," Bergman meets the Marx Brothers
",Vintage Allen comedy with skit-like scenes that are his forte.  It's been commented that Woody spoofs Ingmar Bergman here but he also plays out a lot of scenes as if they're set in Freedonia instead of Czarist Russia.'Love and Death' has aged a bit.  The 'Love' part is more aptly about adolescent sexual escapades than heartfelt and soulful love.  'Death' still zings with Allen's irreverent best.Kudos to Woody for giving Diane Keaton as many one-liners as himself.  Still good for many laughs.Can I leave now?,7,2,3,14 June 2004
Miracle," Rousing
","I've never been a fan of hockey.  But I always have been a fan of the Olympics, even the winter Olympics and would watch the hockey events there. So I was a living spectator, on TV of course, of the US Men's Hockey team's miracle run to the gold.'Miracle' gave me some new surprises about what it took for Herb Brooks (masterfully played by Kurt Russell) to prepare the team.  The first surprise comes with the simple passage of time.  I was only 23 years old at the time of the Lake Placid Olympics so I wouldn't remark on the young age of the players.  But now, wow!, average age of only 21.I figured the team had to work very, very hard to prepare and the film shows the rigors of Brook's training, both physically and mentally but I had no idea he had only seven months to mold them into a team.Sports shows always show last second winning shots of events, but I discovered how important a couple of last second tieing shots were to keep the Dream alive.'Miracle' shows as its denouement, as expected, plenty of action from the game against the Soviet Union.  The movie takes you right on the ice and you experience the battlefield ballet that is hockey.  Really intense and exhilarating.My only quibble is it treats the Gold Medal game against Finland as an afterthought. As any sports fan knows, sentimentality rarely meets reality. I think for the US team to come back after such an emotional charge to win again is the grand finale of amazing feats they performed.",9,0,0,14 February 2004
Underworld," Gothic Soap Opera
","'Underworld' posits the notion that vampires and lycans (werewolves) have a long, lurid history together.  It's a soap of backstabbing (and graphic frontstabbing for that matter) and hidden agendas revolving around a human who clashes their histories violently asunder.The movie is a lot of style but not much substance.  Dark and rainy nights, bounteous leather painted in greys and blood red.  I found it to be middling.  The only thing that sticks in my mind about it is how almost all the characters in it are non-human.  The special man I alluded to before doesn't remain human for long.  Can't say that about too many film especially those using live actors.",6,0,0,18 October 2003
12 Monkeys," Too clever by half
","I love the work of Terry Gilliam.  He is one of my favorites.  Alas Twelve Monkeys isn't one of them.  I'm not saying it's a bad movie.  I just can't get my arms around this one.One of my problems with it is the time travel aspect.  I don't believe in time travel.  I find it impossible to believe that the cosmos are marks on the tape of time.  Events define time; time doesn't define events.  And in the entertainment cosmos, time travel is used too much as a device of convenience.  In Twelve Monkeys, Bruce Willis' character is sent back to a time when a deadly agent is released around the globe resulting in the deaths of 5 billion.  Confusingly, he can't alter events but is only expected to retrieve a sample of the agent to take back to his present.Another big problem is the Brad Pitt character.  Movies love the giddy and manic crazy person.  Brad Pitt is this - too much so.  It's so apparent that Brad is acting crazy although in his defense, I don't know what actor could do better.  What's worse is his character is a leader of a group of activists which is absurd.  Insanity is a sad and lonely place.",6,1,5,18 February 2003
L.A. Confidential," Seamless
","Entertaining pulp fiction filled with the denizens of the underbelly of 1950's Los Angeles.  'L.A. Confidential'  has a gripping, gritty storyline propelled with a cornucopia of compelling characters.  A web of intrigue woven so tight that you'll want to watch over and over again to enjoy the creation of every strand.Some of my favorite movies are those that use narration as an effective device.  'L.A. Confidential' is no exception.  It uses narration to set up the plot with the twist that the narrator is a columnist for a gossip rag who is a party and a part to the goings-on.Ten lines?  When did this start?",10,1,3,18 April 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Still brilliant after 40 years
","Many is the instance of a show that upon first viewing dazzles and charms but after it has been put snugly into the bed of our memories, when it reawakens in our eyes after a long sleep, it looks shopworn and grizzled.What joy it is to behold the exceptions, the exceptional supernovas such as 'Dr. Strangelove'. Direction, writing and acting are all top-notch.And what acting! Sterling Hayden as General Ripper who takes sexual dysfunction to a whole unimaginable level. George C. Scott as General Turgidsen who always can see the silver lining in even the darkest mushroom cloud. Topping this stellar list is the incomparable Peter Sellers in a triple role. His phone conversations as President Muffley with the unheard Soviet Premier is a classic in comedy that leaves me in stitches.Stanley Kubrick directs the three story lines with a sure hand but yet also inspiring. I still get tingles in my spine watching Slim Picken whooping and hollering as he rides the a-bomb like a bull before triggering Armageddon.Like the subtitle says, you've got to laugh to avoid the despairing truth that man loves his precious pettiness even while the world is literally blowing up around him.",10,1,3,13 April 2005
Lost in Translation," Dazed and Confused in Japan
","Johansson and Murray are sleepless in Tokyo Japan, 'Lost in Translation''s third star.  This is a simple yet effective story of two lonely and unsure Americans making a connection in the fascinating but intimidating Land of the Rising Sun.  Ms. Coppola brings out the most of her three stars.  I felt as fascinated and intimidated as the couple.  I cared about them.I read that Sofia Coppola pleaded for Bill Murray to play the role of Bob Harris, the weary, retreaded action movie hero.  I'm glad he relented.  Mr. Murray has a knack of following cynicism with gentleness.Ms. Johansson conducts herself more maturely than her 18 years would indicate.  A pleasantly surprising performance.",7,0,0,18 October 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Cute and that's a good thing
","Pixar strikes the imagination mother lode again with 'Monster's Inc.'  The movie has a pleasing premise that monsters scare little children so the monsters can harness the children's screams as energy to run their monster world.  The story follows the monsters' top 'Scarer' Sully and how he becomes a new man, er, monster when a very cute little girl named Boo comes into his life.The animation is incredible.  I'm amazed at how freakish monsters could express human emotions so effectively and with sincere affectation. 'Monster's Inc.' doesn't have as many laughs as the Toy Story movies but it made me feel just as good.  Recommended.",8,1,2,9 March 2003
The Italian Job," Mini Superhero
","I enjoyed this movie.  More than I expected.  It has enough action, intrigue and locations to make it worth your while.  While I can't quite yet see Mark Wahlberg as a leader, he's gotten good enough to be a credible manager and that's OK.The superhero of the movie is the Mini Cooper.  It's shown to have the speed, dexterity and muscle to pull off any job.   And to handle a maniac driver like Charlize Theron's character.",8,0,0,12 June 2003
28 Weeks Later," Stupid Kids
","I liked '28 Days Later...' and while not exactly eagerly anticipating a sequel but if one came out, I would definitely see it.Regrettably, I didn't like it as much as the first.One of my favorite movies, 'Aliens', contains a line to the effect 'In case you haven't been keeping up with current events, we're getting our (bleep) kicked!' That's my main problem with '28 Weeks Later'. There are too many situations where the characters aren't keeping up with current events. A savage disease had just ravaged mankind on the island of Great Britain where the infected had maniacally spread the disease by attacking the non-infected. I'd think that would serve ample warning to those trying to repopulate the island.But, no. And the Harris children were the worst.The story revolves around the Harris family. Father Don (Robert Carlyle) and Mother Alice (Catherine McCormack) found themselves stuck in England but the children Tammy (bright-eyed Imogen Poots) and Andy (shaggy Mackintosh Muggleton) were able to be shipped off to a refugee camp in Spain.The opening sequence shows Don barely escaping an attack from the infected but Alice is not so lucky. Don makes to an area in London where, after all the infected have starved to death, a NATO operation led by U.S. troops begins the process of starting over again. It is here that he is reunited with his children.Trouble starts when Andy craves a memento of Mom. So the he and his sis sneak off the area that's supposedly a fortress to keep out the infected should they happen to still roam the country. These two should have been scared straight about the risks they are taking.That's just the first instance and it's not just with the kids. To me this spoiled the movie. I need this movie to give me sense and sensibility because it sure needs to overcome its gloominess.Another pet peeve is the many scenes shot with a jerky hand-held camera. That style is played out.",4,0,1,21 May 2007
Cold Mountain," Movie passes but not Mountains
","Starting in I had a trepidation that 'Cold Mountain' was going to be sympathetic to the South. It takes place in the fictional town of Cold Mountain in western North Carolina.  The townfolk are constructing a church in anticipation of the arrival of the new pastor (Canadian Donald Sutherland) and his daughter (raised in Australia Nicole Kidman).  Sparks eventually fly between the daughter, Ada, and a carpenter, Inman (Englishman Jude Law).The romance between the two is supposedly the main plot point sustaining the movie but it's really to demonstrate the futility and eventual desperation of the Confederacy.  When war was announced, the menfolk of the town were enthusiastic to join the fight.  Three years later, some of them - those that haven't died - have had their fill of fighting and try to return home as deserters.Here's where the dramatic tension comes in the film.  The South had set up a Home Guard, a force granted powers to ensure deserters and the people who sheltered them were punished.  Naturally the Home Guard abused those powers and that's what we see in 'Cold Mountain'.I read one negative review regarding the lack of African-Americans in the film.  It is true their are very few scenes with slaves but I let is slide because the scenes take place mainly in the Appalachians where slavery was not common.  Indeed it gets me to thinking why the people there would want to fight for a system that was against their interests.What did confuse me were the mountains.  The Appalachians are ancient and rounded.  The film was shot in Romania and its craggy Carpathians.  I expected to see troikas in the mountain snow scenes.Lastly a reviewer remarked the Renee Zellweger appeared to be channeling Granny Clampett.  It was meant as a insult but I like that.  I now think of her character as Granny Clampett's Granny.",7,0,0,7 March 2004
The Alamo," Touching performance from Billy Bob
","I enjoy historical dramas and I have to include 'The Alamo' on the list.  It made me read up on a bit of history about the Alamo and was surprised to learn no one knew for sure the actual events of the fall of the Alamo.  The surviving members of the Mexican Army gave varying accounts.  So the filmmakers here had to naturally engage in some speculation as to what transpired.  I found their choices plausible.The reason Mexico lost a large portion of its territory was due in large part to it and its army being led by a megalomaniacal dandy.I want to give praise to Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of David Crockett, America's first celebrity.  It is sensitive, smart and brave.One sad consequence of this movie's release has been to bring forth from the slime loathsome racists to infest imdb's message boards.  To them, US crimes against humanity is justified because of all the great stuff Americans eventually invented.  Ironic really in the context of the Alamo as the 'Texians' were seeking an independent nation apart from the US as well as Mexico.",8,3,4,18 April 2004
Van Helsing," Trepidations Mainly Allayed
","The local film critic panned this movie.  The audience attending laughed derisively.  One of the things he complained about was the saturation of special effects.  I was concerned about this.  I love special effects.  I love monster movies.  But when I saw 'Hellboy' a couple of weeks before, I had my fill.  It simply failed to engage me.  I was fearing the same with 'Van Helsing'.In promotions for the movie, director Stephen Sommers appeared really enthusiastic about making it.  It shows in the final product.  'Van Helsing' is good, campy fun.  I didn't mind all the special effects.  The storyline managed to work out all the 'relationships' between the classic movie monsters totally tongue in cheek.Lay back and enjoy.",7,1,2,12 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Hail Hermione
","I had the pleasure of watching 'POA' in an IMAX theater.  It made the scenes such as Harry riding the hippogriff breathtaking.I've seen and enjoyed the first two movies of the 'Harry Potter' series.  I haven't read one word of the books.  But after seeing 'POA', I now want to read the books.  More so, I'm curious to know how author J.K. Rowling will finish the series.  I read speculation on the fate of Harry Potter and it got me to speculate too.I believe Emma Watson's performance as Hermione will influence Ms. Rowling in the direction she takes the rest of the books.  Hermione shows off 'grrl power' far in excess of the often-played clip of her punching Malfoy.  Ms. Watson makes me believe that Hermione's power will take her to unexpected heights.",10,0,0,14 June 2004
Black Hawk Down," 'Hello? Hello?'
",Ridley Scott puts us into battle with his bloody and gritty 'Black Hawk Down'.  He effectively recreates the chaos and confusion of warfare.  The danger of city fighting to both soldier and civilian is palpable.Good movies have scenes that stick in my mind.  A couple from 'Black Hawk Down' include the US soldier grabbing a magazine from a dead militia man showing that American soldiers had their lives threatened and sometimes extinguished by weapons made in the USA.  Another was when the troops were cheered as heroes just a few blocks away from where they were treated as the enemy.Some interesting trivia from this movie:Eric Bana is from Australia. Ewan McGregor is from Scotland. Jason Isaacs is from England. Ewen Bremner is from Scotland. Is Tom Hardy from England? Hugh Dancy is from England. Zeljko Ivanek is from Slovenia. Matthew Marsden is from the UK. Orlando Bloom is from England. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is from Denmark. Kim Coates is from Canada. Ian Virgo moved to Wales as a child.My summary is a bit of trivia too.  Can you guess?,9,0,1,19 April 2003
The Last Samurai," Tragic Warrior
","Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a drunken shell of a man racked with guilt over his participation in the genocide of Native Americans as a U.S. soldier.  He is convinced by representatives of the Japanese government to train their ragtag troops to fight against the samurai.In their first battle against the samurai, the army is routed and Algren is captured.  He switches allegiance to the samurai after staying with them, learning their ways.  I suspect he is trying to find honor as a warrior by reversing his role into the Indian's.This is where I find it hard to embrace the picture.  I don't think the samurai are noble.  Indeed they are foolish in the face of modern weaponry. And Algren is a tragic figure.  He can't return to America where his demons lie but he also stands apart in Japan as a foreigner.",7,0,0,26 January 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Enjoyable characters
","I really like this movie, even more than the first.  It is imaginative with the special effects, many of them done with a warm sense of humor. 
Best of all are the characters.  Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy and Jason Isaacs as Draco's father Lucius are hissable.  Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is huggable.  Richard Harris as Dumbledore is honorable.The pinnacle is the chemistry of the three main characters.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint (which could be a great character name itself) as Ron Weasley act like they are true friends to the end.  I especially like Emma as Hermione.  She is such a darling!A great adventure.",9,3,5,3 March 2003
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Sentimental Favorite
",This is Alec Guinness' movie.  He takes the lead in the exploration of the dual nature of pride.  It is his character's virtue in defying his enemy but his sin when it makes him oblivious to aiding his enemy.'Bridge' also happens to feature my dream work place.  The British Majors' office is an open-air bungalow in a botanical garden on top of a hill overlooking the lush island of Ceylon.  Wonderful.,10,1,3,23 November 2003
Man on Fire," Insult to Mexico
","Denzel Washington plays a man whose soul has been leached out of his body by the demands of his job (the back of his hand shows the scars of cigarette burns.  Sustained only by the bottle, he travels to Mexico City to go to a friend and former comrade in arms (the always good Christopher Walken) to seek a job.  Walken suggests going into the bodyguard business.  There's an epidemic of kidnappings for cash in the country and protection is a growth industry.  Washington's character, Creasy, hooks up with a wealthy Mexican business who has a darling daughter played by Dakota Fanning to protect.Now Dakota does a fine job of acting but even with a blonde American mother she's about as Latin as her namesake.When Dakota does eventually get kidnapped, Creasy goes Death Wish on the corrupt Mexican citizenry.  You see little Pita (Fanning) has brought a bit of humanity back to Creasy so his logic tells him it's acceptable to get medieval on those he feels responsible.The producers thanked Mexico City for being a special place.  If I was the city, I wouldn't invite them back.",4,6,13,30 May 2004
Vanilla Sky," What was that again?
",I am one who would see this a second time around armed with what I learned the first time.  That in and of itself shows that I enjoyed watching 'Vanilla Sky' and will do so again.Two questions come to my mind when I think of 'Vanilla Sky':Was Julie (Cameron Diaz) really motivated to do what she does?  It's the trigger for what happens during the rest of the movie.How did Kurt Russell prepare for his role?  That must have been a kick to do.Penelope Cruz is cute.  That's all.  See it twice.,9,0,1,26 January 2004
X2: X-Men United," Resisting Paranoia
","I couldn't but help while watching this movie to put it into the context of our times.  How we would react, or over-react to 'mutants' within our midst? I was quite impressed with the restraint most of the mutants showed in exercising their powers.  They have the capability to really wreck some havoc.  'X2' had circumstances where all the mutants had to unite.  I look forward to future episodes where they will battle each other over how they should or shouldn't live with humans.Aside from the philosophical aspects, 'X2' is action-packed and compelling. Eight stars.",8,0,0,22 May 2003
Heat," Going in Depth
","Sure, 'Heat' is a top-notch crime drama with bold action and gritty details but Michael Mann has created something special by exploring the characters more deeply.  Within its 2.75 hour running time is enough room to show the consequences of the choices both the cops and the robbers make to themselves and their loved ones.  That includes those characters that would get little or no lines in other films.And there's Al Pacino being Pacino.  It doesn't matter if his character is good or bad, divine or evil, sinner or saint, as long as he gets to pursue his art passionately.Excellent work.",10,0,0,9 February 2004
Braveheart," Evocative but Troubling
","After watching Braveheart, I can't help but wonder how much of an influence starring in 'Mad Max' was on Mel Gibson's film making. Maybe the then young actor landed a role that matched his view of good and evil just through good luck. In 'Braveheart', the suffering icon Gibson plays is William Wallace, who fights to liberate the Scots from the tyranny of their English rulers and the treachery of the Scottish Lords.Wallace matches cruelty with cruelty but that's alright because he's on the side of freedom. At least in 'Braveheart' the times and the enemy are more in tune with barbarous methods than that of 'The Patriot', which I detest as nothing more than a Revolutionary War-era 'Death Wish'. Patrick McGoohan is delicious as the English king Edward Longshanks who treats his allies as callously as his enemies. And I must admit my props to Mr. Gibson for treating warfare as the messy, horrific affair it is although he seems to revel in it.'Braveheart' has many pluses. It is very convincing in taking you back in time. The stark landscapes of the Scottish countryside are lovely.",8,2,4,18 November 2004
Donnie Darko," Unsentimental
","One aspect of 'Donnie Darko' I wish to comment on is writer/director Richard Kelly's unsentimental treatment of Donnie's mental illness.  Sure the audience is led to believe Donnie's visions have some validity but they are visions of a man in a skeletal rabbit costume who impels Donnie into destructive acts.  Jake Gyllenhaal appears to be channeling Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' when he is under the spell of Frank the Rabbit.  When his parents (wonderfully played by Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) learn the extent of his illness from Donnie's doctor, it is heartbreaking.  But they handle the news, and Donnie, with aplomb.And yet in spite of his problems, Donnie still manages to fit in high school - most of the time.  He participates in class discussion, he hangs out with his friends, he teases his little sister, he even finds a girl friend. Mental illness is a lonely condition.  What is Mr. Kelly's implication of the teenage condition?",8,0,0,14 June 2004
Princess Mononoke," Imaginative Animation
","The version I watched was the English dubbed.  All the actors did a fine job.  Only Billy Bob Thornton's voice was distracting because it was recognizable to me.The story's main theme is the familiar nature vs man. Actually there's a twist, nature vs woman and man.  Female characters wield a lot of power in this movie.The strength of the film is the animation.  The land was rendered lush and vibrant.  It made me pine for a planet covered in forest.  I thought the forest sprites were really cute.One oddity, the movie never explicitly states who the Princess is. Logically it must have been San but I couldn't confirm that until I visited IMDB.com.  Maybe it's just me.",7,0,2,2 February 2003
