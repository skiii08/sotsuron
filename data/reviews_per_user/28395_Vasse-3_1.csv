Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sellout
","This has got to be the worst letdown in history. Yar yar Binks is, yes annoying and although I know that I'm not the first one to say so it has to be stated. Annakin is annoying, not as in bad actor or his dialog, but as in ridiculous actions. He could probably take care of the entire empire at the age of ten. And what I feel is the worst is that it feels like Mr. Lucas threw in some eyecandy/cool scenes like the racing scene and the fighting scenes and just shut his eyes as hard as he could regarding the fact that the rest of the movie sucked infernally. That is exactly what Star Wars did not use to be about. But I do have to add that Darth Maul is damn cool and Miss Portman is equally cute. Hope he shapes up when making part two and three.",3,0,1,22 May 2000
