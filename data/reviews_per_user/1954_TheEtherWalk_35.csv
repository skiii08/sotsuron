The Expendables 2," Surprisingly... boring?
","Okay now I didn't expect this movie to have an Oscar-winning script or performances but I enjoyed the first film for what it was, a no-holds barred, fun action blockbuster. Expendables 2 is devoid of fun, and all the action is completely by-the-numbers and listless. Sylvester Stallone is a great action director. Simon West (Con Air, Tomb Raider) is not. I have no idea why Stallone decided not to direct this one but it was a huge mistake. The whole movie is pretty much just hundreds of braindead bad guys getting shot in repetitive fashion for 100 minutes. The first film had energy but this one just drags on and on. Even cameos by Willis, Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris are pretty much wasted. The climax of the film involves the team shooting up an airport and Statham and some second-in-command bad guy duking it out next to a plane with a giant propeller blade spinning right behind them. Hmm I wonder if someone is going to get chopped up in those blades? Predictable, predictable, predictable. And the final fight between Stallone and Van Damme is pointless and clichéd, but not enough to even be humorous. The movie actually takes itself too seriously sometimes. And something weird happens at the end. The team is all sitting around the aircraft celebrating, everyone except Yin Yang. Jet Li mysteriously vanishes halfway through the movie and never returns. Did he realize how pointless his involvement with this series was and just walked off the set? I mean he beats up people with frying pans in one scene. That's about the extent of his role. He's Jet Li, not freaking Samwise Gamgee. This whole movie is a huge waste of time.",5,3,6,4 February 2013
Se7en," Fincher does it again
","Seven is a movie about two detectives, played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who notice that their killer has been following a theme: the Seven Deadly Sins. Fincher turns an average premise into one of the best films of the nineties, an engrossing, fascinating and even apocalyptic thriller. There are some great ideas about human nature, and while it doesn't go as deep as Fight Club, the ending is a shocker. Kevin Spacey shows up during the last half hour to give another great performance, and even R. Lee Ermey features in some scenes. Highly recommended. 9/10",9,0,0,18 September 2004
The Big Lebowski," Funny nonsense
","This movie is hilarious but it's difficult to put into words. There is no summary that can be made that would be less than a page. The plot twists all over with subplots ranging from a soiled rug to a porn tycoon to a kidnapping case and on and on... one reviewer put it the best when he called it 'a two hour Seinfeld episode: a movie about nothing.'Aside from the ridiculously confusing plot (i had to watch it 3 times before I understood it all), the characters are what hold this movie together. Hilarious performances by John Goodman, John Turturro and others make this well worth the headaches. 9/10",10,1,2,27 January 2004
Inglourious Basterds," Absolutely spectacular
","'Watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.' - Aldo RaineTarantino returns with his first film since the slightly underrated Death Proof, in one of the most entertaining and stylish movies of 2009. Brad Pitt stars as the leader of the Nazi-hunting Basterds, Christoph Waltz as a sadistic Nazi colonel, and Mélanie Laurent as a vengeful Jewish cinema owner. It is a story about revenge, dishonor and tragic circumstance.The plot is slightly unconventional, in that many scenes are 20-plus minutes long, and there is a lot of dialogue. The pacing is consistent however, and the incredible tension created in each of the scenes means that it never gets dull for a moment. The film is blood-soaked but only in short bursts, and the shock of the violence is higher as a result. The cinematography is beautiful, as is the costume design. The film is shot in a very classical style and doesn't go over the top like some Tarantino films. It never feels like a Taratino film, which shows that he has grown as a filmmaker.The script is incendiary, going hand in hand with the long style editing to create excellent character arcs (some of which only last one scene.) The performances, particularly by Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent, are totally unforgettable. If Laurent doesn't become huge after this movie, it will be a shame. Brad Pitt is the all-American hero, and though his role is more one-note than the other characters, he has some great lines and was very enjoyable to watch. The supporting cast has some surprises, like Mike Myers nearly unrecognizable as an Allied general, and Julie Dreyfus as the girlfriend of German filmmaker Goebelles, who both make the most out of smaller roles. Daniel Brühl also impresses in his screen debut, as a German war hero.The plot is centered around the showing of a German war film at a small cinema in Paris, and the film within a film is about a German war hero who killed hundreds of Allied soldiers from the top of a tower. The German high command has showed up to view the film, and both the Basterds, a group of Nazi-killing assassins, and the cinema's owner, Shosanna, plan to take out the whole German leadership during the screening. The film is almost nauseatingly violent, but there is a method to Tarantino's madness.The film may seem grossly jingoistic at first glance, but I think Tarantino is really trying to say something about the nature of violent imagery. Near the end, Hitler is laughing watching American soldiers die in a Nazi propaganda film. Then, in what has to be one of the most outrageous scenes in cinema history...*SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*Eli Roth and Omar Doom burst in and mow down Hitler and Goebbels with machine guns.*SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*Has Tarantino finally lost his mind? Not quite. He's created an alternate history of the end of World War 2, one that we have all pictured in our minds at some point. My personal reaction to this scene was to immediately cheer and clap. Then I realized Tarantino had gotten me. Unbelievably, I actually felt a little sorry for Hitler. I mean, he gets shot to pieces and then shot some more. Leave it to Tarantino to make me feel guilty for laughing at Hitler's death.My initial reaction proved the point he was trying to make with this movie. Just like Hitler is amused by the death of American soldiers in the film-in-a-film, we in turn laugh when a bunch of Nazis are mowed down. It seems perfectly natural to laugh at such brutality, because this is a fantasy: We would all like to see Hitler die horribly. But Tarantino is testing the audience. It should be shocking, not funny. Tarantino has brought to light one of the most overlooked double standards in film: Aren't American-centered war movies no better than propaganda, and have we been conditioned to view the killing of Germans as entertaining?By using Jews to kill the Nazis, he is doing a spin on the adage 'Before seeking revenge first dig two graves'. They end up becoming no better than butchers, killing honorable people in the name of revenge. Most of the Jewish characters end up dying at the end, giving a literal meaning to the expression. In the first scalping scene, Eli Roth's character is reluctant to kill the German officer because he knows it's morally wrong. An image of him blasting a dead man's face to pulp with a tommy gun with fire in his eyes shows us what kind of person he has become by the end.On the surface this film seems simple, but Tarantino has loaded it with philosophical questions. This is not a typical war film, but really a satire of them. Tarantino should be commended for making such an entertaining (which should make the viewer feel guilty, and did for me), shocking, well made and unique motion picture. Stylistically, it's such a throwback to classic film noir that we will likely never see a film like it again. It's so well made that most of it's excesses can be overlooked, and I think it deserves multiple Oscar nominations.One final note, I didn't feel guilty laughing about the fate of the slimy Hans Landa, who gets exactly what he deserves at the end. In the opening scene he professes his love of rats, and like a rat he sells out the Nazis to save his own skin. In the end, his betrayal saves his life, but it's no longer a life worth living. Likewise, the French farm owner has to live with the knowledge that he let a Jewish family die. I guess it is better to die honorably than live dishonorably.",10,0,7,7 December 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," The JJ Abrams syndrome
","Everything this man does has the same problems. He simply has no idea how to properly tell a story. He just comes up with some ridiculously complicated plots that somehow seem to go absolutely nowhere and then simply end. He has no finesse for pacing and his obnoxious multi-million dollar CGI visual style doesn't suit Star Trek at all. I'm worried to see what he'll do with Star Wars... This movie simply has nothing going for it apart from some pretty visuals and a nicely menacing performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. Just like with Super 8, the character development sucks, the plot line is stupid and the ending just made me go 'Seriously? That's it?' Up until that point it was okay. I liked the plot of the people in the missiles and the attack on the Klingon. It was a bit confusing but I think it made sense. However some of the techonological aspects of the film are really silly. For one thing, the Enterprise is seen taking massive amounts of damage even though the shields are still up. Scotty somehow disables their weapons from within the bowels of the ship, and not only does nobody go down there to try to turn them back on, nobody really does anything. It's a huge plot convieniency when the Enterprise is always seconds away from being annihilated, and then the enemy's weapons get disabled. This happens twice in a row. The missile detonation inside the Admiral's ship just happens to destroy their weapons. Then the whole Kirk sacrificing himself in the reactor thing was supposed to be moving but since you know he's probably going to get resurrected pretty quickly (Hint: Khan's blood can resurrect people') there's no emotional weight to it whatsoever. Also how did the warp core get out of alignment anyways? And how did Khan's ship only start falling from the sky AFTER the Enterprise was saved? And why crash the ship and take off on foot to attack Starfleet command? (Which would have been cool but never ended up happening.) Why not crash the ship and initiate a warp core breach to destroy basically the whole city? That would have been cool. The movie should definitely have been longer and had more gravity in it's climax. Instead we get Spock chasing Khan for about 10 minutes, Uhura stuns him, and Spock somehow knocks him out with an uppercut even though he's basically invulnerable. Khan gets frozen and stowed away somewhere. Kirk gets resurrected and they fly off into space. LAME. I want to see more of Khan!!! KHAAAAAAAAAAAANNN!!!! Oh yeah that line made the reactor scene that much lamer.",3,1,2,18 November 2013
Public Enemies," Good performances, mediocre script
","Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger on the run from law enforcement, led by Melvin Purvis played by Christian Bale. Let's start with the good. The action scenes are intense and gripping, and Depp is a powerhouse throughout the film. I really feel like they developed the character of Dillinger very well. I also liked Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup and Stephen Graham as Baby Face Nelson. There is also great cinematography, costume design and editing. For all it's technical excellence, the film has a lot of problems.The script is NOT based on historical facts, apart from a few key scenes involving Dillinger escaping, and finally meeting his end. The Wikipedia page for this movie lists all the changes made, I suppose to make the film more cinematic. But in this case it really ends up working against the film. It feels too romanticized at times. Depp is essentially the hero, and is portrayed as basically a good guy who just likes robbing banks. The film is lacking in grit as a result.Most of Dillinger's associates are poorly developed and get killed all in one scene to make the movie more exciting. Although it is exciting, it's not dramatic or believable. And if historical accuracy isn't their top priority, they could have made some of the robbery scenes more exciting. Another problem is the whole angle of the mob hating Dillinger for forcing the creation of new laws against organized crime. This plot line went absolutely nowhere and should have been left out. On another note, I'm not sure if it was the actor's delivery or the sound design, but it was really hard to understand what people were saying in some scenes. Not that any of the dialogue really matters, and a lot of scenes amount to absolutely nothing. Mann is going strictly for style over substance here.Another place the script fails is in the character played by Christian Bale. Purvis is no Al Pacino in Heat. In fact, I can't think of one thing his character actually did besides shoot a few people. To cast an actor like Bale in a role that has almost no character development is a problem. The should have either cast a lesser known actor or rewritten his role entirely. In real life Purvis wasn't very involved with most of the events he's portrayed in, so casting him as a main player was folly unless they gave him more back story. As a result, the only real dramatic weight is between Depp and Cotillard, which was done very well.Strongly acted but lacking in accessibility, Public Enemies is a frustrating film. Certainly not Mann's best film, but not his worst either. In the end, this movie is pure entertainment and nothing more.",6,0,1,5 December 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Epic Fail: the Movie
","Where to begin with this one. Problems are numerous, including spotty acting, effects, and cinematography. I'm going to focus on the script for this review as it really looks like the writers wrote up a bunch of plot points, characters and trailer-ready fight sequences, and then tried to write a movie around them. The result is nothing short of disastrous.For a movie that is supposed to give the origins of Wolverine, they did a good job of telling us exactly nothing about WHO Wolverine is. It's like they assume we know everything about the characters already, so there's no need to develop anyone's character. A movie should stand on its own. Origins: Wolverine is a one-legged dog.Liev Schreiber and Hugh Jackman both do well in their roles, but the first 10 minutes of the movie are rushed and underdeveloped. It's too fast-paced, and the result is painfully uninvolving. They spend about 3 minutes as kids, in which we find out practically nothing about them. Then it literally cuts from them being kids running through the woods to them shooting people in the Civil War. The opening credits montage takes us through 150 years in about 3 minutes, and suggests that Logan is tired of being in wars and Victor loves it. This is all the information we get about who they are. By the time they're recruited by Stryker, they have interacted with each other approximately twice. Why do they join every single American war? Do they just like getting shot a lot? Why is Victor so bloodthirsty and Logan good? How did Logan and Kayla meet? How did Logan find out he was invincible? Does he feel anything about the fact that he killed his father? The filmmakers didn't care. This movie has all the depth of a piece of cardboard.Victor's motivations are beyond murky throughout the whole film. He basically goes around killing characters for no real reason at all. Logan's relationship with his girlfriend starts out very poorly developed and actually becomes LESS believable by the end of the movie. In the one scene that is supposed to develop Logan and Kayla's relationship, she starts talking about some weird symbolic moon myths... its unintentionally hilarious. Oh, and it turns out she's a mutant and is hypnotizing Logan in order to watch him for Stryker, and fakes her death in order to make Logan to want revenge on Victor to force him into the Weapon X program so they could test the adamantium on him for the Deadpool project and then erase his memory in order to rescue her sister from Stryker. Seriously. But she really loves him! Uh-huh. They conveniently leave out how Logan and Kayla met, which at first seems like just lousy character development, but then you realizethat they skipped over this so that they wouldn't have to explain the exact circumstances of their meeting with her secretly spying on him. I suppose it was just too darn hard to for these guys to write. Lynn Collins is completely wooden, and I didn't care one iota for her character.The lack of any believable characters leaves the movie plot-driven. But there's so many holes in the story that it's not even worth trying to find them all. This movie is basically a series of scenes, with very little connecting each one except Hugh Jackman's best efforts. Wolverine gets his jacket. Check. Wolverine gets his dog-tags. Check. Wolverines bone spikes somehow become giant knives when he gets his adamantium. The plot is not only convoluted and full of holes, but it completely negates itself in the last 10 minutes. Since Kayla ends up being alive, any tension created by the revenge scenario is totally wasted, and suddenly Victor is a good guy!? Everything was apparently done to create the super-mutant Deadpool (who doesn't have one single element of the comics Deadpool, except the name) who lasts about 10 minutes before dying by Logan's claws. That's the plot. Even though I know hardly anything about the comics, this is awful storytelling.All of Stryker's team are pointless, Dominic Monaghan is totally wasted, Ryan Reynolds disappears after the first 10 minutes and never returns, and the team's individual powers are never explained at all. Kevin Durand can put his fist in a tank's main gun and stop a shell, and then he becomes grotesquely fat. Will I Am (what kind of name is this?), whose character is apparently named Wraith, is basically a rip-off of Nightcrawler. Gambit is just in this for the fanboys and doesn't even have the right accent. There's a guy who can do gun-kata. Wow, I didn't know shooting people like the guy in Equilibrium was a mutant ability! Cyclops shows up for very little reason but to give Deadpool cool eye beams. All of these characters are mere plot points, moving Logan from place to place and then dying or disappearing. It would be predictable if it weren't so unbelievably bad.And the fights? Most are pretty short, inconsequential and bloodless. That's right, the savage Wolverine hardly doles out any real violence, only to his brother and to Deadpool, and since both have regeneration, and we know Victor and Logan will live, even the stabs have no stab. The cinematography and editing are pretty lousy. Remember the fight between Logan and Sabretooth from the first movie, on top of the Statue of Liberty? Or the White House attack with Nightcrawler from the second? There's no great techniques like those here, most of it is flat green-screening or total CGI shots. Some of the sets looks pretty cheap. Even the teleportation effects got worse in this one. The CGI is passable but not very realistic. All in all decidedly average visuals.What's left at the end of all this is a movie with hardly any drive, substance or value. I'm disappointed that this was the best they could do with such great potential.",1,58,100,2 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," I liked it a lot
","I'll keep this short. This movie had a great story, great action and was really well made. Sam Worthington really does a great job, even in the scene where he looks at the sky, puts his hands up and screams. That's how you do it, Gavin Hood. My only real complaint is that this movie didn't show much of the overall conflict between machines and humans, and hopefully the next one will be bloodier. Some parts of the plot seem slightly implausible as well, but this is offset by surprisingly good dialog. The action is all great looking, realistic and works seamlessly into the story. This isn't up to the level of the Batman reboots, but it's a very enjoyable movie.",8,2,4,27 May 2009
Bohemian Rhapsody," A triumph. One of the best films of the year
","Critics are wrong on literally everything they nitpick on. The historical changes are fine as well as the 'sanitization' of Freddie's life. It's a sign of respect on the part of the filmmakers that they didn't make this a cautionary tale, a story of gratuitous sex and drug use, or a film focussing entirely on AIDS. Everything in the film serves the development of Freddie and his journey to find happiness and find his true self... even at the expense of true history, the story told here is a masterful TRIBUTE to the trials and tribulations of his life, with all the pomp and drama that HE HIMSELF WAS INTO. People complain that the story was dramatized but I think Freddie would have loved it. This movie is not only about Freddie, it's FOR Freddie. Rami Malek gives the performance of a lifetime. Every nuance is perfectly practised and he gives the character a deep inner life even when he's not saying anything. A good example is the scene where he gets the biggest room in their bed and breakfast at the expense of everyone else, and he looks out a window and seems lost even in the midst of success. He turns to writing and through his musical writings you can feel the conflict in him between trying to reach his dreams and trying to stay a good person... the story of him finding his sexuality is perfectly executed... the musical journey of the band is excellent if quite shortened for time constraints... the concert setpieces send chills up the spine... the comraderie between the bandmates gives for tons of laughs and is endlessly endearing... just see the film already and give Malek the damned Oscar already",10,3,5,21 November 2018
Watchmen," A truly amazing, challenging work of art
","Watchmen is a truly excellent movie on almost every level, from character development, to political and social commentary, and it's as visually amazing as it is thoughtful and moving. Any movie that can hold one's attention for 2 1/2 to 3 hours without becoming boring for one second... now that is something truly special. I was constantly engrossed and almost every scene has something edifying and thought-provoking, both in dialogue and in subtext. There are many layers and each has a purpose in the end, making for a near-perfect screenplay.The cast all shine in their roles. Some people say Malin Akerman can't act, but I think she did a pretty good job in this movie. Jackie Earle Haley is perfect as Rorschach, being both menacing and darkly funny. I also loved Matthew Goode as Ozymandius, who is in many ways the tragic hero of the story. Jeffrey Dean Morgan has less screen time than the rest of the cast, but succeeds greatly in bringing to life the complexities of the Comedian. The plot is too complicated to go into, but every character is developed very well, each with their own flaws and moral ambiguity. The scenes added to the Ultimate Cut DVD also flesh out more the characters of Hollis Mason and Sally Jupiter, and the animated Tales of the Black Freighter is both frightening and symbolic, and gives a whole new angle to the inner thought process of the film.Ideas like moral relativism and objectivism, determinism and nihilism are explored in a really interesting way in the development of the characters. On an entirely different level, the story is a commentary on utilitarianism and deontology. (If you don't understand these terms, I'd suggest a quick trip to Wikipedia.) The philosophical nature of the story makes it less action based and more of a character piece. It works because it has brains and heart and doesn't try to be a typical Hollywood comic book movie. The story is dense and if you can't digest it all the first time around, multiple viewings will be very rewarding.The fight scenes are fantastic, and the whole film is incredibly cinematic. The computer visuals aren't perfect but they are amazing to look at, along with the cinematography inspired directly by the graphic novel. Zack Snyder's sense of style doesn't go into CGI overload like Sin City or even 300, but keeps things fairly realistic and balanced. They also use a very unique color palette that brings a natural mood to the sets, like a perfect mixture of reality and fantasy. There is a lot of slo-mo but it all works to add tension to the fight scenes. The soundtrack is great as well, with classics like The Sound of Silence and 99 Red Balloons making each scene resonate as if the film had a beating heart.Sometimes good isn't good, and evil isn't evil. Passion and judgement can be destructive, and maybe having enemies keeps us sane. Goodness can come out of chaos, and failure can be victory. The ends may justify the means, but only if you believe that there is an 'end'. I love this film because there's so many messages and so much to think about, that you can watch it again and again and see new things each time. And most importantly, I understood it without knowing much about the comics.I recently read the comic, and although the film is just slightly less thought-provoking, Snyder did an incredibly faithful job of adapting the characters, themes and settings into a concise but still deep package. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job with this material.",9,0,4,16 November 2009
Armageddon," Only so-so movie, but the FX are great!
","The movie Armageddon is typical Jerry Bruckheimer fare. It combines a massive budget and plenty of special effects with an average script and semi-serious plot.Where do I begin? Armageddon is a lopsided movie. The premise is that an asteroid the size of Texas (?) is headed for earth and a team of oil drillers are employed to stop it. The movie sounds serious, but it is really a comedy.Most of the asteroid scene is an error because the only things they would be able to hear is each other's voices. There are too many sound effects on the asteroid to make it believable.The best parts of this movie are the visual effects which were outstanding and Steve Buscemi who provides comic relief as the hilarious Rockhound. The beginning scene in NYC is quite well done, but after that the plot seems to go downhill. How is it that the guys on the oil rig have not heard about the disaster in NY? And don't even get me started on the whole nuke-on-the-surface-wouldn't-work thing, because it probably would. That scene on the Russian space station was so far-fetched that it blows my mind. But again, that's most Jerry Bruckheimer movies.Then there is that whole manual-detonate thing at the end. Why didn't NASA think of that in the first place, rather than trying to detonate the bomb on the surface, killing the whole crew? This was a weak way to add drama to the script.The dialogue is funny in some parts, but in most scenes it is just stupid. That might have something to do with the fact that the movie had 9 WRITERS!!!Overall, I think people are too hard on judging this movie. People have given it 1 out of 4, and some people have given it 3 out of 4, but no one has given it 2 out of 4. So I will. I give it ** out of **** or 5/10.",4,1,2,17 November 2002
American Psycho," This is American Psycho. Great great movie, a personal favorite.
","American Psycho is the story of a 20-something 1980s Wall Street exec named Patrick Bateman. He has all the money he could ever want, a beautiful fiancée, a huge apartment, and more. His lifestyle consists of getting reservations at the best restaurants, doing cocaine, working out, cheating on his fiancée with her best friend as well as several prostitutes, renting porno tapes and killing people. (He also never seems to do an ounce of work at whatever it is he does.) He doesn't understand why he does the things he does, but below the surface are clues that make it a brilliant character study, as well as a darkly hilarious satire of yuppie culture. It is also technically brilliant, with great cinematography, set designs and musical score. Watch the chainsaw scene for a good example of all of these.Christian Bale IS Patrick Bateman. I can imagine no other actor in this role. Bateman is narcissistic perfectionist, obsessed with fashion, status and outdoing his co-workers down to the most minute details. There is a scene where he asks two women if they have ever heard of his company, and when they say no, a subtle little scowl forms on his face. This says volumes about his character, how he thinks himself as almost a god and anyone who makes him feel even remotely inadequate needs to be destroyed. Another great scene is where Patrick views a colleague's business card, which is better than his, and he appears to be sweating from every pore. If he can't be the best at everything, he starts to lose it. He is also unable to connect with people on an emotional level, and probably likes it that way. Willem Dafoe shows up as a detective investigating one of his murders, and when he pulls out a CD from Huey Lewis and the News, (one of Bateman's favorites, but more on that later) Bateman denies being a fan of them. He doesn't like making any kind of connection with other people. In fact, Bateman has lived this way for so long that he has forgotten how to feel. (It's also strongly hinted that he might be a latent homosexual who is in complete denial to himself, at least in my opinion.) When his mistress says 'Can we talk?' he replies 'You look beautiful. There's nothing else to say.' He looks on the rest of humanity with contempt, and kills simply because he can. He has nothing in common with them, so he wants to inflict his inner pain on them. This pain is created by his empty life that is void of any meaning. He's like a king looking down on a rabble of peasants. This story could be about anyone in a position of untouchable power. The depth of his character is remarkable, and there's loads of subtext in almost every scene that make you notice something different every time you see this film. And it is very re-watchable. The one person that sheds a light on what little humanity he has left is his secretary Jean, played by the beautiful Chloe Sevigny. He very nearly makes an emotional connection with her, and actually holds back on killing her. I think it's her innocence that saves her, because it makes her the one person who represents hope for Patrick.Few films are able to be both shocking and funny simultaneously, but there are several moments here of ingenious black comedy. The most memorable scene involves Jared Leto's character Paul Allen. Bateman gets him drunk and takes him back to his apartment, and in the living room there are newspapers all over the floor. Bateman starts talking about Huey Lewis and the News, all while putting on a raincoat and grabbing an axe behind Paul's back. While dancing to the song Hip To Be Square, he lunges at Paul with the axe, killing him and spraying blood all over himself and the previously placed newspapers. Absolutely brilliant.This movie is endlessly quotable, from top to bottom. The dry way the characters talk is both hilarious and pathetic. These are not sympathetic characters, but it is enjoyable to watch how they attempt to act like human beings. Who could forget lines like 'It's totally disease-free' or 'I'm in touch with humanity'. The brutal murders are almost an afterthought to the brilliantly crafted world of Patrick's psyche.If there is a complaint to be made about this movie, it's that it could easily be 10 minutes longer. Some brilliant sections of the book have been omitted, including some surreal and hallucinatory scenes and some hilarious lines that would have brought this to the level of a masterpiece. Maybe Harron plays it a little too safe and should have let the story run wild and unhinged. Having said this, every scene taken from the book is adapted faithfully and the things that have been added make the story better.In 2000, who could have seen a movie like this coming? This could easily have been overlooked entirely, but as it stands today American Psycho is a cult classic. It is endlessly rewatchable, from the multiple psychological layers, to the hilarious dialogue, to the performance of a lifetime by Bale. There has never been a movie like this and there probably never will be.This review has meant nothing... this movie is not an exit.",10,1,2,7 January 2010
Knowing," Brilliant, BUT...
","Knowing is a terrific film by the director of Dark City that combines bone-chilling horror with a great story and amazing visuals. There is a feeling of sheer dread throughout, especially if you know how it's going to end. I had to keep telling myself it was only a movie. The musical score is excellent and really accentuates the terror and emotional impact of the whole movie. Nicolas Cage pulls off one of his best performances in years, and even though a lot of what he does ends up being futile, I really felt for all the characters. It seems a lot of the problems people had with the movie had to do with the plot, and while it's not flawless it's still really well told. Alex Proyas is known for being a stylistic director, and for this reason you should probably watch this with a certain frame of mind. Try to feel your way through the movie instead of over-thinking every little detail. It's an emotional roller-coaster ride and one of the best movies of 2009 so far. On top of everything, the action scenes are awesome.EDIT: Upon further review, my opinion has changed about this movie. I still think it's really well made, but I have to comment on the weird symbolisms and imagery used in the movie. For example, the rabbits may seem out of place until you realize that rabbits were sacred to the religion of Baal, a solar deity. This and other things in the film are related to kabbalism and occultism. If you believe in the Illuminati, you know that they control Hollywood and put their symbols in many films, for example the Nick Cage movies National Treasure 1 and 2. This movie may be part of a broader agenda by very sick and dangerous people. Their final goal is to sacrifice all of humanity to their solar deity who they still worship. You may not believe it but its symbolized everywhere. So enjoy the movie but understand what these things mean.",7,0,1,21 April 2009
Wanted," Pretty bad
","So, you probably heard that Wanted was a pretty decent movie. Well, I'm here to tell you, you heard wrong. This is a movie wallowing in its own absurdity and nihilism.McAvoy puts on a fairly decent lead performance. When the movie starts his character is a loserly desk jockey whose girlfriend is cheating on him, and he gets yelled at by his annoying boss. These scenes are funny but a little clichéd. As soon as he becomes an assassin, he stops being a loser. Hmm...The term suspension of disbelief is just begging to be used here. OK, so they expect the audience to believe the following: That certain people can slow down time by sheer adrenaline, that you can bend bullets while in this slowdown, and that you can defy every law of physics while in this state. Taking this as a comic book fantasy, I'm willing to look the other way to a point. But there's things that happen in this movie that are beyond impossible, like shooting a bullet through a can, a donut, a train, and into a guy's head from 50 miles away.The way the assassins get their missions is also completely ridiculous. Somehow a giant weave makes a code kind of like the viking Norns, and gives a name of a person to be killed. Why are they being killed? It's not important. The assassinations take on a sadistic quality and at no point did I care about any of it. Even more sadistic is the fraternity itself, who constantly beat the living daylights out of each other like some kind of Fight Club, then heal themselves with some mysterious waxy substance. All of the fraternity characters save one are poorly developed, and I have to say Angelina Jolie is miscast. She has the looks for the role but not the range. She just didn't fit the character.The last 30 minutes or so of this movie need special mention. There will be spoilers aplenty here, so be warned. There is a big train crash scene where about 200 people die, but the only important thing is that McAvoy kills his target who turns out to be his real father, and then somehow he survives a 500 foot drop into a river. He gets rescued by Terence Stamp of all people, in a surprisingly decent expositional role. Apparently the fraternity isn't the real fraternity, and Morgan Freeman was killing people for profit. How exactly does that make him a profit? Anyways, everyone at the fraternity had been targeted by the almighty spool of thread, and are therefore evil. So McAvoy busts in and brutally kills all his friends, Angelina Jolie kills herself and Morgan Freeman escapes, only to be killed later. Did I mention that this movie is really, really upbeat?One of my biggest problems with this movie is that it's predictable. Everyone who seems evil actually is. You know they have to end with a big action scene, so at some point the fraternity have to become the bad guys. It sort of evens itself out by making every underdeveloped guy evil, but simply by the tone of the movie you know how it has to end. Oh and apparently mice can drink gasoline without dying and become walking time bombs. Seriously.There's a couple of decent action scenes in this movie, and the script has its moments but overall this movie is bad to it's core. It's sheer ludicrousness and nihilism make it not worth the time.",3,2,6,9 October 2009
The Patriot," Braveheart Redux: Mel kills some more evil Brits!

Being John Malkovich," **
","This movie is highly imaginative and sometimes surreal. It is good in spots and horrible in others. There is something called suspension of disbelief, and this movie really pushes it.As a few other commentators pointed out, the first 1/2 of the movie is very funny and enjoyable. However, there is a section about half an hour long where John Cusack is absent. This ruined the film! He was the strongest character and suddenly we're stuck with John Malkovich. John has undergone a major character change which I HATED and could not accept. It's so ridiculous and so awkward that the movie stops being funny and is suddenly a horrifying mess. There is a lot of plot holes and a lot unanswered at the end. It was almost worth it, but there is a lot that doesn't really make sense. The ending is a huge downer because the main character gets left with nothing. A reluctant 6/10 because I really wanted to like it.",6,0,1,16 March 2004
Spider-Man," Good, but not THAT good
","I liked this movie. It is extremely accurate with respect to the comics and tv shows. But there is something about it that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it is Tobey Maguire, who was good as Spiderman but awful as Peter Parker. He needed to show more emotion. Or maybe it is the suits which looked WAY too cgi for some reason. Green Goblin's suit was messed up looking. Or perhaps it was Spiderman's webshooters that just appeared on his arms instead of him having to build them. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. I just think it is a little bit overrated. It needs some tweaking, so I'll give it 7/10.",4,3,7,18 November 2002
American History X," One of my top 10, stunning and tragic.
","American History X is the story of a man who succumbed to hatred and his journey to redemption. Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as Derek Vinyard, a skinhead jailed for murdering two black men. When he is released from jail he tries to get away from his old life and help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, to understand what happened to him. The film covers racism from nearly every angle and really makes you think. The narrative structure is a bit twisted though, and a lot of it is just flashbacks explaining how Derek came to be a skinhead, what happened to him in jail, etc. It's interesting to see how his hatred tears apart his family and hurts those around him. The ending is like a punch to the gut, but it really sums up what the characters have learned and the consequences of their actions. Totally brilliant, required viewing. 10/10",10,0,0,1 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Interesting premise, but ultimately left me a little sick to my stomach
","Aston Kutcher stars in the surprisingly violent Butterfly Effect, a movie that borrows from Donnie Darko, The Sixth Sense, and even American History X. Aston Kutcher has the inexplicable power to go back in time by reading his journal entries, and change events. But every time he does so, he hurts someone else. This film carries some emotional depth, but Kutcher seems out of his league. After watching it, I was reminded of the movie Bedazzled with Brendan Fraser, which suffers from the same problems. The problem is that by showing us all these possible futures, it's too much of an information overload. Also, you don't really get to know the characters because they change so many times. There are some interesting elements, but i ultimately detested this movie. It was derivative, nauseating and overdone. 4/10",4,3,7,6 September 2004
District 9," How to make a great action movie with a relatively small budget
","District 9 takes place in South Africa, and the story centers around a government worker assigned to help relocate the first aliens to ever land on Earth. The massive ship they came in has broken down, and they have nowhere to go. The aliens live in the giant shanty town of District 9 and live off of garbage; clearly they are undignified creatures. But they are not stupid. They have advanced weaponry that only they can use, because it responds only to alien DNA.The main character, Wikus, played by the excellent Sharlto Copley, becomes infected by a strange liquid while inspecting an alien dwelling, and begins a hideous transformation. Now having partial alien DNA, he has to hide from the government goons who want to sell his parts for astronomical amounts of money, as well as local gangs who want him for his ability to use the aliens weapons.The story is highly original and quite compelling. Wikus is a guy you can cheer for the whole way through, and his character is developed brilliantly. He sort of reminded me of Lionel from Braindead: a quiet, dorkish man who ends up becoming a total badass through sheer determination to live. On a side note, Jed Brophy (Void from Braindead) makes an appearance in the film, although I'm not quite sure when. Having Peter Jackson as producer clearly helped the film immensely, and his WETA digital team helped make amazing CGI shots for a budget of only $30 million. Take that, Michael Bay!One of the aliens becomes a main character partway through the movie, and maybe it was just me, but it was hard to care about a hideous CGI prawn alien and his son, probably because it's hard for their personalities to come through the tentacles and whatnot. As a result, the story of him and his son trying to return to the mother-ship ends up being the weakest part of the movie for me, and the story gets slightly overpowered by the visuals. This is a minor complaint however, and the strong social themes throughout the film make it a fairly edifying experience.The trailer made this look like a small budget sci-fi film with a little bit of action. Let me tell you, this movie has bigger and better action than most movies with 3 times the budget. The last half hour is a gory, bullet riddled extravaganza like nothing you've ever seen. The cinematography is brilliant, putting the viewer right in the middle of the action, and the visual effects of the weaponry, the ships, and an amazing, near-indestructible mech suit are nothing short of mind blowing.There will no doubt be a sequel to this, as the ending leaves many things open. Although it is not quite a masterpiece, District 9 is one of the most entertaining and unique films of the year.",9,1,5,18 December 2009
Saving Private Ryan," Kick @$$ Movie
","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)I cannot begin to say how much I loved this movie. Probably the most engrossing plot line of any war movie. I liked the story, especially at the end because the end really makes the film what it is, which is amazing. The entire point of the movie is summed up in one line: 'Tell me I've lived a good life.' Ryan wants to have lived a good life because almost a whole squad died to bring him home. This is the genius of the movie, because the mission is so deadly, just for saving one man.The end battle is brutally violent. One guy gets stabbed slowly through the heart, a couple are blown up, and just about everyone else gets shot. The few that are left at the end are in hysteria. This movie does an excellent job of proving just how insane war can be, because they sacrificed so many people just to save one.",10,0,0,15 November 2002
Mulholland Drive," The most terrifying movie ever made
","David Lynch's films are like abstract paintings. They may look simple on the surface, but the more you look, the more they seem to have eerie meanings behind them, told in alien tongues and perhaps wholly unsolvable. Mulholland drives begins with two women, an actress played by Naomi Watts, and a woman who loses her memory in a car crash and winds up needing the other's help, played by Laura Harring. Together they try to piece together who she is, and things start to get stranger as the characters try to unravel a mystery beyond comprehension. Justin Theroux shows up as a young director whose life begins to fall apart after he makes a casting decision against the wills of some very strange men who drink expensive coffee. His sections of the film give some comic relief, even though he is trapped in the same inexplicable nightmare as the women. The plot itself isn't really important to follow, and since it is quite confusing and fragmented, you can simply let the experience of the film wash over you without worrying about understanding it as you would a normal story.Despite it's surreal overtones and disjointed structure, this movie has some great insights into the (un)realities of Hollywood. It is both a homage to film noir and a cautionary tale of fame and jealousy. Betty (Watts) is a young up and coming actress who seems to have her whole life ahead of her, and a golden glow around her head. Lynch uses an interesting technique when she is first introduced, by dubbing all the lines in ADR. This has the effect of making the acting seem horrible, but there's a purpose. The scene is unreal in it's bright happiness, and the two people she is with continue to smile unnaturally when they leave. Without giving too much away, Betty's persona evolves over the course of the film, and really lets Naomi Watts show a great range of emotions, from purposefully naive to broken and haggard. When Betty goes to an audition, and acts brilliantly, the difference between her acting and her real persona is staggering, and shows you how good of a performance it really is by Watts. The audition scene also shows how fantasy becomes her reality, and this has parallels across the entire film. Nothing is truly what it seems, and the seemingly innocent relationship between the two women starts to drift into darker territory as reality steadily seeps through. When the truth is finally revealed, you will realize that Mulholland Drive has taken you from naive bliss straight to the horrors of Hell.Lynch is a master of subtle film-making. Instead of using music in some scenes, he uses low-pitched background noises. He used these in Eraserhead as well, and they are a great way of making an atmosphere of anxious tension. However the musical score by Angelo Badalamenti is spellbinding. The cinematography is brilliant as well, using blur effects, first-person perspectives and strange close-ups to draw you right into the movie. One scene in particular draws the viewer's attention because at first it seems to be completely removed from the main storyline, and it is. But since Lynch does nothing by accident, this means it is the most important scene in the movie. (In an interview he refers to this type of scene as the 'duck's eye'.) A man tells his friend that he had a dream about this restaurant, and that there's a man waiting behind it, a creature of sheer horror. So they go outside to see if the man is there. Just like there may be a man behind the diner, there is a presence, an ineffable malevolent force lurking behind every frame, word and scene of this movie. I know of no other film able to create such a profound uneasiness, as if some otherworldly revelation were near at hand.The film is also visually stunning, with the colour blue mysteriously permeating many scenes, and the set designs and dialogue containing little clues throughout the film. The mystery is as compelling as it is chilling. Even though there may be no answer to what's really going on in the movie, you will want to watch it more than once to figure out all the different layers, and they are mostly cohesive if you look at it right. Some say it is just a dream and reality juxtaposed, but it's so much more than that. There is another whole layer of inexplicable, subconscious terror permeating the film, and just when you think you have it all figured out, the last scene explodes like a final question in an impossible riddle. Mulholland Drive is a fully realized world of harrowing suspense and dreamlike unreality. There are moments in this film that are so psychologically affecting that they will never leave your mind, and it's final images will leave you shellshocked. Overall it is a roller-coaster of emotions and an endlessly intriguing puzzle. Lynch's storied career may well have hit it's peak with this, an absolute masterpiece.",10,2,3,4 February 2010
8 Mile," I liked it
","Eminem can act! Who'd have thought? 8 Mile is a great movie about a young man's struggles in suburban Detroit. (Please note: this is NOT Eminem playing himself. He even explains in the DVD that if he were playing himself, his character would have been very limited.) It involves a gang war between the 313 and the Free World gangs. The fight scenes are realistic, but nobody gets killed. And above all, at the end they settle things with words and not violence. Interesting.And I absolutely loved the rap battles, they were hilarious and filled with cold disses.The only thing I found to be out of place in this movie is Brittany Murphy's character. The mindless sex that her character brings to the movie offsets many things about it. The factory scene was in really bad taste too.Overall, 8/10. PS, I'm not a big fan of rap, but i loved this movie.",8,0,0,20 June 2003
Black Hawk Down," Not Bad
","Black Hawk Down has more graphic violence and action than I have ever seen. Although it lacks some of the heart of SPR or Platoon, it can hold it's own. Be thankful that Bruckheimer didn't totally mangle this movie like he did Armageddon. This is by far the best thing he has ever been involved in.Black Hawk Down has sick action and violence and is pretty entertaining for those who have already been desensetized to massive amounts of gore. I agree that the end where they list the 19 Americans who died was a little bit bad, but what did you want them to do? List all the 1000 somalis who died? How would they ever find out all their names? They didn't have to list any names I suppose, but at least they went to the trouble of honoring the Americans (as if they need any more of that). I suppose what they could have done was just put 'We also remember the 1000 Somalis, names unknown, who died bravely in this tragedy.'All in all though, a very entertaining and accurate depiction of one of the greatest blunders in US Military history. (The only war movie where the Americans actually lost and retreated, as far as I know) 9/10",7,0,0,26 December 2002
Mission: Impossible," Solid, intelligent spy thriller
","Mission: Impossible is a movie about a spy who must uncover a mole in his organization.I really liked this movie. It is extremely well written, and albeit a little confusing, but if you listen closely you should be able to follow it. It has an incredible amount of suspense and intrigue, and I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same formulaic Bond-type movies. The ending is probably my favorite in any movie, and is well worth sitting through some of the dialogue-based scenes. In the end, there is nothing NOT to like about this movie. If you find it confusing, you are probably USED to badly written movies. This movie was not written for audiences and is not meant to be easy to understand. It is more believable that way, I think. 9/10",9,3,6,3 December 2002
Mama," You've seen it all before... a completely forgettable experience
","I'm absolutely astounded by the amount of praise this film is getting from critics and audiences. Is this how far we've sunk as filmgoers that we accept whatever so-called horror is thrown our way even if it's a big pile of doo-doo? Mama is yet another jump-scare, cgi ridden, laughable cheese-fest just like so many other myriad 'horror' pictures that have come out in recent years. It's not even cheesy in a good way. There's good cheesy horror comedies out there that are done right, such as Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell. It knew that horror and comedy go perfectly together and worked as a result. Mama is cheesy in that it tries way too hard to be scary and it comes off as silly and amateurish, more of an unintentional comedy. Everyone in my theatre was laughing their heads off constantly. I don't think that was the intention.Granted this film isn't a complete disaster like Boogeyman or Darkness Falls but feels very reminiscent of both those films. Besides the awful CGI ghost, one of the biggest problems with Mama is the overuse of loud noises. Every time something is supposed to be scary, there's an extremely loud noise and usually something flies at the camera really quickly. But it failed to even raise a single hair on my arms or make me scared even for a second. The acting is passable and Jessica Chastain is hot but the plot is nosensical, predictable and has a twist at the end just for the sake of having one in an attempt to save this movie from being completely forgettable. Please folks, don't waste your hard-earned money on sub-par horror movies like this.If you want a ghost story that is actually well-made and scary, watch the Spanish film The Orphanage. Or wait for the Evil Dead remake in a few months. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell know that great horror isn't about cheap jump scares and by-the-numbers creepiness. Real horror has to get under your skin. It has to get into your head and make you question your own sanity. It has to spark some synapses in your brain and affect you on a subconscious level to truly be scary. See Mulholland Drive by David Lynch for a perfect example. Unfortunately, Mama did none of these things for me and just feels like yet another bargain bin 'horror' title. It's also overlong at 100 minutes and padded with repetitive scenes that add nothing to the film. This is Andrés Muschietti's debut as a feature film director and it shows. He fails to create anything original or worthwhile, simply borrowing from dozens of other horror flicks. 61% on Rotten Tomatoes? 6.6 on the IMDb? For shame.",3,10,25,29 January 2013
The Matrix Reloaded," Completely and utterly insane
","This movie not only expands on the original, it redefines how we think about this series. We take so much for granted in these movies, and when you realize what is really going on at the end of Reloaded, when it explains Neo's purpose, it will completely blow your mind.As for the action scenes, my favorite was when Morpheus pulls out the katana and the mother****ing uzi, I was like YES, and he just goes postal on those two ghost agents, it was great.If the original Matrix blew your mind, Reloaded will tear it to pieces.",7,0,0,23 May 2003
Con Air," Muddled, silly, cliched and ridiculous.
","I really wanted to like this movie, but i'm sorry to say it sucks. The plot is utter nonsense, with the obligatory subplots about The Men in Power (in this case it's Colm Meaney) trying to blow up The Bad Guys along with Our Main Hero and somebody tries to stop them. Doesn't this happen in every Bruckheimer movie? It's so cliched as to invoke nausea. Nic Cage's character is overstated as usual. First-time director Simon West is out of his element and would be better off doing comedies. The ending is exciting, but the villains final moments are so confusing and slapped-together that I didn't even know what happened to most of them. In a movie like this, the ending is important because there are so many villains to kill off. Very poorly done!",1,9,21,4 February 2004
Arrival," Expected a not for everyone, avante-garde, thinking man's sci-fi, surprisingly got one of the dumbest scripts in recent memory
","So this film does have some pluses. The acting, cinematography, pacing and editing are all pretty good. But it all gets sunk because the story makes absolutely no sense.How anyone can call this film a masterpiece is beyond me. The concept is interesting but the execution is clichéd, sappy and nonsensical. There are so many plot holes with the ending. I get that the power given to Amy Adams' character by the aliens is more or less retroactive, meaning that she had it all along because it's beyond time itself. So she's had visions of a daughter she hasn't had yet. She doesn't think this is the least bit odd? And she hasn't had visions of anything else like the aliens coming down, or Jeremy Renner being the father? That's convenient... there's a great many contrivances but the biggest problem I have with this film is that it suggests that a vision of the future can create itself out of nothing and the fact that you've seen it lets you make the exact choices needed to fulfill it. I'm talking specifically about the scene where she calls the Chinese general which is an absolute paradox. Precognition can't allow you to see futures that couldn't possibly exist. And how would precognition help humanity unite or help the aliens whatsoever? There are a great many examples in popular fiction that show that knowledge of the future can be a curse rather than a blessing. And who would get the powers? Would governments decide? Would rival countries use precognitive powers to wage war with each other? Imagine a whole world full of people who could all see the future, it would be chaos. Then there's the sappy melodrama, all the evil military guys pointing their guns at Amy Adams while she tries to save the poor aliens from being blown to smithereens, it just comes off as hugely clichéd that she's the only one doing the right thing while everyone else tries to hold her back, and by the way how did they know for sure they could even destroy the aliens? Wouldn't such an advanced race have some sort of defensive shielding? This is never mentioned. And what were they doing behind those glass walls for month anyhow? How were they sustaining themselves? And what is the lesson to be learned at the end of the film? Humans don't really learn to co-operate and communicate better. She simply uses the power to cheat humanity's way to better foreign relations. So not only is it a cheat towards ideas of precognition, it cheats the entire premise of the movie away. And then she learns that maybe changing the future isn't for the best and that she should let it happen even if she knows it will end in pain? Isn't that against the premise as well? And what does her future with her husband and kid have to do with anything anyhow except to create a needlessly emotional ending? And then there's Jeremy Renner's line at the end: 'Let's make a baby.' Seriously?? This movie is an enormously pretentious pile. Do not waste your time.",3,11,20,20 June 2017
Signs," Great movie, but not for everyone
","In the film Signs, an alien invasion is shown through the experiences of one family, who is struggling to cope with other tragedies.Everyone who said this movie is not about the Aliens is correct. It is about family, but also about faith and God, hence it will be forgotten by the majority of viewers. It certainly will not have universal appeal, as this style of movie is seen rarely if at all. It isn't another brainless Sci-Fi epic, but is more subtle and scaled-down. It think it works extremely well. The mood of the movie is very mysterious, but also sarcastic and funny at some points.I thought this was an excellent movie, but anyone looking for War of The Worlds type entertainment should look elsewhere.",6,0,1,25 January 2003
Identity," Fantastic thriller, with mind-blowing twists.
","John Cusack stars in this thriller about 10 people who become stranded at a motel in the middle of a storm. They begin to die one by one, and as the mystery unfolds, we are mislead to several conclusions, and although we may predict one twist, there are more which hit us like a freight trains. Nothing is what it seems. Bizarre occurrences are abundant, such as a scene where one character escapes the hotel but ends up in an exact mirror image of it. My jaw was on the floor, because the end was so completely unexpected. An absolute must-see. 10/10",10,2,4,31 October 2003
Casino," Career-best for all involved. The three hours will just fly by
","Scorsese's follow-up to Goodfellas is a monstrously entertaining drama about a mafia run casino in Vegas. Robert De Niro plays the chain-smoking control freak Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of the Tangiers casino by his mob buddies, most notably Nicky Santoro. Santoro is played by the one and only Joe Pesci, who may very well have topped his performance in Goodfellas. Nicky is a killer, thief, gambler, and muscle-man, who wants the world and is willing to go over the heads of his bosses to get it. Sharon Stone completes the trifecta of immorality as Ginger, a hustler who Sam convinces to marry him even though he knows she doesn't love him. Though the movie is largely the story of the mob embezzlement of Vegas, and the inner-workings, dynamics and politics of running a casino, the relationship between the three main characters is key to the plot.The plot is told unconventionally, and as the story takes place over the span of ten years, many of its scenes feel like anecdotes. But each one adds something great to the whole story. Everything builds to something, there's not one wasted second in the entire 3 hours. It seems to go by very quickly because it is so entertaining. The three leads are absolutely flawless and the drama that unfolds is truly engrossing. All three change as the movie progresses. Ginger starts off as a happy, free-spirited woman, but when she marries Sam she starts a descent into darkness. Sam's controlling tendencies are largely to blame for her slide into drug abuse, greed and compulsive lying. She resents him controlling her, he doesn't trust her enough to give her any space. She spirals further by running away with their kid and Lester, then later tying the kid to the bed when she went out to drink. Sam is the kind of person who tries to do the right thing in all situations, but with Ginger he sometimes overreacts and escalates problems further. Their deteriorating relationship threatens to sink the whole casino scam.Meanwhile Sam's over-protectiveness of his own casino lands him in hot water with the gaming commission, and Nicky's own actions make him a target for the FBI. Both are unable to let go of the monster that they created, Nicky refusing to leave town to let the heat on him cool down, and Sam unable to step out of the limelight of running the casino. The relationship between Nicky and Ginger is interesting because for once we see a human side of Nicky. She ends up sleeping with him, complicating things further. When the house of cards quite literally comes down, the bullets fly in classic Scorsese style. Only Sam is left unscathed, somehow coming full circle, hopefully a much wiser man.Scorsese directs this movie at full-speed, tearing open the rotten underside of Vegas in the 1970s for all to see. From taking us into the inner workings of casinos, to mob shakedowns, husband and wife quarrels, political manoeuvring, and tying it all together, you're always involved. This is a must-see film and one of the best of the 90's.",10,1,1,6 January 2009
Deadpool," A modern action-comedy classic
","This is the movie I've been waiting for for years. I have never picked up a Deadpool comic but I know the character, and I feel like he is just so relateable for me. He's super minus the hero. He's the everyman, a mutant free of the restrictions of morality, politeness, and other such pretentiousness. Wade Wilson starts off as a cocky type, and after becoming virtually unkillable, he becomes the cockiest, most asshole-ish let's annoy the hell out of everybody before killing them mercenary ever. He is juxtaposed perfectly in this film by Colossus, played here as a hilarious goody two-shoes, endlessly annoyed and disgusted by Deadpool's ways, and the charmingly deadpan and sarcastic Negasonic Teenage Warhead. And he faces off against a 200 pound sack of assholes called Ajax who is virtually unkillable as well. It's pretty typical sounding, but the execution is where this movie really hits home. Deadpool for days. God does this movie rule. Let's get down to brass tacks. The plot consists of his backstory and his mission of revenge against the people who turned him into a mutant. A former special forces soldier turned mercenary, he finds true love with a beautiful barfly named Vanessa. But soon their life together turns dark when he is diagnosed with cancer. Out of options, he turns to a shadowy organization with promises of not only health, but something beyond being human. It's here that things turn horrific, but it's only to further the plot really. The real draw of this movie is the comedy and hilariously raunchy one-liners from our hero. And his whole persona in general is so goofy and off the wall that he's impossible not to like. Ryan Reynolds owns this role inside and outside of the suit, almost every joke in this movie hits, only maybe one or two fall flat but this is a minor quibble.The odd thing is, with the offbeat type of humor that it has, this almost feels like a cult classic because of it's quotability, not unlike Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But this is the rare type of cult film that has actually scored HUGE at the box office as well. Maybe some people were expecting another typical Marvel movie, and boy were they wrong. This is something very different and definitely not for everyone. Personally I think this is one of the funniest films EVER MADE though. Zamboni guy? It's me Margaret? That Liam Neeson nightmare again? This screenplay is AMAZING. Maybe even Oscar worthy. The script is also full of heart and has the ability to SURPRISE. With so many comic book movies these days you know pretty much what you're getting before you enter the theatre, not so with Deadpool. It's absolutely unique in it's offbeat tone and the story is also very compelling, despite some characters being a little one-dimensional, but I think the director made good choices of which characters to humanize to fit the tone of the film. Tim Miller keeps things energized from start to finish, the comic momentum almost never quits and the action scenes are brilliantly shot and edited in this very kinetic and visceral style. The musical score also hits some really funny notes, with some nicely placed hits by DMX, Wham and Neil Sedaka amongst others. How much do I love this movie?? I've already seen it twice and I'm seeing it again later this week. Never before has there been such a perfect blend of raunchy comedy, romance, action, comic booky goodness and endless self-referentialism. This movie doesn't care what the masses think. It exists to give a severed-hand middle finger to the glut of overly serious, often mediocre comic book movies from recent years. It even makes fun of it's own budget cuts by Fox studios and makes endless jokes about that terrible first Wolverine movie and Hugh Jackman, who was in fact a big part of getting this movie made. This movie is so much fun. See it. See it right now. Or you'll be on Deadpool's naughty list.",10,5,16,17 February 2016
Gladiator," A clichéd directionless mess with some good visuals
","The film opens in Ancient Germania, with a battle that could have been spectacular were it not for the choppy cameras. (Is it just me, or do dogs jumping over walls of fire seem lame?) This scene should have been the highlight of the film, but it is hard to tell what is going on.The rest of the film really loses direction, like it can't decide whether to be political or revenge-based. Why does everyone want Commodus dead? In what way is he running a 'dictatorship'? This may have been explained but the movie is far too short. Apart from Commodus, all of the characters are 1-dimensional and tiresome. There are a few good fight scenes but they don't really fit into the story. I give this a 6/10 because there are some interesting elements (all involving Commodus, the only believable character).",8,0,1,16 September 2004
Donnie Darko," Funny, touching, sad and thoughtful. A masterpeice!
","Donnie Darko, a surprisingly low-budget film, is a bit like the movie Frequency: What if you could change the course of time? Would you really want to if you knew the consequences? Frequency was significantly less funny than Donnie Darko, which is one reason why Donnie is better. Not only does the end make you think about what you've seen, but it makes so much sense when you think about it... 20/10! What a movie!",10,0,1,7 June 2003
