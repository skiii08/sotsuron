Mission: Impossible III," mission impossible series comes full circle
","This is the third and possibly the best in the series. The new storyline is a real thrill ride. Ethan Hunt is fighting a terrorist while also trying to save his girlfriend's life from the terrorist. He does everything he can to make sure that his girlfriend doesn't know what the truth is about his job. This movie is a real thrill ride from the beginning to the end, every moment keeps you in suspense. The story has you rivited from one moment to the next which is what the series is all about. Tom Cruise also does some totally amazing stunts in this one that really gives the movie a good steady push.If you are a fan of the series, this is definitely one to have in your collection. If you have never seen the series before, it is definitely one to rent out. Everyone in this movie really did an excellent job, especially with the storyline.

The Girl Next Door," teenager graduating learns the true meaning of respect for another person
","When I first rented this movie, I was actually expecting to watch another usual teen comedy, but, what I wound up seeing was the 2006 version of how a boy who is graduating learns the real meaning of how to respect another person. When we first meet the young boy, he hangs out with a not so popular crowd and seems very frustrated by it. One evening while taking out the garbage, he winds up meeting his new next neighbour, 'the girl next door' and he falls in love with her at first sight because she is physically beautiful. After he accidentally sees her without her top on, they actually wind up going out for the evening, and that is when the true meaning of a relationship starts up between them. She actually starts showing him how to have respect for a girl, and this wonderful message actually becomes the basis for the whole story. The two actually have a real chemistry together. The movie itself winds up giving out the wonderful message to the youth of today and tomorrow that if you don't respect another person, you don't know what a real relationship is. The movie itself is a real 'classic' in my opinion for this reason and that is why I am glad to have it in my DVD collection. I would honestly consider this to be a real modern day 'cinderella story' and I really hope to see Hollywood making more of these types of films, because honestly, these are the types of films that dreams are made of.The movie itself also has a lot of good laughs in it. If you want to do yourself a favor, either rent it for the evening or buy it to enjoy it over and over.",8,4,5,11 November 2006
Disturbia," teenager on house arrest winds up finding some very creative things to do
","I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a very well done movie from start to finish. The movie itself is actually a remake of the Hitchcock classic 'rear window' but it has definitely been modernized but in a fun way.The main character winds up under house arrest with a high tech sensor attached to his leg which literally doesn't allow him to be more than a few more feet from the house without there being serious consequences. The nice part about this movie is that the script is really polished nicely from beginning to end. Once the main character starts off being under house arrest the fun begins. He is told to be very creative with his time, and even though he has his TV and computer games taken away from him he winds up having to use the environment around him to keep himself amused. This is where the well done script kicks into high gear with the other characters being well developed into action, each helping to make the story more interesting. Mainly the different characters help to make up different types of suspense which make it a top notch thriller. Even the 'girl next door' who turns into his love interest develops in a nice realistic fashion. The best part about this movie is that the script is developed in such a professional manner that it just keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how things are going to turn out. Probably the best part of this movie is that it is totally worth watching, because the director did such a good job and the actors did such a great job. If you don't get a chance to see it in the theatres then do yourself a favor and treat yourself to it on either rental or for purchase, you won't be sorry.",7,5,11,27 April 2007
