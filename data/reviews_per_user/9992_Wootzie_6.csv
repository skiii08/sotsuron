Ford v Ferrari," The Car is the Star
","Ford vs Ferrari is a good, fun movie for those of us who like cars. It's got a good story, great camera work, and is well paced. Caitriona Belfe was perfectly cast, and so was Christian Bale. The one criticism I had was that several performances were easy; it didn't feel like some of the performances really had to reach that far, didn't have to extend themselves into the roles that much, just sort of going through the motions. The car(s) ultimately felt like the star of the movie, plural because there are plenty of nice car eye candy throughout. Again, I enjoyed this movie, it was fun and satisfying, and had some good funny moments.",7,0,2,18 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Better than expected
","What really makes this movie are the visuals and the colors. The acting is pretty good, particularly given the dystopian nature of the film from setting to how people interact. Despite some slightly loose parts of the plot, the story generally holds together. The dialogue is sometimes a little bit muted and mundane, but in its own way it contributes to the story. I watched this movie twice, and found myself really getting more into it the second time. As I said above the colors, stark contrasts, visuals, and depth-of-field for some of the expensive scenic shots are amazing.",8,2,12,5 January 2019
Inglourious Basterds," In its own league
","How do you make a movie about Nazi's fun? You give the keys to Quentin Tarantino, and add amazing performances by Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. The plot is amazing, performances by the leads and supporting cast solid, it's a movie that I can watch and re-watch and not get bored.",8,1,4,31 January 2019
Downfall," Gripping
","This movie is amazing. The performances all around are superb, and the attention to detail is remarkable. Definitely worthy of the Academy Award. The performance of Hitler is incredible. It's one of the few movies about Nazi's and Nazi leadership where I didn't feel sympathetic, but was reminded that they too were human beings. That's not any kind of excuse for who they were or what they did, but there still is a human element that is conveyed, that they had emotions and feelings of loss, despair, and sadness. Totally worth a watch.",9,1,1,31 January 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," To the nines!
","Excess, excess, EXCESS! This movie was amazing from start to finish. A complete study in people who had more money than common sense, but were smart (for a time). The story is great, the acting is great, the sets are great...you get the point.",8,0,1,31 January 2019
Saints and Soldiers," A long walk in the woods
","If you like movies with lots of scenes of actors walking in seemingly endless snowy woods, then you'll love this movie. Clearly, the studio check book was on another sound stage/studio. It became very apparent not long after the film began that this wasn't a big budget war film because the movie is filled with scenes of snowy fields and trees, and the actors walking through them. The producers needed to save the budget, so you really only get one action sequence at the end, presumably with the reuse of German soldiers who were killed at one part of the action sequence and then used again later (you'll only see two or three soldiers chasing the heroes at any one time, but it's suggested that the heroes are surrounded by a vast force that's never really there). The movie is predictable, you know who will make it and who won't, and you'll be stuck for nine-tenths of the movie looking at snow and listening to stupid dialogue. Oh, and naturally there's a cute French girl 2/3rds of the way through who shows up for no real reason. Bottom line is that if you're looking for a war movie with a plot and action, look elsewhere. But if you like to look at trees and snow and people walking through it aimlessly, then jackpot! Historical note: if the soldiers were where the movie suggests they would be, the forests would be crawling with German soldiers, so the hero's wouldn't be stopping and talking in the open as much as they do in this movie.",3,0,0,28 March 2018
