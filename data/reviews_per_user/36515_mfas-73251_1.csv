The Avengers," V Enjoyable the hate is silly
","This film in essence is a fan boy film and hits all the spots you could've asked for as a marvel fan. Most the negative reviews I've seen of this film pull on aspects like too CGI dependent and compare it to films like dark knight or watchmen. Although films like watchmen and dark knight are superhero flicks like Avengers it's a very different ball park. Avengers is a fun ride with enjoyable characters, a great villain, good action, and it manages to do what no film of its time was able to. Successfully pull multiple main characters into a shared story which doesn't feel like overkill. The CGI element wasn't that big of a problem for me either. I do love practical effects and they trump CGI for me most of the time but when you've got such a heavy sci-fi story like this one you can't dream of using practical. It would be way too expensive and would take something away from the film for me. If you've never seen avengers and you love action, comedy and colourful costumes I urge you to check this out",8,0,0,7 July 2019
