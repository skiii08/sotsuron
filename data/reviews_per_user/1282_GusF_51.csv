The Blair Witch Project," An absolutely brilliant horror film
","Although this can safely be called one of the films that defined the 1990s, I had never seen it before. The film was not the first of the found footage genre but it is nevertheless an incredibly innovative film. The information about the Blair Witch and Rustin Parr is related to the audience early in the film through interviews with the people of Burkittsville, most of whom dismiss the stories about the Witch as nothing more than a local legend. This is a very clever idea as most towns have stories about ghosts which few take seriously. For instance, there is a castle not two miles from where I live which is supposedly haunted! The stories are regarded by Heather, Josh and Mike as cool material for their documentary but nothing more than that, certainly not as a warning for things to come. It foreshadows their later trouble for the audience but not the characters.The writers and directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez were able to give a new spin to a very old idea: that what you don't see is more frightening than what you do. This technique is used repeatedly and very effectively in the film with the noises that the characters hear at night. Several of these scenes take place in almost complete darkness, adding to the effect. The film was made on the cheap over a mere eight days and features no real special effects, instead relying on humanity's ancient and instinctual fear of the unknown to provide its scares rather than digitally rendered gods and monsters. Things like the weird, life size stick figures are enough to creep us out!The three lead actors Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams - who all use their real names - shot almost all of the film personally. They were given an outline of the plot but improvised the dialogue themselves. They interrupt each other and occasionally stumble over their words, giving the film a wonderfully authentic quality. This is helped by the fact that Heather, Josh and Mike all have flaws and seem like real people. None of them are especially pleasant people to begin with. As their situations worsens, we see them all go through waves of anger, upset and hysteria to the point that they're borderline unstable. Many of us would try to deny it but I think that 99% of people would react the same way. The fact that Heather keeps recording when logic would dictate that they drop the camera is explained by the fact that it helps her to cope. I would ditch it the first chance that I got but I can well imagine other people holding on to it for the same reason as Heather. There isn't a single part of their behaviour that doesn't ring true. Roger Ebert compared her wonderfully acted (and later much parodied!) apology to the camera to Robert Scott's final diary entries before he froze to death in the Antarctic and I think that that says it best.I don't usually comment on the promotional side of films but I think that it is worth mentioning in this case. It was one of the first films to be very heavily marketed on the Internet, something which we take for granted today but was groundbreaking in its day. A mockumentary - which, oddly enough, I had seen - was made to promote the film as were several tie-in websites concerning Burkittsville and the police investigation into the disappearances. It was essentially an attempt to do deliberately online what Orson Welles had done accidentally on the radio in 1938. It led to numerous debates as to whether the film was fiction or an actual documentary. We were all far too young to (officially!) see the film but I remember talking about with my friends in school at the time. This kind of campaign would probably not work in 2015 but it was a fantastic idea in 1999.",Null,2,5,14 March 2015
The Avengers," Good fun but still rather disappointing
","The highest grossing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one of the highest grossing films of all time, this is good fun but rather disappointing. I was hoping that the film would be as relentlessly enjoyable as 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', my favourite superhero film of recent years and my second favourite overall after 'Superman'. However, it never really reaches that the level that he could or should have. That said, it has quite a good script by Zak Penn and Joss Whedon and it is well directed by Whedon.As an ensemble film, it does not offer the same opportunity for the actors to shine as they did in their solo films but that is understandable, if again a little disappointing. Mark Ruffalo, replacing Edward Norton, makes a very impressive debut as Bruce Banner, a somewhat more neurotic character than in 'The Incredible Hulk' in spite of the fact that he has far more control over the Hulk than he did in that film. There was certainly a sense of inner conflict in the character but I think that this has more to do with Ruffalo's performance than the writing. Robert Downey, Jr. and Chris Hemsworth are as strong as Tony Stark and Thor respectively as they were in their own films but Chris Evans appears ever so slightly wooden as Steve Rogers in comparison. Downey certainly gets the best material of the four of them, which is unsurprising since he has the strongest and most interesting character. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are perfectly fine as Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton but their characters are far from interesting and, honestly, made no real impression on me. Characters who can kick ass still need personalities.Tom Hiddleston gives the best performance in the film as Loki, who on this occasion is merely the servant of a far greater power. Hiddleston is clearly having a whale of a time with the role and he gets many of the best lines in the film. Samuel L. Jackson finally gets more than a few scenes as Nick Fury and is as badass as you would expect. I did like the fact that they made him a somewhat morally ambiguous character. They tried to give Agent Coulson a personality in the film but he is likewise not a terribly interesting character, though Clark Gregg tries his best. I would have liked to have seen more of Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig since he was one of the best things about 'Thor' but he was excellent in spite of his limited screen time. The film also features nice appearances in smaller roles from Alexis Denisof, Powers Booth, Jenny Agutter and Harry Dean Stanton.The film is not structured terribly well and I felt that it spent a bit too much time on the petty bickering between the characters in the first half. It was a tad overlong. In terms of the action sequences, the attack on the Hellcarrier and all the associated scenes are certainly the most exciting. I thought that the Chitauri's arrival on Earth was left too late in the film's running time and, even when they arrived, it was not as exciting as I would have liked. Part of the problem that I had with them is that they are basically a faceless enemy. I would have preferred to have seen more of the Other or get a proper introduction to Thanos. I also wasn't too convinced by the ending. The special effects are certainly spectacular throughout the film. I loved the fact that the Hulk actually resembled Mark Ruffalo in the face! Overall, this is a fun superhero team-up film but I preferred all of the characters' previous individual films.",Null,2,9,20 September 2015
The Incredible Hulk," Great fun from start to finish
","After the X-Men and Spider-Man, the title character is probably the Marvel superhero with whom I am most familiar, albeit through the 1970s live-action series and the 1990s animated one. The film is great fun from start to finish. It may not have the same level of characterisation as its predecessor 'Iron Man' but I thought that the action scenes were more entertaining and the pacing was considerably better. The script is well written by Zak Penn and the star Edward Norton (uncredited in this capacity) and Louis Leterrier directs the film with style. It's a shame that the Hulk has gone on to become the Marvel Cinematic Universe's answer to the Wolf Man in that he got one film (the 2003 version notwithstanding) and then only showed up in crossover films rather than getting a sequel to himself. The film had great potential for a proper sequel but I don't really see it happening at this stage.Norton is extremely good as Bruce Banner who, in this version of events, was exposed to gamma radiation deliberately in a failed attempt by the US military to revive its World War II super-soldier project, something which would later be explored on screen in much more detail in 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I generally prefer superheroes with powers as opposed to non-powered ones and the thing that I always liked about the Hulk's storyline is that there is a great sense of inner conflict. The Hulk represents the primitive, bestial side of human nature and is, in that sense, a throwback to our distant ancestors while Banner represents the better angels of our nature. We all have to struggle with the more primitive parts of us at times, though not quite so literally. However, the line is blurred somewhat in the film as the Hulk is not as animalistic as in other versions. The script does not allow Norton the same opportunity as Robert Downey, Jr. to play a character who grows and develops over the course of the film. However, he gives a great, understated performance and I always felt that the Hulk was just beneath the surface, waiting to manifest himself. I'm rather disappointed that this was Norton's only outing in the role.Betty Ross, played well by Liv Tyler, is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked but she is much better than Pepper Potts in 'Iron Man'. Betty is extremely intelligent, kind, brave, resourceful and loyal. It is obvious from the beginning why Bruce is attracted to her. Speaking of which, their romantic moments seemed a great deal more realistic and heartfelt than those between Tony and Pepper in 'Iron Man' and I am including the very sweet scene in which she calms down the Hulk in that. Bruce and Betty seem much more evenly managed and suited to each other, frankly. Tim Roth is as creepy and effective as you would expect as the Russian-born British Royal Marines officer Emil Blonsky but I would have preferred a better actor than the decent but not great William Hurt as General Ross. Tim Blake Nelson is great as Samuel Sterns and Ty Burrell has a nice cameo role as Betty's new boyfriend Leonard Samson. In a refreshing move, the film avoids the obvious cliché of making the other man in the love triangle a complete ass. Leonard is a nice, decent guy.The CGI in the film is very good if not quite state of the art by 2008 standards. It is at its most impressive during the hugely entertaining climactic battle between the Hulk and the mutated Blonsky. The Hulk looked better in the nighttime scenes than in the daytime ones. It was a good idea from a dramatic point of view that the Hulk's manifestations were relatively few and far between. I appreciated the somewhat light-hearted atmosphere of the film and the references to the 1970s TV series, most notably Lou Ferrigno's cameo as a security guard - he also provided the voice of the Hulk - and the clip of Bill Bixby, a lovely tribute to the late actor who is more associated with the role of David Banner (what's in a name?) than anyone else.Overall, this is a very enjoyable films which film rollicks along at a great pace and does not take itself too seriously. After 'Magic', this the second film that I have watched in three days which explores the idea of a person having two personalities, incidentally.",Null,0,1,16 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Far better than it's made out to be
","They were a few aspects of it that I really intensely disliked (chief among the racial caricatures, perhaps the most blatant of which is the Neimodians' 'Engrish' manner of speaking) but, on the whole, I felt that the good elements outnumbered the bad ones. The pod race was probably my least favourite extended sequence of the film. Jar Jar didn't jar jar on me (sorry, I had to...) nearly as much as I thought that he would. In fact, I found his accent, another racial caricature there, considerably more annoying than his antics and I actually laughed at him in the manner which George Lucas intended several times.On the negative side, Jake Lloyd was simply not up to being cast in a major role in a major film. Frankly, he just can't act but I blame George Lucas for casting him as opposed to Lloyd himself. The rest of the cast was better though. Liam Neeson, as ever, made for a strong leading man. Natalie Portman came across well during the scenes in which she played Padmé but less well in her scenes out of disguise. Speaking of which, I love the fact that in spite of her planet being invaded and occupied and her own life being in dire peril, Queen Amidala seemingly brought suitcases full of dozens of elaborate outfits and make up supplies and (when not in disguise) did not hesitate to have her servants change her clothes at least a few times a﻿ day when her people were under attack and starving. Nice to know where her priorities lie! Ewan McGregor's performance came across as unusually flat compared to some of his other roles and I felt that he deserved more screen time.Although I didn't mind Jar Jar nearly as much as some people, I still think that he could have done with less screen time whereas I wish that Yoda and C-3PO had had more. Ian McDiarmid gave a great performance as the scheming puppet master of the galaxy in both of his personae but the irritating Gungan dialect actually managed to detract from BRIAN BLESSED's sheer awesomeness, insofar as that's possible.Having recently rewatched the 'Star Trek' reboot films, I realised how awful they are, particularly 'Into Darkness'. It made me truly appreciate for the first time just how disappointed 'Star Wars' fans must have felt when it came to the prequels.",Null,2,4,29 December 2014
Iron Man 3," Deathly dull
","It looks nice and there are some nice ideas but the script is deathly dull and the film is incredibly slow. Robert Downey, Jr. is as great as ever, Guy Pearce is good fun as Aldrich Killian and Ben Kingsley is quite good as the Mandarin in the second half of the film but the rest of the main cast is forgettable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress but the character of Pepper Potts has even less of a personality than in the first two films. Harley is incredibly annoying. Why they thought that the film needed an annoying kid sidekick is beyond me. My favourite line is Tony's description of Trevor Slattery as 'Sir Laurence Oblivier.' The dialogue in the second half is generally wittier, on the bright side. The barrel of monkeys scene is certainly the best.Coincidentally, both Downey and Kingsley played the title character of biopics directed by Richard Attenborough. Sadly, this film's director Shane Black is no Attenborough. It's not even anywhere near as good as Jon Favreau, whom I wish had returned as the director on this occasion. This was generally better received than 'Iron Man 2' but I thought that film was considerably better. Honestly, I was so bored that I was waiting for Stan Lee's cameo for half the film in much the same way as I waited for Michael G. Wilson's cameo in 'Quantum of Solace'. That's...never really a good sign. There is some doubt as to whether there will be an 'Iron Man 4'. If there isn't one, I can live with that since I found that the films abide by the law of diminishing returns. The film did get one thing right though: War Machine is a much better name than Iron Patriot.",Null,2,5,24 October 2015
Spartacus," A brilliantly written and acted tale of freedom, political machinations and love in the Roman Republic
","Based on the 1951 novel by Howard Fast rather than the events of the Third Servile War directly, the film depicts Spartacus' slave rebellion with all the flair and grandeur that 1960s Hollywood could muster. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it is a thrilling story of freedom, political machinations and love set in the ancient world. It is a very well written film with often marvellous dialogue.At 43, Kirk Douglas was perhaps a little old to play the title character but he is very good as the dignified, principled man who wishes to free every last slave in Italy. Like Charlton Heston, he has a face that looked as if it was chiseled from marble which gave him the perfect look for historical epics. More importantly, Douglas' performance effectively communicates Spartacus' intelligence and courage and I never doubted why so many would be willing to follow him anywhere. To his followers, he is a symbol of hope or even a Messiah but, for the audience, he is humanised through his relationship with Varinia, played by Jean Simmons. They meet in Batiatus' gladiator training school and soon fall in love. It is a gentle, tender love story and Douglas is at its best in these scenes. He and Simmons have great chemistry. One of the most gifted actresses of her generation, Simmons excels as the proud, brave and intelligent Varinia. As good as she is in her scenes with Douglas, her best moment is the scene towards the end of the film after she is recaptured and sold to Crassus, played by Laurence Olivier, in which he threatens to kill her newborn son if she does not submit to him. Varinia realises that he is afraid of Spartacus and disturbed by the fact that he inspired so much love and devotion, not least of all from her. Simmons, who previously played the Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet, plays this scene wonderfully and we get a real sense of Varinia's strength.Speaking of Olivier, he is characteristically excellent as Crassus, one of Rome's greatest generals and one of the wealthiest men to have ever lived. A patrician from a very old Roman family who despises the mob, he is an extremely shrewd military and political strategist who manipulates the threat posed by Spartacus to substantially increase his own political standing. He is eventually named Consul of Rome with Julius Caesar as his protégé, thereby beginning the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. On the battlefield, he manages to defeat Spartacus by forcing him to march on Rome where not only his own legions but those of Pompey and Lucullus are waiting for him. Crassus is a very dangerous man of fierce intelligence, which makes him a very compelling character. In his penultimate film before his death in 1962, the great Charles Laughton is wonderful as Gracchus, the (fictional) leader of the Senate and Crassus' hated rival. Gracchus is an interesting character who is even more shrewd than Crassus. He does not believe in the gods but worships them publicly and is perfectly willing to make deals with criminals, namely the Cilician pirates, if he believes that doing so is in the interests of Rome. He is part of the corruption that plagues the Roman Republic but considers that better than a dictatorship and I certainly can't disagree with him there. Gracchus is not a particularly good man but he is a far better one than his rival.As strong as the film's cast may be, it is the one and only Peter Ustinov who steals the show as the slave trader Batiatus. He won the first of two Best Supporting Actor Oscars for the role, the only actor to win an Oscar for a Kubrick film. Batiatus is scornful of Crassus in private but extremely obsequious to him whenever they meet. He has a very strong sense of self-preservation or, to put it another way, he is a complete coward. This is best demonstrated when Crassus orders him to remain in camp the night before the final battle with Spartacus so he can identify him. When Batiatus asks what will happen to him if Spartacus wins, Crassus tells Batiatus that he has no doubt that he will help Spartacus to identify him. This is one of Batiatus' best scenes as it perfectly illustrates that his first loyalty is most definitely to himself. He possibly becomes a better man after being flogged on Crassus' order but he never comes to regret his earlier actions and only agrees to transport Varinia and her son out of Rome in exchange for two million sestertii. Tony Curtis is good as Antoninus and I love the father-son relationship that develops between him and Spartacus but he is underdeveloped, making him the least interesting of the major characters. With his tough guy image, Curtis may have been miscast as a singer and poet with no practical experience of fighting before joining Spartacus' army. The only weak links are Charles McGraw as Marcellus and John Dall as Marcus Glabrus but neither of them have particularly big roles.Overall, this is an extremely intelligent film. Spartacus is crucified, meaning that it lacks a traditional Hollywood ending but there is still a great sense of hope as his son has been granted his freedom. My main historical area of interest is about 2,000 years after Spartacus' death but I think that the film sticks to the general thrust of events while admittedly taking quite a few liberties here and there. However, these are only minor issues which in no way detract from a brilliant film, one of the best of the historical epics which dominated 1950s and 1960s Hollywood.",Null,0,0,25 April 2015
Star Trek," Not only a bad film but 'Star Trek' in name only
","When I saw this in the cinema, I loved it. Looking back, I think that that was because I had been completely starved of new 'Star Trek' for four years and was willing to accept it on that basis alone. Unfortunately, it does not hold up on a second viewing with a more critical eye. Continuing with the Bond comparison that I made in my review of 'Nemesis', it is trying to be 'Star Trek''s answer to 'Casino Royale' but it falls far short of that. The reason is that that film was made by people who understood Bond while this film was not made by people who understood 'Star Trek'.On the bright side, Chris Pine is very good as Kirk, perfectly capturing the character's cockiness, intelligence and resourcefulness without doing an imitation of William Shatner. However, I thought that Kirk and McCoy - played very well by Karl Urban - were the only characters who were really treated well in the film. Given that the alternate reality Kirk grew up without the benefit of a father or even a decent father figure, it's unsurprising that he turned out differently than the TOS Kirk, who was far less rebellious in his youth, and this is handled well. That said, an issue that I had this Kirk's backstory was that his mother's influence on him is never mentioned. After she gives birth to him, she is mentioned exactly twice in the film and never by Kirk himself. Why is it that the influence of mothers is often ignored in films like this? I had a similar problem with the original 'Star Wars' in which the orphan Luke Skywalker asks Obi-Wan about his father and it seemingly never occurred to him to ask him if he knew his mother. It'd be the first question that I'd ask after meeting someone who knew my father.Other than McCoy who is characterised perfectly, the rest of the TOS regular characters come across as caricatures rather than characters in their own right. The alternate reality Spock never really seems like Spock and this is not helped by the fact that Zachary Quinto is no Leonard Nimoy, whose participation in the film is by far the best part of it incidentally. I literally cheered when he appeared on screen. I really, really hope that Spock jettisoning Kirk for mutiny was supposed to be a sign of his emotional instability after the death of his mother and the destruction of Vulcan since, otherwise, there is no reason for it to happen other than the script said it had to for Kirk to meet the original Spock. My hopes are not high in that regard though.Simon Pegg's Scotty is sort of funny but bears little resemblance to Scotty. Zoe Saldana and Anton Yelchin are likable as Uhura and Chekov and at least seem more like their TOS counterparts than Scotty does but they don't make much impression. Can't say that I'm terribly excited about the Spock / Uhura romance. John Cho makes no impression as Sulu, delivering every line in a monotone. Like Nimoy, Ben Cross and Bruce Greenwood add some much needed dignity to the film as Sarek and Captain Pike respectively. Eric Bana is boring as Nero who, much like Shinzon in 'Nemesis', is another poor man's Khan. He too is obsessed with having his revenge against one of the main characters whom he blames for the death of his wife.Lots and lots of lens flare but every joke about them has been done to death so I'll leave that there. I can't criticise the special effects which are state of the art and many of the action scenes are well done but because the script is nowhere near as intelligent as those of earlier 'Star Trek' films, it's hard to really care about them. The film looks good but so what? Most big budget films do. That doesn't make them good in and of themselves. Anyway, for me, the special effects in a film are like the side dish while the acting and the script, both of which aren't great overall in this case, are the main course. 'Star Trek' has always been about big ideas and social commentary rather than flashy effects and stuff getting blowed up real good and this film just doesn't get that. Now, let's be honest, scientific accuracy was never 'Star Trek''s strongest suit but the idea of a star going supernova threatening the galaxy is complete hokum.Overall, it's not a terrible film but it is both a bad film and a bad 'Star Trek' film. I actually preferred 'The Final Frontier' and 'Nemesis' to this one. At the end of the day, I'd rather have bad 'Star Trek' films with characters whom I love than bad films that are 'Star Trek' in name only with generally poor versions of said characters.",Null,0,1,5 December 2014
Citizen Kane," In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree
","After 'Back to the Future' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird', this is my third favourite film of all time. Only 25 years old at the time that it was made, Orson Welles made one of the greatest films of all time. There are not many actors or directors whom I would describe as artists but, in my view, Welles was one of his generation's two greatest artists in the filmmaking sphere, the other being Laurence Olivier. His skills as a director have been much praised over the course of the last 74 years but I want to focus on his skills as an actor first of all. As Charles Foster Kane, Welles is simply magnificent. Through the various flashbacks, we learn about the different sides of the man's character and he excels at playing all of them. Welles plays Kane over a period of more than 50 years and does so with a great deal more passion and gravitas than many actors of comparable age are capable of.The newsreel footage in the first ten minutes is crucial to our understanding of Kane as it not only places his life in chronological order but it gives us insight into the manner in which he is viewed by the public. The former is significant given the film's format of flashbacks while the latter allows us to contrast the public man with the private man. As shown by his genuinely and deeply meant Declaration of Principles and his confrontation with Thatcher, Kane's motives are pure at the beginning of his journalistic career but he becomes more and more ruthless in his pursuit of power as the years and decades pass by. This is best seen in the recollections of Jed Leland, the closest thing that he had a friend. Leland tells the intrepid journalist Jerry Thompson that he did not think that Kane loved anyone except for himself and his mother. The obvious implication from that statement is that Kane married his first wife Emily Norton as she is the niece of the US President. He comes to neglect her but this pales in comparison to the emotional abuse which he inflicts on his second wife Susan Alexander, which eventually leads her to attempt suicide. In spite of Kane's myriad flaws, I felt pity for him as his actions meant that he was left with no one to care about him. He made a fortune but money cannot buy happiness, as is portrayed in the film in an almost Dickensian way. This is best illustrated by the fact that his dying thoughts are of his boyhood sleigh Rosebud. On his deathbed, he recalls the last time in his life that he was truly happy, playing in the snow outside his mother's boarding house. For Kane, the sleigh represents perfect happiness and his own conception of Elysium. Its simplicity serves as a wonderful contrast to the cold opulence of the 49,000 acre estate of Xanadu, which becomes something of a prison to him in his last years. The sleigh's destruction in the film's final scene represents the death of Kane's dream of achieving happiness.Welles and his co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz gave all of the best bits to the actor-director himself but our understanding of Kane would be nothing without the supporting characters. The most important of these is perhaps Jed Leland, played very well by Welles' close friend Joseph Cotten. He is most effective as the elderly Leland in the framework scenes and the scene in which Leland, while very drunk, tells Kane exactly what he thinks of him after he loses the gubernatorial election. Leland remains constant throughout the film and this provides another fantastic contrast, this time to Kane himself. If you look carefully, you can also spot Cotten as one of the journalists shrouded in darkness after the newsreel has been played. Dorothy Comingore is excellent as Susan Alexander, a well meaning but not terribly bright or talented young woman whose life is gradually destroyed by Kane. He had something to prove in building the opera house for her and does not allow her to stop singing because it would be too embarrassing for him, not caring at all about the affect that the humiliation is having on her. The rest of the cast is very strong as well, particularly Everett Sloane as the ever loyal Mr Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, Ruth Warrick as Emily Norton Kane, Ray Collins as Jim Gettys, William Alland as Jerry Thompson and Paul Stewart as Kane's callous butler Raymond. The most interesting of the minor characters is Kane's mother Mary, played wonderfully by Agnes Moorehead.The manner in which the film was shot was absolutely innovative in its time and it still looks beautiful. Welles and the cinematographer Gregg Toland pioneered the technique of deep focus for the silver screen in which every part of the frame is in focus simultaneously. This is perhaps best illustrated by the scene in which Mary Kane makes Thatcher her son's legal guardian while the young Kane can be seen playing in the background. What makes it even more impressive is that most of this scene is shot in a single take, as are numerous other scenes in the film. Another very impressively shot scene is the party scene in which Kane celebrates coaxing the Daily Chronicle's best journalists to defect to the Inquirer after six years of trying. this scene involves Kane and numerous chorus girls singing and dancing in the background while Leland and Bernstein have a private conversation in the foreground. At several points, we see Kane reflected in the window on the other side of them. This must have been a logistical nightmare for Welles to shoot but he did it brilliantly.",Null,1,3,9 May 2015
The Birth of a Nation," As brilliantly made as it is incredibly racist
","Based on the 1905 novel 'The Clansman' by Thomas F. Dixon, Jr., this silent film epic is as brilliantly made as it is incredibly racist. It has often been hailed as one of the most important films in cinematic history because of the techniques that its director D. W. Griffith, a master of his craft, pioneered while working on it. Many of the techniques that audiences now take for granted such as long shots, pan shots and frequent use of intercutting made their first appearance here. The battle scenes are thrilling, beautifully staged and surprisingly violent for the time. The script by Griffith and Frank E. Woods is very well structured and, while it inspired many feelings in me, boredom was not one of them. The film depicts a version of the United States, North and South, and its people, black and white, which only ever existed in the minds of bitter Southerners. Its warped, ahistorical treatment of race relations led to widespread protests by the NAACP, riots in several major cities and, according to one report, the murder of a black teenager by a white man as a direct result of the latter watching the film (though the evidence is less than conclusive). The film has also been blamed for contributing to the revival of the Ku Klux Klan, which had essentially ceased to exist in the 1870s but returned with a vengeance over the course of the next few years. The storyline follows two families, the Northern Stonemans and the Southern Camerons, who are acquainted as a result of the fact that the eldest sons attended boarding school together. The film's first half concerns the prelude to the Civil War and the war itself while the second concerns Reconstruction. Austin Stoneman, played by Ralph Lewis, is the Speaker of the House of Representatives and a thinly veiled version of the Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, even possessing a club foot. Like Stevens, Stoneman is not only an abolitionist but believes that blacks and whites are equal. As such, he is one of the major villains of the piece. The other major villain, his biracial protégé Silas Lynch, does not appear until the second half but he is depicted as being a truly evil, venomous character who seeks to create a Black Empire in the South with himself as its king. The only other African-American shown to have any real intelligence is Stoneman's housekeeper Lydia Brown, who is likewise biracial. Based on Stevens' housekeeper and alleged lover Lydia Hamilton Smith, she only appears briefly but she is clearly intended as a Lady Macbeth type who manipulates Stoneman into going along with her ideas of equality. Most of the other black characters are depicted as being ultra- violent, cruel, detestable and sometimes little more than animals. In one particularly disturbing scene, a black renegade named Gus - played by Walter Long in blackface - attempts to rape the fragile waif Flora Cameron, ultimately driving her to commit suicide. The implication of this scene is clear: black men will rape and kill every white Southern woman unless the KKK does something about them. It's one of the most sickening sequences in a film which has no shortage of them, particularly in its second half. The only black characters portrayed in a sympathetic light are the Camerons' 'faithful souls' - perfect illustrations of the Mammy and Uncle stereotypes - and various slaves who were much happier before they were freed. The majority of the black characters are played by white actors in blackface but there are many black extras in the background. They were probably glad to get some work but I have to wonder what they thought of the film, especially Madame Sul-Te-Wan whose parents were freed slaves.Although the film is perhaps best remembered for its glorification of the KKK, they do not actually appear until 2 hours and 5 minutes into the 3 hour and 13 minute running time but they certainly make their presence felt after that. They are described as 'the organisation that saved the South from the anarchy of black rule' and that really says it all when it comes to the film's attitude towards them. They are depicted performing several supposedly heroic feats such as hanging Gus, dumping his corpse on Lynch's doorstep and rescuing the bound and gagged Elsie Stoneman before she can be forced into marrying Lynch. The Klan's founder is Elsie's lover Ben Cameron, otherwise known as 'the Little Colonel.'One thing that surprised me was the fact that Abraham Lincoln was treated very positively with Dr. Cameron even describing him as 'our best friend' when it comes to Reconstruction. There are some moments that seemed genuine such as Phil Stoneman and Margaret Cameron's shy interaction when they first meet and Elsie putting on a brave face as her three brothers leave for war before bursting into tears the moment that they leave. It's a lovely little moment which is wonderfully acted by Lillian Gish. Although most of the characters are misconceived to some degree, the film nevertheless has a very strong cast: Miriam Cooper as Margaret, Henry B. Walthall as Colonel Cameron, Mary Alden as Lydia Brown, Ralph Lewis as Stoneman, Elmer Clifton as Phil, Spottiswoode Aitken as Dr. Cameron and Josephine Crowell as Mrs. Cameron.Overall, neither the importance of the film nor its racism have been exaggerated. I think Roger Ebert said it best: 'Like Riefenstahl's 'The Triumph of the Will', it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil.'I'm sort of torn about how to rate this film. In terms of quality, I'd give it 10/10. If I were to rate it in terms of morality (something that I have never done before and may never do again), I'd give it 0/10.",Null,2,4,30 May 2016
Iron Man 2," A good sequel but it's not on the same level as the first film
","This is a good sequel but it is not on the same level as either the first film or 'The Incredible Hulk'. The script by Justin Theroux is quite strong, if not without its flaws, and Jay Favreau's direction is assured but the film loses its momentum in its last half an hour or so, which is when superhero films should be at their most exciting.The ever charismatic Robert Downey, Jr. is once again excellent as Tony Stark, delivering a quirky and engrossing performance as the unlikely superhero. Tony's characterisation is perhaps the strongest asset of the 'Iron Man' films and I liked the fact that becoming Iron Man did not solve all of his problems or wipe away his personality defects. He is still a very conflicted character, something which is further explored on this occasion through his relationship with his long dead father Howard. The fact that he is slowly dying of palladium poisoning adds an interesting dimension to the film as his erratic and reckless behaviour causes both his closest friends and the US government in lose faith in him. It also serves to illustrate that he is far from perfect. Like the rest of us, he just does the best that he can. I loved the fact that he was able to keep his sense of humour throughout. The scene in which he testifies in front of the Senate Committee is one of my favourites.I had never seen Mickey Rourke in a film before but I was extremely impressed with his performance as Ivan Vanko, a brilliant Russian scientist who was raised to despise the Stark family by his father Anton in a Soviet-era Siberian prison camp. Not exactly the best environment for children. Vanko is in many ways a dark reflection to Tony, which makes him a very interesting character. He is also quite a frightening one, not least because he is very physically imposing. Sam Rockwell is a laugh riot as Tony's affably evil corporate competitor Justin Hammer. He reminded me of the fictionalised version of Salieri from 'Amadeus' who is extremely resentful of Mozart's genius and success. Hammer, who has a massive inferiority complex, believes that he would be the top dog if it wasn't for Tony and is not content to simply be a member of the pack. In some respects, he is likewise a dark reflection to Tony and, as such, he and Vanko complement each other very well.As in the first film, I did not particularly like the depiction of the major female characters. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Pepper Potts but she has zero chemistry with Downey. The character is as dull as dishwater and contributes even less to the plot on this occasion. Scarlett Johansson is likewise perfectly fine as Natasha Romanoff but that's about it. Natasha is clearly a very skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and she can kick ass and all that but it's hard to care about a character, male or female, who can do all that if they don't have a personality. Neither actress has a chance to excel as they are lumbered with not particularly interesting characters, which stands out as all of the male characters (except maybe Agent Coulson) have clearly defined personalities. For instance, Samuel L. Jackson has very little screen time but he makes a much stronger impression as Nick Fury is such a great character, though this is certainly helped by his considerable screen presence. Favreau has more to do in front of the camera in this film than in the first and has some great moments as Happy Hogan. Don Cheadle is okay as Colonel James Rhodes but I much preferred the more charismatic and likable Terrence Howard in the role and I wish that he had returned. The film features nice appearances in smaller roles from John Slattery as Howard Stark and Garry Shandling as the utterly obnoxious Senator Stern and I really liked the cameos from Stan Lee (again mistaken for someone else!), Elon Musk, Christiane Amanpour and Bill O'Reilly, who behaves in exactly the way that you expect him to do if Iron Man was a real person. However, Paul Bettany didn't have the same chance to shine as J.A.R.V.I.S. in this film.The film looks fantastic and most of the action scenes are generally exciting, the best being the initial fight scene between Tony and Vanko on the Monaco racetrack. However, their supposedly climactic fight scene is decidedly anti-climactic as it was over so quickly. I assumed that they would do the standard, though almost always entertaining, thing where the hero thinks that the villain has been defeated but it turns out that he hasn't. Even after this did not happen, I expected the film to reveal that Vanko was still alive and would one day return to seek his revenge. The fact that his defeat was comparatively easy meant that it was a little underwhelming and the same holds true for Hammer. All I could think was, 'Is that it?' I like the hero to get a good run for his money but I don't think that it was quite good enough in the film. Ah, well. Can't win 'em all.Overall, this is a good, fun superhero film but it could have benefited from stronger female characters and sharper writing towards the end. Still, it is a worthy entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Null,0,3,17 September 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not only the worst 'Star Trek' film but a dreadful one in its own right
","This film is just awful. The hilariously deep voiced Benedict Cumberbatch is dreadful as Khan, delivering an embarrassingly camp performance. Does he have to open his mouth almost all the way whenever he delivers a line? It was not a good idea to bring him back in the first place but it could have been done well with good writing and a good actor who was right for the part, neither of which was in evidence here. The scene in which Carol Marcus strips down to her underwear is shameless, pointless and exploitative. It's not 1966 anymore. At least when they brought the Orion slave girls back in 'Enterprise', they attempted to give them more depth by revealing that the men were really the slaves and the women were the slavemasters.The whole point of creating a new timeline was supposed to be that they create new stories but this is just a badly characterised, badly written, generally badly acted and often cringeworthy rehash of 'Space Seed' and 'The Wrath of Khan' (for the third film in the row in the latter case...) which still manages not to feel like 'Star Trek'. Leonard Nimoy's cameo in the film is the one and only thing that I loved about the film. Other than him, Chris Pine, Karl Urban and Bruce Greenwood were the only actors who impressed me. Does Spock really have to have an emotional outburst in every film? Even Worf was less emotional than him most of the time. In the previous film, at least he had a good reason for it. A main part of the problem with this film is that Kirk and Spock don't particularly like each other and don't even know each other that well in stark contrast to the proper versions, meaning that some of the ripped off parts of 'The Wrath of Khan' barely even make sense in the context of the film. In any event, you don't want to remind people of better films when they're watching your bad one.This is not only the worst 'Star Trek' film but the worst film that I've seen all year. I suppose that makes me one of what Roberto Orci called the 'shitty fans'. You know, the ones whom Simon Pegg told to 'fuck off' for criticising the film. I'm tempted to not even watch the next one unless William Shatner and/or Leonard Nimoy are in it.",Null,4,6,6 December 2014
Spider-Man 2," A rare sequel that improves on its already very good predecessor in every respect
","A rare sequel that improves on its already very good predecessor in every respect, this is an absolutely brilliant superhero film. The film has a first rate screenplay by Alvin Sargent based on the storyline by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and Michael Chabon. In my review of the first film, I criticised it because I felt that some of the characterisation was lacking. On this occasion, however, the character work was placed to the forefront and it is never less than entirely convincing. It is not all character drama, however, as there are some very funny moments peppered throughout the film. Sam Raimi's direction is superb and the action scenes are far more exciting than those in the first film.Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker is excellent and I really felt for Peter as circumstances have placed him in more than one unenviable position. It has been almost two years since he became Spider-Man but he has yet to find a balance between his life as a crime fighter and his personal life. His lecturer Dr. Curt Connors laments that he is wasting his great scientific potential as his grades have been steadily declining and he seldom makes it to class on time. In a development clearly inspired by 'Superman II', Peter temporarily loses his powers and abandons his superhero mantle in the hope of resuming a normal life and pursuing his long held dream of having a relationship with Mary Jane Watson. In contrast to the earlier film, the reason behind Peter losing his powers is never specifically stated but I think that it was psychosomatic. After he focuses his attention entirely on being plain, simple Peter Parker, he is probably the happiest that he has been since before Uncle Ben's murder but the crime rate in New York City increases by 75% in Spidey's absence. He is inspired by Aunt May to resume web-slinging after she tells him that Spider-Man is a hero and sometimes heroes have to sacrifice the things that they want, even their dreams. This is a very effective character arc as it illustrates that life as a superhero is not all saving pretty girls from falling to their deaths and beating bad guys with alliterative names. It is often incredibly unfair but it carries great responsibility.Alfred Molina is wonderful as Dr. Otto Octavius, a leading nuclear physicist who is trying to create a viable means of fusion power in order to cure the world's ills. However, all does not go according to plan as the fusion reactor destabilises and Octavius' beloved wife Rosalie is killed in the resulting explosion. In the process, the four robotic arms that he had been using become bonded to his body and the inhibitor chip that he had designed to protect his higher brain functions are destroyed. As such, the arms' artificial intelligence begin to exert its influence on him and he becomes the supervillain Doctor Octopus. Octavius is a very tragic figure, considerably more so than Norman Osborn. He is a very nice man who takes a liking to Peter and would have perhaps become a mentor and close friend to him if things had turned out differently. Although Rosalie only appears in two scenes, the first of these is so well written that there is a clear sense of warmth, love and affection between her and her husband. Kirsten Dunst is very good as Mary Jane, benefiting from the stronger material that she has to work with this time around. She is enjoying great success in an Off-Broadway production of The Importance of Being Earnest and Peter promises to be there on time to finally see her critically acclaimed performance as Cecily. However, his extracurricular activities mean that he arrives late and is consequently refused admission. This causes Mary Jane to lose faith in him. In a lovely little scene, Peter 'confesses' his identity to her over the phone after the call has already ended. When he abandons his superhero lifestyle, he attempts to finally start a relationship with Mary Jane but she rebuffs on the basis that she is engaged to J. Jonah Jameson's son John. She later realises that she loves him but her timing is a little off as Peter had recently decided to resume his crime fighting. In order to protect her from his enemies, he lies to her and tells her that he does not love her. James Franco is very strong as Harry Osborn, who harbours a deep resentment towards Spider-Man as he believes that he murdered his father. His once very close friendship with Peter is suffering as he thinks that Peter is hiding the superhero's identity from him. Harry has become so obsessed with vengeance that he thinks of little else. Rosemary Harris likewise receives more interesting material in this film. One of the best moments involves Peter confessing to Aunt May that he could have stopped the carjacker who killed Uncle Ben. She is understandably shocked and upset by this but her initial reaction is to remain silent and retreat upstairs. Aunt May eventually forgives Peter as she loves him like a son and even commends him on being brave enough to finally her the truth. Cliff Robertson returns in a great cameo as Uncle Ben, who represents the better angels of Peter's nature and attempts to persuade him to do the right thing. In a scene inspired by 'Hamlet', Willem Dafoe returns as Norman Osborn, who represents the darkest part of Harry and urges his son to avenge his death. J.K. Simmons is once again brilliant as Jameson and gets the lion's share of the funniest lines. It also features nice appearances from Donna Murphy, Elya Baskin, Elizabeth Banks, Ted Raimi, Dylan Baker, Aasif Mandvi, Bruce Campbell and the one and only Stan Lee.Overall, this is everything that I ever wanted from a Spider-Man film and more.",Null,1,6,17 April 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Very boring
","Hugh Jackman is once again excellent as Wolverine but the whole thing is uninspired. The rest of the cast are (more or less) all either dull or just plain bad. The relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth (who was nowhere near as intimidating as in the first film, which probably means that he works best as a lackey) had the potential to be interesting but it wasn't. Gambit, one of my favourite characters from the 1990s animated series, is wasted in a fairly small role and is played by a bad actor in Taylor Kitsch. I wish that they had kept Brian Cox as Stryker rather than casting Danny Huston. Honestly, Patrick Stewart's 20 second cameo was my favourite part of the film. I suppose that it was competently enough directed but that's hardly anything to write home about. Even Hugh Jackman said that he didn't really like the film.'X-Men: The Last Stand' had a host of problems but a bad cast certainly wasn't one of them. Even the actors with smaller roles in that film, such as Josef Sommer as the President and Shohreh Aghdashloo as Dr. Rao, were very good. In this film, not so much. I mean, will.i.am?I have much the same opinion of this film as I did of 'Terminator Salvation', another poor fourth film in a popular film series released in 2009: full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. However, this was slightly better.",Null,0,2,28 September 2014
Ed Wood," Tim Burton's masterpiece
","An outrageously entertaining and often hilarious tribute to perhaps the worst director of all time. It could also be seen as a tribute to all the little guys in Hollywood who never made it big. Johnny Depp is absolutely fantastic as Ed Wood, whose relentless and infectious optimism, eccentricities and complete acceptance of his friends' many eccentricities make him a lovable protagonist. It's more of a comic retelling of Wood's life and career during the 1950s than an historically accurate biopic and that approach works very well in this case. I thought that it was a wise decision not to make it an outright parody of Wood. I also thought that the use of black and white fitted in perfectly with the film.Martin Landau is brilliant (and almost unrecognisable) in his Oscar winning role as the fallen star Bela Lugosi. Having worked with his idol Vincent Price, I imagine that Burton knew exactly how Wood felt to be working with Lugosi, giving the film a more personal dimension than many of his other ones. The rest of the cast is excellent too, particularly Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge (who played the Ruler in Wood's magnum opus 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'), Patricia Arquette in the fairly small role of Wood's incredibly supportive and understanding girlfriend and eventual wife Kathy O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones as Criswell. Sarah Jessica Parker is surprisingly good as Wood's less supportive previous girlfriend Dolores Fuller, who was reportedly far nicer in real life.The film was a financial flop, making less than a third of its already small budget, but I think that this is Tim Burton's masterpiece. It's one of my top 20 films of all time and my favourite film about films / filmmaking.",Null,1,1,27 August 2014
Terminator Salvation," Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing
","The whole thing is an uninspired mess and makes for a very poor 25th anniversary present for 'Terminator' fans. McG is just not a good director. Arnold Schwarzenegger's absence leaves a void that isn't filled. As I said in my 'Terminator 2' review, he isn't a very good actor but he still makes for an entertaining one in his own way. Plus his deficiencies were more than made up for by the strong supporting cast, particularly in the first two films. In contrast, the cast of this film is generally rather poor. Christian Bale's 'shout acting' is not just bad but very irritating and really quite laughable and his 'badass' voice isn't much better. Sam Huntington, Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood and Common are all either bad or make no impression whatsoever. Anton Yelchin - who actually bears a passing resemblance to Michael Biehn - is better but not by much. None of the characters really have any personalities. As in the marginally better 'Planet of the Apes' (2001), the strongest cast member is Helena Bonham Carter but she's in it for all of five minutes. Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander deserved more screen time as well. I really appreciated Linda Hamilton's voice only cameo as Sarah. However, I think that they missed a trick in not bringing back Earl Boen, the only actor besides Arnie to appear in all of the first three films, as Dr. Silberman.Again like 'Planet of the Apes' (2001), the script had some interesting ideas - Skynet being aware of John Connor and Kyle Reese's importance due to the influence of its own time travelling Terminators from the future, John finally meeting his much younger father, Marcus not realising that he is a hybrid and Skynet taking on a human face to communicate with him - but it seemed like a first draft rather than the finished product. I quite liked the idea of linking into the original film but it wasn't very well executed. I felt that it was the sort of thing that would have been better dealt with it in a tie-in novel or comic book rather than in a film 25 years after the fact. Continuity can sometimes be a double-edged sword in that respect as you don't want to remind people of better films when they're watching your bad one. The fight with the T-800 prototype and Arnie's 'digital cameo' was definitely my favourite part of the film but even that's not great. In spite of my many problems with this film, I'm still looking forward to the fifth one 'Terminator: Genisys' (in spite of its stupid title) as it seems to be taking a 'back to basics' approach with Arnie back in the saddle and, seemingly, the return of time travel to the series with the casting of the 27-year-old Emilia Clarke as Sarah.",Null,0,3,3 September 2014
Spider-Man 3," A rather good film but it is not on the same level as the first two
","The only Sam Raimi 'Spider-Man' film that I did not see in the cinema, this is a rather good film but it is not on the same level as the first two. There are many good ideas to be found in the script by Sam Raimi, his elder brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent and it is quite well written but it is overstuffed. The film is surprisingly well paced considering its somewhat sprawling storyline and the fact that it is the longest of the trilogy. It is well directed by Sam Raimi but the action scenes are generally not the equal of the second film's. Tobey Maguire is again very strong as Peter Parker, who seems to have finally achieved the balance in his life that eluded him for most of the second film. In spite of J. Jonah Jameson's best efforts over the years, the people of New York City have embraced Spider-Man as their hero. When it comes to his personal life, Peter is living the dream as he has been dating Mary Jane Watson for some time and he is planning to propose to her as soon as possible. Kirsten Dunst is good in the role but the material lets her down a bit. Mary Jane is having less success given that her career as a Broadway star died a quick death when she was fired. She thinks that Peter does not understand how she feels and that he tries to make everything about him as he often turns the conversation to his career as Spider-Man. The situation is not helped by the fact that Mary Jane is jealous of him re-enacting their upside down kiss with Gwen Stacy, a young woman whom he recently rescued as Spidey who just so happens to his lab partner as Peter. After a meteorite crashes to Earth, an alien symbiote bonds itself to Peter, amplifying his negative attributes. As the newly black suited Spider-Man, he goes from being a public hero to a public menace. He becomes callous and manipulative and is prone to outbursts of anger and violence. He also changes his image and begins to strut around the streets of New York trying to impress the ladies. These scenes were not really necessary but it was for the best that they were played for laughs. I am far less certain that this was the case when it came to his dancing in the jazz bar, one of the silliest scenes that I have seen in a film of this kind. Whether or not I was supposed to laugh, I did.In the case of the three villains, the one in which I had the most vested interest was Harry Osborn, who discovered his late father Norman's cache of Green Goblin weapons and gadgets and has taken on the mantle of the New Goblin. Much like Dunst, James Franco is good but would have benefited from stronger material. Armed with the knowledge that Peter is Spider-Man, Harry vows to destroy his erstwhile best friend in revenge for the supposed murder of his father. To that end, he attacks Peter in the skies above New York using his glider but falls from a great height and suffers a convenient loss of memory. In the process, he forgets all about Peter's secret life and they resume their friendship, after a fashion. Things go a bit pear-shaped, however, when his memories reassert themselves and he forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter in order to save her boyfriend's life. In contrast to all of the other major villains in the trilogy, I was unfamiliar with Flint Marko / Sandman before I saw the film. Thomas Haden Church is perfectly fine in the role but the character is fairly uninteresting, particularly the clichéd sob story concerning his critically ill daughter. I thought that it was a serious mistake and ultimately rather pointless to retcon Uncle Ben's death so that Marko and not his carjacker accomplice was the culprit. To a certain extent, it detracted from the first film's storyline in a way that a sequel never should. Topher Grace is likewise fine but he does not have much to do as the obnoxious, sleazy and dishonest freelance photographer Eddie Brock who bonds with the symbiote after Peter frees himself from it, becoming Venom. I was pretty disappointed that Venom only had a few major scenes as he was always my favourite villain from the 1990s animated series. I would have been perfectly happy if they had saved Venom for a later installment and jettisoned Sandman altogether so that that the film would have involved a one- on-one confrontation between Peter and Harry, which the end of the second film seemed to be hinting at. I liked the redemption story arc towards the end but more of it would have been nice.As in the previous films, I was very impressed by J.K. Simmons as Jameson and Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. Although his appearance as Uncle Ben is disappointingly brief, the film is notable as being Cliff Robertson's final acting role before his death in 2011. Willem Dafoe's cameo as Norman Osborn was even more evocative of 'Hamlet' than in the second film, considering that he uses the phrase 'Remember me' as did the Ghost of Hamlet's Father. Had 'Spider-Man 4' been produced, I assume that Bryce Dallas Howard would have reprised her role as Gwen Stacy and the character would have been killed off, in line with the comics. James Cromwell was wasted in his brief appearances as her father Captain George Stacy but they probably had plans for him too. As the maître d', Bruce Campbell actually got to be a nice guy to Peter Parker for the only film in the series.Overall, this is an enjoyable film in spite of its flaws but it could have been so much better",Null,1,1,17 April 2016
A Bridge Too Far," Theirs not to reason why, there's but to do and die
","A largely historically accurate depiction of the failed Operation Market Garden, this is a thrilling and engrossing epic war film which explores the absolute necessity of a great deal of preparation in staging a major military operation. Based on the 1974 book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan, it concerns an attempt by the Allied Forces to capture several strategically important bridges in the Netherlands in the hope of breaking the German lines. Had it been successful, it was hoped that World War II in Europe would be over by the end of 1944. However, as Kate ter Horst observes during her opening narration, victory by Christmas was a frequently expressed but seldom achieved hope in many previous wars and, sadly, this one was no different. Almost all of the participants' real names are used and several of them even served as military consultants. The film benefits from an absolutely fantastic script by William Goldman and first rate direction by Richard Attenborough in both the quieter character scenes and the hugely impressive battle scenes. The score by John Addison, himself a veteran of Market Garden appropriately enough, adds a great deal to the film.There are many reasons for the failure of Market Garden but the general consensus among historians seems to be that the major one was that Field Marshal Montgomery's plan was inherently flawed and poorly thought out. Monty is not depicted as a character but there is a great of criticism, albeit most of it implicit, levelled against him throughout the film. In reality, he died the year before the film was released. I imagine that he would have certainly taken issue with it otherwise. What is depicted in the film is an extreme reluctance to question his plan. This is best illustrated when a Cassandra-esque young officer named Major Fuller, played by the great Irish character actor Frank Grimes, is forced to take a leave of absence for 'rocking the boat' when he points out its numerous inconsistencies and elements which are more reminiscent of wishful thinking than sound strategic planning. However, much of the blame in the film is assigned to General Frederick Browning, who is wonderfully played by Dirk Bogarde. He is depicted, very negatively, as an arrogant and shortsighted man who refuses to entertain the suggestion that the plan will not work. At least not until after it has already failed when he comments, in the film's final line, 'Well, as you know, I always felt we tried to go a bridge too far.' Prior to that, Browning took great pride in the fact that the planning and organisation of the operation, the largest airborne offensive ever attempted up to that time, took one week. As the film develops, it becomes clearer and clearer that more time should have been taken in the planning stage. As in reality, it was surprisingly slapdash. All I kept thinking was, 'Someone had blundered / Theirs not to make reply / Theirs not to reason why / Theirs but to do and die.' Like Monty, Browning was dead by 1977 but his widow, the author Daphne du Maurier, unsurprisingly took huge exception to his depiction in the film.The film has an all star cast but Sean Connery probably has the biggest role as Major General Roy Urquhart, the commander of the 1st British Airborne Division which finds itself cut off from the outside world due to useless radios and far fewer jeeps than were promised. This leads to his forces being besieged in Arnhem, the site of the most important bridge, for nine days instead of two. As a result, they suffer an 80% casualty rate. Connery gives a great performance as Urquhart, who becomes increasingly frustrated by the problems besetting his men but manages to keep his cool throughout. Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Colonel John Frost of the 2nd Parachute Battalion. In his first scene, he is depicted as being overly confident as to the prospect of victory as he tells his batman to pack his golf clubs and even his dinner jacket. However, his forces suffer the brunt of the German assaults at the Battle of Arnhem in some of the film's best scenes which unhesitatingly depict the brutality of war.James Caan likewise gives a great performance as Staff Sergeant Eddie Dohun, whose loyalty to his critically wounded superior Captain Glass is touching. The only major cast member who does not speak a word of English in the film, Maximilian Schell is brilliant as General Wilhelm Bittrich of II SS Panzer Corps, who leads the attack on Arnhem. He displays a glimmer of decency when he orders a three hour ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of the wounded. Liv Ullman, the only woman to receive star billing, has very little screen time but she is wonderful as Kate ter Horst, the Dutchwoman who helped care for the wounded. The film also features strong performances from Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Hardy Krüger, Wolfgang Preiss, Robert Redford, Elliott Gould, Christopher Good, Paul Copley, Denholm Elliott and Stephen Moore, among many others in a film with dozens of speaking parts. The weakest link is Ryan O'Neal, who seems a bit lost, while the generally very dependable Gene Hackman's Polish accent leaves a great deal to be desired. Attenborough has a one second cameo as an escaped mental patient, his only appearance in a film that he directed. Unlike many actors turned directors, he clearly had no interest in directing star vehicles for himself.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which does not hesitate to portray the Allies in a less than flattering light. I suspect that this is the reason that, like Attenborough's classic anti-war film 'Oh! What a Lovely War', it was completely ignored by the Oscars. I think that it deserved a Best Picture nomination, again among many others.",Null,10,11,1 August 2015
Sleepy Hollow," A fantastic Tim Burton film
","Another fantastic Tim Burton film, though not on the same level as 'Ed Wood'. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the quirky, eccentric and extremely intelligent Ichabod Crane. I think that he's the best of the sadly very few current Hollywood stars who are worthy of being counted with the greats of yesteryear. Depp leads a very, very talented cast of mostly British actors. I don't really see why Miranda Richardson adopted an American accent when playing both Lady Mary and the old crone though when all of the other established British actors used their natural accents. Conversely, Depp used an English accent while Christina Ricci's had a slightly Mid-Atlantic feel to it. That very minor issue aside, the film is thoroughly entertaining with a wonderfully spooky and often downright scary atmosphere. Gothic horror is the only horror subgenre that I like and this is the most effective example of it that I've seen besides the very best of the Hammer films and the 1931 version of 'Frankenstein'. Tim Burton and 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' is a match made in Heaven. Or should I say Hell?",Null,2,2,28 September 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," An extremely witty and relentlessly entertaining Western comedy-drama
","Inspired by the illegal escapades of the two most famous members of the Wild Bunch, this is an extremely witty and relentlessly entertaining Western comedy-drama. The superb script by William Goldman is full of marvellous dialogue and deservedly won him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. As strong as it is, however, I think that the first half is marginally better than the second. The director George Roy Hill handles the material with a huge amount of energy and flair and he made wonderful use of the locations offered by Utah, Mexico and New Mexico. It is a beautiful looking, stylish film with great cinematography by Conrad Hall. Although the film is based on fact to some degree, it is fictionalised in many places and I am sure that the real Butch and Sundance had quite a few more rough edges than their counterparts. However, any and all liberties that Goldman took with the facts worked in the context of the film. I loved the decision to begin the film with an imitation of silent Westerns while the sepia-tinged opening scene was another great tribute to the filmmaking techniques of days gone by. With the exception of 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head' by Hal David and Burt Bacharach, there is comparatively little music in the film, which was an interesting choice but one that worked well. The film stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford in a pair of wonderful and effortlessly charismatic performances as the titular outlaws. Their chemistry is electrifying and it is a terrible shame that they only made one more film together, namely the even better 'The Sting' which was likewise directed by Hill, as I have seldom seen an on- screen duo who worked better together. I don't know how well they knew each other when they made this film but they click so perfectly that it would be difficult to imagine it working, at least to the same extent, if one or both of them had not been cast. They have a great deal of charm and, even if you're an actor, that is difficult to fake. Of the two, Newman is perhaps the stronger but that may be because he has a marginally more interesting role. Butch, whose real name was the less catchy Robert LeRoy Parker, is depicted as being a warm, affable, eternally optimistic and fiercely intelligent smooth operator with a tendency to plan at least two or three moves ahead. Conversely, Sundance - whose real name of Harry Longabaugh would later be used by Goldman as a pen name - is considerably more laconic, pessimistic and openly cynical than his partner in crime. They have a very interesting relationship as they often snipe at each other but their bickering has a solid foundation in friendship. Each will always have the other's back. In fact, each is probably the best friend that the other ever had. There are times when Sundance looks like he wants to shoot Butch but there is a real sense that he would follow him to Hell and back. Speaking of Sundance, Goldman was not the only one to use his name in later life as Redford founded the Sundance Film Festival in Utah in 1978.The scenes depicting Butch and Sundance's attempt to evade the six man posse are some of the very best in large part because the focus is squarely on the two male leads, giving them a great opportunity to exhibit their easy chemistry. In fact, if the writing had been of the same standard, I'd have been perfectly happy for the remaining hour of the film to consist entirely of nothing but Newman and Redford's banter, though immediately that would not have been very cinematic. The finale in which they are cornered by the Bolivian Army is another highlight. I particularly loved the moment when Butch tells Sundance that they should relocate to Australia in order to continue their criminal careers even though it is obvious that neither of them have much chance of making it nine feet, let alone 9,000 miles. As the exact circumstances of Butch and Sundance's deaths have never been definitively established, an urban legend has arisen that the two men survived and returned to the United States. In an episode of 'In Search Of...' in 1978, the former's much younger sister Lula Parker Bettenson claimed that he came home to Utah and eventually died in 1937 but she refused to disclose where he had been buried. Nothing of this sort has come to light concerning Sundance's supposed later life but, in any event, the evidence of either man surviving that fateful day in Bolivia in 1908 is less than conclusive, to put it mildly.The female lead Katherine Ross is rather boring as Sundance's long- time girlfriend Etta Place but that's okay since, in spite the fact that she is the third most important cast member, her role is not all that crucial to the film. One of Etta's most interesting moments is when she wonders in a wistful tone whether she would have gotten together with Butch if she had met him before Sundance. This suggests that she may have feelings for him but that she remains with Sundance either out of loyalty or because her feelings for him are simply stronger than her ones for Butch. Strother Martin has barely five minute screen time but he is probably the third most entertaining cast member as the self-described 'colourful' mine boss Percy Garris, who gives Butch and Sundance a job when they try to go straight. The film also features nice appearances from Jeff Corey, George Furth, Cloris Leachman, Don Keefer, Kenneth Mars and Ted Cassidy in a rare role outside of the sci-fi, horror and fantasy genres.Overall, this is a hugely entertaining, thrilling film which has given me the impetus to check out more Westerns, which is certainly the Hollywood genre with which I am least familiar.",Null,1,2,30 April 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," A very enjoyable film which embraces its comic book heritage
","The only Marvel Cinematic Universe that I had seen prior to this week, I went to see it at the cinema because I was familiar with Captain America and the Red Skull from their appearances in the 1990s 'Spider-Man' animated series and I remembered them as being rather cool. Watching it again, I did not enjoy quite as much as when I first saw, in part because 'Thor' set the bar very high for MCU films. That said, it is still a very enjoyable film, it has a good script and it is great fun from start to finish. However, it could have been structured a little better as the second half was generally stronger than the first. The film is very well directed by Joe Johnston, who previously directed another (and, for my money, better) period superhero film, namely 'The Rocketeer'.Chris Evans is not as charismatic a leading man or as good an actor as Robert Downey, Jr., Edward Norton or Chris Hemsworth but he is extremely likable as Steve Rogers. At the beginning of the film, we are introduced to him as a sickly and very brave young man who seeks to serve his country by enlisting in the US Army but is repeatedly rejected because of his numerous health problems. He is eventually recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve's super-soldier programme (which was nicely foreshadowed in 'The Incredible Hulk') and the serum transforms him into a superhuman. Steve is a kind, noble, courageous and compassionate man but he is not the most interesting character in the world. In contrast to Tony Stark and Thor, Steve does not really grow as a character over the course of the film as his transformation is purely a physical one. Whether as a man of below average build or a superhuman, he is the same good, decent person, which means that he doesn't really have a character arc. He is most certainly a likable character but there's no real internal struggle as with the characters in the previous films.Hayley Atwell, one of my favourite young actresses working today, gives a great performance as the British agent Peggy Carter, who resembles the film stars of the period with her hairstyle and bright red lipstick. While Jane Foster from 'Thor' is still my favourite MCU leading lady, Peggy is a great character who manages to be a strong woman in both the conventional sense and in the ass kicking sense. On the one hand, she has a sharper mind than most people and doesn't suffer fools gladly. On the other, she is a highly trained agent and a crack-shot rather than merely a damsel in distress. The fact that she is a woman who is very successful in a predominantly male profession at a time when men were far more openly sexist than today means that she is in many respects an outsider. As such, I think that she and Steve can relate to each other better than most people. I'm looking forward to watching her TV series 'Agent Carter' as I think that a great deal more can be done with the character than could be done in a two hour film of which she was not the protagonist.Hugo Weaving is suitably creepy as Johann Schmidt who, interestingly, is only referred to as the Red Skull once in the entire film. He is a great, old-fashioned villain with a requisite plot for world domination. Weaving uses a slightly over the top German accent, something which I actually think worked in the film's favour as it is consistent with its pulp tone. As Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer did to Tony Stark in 'Iron Man 2', Schmidt provides a dark reflection to Steve but this element is not explored as much as I would have liked. Tommy Lee Jones is great as Colonel Phillips and has some very funny lines. Dominic Cooper is quite strong as Tony's father Howard Stark, whom we previously saw as an older man in the aforementioned film. It is interesting to see the seeds of Iron Man being sown more than 60 years before the events of the first film. Sebastian Stan offers great support as Steve's best friend Bucky Barnes and I love the sense of camaraderie and brotherly competition between the two of them. Of the other members of the squad, Neal McDonough and J.J. Feild stood out the most as Dumb Dumb Dugan and James Montgomery Falsworth (who reminded me of actors such as David Niven and Richard Todd in old World War II films). The film also features nice appearances from Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Richard Armitage, David Bradley, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Brandon, Jenna Coleman, Sophie Colquhoun and, in his best cameo yet, Stan Lee.I loved the design of the film as the sets and costumes perfectly recreated the 1940s, even though its tone is more consistent with the World War II of pulp comics and old films than the real thing. Speaking of which, Steve and Peggy's understated romance was the sort of thing that you would find in films of the period while their final conversation is highly reminiscent of Peter Carter and June's first conversation in 'A Matter of Life and Death'. The special effects of the film are very good, the best example being the CGI used to make Evans look like a considerably smaller man in the first half an hour or so.Overall, this is great fun. Of the MCU films that I have seen so far, it seemed to be the most obviously based on a comic book. It's great 'Boy's Own' stuff.",Null,2,4,19 September 2015
Top Secret!," A laugh riot!
","Although I adore 'Airplane!' and the 'Naked Gun' films and the former is one of my top 20 films of all time, I had never even heard of this Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker film until last week when one of its cast members, the always wonderful Warren Clarke, sadly died. The film is a laugh riot from start to finish! In his first film, Val Kilmer is very entertaining and has seldom been more likable or appealing in any of his subsequent films. He leads a very strong cast of mostly British actors including Clarke, Peter Cushing (in his penultimate film role), Michael Gough (who later played Alfred to Kilmer's Batman), Omar Sharif, Jeremy Kemp, Lucy Gutteridge, Ian McNeice, John Sharp and Jim Carter, all of whom excel at their comedic roles played with a completely straight face. The film is an hilarious parody of the films of Elvis Presley (whose ex-wife Priscilla later appeared in the 'Naked Gun' films, funnily enough!), World War II films and Cold War films. My favourite joke in the film is Nigel and Du Quois dressed in a cow costume, which is played by a real cow with black spots painted on it! Outside of its parody elements, the plot is surprisingly good as well. I've seen plenty of straight dramas with more nonsensical plots!",Null,1,2,18 November 2014
The Godfather: Part II," A rare sequel that improves on its absolutely brilliant predecessor in every respect
","One of the best sequels of all time and the only Best Picture winner to be the sequel to a previous one, this film improves on its absolutely brilliant predecessor in every respect. Al Pacino is mesmerising as Michael Corleone and Robert De Niro gives a fantastic performance as his father Vito Corleone in the prequel storyline, which won him his first Oscar. The character was very recognisable as a younger version of the Godfather from the first film but De Niro still managed to put his own stamp on the role. Incidentally, Pacino is one of only two actors to be nominated for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for playing the same character, the other being Barry Fitzgerald who was nominated for both awards for playing Father Fitzgibbon in 'Going My Way'. The writing and direction are once again of an extremely high quality.I've watched nine films which ran 3+ hours long so far this year and this is one of the best structured of those. There is a not a minute that drags. The two story lines are excellent and I loved the depiction of Michael's moral decay. My favourite scene in the film is the extremely powerful one where Kay tells Michael that she is leaving him and she aborted their child when she discovered that it was a boy as she did not want to perpetuate the next generation of Corleones. I think that Diane Keaton deserved a Best Actress nomination for the film. I was surprised that Talia Shire got a Best Supporting Actress one as, while she is excellent as Connie, she has such little screen time. Besides De Niro, the two strongest newcomers were Lee Strasberg - the legendary acting teacher who taught Pacino, De Niro, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, among many others - and Michael V. Gazzo. Both of them were nominated for Best Supporting Actor but lost to De Niro. I thought that Robert Duvall deserved one too as his performance was even better than in the first film but I suppose that they needed to let other films get a look in!",Null,3,4,30 May 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the most intelligent sci-fi action thrillers ever made
","I gave the first film full marks as it works brilliantly on its own merits but this film is on another level entirely. It's one of the best sequels of all time. The action scenes are fantastic and the visual effects were utterly groundbreaking in their day and still hold up remarkably for a film which is almost a quarter of a century old. While the first half of the film is extremely strong, it reaches new heights in the second half with the character development, the Cyberdyne subplot and the spectacular finale in the factory. The turning point is Sarah Connor's dream about the nuclear holocaust, which is my favourite scene in the film.Arnold Schwarzenegger is no Laurence Olivier but the excellent script works around his limitations as an actor and creates a fascinating character in the Terminator, who is far less one note than his counterpart in the first film. He begins as a remorseless killing machine, no better than the T-1000 in that sense, but due to his relationship with John Connor, he develops senses of morality, sympathy and humour and even affection for John. His acting in the final scene is probably the best of his career. Linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor, who has changed almost beyond recognition since the first film and I mean that in the best possible way. It perfectly illustrates the impact that the events of the first film had on her life in a way that many sequels fail to do. When we're first introduced to her, we learn that she stabbed Dr. Silberman in the knee with his pen. Contrast this with the slightly ditzy, disorganised young woman who couldn't balance her cheque book that we met in 'The Terminator'. Edward Furlong plays the crucial role of John Connor very well and he has great chemistry with Arnie. It's a shame that his acting career has floundered in the past decade or so. Robert Patrick is suitably intimidating as the T-1000. Leaving aside shape shifting abilities, he's the only Terminator in the first three films whose baseline appearance actually works as an infiltrator since he's a normal looking person whom you wouldn't look twice at as opposed to Arnie or Kristanna Loken in 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'. Out of the supporting cast, the strongest performers are Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, reprising his role from the first film, and Joe Morton as Miles Dyson. S. Epatha Merkerson, Xander Berkeley and Jenette Goldstein are extremely good in small roles as well.",Null,2,4,2 September 2014
Edward Scissorhands," A very, very close second to 'Ed Wood' as my favourite Tim Burton film
","Johnny Depp is simply wonderful as the title character, whose frightening appearance belies the fact that he is an extraordinarily gentle and sweet young man. It also has a very strong supporting cast. Outside of the first scene, Winona Ryder does not appear until 40 minutes into the film but nevertheless makes for a great leading lady. Kim has a great character arc, going from being terrified of Edward to adoring him. In spite of the fact that this happens over quite a brief period of time, it nevertheless seems very believable due to both the excellent writing and Ryder's performance. Anthony Michael Hall, cast against his previous nice, skinny, nerd type in the John Hughes films, makes for a great villain as Jim. Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin are excellent as Peg and Bill Boggs and I adored Vincent Prince's cameo as the Inventor, which sadly proved to be his final film appearance. The rest of the cast is very good as well, particularly Kathy Baker and Conchata Ferrell. Burton has a great eye for casting. I don't think that anyone in the film gives a bad performance. Actually, I think that is true of all of the five Burton films that I've watched recently except for 'Planet of the Apes'.Part of the reason why I think that the film works so well is that Edward resembles the villain of one of the innumerable slasher films released during the 1980s. Burton and the screenwriter Caroline Thompson completely subvert the audience's expectations of Edward in that respect. Edward is such a compelling character because none of his problems are of his own making: they are all as a result of lies, misunderstandings and accidents. They result in him being completely misjudged by the Boggs' neighbours and thereby call attention to the isolation and discrimination often experienced by those who are different. This sense of isolation is also helped by the contrast between Edward's appearance and the Inventor's dark, murky castle on the one hand and the vibrant yellows, greens, reds, blues and pinks of the neighbourhood on the other hand.",Null,2,3,28 September 2014
Spider-Man," A very good superhero film
","Released in the year of its title character's 40th anniversary, this is a very good superhero film. I have always been much more interested in DC than Marvel so, outside of this film and its first sequel, my familiarity with Spider-Man comes mostly from the 1990s animated series and what I have picked up by osmosis over the years. As such, I'll be reviewing these films on their own merits since that it is all I can do, really. Although there are a few silly moments, the screenplay by David Koepp is generally strong but it could have benefited from sharper characterisation. The relationships are painted in pretty broad strokes. The special effects are impressive for the time and Sam Raimi directs the film with a great deal of flair and energy. My favourite action scene is the Green Goblin's attack on the World Unity Fair but the finale is not quite as exciting as it could have been.The film stars Tobey Maguire in a great performance as Peter Parker, a shy, awkward high school senior who finds that he can do whatever a spider can after he is bitten by a genetically modified - as opposed to radioactive - super-spider. Peter is highly intelligent but lacking in the social graces. He is disliked by most of his peers and is more or less at the bottom of the high school totem pole. When he develops his powers, Peter uses them for selfish purposes such as beating up his seemingly long-time bully Flash Thompson and entering a wrestling competition to win $3,000 to buy a car to impress the love of his life Mary Jane Watson. However, after his beloved uncle Ben Parker is murdered by a thief whom he had refused to stop barely an hour earlier, Peter learns the hard way that Uncle Ben was right when he said, 'With great power comes great responsibility.' The experience motivates him to become New York City's web-slinging protector and he quickly captures the public imagination. Maguire excels with the material which he is given and he is certainly able to convey Peter's social awkwardness and love for Mary Jane very well. However, I would have preferred if more emphasis had been given to the internal conflict that he faces as he tries to rectify his real life and his superhero identity. When it comes to Uncle Ben's death, I felt that we were told rather than shown the impact that it had on Peter.Willem Dafoe is very good as Norman Osborn, the brilliant scientist and industrialist who tests his company's highly experimental super- soldier formula on himself out of desperation. As these things never end well, he is driven insane and becomes the Green Goblin. The Goblin manifests itself as a separate personality. This is very well illustrated in the excellent scene, perhaps the best in the film, in which Osborn 'converses' with the Goblin while looking in the mirror. I really loved this scene as it emphasised that the Goblin is a dark reflection of Osborn's original personality who compels him to do things that he would not be capable of doing on his own. In this respect, the scene reminded me of the more extensive exploration of the concept contained in 'Magic' (1978), in which the ventriloquist Corky Withers regularly talks to his extremely creepy dummy Fats. Unfortunately, the scene in which Osborn speaks to the Green Goblin's mask is nowhere near as effective. A further examination of Osborn's fractured psyche in more scenes along the lines of the mirror scene would have been very much appreciated. Speaking of the mask, I had mixed feelings about it as I loved the look of it but it prevented Dafoe from using any form of facial expression. I did like the fact that Osborn has a distant relationship with his son and Peter's best friend Harry, played well by James Franco. This served as a good contrast to his affection to Peter before he discovers his secret as well as to Peter's bond with Uncle Ben.Kirsten Dunst is good as the very likable Mary Jane and the character is nice and sweet and everything but she doesn't have much of a personality outside of being the Love Interest. Still, she and Maguire have quite good chemistry and some of their scenes were quite touching. The famous upside down kiss is one of the aforementioned silly moments but I do think that it's nevertheless a cool and oddly romantic one. I wasn't really convinced by her relationship with Harry but this was largely because it is underdeveloped, having been inserted merely to provide an obstacle to her and Peter getting together. The film occasionally feels rushed in its second hour and this is the best illustration of that. Unsurprisingly, the great Cliff Robertson does not have much screen time as Uncle Ben but he is excellent in the scene, another of my favourites, in which he tries to impart his wisdom on Peter when it comes to the issue of responsibility. This is really the only time that which Robertson gets the opportunity to shine and it meant that I found Uncle Ben's death scene more affecting that it would have been otherwise. J.K. Simmons has even less screen time but he comes within a hair's breadth of stealing the show with his hilarious performance as the Daily Bugle's loud mouth, obnoxious, Spidey- hating editor-in-chief J. Jonah Jameson. However, I think the character's bark is worse than his bite as he seems to like Peter in spite of his bluster and does not reveal his identity as the photographer to the Green Goblin even when his own life is threatened. Rosemary Harris is good in the fairly thankless role of the supportive Aunt May.Overall, this is a very enjoyable film but it could have been an even better one.",Null,0,1,16 April 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," An absolutely brilliant film
","Not only the best film in the series but one of the best films that I've seen all year. The acting, direction (Bryan Singer is the safest pair of hands imaginable for the series), special effects and script were all brilliant. It is the perfect sequel for both the original trilogy and 'First Class'. I love time travel films - four of my Top 10 films fall into that category - and this is one of the cleverest in many a year. To that end, I loved the intertwining of the past and future towards the end of the film and the wonderful contrasts between Magneto's actions in the two timeframes. The ending of the film was fantastic and I adored the cameos in its final minutes. The post-credits scene certainly whetted my appetite for the next film! It's a shame that I'll have to wait two years for it. This is now second only to 'Superman' as my favourite superhero film. It's everything that I ever wanted from an 'X-Men' film and more.",Null,4,8,28 September 2014
Gandhi," A hugely engrossing and powerful indictment of racism, imperialism, colonialism and violence
","A generally historical accurate account of the life of the Mahatma, this is an absolutely brilliant and hugely engrossing film which acts as a powerful indictment of racism, imperialism, colonialism and violence, political or otherwise. The script by John Briley is beautifully written and full of marvellous dialogue while Richard Attenborough's direction is never less than fantastic. This was Attenborough's dream project and I am delighted that it was such a success, winning him both Best Picture and Best Director. It was the only time that one of his directorial efforts was nominated for either award.As strong as the writing and direction are, the film would not have been nearly as successful had it not been for the casting of Ben Kingsley in the title role. A comparative unknown before the film was released, he plays Gandhi between the ages of 23 and 78 and is never less than mesmerising in the demanding role. Over the course of the film's more than three hour running time, he goes from being an inexperienced young lawyer with no idea of how to handle people to the one of the most revered and respected men in the world. Gandhi is depicted a man of great integrity, humility, courage, compassion, wisdom and intelligence. The strength of Kingsley's performance, which deservedly won Best Actor, means that the audience never doubts why so many Indian people follow him. I suspect that this would be the case even for the admittedly few people who didn't know who Gandhi was before watching the film. However, the script also humanises him when it shows his anger at his wife Kasturba's refusal to clean the latrines in the ashram in South Africa and, decades later, when she tells Margaret Bourke-White that he neglected her in favour of his activism, albeit not in so many words. This behaviour is not exactly admirable but it is very human and I think that the film needed that human dimension to ground its portrayal of Gandhi.In its depiction of South Africa and the British Raj, the film does not pull any punches when it comes to the institutionalised racism that existed in both states. One of the most powerful scenes in the film is the deeply moving and disturbing recreation of the Amritsar massacre of 1919 in which as many of 1,000 men, women and children were killed in the space of barely ten minutes. It is a great illustration of Attenborough's skill as a director. The massacre was easily the worst and most infamous atrocity ever perpetrated by the British Army and is generally considered to be one of the major events which paved the way for Indian independence. One thing that is not depicted in the film is that many in Britain hailed its chief perpetrator General Reginald Dyer and felt that it was necessary to maintain discipline. However, the majority of the British people saw it for what it was, namely mass murder, and Dyer was forced to retire soon afterwards.That said, I think that Gandhi was correct in describing Dyer as an extreme example of the racism which existed towards the Indian people on the part of the British administration, though this is a criticism that could be just as fairly levelled against every colonial power of the day. In spite of such acts of extreme violence, however, Gandhi continually relies on non-violent resistance to obstruct and even shame the administration. While some of his followers suggest the use of violence to achieve their aims, he is appalled by the idea. Jinnah says that he would rather be ruled by an Indian terrorist than an English one when Gandhi and Nehru point out that an Indian campaign of violence would leave them with deeply unsuitable leaders, to put it mildly, if and when India became independent. Unfortunately, this is a lesson which people in many other countries have failed to grasp. Speaking of Jinnah, his extremely unfair depiction as a sneering, sometimes even frightening, villainous figure is certainly the largest historical accuracy in the film. In this respect, I think that the filmmakers knew what side their bread was buttered on as a third of the budget was provided by the Indian government, then led by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, through the National Film Development Corporation of India.As he always did, Attenborough was able to assemble an excellent cast in roles of varying size: Rohini Hattangadi as Kasturba Gandhi, Roshan Seth as Nehru, Saeed Jaffrey as Sardar Patel, Alyque Padamsee as Jinnah (I can't fault his performance, even if the character is not depicted accurately), Ian Charleson as Charlie Andrews, Candice Bergen as Margaret Bourke-White, John Mills as Lord Chelmsford, John Gielgud as Lord Irwin (better remembered as Lord Halifax, who had a left hand in the film but not in reality), Martin Sheen as Vince Walker (the only notable fictional character), Edward Fox as General Dyer, Trevor Howard as Lord Broomfield, Athol Fugard as General Smuts, Günther Maria Halmer as Dr. Hermann Kallenbach (who doesn't seem to age in 50 years!) and Geraldine James as Mirabehn (who died only four months before the film was released). It was features great appearances in smaller roles from Michael Hordern, Richard Vernon, John Savident, a very young Daniel Day-Lewis, the director's brother-in-law Gerald Sim, Amrish Puri, Terence Hardiman, Nigel Hawthorne, Richard Griffiths, Bernard Hill, Ian Bannen and Shane Rimmer. Attenborough had such a great eye for casting.Overall, this is a wonderful epic film which deservedly swept the boards at the Oscars in 1983. While it is not my favourite Attenborough film since I preferred both 'Oh! What a Lovely War' and 'A Bridge Too Far', it is one of my favourite biopics and historical films. A triumph for all concerned.",Null,0,0,13 September 2015
Quantum of Solace," A very disappointing follow-up to 'Casino Royale'
","Unfortunately, Daniel Craig's second film as Bond does not come anywhere close to matching the quality of his first. He is as impressive as he was in 'Casino Royale' but this film's script is very uninspired and just plain boring. While 'The Man with the Golden Gun', 'A View to a Kill' and 'Die Another Day' were all worse, I thought that this was the most boring Bond film since 'Thunderball'. The title may come from an Ian Fleming story but it's still a very dull one.Mathieu Almaric is a good actor who is saddled with an uninteresting character in the form of Dominic Greene. In comparison to other main Bond villains, he has no distinguishing characteristics in terms of his personality or characterisation. He may be ruthless and amoral but that's nothing we haven't seen before. His evil scheme is rather uninteresting and straightforward, offering few real surprises. The Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko may have an odd choice to play the Bolivian agent Camille Montes but she is quite impressive in the role. However, her character is far too derivative of Melina Havelock in 'For Your Eyes Only' on the one hand and Wai Lin in 'Tomorrow Never Dies' on the other. She likewise offers nothing new and the female agent character type – which it is rather overused at this stage – has done better in previous films. Admittedly, it's been done worse too! As in 'Die Another Day', the film was going very well and was classic Bond until the female lead showed up but the turn for the worse wasn't their fault. Judi Dench is as effortlessly excellent as ever but the material that she was given wasn't up to standard. However, the fact that the maternal undertones from the last film have become overtones was interesting and I liked that she gradually develops greater trust in Bond. Again, the standout supporting actor is Giancarlo Giannini as René Mathis and he once again plays the role with great charm. I think that it was a serious, serious mistake to kill the character off as he could have contributed so much more to future Bond films but his death scene is by far the best in the film and the most poignant death of any male ally in the series' history. Gemma Artertron gets my vote as the most boring Bond girl ever as Strawberry Fields, though I quite liked the 'Goldfinger' reference with her death. As in the previous film, Jesper Christensen and Jeffrey Wright were very good as Mr White and Felix Leiter respectively but were given far too little to do. I hope that they both return in Bond 24 with more to do. Rory Kinnear is good as Bill Tanner but he's no Michael Kitchen. Of all the actors in smaller roles, the always entertaining Tim Piggott-Smith as the Foreign Secretary was the only one who made an impression on me. Sometimes older actors with presence can help lift parts of a lacklustre film and Dench, Giannini, Christensen and Piggott-Smith were able to do so on this occasion. Overall though, this film was one of the weakest casts of any Bond film. I quite liked the music but it didn't set the world on fire. Outside of Bond chasing Mitchell in the early part of the film, the action scenes were as uninspired as many of the characters.",Null,2,4,20 July 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Very disappointing
","It has some excellent moments and looks amazing but it's rather underwhelming overall and suffers from more structuring problems than the previous four films combined. It's very badly paced, I'm afraid. As with those four films, I watched the extended version but I wish that I hadn't as it feels incredibly bloated. It's very difficult to justify its three hour running time. My attention began to wane after about 1 hour and 45 minutes, something which never happened at all during the four hour version of 'The Return of the King'. While watching that film, I had to drag myself away from the screen to go to the bathroom. While watching this one (after the two hour mark), I often thought, 'Is it not over yet?' Much of it feels like a 'greatest hits' film. 'Desolation' was a good word to put in the title but, sadly, not for the reason that they intended.Even Smaug's first proper appearance is underwhelming and things don't get better from there. I wish that they had picked a good actor with the better voice instead of the irritating man of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch. In fairness to him though, he isn't anywhere near as hilariously awful as he was in another disappointing (though far, far worse) 2013 film, 'Star Trek Into Darkness'. Christopher Lee wanted to play Smaug and I wish that he had. Speaking of Lee, the film could have benefited from his appearance as well as from significantly more screen time for Ian McKellen and Sylvester McCoy.",Null,2,5,17 January 2015
Before Sunset," It's not on the same level as 'Before Sunrise' but it's still better than 90-95% of 21st Century films
","The writing and acting are once again remarkable. Julie Delpy is enchanting and phenomenal as Céline. The film takes place nine years after the events of 'Before Sunrise' and begins with Jesse being interviewed about his novel 'This Time', which was inspired by his encounter with Céline on 16 June 1994. A journalist asks him if the book was autobiographical. In this scene, Jesse was serving as a stand-in for the director and co-writer Richard Linklater since, as I mentioned in my review of the first film, it was based on his encounter with a woman in 1989. The line is also significant as Jesse's marital problems reflect those of Ethan Hawke, who was in the process of divorcing Uma Thurman at the time that the film was made.Many of the things that I loved about this film are the same as those that I loved about 'Before Sunrise' so I won't repeat myself. One thing that I loved about this film in particular was the brilliant exploration of how Jesse and Céline had changed over the course of the last nine years, for better and for worse, and the ways in which their experiences in the first film affected them, again for better and for worse. In the first film, it was left ambiguous as to whether or not they had sex. In this film, that ambiguity was eliminated, which was my only disappointment with either film as I loved that. However, it is an incredibly minor thing and, given how much time they spend talking about sex in the film, it would have been farcical if they didn't discuss what happened that night.",Null,1,2,16 November 2014
The Elephant Man," An excellent, thought-provoking and moving film about the triumph of the human spirit over adversity
","Based in part on Frederick Treves' 1923 memoirs 'The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences', this is an excellent, thought-provoking and moving film about the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. I think that the film is reasonably historically accurate, with one of the bigger inaccuracies being that Merrick's first name was Joseph rather than John. For some odd reason that has never been explained, Treves always referred to him as 'John' even though Merrick's name was recorded as 'Joseph' and he referred to himself as such. The script by David Lynch, Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren is wonderful and the same is true of Lynch's direction. The black-and-white cinematography of Freddie Francis, otherwise best known as a horror film director, is beautiful and greatly adds to the atmosphere of the film. Much of the film's success, however, lies in the fantastic make-up of Christopher Tucker, which led directly to the establishment of a long overdue Academy Award for Best Makeup, albeit too late for this film to benefit from it.As the title character, John Hurt gives an absolutely brilliant performance. A sufferer from what is now believed to be either neurofibromatosis type I or Proteus syndrome, Merrick's severe deformities meant that he was exhibited in the freak show of the cruel Mr. Bytes, played very well and against type by Freddie Jones. It is not mentioned in the film but in reality he was in a workhouse for several years beforehand, which would have been a dreadful experience for anyone, let alone someone in his condition. Merrick is assumed to have limited mental capacities. However, he surprises everyone when it is revealed that he can not only read and write but is extremely intelligent. He is a kind, unfailingly polite and gentle soul who soon develops a passion for art and the theatre. Merrick's good manners and easy charm mean that he is able to win over most people who are initially frightened or even disgusted by his appearance. My favourite scene in the film is the one in which he has tea with Treves and his wife Ann, played in a great cameo by Hannah Gordon, and she is deeply moved by his sensitive nature and his photograph of his beloved and beautiful mother. It is impossible for me to imagine what kind of life he led or how he felt but the film depicts him as a very brave man who lived his life with a quiet dignity once he was given the opportunity to do so. When I saw Hurt speak in UCD in 2009, he said that the make-up was so claustrophobic that he could only work on alternating days and it is easy to see why. This may also be the reason that Merrick does not appear until 14 minutes into the film and does not speak for the first 40 minutes. Hurt was deservedly nominated for Best Actor for his performance - for the only time, incidentally - but he lost to Robert De Niro in 'Raging Bull'.Although Merrick is the focus of the film, the protagonist is arguably the renowned surgeon Frederick Treves, who rescues him from Bytes' freak show and admits him to the London Hospital. Anthony Hopkins, who is credited first and has more screen time than Hurt, is excellent in the role. At first, he is interested in Merrick merely as a medical curiosity and exhibits him before other members of his profession as such. In that sense, it is little different from Bytes exhibiting him in his freak show. It just has more of a veneer of sophistication. Over time, particularly after realising the extent of his intelligence, Treves grows genuinely fond of him and he becomes the first true friend that he ever had. After Merrick becomes the darling of London society, however, Treves begins to wonder whether he is really any better than Bytes as his reputation and career have profited significantly from showing the Elephant Man off to people. In reality, this is a criticism that has been levelled against Treves and I agree with it to some extent. However, I also think that he did more good than harm and gave Merrick a better quality of life than he would ever have had otherwise, even if his motives were not entirely altruistic.As was his wont, John Gielgud gives a superb performance as Francis Carr-Gomm, the governor of the London Hospital who is initially opposed to Merrick's presence but eventually grows to care for him. The same is true of his fellow stalwart of the British stage and screen Wendy Hiller as the head nurse Mrs. Mothershead. I suppose that Anne Bancroft (whose husband Mel Brooks produced the film) is officially the female lead but she only has three scenes. In any event, she is excellent as the Victorian actress Madge Kendal. In real life, Mrs. Kendal was childhood friends with Kate and Ellen Terry, two other celebrated actresses of the day who just so happened to be Gielgud's grandmother and great-aunt. On a similar note, Frederick Treves' great-nephew of the same name makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the film as an alderman. Lesley Dunlop is very good as Merrick's loving nurse Nora and Michael Elphick is suitably vile as the night porter Jim who, in the most disturbing scene, leads a bunch of drunks and prostitutes into Merrick's hospital room to torment him. The film also features nice appearances in small roles from Helen Ryan (reprising her role as Princess Alexandra from the ITV serial 'Edward the Seventh'), John Standing, W. Morgan Sheppard, Kenny Baker, David Ryall and a very young Dexter Fletcher.Overall, this is a brilliant film which reminds the audience of the importance of not judging a book by its cover. The final scene in particular is very powerful.",Null,1,1,31 December 2015
The Longest Day," A thrilling and engrossing epic war film
","A largely historically accurate account of D-Day, one of the most important single days of the 20th Century, this is a thrilling and engrossing epic war film of a kind which is sadly not made anymore. Based on the 1959 book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan, it is a stirring tribute to the resourcefulness and bravery of the Allied strategists and combatants who ensured that Operation Overlord was a success. While it only covers the events leading up to the invasion and those of June 6, 1944 itself as to opposed to the rest of the campaign, there is a sense of 'a lot done, more to do' as the film draws to a close. The film may be over but the war certainly isn't.The film benefits from a very strong script and is extremely well directed by all concerned in both the quieter character scenes and the wonderfully shot battle scenes. In spite of its multiple directors, the tone of the film is very consistent and, had I not known already from my previous viewing, I would assumed that there had only been one director. The fact that all of the German and French characters speak their own languages rather than English also gives the film a great sense of authenticity. The film is extremely well paced and there was not a minute where I was bored. On the Allied side, D-Day was chiefly depicted from the British and American perspectives but I did like that there was an acknowledgement of some of the other forces involved such as the Canadians, the Free French and the Free Polish. Still, they could have done more with it.There is a terrific sense of tension in the early scenes in which the Allied Forces are waiting to receive the word from General Eisenhower to launch the invasion in spite of the worst weather in the English Channel in 20 years. Eventually, it is decided to give the order as the conditions were unlikely to improve any time soon. There was talk of Eisenhower playing himself in the film but it was decided that he looked too old. The same was true of David Niven. I can't say that I'd really have cared in either case! The prelude to the invasion is also examined from the German perspective with Field Marshals Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt, played very well by Werner Hinz and Paul Hartmann respectively, being dismissive of the prospects of invasion due to the poor weather conditions and are consequently caught unawares when it does come. On the German side, the strongest response to the invasion comes from Generals Max Pemsel and Günther Blumentritt, both of whom served as consultants on the film as did Frau Rommel, among others. They were also lucky enough to be played by the two best German actors in the film: Wolfgang Preiss and Curd Jürgens. Preiss later played von Rundstedt himself in 'A Bridge Too Far', incidentally.The film has a very big cast which reads like a 'Who's Who' of 1960s male film stars and almost all of them get a chance to shine. Richard Burton has a great cameo as the RAF pilot David Campbell, distraught at the death of the only other remaining member of his squadron from the Battle of Britain. He later turns up towards the end of the film after being shot down the previous night. Richard Beymer plays a cocky young private named Dutch Schultz who wins $2,500 gambling as he is waiting to be deployed. However, he has the reality of the situation brought home when he receives rosary beads from his mother. Cast against type, Red Buttons is excellent as Private John Steele, who was trapped on the church tower of Sainte-Mère-Église after his parachute became caught. Robert Mitchum has one of the more substantial roles in terms of screen time as General Norman Cota and gives a great performance as a general who cares about all of the men under his command. Henry Fonda, my favourite actor in the film, has a smaller role as General Teddy Roosevelt, Jr., who lead his troops onto Utah Beach in spite of his severe arthritis and died of a heart attack the following month. Jeffrey Hunter is very good as Sgt. (later Lt.) John H. Fuller, who does not survive the day sadly.At 55, John Wayne, who probably had the biggest role overall, was twice as old as his character Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort was on D-Day but he is nevertheless more suited to the role than he was to that of Genghis Khan in 'The Conqueror', the last film that I saw him in. He was certainly not a very good actor but he had a likable screen presence in most of his films and this one was no different. That said, the anguish on his face when he sees the bodies of parachutists who were shot down while attempting to land in Sainte-Mère-Église was the best acting that I have ever seen from him. In a case of art imitating life, D-Day veteran Richard Todd plays his erstwhile superior officer Major John Howard and took part in the assault on Pegasus Bridge as he did in reality. Other than those actors that I have already mentioned, I was impressed by Richard Münch as General Ernst Marcks (who turned 53 on D-Day but did not have a great birthday), Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Hans Christian Blech, Peter van Eyck, Roddy McDowall, Mel Ferrer, Rod Steiger, Edmond O'Brien, Kenneth More, Peter Lawford, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, Georges Wilson, André Bourvil and Irina Demick, who has the best role of any woman in the film as the French Resistance member Janine Boitard.Overall, this is an excellent war film which was deservedly nominated for Best Picture. It may not be on quite the same level as its companion piece 'A Bridge Too Far' but it's not far behind either.",Null,3,5,25 August 2015
Sing Street," An absolutely brilliant coming of age film which is at turns hilarious, life-affirming and thought-provoking
","Taking place in Dublin in 1985, this is an absolutely brilliant coming of age film which is at turns hilarious, life-affirming and thought-provoking. It has a superb script by John Carney which hits all of the right notes and his direction is certainly up to the task. The film has an excellent soundtrack featuring various styles of music from the period such as the Cure, the Clash, A-ha, Duran Duran, the Jam, Spandau Ballet and Joe Jackson as well as original compositions written by Carney, Gary Clark, Glen Hansard and others. However, in spite of the fact that it was likewise written for the film, 'Go Now' by Adam Levine seemed like a somewhat awkward fit as it sounded more 2010s than 1980s. The film paints a convincing portrait of dysfunctional families, some of which are considerably more dysfunctional than others. It perfectly captures the essence of 1980s Ireland, which was not exactly a land of opportunity. Actually, Ireland has never been a land of opportunity.The film stars Ferdia Walsh-Peelo in a very good performance as Conor Lalor, a 15-year-old boy who is pulled out of his posh, fee paying Jesuit run school (presumably either Belvedere or Gonzaga) and forced to attend the rough innercity school Synge Street CBS due to the fact that his family is having serious financial problems. Walsh-Peelo is very impressive in his first film role, let alone his first leading role, but he is an even better musician. Incidentally, his elder brother Tadhg was in my year in law at UCD. I don't recall ever actually speaking to him but he always seemed like a nice guy. As Conor's parents Robert and Penny's marriage is rapidly deteriorating, his home life is far from ideal. He finds comfort in his love of music. Considering that his new school has a very different atmosphere from his old one, it is not a smooth transition. In his first week, he is targeted by both the school bully Barry Bray and the sadistic headmaster Brother Baxter, who objects to the fact that he is wearing brown shoes in contravention of the strict black shoe policy. After he meets a 16-year-old model named Raphina, Conor tells her that he just so happens to be looking for a model to be in his band's first music video. The only problem is that he does not really have a band. Thankfully, Conor has made his first friend at the school in the form of a budding entrepreneur named Darren Mulvey, who agrees to manage the band and introduces him to the eccentric rabbit enthusiast Eamon who can reportedly 'play every instrument known to mankind.'Lucy Boynton is extremely strong as Raphina, a seemingly strong, confident girl who uses her air of mystery and sophistication to mask her vulnerability and inner pain. The band's first original song 'The Riddle of the Model' concerns the perception that people become less interesting the more that you learn about them as anything is initially possible (at least in your head). However, Raphina becomes more and more interesting as we learn more about her. She is without a doubt the film's strongest and most memorable character. Raphina dreams of moving to London to start her career as a model, in large part because she desperately wants to escape her often traumatic life in Ireland. Her mother is a manic depressive who is in and out of hospital while her father, a drunkard, was killed in a car accident a few years earlier. In the film's most heart-breaking, gut-wrenching moment, Raphina tells Conor – albeit not in so many words – that her father sexually abused her. As a result, he gains a new insight into not only Raphina but his own situation as he realises that his home life is nowhere near as bad as it could be. In comparison to many other teen films, Conor and Raphina's relationship is unusual in that it never goes beyond kissing. In that sense, it is very pure and sweet and, as such, it serves as an effective contrast to Raphina's serious personal problems. I think that Conor means so much to Raphina in part because he is one of the few people in her life who has not taken advantage of her, one way or another.Conor's extremely close relationship with his elder brother Brendan, played very well by Jack Reynor, is just as important to the storyline as his relationship with Raphina. Brendan offers a great deal of valuable advice on both musical and romantic matters. A college dropout, he initially appears to be the stereotypical Generation X stoner and pop philosopher but Carney expertly deconstructs the stereotype by revealing that he regrets his wasted potential. As much as he loves Conor, he is clearly envious of him to some degree as he is the golden boy in the family but he eventually gets over it. Ben Carolan is an absolute laugh riot as Darren, who gets all of the funniest lines and delivers them impeccably. There is an inspired comic moment when he suggests getting Ngig, the school's sole black student, to join the band for the sole reason that it would look cool to have a black guy in the line-up. Mark McKenna is very good as Eamon, Conor's writing partner who becomes his best friend. Aidan Gillen, the best known actor in the film in or out of Ireland, and Maria Doyle Kennedy are excellent as Conor's parents Robert and Penny. The same is true of Don Wycherly as the film's main antagonist Brother Baxter, who physically assaults Conor in a very powerful scene. Ian Kenny is perfectly cast as Barry who, like Raphina, Brendan and Penny, is a far more complicated character than he appears at first glance.Overall, this is an excellent film which is just as effective in its character development as in its treatment of music.",Null,2,3,5 July 2016
Thor," An excellent and thrilling superhero film wonderfully directed by Kenneth Branagh
","Although I had never even heard of the comic version of Thor before the film was released, I was looking forward to this more than any other film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it was directed by my favourite living director Kenneth Branagh. He may not be the first name that springs to mind to direct a comic book special effects extravaganza but he was the perfect choice given the film's Shakespearean themes. It may be an atypical Branagh film as it was really his first truly mainstream one since 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' in 1994 but his direction is typically brilliant in both the quieter character moments and the hugely impressive action sequences, which were a bit of a departure for him. The film has an extremely strong script which is full of wit and great dialogue. This is certainly my favourite MCU film so far.In his first leading role, Chris Hemsworth gives an excellent performance as the title character. At the beginning of the film, Thor is an arrogant, short-tempered, impulsive crown prince who fails to appreciate or even consider the consequences of his actions, a character trait which leads him to disobey his father Odin and attack the Frost Giants at Jotunheim. A furious Odin strips Thor of his powers and banishes him to Earth as a mortal as punishment. During his exile on Earth, he becomes a better man as he learns humility and sees the folly of his ways. He has a great character arc as we are able to see him grow and change over the course of the film. Tom Hiddleston is wonderful as his adoptive and treacherous brother Loki, who is extremely jealous of Thor and has a major chip on his shoulder as a result. He presents himself as the honest, responsible, dutiful son but, in reality, he is far from it. Speaking of Shakespeare, Loki bears many similarities to Edmund from 'King Lear' and Iago from 'Othello', both of whom manipulate those around them with ease. The climactic battle between Thor and Loki reminded me of Edmund's duel with Edgar. They also reminded me of the depiction of Moses and Rameses in 'The Ten Commandments' as they are likewise a pair of princes, one of whom is adopted, who are in conflict over which of them will succeed their royal father.Anthony Hopkins may have relatively little screen time as Odin but he brings his considerable talent to bear as the All-Father of Asgard. He loves his two sons but has a difficult relationship with both of them. While I thankfully have a very close relationship with my dad, I have always been fascinated by this sort of father-son relationship and Hopkins, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are all very effective in portraying it. Natalie Portman is very good as Jane Foster and has great chemistry with Hemsworth. In contrast to Pepper Potts in the 'Iron Man' films, Jane is a very strong character. She is extremely intelligent, capable, resourceful, brave, imaginative and is not afraid to stand up for herself. She is a great source of love and support to Thor but she is also a character in her own right and contributes a great deal to the plot. To a large extent, Jane's good influence is what allows Thor to become a better man, something which I did not think was true of Pepper as regards Tony Stark even if that was what they were going for. Stellan Skarsgård gives a great performance as Jane's initially sceptical colleague Erik Selvig, who loves Jane like a father and does not want to see her get hurt by Thor. Kat Dennings is a laugh riot as Jane's assistant Darcy Lewis and has many of the funniest lines in the film. Clark Gregg has a bigger role as Agent Coulson ('Son of Coul') on this occasion but the character is still pretty much devoid of a personality. The film also features great appearances in smaller roles from Colm Feore as Laufey, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Jaimie Alexander as Sif and Rene Russo as Frigga. Oh, and I adored J. Michael Straczynski's cameo! The action scenes are very exciting, particularly the battles with the Frost Giants at Jotunheim and with the Destroyer in New Mexico. Visually speaking, it is an extraordinarily well designed film. I loved the sets and the costumes. Asgard seems as if it could be a real place, which I think is very important in a film like this. The Destroyer is fantastic. The film has the best special effects that I have seen in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so far. It also has a great score by Branagh's regular composer Patrick Doyle, who unusually does not have a role in the film. In fact, none of Branagh's regular stock company such as Richard Briers, Brian Blessed and Richard Clifford appear in the film, though Feore and Skarsgård later appeared in 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and 'Cinderella' respectively.Overall, this is an excellent film which I am glad to say that I enjoyed even more than I anticipated. Except for 'Peter's Friends', I have to yet to see a Branagh film that I did not love. However, even that film was very well written, acted and directed. Its very depressing storyline was just not to my tastes. It is a shame that Branagh did not return to direct 'Thor: The Dark World'.",Null,3,4,19 September 2015
The Godfather: Part III," A dull and pointless sequel
","After its two excellent predecessors, this is bitterly disappointing. None of the various story lines are terribly interesting and I think that the kissing cousins plot was a dreadful idea. The best parts of the film are the scenes between Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, who play the tense relationship between Michael and Kay very well, but their performances are not on the same level as in the first two films. This would not have been a major problem if the film had been better but it places far too much reliance on the previous films to the point that it is difficult to fully understand or even care about the characters and events if you are not familiar with them. I wasn't very interested in the idea of Michael's quest for redemption but could have been handled far better. The film was nominated for Best Picture but I don't think that it deserved to be. It felt more like someone else trying to emulate the 'Godfather' films than a true 'Godfather' film itself. For instance, the intertwining of the killings with the opera performance was a failed attempt to recreate the brilliant baptism scene of the first film. At 2 hours and 50 minutes, it was far too long and very badly paced. Honestly, my favourite line in the film is when Joey Zasa says, 'And we got Don Ameche, who played the guy that invented the telephone' since Ameche is one of my all time favourite actors.The best newcomers are the always brilliant Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna and Donal Donnelly. George Hamilton and Bridget Fonda are wasted. Robert Duvall's absence is extremely noticeable and Andy Garcia, who is not a very good actor, is just forgettable as Vincent. Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone is pretty horrific but much of the blame has to be attributed to her father Francis Ford Coppola for casting her. He should have been able to see that she could not act to save her life. One of her lines - delivered atrociously - is 'Dad, why are you doing this to me?' I'd have said the same thing in real life if I were her. Coppola's well known propensity for nepotism proved successful in the casting of his sister Talia Shire in this trilogy - she has more screen time in this film than the first two combined but far less interesting material, incidentally - and his nephew Nicolas Cage in 'Peggy Sue Got Married'. However, after Winona Ryder dropped out of this film, it would have probably been a good idea if he looked for an actress outside of his immediate family to replace her. Overall, this is not a dreadful or even a particularly bad one. It's just dull. However, I don't think that this is a film that needed to be made. This is the weakest final entry in a film trilogy that I have ever seen. It's certainly for the best that 'The Godfather Part IV' was never made.",Null,9,11,30 May 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a wonderful film
","Based on the 1945 short story 'The Greatest Gift' by Philip Van Doren Stern, this is a quintessential Christmas classic that I never saw before today. It is not only a wonderful life but a wonderful film. Its excellent script by Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett and Frank Capra chronicles the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. The film serves as a reminder that the most important thing in life is other people and that no one is truly a failure so long as they have friends, which is the perfect Christmas message. I had never previously seen one of Capra's films but I was very much impressed by his direction and his superb handling of the material. I was expecting to love the film as I'm a big softie who loves old, sentimental films but I loved it even more than I thought I would.The film stars Jimmy Stewart in perhaps his best performance as George Bailey, a much loved institution in the small town of Bedford Falls who is contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve 1945. We are introduced to George as a 12-year-old boy in 1919 when he saves his younger brother Harry from drowning after he falls through the ice. In the process, he loses the hearing in his left ear, something which becomes symbolic of the sacrifices that he makes for others. For many years, he entertains the dream of exploring Europe and South America in order to escape the monotony of Bedford Falls where everyone knows everyone else. Over the years, he displays his propensity for selflessness time and time again. His dream dies a death and he never leaves home. On that fateful Christmas Eve, he comes to believe that he has accomplished nothing in his life. Thankfully, however, he is proved wrong after he wishes that he had never been born. Without knowing it, he has single-handedly prevented the town and many of its inhabitants from falling into darkness and despair. George is a great character who, in spite of being a thoroughly decent man, is not perfect as he falls victim to the same depression that anyone else in his position on Christmas Eve 1945 would. He thinks of himself before others but these scenes serve to humanise him. Except for Henry Fonda and Gregory Peck if he were a few years older, I don't think that anyone other than Stewart could have played this role so well.Donna Reed is excellent as George's incredibly loyal, supportive and understanding wife Mary Hatch Bailey, who has harboured a crush on him from the time that they were children. Although George initially does not seem to be interested in her and tells her that he never wants to get married, he realises that he is in love with her. Mary is a kind, somewhat shy woman who is a perfect partner for George. They are like two peas in a pod. She tells George that she would have ended up an old maid without him and this is proved to be the case in the reality where George was never born. I think that Mary could have easily married someone else in the other reality as I am sure that she would had her fair share of suitors but George was the only man for her and she was the only woman for him. Crucially, Stewart and Reed have great chemistry. The scene in which George and Mary are listening to the phone while standing very close together is one of the best romantic scenes that I have ever seen in a film. It is so simple but it works so well. Lionel Barrymore is suitably vile as Bedford Falls' wealthiest and most immoral citizen Henry F. Potter, a 'warped, frustrated old man' who sees the Baileys as a thorn in his side. Consistent with the film's thematic links to 'A Christmas Carol', Mr. Potter is similar to Scrooge prior to his redemption but I found him to be even more despicable. He is a great film villain who almost succeeds in crushing George's spirit, telling him that he is worth more dead than alive. He is not seen in the other reality but he has gained control of the town and has renamed it Pottersville, turning it into a den of iniquity. Henry Travers has very little screen time but he is fantastic as George's eccentric, whimsical guardian angel Clarence Odbody. His manner serves as a very effective contrast to George's depression before he realises that he has a great deal to live for. The film also features great performances from Thomas Mitchell as the sweet but scatterbrained Uncle Billy Bailey, H.B. Warner as Mr. Gower, Frank Faylen as Ernie Bishop, Gloria Grahame as Violet Bick and Todd Karns as Harry Bailey. It also features small appearances from Charles Lane, Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer and the future television producer Sheldon Leonard.Overall, this is a sublime film which shows that one man can make more of a difference to the lives of others than he ever through possible. I have to admit that I cried at the end. I honestly cannot remember the last time that I cried because of a film and I have watched over 500 in less than two years. I plan to watch this every Christmas season from now on. There is talk of a sequel in which Karolyn Grimes will reprise her role as George's daughter Zasu (now a guardian angel herself) but, since it is unlicensed, it is unlikely to materialise. In any event, I would not be terribly interested. Without Jimmy Stewart, what's the point?",Null,3,6,21 December 2015
Downfall," A hugely engrossing, powerful and thoughtful treatment of the material
","Released under the title 'Downfall' in the English speaking world, this is a hugely engrossing film about the last ten days of Hitler's life, the fall of Berlin to the Red Army and the end of the Second World War in Europe. The excellent script by Bernd Eichinger is based on a variety of historical sources, many of them primary ones, and hues closely to the actual events of April and May 1945. Oliver Hirschbiegel's direction is superlative in both the quieter character moments and the appropriately brutal, uncompromising and often disturbingly violent battle scenes. Given the subject matter, it is interesting to note that much of the film was shot in St. Petersburg.In the role of Adolf Hitler, Bruno Ganz is phenomenal and never less than absolutely compelling, whether he is being tender towards his companions in the bunker or spewing hatred for the Jews. The film endeavoured to make the dictator as three-dimensional and human as possible and it fully succeeded in this. Some criticised the film for this approach but it is important to remember that Hitler was human and not an alien or a demon or one of Frankenstein's creations. The British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, one of the leading experts on Hitler and the Third Reich in general, had this to say on the matter and I think that this says it best: 'Hitler was, after all, a human being, even if an especially obnoxious, detestable specimen. We well know that he could be kind and considerate to his secretaries, and with the next breath show cold ruthlessness, dispassionate brutality, in determining the deaths of millions.' His secretary Traudl Junge says almost exactly that in the film, which continually emphasises his crimes and his complete disregard for human life. In the final days of his life, Hitler was a pathetic, increasingly unstable figure but the film does not want us to pity him and I most certainly didn't.Alexandra Maria Lara is excellent as Traudl Junge, who is depicted as a good person who finds herself in the midst of a dreadful situation which is far beyond her control and perhaps her understanding. She has a misplaced sense of loyalty to Hitler but she is not a true Nazi and she is extremely uncomfortable whenever he engages in one of his anti-Semitic tirades. The film is bookended by interviews with the real Traudl Junge, in which she discusses her inability to forgive herself for her involvement in the regime and the fact that her being young and naive did not absolve her as Sophie Scholl was the same age and resisted the Nazis. These interviews are crucial to our understanding of Frau Junge, who is depicted as a very sympathetic and quite a vulnerable character. However, I felt the greatest sympathy for the children, both the members of the Hitler Youth who were so deluded that they thought that they could actually make a difference in the Battle of Berlin and the six Goebbels children who were murdered by their frighteningly fanatical parents so they would not grow up in a world with Nazism. Their eldest child, Helga, was twelve at the time of her death and was the only one to realise that their parents intended to kill them. Her attempts to resist are particularly harrowing. The Goebbels children's death scene is the most disturbing and upsetting in the entire film.Juliane Köhler gives a fantastic performance as Eva Braun, who arranges a party for Hitler's birthday in a textbook example of fiddling while Rome burns. However, her forced grins seems to hide an inner misery as at one point she admits that she hardly even knows Hitler after 15 years. The film has a very strong cast overall such as Thomas Kretschmann (probably the best known cast member in the English speaking world) as Braun's cynical opportunist brother-in-law Hermann Fegelein, Ulrich Matthes as Goebbels, Corinna Harfouch who is beyond wonderful in the comparatively small but pivotal role of his wife Magda, Christian Berkel as Ernst-Günther Schenck, André Hennicke as General Mohnke, Michael Mendl - one of the few people in the film who was actually alive in 1945 - as General Weidling, Birgit Minichmayr as Gerda Christian and Gerald Alexander Held as Walther Hewel. The Hitler Youth member Peter Kranz is the only notable fictional character. As regards the historical characters, the film's epilogue gives the fate of all those who did not die in the film. The exact fate of Hitler's cook Constanze Manziarly is unknown as she disappeared without a trace after leaving the bunker but she is last seen holding a capsule of poison, a perfectly reasonable speculation on the part of the filmmakers.Overall, this is a powerful and thoughtful treatment of the material. My only criticism is that ten or so minutes could have been trimmed after Hitler committed suicide as the last half an hour occasionally lags. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar but I think that it deserved a Best Picture nomination. I also think that Bruno Ganz should have been nominated for Best Actor but perhaps a performance which depicts Hitler as a real person was not to Hollywood's taste.",Null,0,1,6 September 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," An excellent conclusion to the Middle-earth saga
","Considering how disappointed that I was with 'The Desolation of Smaug', I was more than a little apprehensive about watching this film. I needn't have worried as it was a hugely engrossing, excellent film, the best of the trilogy which ends the Middle-earth saga on a high. While it's certainly not on the same level as any of the films in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, that's true of 99% of the films that I've seen. My only real problem with the film was that Kíli and Tauriel were built up as being star crossed lovers for the ages when they spent about five minutes in each other's company over the course of two films. It seemed more like they fancied each other as opposed to being truly, madly, deeply in love, to be honest. That said, their scenes are lovely and Evangeline Lilly - who was far less annoying than she was in the few 'Lost' episodes that I've seen - and Aidan Turner have great chemistry.The action scenes look wonderful and the acting was generally of a very high standard. Aside from the film series' veterans such as Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Cate Blanchett (the only actor other than McKellen to appear in all six films), I was particularly impressed by Ryan Gage as Alfrid, Luke Evans as Bard and Aidan Turner as Kíli. I loved the cameos from Christopher Lee and Hugo Weaving, both of whom were absent from the previous film after appearing in all of the first four (or at least the extended versions thereof), as well as Stephen Fry and Billy Connolly. I was also far more impressed with Smaug in this film since he actually spent more time doing what dragons do and spent less time yakking. A major part of the reason that Smaug worked better in this film was that he had less screen time. Less is more as far as dragons are concerned.",Null,5,10,19 January 2015
X-Men: First Class," The perfect prequel
","After the lacklustre 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and the very poor 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', this is a magnificent return to form for the franchise. It's an absolutely brilliant film.James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender make for extremely engaging leading men, wisely choosing to put their own stamps on the younger Professor Xavier and Magneto rather than merely emulating Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen's performances. Their relationship is fascinating and wonderfully acted by both men. It also highlights just how badly Wolverine and Sabretooth's potentially fascinating relationship was handled in the previous film. The film has a stellar cast overall. Kevin Bacon is suitably creepy and contemptible as Sebastian Shaw. Of the rest of the cast, the strongest performers were Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy. I adored Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn's cameos and it was nice to see Michael Ironside, Ray Wise and Rade erbedija pop up in small roles.It makes for the perfect prequel, very effectively illustrating the characters' early years and influences and how the events of this film impacted on their lives, making them the characters to whom we were introduced (on film, anyway) in 'X-Men'. This was done best in Magneto's case, followed by Mystique and Professor Xavier. It's certainly the best prequel that I've ever seen.",Null,0,3,28 September 2014
The Wolverine," A decent but unexceptional film
","Hugh Jackman is once again excellent and it's certainly much better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', the previous Wolverine solo film, but it's still not really anything to get excited about. The storyline is quite good but not terribly exciting. None of the other characters really came alive. I really didn't like the giant adamantium samurai suit in the final act. It was a bit too silly for me.However, I did really like the fact that it was more about Wolverine the character as opposed to Wolverine the plot device, as was the case in the aforementioned film. Jean Grey's periodic appearances in Wolverine's mind were definitely the best part of the film and I loved Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen's cameos, foreshadowing 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'.",Null,0,2,30 October 2014
Iron Man," A very fun and exciting superhero film
","The first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this is a very fun and exciting superhero film which served as a great introduction to the title character. Although there are some pacing problems, the script is generally strong and it is well directed by Jon Favreau. I have been planning to watch the MCU films and TV series in full from the beginning for the ages and I finally took the plunge today. The only entry in the franchise that I have previously seen is 'Captain America: The First Avenger' when it was first released in 2011. First of all, I should say that I have never really been terribly interested in Marvel and my knowledge of its characters comes almost exclusively through adaptations and by osmosis. I say 'almost' since I think that I have read three Marvel comics in my life. As an indication of my Marvel ignorance, I had never even heard of their version of Thor or the Guardians of the Galaxy before their films were released. As such, I will be reviewing these films on their own merits since that it is all I can do, really.Robert Downey, Jr. gives a wonderful performance as Tony Stark, a playboy genius industrialist whose hugely successful company has made weapons for the US government for decades. He is dismissive of any suggestion that his work is in any way immoral. However, after being severely wounded by one of his own weapons and escaping from the clutches of an Afghani terrorist group called the Ten Rings, he sees things from a different perspective and announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons. Over the course of the film, Tony goes from being a self-obsessed businessman primarily concerned with drinking and gambling to a true hero of the old mould. However, the characterisation is so good that this transition seems entirely realistic, even with all the sci-fi trappings. I think that Tony was always a very good man. He just needed his eyes to be opened to the problems of the world around him and what he could do to fix them. He finally realised that creating weapons of mass destruction was not the way to solve said problems. Downey is never less than entirely convincing as Tony, who manages to keep his composure when others would be in a state of panic and has a sardonic remark for most situations. I love quirky, self-deprecating, conflicted characters and he is a great example of that.Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress but she has certainly been better in other films where she had more interesting characters. Pepper Potts is in the film to be Stark's love interest and that's about it. She doesn't have many characteristics beyond the fact that she loves him and her major contribution to the plot is the requisite, though very entertaining, damsel in distress scenes. She is not a very strong character, I'm afraid, which is a shame as she is the only female character who appears in more than a few scenes. Theirs is also a pretty tepid romance. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Obadiah Stane, bringing his great talent to bear as the Stark Industries manager. While much of Stane's storyline was admittedly predictable, it was handled extremely well and there is a terrific sense of tension between Downey and Bridges for most of the film. Terrence Howard is great as Tony's best friend and military liaison Colonel James Rhodes and it is a shame that he did not return for any of the sequels. Shaun Toub gives one of the best performances in the film as Stark's fellow captive Yinsen - I thought that the character would be a villain when he was introduced but he turns out to be one of the most honest, decent characters in the film - while Farah Tahir is suitably creepy as the Ten Rings' leader Raza. As the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Paul Bettany has some great lines and his wry wit is a nice complement to Stark's. I loved the Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson cameos. Lee is such a legend that I have great affection for him even though I don't read Marvel Comics! The strongest scenes in the film are the ones in which Tony is held captive by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan and creates a rudimentary Iron Man suit out of scrap. I loved these scenes both because they were the perfect illustration of Tony's intelligence and resourcefulness and because Tony and Yinsen worked so well together. Speaking of Afghanistan, I really liked the manner in which the film handled the War on Terror. Its exploration of the morality of Tony's weapon systems was also very good. On the negative side, the film has some pretty serious pacing issues which last from Tony's rescue until his return to Afghanistan as Iron Man, which is about half an hour. Admittedly, these scenes were necessary for later on in the film but they were not terribly good or interesting. I often found myself bored during them, if I'm honest. However, the film rollicks along at a great pace from then until the end of the film. The battle scenes are hugely impressive, 'edge of your seat' stuff, which is exactly what I want from a superhero film.Overall, this is an extremely good film which could have been an excellent one if it had not been for the aforementioned problems. I look forward to watching the rest of the films in the series.",Null,2,3,15 September 2015
Casino Royale," An extremely impressive debut for Daniel Craig
","The only Bond film that I saw in the cinema when it was first released, this is a magnificent return to form after 'Die Another Day'. While that film was, for all intents and purposes, a sci-fi film and an utterly dreadful one at that, this brings the series back down to Earth in much the same was as 'For Your Eyes Only' did after 'Moonraker'. Daniel Craig makes an extremely impressive debut as the sixth James Bond. His newly promoted, inexperienced 007 is a cold, deeply flawed, troubled and, in some ways, quite vulnerable character. In that sense, he reminded me of Timothy Dalton's Bond, particularly in 'The Living Daylights'. While his Bond is harder than many of them, Craig is still every bit as charming and suave as his predecessors when the script demands it. He very effectively silenced the critics and fans who balked at his casting and labelled him 'Bland, James Bland' before he had even filmed a scene.The strongest main villain in many years, Mads Mikkelsen is excellent as LeChiffre, managing to be both menacing and charismatic in equal measure. Ruthless, arrogant and highly intelligent, he is a wonderful character and the Mikkelsen's performance conveys all of his rather unpleasant characteristics with a level of skill that makes it all seem effortless. He's the most believable main villain since Franz Sanchez in 'Licence to Kill' and I loved the fact that, unlike most of his predecessors, he has to answer to someone and his life is put in serious danger by someone other than Bond. Eva Green is absolutely mesmering as Vesper Lynd and I think that you'd have to go back to Pussy Galore or Tracy di Vicenzo to find a better Bond girl. Her chemistry with Craig is electric and, while it was very good before that, the film truly takes off once she makes her first appearance on the Montenegro train and cuts Bond down to size. She is concerned about Bond's ego, with some justification, and refuses to become another notch on his bedpost, making both of these things clear to him in no uncertain terms. She is the strongest modern Bond girl and is in every sense Bond's equal but she seems like a real person. Retreating to the shower to metaphorically wash off the blood after the deaths of Steven Obanno and his accomplice is the most realistic reaction to death that I've ever seen in a thriller, not just a Bond film. As regards whether she genuinely loved Bond, I think that she did as she stopped wearing the necklace that her boyfriend gave her towards the end of the film. Saving Bond's life after he went into cardiac arrest, living her phone behind and ultimately sacrificing herself said a great deal about her character than betraying him. The scenes towards the end of the film which depict Bond and Vesper spending them together are the sweetest and most romantic sequences since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. If circumstances had been different, I think that they would have been very happy together. As Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor reprise his role from a previous film in 'GoldenEye', the same is true of Judi Dench as M in this film. While she always had very good chemistry with Pierce Brosnan, her chemistry with Craig is on another level. Most of her interactions with Bond are extremely tense and serve as one of the highlights of the film. However, I felt that her phone conversation with Bond towards the end indicated that she does have a certain fondness for him in spite of everything and her interaction with him in that scene had certain maternal undertones. Of the rest of the supporting cast, Giancarlo Giannini is the true standout. He is simply wonderful as René Mathis, playing with role with such style, charisma, intelligence and wit. I can't praise him enough. Jesper Christensen is extremely good as Mr White and, while I have liked if he had more screen time, it is fitting that he did not as it makes both him and his organisation appear more shadowy. Jeffrey Wright is very good as Felix Leiter, making his first appearance since 'Licence to Kill', but likewise has too little screen time. Caterina Murino is suitably enchanting as the film's sacrificial lamb Solange Dimetrios while Simon Abkarian is suitably vile as her husband Alex Dimetrios. It was also nice to see Tom Chadbon, Malcolm Sinclair, Christina Cole and Crispin Bonham-Carter pop up in small roles.The opening sequence is one of the most low-key but also one of the most effective and I loved its quasi-film noir vibe. Eschewing the heavy use of CGI seen in 'Die Another Day', the action scenes are done the old fashioned way and the film is all the better for it. I thought that all of them were brilliantly done, particularly the crane sequence in Madagascar and the chase at Miami Airport. However, some of them could have been trimmed slightly as many of them go on for a tad too long. In spite of how important they are to the plot, I had similar concerns about the poker scenes. If you have never played poker and your limited understanding of it comes from watching 'Star Trek: The Next Generation', this scenes can get a tad boring at times. I think that they could have cut a good 10 minutes from the film without it affecting the plot, if I'm honest.In spite of those minor criticisms, I'm giving it a perfect score as this is an absolutely brilliant film which successfully updates Bond for the 21st Century while remaining true to the franchise's roots.",Null,2,6,20 July 2014
Before Sunrise," One of the most beautiful films ever made
","Absolutely sublime. All I could think while watching the film was, 'This is wonderful.' I had extremely high expectations for the film. It not only met them but it far surpassed them at every turn. The writing is beautiful. The dialogue is so natural and realistic that it seems like we are following a day in the lives of two real people. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are fantastic as Jesse and Céline. Their performances and their phenomenal chemistry are both note perfect. I have always been a big fan of Hawke and I think that he is one of the most underrated actors of his generation but I had never seen Delpy in a film and, like everything else in the film, she blew me away.At several points during the film, Jesse and Céline discuss the fact that they are in their own world and it is as if time has stopped while they are ambling through Vienna. This is emphasised by the fact that none of the other characters in the film receive names and none of them appear for more than two or three minutes. It is as if they are shadows. Interestingly, neither Jesse nor Céline receive surnames. I adored the fact that they left it ambiguous as to whether they had sex.The film was largely based on the director and co-writer Richard Linklater's similar experience with a woman named Amy Lehrhaupt in Philadelphia in 1989. He never saw her again and only found out in 2010 that she had been killed in a motorbike accident in 1994. It also draws inspiration from 'Ulysses' (most notably the fact that the film involves travelling through a city on 16 June), 'My Dinner with Andre' and perhaps from the 1945 film 'The Clock' starring Judy Garland and Robert Walker. I saw this film for the first time yesterday but it has already become my eleventh favourite film of all time. Just fabulous.",Null,2,2,16 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An absolutely marvelous, thrilling film
","Perhaps the most anticipated film of the decade, this is an absolutely marvelous, thrilling film. While I do like the prequels, this film does a considerably better job of recapturing the tone and atmosphere of the original trilogy. It has a great spirit of adventure, a compelling emotional core and it does a very good job of further fleshing out the 'Star Wars' universe. The characters, both old and new, are very well treated. The film has a very strong script by J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt and Abram's direction was excellent. He is certainly much more suited to 'Star Wars' than 'Star Trek'. It hits all of the right notes. It is my third favourite film in the franchise, after 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'A New Hope'.Approximately 30 years after the events of 'Return of the Jedi', a new Republic exists in the galaxy but things are far from peaceful as the First Order has arisen to fill the power vacuum left by the defeat of the Empire. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and their compatriots in the Rebellion have achieved a mythic status comparable to King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This is rather appropriate since Obi-Wan Kenobi was essentially Merlin in the original trilogy. Some people even doubt that they ever existed. However, those in the upper echelons of the First Order are not among them as they are on the hunt for Luke, who went into self-imposed exile years earlier and has not been seen since. In any event, Kylo Ren knows from personal experience that Luke and Han are very real.Of the returning actors, Harrison Ford has the most substantial screen time and he fits right back into the role of Han. In some respects, he has changed very little as he is still the same wisecracking, scruffy looking, nerf-herder that he was three decades later. In others, however, he has changed a great deal as he is suffering a great deal of pain emotionally speaking due to his less than stellar relationship with his son. He becomes a father figure to Rey and perhaps he even starts to think of her as a surrogate daughter. Carrie Fisher does not have a great deal to do as General Organa, the erstwhile Princess Leia, but her first scene with Ford is her best. It is implied that they have not seen each other in years but there is still the old chemistry between them. They may not have lived happily ever like many fans had hoped but they still love each deeply in spite of everything and that says a lot. Mark Hamill's appearance is kept until the end of the film. This was a very intelligent move as it built the anticipation very effectively, not only during this film but for Episode VIII.Of the new characters, my favourite was definitely Rey, played wonderfully by Daisy Ridley who has a very bright future ahead of her. As is demonstrated throughout the film, the Force is strong in Rey and she is able to take care of herself. She is fiercely intelligent, loyal, kind and principled. She is very adaptable and takes everything in her stride but she is vulnerable in one sense as she was abandoned on Jakku many years earlier. The fact that she can kick ass is very cool but I would not have loved Rey nearly as much as I did if she was not such a strong character in terms of her personality. Adam Driver is excellent as Kylo Ren, who is more trained in the ways of the Force than Rey but less adept. He is very quick to anger and throws several tantrums throughout the film. He idolises Darth Vader and longs to be as strong as him. He is a deeply conflicted character, which makes him very compelling. John Boyega is great as Finn, the former stormtrooper with a conscience. At first, Rey does not think much of him in spite of his claims to be with the Resistance but she gradually becomes extremely fond of him. They have a nice, sweet relationship. Not only that but Finn has some of the funniest moments in the film, particularly when it comes to his interaction with Han. The film also features nice appearances from Anthony Daniel as C-3PO, Kenny Baker as R2-D2, Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron and the great Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka.The special effects are unsurprisingly excellent from the fantastic opening shot onwards but I liked the fact that it made use of practical effects in some cases as opposed to the wall to wall CGI of the prequels. Maz Kanata was the best of the CGI characters though. The film had a great undercurrent of humour, much of which was provided by Artoo's heir apparent, the adorable BB-8. The extensive use of the Millennium Falcon was my favourite of the many callbacks to the original trilogy.Overall, this is a brilliant film which was everything that I ever wanted from a 'Star Wars' film and more. It has given the franchise a new hope, to coin a phrase.",Null,56,130,21 December 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Hugely enjoyable and imaginative
","A hugely enjoyable, clever and imaginative slasher film which very effectively explores the nature of reality and imagination. Robert Englund is excellent as Freddy Krueger, who works brilliantly in no small part because his screen time is so limited. However, the entire cast is very good, particularly Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp (whatever happened to him?), John Saxon and Ronee Blakley. The film is often extremely frightening, never more so than Tina's death scene, and Freddy Krueger makes for a terrifying and highly memorable villain, not least because big knives scare the bejesus out of me!One that I particularly loved about the film is that Nancy is such a strong, intelligent and resourceful character and a fighter. Rather than accepting her fate, she tackles the situation head-on and develops a plan to trap and defeat Freddy. Speaking of the dead child murderer, I have an adorable one-year-old Golden Cocker Spaniel named Freddie. I naturally knew who Freddy Krueger was but, had I seen the film prior to a year and a half ago, I would have given my dog a different name!On the negative side, the film's music is occasionally rather irritating. It also loses some of its momentum in its last half an hour and it doesn't seem to have same level of imagination as the rest of the film, though the ambiguous ending is excellent. On the strength of its first hour, I'd have given it full marks.",Null,0,0,20 February 2015
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," A most triumphant sci-fi comedy
","While not the first work of fiction to feature a time travelling phone box, this is a most triumphant sci-fi comedy. The film has a very strong script by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon. Like the two central characters, the jokes may not be the cleverest but they're extremely funny. The cleverest moment in the film is the inspired use of time travel to rescue the personages of historical significance. Stephen Herek does a very good job at directing the film, bringing a huge amount of flair and energy to the proceedings. At only 86 minutes, excluding the credits, it rollicks along at a great pace and manages to fit quite a bit into its short running time.The film stars Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves as the Two Great Ones Bill S. Preston, Esq. and Ted 'Theodore' Logan, a pair of well meaning, gormless high school age slackers living in San Dimas, California in 1988. Although they don't even know how to play their instruments yet, the music of their garage band Wyld Stallyns - which, as they say at every opportunity, rule - will eventually form the basis for all human society. Sure, why not? Humanity could do an awful lot worse than to live by Bill and Ted's maxim of 'Be excellent to each other and party on, dudes!' However, all is not well. In order to ensure that this utopia comes about, Rufus is sent from the year 2688 to help the boys pass their history class and prevent Ted from being sent to an Alaskan military school. Much of the credit for the film's success has to go to Winter and Reeves, who have a very likable screen presence, great comic timing and terrific chemistry. It is very easy to accept them as best friends from the moment that they are introduced. Although Reeves has had the more successful career, to put it mildly, I think that Winter is the more talented of the two. Actually, the only Keanu Reeves performances that I have ever actually liked are contained in this film and 'Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey'. He does vacant very well, in fairness to him. George Carlin's appearances as the time travelling benefactor Rufus are little more than an extended cameo but he certainly makes a big impression. In a temporal paradox that was probably unintentional, Rufus never actually introduces himself to Bill and Ted. They learn his name from their future selves. On their trip through time, Bill and Ted pick up a variety of famous historical figures. Terry Camilleri does not have as much screen time as most of the others but he is a laugh riot as the 'short dead dude' Napoleon, who develops an affinity for San Dimas in the late 20th Century particularly the water park Waterloo. I hope that he remembers that name as it may come back to haunt him. Unlike most other time travel films, this one actually addresses the language issue as the only historical figure from a non-English speaking country who can speak English is the polyglot Sigmund Freud. I think that the only English word that Socrates speaks is 'geek,' which he learns at the mall in 1988. Nevertheless, Tony Steedman is likewise hilarious as the ancient philosopher, who takes everything in his stride. He and the underrated Dan Shor, who plays Billy the Kid, are a great double act. I have to admit that I first heard of Socrates from this film when I was a child and, as such, 'So Crates!' pops into my head every time that I hear his name to this day. My knowledge of him and his many accomplishments has increased in the meantime, I hasten to add. Rod Loomis is great as Freud and Robert V. Barron is perfectly cast as Abraham Lincoln. I loved the fact that all of the historical figures were ready, willing and able to go along with Bill and Ted's plan to show them off at their final history report, though it was hinted that Genghis Khan and Joan of Arc (who was not Noah's wife, by the way) only had the vaguest idea of what was going on. Oddly enough, this is one of three films or TV shows that I am aware of in which Lincoln and Genghis Khan have run into each other, the others being the 'Star Trek' episode 'The Savage Curtain' and 'Clone High'. They're not exactly the most obvious historical duo! I also loved the little moments such as Billy the Kid and Socrates playing with a ball, Billy the Kid clearly being smitten with Joan of Arc - played by Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go's, which is suitably random - and Napoleon attempting to make his moves on Missy, Bill's very young stepmother to whom both he and Ted are attracted. Hal Landon, Jr. and Bernie Casey are great straight men as Ted's hardass father Captain John Logan and the firm but fair history teacher Mr. Ryan, who are probably the two most believable characters in the film.Overall, this is a bodacious time travel film. When I wasn't laughing, I was grinning from ear to ear.",Null,0,0,24 April 2016
The Great Escape," The best war film ever made
","My fifth favourite film of all time, it gets my vote as the best war film ever made. I love that its focus on is not a great battle but the ingenuity and bravery of ordinary men in an extraordinary situation. The film is a thrilling, rollicking adventure with moments of great escapism but at the same time it is often moving and it's extremely well characterised. The film is incredibly well structured. It may be 2 hours and 43 minutes long yet it drags for less than two minutes of that time.As it says at the beginning of the film, the characters are fictionalised composites of the Stalag Luft III inmates but it hues closely to the events surrounding the actual Great Escape. It's a film that respects the audience's intelligence. There is no happy ending. In the film, as in real life, only 3 of the 76 escapees managed to evade capture and 50 of those who were recaptured were murdered. The film is dedicated to their memory.It has one of the best casts of any film that I've ever seen and John Sturges' direction is fantastic. I don't think that there's anyone who gives a bad performance. Sturges also directed my fourth favourite film, 'The Magnificent Seven', in which Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Charles Bronson also starred. Both films certainly benefit from excellent scores by Elmer Bernstein.I liked the fact that not all of the Nazis are treated as being completely evil. Werner, who disappears after the first half sadly, doesn't seem too different from the kind of soldier that you'd find in any army and even the camp commandment Colonel von Luger shows a glimmer of conscience when he tells Ramsey that 50 of the escapees have been shot.They don't make them like this anymore. I'm glad that the film was made in 1963 because I doubt that it would be made with the same subtlety, intelligence or attention to detail now. They would probably give it a Hollywood style ending.",Null,2,4,13 March 2015
Macbeth," Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing
","The most recent of the many screen versions of the Scottish Play, this is a truly abysmal adaptation of one of Shakespeare's finest works. Justin Kurzel's direction is appalling. He seems to be more interested in artistic gimmicks such as the pointless and distracting slow motion in the first battle scene and in showing blood and guts than in the raw emotion and psychology of the play. It is an exercise in flash over substance, which comes across as pretentious. It is as if he is trying to convince us that he is a great filmmaker. Well, he succeeded in convincing me of quite the opposite, I'm afraid. Not only that but the film looks cheap. At one point, I was worried that there was something wrong with the DVD as the camera work was so shoddy. Sadly, there wasn't. I could not help comparing the would-be affecting battle scenes to the powerful and gritty ones seen in Kenneth Branagh's version of 'Henry V' and I could also not help finding them wanting. All I kept thinking was that it would have been considerably better if Branagh, my favourite living director, had been given the job. Rumour has it that he is considering his own version and I really hope that that's true.The shots of Scottish scenery are nice but so what? I could easily just go back to Scotland (where I lived for a year) and see them in person without suffering through this. Kurzel's direction is utterly lacking in energy, style or flair and, if he understands the play, there's not much indication of it on screen. Although if you like fog, you're in luck. Presumably this was intended to make the film moody and atmospheric but it is merely another entry in its litany of failures. This is the 24th Shakespearean adaptation that I have watched since January 2015 so I am a bit of an aficionado of the Bard's work. I am afraid that this is the worst Shakespearean adaptation that I have ever seen. I was not enamoured of either Orson Welles' lacklustre 1948 version or Roman Polanski's creepy and off-putting 1971 version but I preferred both of them to this. 'Macbeth' is one of my favourite Shakespearean plays but I have yet to see a screen version that does it justice. I'd sell my soul to be able to see Laurence Olivier's unmade 1950s version which would have starred himself and his then wife Vivien Leigh. Richard Burton and Sean Connery's unmade versions would have probably been worthwhile as well. This version, however, is a masterclass in how not to make Shakespeare for the screen. I can't remember the last time that I was so utterly and bitterly disappointed by a film.Shakespearean adaptations live or die on the strength of their cast and this one suffers from poor performances from otherwise good actors. The film stars Michael Fassbender in an atypically bad performance as the Thane of Glamis and later of Cawdor whose vaulting ambition propels him onto the throne of Scotland. Fassbender makes for an extremely uninvolving Macbeth and he often seems more bored than anything. He is completely unable to convey the character's inner conflict, self- doubt or lack of strength and is particularly weak during the crucial 'Dagger of the mind' and 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow' soliloquies. I would have much preferred to see his 'X-Men' co-star James McAvoy in the role and not just because he is actually Scottish. Marion Cotillard is better but only marginally so since Lady Macbeth is nowhere near as compelling or even interesting a character in the film as she is in the play. The supporting cast includes Paddy Considine, David Hayman, David Thewlis, Sean Harris, Maurice Roëves and Jack Reynor but only Hayman and Harris are particularly impressive or even memorable and then only in small doses. Seylan Baxter, Lynn Kennedy, Kayla Fallon and Amber Rissmann play the Witches but you would not know that there was anything the least bit supernatural about them in spite of the fact that was rather what Shakespeare was going for. Presumably at the (poor) direction of Kurzel, most of the actors mumble their lines rather than enunciate clearly. Another bad idea poorly executed. I will say this about Kurzel though: at least he's consistent.Overall, this is a simply deplorable version of a fantastic play. If I were Shakespeare, I would want my name taken off it. After Duncan's murder, Lady Macbeth says what's done cannot be undone. Well, I wish that I could find a way to undo watching this travesty. There's an old saying in Hollywood: 'You can make a bad film out of a good script but you can't make a good film out of a bad script.' This may not be a Hollywood film but it is a textbook example of the first part of that aphorism. This will undoubtedly be one of my Bottom Five of 2016. At the moment, it is No. 2 after the Chinese film 'Pingguo', which was unleashed on the unsuspecting English speaking world as 'Lost in Beijing'. Hopefully, unlike Duncan and later the title character himself, the film 'Macbeth' will not be usurped.",Null,19,28,7 May 2016
Valkyrie," A gripping thriller which maintains a high level of tension and foreboding throughout
","A largely historically accurate account of the failed 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, this is a very effective thriller which maintains a high level of tension and foreboding throughout. The very good script by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander has a nice eye for historical detail and respects the audience's intelligence while Bryan Singer directs the film with his usual flair. At 1 hour and 50 minutes, the film is not especially long and it rollicks along at a very brisk pace.Tom Cruise is a modern day John Wayne in that he is a great film star as opposed to a great actor but he is perfectly fine as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a man of great courage, honour and resourcefulness who is recruited into the German Resistance in 1943 and becomes one of the leading figures in the plot to save Germany from Nazism. Even before the war, von Stauffenberg was dubious of the Nazis and these feelings became more pronounced as he learned of their atrocities. He is able to cut through the constant arguments that are besetting his co-conspirators and convinces them of the necessity of cutting off the snake's head rather than attacking its tail. He has a clarity of vision which makes him the perfect person to lead the operation. His assumption that Hitler has been killed in the explosion at the Wolf's Lair is based not on wishful thinking but on a reasoned and perfectly logical conclusion based on the evidence that he could not have survived, though one which unfortunately turned out to be incorrect.Although he is credited second, Kenneth Branagh has little more than a glorified cameo as General Henning von Tresckow but he is extremely good in the role. Bill Nighy gives the best performance in the film as General Friedrich Olbricht, whose neurotic behaviour and indecision causes many problems for the Resistance. In spite of this, he is depicted as a good man but one who would probably not have been allowed to play such a significant role in the plot due to his unsuitable personal traits if the Resistance had had more options at their disposal. Tom Wilkinson is excellent as the 'careerist pig' Friedrich Fromm who becomes involved in the plot out of love for himself rather than out of hatred for the Nazis. Kevin McNally is suitably unctuous as Carl Goerdeler, a more antagonistic figure in the film than in reality who would have become Chancellor of Germany had the plot succeeded. Terence Stamp brings a great deal of quiet dignity to the role of the would-be President Ludwig Beck, who displays great wisdom and integrity in all of his scenes.Out of the supporting cast, I was very impressed by David Bamber as Hitler (who, wisely, is kept off-screen for the most of the film, making only brief appearances), Jamie Parker as Lt. von Haeften, Carice von Houten as von Stauffenberg's wife Nina (who died only two and a half years before the film was released), Thomas Kretschmann as Otto Remer (an infamous postwar Holocaust denier), Christian Berkel as Colonel von Quirnheim, Kenneth Cranham as Field Marshal Keitel and Tom Hollander as Colonel Brandt, a major thorn in the conspirators' side for most of the film who unwittingly saved Hitler's life at the cost of his own when he moved the briefcase containing the bomb. It also features nice small appearances by Bernard Hill, Danny Webb, Chris Larkin, David Schofield and Ian McNeice. However, I thought that Eddie Izzard was a very odd choice for Fellgiebel, though he does try his best.The aborted 15 July attempt on Hitler's life is not depicted in an entirely accurate fashion but, had it been carried out then, it may have had a better chance of success. I can't help but wonder how the Allies would have reacted if the plot had been successful in assassinating Hitler. I'd be interested in reading an alternate history novel on the subject. The use of Operation Valkyrie to seize control of the government was a brilliant idea which could very well have worked if Hitler had been killed. I thought that the film did a very good job of portraying the confusion that plagued both sides in the hours after the bomb was detonated, particularly as regards whether Hitler was alive or dead. He was basically Schrödinger's Führer! Overall, this is a gripping thriller which depicted the events surrounding the 20 July plot and the individuals who laid down their lives to enact it with a great deal of admiration and respect.",Null,1,1,4 October 2015
All the President's Men," An absolutely brilliant political thriller
","Based on the 1974 book of the same name by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, this is an absolutely brilliant political thriller. I think that the film is a largely historically accurate depiction of the two 'Washington Post' journalists' investigation into the Watergate scandal and the surrounding conspiracy. The film has a wonderful script by William Goldman, whose name is synonymous with quality in my book. It throws a great deal of information our way but it is such a taut, well-paced, well-thought-out script that it never runs the risk of overwhelming the audience with exposition. I also have to praise the sterling direction of Alan J. Pakula, who is able to maintain a high level of tension and suspense throughout the film. It is never less than gripping from beginning to end. I liked the fact that music is used sparingly as it added to the sheer sense of realism on display. The film was nominated for Best Picture but it lost to 'Rocky'. No comment.The film stars Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in a pair of fantastic performances as Woodward and Bernstein respectively. Hoffman is marginally better than Redford but both men deserved Oscar nominations for Best Actor and it is a shame that the Academy was not forthcoming in either case. I wish that they made other films together as they have such great chemistry. Following the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972, Woodward, a rookie reporter who has only been with 'The Washington Post' for nine months, is assigned to cover the matter as it is not considered to be worth the attention of anyone higher up in the paper. He soon discovers that the five burglars have all had prior involvement with the CIA and is able to establish a link between them and former CIA agent E. Howard Hunt and Nixon's Special Counsel Charles Colson. The more experienced Bernstein, who has a tendency to ruffle people's feathers, inveigles himself into the investigation and the two reporters are assigned to together on the story together. Neither of them are particularly thrilled about it but they develop a strong, if occasionally a little combative, working relationship. They're not exactly best friends but they spark off each other and give each other ideas. Bernstein is depicted as being a little obnoxious and he has a 'bull in a china shop' mentality when it comes to asking questions of reluctant interviewees, which is almost all of them. It serves as a very effective contrast to the more amiable Woodward's 'softly, softly' approach. Bernstein tends to go with gut feelings far more than Woodward. However, they are able to procure many results working together than they may not have been able to get alone.Much of the investigation concerns the illegal and unconstitutional activities of the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP. If this film were pure fiction, I would mock the use of an organisation with the acronym 'CREEP' as laughable since no one in their right mind would pick a name like that. It just goes to show that sometimes fact is stranger than fiction! While some of them are heard over the phone, none of the senior members of the conspiracy such as G. Gordon Liddy, the former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, the White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman (regularly referred to as being 'the second most powerful man in the country') and Jeb Stuart Magruder are seen on screen. This was a brilliant move on Goldman's part as it served the emphasise the existence of a shadowy conspiracy which involved 'the entire US intelligence community.' Nixon himself is only seen in archive footage. One of the best illustrations of this is his renomination at the 1972 Republican Convention, which was announced by his eventual successor Gerald Ford. The events surrounding Ford's elevation to the presidency just shy of two years later could not have been predicted at the time so it was merely a stroke of good fortune for the filmmakers that it was Ford who chaired the Convention. Another very effective use of archive footage is the depiction of Nixon being sworn in for his second term in the final scene on January 20, 1973, in which he swears, as part of the oath of office, to 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.'Jason Robards won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar but I don't think that his performance as the newspaper's executive editor Ben Bradlee was worthy of it. He was never a great actor and, in this film, he delivered most of his lines in a monotone and shouted the rest. More deserving of the award or at least a nomination were Jack Warden as the local editor Harry M. Rosenfeld, Martin Balsam as the managing editor Howard Simons or the suitably enigmatic Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat, who was revealed to be former FBI Associate Director W. Mark Felt in 2005. Conversely, Jane Alexander is excellent in the small role of the bookkeeper Judy Hoback Miller, who was vital in unravelling the conspiracy, and her Best Supporting Actress nomination was well deserved. She is really the closest thing that the film has a female lead. The film also feature nice small appearances from Ned Beatty, F. Murray Abraham, Lindsay Crouse and Meredith Baxter. In a great moment of art imitating life, Frank Wills, the security guard who secured a place in history for himself when he told the police about the break-in, plays himself at the beginning of the film.Overall, this is a superb film which serves as a powerful reminder of the vital role that the Fourth Estate plays in society and as a damning indictment of the worst excesses of political corruption in a democratic state.",Null,3,3,14 March 2016
The Godfather," An absolute masterpiece from beginning to end
","Today, I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps in my film knowledge by watching one of the most popularly and critically acclaimed films of all time. I had picked up some of it by osmosis through references and parodies in other works but most of it was completely new to me, I'm glad to say. The acting, writing and direction are all of an extraordinarily high standard. It is a wonderfully told epic tale of family, betrayal, vengeance and a twisted sense of honour. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don.In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don's youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see 'The Bells of St. Mary's' – in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while 'The Godfather Part II' was the second – in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael's first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael's leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father's death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando.James Caan is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don's unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family's consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall: John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her. The film's cinematography is beautiful. I particularly loved the frequent use of shadow and darkness. The long takes, one of my favourite film techniques, are not of the same duration as in the films of Orson Welles or Kenneth Branagh but they are used very effectively. My absolute favourite scene in the film is the baptism of Connie's son Michael which is interspersed with a series of brutal murders. Not only is it shot in a fantastic way but it provides another great contrast as well as illustrating Michael's descent.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which lives up to the hype.",Null,6,9,23 May 2015
