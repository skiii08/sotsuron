Your Name.," Beautiful and surprising
",I'm not a writer or film reviewer by any stretch of the imagination so consider yourself fore warned.This movie caught my eye on netflix months ago and I always passed it by because honestly it looked like a romantic drama and I wasn't really interested. Eventually I kind of ran out of things to watch and though I'd give it a go.Instantly the premise was interesting if a little 'done' but the characters were likable and the animation was beautiful so I kind of let it go.Where this film ultimately goes surprised the hell out of me when I watched it but now that I think about it there are several other films and shows that play with similar ideas. I suppose its the mixing of the two different ideas (body swap and time) that caught me off guard at the time.An amazing beautiful film that's recommendation is hampered only by its being anime. There are people I know that would love this film if it were live action and simply will not watch it because its anime.,9,0,0,30 August 2019
