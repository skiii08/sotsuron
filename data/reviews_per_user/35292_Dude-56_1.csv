","Should have been called:The Bland Witch ProductOveractive camera that was less 'amateur' than annoying.  Dippy dialog 'Dude, this isn't funny Dude!'.  Poor Suspense/Scare build - the clip used in the teasers 'I'm scared to close my eyes' was a throwaway in the film, rather than a real tense high point.  STUPID ending, I thought of 3 better ways to do that final scene on way back to the car.  My wife was nutty for this film, and I even prepared myself by reducing the Hype factor and walking into the theatre expecting a poor film (hoping to be surprised) but I sadly was not.Avoid the Hype, avoid the movie, see South Park again.",3,1,4,19 July 1999
