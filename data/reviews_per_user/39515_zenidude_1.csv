Blade Runner 2049," The Sequel we never knew we deserved.
","Before I begin my review I just wanted to say that I'm among the select few that didn't like the original Blade Runner. (Yeah, I know, come at me)One of the only redeemable factors of the original was that it was visually aesthetic. An amazing and avant-garde sci-fi world on par of what we have previously witnessed in Star Wars. The other factor being that it had a good concept. The whole human and replicant dynamic. Besides all that, sadly for me, the movie was overly long and very boring.However, this new and unexpected sequel had my attention. Mainly because Denis Villeneuve was the director. I've been watching his movies ever since Prisoners and boy, he didn't disappoint with this one.
Denis Villeneuve delivered what in our age is the rarest of jewels. A proper freaking sequel. He took everything from the original movie and expanded it beautifully in 2049. Not only 2049 is relatable to the original but more importantly, it stands as its own movie. In itself, it's quite the feat. Think Terminator 2:Judgement Day and more recently Mad Max: Fury Road.The story is great. The Cinematography Oscar-winning. The characters had depth and compelling arcs. Speaking of characters, the casting is brilliant. Ryan Gosling, The beautiful Ana de Armas, the underrated Sylvia Hoeks and Harrison Ford all brought their A-game.Talking of negatives this new one suffers from the same problems as of its predecessor. It's equally long and despite all the on-screen actions, a slow-burn movie.However, this movie is quite the experience and I left the theater smiling.",9,1,6,22 October 2019
