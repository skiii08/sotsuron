Blade Runner 2049," Failure as sequel, failure as stand-alone.
","** Warning! Here May Be Spoilers, for this movie and others. ** The original Blade Runner evoked a strong feeling: I might be manufactured by others, but it doesn't invalidate my identify. My experiences are singular and I feel them deeply. However I got here, I am real.Blade Runner 2049 starts with an alienated second-class citizen craving that validated authenticity. His story is derailed by side issues -- his owner/operator's problems, corporate drama, a sort of love interest, profit motive, the Resistance, (pseudo-)scientific posturing, and other irrelevancies. By the end, when the story has gone in a different direction entirely, our hero just lies down and gives up, and us with him.Specifics: Pacing / Story / Characters: BR2049 is too long and way too slow. There is no point or purpose, no golden narrative thread. Overall it watches like the boring parts of Matrix movies, eliminated from the supercut and reworked for a different color palette. Ryan Gosling is Neo, Jared Leto plays The Architect, Carla Juri is the Oracle, Edward James Olmos is The Keymaker...the parallels don't stop there. Yawn.Dialogue: the pretentious, vaguely ominous, Messianic BS that put you to sleep in the Matrix sequels has been refurbished for our sad, hunky Pinocchio in his futuristic pimp coat.Deckard: his part begins with a Disneyfied sequence a la 'Cowboys & Aliens' including cheesy wisecracks and a rough-and-tumble meet-cute, which ends unceremoniously with an 'I'm too old for this' surrender. The sequence takes place in a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas that has occasional funny parts (which I hope were unintentionally funny rather than failed attempts at comic relief for non-existent tension.) After investing so much time in Ryan Gosling and his story, the focus shifts to Deckard, who isn't himself away from LA, and whose tacked-on storyline hijacks the movie. (Regret: The lost years of Deckard and Rachael with the Replicant Resistance underground should have been a separate movie.) Here, Deckard starts as comic relief and ends as a plot device to move the story to some kind of conclusion. There is some emotional button-pushing for fans of the original (oh, Rachael!) and a tired attempt at emotional manipulation (getting to know the child we had no idea you'd ever wanted but for that one line a few minutes ago.)Costumes: there are no costumes, styles, or fashion. Only clothes.A/V: there are lovely, lingering shots of what appear to be abandoned Brutalist / Eastern Bloc / doomsday cult headquarters blanketed in untouched snow. There is gorgeous, impersonal CGI. There are building-high images of beautiful naked women, blandly presented and titillation-free. The music includes watery variations on the original score, interspersed with sinus-clearing brown noise.(I will probably buy this movie for those location shots, quiet stills, and long, honking chords. I even want the music. But it's sad that the kernel notes of Vangelis, so precise and delicate, shine out purely even as their impact is bled away by the insubstantial context of the movie and the score.) In contrast, I saw the sequel as a double feature with the remastered original, which took on new richness in the cinema setting. The original is a quick sit, modeled after rogue cop film noir: vibrant characters, clear narrative purpose, a stunning moll, gritty romance, and a getaway ending with a crystallized message. The sequel is pointless, diluted, internally inconsistent, and slow.In Blade Runner 2049, people cry All.The.Time. -- and now you know why.",3,74,158,7 October 2017
Black Swan," A single, overwhelming problem.
","CAVEAT: HERE THERE BE SPOILERS. Mild ones. The functional failure here was the pattern of giving facts and taking them away, then ending by giving us a fact that isn't taken away. As a device to show a character is losing her mind, this technique has one large pitfall: seeing the finale through her eyes rather than those of a trusted observer. We don't know if we can trust what we've seen. The movie creates a pattern of physical wounds, personality conflicts, violence and death occurring, then being nullified -- not being healed or overcome, but going away ab initio, every single time. When the last act ends with another death, who's to say the victim won't pop up and be fine? After all, that's what happened every other time during the movie. Why shouldn't this death be reversed as well?The actors did a great job, and the tech was excellent except for sound quality (but they may have had location problems; no big deal.) My complaint is strictly with the writer, or whoever owns that ending.",4,5,19,15 December 2010
Juno," You can tell it was written in a chainstore coffee shop.
","SPOILER ALERT! Caveat lector! For the benefit of anyone who has been living in a cave on Mars, and hasn't heard how this movie turns out, this is some rather spoilery stuff.Look: I don't care for dramas that tug on the heartstrings. I don't care for clever, coy, cutesy-poo teenagers -- particularly those who talk the way 30-year-olds imagine the young people are jiving these days. I don't like situations that are so far from reality that words and titles have lost all meaning. There is a lot for me not to like in this film.But PLEASE. A bold, intelligent, perfectly rational girl who is utterly devoid of embarrassment (she has loud conversations with the jerky store clerk about the pregnancy tests she is buying and peeing on right there in the store)...who planned for a year to have sex with her friend...did not, somehow, manage to consider birth control? REALLY? Not even the free condoms available at the women's clinic? The women's clinic, where she walked right up to the protester and had a casual conversation before heading inside and, for no reason, decided not to have an abortion when that had been her plan so far? So: a serious situation trivialized in a melodramatic and unfunny way, with a brainless character glorified for horrible, half-baked likes such as 'Honest to blog'? No love.Her working class parents have a 'Well, Shucks' reaction that makes one wonder if Xanax was involved. When Samuel L. Jackson mocks Geena Davis in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' by saying, 'Phooey, I burned the darned muffins,' he was emoting far beyond these mellow folks. Same with her school. Folks, don't mistake Minnesota Nice for Minnesota Non-judgmental. It doesn't exist.So basically, there is no pregnancy policy in her school, no social stigma, no complication to her health or pregnancy, no obstacle to treatment, no bills for medical services (tra-la!) -- and we are supposed to have anything invested in this charmless idiot? If you aren't going to give us a real girl, or a real situation, or even a real laugh, I'm not going to give a real damn. The only real character in the story is the honest swine who walks out on his marriage in order to be true to himself. Ugh.I could go on all day about the idiocy, but let me sum it up with the fact that the character's name is Juno, after the goddess of motherhood.She drives a Previa -- a real vehicle, but everyone should know 'placenta previa' is a dangerous complication of pregnancy.And her last name is MacGuff -- as in 'MacGuffin', the term for a plot device that leads everyone around without having any weight or value. Just like the pregnancy in this movie.I feel like the author was pretty openly stating that she doesn't care about the character, either. So why should we?",5,1,5,21 November 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Only mildly spoilery, but a major mess regardless.
","While I admit to preferring the book versions of most works, I am not a literalist. Movies such as L.A. Confidential used major surgery to transform brilliant but impossibly stream-of-consciousness writing into a singular, excellent, same-but-different movie. It's not impossible and it's not anathema to make major changes.The Hobbit makes a lot of changes from the text, but very few improvements. A scene is added at the beginning to show some history in an effective, concise way, and I understand the addition of major players at Rivendell to provide a little more exposition even if I found it boringly rendered. (If Galadriel spoke any more slowly, she would be impossible to understand. Every word sounds as if she's emerging from a coma and doesn't know what she's saying.) Really poor changes include the addition of two silly drug references; obnoxiously sugary, cutesy-poo scenes with Radagast the Brown; at least four endless, pointless CGI sequences designed to tie into theme park rides; and an excessive emphasis on childish humor, of the boogers-and-belching variety.Continued lameness from the movie trilogy includes sword killing that doesn't cause bloodshed, smarmy hugging by characters known for being hard-cased curmudgeons, and the omission of what might be considered negative personality traits in people who used to be complex characters but now must be unconditionally adorable in order not to confuse the simpleminded.This used to be a tale of adventure, showing a spoiled, untried person having his metal refined through hardship and finding inner strength. There was darkness in this story, and truly harrowing moments, and depth for all the lightness. Now it's just a wacky romp designed for maximum marketing.They could have made a really good movie and STILL made a lot of money, but they chose to make an overlong, horribly cartoonish, Keystone Kops ordeal.If you see this movie, and it is eminently skippable, pause during the fight of the stone giants to get a glimpse of the 'real movie' direction they could have taken while keeping the fantasy intact. It's not the shifting mountains with the theme-park-ride sliding, not the New Zealand Tourism Board panoramas, but the beautifully rendered, mountain-tall giants themselves, hurling boulders at each other in mindless elemental rage. The single 'wow!' scene in the movie.Imagine the entire work endowed with meaningful situations and purposeful action.Imagine how much better this movie could have been.",6,11,18,5 January 2013
Prometheus," Pretty. Vacant.
","This movie is like Megan Fox: so stunningly good-looking that you want to fall to your knees in gratitude that you lived to see such a wonder. Then it opens its mouth, and the crushing disappointment sets in. At first you shrug it off -- no one is perfect (physical evidence to the contrary) -- but the dialogue only goes downhill.Ridley Scott still makes a movie so gorgeous that it's emotionally moving. A lush soundtrack only heightens the emotions. But the script! Dan O'Bannon, you are sorely missed. The tight plot, authentic characterization, and closed-room mystery effects of the original 'Alien' are all missing from this beautiful train wreck of a film.In the beginning, characters are established. Some of them are intricate, subtle, and fascinating. None retains any consistency with the set-up. Plot likewise: bad science (not just implausible, but blatantly incorrect to anyone with a grammar school-level grasp of language) leads to stupid decisions which lead to illogical outcomes; it's an avalanche of nonsense, with no plot import or emotional impact. (It doesn't have to be accurate science, or even comprehensible; all it has to do is sound right, and this was easily disproved. So sad.) More questions were asked than answered. More plot threads were opened than tied off. Some really brilliant moves at the beginning of the movie were contradicted for unexplainable reasons, or simply and sadly abandoned. Great characters were built and left undeveloped, unchallenged, untransformed; later they were betrayed by dialogue at odds with their backstory. Unnecessary characters and subplots were added to the mix, muddying the plot and distracting from the (ever thinning, ever dwindling) story line.And when, when did Ridley Scott start with the hamfisted moralizations? Scientists have a couple of lines in this film which are ludicrously inappropriate. Not impossible, but far from believable. Worse, they are carrying on an argument that is awkwardly nailed onto the story...and then, as is the pattern here, abandoned without resolution. This is not the place nor the time for characters to become radios for their makers' opinions, nor to go off on tangents unrelated to the thread.The only reason I rated this as high as seven is that there is a solid skeleton underneath it all, and a beautiful facade on top. But the meat, the real substance of the movie -- plot, story, characters -- putrefy after the set up, with their delicious potential deliquescing before your very eyes.(And if this sounds vague to the point of meaninglessness, full of symbols without referents, it's for the dual purpose of avoiding spoilers, and not going into exhaustive detail. This movie broke my heart in so many ways it would kill me to list even half of them.) That said...yeah, I'll still buy it on DVD, hope for an alternate cut to prop up the cruddy script, and cross my fingers that there will be a sequel. The same hopes I had for this movie.",7,1,3,10 June 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," One long movie would have been much better.
","Part of the problem this movie faced was sustaining tension. It didn't. Nor did it attempt to rebuild tension drained by each scene. Splitting a single book in two was a bad idea to begin with, but this movie not only failed to stand alone, it also failed to live up to the promise of Part I. There should have been a single final movie that matched the book. Part I built tension, and left us all on the edge of our seats, but that tension dissipated, never to be rebuilt.Part II wasted time on dull one-liners to provide comic relief for tension that wasn't there. Also missing were a sense of doom, fear, a burdensome awareness of menace, fatigue, and the need to fight all-out for an uncertain outcome. As there was no sense of fear or doubt or determination, there was nothing to inspire our encouragement or protectiveness -- and certainly no need for relief from tension, since there is none. There is more groundwork laid for the lame one-liners than there is for the story. Since Part I wasted time on similarly extraneous scenes, why not just combine the two and make one long, excellent movie? Other problems: rearranging sequences so results are known ahead of time, which deprives us of surprises; abbreviating scenes to minimize tension, which deprives us of payoff; overstating certain emotional phrases, weakening their impact; writing out-of-character lines for players who don't have enough dialogue to restore their integrity; omitting scenes that add gravity; adding lighthearted mugging at bad times, which is confusing. Is this a do-or-die moment? If so, why are you tittering and shrugging? If not, why is there blood everywhere? There were technical problems (some bad green screen moments, especially) and some weak framing and editing; all this speaks of a rush job. But the weak storytelling and dialogue were what killed this movie.",Null,0,0,16 July 2011
