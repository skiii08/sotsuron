Iron Man 3," Action-packed and plot driven.
","Better plot than the first film, which I found to be generally good with impressive visuals and sound but a little predictable at times. Definitely better than the second, despite only marginally higher ratings here and elsewhere. Some didn't like the amount of time Tony spends out of the suit and dealing with the psychological fallout of the events of The Avengers and its impact on his relationship with Pepper, but I found this to be important character development in establishing his motivations in Age of Ultron. Some also didn't like the way the Mandarin was incorporated, but I found it overall clever and enjoyable. I won't say it's better than the first movie, but it's my personal favorite of the three.",9,1,1,18 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Good overall, but with some issues.
","Great visuals and sound, solid acting and directing. A few problems with the plot, mostly surrounding the use of time travel (can't say more without major spoilers but it's mostly consistency issues). But overall a solid finale to the first three phases of the franchise.",8,2,3,11 May 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One of my favorite films of all time.
","I have two films that have remained my favorites for many years despite having seen many excellent films, The Crow and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. If you don't appreciate non-linear storytelling, I wouldn't recommend this one for you. If you do, I highly recommend it. A beautiful and moving film combining science fiction with a love story that really makes you think.",10,0,0,24 July 2019
