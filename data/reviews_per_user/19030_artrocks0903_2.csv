Blade Runner 2049," Incredible
","Let me just start off by saying what I thought of the original Blade Runner. It's a really good, not great, film that has its problems but is definitely worth watching and re-watching. It's visually amazing, has really good music, and solid performances. Sadly the pacing is what I have a problem with, it feels 30 minutes longer than it really is. Now to my opinion on this film. This is an incredible, beautiful, and just overall well made film. Roger Deakins should finally win the academy award for best cinematography, there is not a single frame I didn't like in this film. The acting was fantastic, everyone did a great job but the stand-out performance for me was Ana De Armas, her character was very interesting and she did a great job portraying that character. The music is fantastic, it never feels like the original score but it's not trying too. This score stands on its own, and so does the film. The pacing never felt bad to me, it's a 2 hour and 43 minute film and it feels like one in the best possible way. I did not have a single problem with this film, it is a masterpiece.",10,5,19,6 October 2017
Alien 3," Whats with the hate?
","WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!Sure its not the action spectacular like the previous film, but it brings the classic alien horror back. The sets may not have looked the best, but with the amount of trouble this movie had with the directors, it was lucky they had anything. And the effects done in this movie aren't cheap CGI effects, its fantastic rod puppetry. After this movie the director made movies like SE7EN and Fight Club, Alien 3 gave him his start. The deep dark feeling and gory effects, it definitely belongs to the Alien saga. The depressing end(I'm not giving away) makes you think 'this is the end of the series'. That is all I can say without giving away the whole movie. I hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope it changed the way you think about this movie.",9,1,1,16 May 2014
