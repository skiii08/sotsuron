The Legend of Bagger Vance," Swing and a Miss
","Given the $60 Million budget and the lofty game/life message, it is likely that Robert Redford was striving to achieve a 'cinema classic' with this film. Unfortunately, professionally crafted movies by well-meaning directors with very ambitious goals often fall short. 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is such a movie. You have to give Redford credit for trying for something extraordinary, but at the end your overriding reaction is that it just didn't work. The upside is that ambitious failures provide excellent opportunities to understand the pitfalls of film-making. While there is little to be learned from failures like Cabin Fever, where little is attempted and even less achieved, a careful analysis of Bagger Vance can be a valuable learning experience. And while analysis can explain why it didn't work, it will not explain why those making the film failed to recognize and correct the elements that ultimately relegate this film to nothing more than a visually interesting period piece. It is well over two hours long (three on television), and while not much happens it isn't particularly dull. The sets are wonderful, the camera work is first rate, sound is fine, and editing/pacing is more than satisfactory. So why doesn't it work? SCRIPT-Beware of adapting a storyline that combines the tenuous idea of golf as a metaphor for life with a nostalgic return to the essence of the sport, and then throws in the standard underdog rising to the challenge in the 'big game'. It simply cannot be done in a movie, these three basic elements get in each others' way. Redford failed for the same reason in 'The Natural' and 'Field of Dreams' was wise enough to stick to only the first two elements and not incorporate the underdog/big game idea. Another flaw (IMHO anyway) is utilizing historical figures in a serious fictional story. Since the events of the story never happened, why are historical characters like Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen dragged into the plot? DIRECTING-Redford's weakness as an actor is also his weakness as a director. Just as he has never played a character that we could really believe in and care about (we wanted 'The Sting' to work but we didn't care what happened to Redford), Redford as a director has never been able to populate his films with real humanity. His focus has always been inanimate detail and mystical reverence. Even Hardy Greaves, the local boy who narrates the story is two-dimensional; which is quite an achievement given the amount of screen time he has and the opportunity afforded by his voice-over narration. CASTING-Will Smith and Matt Damon are way too young to be even remotely believable as a wise mystic and a burned-out veteran. I'm not sure that Will Smith could even be considered an actor so his age is only a secondary problem. While not physically credible, Damon's actual performance is fine-but many of this scenes are opposite Charlize Theron who (as usual) dominates the screen when paired with relative lightweights like Damon. Except for the sets and style there is little to get excited about in this film. The only interesting character/performance is Bruce McGill's (remember D-Day in Animal House) portrayal of Walter Hagen (who would have been better of course as a fictional character). McGill puts actual life into this movie, even as it's moronic golf-as-religion theme bogs it down like a golfer who wades too far into a Georgia tide pool.",5,3,6,5 July 2004
Sucker Punch," Sterile
","Basically 'Sucker Punch' is an $80+ Million laser light show; projected laser beams set to music (in this case nicely produced by Marius De Vries and Tyler Bates). This type of entertainment was quite popular in the theaters during the 1970's (see 'Freaks and Geeks') as a psychedelic entertainment (Pink Floyd, ELO, Blue Oyster Cult). Laser light was useful in entertainment because the coherent nature of laser light allows a narrow beam to be produced, so optical scanning can draw patterns and images on walls, ceilings or other surfaces. Reflected beams can be bounced to targeted positions with mirrors to create laser sculptures. Focused minds are held spellbound by the focused and concentrated light rays. With the advent of computer generated special effects, recreational drugs like ecstasy, and polysubstance use (kitty flipping anyone?); the light show has evolved into a feature film form. 'Sucker Punch' being one of the most ambitious. One segment of the audience connects with this experience and another one does not, then both get on the internet and express disbelief that others are showing so much hate (or love) toward the film. Few find a middle ground as illustrated by the paucity of middle tier votes.In the case of 'Sucker Punch', far more were disappointed than were impressed. Much the same reaction occurred with Tim Burton's 2010 laser light show titled 'Alice In Wonderland'. So if you hated that film you would be wise to avoid 'Sucker Punch'. Although liking Burton's film is no guarantee that you will like 'Sucker Punch', as Burton is a skilled acting for the camera director and there was simply no indication that such a skill set was present during the production phase of 'Sucker Punch'.At about the 25 minute mark of 'Sucker Punch' I was beginning to believe that it was something special. In just 25 minutes the film had taken its main character (nicely underplayed by Emily Browning) through three stages of madness. I was expecting this progression (or descent) into madness to continue in the manner of a high budget and surreal homage to Polanski's 'Repulsion' (1965). That is as a hellbound train that never looks back; with it's heroine's point of view fracturing in a steady progression of more bizarre realities. Unfortunately, 'Sucker Punch's' train spent itself in those early minutes and spends the remainder of the film disappointingly vacillating between the 2nd and 3rd stages of madness, before mercifully bookending itself with a return to the 1st stage.The problem is that by its nature a laser light show lacks or struggles with certain cinematic elements; like audience to character identification, sensuality, suspense, and challenge to the imagination (there is nothing to imagine when the fundamental construct is one of visual illustration). Which is fine if you connect with what it brings (in place of these missing elements) to its audience; like off-kilter production design, dazzling special effects, eye-popping action. But it is important for a viewer to be aware of the nature and limitations of this type of entertainment if they are to avoid frustration and disappointment.Then again, what do I know?

The Big Lebowski," No..No...He Has Health Problems
","'The Big Lebowski' might actually be the funniest film of all time but only if you like its style of humor (parody and subtle off-kilter satire). Even then if you are anything like me you will find it only mildly funny during your first viewing. As others have said it really does get funnier each time you watch it, probably because you have to know the characters to appreciate much of the humor and because during the first viewing you are burning too much mental energy trying to follow the relatively complex plot (while not as complex as 'Miller's Crossing' it still challenges viewers to pay close attention). The DVD does not have a commentary but it does have a short feature full of interviews, where the Coen Brothers explain some of their rationale for certain elements in the script and reveal places where the cast put their own individual marks on the film.'The Big Lebowski' features the Coen's trademark comic style. They are students of films and their secret is taking a traditional character and creating an incongruity between the way you expect the character to talk and behave (as per movie conventions) and what actually happens. For 'The Big Lebowski' the Coen's play with the detective, buddy picture, and the suspense genres. They set up a Philip Marlowe episodic detective story, but as their main character they substitute an aging pot-smoking bowler (Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski played by Jeff Bridges) for the film noir detective. Like Marlowe, the Dude gets caught up in scheme a whole lot bigger than he is and gets episodically pushed and pulled by a lot of strange characters. His buddy Walter Sobchek (John Goodman) is a blustering Viet Nam veteran who manages to further complicate almost every situation. Much of the humor comes from the way the supposedly laid back Dude continually comes unglued over Walter's behavior. Finally the Coens incorporate not one but two Hitchcock MacGuffins into the film. The series of unfortunate events are set in motion by a rug (the floor covering type) and midway into the film it is replaced as a motivating factor by a young woman (Tara Reid). Ultimately neither is of any importance yet they are the reason for everything that happens in the film. New Lebowski fans can be found drinking White Russians, entering their local bowling alley for the first time in years, looking up 'nihilist' in the dictionary, and checking to see if TVLand is showing any 'Branded' reruns. If any of that sounds like fun you should definitely check out the film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",10,0,1,2 August 2006
Monster," A Different Kind of Love Story
","While IMHO 'Monster' is an absolutely amazing film, it obviously is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But the only reasons for criticism are writer/director Patty Jenkins' exploitation of a real-life situation and the perception that serial killer Aileen is portrayed as more of a victim that those she murdered. While there is some logic to those arguments, I think Jenkins actually showed considerable restraint. Exploitation and character identification are inevitable in this type of story. It is more a question of degree-if you compare this to 1990's tearjerker 'Too Young to Die' (starring Juliette Lewis in an almost identical story), Jenkins comes off as a model of objectivity and distanced perspective.What is most unique and compelling about 'Monster' is that it is much more a love story than a thriller or a crime drama. The two main love scenes are absolutely riveting, with intensity levels higher than you are likely to find in any other film. 'Tide Is High' and 'Crimson and Clover' will never sound the same.One thing that works unexpectedly well is the incredible contrast between the two characters. Jenkins works hard to emphasize this, with camera shots that emphasize the physical size differences coupled with dialogue and behaviors that emphasize the contrasting personalities of this odd pair. Having Scott Wilson play the last murder victim is a homage to an earlier 'Mutt and Jeff' pair of murderers, as he played Robert Blake's 'In Cold Blood' sidekick.Although most of the critical acclaim has gone to Theron for her portrayal of Aileen, I think that a lot of the credit for Theron's masterful performance should go to Ricci's subtle and nuanced portrayal of Selby. Watch Ricci's eyes in all her reaction shots, it is as close to acting for the camera perfection as you are likely to ever see.If you really enjoyed Theron's incredible transformation from her typical hot starlet to this gritty prostitute role, then check out Catherine Deneuve in 'Repulsion' (1965) and 'Belle de jour' (1967). While not as physically extreme as Theron's transformation, Deneuve's two characters are equally hard to reconcile as being played by the same actress. Yet another acting for the camera marvel, as wardrobe, makeup, and hair-styling combine with behaviors and speech to effect an amazing range between two characters played by the same actress.",9,2,2,21 August 2005
Underworld," Features on the 2 Disc DVD Make It the Way to Go
","The 'Underworld' sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original. Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget 'mainstream movie' I have seen in years years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in 'The Untouchables', you see an illustration of why less is better; and 'Underworld' expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a 'Godzilla' film.Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest head-splitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in 'Kill Bill Vol.1' (i.e. a delay in the actual detachment-I don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better), the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate, because there are ways to show this (i.e. a line) that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense (although the climax is somewhat surprising). But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint. She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940-ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that: 'This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a rubber suit with especially reflective pants and you have something to anchor your movie'. All this is very true but add intelligence, subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range (you have to watch 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' for the best evidence of that) but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story. I don't understand the comments that are negative overall, or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to, can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.",Null,63,92,1 November 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Lions and Tigers and Emmitt Smiths-Oh My!!!
","Unlike my reaction to most remakes, I was happy when I first heard that they were remaking 'Dawn of the Dead', the story is so irresistible that it could be remade ten times and each would still be entertaining. And I was sure they could do a whole lot better than George Romaro's third installment, the awful 'Day of the Dead'. Seeing the remake did not change my opinion, I found it fun entertainment and better than 'Day'. But I am hoping for still another remake because while better than 'Day', it was not even remotely in the class of 'Night' or the first 'Dawn'. It was about on a par with 'Return of the Living Dead'. Hopefully Romaro's new 'Land of the Living Dead' will be a worthy companion to 'Night' and to the original 'Dawn'..The remake started out well and it worked fine as long as Sarah Polley was the central character, but once they got into the mall the wheels fell off and the whole thing became very ordinary. And I was stunned by how bad the editing was with jump cuts and puzzling gaps in the storyline. While these may have been due to production issues, the lazy hack job done on titles and credits makes the post-production folks the most likely suspects.The biggest controversy is a shuffling zombie vs a running zombie. A single shuffling Romero zombie was not particularly dangerous and it was only a crowd of zombies that posed much of a threat. So having a running zombie helped to close the main plot hole in Romero's films-it never made sense that something that slow and stupid could have taken over. But a shuffler is a far more frightening image because zombies are about entropy, a symbol of individual humans and eventually the entire human order breaking down. Slow rot that eats away everything human in everyone else until it devours you alive. Barely ambulatory supports this fear far better than zombies that run like Emmitt Smith.I did generally enjoy this movie. But the comments on IMDb are far too often of the 'best ever' 'worst ever' type; useless to the prospective viewer. So for the benefit of those viewers I will again say that while the remake doesn't suck, it is extremely flawed and is only a pale shadow of the original. It is silly for us to accept that something this imperfect is anywhere near the best that can be expected from modern horror-especially since the illogic of such a belief is exposed by many classic horror movies, which create better horror and more suspense in subtle ways that does not need to overwhelm us to throughly scare us. So if someone calls this effort a classic, you can safely assume that they have not seen much else that the genre has to offer, or that they are as brain-dead as a zombie (but maybe not as brain-dead as those, and there are some out there, who thought 'Day of the Dead' was the best of Romaro's trilogy).",6,1,2,21 March 2005
The Hunger Games," Excellent Book - Very Ordinary Adaptation
","Like many adaptations, this one leaves you amazed at Lionsgate's staggering contempt for the movie viewing public, a contempt similar to the 'Capital's' contempt for the populations of the 'Districts'; so perhaps their attitude is appropriate.Susan Collins' source novel (she is complicit in this insult as she had a least some part in the adaptation), the first of a trilogy, is the story of an existential heroine (Katniss Everdeen) who performs a single heroic act, volunteering to take the place of her younger sister in the post-apocalyptic games from which the grim trilogy gets its name.But Katniss immediately knows that there was nothing heroic about her action, that her lightening fast decision required no contemplation but was something she was compelled to do. For the rest of the first book (upon which the 2012 film is based) Katniss is buffeted along by mix of free will and destiny, second-guessing each of her decisions and feeling far more guilt than satisfaction over the consequences and (more fundamentally) over her decision to essentially prostitute herself to the Capital in the service of survival.And the reader gets full access to the inner working of her mind because the story is told entirely (100%) from her point of view. This storytelling device shrinks the scale of the story, as a reader never goes out beyond the reach of the first person storyteller. This fosters the sort of reader identification Edgar Rice Burroughs brought to his 'John Carter of Mars' series.Apparently Lionsgate felt that viewers were not up to the mental challenge of Collins' storytelling technique and they converted to a third person POV, going so far as to completely dispense with a voice-over narration by the main character. A puzzling decision since film offers wonderful opportunities for the juxtaposition of objects of contrasting scale.Lionsgate also felt the need to draw in characters and events from the second book in the series (endless scenes of President Snow and signs of the beginning of dissent in the Districts). These immediately destroy the scale unique to the first book and the concept of a faceless enemy, so that the progression of the trilogy from small to vast is compromised. Overt dissent in the Districts appears far too soon in the adaptation, effectively spoiling both the intimacy of the first book and the expansion of the struggle in later books.The film's ham-handed treatment of the story is reflected in Haymitch's explanation for the high score Katness receives after shooting the apple out of the pig's month. He says it is because they liked her guts; but his explanation in the book is that they liked her temper, that this exhibition of her fierceness has made her a player who they believe will bring some heat to the games. Guts are not going to attract sponsors or win the games, nor are they going to incite anyone to revolt. It is a critical change of phrase because throughout the trilogy it is not her courage but her mix of fierceness and humanity that is the difference maker for Katniss, and it is this mix that gives the character the dimensionality necessary for reader identification.Most remarkable, however, is Lionsgate's inexplicable failure to feature the most powerful and most memorable moment in the entire trilogy; the moment Katniss receives the bread from District 11. Arguably the most intense segment ever written. This is really the first book's climatic scene, as Katniss slowly grasps that the bread was originally intended for Rue, with those in her district making a great sacrifice in order to support her. And that after Rue's death they elected to redirect the gift to a participant from another district, the first time in the 70+ year history of the games that such a gesture was made. And the first hint of a unification of the twelve intentionally isolated districts.This is the turning point of the entire story, much like the moment in 'The Magnificent Seven' when the Villagers tell Chris they collected everything of value in their village to hire him and he accepts this small sum, saying: 'I have been offered a lot for my work, but never everything'.Then again, what do I know?

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Some Good Comedy Sequences
","I finally saw this at a theatre this weekend. I love movies but hate theaters. But I was in the middle of three days of eight and under fastpitch softball, it was 95 degrees at the nearly shade-less softball complex, and the small town theater had $4 matinée prices. About midway through I got a headache but that could have been from the 32 ounce slushy rather than the film. Considering this has been out for five weeks there was fairly large crowd in the theater. Basically it was an entertaining film if not as good as the first one. It was really too long (most of the cannibal scenes should have been cut as the film really dragged at this point). The assembly of the film was horrible, making the story hard to follow and failing to build up even a tiny bit of suspense. But it works fine as a comedy. Knightley's character has less screen time than the original and her stuff is more silly than funny. You could say the same for Depp and Bloom as there is more focus on the supporting cast (a good thing in the cases of Davy Jones and the bubbling pair of Black Pearl crewman-a bad thing otherwise). While certainly better than recent CG mega-movie like 'King Kong', the unprecedented attendance is hard to understand. These computer generated action sequences are getting very old and losing their effectiveness with seasoned viewers ('20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' did scarier stuff using rubber tentacles almost 50 years ago) and the CG scenery backgrounds are little better than the old painted backdrops.",7,0,2,6 August 2006
Hostel," Poor Bratislava
","Poor Bratislava and Slovakia, talk about a place getting bad treatment from the movie industry. First it gets 'armpit of the world treatment' in 'Eurotrip', then it gets portrayed as the center of private enterprise torture in 'Hostel'. I saw 'Hostel' on impulse (seeing Tarentino's name after the film title on the theater's list of show-times) without realizing it was the actually the brainchild of Eli Roth, who apparently intended it as a homage to Takashi Miike's 'Audition'. It is an improvement on Roth's boring first movie, 'Cabin Fever'. Although neither movie (Roth's stuff does not rise to the level of an actual film) is even remotely scary, at least with 'Hostel' Roth keeps his tendency toward 'Evil Dead' silliness in check until the last few minutes.Anyway the first half of the film is pretty much a replay of 'Eurotrip's' Amsterdam and train travel scenes, including the funny pervert in the train compartment. I found myself wishing very early in the movie that the three guys were traveling with Michelle Trachtenberg. This wish intensified during the sauna scene in the hostel where the only exploitation elements were a skanky Russian blonde and her fat slug-like friend. The movie would certainly have benefited visually from Trachtenberg's presence or even from the 'Cabin Fever' brunette (despite her nonexistent acting skills she at least looked good). Heck, by this time I would have even settled for Jay Hernandez hooking up with his 'Hang Time' girlfriend Amber Barretto.Anyway the three guys arrive in Bratislava and Roth slowly reveals that it is the home ground of a club that provides its members with people to torture and kill (watch 2002's 'My Little Eye' if you think Roth might actually be doing something original). At this point the thing starts to look a lot more like 'Toolbox Murders' or 'The Driller Killer' than 'Audition' and I began to yearn for an appearance by Angela Bettis. But instead Roth gives us a confused Asian girl who can't speak English very well.Fortunately or unfortunately you never actually identify with those being tortured. But there is at least a point to all the torture as it gives the hero a reason to inflict ultra-violence once the tables are turned and the audience a excuse to mildly cheer every silly development from that point until the movie itself thankfully expires. There was no audience applause at the end as everyone was in a hurry to get out and have some BBQ down the street.To make matters worse for the Slovakia Ministry of Tourism, the one thing Roth manages to do very well is to convey the isolation felt by a tourist in a strange place and the target on the back of Americans in foreign countries these days. Given our image in the eyes of the world these days if such a torture business did exist it is likely that American victims would be in great demand and would command a healthy price premium. There are not just corrupt police but a gang of street urchins who extort gum and candy from visitors.'Hostel's' wide theatrical release and $18 Million marketing campaign (verses just $4 Million production cost) pay homage to P.T. Barnum's comment: 'No one every went broke 'underestimating' the intelligence of the American people'. There is little danger that Roth will ever be mistaken for David Cronenberg. Save your money for the 'Saw II' DVD.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",3,5,10,6 January 2006
The Girl Next Door," Strictly for the Those with Low Brain Activity
","There is a movie viewer segment of such limited intelligence that they have never been able to experience a movie that actually insulted their intelligence. I understand that 'The Girl Next Door' was made as a public service to these viewers and deliberately featured a screenplay so dumbed-down that even those just slightly above the moron level could have their first-ever intelligence insulting viewing experience.Start with a mix of 'Risky Business' and 'Can't Hardly Wait', extract all elements of charm that characterized those films, and then dumb-down the story as a public service to the brain-activity challenged members of the audience; and you have a good description of 'The Girl Next Door'.But it sure has a nice promotional poster. Elisha Cuthbert looks good posing and she does a decent job playing Elisha Cuthbert (who just happens to be 'The Girl Next Door'), but her range as an actress is too narrow to even be measured. Unfortunately for Cuthbert, 'This' girl next door (a part most talented young 'actresses' would love to play) is supposed to be a multi-dimensional character (for those in the target audience this means that the character is really two different people: 'a girl next door' and a 'young but hardened by experience porn star'). If you have seen the movie and are still confused don't be embarrassed, nothing in Cuthbert's performance would lead anyone to believe she is a 'young but hardened by experience porn star'. That is because Cuthbert herself is not a 'young but hardened by experience porn star'. She would have to 'act' differently than 'the girl next door' to communicate this dimensionality to the audience. To do this she would have to be an 'actress'.So give Cuthbert credit for being able to pose for pictures and for being herself-she seems like a very nice girl that I would welcome as my neighbor. For some people that is enough, for those busy with the experience of having their intelligence insulted for the first time it is probably not important. The rest of us we would be hard pressed to find a worse way to spend our time.",3,3,7,15 May 2005
Orphan," In the 'Wicked' Tradition
","If nothing else the disparate viewer reactions to 'The Orphan' make for interesting reading on these comment pages. My advice for potential viewers is to disregard the most extreme love-hate stuff; the film is neither as good nor as bad as a lot of people are saying.It is basically a slightly more bent and graphic version of Julia Stiles' 1998 film 'Wicked'. Both films revolve around ruthless jockeying for household supremacy; both have an erotic subtext that people seem to be afraid to discuss, and both push the envelope of the 'Bad Seed' (1956) genre-reflecting the more extreme attitudes of current fans of the psychological horror genre.'Orphan' has a much bigger budget than the earlier films which is quite skillfully utilized in useful areas like production design and cinematography. It is very creative in these areas and Esther (the latest 'demon seed' nicely overplayed by Isabelle Fuhrman) gets a nice dimensionality from the regular showcasing of her art. The painting of the burning orphanage is especially well done and extremely effective; being as creepy as any visual image I have ever seen.I would certainly recommend the film to fans of 'Wicked' (and vice versa) and to even causal fans of the horror genre. I think it is too extreme for crossover fans, who would be wise to avoid the film or at least to be prepared to bail at some point because it gets increasingly twisted as it progresses. Unless you are willing to suspend disbelief during a number of plot developments you won't enjoy the viewing. It is a bit like 'May' (2002) in this regard, where a lot of viewers enjoy the premise and the set-up but lose interest when the characters get too extreme or too stupid for audience identification.It is a long film (slightly over two hours), which would not be a problem if they had focused more on solving the mystery of Esther's background. Because the film offers viewers minimal cerebral exercises like this, their attention wonders to plot holes and the film begins to get a bit tedious.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

Silent Hill," Some Explanations for Those Who Have Already Watched It
","For a truly unique film experience check out 'Silent Hill'. As a fan of the games I expected to be impressed but anyone looking for innovative film-making and extraordinary (WOW) production design should find this film fascinating. I am firmly convinced that Gans and Avery have hit a home run here. For those who have never seen the game, 'Silent Hill' is the best ever survival/ horror game series. It is difficult and confusing (a lot of mazes and D&D-like details) so expect major disorientation at times during the film-which is a bit like actually playing the game. The acting was convincing, the editing extraordinary, the atmosphere was perfect, the creatures were amazing. Not 100% how I visualized it before viewing but even the differences tended to work in favor of the film. Be prepared for some serious blood. The town itself looked and actually felt familiar, unlike the mess they made of 'House of Wax'. This is definitely the sort of film best seen on the big screen with a theater sound system. Everyone should be totally creeped out. Enough said, more at this stage might spoil things so read on only if you have already seen the film or if you don't mind some spoilers. Dahlia Gillespie had a daughter (by an unknown father) named Alessa. Alessa became the town outcast until a bunch of religious nuts (led by Christabella) decided she was a witch and must be sacrificed to keep evil out of Silent Hill. Dahlia went along with this because she was afraid of her own damnation for having the child. But the ceremony went wrong and the nut cases were not just killed but sent to a netherworld between heaven and hell. The dark side of Alessa ended up in the same place but she was split into duel entities and the good part stayed in the normal world where she was adopted by Rose and Chris, and named Sharon. Sharon's sleepwalking is caused by her connection with Alessa who wants her to return to Silent Hill. On the way to Silent Hill, Rose and Sharon arouse the suspicions of a female motorcycle policewoman (Cybil Bennett). This happens because Cybil has been extremely protective of children since she saved a little boy from a psychopath. Cybil follows them to Silent Hill (once a coal mining town that was abandoned because of a burning seam of coal under the town). At the town limits a mysterious girl appears and both vehicles crash. When Sharon and Cybil regain consciousness Rose is gone. As they explore the abandoned buildings they discover a church with a warning siren where the religious cult hides when Alessa (presumably) causes a darkness to take over the town; for some reason the darkness and Alessa cannot enter the church. It turns out that Alessa sent her Sharon identity back into the world of the living to bring back someone (Rose) who can take her into the church where she can finally exact her revenge. Everyone is dead in the netherworld of Silent Hill, even Rose and Cybil-they don't know it yet but they died in the accident-because you can only enter the town if you are dead. Alessa needs Rose which is why she died, it was just Cybil's bad luck to have been involved in the accident. The tip off to their being parallel towns comes when Rose's husband Chris enters the real Silent Hill and finds nothing supernatural in the place; although he senses a connection with his wife and adopted daughter, he finds no tangible sign of them. Rose passes right through him and the ending scene of Rose and Sharon in their home is blurred, but the scene with Chris in the parallel home is completely clear. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",9,3,6,9 August 2006
Closer," Extreme Characterizations
","'Closer' is a film about four people and the role that truth (or different kinds of truth) plays in their relationships as they try to get closer to themselves and to each other. The mixed reaction from viewers is because while 'Closer' is a nicely packaged film and a fast-paced intelligent screenplay; the four main characters are 'extremes' or at least extreme examples of the behaviors at the allegorical core of the film. These 'expressionistically' drawn characters offend and disappoint the viewer segment expecting realistic and sympathetic portrayals (insert 'characters with whom they can identify' here).But they are extreme because they are intended to illustrate (in obvious ways) certain subtle elements of our romantic relationships. The two male characters, Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen), are products of and participants in the most fundamental Darwinian courtship process. Despite making a pretense of having evolved from the competitive courtship of male primates, they are still driven more by the need to win and secure a trophy than by a quest to love. Likewise Anna, the older female (Julia Roberts), is attracted by the male demonstrations of dominance, both the physical bluster of strength and the mental head games intended to manipulate her emotions. Accordingly her behavior encourages these demonstrations by the males.Contrasted with these three is the younger female (Natalie Portman) who seeks a man who can transcend primitive drives, loving her and allowing her to love him.Into this mix writer Patrick Marber inserts the truth factor in an ironic way. Portman's character places little value on words, adopting a false name at the beginning of the film. That she is superficially living a lie is ironic because she is the only one of the four who does not lie about their true feelings or engage in self-deception. Her transparency and detached self-awareness is symbolized by her job as a stripper.The other three torture themselves and each other with superficial truths while engaging in compulsive deception about their actions and actual feelings, to each other and to themselves. Their duplicity is symbolized by their occupations. Dan is an obit writer, skilled in the use of euphemisms to disguise the unflattering characteristics of the deceased. Anna is a photographer, skilled in freezing a single moment in time uncharacteristic of the actual subject she is representing. Larry is a dermatologist focused on the superficial surface that one publicly presents.The key exchange occurs early in the film as Alice and Dan discuss how essential euphemisms are in his job: Alice: What would my euphemism be? Dan: She was... disarming. Alice: That's not a euphemism. Dan: Yes, it is.Alice's up-front and open behavior causes him to let down his guard and feel a higher level of emotion, but his need to make new conquests and to test his attractiveness soon reasserts itself. She is willing to forgive this until finally convinced that he cannot transcend something so much a part of his basic nature. With that realization she falls out of love.'Closer' is much like 'XX/XY' in its exploration of the mysteries of male discontent although it is philosophically deeper and much better written. Coles (Mark Ruffalo) plays the Dan character in that film, but Law's portrayal is more convincing because he does not have to alternate between rebel and wimp, something that Ruffalo could not quite pull off.All four performances are solid although Roberts is given very little with which to work. Portman is especially good. The problem with 'Closer' is that its symbolic message is not getting through to most viewers (at least it would appear so from the many clueless reviews and comments) who try to relate to it on a literal level. But if you like abstract tales deceptively showcased in a realistic package you should really enjoy this fine film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8,0,0,2 January 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," For Those Still Debating Paying To See This
","Occasionally a film will come along that will leave me feeling totally disconnected from the movie-viewing (or at least the theatre-going) public. This was certainly the case with 'The Bourne Ultimatum' (2007), whose popularity with viewing audiences and critics made me feel like I had grown up in some other culture and never learned the language of films. Because my disconnect was so total I have spent a bit of time reading reviews and comments, trying to pin down the reasons for my 'somewhat' contrarian reaction. I say 'somewhat' not because of my degree of disconnect but because I am not alone in these feelings, a fair number of viewers have had negative reactions as extreme as my own.So for the benefit of those who are thinking about viewing the film here are a few points that may help you predict your reaction.1. Have you seen the first two films? 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is the third film in a popular trilogy based on a series of popular books. I had neither seen the first two films nor read the books. This is a bandwagon I had avoided (my attendance at the third film was almost accidental-I had some time to kill one afternoon and it was the film that was closest to starting when I arrived at the ticket window). I had avoided them despite being a huge Julia Stiles fan, mostly because I dislike Matt Damon almost as much as Titanic Leo. But my reaction to Damon's performance was unexpectedly positive in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' so that turned out to be a non-factor. You probably will enjoy the film more if you know about the franchise and the background of the story. Not so much because it is all that hard of a mental exercise to follow the rather simplistic storyline but because of the second factor I am about to discuss.2. Can you identify with the Jason Bourne character? I think this was a key reason for my own disconnect. Presumably most of those who who buy a ticket bring a ready-made identification with them, carried over from the first two films. If you don't already have it, don't expect it to happen during film three. At no point did I like, admire, or identify with this character; but I might have had I met him in the earlier films. 3. Can you suspend disbelief during action/conspiracy films that do not feature characters with superpowers or supernatural intervention, where a character exhibits implausible physical prowess? For me personally the Bourne franchise was doomed because of my inability or stubborn refusal to accept silly action sequences that have no credibility. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' reminded me a lot of 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' without that film's element of humor. And while this exercise in excess is sometimes tolerable in obvious parody films like 'Ultraviolet' or maybe not (insert 'Electra' here), it just puts me to sleep when it is supposed to be taken seriously. My guess is that if you enjoyed Ronin' (1998), 'The Ipcress File' (1965), and 'Enemy of the State' (1998); you will find the 'Bourne' movies generally moronic.4. Do you feel like a displaced person during your occasional visit to your local mega- multi-plex? Outside of some college towns you have to look long and hard to find anyone but wiggers and drones standing in line for Hollywood's latest saturation booked products. I'm not talking about the occasional family film or chick flick, but rather the standard dumbed-down blockbuster (both those that do well at the box office and those that tank). If so you have probably formed the same sort of theories about the sub-group of society that represent the target audience for this stuff and there is no need for me to elaborate. 5. Are you a big fan of computer generated sequences, fast editing, and production techniques that call attention to themselves? Most of the critical comments about 'The Bourne Ultimatum' at least mention its reliance on 'unsteady cam' filming and flurry editing. Like 'The Blair Witch' stuff, these techniques are deliberately employed to create a subconscious disorientation in viewers; it is not the result of poor cinematography or cheap post-production work. Unfortunately they are done to such excess that they quickly call attention to themselves which tends to undermine any impact they might have had on the subconscious. Also, they are lazy ways to stage and to film action sequences, making most of this stuff on the authenticity level of 'Electra'. Unlike 'The Third Man' and 'East of Eden', where odd camera angles reinforce off- kilter 'moments' in the story, the pervasive use of this stuff means that there are no normal scenes with which it can be contrasted.Hopefully these five points will help you to determine in advance whether you should hit the theatre for this production. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",2,5,11,8 September 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," Underrated
","'10 Things I Hate About You' (1999) is probably the all-time most ambitious of the teen comedies. Updates of classic literature like this have become relatively common; 'Emma' is adapted as 'Clueless', 'Othello' as 'O', 'Pygmalion' becomes ''She's All That'', etc. etc. '10 Things I Hate About You' is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew' (which has also been adapted as the Broadway musical and film 'Kiss Me Kate'.The strange title is less Shakespeare derived than a play on the Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnet that begins ''How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.'' Even knowing this, the title withholds its relationship to the film content until the climatic scene late in the film when Katerina (Julia Stiles) reads her poem (in iambic pentameter) to the class: 'I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all'. Either the producers can't count of they didn't like the sound of '13 Things I Hate About You' The film was fairly popular at the time of its release and made a considerable amount of money, but critical reaction was mixed. Most of the negative reviews came from critics who felt the film was too distanced from the original; specifically that Katerina was not Shakespeare's mega-shrew and that her taming was just too tame. While these observations are correct, in this case toning down the original makes the film work better. A less gritty story allows for more lyrical storytelling and better a unity with the great pop soundtrack and the inventive cinematography. And few will miss the original's out-of-control misogyny. The film goes out on fantastic rotational helicopter shot of the group 'Letters from Cleo' as they perform the closing song on top of spectacular Stadium High School in Tacoma. The story begins with obstetrician Walter Stratford's (Larry Miller) grudging agreement to allow his younger daughter Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) to date if her older sister Katerina (Stiles) starts dating. Walter's occupation has made him super-paranoid about teen pregnancy, but he feel quite safe with this compromise because Katerina is a brain with little interest in boys and an abrasive enough personality to drive away anyone who might be attracted to her. Miller and Stiles are exceptional in these roles, the best performances of their careers. Oleynik (formally Alex Mack) does not have nearly as much to work with but is solid in her role. My main criticism is that the film has the same dynamic as 'Some Kind of Wonderful', with the abrasive tomboy significantly more desirable than the foxy girl every guy is after. Back in her 'Alex Mack' days Oleynik was the #1 ranked female in a People Magazine survey of the most beautiful person in the world. I don't see it and I'm pretty sure that I have a lot of company. One interesting bit of trivia is that Oleynik went on to attend and graduate from Sarah Lawrence College, the school that Katerina wants to attend in the film. Female viewers will generally be pleased with Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona (afterall the action takes place at Padua High School), who is hired by two of Bianca's admirers to tame the shrew. Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) is the obnoxious pretty boy who is cruising for his comeuppance throughout the film; but he is not close to the bad guy standard set by 'Some Kind of Wonderful' and Pretty in Pink'. Allison Janney is hilarious as a porno-writing guidance counselor. I really liked the tentative feeling between Patrick and Katerina. In one of the most enjoyable scenes he appears in the grandstands while she is at soccer practice and sings ''I Love You Baby'' over the P.A. system, having bribed the school's marching band to accompany him down on the field.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8,1,1,16 July 2007
The Aviator," Has Martin Scorsese lost it?
","The master of the small movie apparently wants to be the master of the epic film. Unfortunately this is a tall order for anyone, especially for someone who hasn't made a particularly good film (small or epic) since 1990. But at least this time he is trying for a masterpiece and not just pissing away his time with garbage. There will be inevitable comparisons with 'Citizen Kane' (in fact at one point in the film a reference is even made to W.R. Hearst) but anyone who does so should get a reality check. A more appropriate side-by-side comparison would be Tim Burton's 'Ed Wood', and this is a comparison that 'Aviator' loses.Which is not to say that 'Aviator' is a bad movie, although certainly it is bad history and is in need of major trimming, it is at least entertaining to watch. One wonders, however, if it will fare well enough at the box office to justify its epic expense. It has a relatively small initial target audience and nothing about the final cut makes one think it will generate word-of-mouth appeal from the wider population.There are a number of flying scenes and two are very good, the night landing on a golf course and the take-off of the Spruce Goose. There are also two that are very weak. The worst is the setting of a new speed record which has a serious continuity error, the plane on the runway was clearly not the plane in the error (bad pun intended). This was so obvious (one had a partial canopy and one had a full canopy) and they cut back and forth so much that I wondered if I was hallucinating the disparity-hard to believe that it was not handled better. The other was the crash of the spy plane in a Hollywood neighborhood. The cartoonish shots of various homeowners watching their houses being destroyed from the inside would fit a Cohn Brothers comedy but are totally out of place in this film.The film has one great performance, Cate Blanchette channels the vocal patterns and mannerisms of Katherine Hepburn, her scenes are the highlights of the film and fortunately she has a lot of scenes. It took a lot of courage for Scorsese to not just structure the film around someone as familiar as Hepburn but to have her character played in a manner where she was recognizable to her fans.Alan Alda does great as a slimy senator, Adam Baldwin is slick as thestrangely likable Pan Am President, Kelli Garner and the other Kate (Beckinsale) are dazzling decoration, and Ian Holm provides comic relief. Apparently Scorsese felt he needed this high caliber ensemble to compensate for miscasting the lead.And miscast he is; from DiCaprio's first line you know that this will be a painful experience; although perhaps not quite as horrible as you would expect from his prior work. Since Scorsese's break with De Niro after Cape Fear, both director and actor have suffered. You have to believe that the replacement DiCaprio takes direction well and that Scorsese is gambling that he can hit a home run with a weak actor and not have to share the credit for his triumph. But his strategy does not work as their screen version of Hughes utterly fails to capture any of the personal magnetism of their subject. I left the theatre thinking how well Titanic Leo executed the role, for his attempt was clearly earnest; but that almost any real actor could have brought nuances to the part well beyond the scope of DiCaprio's abilities-even under Scorsese's direction. The weakness of his portrayal is not as obvious when he is the only one in a scene but it takes on varying degrees of glaring when he is paired with one of the better members of the supporting cast.I kept coming back to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ed Wood and wishing it was he who was playing Hughes. In real life Wood was a strange guy but almost one-dimensional when compared to Hughes. But if your only exposure to them was these movie biographies you would think that Wood was far more intriguing.",6,35,70,25 December 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," Comparisons to the 'Original'
","Viewers will be happy to know that the remake of 1977's 'The Hills Have Eyes' maintains the hokey fake binocular point of view device. Ever notice how those two circles with the black borders used for movie POV purposes are not what you actually see when you look through a pair of binoculars (there are no circles in there). I had the luxury of watching the two films at the same time. I would run 15 minutes of the remake first and then she same15 minutes of the original. Roger Ebert contends that it is a loose re-make; I disagreed until well past the midway point of the story. Until then it pretty much followed things scene for scene, with minor updates to reflect 2006 rather than 1977. The bill for a tank of gas was under $10 in the original. They chose to alter the back-story; in the original the gas station owner had spawned the original creature back before WWII and he tries to persuade the family to stay on the main road. In the remake the creatures are products of atomic testing and the gas station owner is paid by them to divert people off the main road. The introduction of the old atomic testing device allows the production design people to create a government built fake town left over from the testing. It is populated with old mannequins originally placed there to show the effects of a nuclear blast. This set is a nice addition to the original and the biggest deviation or the remake. Not so effective is a 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' field of abandoned cars and trucks (belonging to prior victims); mostly because the device has become almost obligatory to these familial horror stories (insert 'Wrong Turn' here). In the original this was an off camera Air Force dump site from which the son-in-law salvaged some equipment. Making this a textbook example of why showing nothing is sometimes better showing something. My reaction until well after the midpoint was that the remake was better. It was very respectful of original and the higher budget and technical improvements meant better film stock, more elaborate camera work, and better audio. Neither cast is exactly full of heavyweight talent. The new higher budgeted group might actually be more talented but Craven is a much better acting for the camera director than Aja; so the acting advantage clearly goes to the original (who also seemed to be having a lot more fun with their material). The remake falters (relative to the original anyway) for the last third of the film. In large part this is because Aja failed early on to define and adequately develop personalities for the mutant family. This was the real strength of the original as the family in the hills was quickly identified and their internal relationships developed. They took a gleeful pleasure in their mayhem and Craven kept them in character throughout the production. The remake is inconsistent, at times it tries to make them more sympathetic and at other times more primitive and savage. Plus it adds a non-ambulatory character like that in 'TCM' and 'Monster Man'. Unfortunately here he serves no purpose other than as an excuse to employ more people in the make-up unit. Finally, the remake lacks the original's best visual image, Michael Berryman's hairless asymmetrical head which was featured on the poster and video cover art. Berrymore's characterization of 'Pluto' became a cult figure with his groveling and whining. Michael Bailey Smith's new 'Pluto' does not begin to measure up to Berryman's. The remake's best visual image is a superior 'Ruby'; Laura Ortiz manages an expressive performance that is both wistful and eerie-nice job. It appears that Aja incorporated parallels between the two families but few will notice and even less will care. I say 'appears' because somewhere between production and release this stuff was so haphazardly assembled that it lost all sense of unity and purpose. Then again, what do I know?

Van Helsing," An Updated 'Fearless Vampire Killers'
","Of great entertainment value are the 'Van Helsing' comments and message board postings from people who apparently just don't get it. Parody/satire of horror films has a long tradition and ranges from the obvious (see Abbott & Costello, Mel Brooks, and 'Redneck Zombies') to the subtle (see 'The Fearless Vampire Killers' and 'Evil Dead'). Before reading many of the comments I would have grouped 'Van Helsing' closer to the obvious, after all the film depicts a Vatican Department modeled on James Bond's Special Weapons 'Q' Section. But apparently even something so obvious is not registering with many people, if the true measure of a 'subtle' satire is how many people just don't get it, then 'Van Helsing' certainly qualifies.They went into this project saying something like: 'let's use digital effects and a large budget to create the most interesting sets in horror movie history, and then use these as a backdrop for a parody of the 'horror genre'. When concerns were raised about the expense for just a comedy, they pitched it as a sophisticated parody that would not get in the way of the average viewer's desire to see a traditional vampire movie. Such a dichotomy allows the movie to generate big bucks at the box office while still providing its makers with an outlet for their creativity. But such a dichotomy means there will be a third group of viewers who cannot suspend belief enough to enjoy it as a horror film and yet will totally miss the parody angle (the only question is whether they too humorless to find enjoyment in such frivolity or are just a little too dim to appreciate it). We see a lot of negative comments from this third group but 'f them if they can take a joke'-or don't get a joke.The movie opens with a visually awesome scene of the villagers storming a huge castle and burning a windmill; the sets and the music are great. Except for the overacting and the presence of an assistant named 'Egor' or 'Igor' (see Mel Brooks reference), you would not suspect that this is anything but a serious horror film. Actually at first I thought it might be a high budget commercial and kept thinking Dracula would say he had gotten a great deal on his car insurance. Although this was the best scene in the movie there were several almost as good and each one had a similar restrained level of satire.The film plays homage to the Karloff/Chaney films, to Abbott and Costello, Mel Brooks, James Bond and The Wild, Wild West. There is a little Phantom of the Opera and even Eli Wallach's best line from 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' (if you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk). In fact they even lift the vampire ballroom scene from 'The Fearless Vampire Killers'.The individual performances are from the William Shatner School of Over-Acting with Dracula's brides totally stealing each scene in which they are featured. I particularly liked Josie Maran (who had that great scene as the cigarette girl in 'The Aviator') as Marishka. The costumes are almost as good as the sets. The computer-generated action sequences illustrate all the problems with digital effects, but work fine as satirical devices.So if you want to see a fun film with unparalleled visuals this is the one. Others who can suspend belief and ignore a few campy elements will enjoy it as a straight vampire picture. But if you are can't suspend belief, are humorless, or don't know the horror genre you should stay away. Because there are really two movies here, the first viewing withholds most of the viewing pleasure; once you understand what is happening repeated viewings are even more fun.",7,0,1,26 March 2005
Saw III," Some Useful Information for 'Potential Viewers'
","Now that the Halloween ritual is over, so is the only good reason to see 'Saw III' at a theatre. So here are some observations for those reading these comments while trying to decide whether they should pay good money to see the movie. First off look at the situation objectively, by its third installment the 'Saw' franchise has become what the film industry refers to as a 'pre-sold' product. This means that during the pre-production phase it was known that virtually anything released to theatres with the title 'Saw III' will do substantial business. For those (including myself) who enjoyed the first two, it would be a much-anticipated Halloween ritual. We would purposely not read comments or reviews (or even view trailers) to insure a completely pure viewing experience. Our tickets were essentially sold before 'Saw II' had closed at our local mega-plex. Although these economics guaranteed the production of the third installment (and apparently a fourth one), they provide no incentive for producing a film worthy of the preceding two. The original entry had to be good or suffer a 'direct to video' fate, and the second benefited from (but was not over-whelmed by) a more professional production process because of its higher budget. In addition for the second one there was considerable incentive to prove that the first was not a lucky fluke. Further red flags go up when you see that 'Saw III' is using a 'worldwide' saturation booking technique normally reserved for weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre- release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theatres (3167 in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide). This is normally done with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance. If a film is good it will be exhibited more discreetly because the producers are counting on positive 'buzz' to promote attendance and reduce marketing costs. Finally, the critics have overwhelmingly trashed 'Saw III', even those who were extremely positive about the first two. So as a potential (not a pre-sold viewer), you get on this site and sift through the comments to try to get a handle on the quality of the film while avoiding major spoilers; and you find an extremely divergent set of comments. My advice is to dig a little deeper into the source of the comments, click to see the comment history of each author. It is generally a good idea to give more weight to the more prolific writers-especially those whose comments about other films mirror your reactions. In the case of 'Saw III', the extremely positive (and least detailed) comments on the IMDb are almost exclusively from people for whom this is their first comment. If this seems extremely odd and if you are into conspiracy theories, you should at least consider the possibility that these are planted as part of the film's marketing campaign. As for myself, I cannot imagine anyone who has not seen the first two films getting much enjoyment out to the third. Although there were times during the viewing process where I wished I was in this group because at least the confusion would have provided some degree of mental challenge during what turned out (IMHO) to be an extremely boring feature. Nor would I expect anyone who did not get off on blood and gore to find this an enjoyable experience. The 'Saw' films are in the horror sub-genre made famous by Dario Argneto and Mario Bava. This is called the 'gialli' (yellow) style. These two Italian makers of horror/ thrillers place a huge emphasis on the deed of murder whereas other styles emphasize the solving of the murder. Inherent in this style is almost constant self- parody, necessary to expand the target audience beyond the wiggers and drones who flock to the local mall. The parody element fundamental to the first two installments is in short supply in 'Saw III', deliberately inserted into only one scene-the pig rendering trap.Checking my watch every ten minutes I kept hoping that something would happen to give an interesting tilt to what I had already seen, as had happened in the first two. But by the midway point I had abandoned this (not the checking of my watch but the expectation that any magician could pull a rabbit out of this lame hat). Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",3,19,38,1 November 2006
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Good Fun
","If you are thinking about viewing this film, imagine if Richard and Danny Elfman's expressionistic film 'Forbidden Zone' (1980) was effectively blended with 'Napoleon Dynamite'(2003), 'Malice In Wonderland' (2009), and 'Sky High' (2005). If you liked any or all of those three films you should enjoy 'Scott Pilgrim vs The World'. American audiences have historically been highly resistant to expressionism and it is interesting how that style is now finding an audience in the gamer and comic book crowds, apparently computer generated special effects have effectively kicked down the barriers that have long kept us trapped in the realism style.I came to this film as a fan of Alison Pill and was not disappointed, she appears to be having a lot of fun playing a variation of Mary Stuart Masterson's 'Some Kind of Wonderful' (1987) character; although Alison gets to deadpan much funnier lines.And Mary Elizabeth Winstead should get some credit for putting herself out there in some unconventional stuff like this and Tarantino's 'Death Proof' (2007). It is rare for an actress to take these kind of chances but it is a good way to avoid type casting.My only complaint is that much of the $60Million budget does not seem to make it to the screen, the film would probably have worked better as a more minimalist production. The computer generated stuff simply has no charm and you just want to fast forward through the silly fight sequences.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",6,1,2,28 December 2011
Enchanted," Very Amusing
","Think of Disney's 'Enchanted' (2007) as part 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937) and part 'Prince Charming' (2001), with a bit of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' (1988) thrown in for good measure. But its real predecessor is Walt Disney's very first production 'Alice's Wonderland' (1923). Contrary to popular belief Walt's first sustained character was neither Oswald the Rabbit nor Mickey Mouse. It was a six-year old real life girl named Alice. While working for an advertising agency in Kansas City Walt altered a concept from Max and Dave Fleischer's 'Out of the Inkwell' series and mixed a live actress (Virginia Davis) with animation.'Enchanted' is all about the juxtaposition of the real world with the animated world. Animated characters become their real life counterparts, and then turn back into pop-up book scenes. As in 'Prince Charming', a storybook prince finds himself dealing with modern day Manhattan. But this time he is has come to this strange world voluntarily.It seems that his stepmother (Susan Sarandon playing a high mileage version of Snow White's Evil Queen) has transported his future bride Giselle (Amy Adams) to the real world. Adams is quite simply amazing in this role. She has no trouble selling her character's wide-eyed innocence (this is literally true-just watch her eyes). Giselle works her magic on a cynical divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his six- year-old daughter. Although the film has no weak scenes I found myself trying to hurry along the portions that did not feature Adams. There are some relatively subtle sight gags; watch for the difficulties Giselle has maneuvering her huge Princess gown around the real world. Also watch for Adams' two musical numbers, 'Happy Working Song' and 'That's How You Know'. These are absolutely priceless and compare favorably with the cinema's best musical moments.'Enchanted' might have the decade's widest target audience as it has almost universal appeal. My only criticism is that the effects loaded climatic scene is not nearly as entertaining as the sequences that precede it. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",9,1,1,4 December 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Wise Up People
","War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment. An exception to this war-in-progress concept was is 'Saving Private Ryan'. Cloaked in an anti-war facade, this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 (its setting) than 1998 (its year of release). Under its thin anti-war facade of realistic looking destruction, Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an anti-war work. Almost by definition anti-war films use a faceless enemy ('Paths of Glory') or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war ('The Enemy Below'). Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them ('The Longest Day'). This is because after a war, both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined, otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan; if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced, a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how, facing such a totally inept enemy, the war could have gone on more than a few days after the D-Day Landings. Among the most obvious:A sequence where American soldiers run back and forth in front of a Tiger I tank without drawing the fire of the tank's machine guns. These tanks had internally operated machine guns, which would have easily cut down these soldiers. Knowing this the soldiers would not have exposed themselves to this fire. Tanks entering an urban area ahead of infantry, driving down the middle of the town as if on parade. Instead infantry would flank any defensive position on the street and secure the area immediately ahead of the tanks so they do not come into range of anti-tank weapons. These tactics were validated during early fighting on the Russian front and became operational imperatives for all Panzer units. A Hitler Youth dagger found in the trench right after the first bunker is taken on the beach. The men in these bunkers were mostly older second-tier draftees and Ukrainian conscripts. Normandy was not expected to be the invasion target and it's highly unlikely that a member or former member of the Hitler Youth would have been assigned to these marginal units. But it was an excellent way to make the audience less squeamish about the brutality inflicted by the allied soldiers when these German units attempted to surrender.So just what is 'Saving Private Ryan'? The first 24 minutes are a high budget remake of the 'Longest Day' whose less expensive landing sequence conveyed more tactical believability about the process of securing a beachhead. The next 90 minutes are a mistake-ridden, choppy, and contrived remake of 'The Big Red One'. Ultimately, this overlong odyssey said less about patrolling behind enemy lines than 'Kelly's Heroes'- a counterculture comedy whose serious scenes and character development were superior in almost every way. Then there is the finale, a total rip-off of Arthur Pohl's 'The Bridge' (1949), which focused on a handful of recently conscripted German schoolboys who fight for control of an inconsequential bridge during the last weeks of the war. They were at the bridge because of a series of accidents and they naively stayed there because of their youthful idealism and sense of duty. Like Private Ryan, most do not survive the engagement. What is notable is not that Pohl was able to make a much better film for a fraction of the cost (that is not particularly unusual), but that he was able to convey more perspective four years after the event than Spielberg could manage 50 years later.But these criticisms of Private Ryan are based on the assumption that Spielberg's intent was to make a worthwhile war film and there is simply nothing to support this assumption. More likely Spielberg's agenda was make money while subtly refuting post-war portrayals (such as 'Das Boot' and 'Cross of Iron') of the German soldier as something more than the sub- human creature of WWII propaganda days or the cartoon villains of his own 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' series. The genius of Private Ryan is its success in packaging this sick message inside a commercially successful film. At the time of its release and its almost universal acclaim, this aspect of the film was largely unrecognized (and unexamined) by both audiences and critics. In this respect it owes less to the war films it shamelessly plagiarizes than to early 1950's cinema, where McCarthy-paralyzed Hollywood directors resorted to subtle themes that went undetected by studio executives and regulators. Only recently has its status begun to erode as individual critics more carefully examine its elements, away from the euphoria that surrounded its initial releaseAlthough 'Saving Private Ryan was popular, remember that the 'Rat Patrol' ran for 58 episodes, watched by television audiences who were also entertained by similar silly nonsense.Then again, what do I know?

Cars," Get Your Kicks 'Off' Route 66
","An allegorical homage to early 1960's televisionDon't be put off by the previews for 'Cars' (and the cast and crew interviews on the Disney channel) which make the story look rather lame. This is a movie to see the day that it opens, experience it in the company of an enthusiastic audience of first time viewers. No surprise that it is slickly written and well executed, it is a Pixar Films' production, almost a seal of approval for those who want to be sure they get something for their admissions dollar.The animation is great, definitely the best they've done. Giving distinct personality and character to a normally inanimate object is nothing new but it has never been more effective. Not only do the cars communicate emotion, but the star (Lightning McQueen-a hotshot rookie race car with the voice of Owen Wilson) illustrates moments of character revelation and change better than most contemporary flesh and blood actors. They load the movie with just enough automotive insider jokes to let race fans feel privileged but not so many that other viewers feel left out.Speeding cross-country to race in the big Piston Cup Championship in California Lightning McQueen gets hung up in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. Much like Tod and Buz in an episode of television's 'Route 66', the layover allows time for him to interact with the town's offbeat characters including Doc Hudson (a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past and Paul Newman's voice) and Mater (for Towmater-a rusty but trusty tow truck). Although it would have been nice to have included the voices of the original 'Route 66' stars Martin Milner and George Maharis, there is enough here to suggest that the baby boomer demographic was one of the film's target audiences. Making it the perfect film for kids to drag their grandparents to, even if it is the first movie the boomers have seen in years. Lightning eventually learns that life is about the journey, not a destination or the finish line.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",9,4,6,7 June 2006
Coyote Ugly," Breaking the Code
","Dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldn't find his car.Breaking the code-A very rich father is almost nagged to death by his spoiled daughter, who wants to see her marginal screenplay about her adventures in the NY club scene made into a movie. He finally agrees to bankroll the project on the condition that she turns over all actual production decisions to a competent production company. The production group casts a pair of likable actors and get John Goodman to play a supporting role. They target the Britney segment of the Lifetime movie audience with a teen angst/struggling artist story-line. They also go after a large secondary audience-those (of both sexes) who like to watch hot women in tight pants. They have a large enough budget to staff the project with an excellent crew although they skimp on production design, supporting cast talent, and editing. They make a movie called Coyote Ugly and successfully market it to their target audiences. If you are part of their secondary target audience it is best to watch it on DVD so you can avoid any scenes devoid of tight pants.Problem--Nothing happens. This story is so tired only the worn down father of the screenwriter would dream of making it into a movie, and just on the long shot that his daughter would move out of the house and get a real job once she had a writing credit on her resume. The Olsen twins, credited as someone named Piper Perabo; play Violet, a young songwriter who makes the BIG journey all the way from New Jersey to New York City to realize her dream. Olsen Twin Violet has stage fright but immediately meets the nicest boy in NYC - an Australian (played by Adam Garcia) who collects comic books, thinks he saw her in a television show with Lori Loughlin, works an assortment of entry-level jobs, and still has time to truly care about her. Supermodel Tyra Banks appears on the screen a few times but does not have to act or to play an actual 'character'.",4,0,1,5 February 2005
Transformers," Discovering Japan
","The 'Transformers' concept is of course Japanese, but the origin predates the animated television show that originally aired in the U. S. from 1984 to 1987. The idea actually goes back to the post WWII 'Godzilla' series. The Japanese were able to turn the big green fellow into a franchise by producing a series of sequels with titles like: 'Godzilla vs ???' (Mothra, Biallante, Cosmic Monster, King Ghidorah, Magalon, The Smog Monster, etc. etc.). Japanese producers had discovered a universal appeal in combat between a somewhat good monster/ alien and a clearly bad one. Arnold the Barbarian's 'Terminator' sequels also picked up on this can't miss idea.Director Michael Bay has latched onto this idea as a way to arrest his career decline. Normally repeated disasters on the scale of 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Armageddon' would result in banishment from Hollywood and a subsequent career making educational films in Des Moines. But somehow Bay was able to convince them to use him for this project. Apparently having crashed and burned (spectacularly) in many of his prior efforts, gave Bay a fair degree of perspective and he is able to have a lot of self-reflexive fun with 'Transformers'; a goofy film with a lot of stuff that blows up it neat ways and does not take itself nearly as seriously as the original series. In fact it should appeal to 'Godziilla' fans who find this quasi-parody quality endearing. In place of Godzilla and Mothra et al the film features Computer Generated Transformer toys that contort and expand from something normal into robot monsters. The head monster, who speaks with the voice of Earthquake McGoon, is a bad boy named Megatron. He is the most fearsome of the evil Decepticons robots, who are at odds with the nice robots (Transformers). Both brands of robots fled the doomed planet Cybertron and came to Earth. There is a fairly explicit reason for their choosing Earth (called the Allspark) but for it is not important that casual viewers fully understand the details. Initially 'Transformers' is a teen movie, with the familiar loser teen boy (Sam played by Shia LaBeouf) lusting after the hot girl (Mikaela-not the one on 'Star Search' but Megan Fox who played snobby Carla in 'Confessions of Teenage Drama Queen') who does not know that he exists. Fox has aged noticeably since 'Drama Queen' and is fading uncomfortably fast, but she still looks good enough that scorching your eyeballs is a real possibility.In an attempt of improve Sam's social standing at school (and to advance the storyline), his Dad gets him a Camaro which turns out to be a Transformer named Bumblebee. Having a transforming car causes Mikaela to notice Sam at about the time the film itself transforms from teen movie to battling robot Sci-Fi. Enter the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) , the armed forces or at least Sgt. Lennox (John Duhamel) and Tech Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and a secret agent (Coen Brothers favorite John Turturro). Like the 'Godzilla' franchise the best efforts of the military make little impression on the robot monsters. Bay builds up the suspense level as things move toward an epic battle between the Transformers and the Decepticons that will decide the fate of the world. Unfortunately the wheels start to fall off the film at this point as it goes into the 'exercise in excess' mode of stuff like 'Ultraviolet' and King Kong'. The Industrial Light and Magic effects are not at fault as their digital creations are first class. There is plenty of attention to detail and the movements and battle sequences are individually excellent. The problem is that the whole is considerably less than the sum of its parts. A situation that is only tolerable if you begin viewing things from the self-parody angle; which I think was actually Bay's intention all along. As Roger Ebbert notes: 'The mechanical battle goes on and on and on and on, with robots banging into each other and crashing into buildings, and buildings falling into the street, and the military firing, and jets sweeping overhead, and Megatron and the good hero, Optimus Prime, duking it out, and the soundtrack sawing away at thrilling music, and enough is enough.'It's really time for these CGI dominated movies to mature and start choreographing their scenes to be more than just eye candy. A logical fight strategy would be nice, something that makes sense and is not just random violence. The 'Transformers' violence looks like it was lifted from old scripted bouts of 'Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling'; with the combatants often down but never out. The failure to incorporate logic distances the audience from the action and makes it impossible to build any real suspense. For this reason alone, the film would have benefited from some serious action scene trimming and a more logical assembly in the editing room. Computer animation has become far cheaper than actually staging live-action sequences but audiences are increasingly discounting these scenes-viewer thrills don't happen when viewers are wise enough to see it as animation. Current audiences are finding it increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief. The same thing occurred in the 1960's when audiences began recognizing the projected backgrounds used for scenes shot in the studio. This started a trend toward shooting films on location with only television shows still using the sound stages. But this excess is the film's only real fault and since it comes at the end most of the viewing experience is quite enjoyable. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",7,1,5,15 July 2007
Empire Records," The Time to Hesitate is Through
","Trying to contribute something useful to prospective viewers means trying to explain the extremely polarized nature of the comments about 'Empire Records'. An uninitiated reader would think that the love-it and hate-it groups were talking about two different films. Which is actually a relatively accurate take on the situation. Allan Moyle's films may differ in subject and structure, but they all have the same indefinable quality that literally connects them to a segment of viewers. This is not the same thing as 'getting it' which you would use explain the positive/negative reactions to 'Dr. Strangelove', 'Nashville', or 'Clockwork Orange'.The connection process is more subtle, and it doesn't seem to matter whether you are watching 'Times Square', 'Pump Up the Volume', 'New Waterford Girl', or 'Empire Records'. An earlier comment came close to capturing this quality: '.....watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts.....'. The point being that if you have ever connected with a Moyle film you will most likely connect with 'Empire Records' and will see an entirely different film that those not so lucky.What about those with no prior exposure to Moyle? Think of 'Empire Records' as the 'American Graffiti' of the 90's, a similar 'one-day' structure and a cast of relatively unknown young actors destined to make it big. Structurally it's a microcosm movie like 'The Big Chill', as almost all the action takes place in the same location and the day being portrayed is not a routine one but an extraordinary one (it's Rex Manning day). Not all fans of 'Ghost World' and 'Can't Hardly Wait' will enjoy 'Empire Records' but it is probably safe to say that if you hated those two films you should avoid 'Empire Records'.It has a happy ending with characters you like and identify with, and the small world of the record store functions as family and universe for these characters. There are lots of little things that you only pick up on after repeated viewings. I'm convinced that the over-the-top stuff works (i.e doesn't come across as totally lame) because Moyle and his editor have carefully set things up on a subconscious level. For example when Corey is agonizing about opening her Harvard admissions letter, they cut between her and attentive shots of both AJ and Gina, who are standing near her to be supportive despite having mixed feelings about her going away. They are the two people who care the most about her. Which furnishes the viewer with the information to understand the nature of her meltdown later in the film, she comes unglued not about Rex Manning but with the sudden realization that her preoccupation with herself has alienated the two people she cares about the most.My favorite sequence is when Joe tracks down Deb (Robin Tunney) who has retreated from everyone and is sitting on the floor of one of the listening booths doing the store's tax return, symbolic of the protective niche she has found working in the store for Joe. In an extremely touching scene Joe finally just tells her that she is doing a good job. Tunney nicely underplays her character's gentle sarcasm during their exchange, but there is a huge dimensionality in her responses that perfectly communicates her connection to Joe and the store. So that in about 30 seconds Moyle has set up a believable explanation for the sacrifice Deb will later make to help save them.My second favorite sequence is a montage of activity inside the store early in the film. While the soundtrack plays Dire Straits' 'Romeo and Juliet', the editor cuts between characters, coming back to 'Juliet' Mills' daughter each time the Juliet lyric is sung.Plus there is a nice bit of irony as the film opens with a customer asking a question which sets all the events in motion: 'Do you think the story is already written or do you think a bold courageous act can change the course of history?'. The irony being that the bold act changes the course of history in a totally unintended manner.The ending is a mix of the 'Times Square's' ending and something out of a Judy Garland- Mickey Rooney movie where they get the gang together and put on a show.'Empire Records' has no obvious technical problems and Moyle gets very even performances out of his relatively inexperienced cast. The soundtrack is the most diverse and extensive you are likely to encounter.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",10,0,0,6 February 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Wretched Excess Piled on Top of Wretched Excess
","John Huston once said that a good story should have 'excitement,color, spectacle and humor, adventure, high drama, tragedy, good conversation, truth and irony'. Unfortunately the discerning viewer won't find much of any of those qualities in 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. What they will find is a mildly entertaining spectacle of excess. There is enough tension to keep you watching, but when it finally ends and your mind recovers from its numbness, you will wish that you had not bothered.The ending is both familiar and predictable, at least to anyone over age six. Apparently predictability is comforting to the movie genre's core fan base, in much the same way as it is for a young child watching 'Beauty and the Beast' over and over again. They know the ending so the initial viewing does not scare them, and the repeated viewings give them a feeling of power and control as if they are determining the outcome each time they watch it.The authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.Finally John Huston would say that it doesn't hurt to have lovable hero's in your story. Lovable heroines wouldn't hurt either or at least ones that look sexy. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are attractive women but if they chose their own costumes (?) for this movie they are also airheads. Like many women they dress in what they think makes them look sexy. The result is a 6th Street hooker look that makes you laugh every time they appear in the frame. Check out Milla's 'Zoolander' look if you want to see what could have been; she actually looks sexier wearing old army fatigues in 'Dummy' than she does in her 'Resident Evil-Apocalypse' outfits.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",4,0,3,12 June 2005
Mulholland Drive," Reminds Me of Summer Camp
","A summer camp staple during my youth was a story our counselors used to tell at night around the campfire. It involved a guest at a country estate who was woken each night by a disturbance in the courtyard. He rushed to his window just in time to see a spectral presence running from the property and down the road. It took 20-30 minutes to tell the story as the counselor would meticulously detail all six times this occurred even though the particular events were identical. After six nights the guest devised a trap and caught the specter who turned out to be the owner of the estate. Just before dying the owner agreed to explain the how and why of his bizarre activity on the condition that the guest promise to never reveal the secret. The story ended with the explanation that the guest kept his promise and never told anybody the secret. This caused a lot of groaning around the campfire by the first year campers and laughter from those who had heard the story the year before. We felt cheated by the story but had to admire the brazen manner in which we had just been conned. David Lynch took our old campfire story idea and made it into a feature film called 'Mulholland Drive'. For the first 80% of the film he constructs an elaborate and intriguing storyline which has the audience trying to guess the ending, wondering how what he can possibly tie all these disparate elements together into a coherent conclusion. One thing leads to another--but nothing leads anywhere.In the end he cheats and the movie is incomplete because it was not intended to be complete. But like the campfire story we do not really feel cheated because Lynch is absolutely brazen about his cheating, he does not back away from it. Screen writing is a whole lot easier when closure is not a goal.So don't watch this if you require a director who plays fair. But if you like a surreal dream in a highly stylized Hollywood film noir package you should enjoy this thing. I gave it a seven because of the cheating and because of the masterpiece it could have been if Lynch had been able to pull it together in the final 20 minutes. But I bumped it up to an eight because he is so unapologetic about taking the easy way out. If nothing else the first 80% shows that Lynch could make a straight film as good as 'L.A. Confidential' if he wanted. And it's worth watching just for the audition scene where the singer performs 'Sixteen Reasons'. The scene begins with a tight shot, then backs out to a POV from inside the control booth, then backs out further and reveals the booth is a prop on a sound stage. So we have a live stage performance, that morphs into a recording session, and then morphs into a movie audition. And the movie itself is inside a movie. Are you confused yet? But this fits with the film because Lynch is telling the same story (trying to make it in Hollywood) with two different protagonists. The bubbly, optimistic Betty, with a support network and a good heart. And within Betty is the beat-up, worn-out Diane, who has abandoned all hope of success and become paranoid and vengeful.Perhaps more entertaining than the film itself are those posted comments that claim to have it all figured out. For example: 'once I got the basic meaning of the two segments, it all made sense. ALL OF IT. Every character, every scene, every prop had its purpose and it all made sense as a cohesive whole'. Who is dumber-the person who is totally clueless about the film or the person who wrote that comment?By the way Naomi Watts is so good in this thing that it is scary.",8,0,2,22 May 2005
Saw II," Nicely Done
","Anytime a low budget ($4 Million) horror film beats the box office pants off all the expensive stuff is cause for rejoicing, even when it is being pushed by a major distributor (Lion's Gate). It is hard to understand the negative reviews of 'Saw II'. Sure its target audience is the lamest segment of the teen market (the ones who rushed to see 'Dukes of Hazard' and avoided 'Serenity'), and braving the Halloween crowd at my local mega-plex required the self-infliction of a large dose of local drones and wigger girls snorting like pigs throughout the film. But this sequel is a much better movie than the original (insert 'Aliens' here). Although not on the level of the more subtle 'The Hole', it delivers a nice package of suspense and misdirection, plus a cute ending. And even tripling the original's budget did not make it so big that the good qualities of the original were lost to expensive effects and computer generated nonsense. The 'Saw' franchise is an idea born out of the need for low cost production design. They continue to make do with an industrial rest room and the interiors of an old house (or apartment complex) and warehouse. Which fortunately fit the atmosphere and texture that they want. Acting and action are secondary to this psychological thriller/horror film despite vast quantities of blood and gore (insert the snorting of wigger girls here). It is much better on the big screen than at home because the audio is extremely important to the whole effect.Three characters return from the original. This time Tobin Bell has a major role as a kind of low-key Hannibal Lexter (the franchise owes a lot to 'Silence of the Lambs') and Shawnee Smith reprises an expanded Amanda role. I was shocked that I actually recognized a slimmed down Beverly Mitchell in the cast, maybe not as shocked as I was at seeing a virtually unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg. The last I recall of him was 'Southie' (1998) and the seven years since have not been kind.To really enjoy 'Saw II' you have to be willing to cut it some slack in the credibility department, although not to quite the degree as was required by the original. Although several of the performances are poor (Dina Meyer-the third returnee and Frankie G especially) none are on the clinker level of Danny Glover's in the original. Likewise the plausibility factor never hits deeply into negative, there is no repeat of anything as inane as the original's family menacing scene.",8,2,4,31 October 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Some Comparisions to the Original
","This is a remake that cries out to be compared to the original. In part because there was no reason other than making money for even doing the remake; the original's story and the style are pretty much timeless. And in part because Tim Burton did not use the opportunity to do a different take on the original story; he pretty much stayed with the same tone and style. But the story itself is so interesting that even multiple remakes are welcome.The question then is whether this remake is worth watching for those who liked the original? The answer is an qualified 'yes'. If you have not seen the original and if you like fun fantasy films it is almost a sure thing. If you liked the original you should enjoy the remake but will probably feel that most of the charm of the original is missing. Here are a few comparisons:All the original songs have been replaced by more 'techno' stuff that is showcased by Oompa Loompas doing Busby Berkeley numbers. These are rather ordinary, but since Veruca's and Violet's original songs were the only ones really memorable the change is pretty much neutral. The exception to this is Burton's satire of Disney's 'It's A Small World Afterall' which greets the visitors in the courtyard of the chocolate factory. The hokey puppets which eventually short circuit and self-destruct is inspired and is clearly the best addition to the story.The remake works in spite of Johnny Depp who gives a game but generally uncomfortable portrayal. This is made worse by the timing of the release because it is hard to get past the Michael Jackson caricature; whether intentional or unintentional.Gene Wilder's Wonda was an omniscient and paternal character, whose weirdness was all affectation. Depp's Wonka is a deeply disturbed psychological mess, with lots of real issues. This allows for a number of flashback scenes into his rather nasty childhood. These are generally painful to watch and with each revelation you are thinking: 'I didn't need to know that' and 'I wish I hadn't seen that'. Whatever Depp and Burton may think they gain from this, they break the unity of the film and taint the story. In a lame attempt to pull this new stuff together, Burton tacks on a moronic ending which just makes you regret not leaving the theater after Mike becomes a microwave signal.Because the story does not crash and burn until the final few minutes, it works well as a remake and most should enjoy it on its own merits. For others it is worth watching just to try to figure out where the $150 Million budget went. Considering that the original's budget was $3 Million and its slightly off-kilter Victorian production design is significantly better than the look of the remake ('Wizard of Oz' meets 'Resident Evil') you have to truly applaud everyone associated with the original's set design.",8,0,2,7 August 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Favorite
","Normally I don't wait several years to comment on a recent film, simply because it is unlikely that many will read my comment. But the comments and reviews for 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' (2007) are generally so off-the-mark that a few supplemental comments could be of value. And hopefully my comments gain useful perspective from the distance of a few years since the release.As has already been said this chapter of the story is a relatively small-scale one. The Ministry of Magic is worried that Hogwarts presents a security risk, and so it plants a mole (Dolores Umbridge - slickly played by Imelda Staunton) to discredit Dumbledore and to prevent him from training students to defend themselves against the dark arts. The Ministry is in denial about the return of 'he who must not be named' (i.e. Lord Voldemort is back and preparing for an attack).Personally 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is my favorite of all the films up to now. I have a lot of reasons. For one, while the three principle actors by 2007 had begun to look a bit too old for their characters (Rupert Grint especially so), the disparity is not so great that a lot of energy must be expended suspending disbelief; as is the case with the later films. And Daniel Radcliffe uses his maturity as a actor to bring a sophisticated internal life to Harry; something he could not quite manage in the earlier films. Another reason is that it represents the midway point of the overall story and therefore strikes the best balance between serious elements and elements of whimsy. And things stay fresh with the introduction of new characters like Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helen Bonham Carter) who fit the film's dark/light balance by being evil characters who are amusingly overplayed.But I suspect that the biggest reason I favor this particular film is that it does not flinch from the book's theme of existential despair. And they economically pull this off through the inspired casting of Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, my all-time favorite Potter character. Harry suffers a lot inside, which is one of the things that makes him different from the other students at Hogwarts, most of whom tend to avoid him. And he in turn tends to isolate himself, even from his close friends Ron and Hermione. The film version of Luna is the only friend who really gets Harry and he is energized by their interactions. 'The things we lose have a way of coming back to us, even if it is not always in a way that we expect'.Rowling and others have pointed out that Luna is Hermione's alter ego; an illogical and impulsive counterpart to Hermione's analytical realist. Both process more information than their fellow students, but Hermione has filters to define and dispense with the information. Luna is less judgmental, for her processing is experiencing.While these comparisons help define Herminone, Luna herself is important because of her similarity to Harry. The subtle similarities regularly amaze him and they allow her to repeatedly demonstrate to him that he is not alone. She is his bridge to everyone else in a story where he must subordinate his desire to go it alone if he hopes to successfully engage the forces of the Dark Lord. The film was especially focused on illustrating this special quality of their relationship.Overall, what has most amazed me about the whole Harry Potter series is the evidence that Rowling had the entire story pretty much outlined in detail at the beginning and engaged in considerable foreshadowing; something you do not appreciate with the first reading of each book. The 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' adaptation provides an interesting example of how this foreshadowing can be done visually. Ginny Weasley is destined to become Harry's love interest but up until this point it has been mostly a little sister / big brother type relationship (Bonnie Wright was only 10 when featured in 'Chamber of Secrets'). In 'Order of the Phoenix' Harry is still preoccupied with Cho Chang (Katie Leung who looks considerably older than Wright). What to watch for are the scenes in which the Harry - Cho relationship progresses; each time the editor goes out on a static shot of a grim Ginny observing their interaction.The two-disc special edition DVD does not include an extended version of the film. Instead the second disc includes a number of special features. 'Trailing Tonks', a tour of the film sets hosted by offbeat Natalia Tena is especially good. There are also a number of humorous deleted scenes of Emma Thompson portraying Professor Trelawney, scenes that do not fit the tone of the film but are amusing on their own.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",9,0,1,29 May 2011
"Girl, Interrupted"," She's a Girl on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown
","If you are a prospective viewer or buyer of 'Girl, Interrupted', don't be mislead by the many comparisons to 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', other than the setting in a mental hospital there is little similarity. There is little similarity between the two hospitals and no reason to believe that the 'movie' adaptation of Kesey's book influenced 'Susanna Kaysen's' autobiographical story. If you are looking for a film to predict your reaction a much better choice would be 'Ordinary People'. It is fairly safe to say that if you enjoyed that film you will be entertained by 'Girl, Interrupted'. Although the film was inspired by Kaysen's actual experiences and is told from her point of view (her character is played by Winona Ryder), it is really more allegorical than real; with general themes about freedom, individualism, conformity, and expectations. Unlike 'Cuckoo's Nest' the villain is not the system but our own internal demons; 'we have met the enemy and he is us'. This is an ensemble piece and in trying to be character inclusive the film must sacrifice a lot of character depth and development. A really good director would grasp this problem and invent ways to compensate; fleshing out characters with visual behaviors and filling the frame with faces and eyes, including extensive reaction shots. Unfortunately, director James Mangold is pretty much clueless and the absence of tight shots and subtle characterization distances the viewer from the characters and makes it hard to identify or connect. Still the story is compelling enough to engage most viewers and there are enough stereotypes to just fill in the blanks yourself about several characters. For example, the Julie (Angela Bettis) character, a thin ballerina with an eating disorder, needs little supplemental background information and Angela can just get on with things that move along the storyline. Kaysen's take on herself and her fellow patients is interesting. Everyone sees little purple men, but you only get locked up for it if you complain about it (insert not conforming here). Then like Dorothy in Oz you can always go home by pronouncing yourself willing to conform, since there was never anything wrong (at least relative to everyone else) in the first place. Diagnosed with a Borderline Personality Disorder, Kaysen's real danger is becoming too comfortable in the sheltered environment of the institution to want to go home. Her thoughts of suicide seem rather silly to her after she is actually confronted with death.A borderline personality is appropriate for the theme of the story because apparently the psychological community is still uncertain about whether such a classification is even valid. The vague description is of a person born with a tendency to react more intensely to lower levels of stress than others and to take longer to recover; peaking emotionally on less provocation and taking longer coming down (which probably describes almost everyone that you know). The patients in her ward are messed up in a variety of ways, if the girls in my high school had been this interesting I probably would have married one. Most have found a home in the institution and have little desire to leave. One (Lisa-Angelina Jolie) is manipulatively dangerous with no conscience. She periodically escapes but always returns to sadistically pick on and push the buttons of her captive audience inside. Another (Brittney Murphy) is truly a psychological basket case, of course she is the first one to be released. Winona does a good job with this role but it does not offer her that much, as the nature of the story requires that Susanna be played in a very constrained way. She is a little too old for the role and her style of playing her characters realistically hurts your perception of her acting when everyone else is carrying on in a expressionistic overplay. Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg (she plays a perceptive RN) really shine. I'm puzzled by the amount of praise Jolie's performance has received. She is fine in the role but there is nothing difficult here, mostly she just plays herself and occasionally looks like she would enjoy pulling the wings off a few flies. Bettis and Murphy could have handled the role just as well while Jolie would have struggled with their parts. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8,3,4,27 May 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Why I Think Jane Would Have Approved
","It is my sincere wish that Jane Austen readers and non-readers not miss a big screen viewing of Joe Wright's 'Pride & Prejudice' because they let themselves be influenced by negative comments from the Ellen Jamesian sect of the Jane Austen society. Particularly odious are those presumptuous enough to declare that Austen herself would consider the film a disservice. Attempting to discourage potential viewers in this manner reveals not just a staggering conceit, but an utter cluelessness about how to read a film and about the power of a visual medium.This film adaptation of Austen's classic is the first one to fully capture its essence within the economical and efficient package of a two-hour feature film. And it does so in a technically proficient way (cinematography-production design-editing); with perfect physical casting, excellent directing and scene staging, and fine performances from the entire ensemble. In isolation it is simply the best film ever made, but because it is not an original screenplay the critics have downgraded it a bit from A plus to A minus (their acknowledgment of the debt it owns to Austen).Jane Austen once said, 'an artist cannot do anything slovenly'. Joe Wright's film is not perfect but it is the least slovenly in cinema history. I was reminded of this by the film's treatment of Georgiana, Darcy's sister. Georgiana was a minor but extremely important character in the book. Elizabeth's point of view observations of Darcy's tender treatment of his shy little sister is how Austen shows Elizabeth's first realization that Darcy is worthy of her love. Initially I was disappointed that Georgiana only has two brief appearances in the film, but on reflection I realized that the scenes had been staged and scripted so well that they said everything needed about the relationship dynamics of the three characters.The film successfully brings Austen's ironic (insert comic here) observations of character and manners to the screen. As the title proclaims, this story has a double theme, the pride of the aristocrat prejudicing the middle class heroine against him. But as Elizabeth explains to her father in my favorite scene, she and Darcy are the flip sides of each other as her pride has long blinded her to Darcy's efforts to overcome the prejudice of his class to hers.The film also captures the more critical macro element of Austen's novel, the idea of a generous humanness that can transcend the motivations of social class. Society is imperfect and while the social order encourages foolish prides and mean prejudices, it also enables kindness, affection, and courage. In the film's movement of events there is a modulation between vices and virtues in which the latter more than mitigates the former. This was Jane Austen's primary 'value' and what I think would have formed the basis of her judgment and ultimate approval of the film.Then again, what do I know?

Alice in Wonderland," Curtsey While You're Thinking What to Say - It Saves Time
","As an 'Alice' purist I generally cringe at the assortment of attempts to adapt either of Lewis Carroll's works 'Alice in Wonderland' and/or 'Through the Looking Glass' to the movie screen. These have been of varying quality but even the best are no more than satisfactory ('Dreamchild' being an exception but it was more about the real Alice than about the Wonderland Alice).But I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into before shelling out the bucks to see this Burton effort in 3-D. I knew that despite what many have said and despite its title, this is not an adaptation of Carroll's books. Accordingly I knew that this would greatly increase my toleration level. They could do what they liked with the traditional characters and play around with whatever sort of plot elements intrigued them; I would not take particular offense.That said I had no real problem with anything about the film. In Burton and writer Linda Woolverton's story, Alice revisits Wonderland/The Looking Glass House 13 years after waking up from her original dreams. Alice, now almost 20, is attending her sister's garden party, which she discovers is intended to be her engagement party. Cringing at a marriage proposal from the unappealing son of her father's former business partner, she runs from the party and follows a white rabbit down an immense hole.Her seemingly endless fall is arguably the best scene of the film and is by far the best Hollywood has ever assembled; even including a slick twist at the bottom where her hair is standing on end. Then she repeats the drink-me eat-me shrinking-growing bit from the book. And these two sequences are pretty much the only thing other than the characters that come directly out of the book. One advantage of having a 20-year-old Alice is that her clothes do not shrink or grow with her size changes. She must improvise on each occasion and this adds a touch of physical comedy to the transformations.For her part Alice seems to have suppressed the memory of her two childhood dreams, showing little familiarity with the characters she is meeting for a second time (in some cases a third time). And initially they are unsure that she is the same Alice who visited them over a decade earlier. But for the white rabbit, the dormouse, the Tweedles, and the smoking caterpillar she has be the right Alice because they have lured her back to fulfill a prophecy. It has been foretold that Alice will slay the Jabberwocky (a dragon worthy of the lizards in the old 50's sci-fi films) with a magical sword. This will change the balance of power, with the good White Queen getting the crown from the wicked Red Queen. We've seen this thing before, insert: 'Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings' here. And they throw in a few visuals from 'The Neverending Story' series.Ultimately Alice goes all 'Joan of Arc' or at least 'Jane and the Dragon' and becomes a knight in armor. Many have lamented this action adventure turn of the story but the actual showdown takes only about 10 minutes so I don't think it is that big of a deal. And it has some considerable basis as Alice had been the White Queen's Pawn (because the Queen's daughter Lily was too young to play) throughout the chess match in 'Through the Looking Glass'. That story was just one big chess game with a lengthy combat segment between the White Knight and the Red Knight, as well as a fight between the 'Gladstone' Lion and the 'Disraeli' Unicorn for the crown. The only problem I see is that the combat is all too predictable.Burton's film has many delightful moments; I liked it better than almost any of the recently released big budget stuff although it's not in the same league as 'Pride and Prejudice' or 'Atonement'.Mia Waisikowska strikes a perfect balance as the title character, playing the bravest heroine in literary history requires a lot of nonverbal stuff and she sells her reluctance nicely along with giving her character a subtle sensual dimension.Helena Bonham Carter pretty much steals the film, although she is upstaged on occasion by the grinning Cheshire cat. Depp's Mad Hatter never quite comes into focus, playing the character as a schizophrenic (at least that's what I assume he was doing) introduced a little too much pain into this type of story; in much the same way that his take on Willy Wonka just brought the viewer down. A run-of-the-mill lunatic would worked better.As the White Queen, Anne Hathaway was pretty much irrelevant and was most likely cast because of her 'small' head (her features seem to take up her entire face-especially with the extreme make-up), a kind of good-guy bad-guy balance for her evil sister's big head. But I did like the off-kilter Morticia Addams take she gave her character; rather than playing her as a goody-two-shoes.The audience during my showing was attentive and entertained from beginning to end (well almost to the end as the film goes out on a couple of extremely weak scenes back on the surface). But most bolted before the closing credits, which played over Avril Lavigne singing 'Alice' (Avril also appears in the film's trailer). Given that it is mostly up-scale theaters with state-of-the-art sound systems showing this film, those who left missed one of the best moments of the whole viewing experience. Not unlike those who missed the great closing credits animation sequences at the end of 'A Series of Unfortunate Events'.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Null,1,1,31 March 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A Joyless and Mind-Numbing Five Hours
","It sure seemed like five hours, I was checking my watch every five minutes; about the same as for 'King Arthur' and 'Electra', but a little less than 'Catwoman'. It tries to blend the domestic-secret agent concept from 'True Lies' but has none of the charm of that movie. It rips off 'The Big Hit' for most of its action sequences and for what passes as comedy. But the big hit looks much better, only cost $13 Million, and gives viewers two much sexier actresses, China Chow and Christina Applegate (and a better looking hero-Mark Wahlberg). I truly cannot imagine anyone with even an average level of intelligence or sophistication enjoying this thing. It is just one pointless bit of excess after another. Don't worry about the plot because the writer, director, and editor apparently did not bother to include one. And it's not really an action picture even though there is one mind-numbing CG enhanced action sequence after another.What saves this from a complete suck-fest is that Pitt and Jolie seem to be having fun together on the screen. But now I understand Jolie's latest comments about giving up her acting career, there can't be much professional satisfaction making crap like this so unless you need the money why bother. I will miss being amused thinking about how much her face resembles what Jessica Alba would see if she looked at herself in a warped fun house mirror.The 100 million dollar cost of this movie was only 35 million less than Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds'. While very little of this budget found its way onto the screen, the movie is having no trouble generating enough box office to cover the cost. So my finding it incomprehensible that anyone would find it entertaining is pretty much irrelevant. ECON 101 tells us that people would not shell out money to see this if they did not derive considerable utility from the viewing (maybe even multiple viewings). As long as some of this type of stuff makes money, Hollywood will churn it out. And as American citizens this is really more about embarrassment than anything else since we are not being forced to watch it. Whether you blame our education process, our gene pool, or just our culture; the fact is that pretty much the whole rest of the world feels a collective superiority every time we crank out something this moronic and devour it like a bunch of rubes who just saw their first moving picture.So you can understand the laments that Hollywood big movies are killing intelligent cinema. But if it is any consolation I just caught the ending of the original 1976 version of 'Freaky Friday', which featured car chase and water ski sequences almost as moronic the action sequences in 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith'. This in spite of a cast that included Jodie Foster, John Astin, and Barbara Harris (fresh off her fantastic performance in 'Nashville'). In the almost 30 years since, the industry has managed to crank out an impressive number of so-called blockbusters that were actually pretty good, and the independent film movement has hung in there and produced some truly fantastic films. So maybe things are not as bleak as they seem while suffering through 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith'.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",3,1,3,24 June 2005
30 Days of Night," Losing Their Heads
","As you have probably guessed, '30 Days of Night' is a vampire movie - which means it has elements of both terror and self-parody. It is very likely the year's best horror movie, coming from 'Hard Candy' director David Slade. Nasty vampires methodically assault an isolated Alaskan town and theatre viewers rarely will find a moment to relax. Much like 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Phantoms' there is a rapidly diminishing chance of survival in this world of perpetual darkness. Although vampire conventions are followed, Dracula-type wooden stakes and silver bullets are conspicuously absent. The film's gory visuals are not for the squeamish which is exactly what vampire movie buffs and fans of the original graphic novels will get off on. '30 Days of Night' captures the coolest parts of Steve Niles' graphic novel series on the big screen. Like the books it is filled with buckets of gore but manages to include a certain intelligence that fans of '28 Days Later' and John Carpenter's better movies are searching for but can rarely find. While some horror genre purists will be turned off by all the talking, there is very little actual character development and enough action and suspense for most everyone. There is even a geography lesson as we learn that Barrow, Alaska is the northernmost city in America, and even more isolated and alien during its annual 30 days of continuous darkness. During this period the vampires (who apparently have just discovered this vampire paradise) suck the blood of most everyone in the town. The exception being a small group led by Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his ex-wife Stella (Melissa George), who must wait out the horrifying 30 days of night. The pairing of Hartnett (who has no discernible acting skills) with George (who is quite talented) could have been a disaster, fortunately neither part is particularly challenging so the skill disparity is not too obvious. And who watches these things for the acting anyway. Also fortunate is the casting of Danny Huston as the vampire leader, he sells his character (i.e. monster). Much like 'Day of the Dead' and 'Jumanji' the band of survivors do things to which the average viewer can relate. They raid a supermarket and hide in an attic. It's best to stay vague with even the setup for this movie because it takes so many turns, at first seeming to be one kind of horror film before events move the characters in other directions. The surviving neighbors fight back with some degree of success. Watch for the town outcast who uses 'bulldozers for bazookas', in the style of Sigourney Weaver operating that forklift robot thing in 'Aliens'. . Screenwriters Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson craft characters that don't make stupid decisions and a plot that doesn't turn on unrealistic coincidences. Those who didn't read the graphic novels might find some of the intricate plot turns a bit too cerebral for a mindless night out at the movies and detailed explanations are hard to find. But at least the filmmakers aren't trying to insult your intelligence. It is nice to find a vampire film that is uncompromising in its violence and yet extremely subtle about its moments of self-parody (insert the Hartnell acting for a few laugh-out-loud moments late in the film). It's even nicer to find some effort put into realistic action sequences, not the fake fast cut nonsense that lesser directors use to mask their inability to shoot action scenes. Adding to the terror is having the vampires converse in a demonic language of their own (subtitles are thankfully provided). The vampires move at lightning speed but have little going for themselves in style or culture (there is no 'Underworld' sophistication here). There are be-headings, animal violence, the slaughter of children, and a 'Gremlins' inspired use of a snow plow. Get it on guys. Overall the film is well made, nicely filmed, and competently acted (even with the sometimes painful Hartnett factor). Obviously this sort of thing is not everyone's cup of tea but is great Halloween fare for those who get off on this kind of stuff. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",7,4,8,24 October 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Extremely Funny
","Vampire films almost by definition are parodies, just as the Victorian-era vampire story is almost by definition a metaphor for repressed sexuality. These run from the obvious ('Fearless Vampire Killers'), to the subtle ('Van Helsing'), to the self-parody ('Bram Stoker's Dracula').Coppola's 'Dracula' is a lush high budget adaptation that bears only a slight resemblance to the Bram Stoker original story. That it takes a major liberty by adding bad history to make the title character sympathetic is forgivable, in part because it adds to the self-parody element and in part because this version still incorporates the enough elements of the original-if somewhat reinterpreted to better align with the sympathetic treatment.The parody elements begin early when Dracula declares war on God by pushing his sword into a stone cross which then begins to flood the room with blood (yes it is as silly as it sounds). At one point Coppola breaks the conventions of the genre and allows Dracula to walk around in daylight. Dracula's getup for this scene may have been the inspiration for Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka look. The warders in the insane asylum spend their on camera time spraying the patients with fire hoses, and they wear birdcages on their heads while performing this duty. Throughout the film, Coppola and his post-production people parody the overuse of 'match cut' transitions (i.e. when a light in the current scene cross-dissolves into a fire in the next scene) by other filmmakers. They make almost all transitions into overreaching match cuts. This is all enormous fun to watch but not as much fun as the wild performances by the cast.Gary Oldman, Sadie Frost, Richard E. Grant, Tom Waits, and Anthony Hopkins all overplay their characters in a nice self-parodying way. They obviously are having a whole lot of fun playing this stuff for laughs. At one point Oldman gets to wear a makeup design that would work well in a Star Trek episode. But Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder act like Coppola forgot to let them in on the joke (unless everyone in the cast is happy because they are laughing at Reeves' lame attempt at a British accent). Reeves is too limited in the talent department to pull out an over-the-top self-parodying performance. Ryder's situation is a little different, her style and strength is playing all her roles as if they are real. Although this works nicely for things like her Veronica character in 'Heathers', it leaves her at the mercy of the script. Here the Mina character just doesn't have enough complexity to justify Winona's efforts.Speaking of Winona, she has never looked more desirable than in this film and the same can be said for Sadie Frost. This is ample justification for male viewers to seek out this film. Ryder and Frost even manage a brief passionate kiss during a cloudburst.There is one wondrously nice sequence where the editor cuts back and forth between Lucy's last encounter with Dracula and Nina's wedding ceremony. It is really a slick bit of film magic and a nice illustration of the sexual nature of the whole vampire genre.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",7,0,0,10 December 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Very Slick
","'Stranger Than Fiction' (2006) fits into the tiny sub-genre of recent 'the tax-man needs love too' films, which includes 'Exotica' (1994) and 'Off the Map' (2003). And since nothing of real consequence happens in this moral tale of a film, you could make a case for it being like Eric Rohmer's 'My Night With Maude' (insert sequences of serio-comic triviality here). Although I can see why some people compare it to 'The Hours' (2002) it is really a variation on 'Adaptation' (2002) and its various allegorical elements. As in 'Adaptation' you have a stalled character going to a literary professional for advice. Instead of troubled screenwriter Charlie Kaufman seeking advice from adaptation guru Robert McKee, you have IRS agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) contacting literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Which serves as an excuse to utilize a vast store of insider jokes about screen writing/fiction writing. Maggie Gyllenhaal was in both films. In 'Stranger Than Fiction' she plays Harold love interest, Ana Pascal, the irreverent owner of a bakery. This is one of the all-time best film romances and it owes a lot Director Marc Forster's casting of these two actors. It's a quirky and sideways path to romance and is sold by Ferrell's trademark lack of guile and Gyllenhaal's way of teasing a role. As in 'Adaptation' the wrapped too tight hero might be schizophrenic; but instead of a fast living unpretentious twin brother, Harold hears a woman author's narration in his head; and she is narrating a highly accurate account of Harold's day-to-day existence. The voice is actually that of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a slightly suicidal author struggling with writer's block. Her prior books have all ended with the death of her main character (insert 'The Hours' here) and she is struggling with just how to dispatch Harold in the book she is currently writing. Harold is clued to his ultimate fate when her narration uses the phrase 'little did he know'. Both Ana and Jules nicely display the dichotomy between the passion of their creativity and the reserve of their analysis and critique. Once he knows his fate Harold begins making positive changes in his life style, which culminates in his romance with Ana. So you get the standard 'stop and smell the roses' theme, a bit of a 'free will vs destiny' theme, and finally the principal question: If the novel Kay is writing would be a masterpiece only if it ends in Harold's death, what right does he have continue his life? And the secondary question once Kay understands the implications of a tragic ending: Can she assume the responsibility of sacrificing another life as the necessary cost of producing a masterpiece? The production design in 'Stranger Than Fiction' is nothing to get excited about but it does not distract from the story. There is some distraction by the effects people who periodically overlay cute little graphics to illustrate Harold compulsive need to count things and set things in order. But it is all in the service of character development. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",9,0,0,22 December 2007
Casino Royale," Nice Change of Pace for the Series
","It is appropriate that 'Casino Royale', the first of the James Bond books (1953), would also be the first James Bond film to get a makeover. The original 1967 film was not just the black sheep of the series, but a bizarre departure from pretty much everything the franchise stood for. Which made it the best candidate for a remake which itself drastically breaks away from many Bond film conventions. The new 'Casino Royale' represents a welcome invigoration of a series at a crossroads where it either had to reinvent itself or retire. As the least elaborate and most basic of Ian Fleming's series, the story adapts well to a gritty no-nonsense treatment. Basically it is the origin story of 007 and Daniel Craig, doing a reprise of his performance in 'Layer Cake', steps in as the new (and the most like Fleming's original) Bond. He is more out-of-control dashing than suave and sophisticated. While the young James Bond immature and overconfident, he comes by these traits honestly being both a competent and a maladjusted young man. Which means a mean streak and a soft side unlike any Bond before him. Unlike the sound stage sets of the original 'Casino Royale', the remake makes extensive use of exotic location shooting. The events in the films and the book center around a high stakes game (Texas hold-em poker here-baccarat in the others) as the villain Le Chiffre attempts to add funds to his agency's treasury at the gaming tables (the present day setting of the film requires the insertion of terrorist connections). For longtime fans of the franchise, Casino Royale offers some retro kicks. The film nicely blends virtuoso action sequences with sexy romance; and throws in a torture sequence more in the tradition of 'The Ipcress Files' than 'Goldfinger. This is serious stuff, not the self-parody and cartoonish antics which had begun to dominate the productions even before the Brosnan era. At first the new direction might seem a considerable gamble, but while there was no guarantee of success the producers had little to lose except production costs because the franchise was so close to fading away. Something rugged and unconventional was needed and that is exactly what the new 'Casino Royale' delivers. The gritty opening scenes (featuring desaturated images) flashback to Bond as he is earning his 007 designation with brutal assassinations in a public bathroom and office. No silly gadgets (at least not really silly) or 'Man From UNCLE' quips. There is a gray Aston Martin and the best car chase in Bond film history. The new Le Chiffre is no Orsen Welles; and must rely on a bleeding non-functional eye for his creepiness. The interplay between Bond and Vesper Lynds (Eva Green) works quite well. The writing team of Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis provide a particularly nice script and it is fair to say that this version of 'Casino Royale' ranks up there with the best of the series. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8,1,3,15 December 2006
Saving Mr. Banks," 'Sorry Daddy'
","'I dropped the pears ... sorry daddy' says the stunned child who will grow up to become the creator of Mary Poppins. The child (wonderfully underplayed by Annie Rose Buckley) has returned from the pear fetching errand to find that her long-suffering father has passed away from influenza during her brief absence. Thus begins a life of atonement for P.L. Travers, who will take her father's first name as her surname and adopt a rather strait-laced no-nonsense existence. The whimsical person she was to have become is instead incorporated into her creation, a character modeled on the physical characteristics of her Aunt Ellie (played by Rachel Griffiths) and the style of J. M. Barrie - who she admired. The film confirms this in the closing credits with two different drawings of Mary Poppins, the first one appears when Buckley is credited and the second one a little later when Griffiths is credited.Buckley's is the key performance of the production as she must non-verbally sell the child's absolute and unqualified adoration of her father, if the parallel story of Travers' efforts at atonement for not saving him are to ring true. In this the young Australian actress is absolutely convincing and John Lee Hancock demonstrates his considerable acting-for-the-camera directing skills.The film is an extremely well-crafted tale with two parallel time-lines, Travers' traumatic coming-of-age story and Walt Disney's ultimately successful efforts to secure the rights to bring Mary Poppins to the big screen. Both proceed chronologically, with Travers recalling her childhood in sequenced flashbacks. More subtle is a third story, minimalist references to Disney's own childhood, which serve as a compare and contrast with Travers; with portions of both fathers blending into the 1964 film's version of Mr. Banks (played by David Tomlinson who appears at the center of that film's cast photo in the closing credits) . The film teasingly alludes to a similarity between these two creative people. Both brought a lot of childhood baggage with them into adulthood in the way of father issues. And for both these issues are reflected in the dichotomy of their adult lives. Early in the film they cut-away to the second floor window of Elias Disney's office on Disneyland's Main Street, Walt's tribute to the work ethic instilled in him by his father. Later Disney attributes the motivation behind his retreat into imagination to bitterness about a childhood which was anything but whimsical.Those behind 'Saving Mr. Banks' understood what it is like to still be wrestling with childhood demons throughout adulthood and they knew how to make the viewer feel the struggle.On the other hand the saving of Mr. Banks premise is a non-factor in the Mary Poppins books (the original and the sequels). The film would be more accurately named 'Saving Mr. (Elias) Disney'. Apparently Travers was appalled before, during, and after the screening of the dumbed down film adaptation of her books. And by all accounts she carried her litany of objections to her grave, never permitting a sequel. For 50 years avid readers have been mystified by the adaptation's unrecognizable theme and its peculiar areas of emphasis. The adaptation did not include Travers' best chapter (Mary Popping's birthday party at the zoo among the animals) nor her best character (the star Maia from the Pleiades cluster of the Taurus constellation - who Jane and Michael help in her human form to pick out Christmas gifts for her six sisters). Instead they fabricated additional scenes for the horribly miscast Dick Van Dyke - whose casting even 'Saving Mr. Banks' acknowledges as being entirely for commercial purposes.Then again, what do I know?

Lucy," 'Hit Girl' meets 'The Incredible Shrinking Man'
","'We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale' says Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) by way of summation of the insights she has achieved under an accidental overdose of a new and powerful synthetic drug.This is to date Johansson's best performance, full of tight close-ups on her face as her character nonverbally radiates a dimensionality seldom seen on the screen. I suspect that Evan Rachel Wood's Dolores Abernathy character in 'Westword' was influenced by Johansson's take on her title character. Both characters drift seamlessly in and out of a distanced robotic mindset. Especially remarkable is Lucy's overseas phone call to her mother.'Lucy' is a philosophical film being marketed as science fiction - action adventure. Since it worked for '2001: A Space Odyssey' back in 1968 I guess they thought it would work here. But the mismatch has caused 'Lucy' to miss much of Luc Besson's intended audience and to disappoint those looking for Scarlett doing a 'Leon' inspired 'Kick-Ass' number in tight shiny 'Black Widow' latex.The mismatch between the film and its promotional campaign is my only major criticism. A minor criticism is the poor quality of the digital effects (the car chase doesn't hold a candle to the old fashion way, insert 1998's 'Ronin' here). Given the budget limitations, the POV, and the transforming mental condition of the title character; the film would have been far better served had Beeson substituted expressionism for realism. Cinema greatness was there for the taking.As in 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' and '2001: A Space Odyssey' the existential theme is not anti-God (or even pro Übermensch), but anti-ego. With a character slowly losing their connection with humanity, finally connecting with the infinite at the moment they become infinitesimal.'Man's task in life is the paradoxical one of realizing his individuality and at the same time transcending it to arrive at the experience of universality. Only the fully developed self can drop the ego.'

The Sixth Sense," A Classic
","'The Sixth Sense' (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion. But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying. The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering 'not anymore', after he has helped Krya. And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): 'Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too.'The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.Then again, what do I know?

Click," Apparently Some People Liked It
","They keep letting this guy (Adam Sandler) make movies; most likely because audiences flock to see most of his stuff, as was the case with 'Click' (2006). I'm not going to go into a rant about the sophistication level of those who patronize their local multi-plexus. Suffice it to say that 'Click' is as good as at least half the big-budget ($70 Million) stuff that is being released to the mainstream public. It raked in some serious cash last July.Apparently Sadler has a thing for Frank Capra, as this is his second attempt to remake a Capra classic (insert 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town'). 'Click' is Sandler's take on 'It's a Wonderful Life' (1946). At least I assume the Jimmy Stewart classic was what they were aiming at because the end result seems more of a blend of 'Scrooged' and 'Being There'. 'Click' is probably Sandler's all-time best performance; in the style of and equal in quality to a good Tim Allen performance. He is assisted by a supporting cast of recognizable actors; Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, and Sean Astin. There is also a brief appearance by Jack Nicholson's daughter Lorraine, who looks amazingly like Jack back in his 'Easy Rider' days; this is actually kind of scary.Kate Beckinsale has the same role that Winona Ryder had in Mr. Deeds. While neither of them rank up there with Jean Arthur (the heroine in both Capra classics) they are still two of the best actresses out there today. I'm assuming both were very well paid because the scripts offer little opportunity for either to showcase their considerable acting skills. In fact the mismatch between talent and opportunity produces a strange discordance in both films. This might be one of those cases where a less talented performer would have been a better fit. George Bailey (and Scrooge) had an attitude adjustment after being granted visions of the past and the future by his guardian angel. Michael Newman's (Sandler) angel (Walken), who works in the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, gives him a television remote control that he can click whenever he wants to fast-forward his life past the parts that are annoying distractions to his workaholic aspirations. At first this seems like a wonderful device as he can dispense with the family interactions that complicate his life. But Michael soon discovers that the device programs itself and shifts him further and further into the future. The remote can also freeze a scene, mute the sound, and select past scenes from his life; but the film mostly concentrates on its fast-forwarding function.'Click' is technically a comedy and apparently some find a lot to laugh about. There are some funny moments early in the production but I found the humor to be in short supply for most of the story; relying on humping dogs for its only running gag. Ultimately 'Click' has a 'Groundhog Day' sort of theme. That in tuning out much of what life has to offer we miss life itself. Since this cold detached way of living is what most of us do (at least to some degree) it tends to undermine any comic quality the film might have. Of course unless your taste in comedy runs to Sandler's usual focus on bodily functions it doesn't take much to do this anyway. Inexplicably, even at his most detached, patient and accepting people surround Michael. His wife (Beckinsale), his parents (Winkler and Kavner), and his children continue to love him despite the absence of any lovable qualities. Similar to those who love this film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5,1,3,1 May 2007
Donnie Darko," 'It's A Wonderful Life' All Over Again
","I have never been a huge fan of 'Donnie Darko' as a science fiction story, which is how it was intended by writer/director Richard Kelly. The vague storytelling masks the gaps in logic and the budgetary constraints that did not allow them to show things more convincingly (also Kelly needed more experience before he tackled a project of this scope). However, fans have embraced this failing as the film's strength and have used the open-ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.By now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end. Donnie has been selected by some undisclosed guardian to bring the tangent and primary universes back into alignment. He is given some superhuman powers for this task but only a few clues about what must be done. Searching for answers (mostly about time travel) during the day and performing sleepwalking pranks by night (an inefficient way to bring about certain vaguely tangential events), he semi-cluelessly moves forward toward the deadline. At last he figures out that he must send an 'artifact' (a jet engine) back from the tangent universe to the normal universe. He seemingly knows that doing so will result in his death in the normal universe but he selflessly performs the task and restores things to a stable balance.This is not as silly and contrived as it sounds but it does have some major issues that must be ignored if one is to really embrace the film. It also lacks useful philosophical depth and is just a teen movie with some intriguing thoughts about time travel.But 'Donnie Darko' becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny. It is basically a twisted remake of Frank Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life', with Donnie a 1988 version of George Bailey and Frank his guardian angel. Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events. For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.To go with this unintended interpretation you just dismiss the whole thing about tangent universes. Instead Donnie dies at the beginning of the story by a random event (a jet engine falls off a plane passing over his house)over which he has no control. Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures. But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation. Ultimately he makes his first 'free choice' and elects his original death.'Heathers' was a major influence on Kelly and 'Donnie Darko' has that same sedated tone, with characters generally under-reacting to absurdly extreme developments. As in that film parents are not the problem, rather it is kids being incredibly (but believably) cruel to each other.The cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister. Unfortunately both Maggie and Jena Malone are wasted in unchallenging roles with minimal screen time.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8,8,14,21 December 2005
Dodgeball," Oddly Uneven
","Dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldn't find his car.'Dodgeball is a sport of violence, exclusion, and degradation'. I can personally relate to this movie. Growing up in the midwest we were forced to play it often, as early as age six. Hopefully its involuntary school version is just a Midwestern thing (Ohio, Michigan, Illinois) because it is truly a sport of 'violence, exclusion, and degradation'; which I can now look back on and laugh about (at least a little).I think Stiller got the concept from his Michigan friends who made it a great sequence in the 'Freaks and Geeks' pilot episode.But it would be hard to come up with another movie that is as uneven (hit and miss) in its humor.Pretty much everything involving Patches works extremely well; and works for both the Hank Azaria and the Rip Torn versions of the character. In fact these are some of the greatest comedy and dialogue bits ever. 'No, but I do it anyway because it's sterile and I like the taste'.There are also a lot of funny animations and graphics, some great stuff that comes totally out-of-the-blue; like 'thank you Chuck Norris' said with sincerity and the Lance Armstrong bit at the casino bar.The good stuff is almost entirely at the middle of the film. There is absolutely nothing in the first 20 minutes of interest but stay with it because it gets better. Likewise the last 20 minutes is a letdown although the tournament announcers/commentators (Jason Bateman and Gary Cole) do a pretty good parody of too slick sports broadcasting. And it was a nice touch to have David Hasselhoff as the abusive German coach.They reach for some cheap lesbian laughs which culminates with the tired draw of girls kissing.Vince Vaughn is likable and relaxed but it would be a stretch to call his stuff 'acting'.Ben Stiller is the main source of the misses. His 70's fitness freak never really works and the more you see the less funny it gets. Only the scenes with his 'real-life wife' Christine Taylor are worth watching. Stiller just doesn't have the talent for exaggerated humor and the writer gave all the good lines to the other characters.The supporting cast that I have not yet mentioned are lame and unimaginative. Since it is a comedy I assume that 'Steve the Pirate' is supposed to be funny but you can't tell that by how he looks or what he says. Julie Gonzalo plays her same cheerleader character from 'A Cinderella Story'; since the films were produced at the same time she may have just walked back and forth between the sets without having to do a costume change.The big mystery is why the creative talent behind 'Dodgeball produced so much great stuff and then did nothing worthwhile with the rest of the movie.",5,2,5,10 April 2005
