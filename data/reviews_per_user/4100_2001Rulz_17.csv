Saturday Night Fever," Other Than the Soundtrack, There's Really Nothin' *That Great* About the Movie!
","I really wanted to rent this movie and watch it, partly because it looked interesting and partly because everyone kept saying how good it is. What luck! I finally find some time and rent the movie! As I sat watching it for the first few minutes, as the movie opened with John Travolta doing his little funky walk thingy to the paint store with the Bee Gees music in the background, it seemed like it was going to be a good movie. But, and please don't sue me after I say this--the rest of the movie was just pretty downhill from there.Yeah, sure, you could say 'What about all those great dance moves John Travolta did on the floor??' or 'Don't forget that romantic scene with Toni and Stephanie dancing in the studio!' or something like that. Well, I myself have never really been the romantic type, and some of the dance scenes were just....well...I just didn't like them. They either went on too long or were kina cheesy, ya know?? I have nothing against John Travolta--he's a very good actor and played his part well in this movie--but I wouldn't say that this was the best of his films. I mean, some parts were too confusing or too boring or too cheesy. I really don't get that part where Toni and his pals all go and get busted up at that Chinese restaurant, or whatever. Plus, what's this bridge deal got to do with anything? See how confused I already am?! :-)Another thing is that some parts of 'Saturday Night Fever' were just unenjoyable to watch. I wanted to watch the movie with a member of my family or someone, and, well, frankly, I'm *glad* I didn't. And does every other sentence really have to have the F word in it? It gets kind of old after a while, people.Well, I just want to say that I really don't like this movie at all, and think it hasn't really lived up to what everybody says about it. Like I said, I have nothing against John Travolta or any of the actors/actresses in this movie. Writers, maybe, but actors, no. Maybe I'm just keeping my expectations too high. Maybe I just don't know a good movie when I see one. But I think that if it weren't for the great Bee Gees soundtrack, I would ditch this movie altogether.",Null,1,2,12 March 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Just See It For Harrison Ford's Sake, Okay?? :-)
","Harrison Ford is DA BOMB in this movie, but, to tell you the truth, the very first time I saw this movie, it wasn't as good people said it would be. Generally, I have no opinion on this film--I don't LOVE it with all my heart, but I'm not anti-Indiana Jones, or anything. 'Raiders' is a lot better than SOME films I've seen....no names mentioned, people! Anyway, there are pros and cons to this movie:Pros:1)Harrison Ford2)Karen Allen is a good heroine3)It was directed by Steven Spielberg!4)There are no trashy/crappy love scenes in it 5)REALLY good stunts 6)It's in Egypt! 7)Indiana Jones kills Nazis--now can you REALLY hate that?? :-)Now for the cons:Cons:1)Indiana Jones is more like Superman disguised in a Stetson than an archaeologist--I KNOW, I KNOW, that's part of the reason why he's so supposedly 'cool,' but, I mean, c'mon, people, get real, he's shot in the arm and hanging onto his whip from this truck that's dragging him along a gravel road at 55 miles per hour--I think there would be a LITTLE chance that he would maybe just DIE. I guess what I'm saying is that some things Indy can do are just a little unbelievable for me. 2)No offense, but do ya think they could've done a LITTLE better job at making sure that the audience couldn't see the glass cage the snakes were in? 3)I know 'Raiders' was made in 1981, and they didn't have all the fancy computer technology crud we take for granted these days, but the special effects were, well, kind of cheap looking compared to some movies made at that time.  You could tell the ghost effects were kind of 'borrowed' from Speilberg's 'Poltergeist,' and the part where the dude's face melted was just, well, *weird.* 4)This movie is too overrated. 5)What's up with the ending??????????????????Well, now you know my view on 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' It's not one of my *favorites*, but, if I had to, I think I could watch it again. The problem is that this movie is too overrated, like 'Titanic.' (Although, personally, I like this movie better than Titanic, believe it or not!) And how could anyone hate a movie with Harrison Ford?? :-)",Null,0,0,11 March 1999
Spartacus," A Triumphant Tragedy
","Everyone did an excellent job in Spartacus. Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov, Stanley Kubrick---this is one of those movies where everybody is great doing their part. Spartacus has all the elements of a great Hollywood 'epic,' and, thanks to  a fine cast and fine filming, that's exactly what it is. This movie really gets you--you think that Spartacus is going to defeat the Romans, free the slaves--and he comes so close, yet just doesn't make it! I also thought that the ending was very sad, typical of Kubrick. You can really get into this film because you just keep wanting to find out what's going to happen next. Spartacus does an excellent job of showing the cruelty of life and slavery. Be sure to see it, if you can!!-2001Rulz",Null,1,1,14 August 1999
Citizen Kane," A Great Movie, But Not THE Greatest......
","I just saw Citizen Kane and thought it was an excellent movie. Not only was it good for 1941, the fact that Orson Welles wrote, directed, produced, and starred in it at the age of 25 was even more surprising. This is actually a very depressing movie, especially the Rosebud thing at the end. Another thing that makes this movie so true (well, besides the fact it was based on the life of a true human being, William Randolph Hurst) was that Charlie Kane was such a human character. He was someone who was very nice, intelligent, and caring, yet on the other hand, he was also selfish, rude, and a spoiled brat. The way that Welles is able to use the camera and lighting in this movie is excellent. Although this is a very good film, I just don't think that it's worthy of the title 'The greatest American film of all time.' But, I really shouldn't say that, because, um, I have to admit I can't think of a film that IS worthy of that title! I think everyone should see this film, and just enjoy a good story about good characters, and forget about special effects for once. If all movies had a story as good as this, the Hollywood industry would be a lot better. See this movie if you can!!!!-2001Rulz :-)",Null,0,3,27 June 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Cracked Me Up
","I know absolutely nothing about the Cold War or anything else that was going on back in the 60's, but in Dr. Strangelove, I just kept watching the darn thing anyway!! I love this movie because they don't jump out right at you with the humor and jokes, but you still find yourself laughing. Everyone in this movie was awesome, and Peter Sellers (what a great job in Lolita!) as Dr. Strangelove was the coolest--and funniest. Slim Pickens' 'bomb ride' was also hilarious. I guess you really have to have a 'different' sort of sense of humor to really understand the jokes in this movie and find them really funny, but I would recommend it to anyone who loves war movies, comedies, and 60's-type history. I'm not just saying all of this stuff because I like Stanley Kubrick, it's just that he really knows how to make a riot out of a deadly situation. They need to make more movies like this. 3 out of 4 stars for the great Dr. Strangelove. -2001Rulz",Null,0,0,12 August 1999
Being John Malkovich," If this is 'brilliant,' then my home videos are ingenious.
","Okay, I'm probably going to get a lot of hate mail after people read this review, but I thought Being John Malkovich was an awful movie. And if not awful, then certainly overrated. The only reason I rented this movie (thank God I didn't waste $6.50 on it at the theater) was because all of my friends/relatives were saying what a great movie it was. And it didn't sound that bad at first---the plot outline actually sounded pretty interesting. And not to say that the acting wasn't good, either, but for some reaosn, I just did NOT like this film. AT ALL. First of all, if you think this movie is 'funny' or 'hilarious,' then your sense of humor is way way beyond mine. I thought the idea of the 7th-and-a-half floor was humorous, a few of the little jokes at the beginning were okay, but after that, I didn't laugh at all. Considering this is supposed to be mostly a comedy, it makes the movie very boring.Second, the movie is just too weird and unbelieveable for me. And the weird thing is, I love cult films and strange movies. I have no problem with bizarre supernatural powers in movies and actually like that kind of thing. Being John Malkovich....I don't know, you just don't get it. Okay, when the building with the portal was built, how did the portal get there? I am still trying to figure out this part. The Lester guy showed us pictures of the office building with the portal inside of it being built---where does the opening to John Malkovich come into being? How does it work? It's just too radical for me to accept and it's probably one of the reasons I didn't like the movie. Another part that had me wondering was when Lottie was chasing Maxine with the gun and they went from the locker room to the bus.....oh, never mind, I'm just getting more confused. It was not brilliant, it was weird. There's a difference.Third, the whole plot, when you really boil down to it, is about a perverted puppteer (Craig) who wants to have sex with his coworker. That's it. And the rest is just the scenarios and problems he encounters while trying to get that sex. And, no offense to lesbians/gays, but the whole thing with Lottie and Maxine in love was just sick. I'm fine with movies about homosexuality (Boys Don't Cry, And The Band Played On, etc.) but it just didn't fly for me in John Malkovich.The saving grace of this film was the acting. John Cusak, Cameron Diaz(!), John Malkovich, etc. all did great at their parts. You have to give the movie credit for one thing.Well, I'm sorry, but there you have it. I can't say that I enjoyed Being John Malkovich. Some movies are so bizarre, their brilliant; John Malkovich is so bizarre, it's stupid. And BORING.",Null,2,5,25 June 2000
Saving Private Ryan," It Should Have Won Best Picture
","I don't see why I even bother adding my comment on this film, there's already, like, 780, or something, but let me just say that Saving Private Ryan should have definately without-a-doubt won best picture of 1998. I mean, who else besides 20-something women REALLY thought Shakespeare was worthy of Best Picture? Come on, people, Saving Private Ryan was the best film in years. I was so sad when seeing the ending of this movie that I was crying. The beginning grabbed you by the heart and wouldn't let you go! I have never seen a war movie better than this. The people saying that all of that violence wasn't necessary had better realize that Saving Private Ryan was only a fraction of how bloody and awful REAL war can be. Speilberg did an excellent job directing this movie, and I felt very sorry that he did not win best picture after all that work. Tom Hanks did an excellent job at his part, and, although the acting was not exactly top-notch, no one in this movie did a bad job at all. Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies, and was ripped off when it came to the Oscars. I don't know how people can hate this movie, say it was bad, or tell me that it was boring. I would watch Saving Private Ryan again any day. Go see this movie!!!!!!!!!**** stars out of ****-2001Rulz",Null,0,1,14 August 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!!!
","Sorry, just had to get that out of my system. Okay, sorry, people, but PLEASE don't tell me that this was made by Steven Spielberg. NO!! It can't be! How could this piece of crap disgrace the Almighty Hollywood King's name? Why did they have to make it a version of Godzilla? Is this movie even worthy of the title: 'The sequel to 'Jurassic Park'?'We're all entitled to our personal opinions in this country, you may think what you like, but, no offense, this movie was just unnecessary and stupid. Okay, so maybe parts of it were good, but it was nothing near Jurassic Park. Now *that* was a good movie. But this? Yeah, right. (They couldn't even get Sam Neill back in it!!) I was barely able to sit through all of this movie. Ian's daughter, Kelly, had no part what-so-ever---she basically just followed everyone around. And when that huge trailer is hanging off of the cliff being suspended by that little car? Give me a break!I honestly don't remember anything about this movie--I don't WANT to remember anything about this movie, to tell you the truth--and therefore cannot critique it as well. I just think it's too overrated and that Spielberg and the gang could've done better.-2001RulzP.S.--Oh, and aren't we forgetting the ORIGINAL inspriration for  'The Lost World?' No, I'm not talking about Michael Crichton's novel, I mean Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book 'The Lost World.' 'Oh, well, guys, we don't *need* to credit *him*, right?? The general public would think that seeing a movie that was based on a book by an author who wrote classics is uncool, huh??'",Null,0,0,15 March 1999
Back to the Future Part III," Great Movie
","BTTF3 is a good closing of the trilogy. Although I have to say it's probably the weakest of the three, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. All the actors portray their characters with the usual greatness, and I especially love the climax of the movie where Doc and Clara get stuck on the train. I also thought the 'Jules & Verne' thing was really cute.....ooops, I better not give away all of the secrets to the movie! Although BTTF is really sci-fi, Western fans can enjoy this one, too. All-in-all, a great way to end an excellent trilogy. You have to see BTTF3.-2001RulzP.S.-Although I love all the BTTF movies, I really hope they don't make a BTTF4. I mean, what could they possibly make it about? I think it would be a major waste of time and money, and it would be one heck of a job getting the original actors to come back. And I'm sure the almost-40-year-old Michael J. Fox is willing to play a teenager again......Just keep things the way they are now. BTTF4 would lack original material and wouldn't appeal to the rather dumb majority of teens today. Nowadays, almost every teenager wants a movie with violence, sex, cussing, and really hot guys & babes. And BTTF (fortunately) does not have these things. As a great man once said, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Thanks. :-)",Null,0,0,20 June 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Rest In Peace, Stanley Kubrick
","In a way, I consider myself 'lucky' to have been able to have seen 2001 while Stanley Kubrick was still alive. His death was one of the few deaths in showbiz that has actually made me sad. I absolutely *love* this movie--note the screen name, people. :-) Kubrick did a great job of directing this movie (as he has always done :-) ) and Kier Dullea gives an excellent performance as Dave. My favorite character, though, would just have to be the evil computer, HAL, voiced by Douglas Rain. This movie shows that pretty soon, instead of us running the machines, the machines are going to be running us. I also thought the beginning, though a little boring and long, was interesting. The apes, who have learned to use bones and sticks in self defense, have just discovered the weapon, man's shield of protection, yet also its destruction. I think the special effects in this movie are awesome (even for 1968!). The part where Dave was entering Jupiter was cool. People who think this movie is pointless and is too confusing to get aren't just smart enough to appreciate *real* movies. I have to admit that I myself still haven't entirely figured out every little metaphor or puzzle in this movie, but just see 2001: A Space Odyssey, and you'll love it! THANK YOU, STANLEY KUBRICK!! YOU WILL BE REMEMBERED!!!",Null,0,1,11 April 1999
This Is Spinal Tap," How could you NOT like this movie?! :-P
","WHERE HAS THIS MOVIE BEEN HIDING ALL OF MY LIFE?! I just saw it for the first time a few days ago and cried myself to death laughing! This nails the 70's/80's rock world cliches right on and spoofs them in such a brilliant and hilarious way that your sides will be splitting from laughing so hard! The Spinal Tap members are so stupid that they're ingenious! Of course, you have be sort of 'in the know' about glam rock and 70's/80's music to understand many of the jokes, but usually, most of them are so funny that you'll still find them amusing by themselves. It's impossible to choose a favorite part of this movie because all the scenes are so great! From Derek's shell that wouldn't open to the amp that went to 11 to the spontaneously combustable drummers, This Is Spinal Tap will have you rolling on the laughing the whole way through! Do yourself a HUGE favor and see This Is Spinal Tap!....and buy the tape, and the t-shirts, and the soundtrack, and the poster............On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it an 11!....hehe :-)",Null,0,1,25 June 2000
Titanic," One Word: OVERRATED
","Okay, um, tell me again, what is so good about this movie???????? How did it win best picture next to 'Good Will Hunting?' Why does everyone obsess over Leonardo DiCaprio?? I didn't even cry at 'Titanic.' Now, I am a girl, but have only seen this movie once. And almost every single one of my friends loves 'Titanic,' bawled their eyes out at the end, and adores Leonardo DiCaprio & Co. Me? I think 'Armageddon' is sadder than this movie. (I nearly cried at that one) All I hear is 'Titanic this,' or 'Titanic that.' I'm sick of it! I have to admit the special effects and set designs are good, but this is just Romeo & Juliet set in 1915. I guess I just didn't 'feel the romance.' I'm not an unemotional person, but I've seen movies a lot more moving (and entertaining) than 'Titanic'. I almost *want* 'The Phantom Menace' to beat its highest box office gross record. :-) If you haven't seen 'Titanic,' don't take everyone's word for it if they say it's the greatest movie on earth, okay?? Thanks.-2001Rulz",Null,3,4,11 April 1999
Paths of Glory," THE BEST!
","I thought Paths of Glory was gonna be SO boring once I started watching it, but I soon found myself engrossed in the movie. This is an excellent film, and wonderfully done for 1957. I really did not expect Paths of Glory to be as good as I thought it would be. Kirk Douglas is wonderful in his role, as are all the other actors. ;-) It's hard to believe that this was a box-office failure when it was first released. Paths of Glory isn't just a film for fans of war movies, if you like drama and suspense, you should really see this one. I thought it was really depressing and sad, but any movie that can provoke somone's emotions is excellent. This is pure genius!! STANLEY KUBRICK ROCKS!!!!!!**** out of **** for Paths of Glory-2001Rulz",Null,0,0,12 August 1999
Back to the Future Part II," The Best Sequel
","Of course, BTTF2 isn't as good the original, but it is still a great movie. This is one exception where the sequel is either better or is just as good as the original (kind of like The Empire Strikes Back was better than Star Wars). Although this movie is very dark and complicated, it still has the same great material that made the first BTTF such an awesome movie. If you've seen BTTF1, be sure to see BTTF2!!!",Null,0,1,20 June 1999
Blade Runner," I LOVE THIS MOVIE
","Hands down, this is THE best sci-fi/adventure movie EVER to be made. (I had to add the 'adventure' part to that little genre because 2001 is the best 'pure' sci-fi--note my user name) Blade Runner is MUCH better than Star Wars, better than the Terminator, better than Independence Day or Armageddon or the Matrix, it's SUCH an awesome movie!!!! I have to admit, the only reason I became interested in this movie was because I knew it had something to do with Harrison Ford, but I ended up liking everything about this movie and going out and buying the book by Philip Dick. The set designs in this movie will just blow you away!! I could not believe this was actually made in 1982. What's more, the original novel was actually written in 1968, WAY ahead of its time. I know I'm just rambling on and on about this movie, but, PLEASE see this movie if you haven't, because if you don't see this movie, you're missing out on a lot. Trust me. Oh, and don't give all the credit to Harrison Ford, either. Rutger Hauer is probably the best in this movie performance-wise. And, we HAVE to give half of the credit to Vangelis' CREEPY music score!! Awesome!! Ridley Scott did a brilliant job of directing this movie. I like this SOOOOOO much better than all the Star Wars movies combined. So, if you ever feel like a good sci-fi/adventure movie, go rent Blade Runner!!!!!P.S.-Oh, and if you enjoyed this movie, be sure to read the original novel, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' by Philip K. Dick. The book isn't really like the film, but I thought the actual novel was better.-2001Rulz :-)",Null,0,0,27 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!!!!!
","After seeing all the crappy 'scary' movies that I've seen in my life, I was very reluctant to go out and see yet another 'thriller.' But little did I know that The Sixth Sense is one of THE best (and scariest!!) movies that I have ever seen, if not THE best. The acting was superb, the plot was frightening and original, and all the great plot twists made the movie excellent. This movie makes the Haunting look like crap. The Sixth Sense has no sex, very little violence and cussing, and manages to give you the scare of your life without special effects, blood and gore, and cheap thrills. But if you are one of those druggees who only thinks that slasher+sex movies like Scream are scary, this movie is too complicated for you little brains to handle. So, I ORDER you to go out and see this movie!! Believe me, you WILL NOT regret it. At all. Have fun!!'The Sixth Sense'----  rating~********** (out of 10)-2001Rulz",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Back to the Future," THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!!!!!
","WOW!!!!! This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. It's better than Star Wars, better than Titanic, better than Jurassic Park, better than Saturday Night Fever, and better than any crap Hollywood producers pull off these days. I have to admit that 2001: A Space Odyssey is my favorite movie of all time, but this movie is my favorite in the 'Adventure/Comedy' category. If you don't like this movie, I seriously recommend professional help for you. This movie has it all: adventure, comedy, romance, sci-fi, and suspense. Plus, the sequels to it are actually very good, unlike some sequels that have been made to movies. You will love this movie, so, if you can, PLEASE see it!! Christopher Lloyd is awesome, Michael J. Fox is even better. Great actors, great plot, great music, great jokes, just plain great MOVIE.",Null,0,1,20 June 1999
