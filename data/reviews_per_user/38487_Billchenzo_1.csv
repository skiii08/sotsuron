Casablanca," Timeless Classic (Bogart is a cinematic icon)
","A true masterpiece that will never get old. Without doubt, one of the best romance movies of all time, parallelled perhaps only by the likes of 'Gone with the wind' or 'An affair to remember'. This movie will take you on a ride through every emotion imaginable and allow you to relate to and empathise with the characters with ease. This movie was not made with the expectancy of being an amazing watch, however this Warner Bros' A-List became one of the all-time greats and will wow you with its famous lines and beautiful scenes. For those of you who refrain from watching older, monochrome movies and prefer to watch newer Romance films such as 'Twilight' or 'The Notebook', please give this movie a chance and you will not regret it. Prepare to witness a real classic.",10,4,5,22 April 2012
