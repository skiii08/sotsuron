The Hangover," The Hangover Review: By Jakkrabbit.
","My Review: I gave The Hangover a 8 out of 10. I thought this movie was excellent on the point of setup. Everything that would be previewed within the movie would come back with conclusive endings to what was previously revealed from past parts of the movie. Nothing was left out. The movie was absolutely hilarious, It almost defines the word. I thought this movie topped Superbad, and i never thought that could be done cause in my opinion Superbad was the funniest movie I've seen in awhile until of course I've seen The Hangover. In The Hangover, Not only was a lot of these actions that was visible hilarious, A lot of the lines were right on target; And what i mean by that is in other Comedy movies they would try and say some line and it would be totally random and it would supposed to be funny but in fact it is not and makes no sense at all. That rarely happens within this movie, Almost every line is agreeable and will produce a laugh from you. This movie will be an instant classic in many cases. My rating and reasoning: 8/10. This movie was very funny one of the best comedies i have seen since Superbad. I cant say this is an absolute perfect and complete Comedy, and that's why it did not receive a 10 from me. But i tell you it is close to it. It could had just a LITTLE bit more put into some things to make it a perfect Comedy.Positives and Negatives:(+): Very funny lines and actions.(+): Everything fell into place perfectly throughout the movie.(-): Some of the lines and actions were kind of stupid and unrealistic, I don't like things like that and i always take off for it. (-): There could have been a little bit better acting in it. For example, The Hotel Check-In Lady, Lisa. I thought she did an horrible job acting.My Favorite Characters: Allan and Phil.My Favorite Random Moment: When Allan wakes up and stumbles over everything.My Favorite Line: When Chao stomps on Allan's 'Satchel' and he says ' Hey ! There are Skittles in there !' My Favorite Moment: When their all sitting at the table and Allan acts as if the baby Carlos (Tyler), Is 'pleasuring itself' By moving his hand in the motion.Recommend this Movie?: Yes, Most definitely. If you haven't seen this, it follows in the Must-See Category.Final Word: I am absolutely stoked for The Hangover 2 to come out, Im curious to see how the story will take place from where it left off. Its gonna be hard to top this, But it will be possibly great also.",10,2,4,2 February 2010
