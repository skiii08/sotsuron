Skyfall," Masterpiece
","Being a teenage girl, I've always thought Bond was pretty good- I remember watching 'Goldfinger' on TV at about the age of five or six- however over the years I never really paid attention to it all- I always liked it, but I wasn't fanatic about it. I saw 'Casino Royale' on DVD, but I have never seen Quantum of Solace. I have also seen Dr No, but none of the other films.My mum booked IMAX tickets for me, her, my dad and my boyfriend- I went to see it today, and absolutely LOVED it. Daniel Craig is absolutely fantastic and his performance in this movie is outstanding- everything from the many excellent stunts and action scenes to the more quiet moments such as when he was talking with M (who by the way, was brilliant, but of course, it's Judi Dench, so obviously she was brilliant).The opening credit scene was obviously fantastic- already in love with the song before I went to see it.The cinematography was beautiful- the locations were absolutely stunning, especially Scotland (whether they actually shot it there or not I don't know).And of course, not only the trademark gun was back, but the trademark car was back- I quite like cars but I am not a petrol head like my father, but even I grinned like the Cheshire Cat when the garage door opened to reveal this beauty of a vehicle.So overall, the film was AMAZING. If you're thinking of going to see it, go. You will most certainly not be disappointed. Nicely handled 007!",10,4,21,2 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Such a great movie
","I can honestly say this movie is just fantastic. If finally hits you how much Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown up, and how their acting has developed tremendously. The beginning brings back the memories of the three normal little kids who, ten years ago, set out to become wizards and a witch. The enormity of what their task is does hit them at times throughout the story, and it almost breaks the trio up. But they pull through, always fighting, always getting stronger.The story has also become a lot darker- yes, we knew something as dark and dangerous as this would someday come, but now it's finally arrived. They are constantly in danger, constantly being watched.The great thing is that there is some comedy. Of course, the famous and popular house elf Dobby returns, along with Kreacher (who isn't as funny obviously, but still, how great these little creatures are). The romance also offers a light-heartedness to the film, which at certain points is much needed. We don't get to see much development of the Harry/Ginny relationship, but a huge leap is made to the possible relationship of Ron and Hermione.I thought this film was truly brilliant. A huge congratulations to the cast and crew, and of course, David Yates, the wonderful director. A great triumph once again.",10,0,2,18 April 2011
