Changeling," true story
","sorry for my English.I will not say anything about outstanding play of Angelina Jolie or others. I'd just say, that the most horrible thing in this story that it really happened. And not only that it happens everyday in normal life. Just heard a story that happened not in those days, happened two-three years ago in Russia. The guy new his parents were killed by local police, he tried to get to them with help of federal security service (former name K G B). He thought they can be trusted, but they threw him to the Psychiatric clinic... But unlike this story he never came back from there.Besides that, in USSR in the times of Andropov's ruling, they have built such clinics all over the country. So called medical stars have invented the 'Slowflowing schizophrenia'. And used that term in order to close up those who weren't needed to them. It was easier than putting them to prison, because for incarceration you still need a fact of crime. For detention and maintenance in a psychiatric clinic, you just needed a verdict of doctor.",9,2,3,14 July 2009
The Hurt Locker," It worth watching, the original director's message
","Basically the movie is definitely not bad, i'd rather say good - an original message that war is a drug. Sound giving, especially the plot, the play, the dialogs, the reality of a country in an 'after war' period. However terribly worn out theme about heroic adventures of the American soldiers on a way of democratization of the world. I'm sorry, i'm not trying to offend anyone's feelings, but not all soldiers in modern conflict zones are such a heroes. Comparing to 'Redacted' in describing the soldiers' day-to-day routine, this movie almost shows us that war is actually not a worst thing that could happen to people, no matter if you're occupied or you are the occupier. I suppose that what is shown in this movie is true to some extent, and not all Iraqis feeling them selves as occupied nation, but i'm still in doubt. But it definitely worth watching.",8,2,7,19 January 2010
