Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 7/10, but with a volume 1 bonus
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 brings to an end what part 1 had started, but unfortunately in an a bit disapointing, because unsurprising way. Compared with Vol. 1 the second part has not much that you would not expect and is not able to impress as a movie by itself. It is a must for everybody who has enjoyed the first installment, but don´t wait for an enhancement. Especially the last bit is not much of an masterpiece, since the plot is brought forward in a pretty artless way. The movie lacks of the flair and atmosphere, which convinced many a couple of months again - not unexpected, but nevertheless not completely worthy.",6,0,1,27 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Without Anakin this movie would be great.
","It´s a cool movie, much more Star Wars than Episode I, including great fight scenes (especially Joda of course) and with the guys who designed the clone-army the best aliens I have ever seen in a movie. But from the first moment where Anakin appears George Lucas screams in your face: 'Watch out, this guy will become very evil'. The storyline offers so many possibilities to let the character of Anakin develop, but Lucas simply completely failed with this part of the movie, since Anakin does not develop at all: From the beginning he is arrogant and bigheaded. Together with completely primitive dialogs ('I should be the most powerful Jedi of all time!') Anakins story simply destroys the good impression the rest of movie gives: If you take a look at his behavior, nobody can understand why Padme should love him at all and the moronic death of his mother makes you just shake your head. Not even the best actor could have made Anakins character and his story seem believable (because of the crappy script) and thus Hayden Christensen has not a chance to succeed. Does George Lucas think his audience only consists of idiots or why does he have to present Anakins tale so clearly that you feel insulted and without leaving room for any imagination. I will give this movie a 7, which regarding my harsh stricture shows how good many parts this movie has. But I am still disappointed because I know how good this movie could have been. The way it is it´s cool, but far away in quality from Lord of the Rings.",4,0,0,29 May 2002
