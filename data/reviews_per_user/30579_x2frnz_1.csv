The New World," Rafel Film Center Preview 142 minutes of bliss!
","I didn't see the version that opened on Christmas in LA + NYC. The print I saw on Sunday Jan 8, 2006 ran 142 minutes by my watch. A lot of people had to get up and use the restroom but all of them came back. I found the movie ravishing in it's deep and mysterious beauty. This is not just pictorial attractiveness (like MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA) but a splendid meditation which gives grown up people a chance to reflect on their own loves, lives, choices and gives them room to have their own feelings if they are so inclined. It's a novel experience these days when most films badger, cajole and manipulate shamelessly to less effect. This is a surprising and delicious movie FOR GROWN UPS. Of course, I wish I could see it at only private screenings and an intermission would be nice in any movie over 2 hours. These are minor considerations. I will be seeing this film several times in the theatre. I hope the audiences will be quiet! There is no bass hum to let you know when things are getting exciting and the film itself is rather quiet. p.s.As with the AWFUL 'Titanic'- Any young man smart enough to take his romantically inclined sweetheart to this film will be very lucky indeed! This is swoon inducing romantic delight!",10,6,18,11 January 2006
