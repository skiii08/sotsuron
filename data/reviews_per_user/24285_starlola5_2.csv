The Blair Witch Project," F-
","I didn't see it at the theater, I rented it from Blockbuster.  After all the hype from the net and reviews, I was sure I was in for a scare.  I ended up checking my watch to see how much time was left.  I ended up fast forwarding through much of it, and couldn't even tell what part of the guy they found in the shirt.  I kept hoping that the movie would get better, but it didn't.  The only parts that were half decent were the interviews with the old lady and the fishermen.  Unfortunately, these things were not built up on in the screenplay (oh, forgot, THERE WAS NO SCREENPLAY, could that have been why it was so boring?  No characters, no words other than those of the four letter variety, and absolutely no real scares.)  Frighteningly boring, especially for all the hype that surrounded it.  You never see the witch in the movie, and that was supposed to make it that much scarier. But like the witch, scary parts were never seen.  Hearing that girl yell 'F this' and 'F that' was so sickeningly annoying.  But maybe she's right... This movie does deserve an F, and an F minus if possible.  Don't waste your time.",Null,1,2,28 July 2000
X-Men," Fun to watch
","X-Men, I must say, was really a good movie.  The special effects were fabulous, and the plot was short, but was clear and got it's message across. The characters were developed nicely, especially Wolverine.  This is a movie that you should definitely take the time to see this summer.  You won't be disappointed.",Null,0,0,28 July 2000
