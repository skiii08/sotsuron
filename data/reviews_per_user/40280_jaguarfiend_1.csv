The Rock," Great Film, awesome story, very realistic in all of ways
","The whole sad story of illegal BlackOps in other countries carried out by Marine Force Recon is entirley true, and sad that the details had to be covered up from the men's families. This movie is great for emphasising that. Awesome story. NOTE: Not realy a war movie...Now for skeptics... VX Gas IS real, just may be a tad milder in it's effects than the movie shoed usAs for thermite plasma, I'm pretty sure something like that exists (really hot plasma, simple enough)And besides a knife flying straight after being thrown, MP5's with ridiculously large capacity magazines, and 10 second fuse grenades, everything else in the movie is fairly realistic.I just gotta say 1 more thing, isn't it funny how it makes a cocking noise when people pull out their pistol sidearms?AWESOME MOVIE: MY FAVORITE! NO MATTER WHO SAID WHAT, JUST SEE IT AND DECIDE FOR yourself.",10,1,2,8 July 2001
