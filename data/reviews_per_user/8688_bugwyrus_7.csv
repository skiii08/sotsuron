The Lobster," Love against all Oddity
","Let me start my review by saying that if i could describe this movie in three words they would be: Odd, Weird and Strange.
This is a typical slow paced European movie, with a Greek Director.
I'll start with a small synopsis describing the movie.
Single people in a near future, according to the laws of 'The City', are taken to The Hotel a kind of reformatory prison, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days OR as a consequence of failing they are transformed into a animal of their choice.
The protagonist (Colin Farell) chooses a Lobster, hence the name of the movie.
Lets start with the GOOD... Colin Farell and Rachel Weiss are great actors, and actually do a good job with the script handed to them. The cinematography, and the scenery used in the movie were nice to see.
Now the BAD... This is the weirdest, strangest movie i have seen by far this year.
The strange bad script, that some might consider to be intellectual and a well done satire, i consider to be just absurd. Nonsense and rubish lines are all over the place. I could excuse the short Budget the director had, and i know this movie tries to be like a theather play, but the fact is that the movie plot is just ridiculous from the beggining till the end with a runtime of almost 2 hours of Borefest. I just laughed in a scene were a women makes a bad suicide attempt, by jumping from the hotel into her demise, but utterly failing. So she stayed on the floor agonizing in pain, screaming! NOW tell me, is this funny or nauseating???
Instead of saying to you to avoid the movie, i recommend for you to see the movie.You will like all the other movies you see in the future so much more.
If you want to see a slow paced, but very well scripted, european vibe movie see BLINDNESS instead it is great. It is scripted after a book made by a Nobel prize winner of my country Portugal called Jose Saramago.
P.S: I Wish a Lobster would destroy this bad script with their bare hands, i mean claws :) I give a 2 out of 10 for the actors performance.",2,0,1,28 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," DOWNFALL OF SKYWALKER - Fulfill your Destiny Disney, Sell more toys :(
","I am a huge Star wars Fan, loving everything from movies, tv animated series so even being angry with this trilogy as a whole, can't be unfair and give a 1 score or take some of the merits of this movie.
The movie has good special effects, thought they were not very impressive. It has two or three good cameos. But the problem with this movie is that the characters are really week from the beggining of the trilogy till the end.
The Locations the heroes visit are very uninpired, being the Sith Planet of EXOGUL the worst. And the Space fights, and Lightsaber Duels were really lame.
The Plot is simple in the oppening credits, everyone including heroes and baddies learn that the emperor is alive, and go and try to find him. Kylo meets the emperor on the planet Exegol, and the emperor asks him to kill rey. On the other end Rey's Gang go on a mission to find a device called the wayfinder, to discover the emperors planet location. Rey and Kylo Fights in some locations, and in the end they fight the emperor and Win...the end.
From the very beggining of the movie it is revealed that emperor Palpatine was alive all this time, posing as Snoke. And snoke body is actrually clone controled by the emperor, and he poisoning Kylo Ren's mind the whole time. So Snokes Death in TLJ, was allowed by the emperor.
So JJ Abrahms, manages to try to make some damage control of the plot holes in The Last Jedi. But was he succefull? Not for me.
We see Leia training Rey, and a small Flashback of Leia training with luke, but does that explain Leia superpowers in TLJ? Not by a scratch.
They give a small Holdo Manuever explanation, in the form of a small joke saying its a 1000 to 1 manuever. So what JJ does in this movie, is that he adresses TLJ plot holes with small explanations that are not satisfying.
Is Luke Skywalker character saved in the movie? kind of... Luke even says that his actions were wrong in TLJ and that Rey should respect her lightsaber, punching himself in the face. But Mark Hammill has literally 5 lines of Dialogue in the movie, when in the TLJ he acted as Grumpy Old Bad all the movie it isn't enought for fans like me. I wanted to see a interection betwin Luke and the emperor.
We learn later that Rey is Palpatines Grandaughter, in a reminescent way of Empire Strikes Back, she even thinks in jumping into oblivion like Luke did, but here the scene is a lot less impactfull.
The Characters in this trilogy are really weak.
Rey is overpowered, just because of her lineage, in this movie she has the force unleashed powers to take down ships with the force, and unwillingly makes a force lightning without even learning how to do it in the first place??? WTF, just because shes is Palpatines Grandaughter she can do a force lightning? Vader never did one. And the Daisy Ridley acting is really bad. Leia was a much better women character than Rey, she was brave, Rey is whinning all the time.
Kylo Ren continues his redemption ark, but in the end he dies in a ridiculous way, giving his life for Rey, but doestn deserve to appear has a force ghost alongside Luke and Leia in Tatoine... Terrible writing. The only good scene was the one that Han Solo almost forgives Ben Solo for killing him, Ah ah ah. But believe me this Scene was the best scene in the movie, not kidding.
Leia appears in a few scenes, and dies in a strange way, in a scene with little emotion, you just really fell for chewie. General Hux, is the most useless character in the whole franchise now, even worse tahn Phasma, he gets killed by a lame General Pryde that replaced him as the 2 in command. Tarkin was a great commander this guys are just weaklings not menacing at all. Poe Dameron, continues to be a Han Solo wannabe, and just annoys me. Finn gets less Goffy this time and i liked him much more this time, and i say this bacause he was the character with better backstory (Ex Stormtrooper ashamed of what he did and wanting revenge of First Order). But what was what he wanted to tell Rey, throughout the movie? That he was in love with her of course.So what about Rose Tico? And Jannah now? PLOT HOLE, in TLJ looked like rose and finn would have a romance, here looks like he loves Rey again as in the Force Awakens.
Characters Crapped by JJ in this movie. Hux, has i already said. Max Kanata and Rose Tico now are just useless characters, that almost had no screentime and influence in the story. And JJ added another three useless characters for this movie Jannah, Zori Bliss and Beaumont. Why i ask? I would prefer more screentime for Lando Calrissian and the emperor and even Chewbacca.
Another Ridiculous thing is the Knights of Ren? You see them in the Desert all Badass, but they dont engage in battle. And we expect a backstory to them, you get none. Then they reapper in the end to fight Kylo Ren, and th saber fight was even worse than the Snoke throne room in TLJ, with the Red Guardians.
The plot quality during the movie is really weak, but the ending really killed it for me. Rey is the choosen one, and Anakin wasn't the balance of the force after all. He doesn't appear in this movie in any form, and he should in the end when Rey confronts the emperor with kylo ren. The Last 20 minutes of the movie are the worst part of the movie for me. The space battle is underwellming, Knights of Ren Duel with Kylo is a joke, Rey fight with the emperor is a small Force Lightining Scene, where she repels Palpatine Force Lightning to himself Desintigrating him in the process (Terrible CGI by the way). Rey dies from the backlash of the force lightining, Kylo Ren comes back from a pit, revives Rey kisses her and dies like Luke did in TLJ, giving is lifeforce to rey, he disapears and dies. Then a party in the galaxy, we see Cloud City, Ewoks, and a few other planets. Then after that we see Rey going to tatoine to lukes old house, calling herself Rey Skywalker (Ugh), and looking at leia ans luke force ghosts but not Ben Solo.
Now my overall STAR WARS movies scores.
Empire Strikes Back 9.5, Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One 9, A New Hope and a Return of the Jedi both 8.5, Attack of the Clonesand Solo 7.5, The Phantom Menace and The Force Awakens a 7, The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker a 6. So the three last trilogy movies are the worst of the whole franchise. If this trilogy was the first to appear in the theaters in the seventies, ir would't had the sucess it has now. But Disney, if you want to improve, sign Jon Favreau or Christopher Nolan to do the Knights of the Old Republic Trilogy, and if you folow the videogames source material, it will be the most Epic Star Wars trilogy of all time. Favreau is making a real good Star Wars story with the Mandalorian, and Nolan is the best director and script writer nowadays.
I am Sad i wanted the Epic endingof the Skywalker Saga, instead we got a movie with uninteresting characters and uninspired plot. I know its not just JJ Abrahms fault, Because Rian Johnson did a terrible job, but the execution of this movie is really bad. Why dont you hear the fans? We had so great ideas for this movie. Another thing is the movie plot was leaked 3 months ago, and it was 100% right, don't you learn from your mistakes? The name of the movie should have been THE DOWNFALL OF SKYWALKER score 6",6,1,2,19 December 2019
The Favourite," A Rise to Power, only to realize the higher you go Up, bigger the Downfall
","Let me start to say that yesterday i saw the Lobster of the same director Yorgos Lathimos and i Hated it, yet this movie i just Love it. And because of it, i went this see this movie with a lot of doubt, but this movie was great.
This movie is a huge improvement over the Lobster, even if it can still be a sinister movie, and weird in it's own way.
The thing is that the Budget is a lot bigger, being a Medievel 18 century England setup helps a lot, and this movie has a lot more straightforward script without ambiguous interpretations has the Lobster did. And there are no dull momments in this movie, (except the last thirty minutes, The movie should have been shorter), and the pace of the movie feels right this time.
The Favourite, is a exceptionally well scripted movie, with great clever dialogue and a top-notch dark humour that puts a smile to your face has the movie develops.
To explain the Plot of the movie is a easy task. It's the story of a ill Queen(Olivia Colman), that has a women of her confidence (Rachel Weiss) that makes the countrys biggest decisions in her behalf. Then arives in her castle, a women (Emma Stone), that starts working has a servant, but wants to be so much more. She is a manipulating witch, that with many schemes will rise and take the place of of the trustworthy helper of the Queen from Rachel Weiss Character. The Rivalry between the Two, define the movie, has the one who gets the Queens Favour at the End is the Favourite.
The Actors Performances, are amazing. With Olivia Colman with the leading role has the Queen(Oscar Winner in this movie), she is just Brilliant, i remember in the Lobster as the Hotel Manager, but frankly besides these two movies i didn't remember seeing her at all. She was Great and deserved the Oscar without a doubt. Rachell Weiss, should have have th Oscar for supporting role as well, i loved her role as a all controling sort of Villain, being in the end the Queens true love. Emma Stone the true Villain, and Nicholas Hoult do both also great performances, with great depth, as evil intelligent Masterminds. Of course the director and the great plot helps the intensity of the performances a lot.
The Deception, Rivalry, Intrigue, Revenge his all shown in a very humourous and clever way. Of course you can see from a mile away what will happen in the movie latter on, but even predictable the movie ending manages to be rewarding and algo satisfying...
The Ending is Fair, because everyone gets what they deserve.
I give this one a 8 out of 10, which is a lot more that o given the Lobster (2 out of 10) Yorgos Lathimos must be praised for this well done Masterpiece",8,1,3,29 January 2020
Ex Machina," Ex Machina is a shallow EXperience
","First of all, the plot of the movie is similar to all the robot like stories... A self aware robot or AI if you prefer, that want to survive, and to feel free, and to feel human... As all the movies related to the ex-machina themathic, this one tries to question, the right of man to act as god, if a type of intelligence has the right to have free will, and if we are worthy to be humans. But this movie is shallow and very slow paced. Movies like Spielbergs AI and Ridley Scotts blade runner being the best and even Automata, of Antonio Banderas that is a weak movie approach this questions in a better way.The actors are not good enough, even her lacks the empathy to the audience. Gleeson and Isaac feel flat, hope they get better in the upcoming star wars movie. The movie doesn't have tension or suspense it should have. It is almost two hours of talking, with a very forgetfull script.People praise the ending in the reviews, as being good and having a twist. I see the ending as dull one, with no tension or feelings. And it was kind of predictable, because it follows the logic of the movie. I never cared much if the robot fate was good or bad, because there was not to much emotion, or dramatic moments, that made me wonder what happens to her.The few CGI scenes the movie has are well made, the robot characterization is good.I saw this movie at home, and I'm happy that i did, this movie doe not deserve to pay a ticket. I give this movie a 5 out of 10, since it could have been done a lot better and much more interesting, even being a low budget movie with only three characters.Want to see a movie with three characters, emotion and pace see Hard Candy, a movie with a very well written script",5,7,15,25 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I Guess the Jedi are Truly Dead from a certain Point of View
","I am a longtime Fan and for me this is the worst Star Wars movie and the most disappointing! And after seeing Rogue One (which was great) i was expecting a better movie and a lot more answers!
Rolling Credits started saying the resistance was already overun by First Order Army Offscreen between Epi 7 and 8! Sadly i wanted to see some of the Fight and in 2h30 hours movie they should include it; Then the movie starts with Poe Dameron being heroic or suicidal teasing Hux or Hugs; 1 minute of the movie saying i want to speak to General Hugs! And Hux replies: This is Hux are you not hearing me? Hugs is what a Teddy Bear? (Hux really acts like a Ted being the most useless and ridiculed villain of all time so Hugs is a good Nick for him)
Guess what? Kids on the theatre didnt get the joke!
Poe was gaining time to prepare a attack but shouldnt the First Order just shoot on sight a easy target such as 1 Tie-Fighter!?
Then Poe Alone starts destroying every Turret in a massive Ship!
Reviews criticize the Avengers type of jokes but i personally think those werent exageratted and because the movie as such low pace were a comic relief to what was happening on screen (Han Solo made a lot of one liners and they were the best) so i can escuse this! A lot of scenes in like Epi 7 were rehashed from previous movies; this time scenes from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi!
Examples: Beggining of the movie starts with a evacuation like Epi 5 but we dont get to see a lot of it in this movie!
Luke training Rey is a copy-paste of Yoda-Luke training in Epi 5: Training with rocks! theres a cave of the Dark Side and even Luke like Yoda before refuses to Train Rey;
The scene in the Throne Room between Rey Kylo and Snoke is a direct copy from Return of the Jedi;
 Snoke tries to convert Rey and tortures her the same as luke with the Emperor and Rey acts the whole time like Luke (You still have a conflict i can fell it there still good in you)
The Problem is that this scene in Epi 6 was the epic Climax Ending and this time is in the Middle of the second movie of a trilogy wtf! Complains: 
The Movie almost happens all the time in Space with Two Ships Persuing one another and on Lukes Island! I actually liked Canto Bight the Casino World but what a missed opportunity for a Lando Calrissian Cameo (hes a known Gambler) The Scriptwritters didnt answer any questions from Epi 7 in a satisfying way!
 This movie as No Climax! There is no Real Lighsaber Fight the action in this movie is really weak and character devellopment is pretty short for everyone!
 The FX were on par i even think that Epi 7 had better effects! 
The Ending of the movie is disapointing with the Battle of Krait being the lamest battle of all Star Wars Franchise!!
Key Characters Role:
Hux: Is he a General? Both Snoke and Kylo ridicules him in front of his troops when he makes a mistake and Ragdoll him like a Teddy with the force! Glesson is not a good actor at all and being the character a fool doesnt help;
Phasma: Why put her for 2 minutes just to die again in a ridicule way? Ok we got to see Gwendoline Eye this time! What a lame villain she is just Cannon Fodder! Talks bla bla fights a few seconds and gets blown up! Disney you got a action figure;
Finn: His backstory is interesting; a Renegade Stromtrooper who left the First Order because he doesnt want to be a part of genocide! 
The problem is instead of having a Badass Character wanting revenge against the First Order we get a comedy character close to Jar Jar Binks! In this movie he is a moron and i didnt found him funny at all! The Canto Bight Trip was entertaining even if it was a Wront Turn in the end; When they enter the First Order Ship with Dj i was expecting for Finn to wear is old Stormtrooper outfit like luke and han did in Epi 4; that would have been really cool;
In the end Finn tried to Redeem by Sacrificing himself to save the Resistance in Krait by going Kamikaze against the mini Deathstar Cannon Thingie! But Scriptwritters in the name of Disney Kids ruined the Ending for me! It would have been a dignifying death for Finn and a better ending for this boring Battle; But No he is one of the Good Guys and cannot die! Lets make the Finn and Rose Kiss instead! 
Also Phasmas battle is almost as big as the scene shown in the trailer; but in the the trailer it has a lot more impact! Im not lying! 
Rose: A new Character with great moral values and we got a satisfying backstory about her in Canto Bight; Also her sister get a heroic death in the beggining of the movie in that Bomber! The love interest for Finn is kind of forced; so she admires him for being a great Legend (What? For how long i mean? He was in a coma for 2 months maybe?) And she works on maintenance but in the end she is also a Pilot!? 
Shes the best develloped character and that shows how weak the plot is;
Dj: Benicio Del Toro the little time he had on screen showed that he is a great actor! Dj seemed to me the closer we will get to a Han solo character (a scoundrall) His intentions were only to save his own ass but in that scenario that is pretty acceptable; and he says to Finn that being noble leads to nothing! Hope Dj returns in epi 9;
Maz Kanata: Loved her in Epi 7 and i thought that in this movie we would learn why she was so Force Wise! But she only appears in a hollogram for 1 minute and yet she shines being a Badass!
Poe Dameron: Scriptwriters make Poe the best pilot in the universe even better than Darth Vader ridiculous!! Alone he can take all the First Order fleet for Fools; and contradicts all the leading Woman not obeying any orders! (After Leia the Chain of Command is followed only by women) It just doesnt make any sense is actions; he acts like a crazy strong Jedi but without the superpowers! I have Bb8 on my back and i am fearless! 
Chewbacca: Besides interaction with Porgs he gives Luke a Hug and thats it; poor Chewii he lost Han and the scriptwritters respect!
Yoda: When he appears he looked like a lunatic! But what Yoda said to Luke made perfect sense and he even said lines from the past movies; so i liked him for returning even for just 2 minutes! Yoda CGI was strange;
Holdo: Has Pink hair! Says a few motivational words to the crew and Sacrifices herself by throwing the Ship against the Ships of First Order in Lightspeed!? Wtf! If that is possible why dont they throw a few Kamikaze Tie Fighters instead? Also doesnt the ship have auto-pilot? RIP Admiral Ackbar is Dead now the only Male to rule the Resistance! 
Leia: Shes ok most of the time! But the Scene shes blown into Space is terrible & the CGI is really bad and Leia is not Force Strong enought to do that magic! She started to frozen so it would have made a lot more sense that the Force would create a bubble barrier and kept her in a suspended sleep till someone rescued her; it would have been unrealitic but much more believable!
And i dont understand why she lived? They could let her die in this scene in space making it a emmocional scene and it would have been a lot more respectfull for Carrie Fisher; because she past away now they will have to make a Offscreen Death in Epi 9 or make a CGI Leia and i believe that wont work at all!
Luke Skywalker: Mark Hamill is the best character and actor in the movie! Hes a Bitter man and feels responsable for the Downfall of the Jedi Temple and the Rise of the First Order & i accept that he went to isolation on a island gave up and closed himself from the force! People hate that Luke throws the lightsaber away! Say it is Offcharacter but in the context of him refusing everything from the past its a logical reaction! The scene with R2D2 (Easter Egg) is very touching and humanizes Luke making him to decide to train Rey! But why didnt Luke go with Rey and help the Resistance and have a Final Clash with Kylo like Ben vs Vader did? That would have been Amazing! Instead we get a Force Projection where we tricks Kylo and avoids him all the time only for the Resistance to escape Krait and by consequence drains Luke Lifeforce and he Dies absorbed by the force like Yoda and Bem! Luke will Return as a Force Ghost in Epi 9 for sure;
Rey: We still dont know who she is or where her force powers come from! I Believe that Kylo lied to her and i think she was made how Anakin was made; The Mind Conection with Kilo Ren was weird like platonic atraction and that was strange to me!Because they are Rivals & Kylo killed Han (a Father figure she like) and yet shes ready to forgive Kylo who is a Psychophat Maniac?? Not Believeble and i still dont know what Disney want from this!? And what a great training she got from Luke Lol
Snoke: Gets Killed by Kylo Ren in the Middle of the movie Wtf! For me this is a Twist! I think hes still alive and is Darth Plagueis; the momment before his death he was feeling Kylo and Rey thoughts it seemed that he was in perfect control; manouvering Rey like a puppet her force powers and kylos were no match! This was a test for Kylo Loyalty! Because if Snoke really died without any answers of who he really is and where he came from this will be the worst Plot i have ever seen!! Why all the mistery in Epi 7 behind Snoke? Scars cuts & being Tall and Thin all matches Plagueis description and Snoke speech is almost identical for the Emperor lines;
Kylo Ren: He didnt learn anything! Proof is Krait were he looses control and orders everyone to shoot Luke and attacks his Projection without any Tactic just Raw anger and blindness! A well trained Jedi with good lightsaber skills would defeat him easy; even the Red Minions in the Throne Room (Maybe Knights of Ren?) were hard to defeat! Hes just a Vader Wannabe with anger management and daddy issues; hes no Leader just a bully with powers! I really prefer him with a Mask on!
Overall i give Epi 8 - The Last Jedi a Score of 6. Please Disney listen to the fans and Give us a EPIC ending!
PS -I hope AngryBirds will kill all the Porgs in Star Wars",6,1,2,17 January 2018
Joker," Downward Spiral
","This movie is depressing, boring and really low paced... And the worse overhyped, because it uses the Gotham, Batman, and Jokers name without any need. And the Political message is not that good, only if the answer you are looking for ia TOTAL BRAINLESS ANARCHY...
Not trying to take the merits of the movie, the acting is quite good, the directing is ok, it is a dark movie with a good Gotham thirties vybe set up, the narrative is well writen, but the soundtrack is just to depressing. I cant even say what type of movie this is, but Phoenix says in the movie a thing that sums it up:
All this time i tought my life was a tragedy, but in the end it is a comedy!
I mean you kind of fell sorry for the joker, but in the end he just got what he deserved. You expect something diferent in the movie, that happens something for the movie to take off, but the self misery never ends.
Well the ending is ok, with a small easter egg.
But it is the truth, you could have made a movie with a regular guy who was not the JOKER, and this movie just wouldnt be as overhyped as it is, and people wouldnt like it as much.
It would be a simple movie, with a maniac phicopath who lives with is mom, and as to take meds because he as a laughing condition. And then he starts to kill people because he is angry about is life being miserable, tired of being mistreated, and also beacause he is sorry about himself.
Joaquim Phoenix does a good job, so does Robert de Niro, but this is never a Oscar winning performance as peolple say. I have seen millions of better performances. And Heath Ledger Joker is a lot better.
What angrys me the most is if this is a origin story for the Villain joker, it is a bad one... Since with this sorry guy, he would never become the dangerous arch-enemy of bruce wayne because simply this guy is a complete idiot, as no brains, is actions are predictible, and he acts on the momment without thinking in consequences. The JOKER was a very clever enemy, sinister and pure evil, not this sick man...
Well comparing this to taxi driver, ia a complete joke. The only thing in commom is that Robert the Nire participates in both movies. Taxi driver, as a downward spiral man as well, but it makes a lot more sense and it is a lot better.
P.S: A advice, see this movie at home, in the movie theater it is a letdown movie, because the movie drags a lot and you will think why you did not stay at home. Hey i wasnt expecting a action movie, but i expecting a good thriller and clearly this is not. I guess the Joker was on me :)",6,1,2,8 October 2019
Parasite," Hopes and Dreams of a Separated Korea
","I saw this Movie just one day after it won 4 Oscars:
Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film.
For me it deserves the Oscar for Best International Movie and best Original Screenplay but the best movie of the Year?? CMON...
This is the most overated movie of the Decade, it is a good movie sure, with a good Critic to society...
Showing the struggle of the classes, the Decay of the Rich who lives their plastic lives, and the Poor that must fight back and rise against opression and Tirany.
The problem with the movie, is that it drags in the first 30 minutes, the screentime should be cut to 1h30, 2 hours and 10 minutes is too long...
The Dark Humour presented here is really good, and the Climax of the movie, starting with the Flood is also Great. But some of the dialogues in the movie are lacking.
The directors work here is really good no doubt, but this movie is after all a Independant Movie with a short budget, with few sets, and some good Twists and Turns in the story...
The actors, like almost every Korean movie i've seen, seem authentic and act like real people so they do a very good job.
This Movie is a Good One, almost an 8 but the ending could have been better.
It is far from a masterpiece, so my review score is a 7 out of 10.
P.S: Loved the Critic to Kim Jong Un Regime, the Menace of the Power of a Button is as Powerfull as a Atomic Bomb LOL",7,5,11,10 February 2020
