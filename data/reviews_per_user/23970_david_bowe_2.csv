Hereditary," This is NOT this generation's Exorcist
","This movie has a couple of unexpected moments that make you jump, but it is a disjointed, unrealistic mess. It staggers implausibly through a storyline that makes little sense, seemingly forgetting that there is such a thing as the police force, reaching a highly confusing conclusion. I spent most of the movie thinking that this is the kind of movie that you need to watch twice - assuming that the ending will make it all make sense. Sadly, no.I recommend that you ignore the hype and avoid this movie. It is pretty terrible.",3,1,4,26 August 2018
Deadpool 2," A worthy sequel
","Sequels can often be disappointing. Deadpool 2 is not disappointing at all. Filled with the same level of violence and gore as the first movie, this action packed comedy superhero movie is the best release of the year that I have seen so far.If you enjoyed the first Deadpool movie, do not hesitate to watch this one.",9,2,3,26 August 2018
