Marie Antoinette," History with a touch of contemporary pop
","Sofia Coppola is a highly underestimated director, in my opinion. She directs this film, like Lost in Translation, with incredible finesse. I'd say she's a better director than her father, but I guess it's an apples and oranges comparison: dad is pretty heavy handed, while S.C. directs with apparent tremendous delicacy. She seems to get the best from her actors, and the creativity of her shot and music selections (tossing some almost incidental contemporaneous references into this period piece) demonstrate an intuition unsurpassed by other current directors in her age group. To this day, Lost in Translation brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it. GO SOPHIA.",8,1,4,29 October 2006
Training Day," Top notch performances by Denzel and Ethan Hawke
","What an exciting and intense film.  Denzel's performance was absolutely top notch -- of course, when is it not?  But, here, he plays such a terrifically believable sociopath that, in the end, you really want to find some redeeming quality in his character.  He definitely gets my vote for best actor of 2001.  Ethan Hawke really holds his own too.  He masterfully displays the development of his rookie character.  Disillusionment sucks! This film starts out edgy and amusing and gets progressively more intense, until you are on the edge of your seat for the last quarter of the movie. Two thumbs up.",10,2,13,14 October 2001
Casino Royale," Best Bond since Sean Connery
","Daniel Craig is everything you want Bond to be: ruggedly handsome, sarcastic, almost always smarter than the bad guy, unbelievably tough (endures a torture scene -- all implied of course -- that makes the women cringe on his behalf), and completely ripped with his shirt off.He brings some of the uncertainty of Sean Connery's early Bond back to the character. Craig's Bond lacks the COMPLETE polish and finesse of other post-Connery Bonds: he makes mistakes AND falls in love. He's human.I will always have a VERY warm place in my heart for Pierce Brosnan (in any part -- not just Bond), by Daniel Craig makes my blood boil.",10,1,3,5 December 2006
