Requiem for a Dream," Fun stuff
","Requiem For A Dream is the scariest movie of all time.  At least it's the most disturbing.  It's very scary to see what happens to the characters. Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, and even Marlon Wayans give chilling performances.  Once you see the movie, you are chilled about the three different stories that you have nightmares for two weeks.  Three stories in a drug movie seems to be a trend now, seeming as Traffic does the same thing.  While Traffic weaves their stories a bit more well, Requiem's is by far alot more harrowing.  This is far more scary then Ellen Burstyn's big hit The Excorcist, which in my opinion, I thought was a hilarious movie. Ellen Burstyn deserves her nomination here, she was better than Roberts, who won.  In fact, this movie deserved nominations for sound, score, editing, cinematography, adapted screenplay, supporting actress(Connely), director(for Aronofsky's brilliant direction) and best picture.  I thought this was by far the second best film of the year, just losing to Traffic. Even though I am child, I wouldn't recommend showing this one to your fifteen year old.  I'm sorry if that's hypocritical.",10,0,0,14 May 2001
Erin Brockovich," Marvelous in all aspects
","Erin Brockovich is a marvelous movie.  Julia Roberts give an astonishing performance.  It is a total change of pace for her, after Notting Hill. Erin Brockovich is one of those few movies that has something for everybody. It has humor, drama, suspense, politics, it has it all.  That what makes this a great film. This one will be a classic in about fifteen years, deservedly so.",9,1,1,12 July 2001
As Good as It Gets," As Good As It Gets
","The title is probably the most spot on title you'll hear.  This movie is as good as it gets.  This movie has flawless performances by Nicholson, Hunt, Kinnear, Knight, and Gooding Jr.  The movie has a script that is so good it rivals scripts like American Beauty.  As Good As It Gets is my second favorite movie of all time, just behind Jerry Maguire.  That doesn't mean that it's the second BEST I've seen, but it certainly was the best film of the year, especially in a tough year.  The Oscars were right on giving Nicholson and Hunt awards, I wish Kinnear had won.  All in all this is a solid 10/10 film with it's charming humor and the times where you just want to hug yourself with delight.  I recommend this to all film lovers.",10,0,0,9 July 2001
American Beauty," Best film I've ever seen
","Jerry Maguire is my favorite, but this is the best movie I have ever seen. This deserves ten stars out of four.  I really think this movie is brilliant.  They should have given an honorary oscar to the cast of this movie, cause there were brilliant performances by all the eight major characters.  Mendes should stick to film if this is the kind of work he can put up time to time.  Everything is just so perfect about this movie.  The dialogue is very, very superior, thanks to Alan Ball. The script is at times sad, hilarious, and suspenseful.  The only film that even comes close to being as good as American Beauty is Kenneth Branagh's version of Hamlet.  If you haven't seen this yet, I only have three words of advice for you.  GO SEE IT!!!!",8,0,0,26 June 2001
American History X," Most powerful film of all time
","Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan were amazingly powerful movies, but neither of them equal up to the power of American History X.  This film made me really think hard about the racism in America.  Some people deny that there is still racism in this country, those people haven't seen American History X.  Edward Norton is a powerhouse in this movie, nobody could have close to pulling this off as well as he did.  Un forunately, he was up against Roberto Benigni for Life Is Beautiful, for the best actor award at the Oscars.  Edward Furlong comes out of nowhere and gives a brilliant performance playing his Norton's confused brother who is caught up in the whole Nazi mess that his brother used to be part of.  In my opinion, this was the best film of the year.  It deserved nominations for sound, score, editing, cinematography, original screenplay, supporting actor (Furlong), director, and the coveted best picture award, which it should have won.",8,0,0,19 May 2001
Pearl Harbor," Definitely not as good as I hoped
","Pearl Harbor is definitely not what I wanted or expected.  Instead of being a movie that was the total favorite for the best picture Oscar next year, we get one of the worst films of the year.  The attack scene is fine, no question.  But the love story is flat out BORING.  I am going to compare this movie to Titanic, because it's like Titanic (Only Titanic was MUCH better.)  Titanic at least has an interesting love story and great chemistry between Dicaprio and Winslet.  Pearl Harbor has Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsale in this love triangle that leaves a viewer totally unsatisfied. The love story is intense in Titanic.  The love triangle in Pearl Harbor is sleep inducing.  The really unfortunate thing about this movie is that it had great potential, I thought, and decided not to use it.  It would have been in much better hands with a director like James Cameron.  Alot of characters are wasted in this movie, because they don't need to be there. As much as I like Cuba Gooding Jr., he is just wasted in this movie, along with Dan Aykroyd, and Alec Baldwin.  The length of this movie totally turned me off.  It's a three hour movie that would have been alot better if it were two hours.  Some historical accuracies left me unsatisfied, especially not getting FDR's December 7, 1941 speech right.  There are only two really good things in this movie.  The attack scene (visually stunning), and Voight's performance as FDR.  Although the speech wasn't correct, Voight sounded just like FDR.  Instead of being a best picture contender, all it's going to contend for is best sound and stuff like that, hopefully.",4,1,1,18 June 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Good, but kind of over rated
","I liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, I would give it ***/ out of ****. But I wouldn't call it  a masterpice like just about every critic.  Sure it was a joy to look at it's beautiful sets, costumes, and choreography. But this movie doesn't have a great story.  I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not the best.  What I don't get is how the critics loved the love story so much.  It's not as bad as Pearl Harbor's, but you don't sense the charisma as you did in Titanic.  All in all a good film, but it's over rated.",10,0,0,11 July 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Extremely brilliant
","Just when I thought Baz Luhrman couldn't make another movie as great as Romeo and Juliet, he makes Moulin Rouge.  Moulin Rouge is easily so far this years best film and movie soundtrack.  The music is what makes this movie. You'll laugh during the Like A Virgin number, cry when Kidman sings One Day I'll Fly Away.  All in all, this is an extremely brilliant film.  I would say this is the best musical of all time.  Not only, musically is it a great movie, but the acting is superb.  Kidman and Broadbent are brilliant, McGregor gives an honest performance, Roxburgh is scary, and Leguizamo was decent.  Kidman and McGregor also have great singing voices.  The rest of the cast have decent voices, (except Roxburgh, but he doesn't sing much.) This should get nominations at the Oscars for best song (a couple of them), makeup, costume, art direction, sound, score, editing, cinematography, original screenplay, supporting actor (Broabent), actress (Kidman), director, and picture( Which I hope it wins)",10,0,1,11 June 2001
Jerry Maguire," My favorite movie of all time
","I don't think Jerry Maguire is the best film of all time, but it's certainly my favorite of all time.  This movie really got me respecting Cruise and his work.  He really gives a top class performance in this movie.  The best part about this movie, however, is Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brilliant, hilarious performance.  He really gets this role down pat.  No body could have done this role better than him.  Zellweger, my favorite actress, is fabulous.  In fact, the whole cast is a marvel.  I also love Cameron Crowe's really witty script.  It is so sharp.  How does it lose to Fargo for best original screenplay?  Don't get me wrong, Fargo was great, but Jerry Maguire was just better.  If only Kenneth Branagh's version of Hamlet wasn't released that year, Jerry Maguire is the best film.",10,3,8,21 June 2001
Gladiator," I am GLAD I saw this one
","When I saw Gladiator, I was reminded of Braveheart.  But you know what? That's actually a really good thing, seeming as I loved Braveheart. Gladiator is good on all scales.  Visually, it is probably the best film of the year.  Story, one of the top five.  Acting, one of the top five. Gladiator leaves on the edge of your seat the whole time.  What's amazing about this is you don't see many action movies that debate between systems of government, and this movie handles it so well.  This is brilliant film making, it just might be better than Braveheart.  So if you liked Braveheart, you'll LOVE this.",8,2,3,11 July 2001
