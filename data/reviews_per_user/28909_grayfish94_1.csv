It," There's nothing to this movie...
","Want to be scared, have a thrill? Perhaps by a clown? Don't watch IT... This movie is probably aimed at a younger audience. There might be some value in this movie for people who have not yet been overexposed to cheap jumpscares and... clowns.1. Pennywise (the clown...) has no backstory. We don't really get a reason why pennywise exist, only clues. Neither do we get a reason as for why kids are disappearing.2. This is the first of 2 parts, something we don't get to know until the very end. So naturally, you won't get any answers in this movie, you'll just have to wait for part 2...Pros: -CGI was pretty good -Probably a good movie to analyze, 'what makes a movie boring'Cons: -Clowns are not scary for just being clowns... -Flat characters -This is the first of two parts, something that isn't stated anywhere except in the end of the movie... -Cheap jumpscares (that were pretty lame...) -the Comic relief is more annoying than fun -The girl is the same age as the boys but is clearly acted out by a much older actor... -The ending sucks (does not really end, nor does it leave me waiting for more...)Don't waste your time with this. This movie won't scare you, give you a thrill or entertain you enough to make it worth it.",4,0,4,1 October 2017
