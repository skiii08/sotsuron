The Blair Witch Project," One of the crappiest movies ever made!!!
","The 'one line summary' pretty much says it but in a little detail, the spend 95 percent of the movie screaming at each other over whose at fault for whatever with a couple night time sequences of them screaming over a couple of faint noises. OOOOOHHHHH!!!  Scary!!!  Oh please!!!  The only scene that was any good (and it wasn't good either because it didn't explain anything) was the last scene.  This movie just wasn't remotely scary or interesting or fun.  It totally blows my mind that anyone liked this movie and that it didn't just flop big time.  The writers and makers should be thrown in jail for such a travesty of movie justice.  Oh well, to each his/her own of course.",1,0,3,4 September 1999
The 13th Warrior," Good movie but....
","This was good movie.  The acting was good by all.  The trailer, though; kind of made the movie out to be a little on the super natural side (which is one of my favorite genres) which it turned out not to be.  Plus there wasn't enough action and a couple of slow spots.  None the less it was a good flick that could have been a little better overall.  With the good acting and some action and a couple of minor (near) nail biting scenes, it is worth seeing.",7,0,0,4 September 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Not bad but not great either
","I had high hopes for this film but I was a bit let down.  The story is great and so is the acting.  In fact if it weren't for Johnny Depp's excellently done character then I wouldn't even recommend the movie at all.  The biggest problem (and it's a big one indeed) is that this movie is really slow in spots.  If they would cut it down at least 30 minutes then it would have been better.  Too many spots where it just dragged on and on.
The fight sequences are good but too few.  Over all I basically enjoyed the film but not like I had hoped.  Personally I think League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was better.  This movie is worth seeing though it just could have been better.  But you'll LOVE Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow. :)",6,0,1,14 July 2003
The Mummy," A real 10. EXCELLENT!!!! :)
","This movie is quite perfect.  Excellent acting; excellent story, excellent special effects (real eye candy), and excellent humor.  This could easily be identified as an Indiana Jones(esque) movie.  Tons of action, excellent humor, spots that make you jump.  This movie is a tour-de-force.  It's one action moment after another from beginning to end; with just enough calm spots to let you catch your breath for the next sequence.  GO SEE THIS FILM!!!  Oh, and by the way, did I mention it a REALLY good film? :)",10,0,0,9 May 1999
Scary Movie 2," What a disappointment. Don't bother with this one.
","I'm a movie nut and like just about everything so it takes a lot for me to not like a movie.  But SCARY MOVIE 2 achieves that.  This is very unfortunate because the first one was so good.  There are some humorous moments in 2 but overall the ball was dropped and never recovered.  After watching this film, I basically feel they must have thought to themselves, 'Gee, the first one did so well we could just throw this one together and toss it out there and it will do well just on the merits of the first one.'  And based on the first weekend gross that maybe what happens.  It basically felt like the just threw the movie together without any real thought for the script at all.  I don't they think they gave any real attention to detail, writing or anything.  This is very sad because one of the best types of film genres there is, is parody.  Look at the NAKED GUN films.  The original SCARY MOVIE was excellent but number 2 just tanks. 
Strangely enough, I hope they do a number 3 because I think there is so much good material to use but I hope they decide to give it some time and thought and try to actually make it good instead of just tossing something out there for a quick buck.  Based on the $35mil it made on it's opening weekend (and I expect a fairly low budget), I'm sure this one will make money but I'd be willing to bet that it won't come close to the first when all is said and done.  After a big opening weekend and, I expect, a mediocre second weekend, I am expecting this one to drop out of site and go to video quickly. 
Personally, I feel that if you haven't already seen it, then don't bother. If you really feel you must see this one, then wait until it comes out to rent.  Or better yet wait until it's on HBO or Showtime (or whoever ends up with it).  But if you can at all go without it, then don't even both with it when it comes out on video.  It's just not worth it.  :(",3,0,1,10 July 2001
The Transporter," Decent first try.
","This film was fun.  I get the feeling that it is a first try at action films for whoever was the director (I don't know that thought).  Maybe a first film altogether.  At any rate it seems like a new film for several of the actors also.  It was pretty well done and the acting is decent.  The effects weren't exactly top notch but decent.  The plot and overall story were very good.  I think that if the director of this film keeps doing action films that we can expect good things in the long run.  While this film won't win any awards, it was still fun and worth seeing.",7,0,0,20 October 2002
Meet Joe Black," As near to perfect as they get!!!!
","This movie comes as close to perfect as can possibly be done.  The acting was perfect by all.  The storyline was great and a nice mix of emotions evinced by it.  Some humor, some seriousness but no sadness.  I kept envisioning one ending but ended up with another.  Mind you the actual ending was what it should be but I kept thinking it would be different.  But as it turns out the ending was perfect and I wouldn't change anything......Well that's not exactly true but I won't say what because I don't want to spoil it.  Anyway, I suggest everyone see this movie.  I think you'll find it to be one of the best of the year if not ever.  :) Enjoy.",10,0,0,19 November 1998
Mission: Impossible II," What a great film!!!!
","This movie was the best.  Granted you must remember 'suspension of disbelief.'  I and four friends went to see it on Sun. and we all walked out loving it.  The critics didn't appear to like it.  That right there is a good indication that it will be good.  Critics never know what they're talking about anyway.  :) I recommend the movie to everyone.  It was exciting, suspenseful, action filled.  It was a nail biter.  Go see it and enjoy.",10,4,8,30 May 2000
The Mummy Returns," Wonderful!!
","I really liked this film.  While it didn't have quite the edge the first one had, it was every bit as fun with plenty of silly humor and of course grand special effects to go with it.  I hope they make another film with the same actors.  Maybe a different story but another.  This could be another franchise like Indiana Jones.  :)",10,0,0,21 May 2001
La La Land," I so wanted to love this.
","I went in expecting something wonderful like Chicago, or Moulin Rouge, but instead was treated to mediocre at best. The acting was good, the sound was OK, but there was nothing 'best' about it. I don't know how it was able to garner ANY Oscar nominations. There just wasn't anything Oscar worthy about it. It was trying to had to hearken back to the days of Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers and failed miserably. The singing wasn't that great either. I like both of the star actors, but this just wasn't the right vehicle for them. Their singing was just OK. The songs were nothing memorable that I would want the sound track for. The only really good song was the one sung by John Legend. The City of Stars was a nice little ditty, but that about it. The whole movie from beginning to end was just underwhelming. Both my partner and I felt the same way walking out. In fact, his first words were, 'Well that's four hours we'll never get back.' I said, 'It was only two hours.' He said, 'EXACTLY.' Oh well, I guess you can't like everything.",1,16,27,28 January 2017
Eyes Wide Shut," Eyes Shut. And that about says it.
","Well I can't say that I'm a major Kubric fan overall anyway but he does have a couple of good ones out there so I had hopes for this.  Unfortunately this movie lives up to pretty much nothing.  Not even what the trailer makes it out to be.  Which for me was a type of sexual thriller.  NOT!!!!  For about the first near hour the it's just totally boring.  But then something interesting starts and for the next hour and a half your strung along by your nose expecting something grand to happen.  He feeds you little tidbits just to keep you on the edge of interest and then ends the movie with a great big nothing.  A total dud.  I don't even think this movie had any reason to be made.  Other than 'basically' good acting done by Kidman and Cruise, this movie doesn't stand out in any way.  And even their acting wasn't anything to talk about.  I know they are both excellent actors so I can only attribute their performance to both a poorly written script and somewhat tired directing.  I know that Kubric has done some good movies like THE SHINING and 2001 so I can only think that maybe it was his overall health that lead to this unfortunate travesty of a film.  And after seeing the film, it boggles the mind that it took three years to make.  I even heard on entertainment shows on t.v. that this was one of the most grueling films for Tom and Nichole to make and the it took a toll on them and wore them out.  If that's true, there is only one question to ask; Why!?  What was tuff out this movie.  There is no action; no stunts that either had to do, and as for emotionally, well, there wasn't anything emotional about it either.  So again I ask why.  Maybe it was just the demanding nature of Kubric or something.  Anyway, honestly, I wouldn't bother going to see this film if you haven't already.  It's not a thriller to keep you on the edge of your seat;  It's not an intriguing story for you to try to figure out(although it does keep you guessing just a little in one part, but not enough to warrant any kudos); and it's not a love story for you to cry about or be happy over.  Basically there just wasn't any reason for this movie to be made or any compelling reason for anyone to see it.  It disappoints on all levels.  Save your money for THE HAUNTING next week instead.",2,0,0,18 July 1999
Shrek," Loads of fun!
",This film was sooo much fun.  I laughed my ars off.  :)  Great acting and great humor.  You could tell the actors were having lots of fun with this one and the makers weren't trying to make it into something it wasn't. Mainly for older teens and adults this film a little bit for everyone at least ten or older but fits better with fifteen or older.  There are some cute characters for younger kids but the humor is definitely over their heads.  Go see this film and enjoy.  :),10,0,1,21 May 2001
Vanilla Sky," A bizzar story.
",I really can't recommend this movie.  It's way too bizzaro and kind of disjointed.  In a way it's kind of Kubric-esque (that's not necessarily a good thing).  Ultimately it gets explained (and that's all I'll say about that) but that's not enough to really redeem it.  The acting was superb and I think the directing was also good but I think the script left much to be desired.  At least as they decided to film it anyway.  It does have it's moments but not enough to help.  If you must go see it then do it on a matinee or wait until it's on pay per view or rental.,1,0,2,14 December 2001
The Sixth Sense," Excellent flick with a twist
",I won't give the twist away but this movie is more than it's trailers make it out to be.  I suggest it to every one.  The acting and story are great and believable.  Bruce Willis does an excellent job and Haley Joel Osment does a perfect job for his role as well.  I don't feel there really is a way to talk much about this movie without giving away the end so just take my advice and go see it.  It's well worth it.,10,0,0,8 August 1999
