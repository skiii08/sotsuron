Skyfall," Bond stripped back the way Flemming may have wanted him
","This is Bond as he's never been seen before. I had to see Skyfall twice to be sure that I liked the way that the movie sets up Bond for the present and the future.Ian Fleming always wrote Bond as an agent who gets out there and gets the job done by any means possible, with no gadgets just brawn and a dogged determination to complete orders. The trio of writers behind this story have done a fantastic job of stripping back Bond to his base elements and showing him as Mr Fleming once did in his novels, as was done with the first Bond movie to feature Daniel Craig.Skyfall is a very good story married to some excellent direction. There are a couple of tacky moments that I would prefer not to have included but they do not deter from the overall experience.Can't wait for the next installment.",9,2,9,26 December 2012
The Conjuring 2," Underwhleming and predictable
","I had high expectations of the movie having read the reviews despite having reservations after watching the first instalment. My expectations were not met, there was no scare factor or suspense in the movie, my wife only got one shock throughout and she loves a good horror. It may be that I am now completely desensitised to the new horrors that the movie industry has to offer but I feel that my time and money was wasted on this release. The acting was fine, nothing special offered by the cast although Wilson stood out in his role as Ed.",3,5,8,25 June 2016
Mama," An amazingly fresh idea
","Initially I was not too enamored with the plot line but interested enough to give the movie a shot. So many horror movies have promised much and delivered little to the point that I have given up on watching a movie that entertains and surprises me. Whilst Evil Dead served up bloody gore with a reasonable storyline and some really good acting, Mama has finally delivered what all other movies have promised. I'm not one for writing spoilers so rest assured that this review won't have any.Mama delivers some good shocks, moments where you'll be telling the actors 'not to go in there' plus a very unique and interesting twist that I have not witnessed in any other movie. It is this twist that makes the movie stand out from its peers and has encouraged me to endorse this movie for others to watch and to make their own decision.This movie takes the ghost movie genre to a different level that once repeated will immediately lose it's appeal, and as such has made it's mark on me.I hope that you enjoy this feature for the originality it offers.",9,1,2,2 September 2013
Black Panther," Where were the actual Africans in the movie?
","Lead actors studying at the Yale School of Drama or coming from London England, that would explain the really bad accents and the poor portrayal. There were times when the leader of the Gorilla tribe sounded like Bane from Batman Dark Knight Rises.
Aside from the poor accents the story dragged in places and rushed through others so left an incomplete story. Martin Freeman looked totally out of place as a CIA pilot ace and if nothing else it demonstrated that when the Americans arrived the shit hit the fan. Really poor movie that could have been done so much better. I had high hopes for this one.",3,0,2,5 May 2018
Cloud Atlas," Outstanding fantasy with a big pinch of Sci-Fi
","I have read a lot about the confusion that lies within this movie but I was left in awe of this film and certainly far from puzzled.5 mini titles all rolled into one main feature is not easy to pull off but the writers and directors managed it to great effect.The film is helped along massively by the outstanding performances from all of the main characters. It was very interesting to see Tom Hanks get involved in so many variations of character and Halle Berry cracked every role she was given.I'm certainly not going to leave out the rest of the cast as the 2 Jim's (Broadbent and Sturgess) were amazing and Doona Bae was simply captivating.Ben Whisshaw and James D'Arcy played their love story sublimely and Susan Sarandon looked absolutely gorgeous whilst delivering some unforgettable moments.An amazing collection of stories melded together to make a veritable work of cinema art, it's not often that true gem's like this are committed to film. Breath taking.",9,4,8,30 December 2012
