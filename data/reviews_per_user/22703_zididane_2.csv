The Hangover," Terrible, Terrible, Terrible movie, the fact that it is a phenomenon is just depressing.
","This movie was terrible, to put it simply. To look at it more thoroughly read on.Character: There was almost no character development in the movie, one character learns any kind of lesson at all, other than that everyone is the same character at the end of the movie as they were at the beginning. And while I'm looking at the characters let's do some summaries, we have the smug asshole, the beyond idiotic weirdo, the angry nerd, and the uninteresting groom, who also has an uninteresting bride, who by the way has like four lines in the movie.Plot: The idea of forgetting what happened in the night time and trying to put all the pieces together in the morning, yeah it's clever. The problem is, the movie was so short, every problem they encountered had to either resolve it's self, or they solved it so quickly it wasn't really even a problem to begin with. Mike Tyson comes and claims the tiger, then they drive it back, fascinating, really I'm enthralled. They see the hospital bracelet and the Las Vegas doctor remembers everything that four drunk guys said earlier that night, not only that he leads them to there next clue right away. Maybe the doctor could have magically just told them where there friend was. And those aren't even the worst parts.Dialogue: I hardly feel like touching this but let's go. The nerd, all he does is get abused, and then start yelling, then people laugh. Ha ha ha, nerds yelling, ha ha ha. The weird dumb guy, insert non sequitur here, that's pretty much every line in the movie. The Pretty boy who's a dick, well he's just mean and for no real reason, and as for the uninteresting groom, well he only has like four lines, and they aren't very good.In conclusion, I wish I could rate this movie zero, who ever programs this website might want to get started on that.",1,196,378,10 July 2009
The Simpsons Movie," The Worse movie I have ever had the misfortune of paying for
","I walked into this show a dedicated follower of the Simpson's's with a friend and fellow follower. Both of us grew up with the show during it's prime and have been watching the slow decline in quality with grave disappointment. That being said we were both willing to take a chance on the movie, paying full admission price to see it at a theater. Our logic was that being as this was a big event with a lot of hype, the producers and writers would demand the best of themselves, and due something, perhaps not stylistically identical to but in terms of quality, at least on par with the Simpson's's during there 1999-2001 era, not it's finest for sure but surely it could be a lot worst. I was wrong.Through out the entire movie, I did not laugh one time, and this was in a movie theater, the atmosphere of which alone has made sub-par movies the subject of giddy laughs for decades. And yet the best it got out of me was a mere chuckle. Most of the jokes were in fact so bad that I could do nothing more than look over at my friend to find that we were both cringing with embarrassment at having payed for this atrocity. When the movie ended and we left the theater in a crowd of what turned out to be mostly five year olds who didn't know any better, and there equally naive parents, I contemplated the idea of demanding my money back for such a terrible film, however that bore one consequence that I could never live down. I'd have to admit face to face to the vendor that I had actually watched it.",1,4,7,7 June 2009
