First Man," not worth anyones time
","Acting is good , the movie is not .
the film is taking place in 4 different rooms .minimum out takes . and i think that we did not see anyone in full body (just 4 quick shots maybe ) . waist up and close up .
if we were watching it at home , we would not have watched it to the end .",2,0,1,25 October 2018
The Matrix," a must see
","An epic journey relevant to this day.
you need to relax dim the lights and pay attention .
excellent work across the board . Perfect !!!",10,1,1,22 October 2018
