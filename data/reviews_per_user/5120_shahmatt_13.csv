50 First Dates," Funny, Original and requires an average EQ to deal with.
","The movie was really funny. Some of the jokes were hilarious. The concept was innovative and original. Well acted out by Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore (In fact, it was the best piece of acting I've seen by Sandler yet. Apparently he has talent). Barrymore was as usual superb. The only part I didn't like about the movie was that it ended on a slightly sad tone. It was a 'feel good' movie.. and yet not a 'feel good' movie... I don't like it when they mix up emotions that way.Anyway, a great show. Recommended for all. Rating (7/10).",8,0,0,1 May 2004
Finding Neverland," The type of movie that's good...but not That good
","I've always been rather skeptical about the Peter Pan fable. Peter Pan isn't really a children's story. It's downright horrifying. The original tale talks of a boy, living in a world of his own, never being able to grow up. A boy who went to Neverland so long ago that he can't remember who his parents were. And, in his innocence, drags other children along with him. I imagine how their parents must feel, and I always think, what a tragedy, and what an excuse for happiness? Anyway, Finding Neverland comes packaged with some stellar acting performances by Depp and Winslet, and the children were spot on. But I am at a loss in trying to classify this movie. Does it talk about hope? about the power of imagination? about love? It doesn't seem to have a focus. Just a story that's nowhere really in the end...but that's just my opinion....Do have a look and form your opinion about it....A truly unusual film",7,0,0,18 July 2005
Kung Fu Panda," Kung Fu Panda is a good movie
","I must admit I was a little skeptical going in to watch this movie, the main reason being, Dreamworks, in my opinion, has not produced a good movie since Shrek. By good movie I mean, a movie with a good story, heart, and humor. The Shrek sequels and other movies from the studio have all been corny and shallow, utilizing big name voices but with little in the manner of storyline and heart. Pixar, did exactly the opposite. Avoiding big names as much as they could except for where they felt it was necessary to help the storyline. Pixar put movie first, then voice actors. Dreamworks the reverse. And look at which company does better. Pixar of course! A good friend told me that Kung Fu Panda was 'friggin Awesome', so I decided to take a chance. The trailers looked interesting. A little different from Dreamworks' typical approach of touting voices and funny scenes. Kung Fu Panda does have its fair share of voices, with Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, and Dustin Hoffman. But the trailers did not focus on the voices at all, which led me to believe that this might be something new.So it started. I was mesmerized by the stylized opening sequence. I'm sure many an animator would take note of the work. It left me intrigued and interested. It also got me to smile and set me up for what was to come. The opening sequence is important. Make sure you don't get late and miss it.The movie then switches into the normal style of 3D animation that we have become so familiar with in recent years. Kung Fu Panda has a lot of talking animals in it, and no humans at all. Jack Black plays Po, the Panda, who works in a noodle shop assisting his father (a goose?). He dreams of learning Kung Fu, and is a big fan of the fearsome five, a group of five animals who are experts within their animal talents. He is a true fan boy, and owns action figures of each of them. The story unfolds in a way that is not too unexpected. Po, our unlikely lovable hero, has to eventually defeat Tai Lung, and save everyone.Interestingly, I found that the style of story had some similarities to Chinese folklore. The storyline intentionally encompasses Chinese culture and tradition to a degree. A rare thing to behold. I loved the effort.Kung Fu Panda will appeal to all ages. For the young, the motivational message that comes towards the end. And for the older, an enchanting work of great entertainment. I was entertained.Kung Fu Panda is a good movie, and is reminiscent of the days when Dreamworks came up with Shrek. Now go see it and enjoy yourself!",9,4,5,19 June 2008
Home Alone," They make too few movies like this
","I loved this movie for its originality, style, atmosphere, feel good ending, humour...well...and a whole lot more other stuff. I don't care if it wasn't very realistic. I think realism is a let down. When I go to the movies I wanna see something that makes me feel good and inspired maybe. Movies are entertainment aren't they? Home Alone is an ENTERTAINING movie. And in this time where family breakups and divorces are rampant, this movie is a refreshing look on what families are all about, and its importance (though it was made more than a decade ago).Because this kind of 'feel good' movie is so rare, I rate it 9/10.",9,0,1,30 May 2004
Cars 2," Good movie, but not special like its predecessors!
","Cars 2 is a fun movie to watch. As we have all come to expect from Pixar the movie is visually stunning. The modeling of cities like London, Paris, Italy etc. are not only rich in detail but hilariously modified to fit in with the anthropomorphic Cars theme. Pixar's creation of this car world is highly intelligent and I was thoroughly amused.The plot involves a lot of action, humor and generally good entertainment but adopts a more conventional mainstream action/mystery/adventure form. I suppose it has detracted a little from the usual Pixar method, which is to get the viewer emotionally engaged. The emotional engagement made Pixar's work special and Cars 2 is not really as special as Pixar's previous work.But there is no doubt that Cars 2 is entertaining. Ratings are a relative scale, and the rating for Cars 2 is only low because we've come to expect so much from Pixar. Any let down therefore is a severe blow. This movie would have no doubt been rated higher had it perhaps been directed by, say for example, Mr. Michael Bay.",7,1,3,15 October 2011
Transformers," Too much action. Misplaced sound. Unconvincing characters.
","There's something wrong with Transformers. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'll try my best to explain how I felt as the movie went from start to finish, and perhaps you, the reader out there, can figure out what I mean.The movie started off well enough, lots of mystery and suspense, the character development of the many heroes were all right. Some relatively funny lines. So far so good.Now comes the body. A bit confusing. What is the focus here? We are introduced to good guys, who behave so much like bad guys you immediately assume villain! villain! whack the SOB! Then the finale. A very long drawn out action sequence, overwhelming the senses and numbing them. So much destruction and carnage goes on that it is impossible that our heroes continue to stand without even a scratch on them. I kept watching and waiting. Look, there's an entire building made of concrete destroyed by a transformer, our hero is in its midst, surely a splinter would pierce his foot, surely he'd get whacked on the head and go unconscious, or at least get stunned. But no, he still has smooth skin, its a miracle. This happens over and over and over again, until I grew quite tired of it.I am also amused by the sudden dependence on this unlikely hero. His task could have easily been carried out, with much greater efficiency, by a transformer. All the while I thought, plot hole, BIG plot hole.Many of the characters are very unconvincing. We have senior army personnel acting like children.Music direction was very VERY poor. Too many times, epic-like music was played at relatively unimportant points. You immediately assume something significant is about to happen, but you end up disappointed.If you are a devoted Transformers fan, please do go for this movie. The transformers are beautifully rendered and remind me so much of the cartoon when I was a kid. This movie will please fans. If, on the other hand, you want to be entertained by a 'good' action movie, you might be disappointed. I know I was.",5,5,11,2 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Unusually high rating in IMDb.. NOT the book fans I'm sure
","The movie was a disappointment. I understand that the book is far too long to incorporate into a movie but, I hoped that what little they picked out from the book they could have tried getting it right. The headmaster Dumbledore was completely out of character behaving more like a angry old man rather than a calm and wise old wizard. Voldermort turned out to be a joke with his rock singer like antics. They got the 'slit-like' noses, and the 'high pitched' voice though. But he looked anything like the most evil wizard of all. Who picked these guys to act anyway? As for the plot, there were some agonizing moments in the movie such as the quidditch games which started, and then never ended. Sort of a clear message to the viewers saying: 'Sorry folks we've got to finish up this movie and we can't put in everything. Moving on to other things in brief....'. Well I'm sorry, but the show length was 157 mins long. That's still less than 3 hours, and if you include a scene at LEAST complete it. Pretty bad work Mr. Director.Some of the major characters were left out. Such as Molly Weasley and the House Elf (whatziznameagain?). Time wasn't an excuse.... bad job...really bad job...The underwater scenery was good, and so was the dragon chase (but it was highly exaggerated) AND.. a NEEDLESS waste of that precious commodity, time...Harry Potter book fans will be disappointed...I think the movies are targeting the fans who haven't read the book. How disgusting.",5,0,0,10 December 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," An astonishing tale of endurance, courage, life, and perspective..
","At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.",10,7,10,25 October 2007
Back to the Future Part II," A good 'middle' movie
","Anybody who watches Back to the Future must see all three movies at once. Or at least within a short timespan. Watching Back to the future II without knowing how the story began is disastrous and a waste of a good movie. So some advice to those who haven't seen this movie yet: DON'T WATCH TILL YOU'VE SEEN PART I.Anyway, from a purely critical point of view this movie did tend to be a shade bit tedious. But I think that this was somewhat of a plus point because when you are bored you can sort out things in your head. And the concept did need some sorting out.I guess that's all. Keep in mind that this film was released in 1989. So things are definitely weird when looking at the future from that point in time. It's rather funny really.",10,1,2,7 February 2004
Casino Royale," Not the bond I want to see
","There have been a lot of mixed reviews about this film. Some have said that Daniel Craig could be likened with Sean Connery, with his cold edged approach. That's perhaps true, to an extent. Daniel Craig does exhibit a certain coldness, and he does have the charisma, but he did not show the quick wit Connery became known for. I disagree with Daniel Craig as the new Bond, and I disagree with the new style they've made for the Bond franchise.Casino Royale is an old fashioned movie. It could have been filmed in the 60's or 70's as there was hardly anything modern about it. A woeful sprinkling of gadgets, and computers, which I think was done deliberately, in order to focus the movie on the characters, rather than the environment. This might have worked if Daniel Craig was a better actor, but he's not. He shows almost no emotion throughout the entire movie, almost as if his face was incapable of changing into a genuine smile. Perhaps he was asked to act that way, if so, it was a mistake. Bond was never really supposed to be emotionless, cold perhaps, but he did smile, and act human, which is why he was such a great spy: he acted natural. Daniel Craig could have been a robot, and his manner screamed I'm up to no good. And added by the fact that whatever he said was more of a mumble than actual words, it was dreadful that women sort of gravitated towards him. Correct me if i'm wrong, but even though Bond is supposed to be good looking, didn't personality do something to attract those stunning bond girls? Craig doesn't have much in terms of dialog either, I suppose 90% of what he said could be found in IMDb's movie quotes. In short, the new Bond lacks character, wit, and charm. To his credit, he has the build, and looks silly when running (which was something I found to console myself by as the movie progressed).I disagree with the style of the movie. Why did the Bond franchise have to go back in time? I mean, this is the 21st century, we could afford to see a few more gadgets in the Bond franchise. Brosnan's lot was chockful of delicious gadgets that were entertaining and interesting, and breached into the modern era. Why couldn't this Bond have some of that? This backward thinking is boring. I also noticed that the chase scenes were far too long. The first one was interesting, the chap running away looked almost inhuman with his escape tactics. All right, that was fun, move on to something else that's interesting, but no, they came up with another chase sequence, and another later on, which dragged painfully. It wasn't just the action, even the romance was overly extended, and with a minimum of conversation too, it was too quiet. Eva Green is gorgeous, but she's on display so much that it becomes tiresome, and by the end of it I wished she would just go away. The ending was somewhat clichÃ© as well. You'll see, the penultimate scene brings so much peace and serenity that had absolutely NO business belonging in a Bond movie. You knew about the impending disaster, you could feel it coming, it was boring.When I watch a Bond movie, I expect to be entertained in some way. Bond, obviously, has to carry most of the burden by exhibiting something about a special man. Charm?, wit? (NIL), dialogue (very little). Good story? (Possibly, but still underdeveloped). Gadgets? (forget it), Humor (NIL). A future for a new Bond? I hope not.Casino Royale is empty, of everything. Go watch it if you have to know what Bond should NOT have become.",5,2,4,27 November 2006
The Truman Show," A superb movie. But why is it a comedy?
","I was just wondering why people think this movie is a comedy. I thought it was scary, sad, and incredibly compelling. Reminded me of the Matrix, where the people really didn't know that the real world is out there.
I think that the most terrifying thing would be if this concept was true. That the world is a stage and we are its actors. If it was true how would we know? Are we really just a part of a grand tv show to some superior being? Don't certain religions teach something like that?This movie gets an 8/10 because it got me thinking. It made me see that life is just a bloody play act anyway. We act everything anyway don't we? We go to work.. and Act there....We go home to our families... and Act there.... We say our prayers...and Act again ... is nothing Real? Even Love... doesn't it turn into an act after a while?!?!?Darn it folks! I'm off to find myself some reality...I wish all actors a Good Afternoon, Good Evening and a Good Night!!!",8,0,0,13 April 2004
V for Vendetta," Well worth the time and money
","When I walked into the cinema to watch V for Vendetta I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. The trailer was rather vague, and the posters kept pushing forth the words 'from the directors of the Matrix'. Anyway, I took the chance, spent the 8.50 to check it out, and that was the best 8.50 i've spent on a movie in a long long while.From the word 'go' the movie grips you with its tone and lighting. Dark corridors and stylish camera work. Enter 'V' (Hugo Weaving), with his crisp language and eloquent introduction full of V's in it, and you are gripped by his charisma and manner. Hugo Weavings pulls off a marvelous feat with bringing V to life, especially since V is totally masked with an expressionless face throughout. We relate to him, we sympathize with him, and we wonder about him. A wonderful job. He deserves an Oscar for the effort.Along with Natalie Portman (whose English accent is sometimes a bit funny, but worked nevertheless), V attempts revolution against a government not unlike what is portrayed in George Orwell's famous novel '1984'. We follow through his plan, the ups and downs, and his hope for a future. A classical example of a true revolutionary seeking transparency and justice.Aside from the fact that V for Vendetta is a great movie having the usual features of good movies in abundance, viz: excellent acting, great story, stylish presentation, perfect ending, I think the point it brings across is far more valuable to our very complacent modern society than the movie itself. I highly recommend it 10/10.",10,1,3,22 October 2006
The Island," A scary view at what the near future might behold
","In today's world, men argue over whether stem cell research is ethical, and a fair population i'm sure are supportive of the idea, or else it wouldn't even reach the news. In the same way, human cloning is a concept scientists seem to play around with for longer periods of time than I would say I'm comfortable with.Someday stem cell research will be used to grow human organs, and human clones will indeed populate the earth. These ideas will be made possible by the people in power, who as we see right now, can't draw the line between what is ethical and what is not.Given the way the modern world works right now, its not far fetched to imagine that the concept behind 'The Island' could one day be a reality.My vote: 9/10...for realism, entertainment, and making me think..Watch it....",9,0,0,7 September 2006
