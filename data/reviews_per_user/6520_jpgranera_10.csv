Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Funny, family friendly and really entertaining
","This is a classic. The best film in my opinion using both live action actors and 2D cartoons. It is very appealing and has a lot of good jokes. You will have a good time watching it, better with kids.",7,2,2,8 January 2019
Akira," A little overrated in my opinion
","I wanted to like this movie so bad. I heard a lot of great comments by friends about this movie, they built to much hype that I expected way more. It went to a whole different direction from what I thought. The poster looks really cool and I thought it would be about motorcycles, but then I watched and was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the animation is really good, the colors and the idea, but the movie had much more potential. The characters are not very appealing and their expressions are awkward at times. Maybe I would like it more if I had watched it as a kid.",7,1,1,8 January 2019
Bird Box," This was a regular movie
","Not great, not bad, just regular. It does entertain, especially at the start. The movie had so much potential but it just started to fall down as the minutes went by. Lots of questions. The idea of the antagonist was not really well defined, they could do some crazy monsters or even zombies would be better I suppose. That ending is what will make people just forget about the movie days after watching it, nothing very intelligent. But if you want to watch it go ahead, it is enjoyable at times.",7,1,3,5 January 2019
Spirited Away," An exciting journey
","First anime experience, and I really liked it. The directing was done perfectly, as well as the animation, beautiful colors and backgrounds, and an interesting story. The first 15 minutes are my favorite, the built is really great. Also the music is awesome, one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. On the other side, I don't really like some secondary characters design, and at times I felt the story a little slow. But I definetly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch something different to the Disney classics. This movie teaches a lot more than them and it's appropiate to people all ages.",8,1,1,8 January 2019
Toy Story," Old but gold
","Simply a masterpiece. When the Pixar Studio and John Lasseter decided to do the first animated film, they would never do a film just as an 'experiment', nor make it fast and neglect the story and the technical things. They worked for years to deliver to the world a new way to make films and a wonderful story that is appealing for people all ages. The dialogues are great and funny, every single character has a defined personality, itÂ´s perfect technically speaking and lives to date, helping as a standard for new animated movies.",9,0,0,8 January 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternal waste of your valuable time (2004)
","I did not have a good time with this one. Watched it with my family and we all thought at the middle of the movie everything had to be a joke, but sadly it wasn't. I am surprised at how great critiques this movie has had. I watched it only because I saw it in a Top.40 movie list on the internet, aside from that, I never heard about this movie in my life. Not everything was that bad, I will say, it had short good moments but in general, the movie intended to innovate a way of telling a story, but it was just an experiment, nothing more. I don't quite recommend it, only if you want to experience it by yourself.",6,3,6,4 January 2019
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Snow White, and the Seven Stars
","Great job for the first animated film! A huge success, it´s a classic. The movie lives to date, children can watch it nowadays and don´t even notice how old it is. It is technically a masterpiece considering when it was done; the music and soundtrack are just on point, the colors are accurate and the animation really good. What it lacks is a sense in the plot, as most of the classics of Disney. Also for me, Snow White isn't a very relatable character. But I do recommend it because is a film everyone should watch at least once, the dwarfs are so much fun!",7,0,0,6 January 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Best prison movie of all time!
","It is a movie that catches your attention from start to end. Besides the great storytelling, what I most love about this one is the great cast with strong performances and the fact that the main character is indeed intelligent. He is very smart along the movie, so clever most of us didnÂ´t see his plan coming. Every character in the film has a very defined personality and adds to the plot. The ending is great.",10,0,0,2 January 2019
The Iron Giant," Had giant expectations, but still pretty good
","From the great director Brad Bird, The Iron Giant it's a good family-friendly movie. It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds 'someone' that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English? But I think that the movie let that to the audience to think.
I recommend this movie to a family with kids, you will enjoy it for sure!",8,1,2,2 January 2019
The Godfather," Oh my Godfather!
","I don't know how I had not watched this film until just a week ago, but I'm glad because this is not a movie to watch with distractions or when you are too young because you will not enjoy it as much as an adult does. I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn't enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth. You will want even more.
If you haven't watch it, what are you waiting for? ('This is an offer you can't refuse')",10,1,1,4 January 2019
