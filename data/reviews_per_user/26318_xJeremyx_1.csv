The Blair Witch Project," Who reads these summaries anyway?
","So I saw the movie today.  Still thinking about it...  The Exorcist wasn't that scary it was more shocking and gross.  And the thing about the Shining is that Jack Nicholson can't not look scary so it wasn't all that great. This movie was scary, what's up with all the people thinking that the movie's to shaky?  It didn't bother me.  I think I could make a scarier movie, but until then this is the scariest.",Null,0,1,5 August 1999
