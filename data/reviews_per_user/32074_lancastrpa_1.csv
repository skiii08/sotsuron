The Blair Witch Project," Greatest Horror Ever Filmed, Bar None!
","I've seen every major horror movie to date, BWP was perfectly filmed, written, directed and produced. Impressive story, you become a part of the movie and scares the hell out of you. I'm leary to watch it any more and nothing scares me. Really would love to know what happened and the noises? AWESOME ***** FILM! Nothing will ever beat it for best horror. It competed and defeated Texas Chainsaw Massacare for my 'Best' horror ever.",9,1,2,2 November 2000
