The Blair Witch Project," Is this the movie I've been waiting all summer for?
","Don't believe the hype. The Blair Witch Project was clever, I have to give it that, but there were just entirely too many cinematic screw-ups for me to give it anything more than a 6.  The filmmakers were so caught up in making this seem like authentic footage they went so far as to disregard the importance of decent sound...I might have been creeped out if I could actually make out some of the dialogue and the actors weren't hyperventilating over each other's lines.And what was up with that ending? Can we say anticlimactic?",6,1,4,19 July 1999
The Mummy," It was so-so
","I've never talked during a movie in my life.  Never. Not once. But my friends and I talked all the way through THE MUMMY - we commented on the mummy, the visible cameras in the shots, and added lines to the movie that would have made it more interesting - anything to keep us from falling asleep.I didn't expect THE MUMMY to be high cinema, but I at least expected it to be interesting and a little chemistry between the two leads would have been a nice touch, but THE MUMMY failed on both accounts.",6,0,0,30 June 1999
American History X," Mediocre..
","Powerful? Outstanding? Moving? Superb? Um...no! I just saw American History X and quite frankly, I didn't know a movie could be disturbing and boring at the same time. The overall plot as well as Ed Norton's character arc was ridiculous. 'Um, hi, I'm a racist.  I cold-bloodedly kill Black kids for trying to steal my car. Ooops, I got raped in the shower, I work next to a Black guy in jail, now I'm not a racist anymore.' Oh, okay.  If we're supposed to believe that it's his friendship in jail that changes his mind about Black people, the relationship needs to go a little deeper than sex jokes and basketball (especially since racists believe that all Black people are interested in is sex and basketball.) Then he just walks away from his Neo-Nazi group and they make *NO* attempts on his life or attack his family? And on a trivial note: why go through all the trouble of setting up the fact that his mother more than likely has cancer?  There was no payoff to that whatsoever.Overall, I can't give the film any more than a 6, a smidge more than average, but not much.",Null,0,0,29 June 1999
There's Something About Mary," It would have been funny if....
","TSAM would have been funny if I hadn't seen the trailer.  The trailer was hysterical, I was laughing so hard my sides hurt, but then when I saw the movie, there wasn't anything to laugh at because I saw all the gags in the trailer a week before. So I sat there waiting for something to make me laugh and it didn't happen...and could someone PLEASE tell me who the hell keeps casting Cameron Diaz?  I agree with whomever said that Cameron could be outcast by an ironing board, she's just terrible.  I was bored by this movie.",6,0,0,23 August 1999
