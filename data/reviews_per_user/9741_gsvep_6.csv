Blade Runner 2049," excruciatingly slow and morose
","The only reason I gave this a 2, instead of a 1 is for the superb sound mixing. This is an excellent example of a lack of good editing. It was at least an hour too long. How this movie got anything over a 4 is mind boggling! People must be judging it on the special effects alone. I disliked this for so many reasons. The story has too many flaws (Bees? There is no vegetation?), the pacing is excruciatingly slow, all the characters are one dimensional, there is almost no meaningful dialogue, the violence is unnecessarily graphic, all the women are depicted as either psychopathic killers or prostitutes (with only one exception, the pitiful 'dreamer'). Did I even mention the pornigraphic statues? My best guess is this was an homage to a 'Clockwork Orange'.I could have had a more enjoyable experience watching an episode of CSI. It was like they couldn't decide whether to be a sequel or a horror movie. Sequel won, but horror movie would have worked better. There were so many scenes that could have benefited from a jump scare. It was filmed as such, with the creepy music (again the best part), the character standing alone with vast empty spaces behind them, unknown people chasing them. But they just left the character standing there. It was like a bunch of jokes with no punchlines.The holographic girlfriend was annoying and pointless. The 'sex' scene was annoying and incomplete. It was like watching my IPad buffer. And who didn't see her demise coming a mile away. Yawn.Ryan Gossling gets more unattractive to me with each additional bad movie. If I was Harrison Ford I would have punched him for real too.",2,21,43,15 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Skip this movie
","I just spent 2 hours trying to stay awake in the movie theater. Not only is this movie boring but it is a complete and total rehash of the original 1976 Star Wars. So much so that I recognized shots that were in the first movie (that were better in the first movie because Harrison Ford was in them!). I want to save people from wasting over 2 hours of their life like I just did. Just see the original and skip this completely. The original has interesting characters, humor, suspense and actors who can actually act. This was void of all of that. The characters were shallow and unbelievable as was the plot line (and lack there of). There was basically no story in the first hour and a half of this movie. And might I ask, who would adopt a child, raise it for 8 years only to abandon said child because they were afraid someone figured out who she was (they couldn't be that much of a threat if it took them 8 years to figure it out). I am now done with the Star Wars franchise. Chanting that you have the Force doesn't make it so. Spoiler, there is a Death Star but there is a way to destroy it (size may very depending on which Star Wars you are watching but otherwise that is the plot of all of the Star Wars movies). I'll just leave you with this, If you have the technology to build a planet sized spaceship that can distroy planets why do your schematics need to be on a floppy disk?",1,146,298,20 December 2016
Passengers," The special effects are necessary to the plot!
","I must admit I only went to see this movie to see the pool screen on the big screen, but boy am I glad I did! I don't know why anyone would give this a less than stellar review. The story was excellent, good plot, interesting characters, well acted and (unlike several movies I've seen lately) the special effects are Integral to the plot. My daughter begrudgingly went with us because she believed the reviewers and thought the entire movie was about 2 people killing time stranded on a spaceship. That couldn't be farther from the truth! It was one of the most human stories I've seen this Christmas season and the only one, so far, I would consider seeing again! I will recommend this to all my friends. I already called my mom and dad (in their 70's) and told them to go see it. No gratuitous violence (again, only what was needed to further the story). This is a great date movie.",10,114,220,29 December 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," a reboot not a retelling
","I went in with no expectations and was delightfully surprised.I was disappointed that they changed the actor playing him again, but after the opening sequence I was sold.It had action, character development, cool special effects-that furthered the story (and weren't just there to be pretty), and lots of humor. I'm trying to remember the last time I laughed this much in a movie. (Wonder Woman).I think this movie would be doing much better if they had stressed that it wasn't a retelling of the origin story.The only reason I didn't give it a higher score was because the best friend got on my nerves (until the end).This is a really good super hero movie.",8,34,60,3 August 2017
Arrival," Original and thought provoking
","I love a movie that keeps me guessing and this one did. The way they introduced the characters and aliens was suspenseful and interesting. I saw this in the theater for the special effects and they did not disappoint. Not only were they beautiful, they were integral to the plot. I've seen a few movies recently that felt the special effects WERE the story so it's refreshing to see a movie that used the special effects to enhance the story. They were also original and fascinating. I liked how the main character was treated by the military, it seemed authentic that she wasn't given any information. I felt like I was right there with her. In fact, I think I held my breath for the last hour of this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8,6,12,23 December 2016
Wonder Woman," Finally Character Development!
","I went into this movie with no expectations and was blown away by the story and character development. It was refreshing to actually be able to get to know the characters. I also really loved the slow motion battle scenes! I could see everything that was happening. Unlike Transfomers (which flashed by so fast I couldn't tell what was hitting what).The 2 main characters had so much chemistry it was adorable. I felt vested. The supporting characters were also just as interesting. I was surprised by how many times they made me laugh.I am recommending this movie to anyone over 13 (some of the scenes are too intense for young children). I hope this is movie paves the way for more women in Hollywood in front of, and behind the camera! Well done!",10,7,20,3 August 2017
