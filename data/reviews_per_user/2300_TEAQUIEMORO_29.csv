The Longest Yard," Much Funnier Than The Other Longest Yard
","When I heard the new longest yard I did't wanted to see it because the old longest yard was not funny and not so much action.But later I decided to see the new Longest Yard and boy do I have to say much funnier and plenty of hardcore action,lots of fun.The other director had no humor this director must be the funniest guy in the world,everybody-the prisoners,the officers, and the cheerleaders.In here it was every shorter than the old one but this one added more great parts,even the deleted scenes were funny.I was wrong about this one,the greatest comedy movie I have seen and if you don't believe me than watch it yourself and find out,you'll laugh your guts out.This will be fun for you and your family and I promise that you will not be disappointed",10,0,2,20 June 2006
Underworld," Super Cool
","I was so amazed when this was on the theater's, and I thought this movie was going to be bad. But then I saw it and you will be shocked and amazed because it's a battle between Licons and Vampires. When I was seeing the movie I thought the Vampires were the good guys, but then I learned that know-one is the good or bad guys. But I think the Vampires were actual bad because they stared the war, it all stared in the Vampires place. The Licons were slaves of the Vampires and one persons from each side had sex and the girl Vampire was per-gent, but her father was mad. So he killed his own daughter and the man Licon was angry and told the rest not to take it any-more. So now their was a war and a lot of action was happening on fighting over a teenage boy who became half Vampire and half Licons. And great sequel at the end when the second in command gets alive, and we know their is another part so I can't wait.",9,0,0,14 July 2006
Amistad," Give Us Us Freedom
","When I was learning about the African slaves and my Social Studies teacher showed us a film based on it but couldn't watch it for the horror and nudity.So later I asked the name,it was Amistad and then Saturday I went to rent the movie and later I stared seeing it.For sure I taught it was a boring documentary but right in the beginning it already stared the blood violence mutiny.Every little piece of the movie was fantastic,a great film when 9I first saw it.And in the middle I saw how they treated the slaves and believe me it was not pretty,not pretty at all.They whipped them,killed them,they bathed them horrible for selling them,danced with them,dumped some Africans of the ship,andserved them disgusting mush.Now I understand why she wouldn't let us see it.And then I found out it was directed by Seven Speilburg,amazing.I should have known-ed that this beautiful work of art was created by him.Only he can make and wonderful movie like this.Warning this my not be appropriate for people who are non-racism,but could know how they were treated and facts on something like this.",10,1,3,21 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Better Than Part One
","I saw part one of Pirates of the Caribbean and to me it was pretty good but it was an average pirate movie that had a not so good adventure,it didn't amuse me much. So later I heard that the next Pirates of the Caribbean is coming so I thought that it was going to be the same as part one but even more less amusing,but I still went. So I watched the whole thing and this is what I got to say,this movie rules out load. This was one of Gore's greatest movie that he has done.This had thriller,comedy,and plenty of action,a movie for all the fans to talk about. The thriller by me and the audience are waiting to see what the Carcan{the giant octopus}is going to attack the crew and the ship andsink it to eat them. The comedy by in the Native island Jack's and some other crew were swinging from the giant ball to grad the roots towards freedom,great and funny.And the action by the Duchman's crew fighting some of Jack's crew,and when Will,Jack and Mr.Norrington were fighting over the Duchman's heart.This movie will be the best movie that everyone have ever seen,can't wait for part three,plus two more things. At the end a certain someone for part one is alive and he is bad,and at the very end after the credits,there is something funny at the end.",8,1,3,12 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Not Bad For A Pirate Movie
","The first time that they ever made a great pirate that they made in this century, Pirates of the Caribbean. This was as good as Lords of the Rings, and had many special effects like the Lord of the Rings. Gore Virbinski was very lucky to have a great cast and crew to help him on this great pirate movie.It tells the story of a bunch of pirates who stole treasure and they didn't know that it was cursed.So because of this curse, every day for their rest of their lives they can't digest of eat/drinks what they want, and at night they become skeletons.Now they rome the earth to get all the treasure and get the blood of Will Turner and thats when we met the cast that made this film great.",8,0,3,5 November 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Scrat Still Can't Get His Nuts
","I loved this hilarious movie,people say this is better than the original and boy sure they are right.All parts of my guts are still hurting from seeing this movie,get the tickets right away to see it and than tell us your opinion on this movie which will say I loved this movie because you are gonna like it.It was burst of non-stop funny business they made here,this should have be one because part one is better than the rest of those sequels.But this time part two was much cooler and better than Ice Age 1.No way the critics can't say this is Americas Funnist Movie Of The Year.This is something worth-while to see in your whole damn life,whenever you see this movie and you're upset this is the right thing to make this cheerful when you're 'under the weather'.This movie will live on forever and its laughter will never go away.Go on and tell the world to spread the new movie that is on everyones mind on Ice Age two,the worlds greatest movie since the Godfater.Wait till Ice Age Three shows on the movies.",10,9,13,12 April 2006
Batman Returns," I Believe The Word Your Looking For Is Ahhhhhh.
","This was a fabulous part to the sequel of the original Batman that Tim Burton did.He really made this movie won't us to laugh and mostly cry a lot.Like the death sense of the Penguin{Danny DeVito} which he was just perfect,the penguins carry their master to the water for his grave.That was cute but yet very sad,they respected him.Danny DeVito put some character to the penguin and acting was good.Catwoman{Michelle Pfeiffer}was also excellent in here.She really grabbed our attention to the movie when she appears as Catwoman.Michael Keaton{Batman}the one and only once again did a good job playing as Batman.And lastly Christopher Walken{Max Shreck},all I can say to him is perfect,stupendous,wonderful,wow.When their character traits are put together you get a spectacular movie.Their roles evenly matched them,whoever got these characters give a round of applause to these hims/hers.Andlets not forget Alferd{Michelle Gough},he was an excellent Buttler.And the Ice Princess was wonderfully beautiful.Keep up the good work mister Burton",10,8,18,20 March 2006
Sleepy Hollow," The Headless Horse Man Comes For You
","Now this is the side that I would like to know from this creative person.He did a lot of fantasy movies such as Mars Attack,Planet of the Apes,Batman,all of them were great but this broke my record.All heads were flying of,the revenge of a girl,and cool special effects on the victims.All the actors the play the horseman but most on fighting parts{Ray Park}.All that kindness on Pee-Wee' Big Adventure,Corpse Bride,and The Nightmare Before Christmas,this shows he got a sick mind.And the romance is what got some of our attention,all this mushy stuff made sense in this movie.And all actors were very great,even the two people in the cottage didn't talk and it was a marvelous acting part. What I would say is see all the killing again and again and again.This is what started to make people think he should do more horror movies like this.Movie by movie of his is making him the best director.I hope when you see this movie you will start to like his films.",7,1,2,15 March 2006
Final Destination 2," You Can't Cheat Death
","This was a great sequel to the Final Destination,something too see that is gruesomely fun on this horrifying ride...it may be your last.Now death found new ways to kill the survivors from the pile-up on route 23.And here we find out Alex and Clears' way to die,one by a falling brick on his face.And one by an explosion on the hospital.This was better than the original Final Destination.It's better because they die with better gruesome accidents,nudity,and fun traps that leads to the victims life.They made more blood,action,and scary parts that we don't ever want to do that.In the Dentist scene I went there and been-careful for not the same thing to happen to me.I think it's just great when you go to the same accident in both Final Destination 1 and 2 that you remember what happen to the person.Then you look out if that's going to happen,that;s fun that you play a game with that or to scare a person with that.This will make you fasten your seat belts and to be on a look out on death.",9,0,0,3 April 2006
Corpse Bride," Just Wonderful
","This was a great movie that Tim Burton did when he did Corpse Bride with our favorite voice cast.Some our Jonny Depp,Helena Bonham Carter,Emily Watson,Christopher Lee,Michael Gough,Danny Elfman,and many more.I really liked the part were Victoria{Emily Watson}finds out that Victor{Jonny Depp}is married to the Corpse Bride{Helena Bonham Carter}and then they fight over Victor.Also when they all go to the church in our world and that's were the fun begins.And my favorite joke was when Victor finds his dog to do tricks and one is 'play dead',that was funny.This movie I give it two thumbs way up because this is a good family fun movie Tim Burton did.Peple who love family,comedy,romance movie,then this is for you.He had some great experience like the Nightmare Before Chirstmas.I know everyone will love this excellent movie.",8,0,1,21 March 2006
The Thing," The Thing vs. The Humans,Who Will Win
","John Carpenter did a real good number on this film,he did a better version of The Thing than the long time ago one.John made this a very creepy movie to see,this thing was really a creature that we had never seen that can take over our bodies and look like us.This was the same in Mimec,were a bug mimics people and nosies,but this is far worser than this creature.There was only four parts were they turned into things,one was Benning's arm that was a giant creature claw.A part were Norris has his tummy into a mouth and that his head turned into a spider.And when Blair was a two faced monster and his belly was a dog creature.And lets forget when the dog turned into a weird monster that I don't know but it was cool.This movie deserve to be in the top 250 greatest movie in U.S.I am with John Carpenter 100% to help this into the top 10 great movies.",10,0,1,2 April 2006
Over the Hedge," Great Family Movie
","When I saw the first seek peek on Over the Hedge I thought I was going to be bored,so later the day it showed I watched it and I was amazed.This is a not bad movie that I've seen,for sure I know-ed this is a bad cheesy movie but I was wrong.I loved this movie they made,it was funny,teaches a lesson,and great for families to watch.Each of these cute little critter had a memorable moment to remember that animal.Hammy for his extra fast funny mouth,RJ for his smarts and planner,and Verne for keeping a family.This was also very sad on betrayal but learns a lesson,this movie taught me life by comparing animals to us.So don't stay here,go and watch this miracles movie everybody is talking about.",8,2,3,30 May 2006
Edward Scissorhands," A Very Wonderful Materpiece
","I think Tim Burton really put some heart in this movie,it was really great.I especially like when Edward killed Kims' boyfriend Jim,it was really sad.And cool tricks on dog and women haircut,and cutting realistic things on the hedges.The romance between a teenage girl and a invented man was just great.And sculpting on the block of ice was awesome.On this movie Tim just put a little bit of everything in here.I think it was great when Edwards' dad {the inventor} that the heart cookie made Edward.And very sad his dad died on Christmas eve,I felt just crying.Also very fascinating how Edward would look like.Jonny Depp and Winona Rider made this film really come alive.From a rating 1-10 I will give it more than 10,I will give it 15.If any other director remake this film it will have 1 star.No remake can replace this movie,not even Peter Jackson can make this film better than the way Tim Burton made it.",10,0,1,16 March 2006
Saw III," Suffering,You Haven't Seen Anything
","Wow! I mean wow, this was so worth seeing it in the movie, I know all the Saw fans will just be amazed with Jigsaw's new traps to people that don't respect their lives. And I like the twist when Amanda is going to take his place when the old man dies. This was sick-twisted, mind blowing,horror fun to see and get scared. Because once your in Jigsaw little horror game for the only way out is courage, trust, and blood, so if you don't have what it takes then it's of to hell for you. So don't forget to see the other Saw movies because if it wasn't for those to movies then we won't have Saw 3 right now.So go watch Saw 3 because this is top one on the best horror movie in 2006, so have fun.",9,2,9,26 October 2006
The Butterfly Effect," Finally A Good Movie For All To See
","This was the first ever movie from 2004 that was amazing from beginning to end was great,with a lot of effects.This was a little boy who gets blackouts and starts writing on journals what happened on his day.So one night his girlfriend died and later looked back at his notes to remember and went back to that time.And every time he changes something,in the future it gets worse ,just one change and everyones lives are changed.But at the end it was really not happening and looks back at his home videos at were Evan met her.Then he is being mean so she doesn't like him and her+tommy had a nice life with their mom.And Evan and his friend also has a nice life,man it was the bomb.What I don't like was the a*****e critics gave it two stars,it deserves three and a half stars.It was a wonderful movie made and it has 2,I hope they die in hell.And people listening to my comment,in 2007 go see part 2 of this movie and trust me it will be great.They and I won't let you down we promise,go and see this part too,it's great.",8,0,1,23 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Very Sad
","When I heard about X-Men 3 I thought this may not be good because I saw 1 and 2,it was not that interesting to me.But I heard that they said Professer Xavier was going to die in this movie and I was surprised.So I went to see it and I was amazed of all that hard work and let me tell you that was the best X-Men part that I have seen.All was non-stop action and seeing more and better character in each part,but this was the best.And the seen that surprised us all was the death of Xavier,and Cyclops.And all the gangs of the brotherhood of mutants and what will happen to Mystique in the next part and to Magnet's power.And ever since I saw this I know there is going to be more parts to the X-Men.And to tell you something is see the end of X-Men after all the credits,there will be a big surprise when you'll watch it,and to find out you got to get the tickets before they will ran out of.Then you will never know what happens,and once again go see the next X-Men,it will answer all your questions and mine,can't wait to see it on the big screen again.",10,0,2,1 June 2006
Saw II," Oh Yes...There Will Be Blood.
","This was a insane movie,all the cool traps that Jigsaw did for the people to survive his game.And the traps were really cool like the Venus-Fly Trap.And The Neddles in the Pit,the Arm Trapper,the Oven,and the gun shot key-hole.In Saw 1 it didn't show Jigsaw or his real name,but in here we knows this time who he is.This is better than Saw 1 because less traps and victims means not so good.The more the creepier this movie gets to become.This also makes us learn a lesson,if you don't appreciate life than you don't deserve life,a good lesson for all of us.Now we know we should appreciate life or we will be in Jigsaws' games.And in every ones mind is,is Jigsaw dead or alive.And is Matthews' father going to be in Saw 3 or not.I like this movie a best horror movie created,thank-you because now we know we want to see Saw 3.I Know I will love Saw 3 100%.",10,0,1,9 April 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," The Factory Opens Again
","This was filled with lots of bursting laughter when we saw this movie.This remake was a little make different than the one that was a long time ago in the 70's.Tim Burton really made this film according to the book than some different senses like the squirrels.In the old movie she fell from the garbage place,and in the old one they didn't had the huge boat and not so many Ompas.And the alternative end was very different,in here it showed what happened to the losers when they didn't listen.In the old movie it showed when Charlie learned a lesson of trust and ling but didn't showed what happened to the rest of them.And showed something new,parts of mister Wonkas' childhood life,that was something never seen ed.And when grandpa Joe was working in the factory.This was something be on good,it was even better than the original WILLY Wonka and longer,but this was still good.",7,2,3,21 March 2006
Big Fish," A World Of Fantasy
","This was probably to me better than Ed Wood.This was about drama,fantasy,and some crazy adventures on the way.They way he tried to find out about the myths his father told him,especially at the beginning it showed that big fish which was the title.When he starts of his adventures this is were I am paying more attention to the movie.This was simply all just magic,all these special effects on the myths is were it starting to come alive.Just comes right popping in your face.This had something more than when Tim Burton just showed the premiere of Ed Wood.I think most of his movies should all be like this one.I can just say keep on making these f%%%%%g cool movies like this.Your biggest and favorite st fan Cesar,I'll keep writing to you.",9,0,1,21 March 2006
Grindhouse," Two Movies For The Price Of One
","This was an amazing double feature film, this was the one film that America has just waited for. Now Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez have finally made their best movie and they were working together. They made other great movies like Sin City, Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Once Upon A Time In Mexico. But Grindhouse will be the greatest hit of their movies. The first feature is Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. It's about a group of survivors must stop an evil of dead after an experiment went wrong. Rose McGowan did a great job playing Cherry, a gal without a leg and then becomes a gun. Freddy Rodriguez did the 'never miss killer guy' which was perfect for him as EL Wray. Josh Brolin who did Dr.William Block who was a very crazy guy in Planet Terror and lastly the bad ass chick besides Cherry was Dr.Dakota Block. Then was Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof, it was about a guy named Stuntman Mike who is having a fun time with a bunch of girls, by killing them. He is risking his life as well as the girls who are inside the car, and he always comes back alive with his car. This was a great part for Kurt Russell for playing Stuntman Mike, he raises the roof. All the girls which were awesome, no regrets because Jordan Ladd, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Zoe Bell were bad ass chicks. But Rose McGowan, Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Ferlito were the real girls in Death Proof that showed these girls are hardcore. This movie has it all, gore, action, and nudity.This movie will be in the top for all Tarantino and Rodriguez fans, this sure is in my top.The first one is Planet Terror which is about the military send out monsters the infected people, the soldier's are to but they use this mask with gas to heal them.So in this little town Cherry was with El Wray were talking then crash, then a monster tears out Cherry's leg, not bit. El Wray takes here to the hospital were also is a room full out infected people. The disease spreads and I'll stop up to here, but when you watch the rest it a hardcore action fill with gore, sex, and guns. This part deserves 4 stars. The next is Death Proof, a more calmer movie or is it when a derange driver Stuntman Mike comes in the film.A bunch of girls are about to have a ride to hell, in the beginning there are a set of girls that really matched and had stuff to say, then with Stuntman Mike look at these girls and have fun with them he kills them and boy was it gruesome.Then the next set comes and they were a bit uninteresting, it was the same thing only this time in the car chase, it switches. The girls are after have, which I think was funny and I liked how it ended. If u want to find out if they killed him or not, watch it. To me as a horror movie no, as a action, funny movie yes so 3 and a half stars to me. And of course the great trailers. Machte, Don't, Thanksgiving, Werewolf women of the S.S., and Hobo with a Shotgun. The ones that were best and should be a movie is Machte and Thanksgiving. Machte for action and Thanksgiving for a s##t full of gore. Watch Grindhouse now, a total 4 star movie.",10,27,61,27 March 2007
Saw," I Want To Play A Game
","I want to play a game called death because my god what a great movie. There have been a lot of bad horror movies and remakes but this is totally different, new, and great ways of a death traps. Seeing the people killing themselves when the master mind Jigsaw set them up. This is a movie about two guys locked in the room trying to get out but they are locked in with a saw and tape recorders. Leaving clues on how to get out but meanwhile these detectives come and see these other death that people got themselves killed with these traps. Saw will have you wondering and figuring out how will they get out and you is this Jigsaw. And a bigger twist, the doctors family is with Jigsaw. And in order to get his family he must do two things and you will find out when you watch the movie.",7,0,1,16 November 2007
War of the Worlds," It's Better Than The Old One
","This movie kicks ass.This is about a man you takes care of his ex-wife kids,but a lightning rode crashes aliens to their world.Now they have to survive against an army of aliens.Nowhere to run,nowhere to hide, because everything is destroyed.Steven Spielberg is one of the most science fiction director in the f*****g world.He did great movies like,E.T or Jurassic Park.I liked this movie because it scared the s**t out of me.All the Martians was blasting all the people, in this they had no mercy on their evil souls.Well this has been Cesar Valderrama, your number 1 fan Mr. Spielberg and keep directing.8/10",8,0,6,11 November 2005
30 Days of Night," The Scariest, Dark,Gory,Chilling,Heart-pounding Vampire Movie Ever
","Many cirtics are giving this movie one , one and a half, or two. But this movie really deserves three or four, that's how good this movie is. It had scary music to give the chills, the unsuspecting kill that the Vampires kill to give suspense, and great gore for the deaths. This is a simple movie about a town that are getting killed by Vampires, but for 30 days of night. As the days go by one by one the survives die and I love the scary music to go with them dying. I haven't seen a good vampire movie since John Carpenter's Vampires. If you think the graphic novel is gory and exciting, wait till you watch it. The only thing wrong about this movie was the ending. First I wish the vampire fight was longer and he killed more of those vampires. Second is I think everyone should have died. Not four survives, and the way the died was sad but I was hoping the ending that since he kissed her wife before he died she should have turned into one for the sequel.Lastly if you were in the movie theater there were subtitles that were distracting. Again, a great,gory, suspenseful movie and I know this movie shall do well because of the director. I have to loved this movie because this was a dark version of what if Vampires existed. The cast was great, loved kills, this is the best Vampire movie because of Sam Raimi. Give this guy a big hand. This movie needs to have 9/10, keep making movies like these.",9,5,9,6 November 2007
Jaws," The First Meanest Fish Is Coming To New York City To Take Your Breath Away
","Mr.Steven Spielburg has done it once again,is their nothing that he can do so good because this was an excellent film and that cause of the was of sharks,we couldn't done it without your help.This was this first Shark movie ever made which than more director started to make more better improved sharks all thanks to Spielburg.And liked the great entrance of Jaws,with that scary and creepy music is when we know he is coming,love that music,Dana...Dana...Dan...Dan,Dana.This was the far greatest film that immediately had to be in the top 250 greatest film of all time and placed in #86,not bad in the top 250,not bad at all.First he does Raiders of the Lost Ark,War of the Worlds remake,E.T.,Jurassic Park,but when everyone saw this be become the luckiest guy on earth to make movies.So far all of his movies won Oscars and Emmys and had three or more star which makes him the best Director in the face of the universe,I know his next film will be great like his other movies.Never die Mr.Spielburg,never die,make more fantastic movies like Jaws.",8,0,1,17 April 2006
Carrie," Don't Ever Mess With This Girl
","This is one teenager girl that you want to make fun of because she will find you,and than kill you.This was a totally awesome movie,it kicked ass.Who knew a little girl who had a horrible life with her damn mother can scare you to death once she found out she has it.Carrie really needed that power because those people needed to be taught a lesson to make a poor little girl cry.And I can't believe the teacher laughed when the pig's blood got all over on Carrie,I thought her all wrong.Though this was a long time ago movie and a little blood was here,the music was suspenseful because you don't know what's gonna happen after the creepy music.And a good opening when all the girls came out from the shower naked,a really love that part with all the tits.All I have to thank is the director for a great Carrie,and a special applaud to Steven King.Without the novel it would be great without it.",9,1,1,10 April 2006
Final Destination," Your Next
","I really loved this movie,that death has to kill them in death designs,it was worth seeing it.What I really loved was the way how they died,and the signs death gave them how they were going to die.The thing that really made me pay attention was the premonitions Alex had.The airplane crash,the rope,the bus, the knife,the car piece,and the 180 sign made this my top horror movie.The characters made us feel scared because you don't know how and when they are going to die,it's just a big surprise.And tony Todd{Buldworth}really got to know death and the center of attention.I bet he is death because how does he know much about it,am I right.I hope they will continue the Final Destination no matter what.I will keep on seeing it till I die and you should to because I still want to be frightened by it because you never know when it's your day to die.",9,0,3,30 March 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Nice Claws You Got There Mr. Crueger
","This was the new movie that every-body like and that they say and I agree that this gave a new definition to the word nightmare,and this was all done by none-other than Mr. Wes Craven,he did a great job on this movie.Wes Craven did not gave us a movie that he wanted to put because he liked it.No he gave us the best film that every-one will love to see from all ages.When I went to rent Friday the Thirteen to compare this with Nightmare on Elm Street,F.T.T was nothing.It was put to shame,that director putted anything he like and that is why N.O.E.S. was better than Jason.It was not so bad but to see it on boring days when their is nothing to see but it will make it even boring.Wes Craven was the master of horror and scary films that everyone loved.Only part one and eight of Nightmare on Elm Street was great because both was directed by Wes Craven,the only film that was great from the movies.This movie should have be in the top 250 greatest movie,something new to see that brings terror only in are nightmares which is cool and spooky at the same time.",8,0,0,17 April 2006
300," 300 Stars For Me
","This is the greatest historical movie ever as a graphic novel book. When I saw the preview I was going to see this movie no matter what. And when I saw it, I saw more than what I have seen. Even if they extended they way the monsters looked it was great, the action, romance war they had in Sparta. Zack did his best in this movie, it blows your mind and makes you part of the movie. The Persions may have more allies to help but were imperiled to the Spartans. This is a great movie to learn what happen back in Greece a long time ago. Even the all mighty Xerxes couldn't kill them because they worked as a group, all the same moves turns and kills. They were as one, unlike the Persions.This was great and had to have 10 stars, bravo 300, your in my top.",10,1,4,22 November 2007
Beetlejuice," A New Funny Ghost In Town And His Name is Beetle Juice
","I think this was one of his best films that Tim Burton did in his whole life.Over 93% of people must love this great film,it should be top 205 in top 250 greatest movie.The acting was all good and funny,especially Mickeal Keaton.He was a very funny person in this film,he was born to play Beetle Juices' role.I hope he will make another part to this,and Mickeal Keaton will play his role again.If you did not see this film,go outside to a video store,and rent it or buy it.I have the movie and you should to.I all ready give the movie 4 stars.I love this movie more than Star Wars.Some of his other movies were okay like Planet of the Apes,Corpse Bride,Batman,but this beat them all.I love you Tim Burton,you are my second favorite director,next to Spiliburg",8,1,2,14 March 2006
