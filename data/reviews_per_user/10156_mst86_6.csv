Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Two Words People: IT SUCKED!
","ONE OF THE CRAPPIEST MOVIES EVER MADE.  SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE VERY IMPRESSIVE.  BUT THERE ARE 5 MAIN THINGS THAT MAKE THIS FILM DESPISABLE:(1). It downright Sucks(2). That child actor (I've begged Hollywood not to put any more in movies or tv shows anymore)(3). Jar Jar Binks (I don't think there is much more to say)(4). The Plot (What plot?)(5). The Acting (There was acting in this movie?  I thought it was narrated.)I must say, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a lot better than this pile of horse *&$@.  But it was a little more enjoyable than Wild Wild West.",Null,0,1,23 September 1999
Batman Returns," easily better than the original
","The second installment into the Batman series is better than the first.  The plot is great and so is the acting.  What makes this better than the original is that it lightens up a bit.  It has more comedy here and there and Bruce Wayne isn't as bitten by revenge.The story goes like this:  The Penguin and Catwoman team up to try and destroy Batman.  The Pengiun becomes mayor and makes Batman hated. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle (Catwoman) develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne (Batman).6/10 stars",6,1,2,1 January 2000
Coyote Ugly," AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
","This movie nearly drove me to insanity it was so bad!  This isn't even one of those movies where it's so bad it's funny!  Really, it's a lethal weapon. It gave me a pounding headache.  But really, what else could you expect from Jerry Bruckheimer.  He has absolutely no respect for human life at all! He's the guy who brought us Armageddon and Gone in Sixty Seconds, Con Air, and countless other B-movies.Avoid at all costs.  I walked out after 50 minutes!",1,3,5,7 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," ARGUABLY THE BEST MOVIE EVER
","How could anyone place any other science fiction movie above this one. 2001: A Space Odyssey set the stage for most sci-fi films after it.  Star Wars sucks compared to this.  It won a much deserved Academy Award for Special Effects.In AFI's 100 Best Movies Ever it holds a spot at #22.  On the IMBd Top 250 it is at 43.  It should be a lot higher than that!I love this film, I hate Star Wars.  Star Wars is Evil.  I want to hurt Star Wars.  Star Wars should be at the bottom 100 movies ever made.  Especially Episode 1.",10,1,3,20 September 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," THE ULTIMATE TRIP --- THE ULTIMATE MOVIE
","I am surprised to see all of the negative comments on here.  This movie is a masterpiece.  Five years in the making, $10.5 million 1960's dollars!The people who say that it is 'boring' are probably some immature teenagers who think that STAR WARS or STAR TREK can not be beaten.  They think that the only sci-fi is a bunch of aliens invading earth, or people on a flying spaceship trying to save earth or explore other worlds.2001: A Space Odyssey is true sci-fi.  Nothing comes close.  I do not care what anybody says, it is simply the best movie ever made.It is extremely influential and highly-entertaining.4/4 Stars",10,1,4,1 November 1999
The Matrix," This really, really sucks.
","Anyone with half of a brain could see right through this mainstream Hollywood garbage.The effects are not 'spectacular' (they are loud, annoying, and overblown) the acting isn't 'great' (It sucks).It's kind of like Bill & Ted's Adventures Through an Alternate Reality.Most of the 'serious dramatic scenes' were laughable.  I am outraged that this is number 38 on the all-time 250!!!  It should be in the bottom 100.It's talk, talk, talk, with something remotely resembling an action sequence popping up on the screen every 30 minutes.  It looks like a crazed computer ate up a roll of film and spat it back out.You are WAY, WAY, WAY better off watching the GREAT movies like Citizen Kane or City Lights or Superman: The Movie!!I give it a 0 out of 10, it's a BOMB!!!But, I'm sure the over-crazed Matrix fans will have some lame excuses for all the movie's shortcomings.",1,19,44,24 February 2001
