Black Swan," Male fantasies galore
","I consider myself a sophisticated film-goer who loves indie films, but I was extremely disappointed in this movie and am surprised that it is being taken so seriously (although I know Hollywood considers Darren Aronofsky a genius). It is about women, but not real women. Instead we are presented with a completely male-oriented fantasy: the repressed ice queen vs. the slut, with lesbian sex thrown in to spice it up. And the horror element becomes ridiculous towards the end, like The Exorcist in toe shoes. People in the audience I saw it with laughed. I also did not care for it artistically: grainy jumpy hand-held camera shots interspersed with lots of camera-in-the-face close ups which usually cut off the top part of people's heads. But that is a personal preference.",1,46,115,21 December 2010
