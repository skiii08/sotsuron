Hereditary," WTF was this
","C'mon people,You call this scary. This was pretty much boring movie with more then one WTF moments. Brother kills his sister in a car accident and no police is involved,no investigaton. It just happened and thats it...WTF moment. The end is major WTF moment. Well i must admit acting was ok,even tho husband could have been played by anyone and not by someone good as Byrne. Movie is very slow drama,with not so much scary moments. Dont expect any jumping from the seat.",4,0,2,25 August 2018
