Requiem for a Dream," When you think life can't get any worse, you're WRONG
","This movie is just great. Based on the reality and the actors are just playing great. This movie shows how bad things can go wrong. It starts with a happy family, everything goes better and better. But when they reached the top, everything goes wrong and they fall all the way down.
It surprised me how bad things went after they were doing so great. It's not just another movie with a happy end, thats what makes this movie so good, it's unique.When you think life can't get any worse, you should watch this movie and it will change your mind!",10,0,1,13 January 2002
