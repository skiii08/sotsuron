Blade Runner 2049," Awesome Sequel! I love it!
","Excellent movie. I'm a huge fan of Blade Runner and this movie doesn't disappoint. Such emotional! Awesome! Bravo! Well written script, excelsior photography, awesome soundtrack (although i missed Vangelis, he really missed it). Watch this movie! I recommend it! But attention: watch it quiet, unhurried, unworried, healthy and rested. Don't expect a movie full of twists and action all the time. Blade Runner requires ATTENTION, reflection, immersion, and philosophy about existentialism.*SPOILERS FINAL'S SCENE EXPLAIN*When Roy cries in the rain we can realize this: we don't see his tears, because the rain hides it. However we KNOW he is crying (a masterpiece subliminal scene). This scene reveals Roy's frustration and reveals that Time (or Death) actually destroyed all the experiences he lived (real or not), but importants for him by losting them, attributing insignificance to them.On another hand at the same scene the movie cut to the Deckard's face and what we see? Deckard's crying in the rain, but WE CAN SEE his tears highlighted. This time, the rain don't hide the tears. Why? Because this moment won't be lost in time, unlike Roy said. Because Deckard learned with Roy the meaning of what is be human, and what is the valor of life. In other words, Roy and his lesson won't be lost in time. He will be remembered forever, in one way or another.Now, when i saw the last Blade Runner 2049' scene, i've confirmed that theory (what made me cry): Joe (Agent K) laid down on the stairs, 'Crying in the Snow'. The snow represents the peace and calm with himself, but once more the movie show us his frustrate tears highlighted. WE CAN SEE his tears. Why? Joe, despite sadness and frustration, DIES KNOWING HE WILL BE REMEMBERED, unlike Roy, because he did (willingly, free of chains) the right (and relevant) thing by saving Deckard's life and providing the meeting with his daughter. In other words, these tears won't be lost in time, like tears in snow.So, both Roy and Joe, died doing the right thing that has eternalized in the world, unleashing important events, so that they will never be lost. The difference is that Roy died thinking that he and his actions (and memories) would be forgotten, while Joe don't.ï»¿",10,4,13,13 October 2017
