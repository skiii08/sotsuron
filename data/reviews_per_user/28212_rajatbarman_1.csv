The Avengers," The Avengers = EPIC!
","The mere idea of bringing all the Super-heroes together made this movie a hit, it was epic indeed. It totally lives up to your expectations. Some scenes in this movie are unexpectedly hilarious. Everyone in the cast did a great job. Mark Ruffalo was a excellent replacement for Edward Norton, everyone was disappointed by Hulk's character not being played by Edward (including me), But I'd say Mark was up to the mark. If you're looking for a break from your daily-routine stressed life, go to the theaters and watch this movie. The Avengers has all the ingredients needed for a Hit movie. Thor + Stark + Hulk + Captain America = Epic",10,6,13,27 April 2012
