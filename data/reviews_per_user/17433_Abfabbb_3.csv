It," Excessive F BOMBS
","Once again, another movie that tries to pander to what 'writers' think is the current 'speak' of teens---but it is overkill and so annoying that it ruins the entire movie. F word constantly interjected and the kids sound like Goonies on crack. It just perpetuates the low class speaking habits of teens..",Null,0,1,4 June 2019
Avatar," Blue
","Avatar was the most talked about and hyped movie of the season. I watched the Oscars and wondered why it did not get Best Picture or Best Director and also why it got NO awards at the BAFTA's in the U.K. When I rented the DVD it became clear as to why it mysteriously didn't capture awards yet was the darling of critics and viewers alike. In praise of Avatar---it is visually stunning, exciting and mesmerizing and should be seen on that merit alone. Like Disney's Fantasia and Star Wars---it is groundbreaking for its time and a must see. The problem lies in the storyline. It seems to have used other hit movies to create a a visually stunning hybrid with a contemporary ecological message. It rips off the Matrix, Jurassic Park but its main storyline is Dances With Wolves. So much so that it ruined the movie for me. I knew the entire plot within the first half hour once I got wind of this. So its lipstick and a tutu on a pig. Great entertainment and fun for 3D freaks but tedious overall. I much prefer Dances With Wolves.",5,1,4,15 May 2010
Crazy Heart," very disappointing
","The glowing reviews, Oscar buzz and Oscar win for Jeff Bridges made me think this movie was going to be great. I was very bored and disappointed. The story could have been played out in 1 hour on television. Jeff Bridges was very convincing in his role but the story and supporting cast did not make it an Oscar worthy performance. Nothing unique, Im sure, for Jeff to play boozy in a bar with a twang accent. The music was a bright spot. I felt Colin Farrell was a total miscast. He seemed very out of place in the movie as BB's ex music partner. I don't know of any attractive, young women that would be falling in love with a washed up and alcoholic singer. Not plausible. Most young women are kind of repulsed by older men unless they are rich. Very boring story drags on predictably......the ending falls flat and I was glad it was over. The movie/story seemed like it would be more meaningful back in 1975ish---Bob Dylan and country being replaced by Springsteen and disco. In 2009, it seems dated, out of touch and not plausible. Yes, as a Hallmark or Lifetime movie for women----no as a feature film and Oscar contender. Im shocked it got such high reviews. My sister and mother saw it after me and agreed with me. Boring. They didn't even finish watching it. I did.",3,3,7,7 June 2010
