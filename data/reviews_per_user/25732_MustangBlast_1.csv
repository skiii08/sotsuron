Black Swan," Do not fall for the hype
","I implore you to not fall for the hype and not waste your valuable time and money on this utter piece of garbage like unfortunately I did. Despite some interesting dance scenes, this movie is the perfect example of how low you can get with the emotional exploitation of an otherwise intriguing subject. Lesbian sex, fear on the subway from creepy guys, fear of rivals trying to eliminate you, oppressive mother, drug-induced hallucination, suicidal tendencies, self-mutation and all done in a blatantly obvious, clich√®istic manner with no plot and no real character development involved. Predictable, boring even in offensive way. What a bluff. And it is almost funny, how many people fell for this bluff.",1,13,22,27 February 2011
