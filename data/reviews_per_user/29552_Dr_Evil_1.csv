Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Two hours of stunning visuals...
","SW:TPM was a visual wonder.It is certainly the most visually pleasing film I've ever seen,but unfortunately,amazing visuals don't make an amazing film.The plot is fairly standard (nothing new,but I can deal with it),but the acting and character development are below average. Even during a three second funeral scene (maybe more than three seconds,but it was under a minute ^_^;) the remaining characters show no signs of emotion.Well,Amidala had a slight tear in her eye,but she made no attempt to look any different than usual... The best acting in the movie comes from Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn,the worst comes from Natalie Portman's Queen Amidala.The droning,monotonous tone that she spoke in became very annoying,but not as annoying as....Jar-Jar Binks,resident idiot. ~_~;; I -hated- him,and so did the other people I saw the film with.I was hoping I'd be watching his funeral at the end of the film,but no such luck...Another thing,Darth Maul was a wasted character.No explanation on his past or anything,and only a few spoken words from the character himself.The fight at the end was very disappointing (well,the sequence was interesting,but the overall speed at which things take place seemed very fast.We can spend what seems like half an hour on a silly pod race ((which was good -- for the first five minutes)),but so much less on a -major- duel between good and evil ((and a funeral to a main character?)))All in all,it's just an average film.Great costumes,great visuals...and that's about it.",Null,0,1,25 May 1999
