The Incredible Hulk," Fantastic movie!
","I just saw this movie this past Monday night. Well actually at first, we were going to see Indiana Jones but it was too late for that so we decided to see the Incredible Hulk. I wasn't really all that excited for this film because I wasn't a big fan of superhero movies like the Hulk but boy did it prove me wrong.This movie was awesome! The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat and the graphics were outstanding. Great acting by not just by Ed Norton but by Liv Tyler and the General {I think William Hurt} Kinda got confused in the beginning but I am sure glad we chose this movie. I was much, much better than I expected!9/10",9,5,8,19 June 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not that good
","Of course I am a NASCAR fan and when I read the reviews, they said it will offend NASCAR fans.Well, I was super excited when this movie came out and ignored the reviews but after seeing this, I should of listened to the reviews. This movie does offend me at times. It's just a stupid movie. What offended me the most is the gay driver. That probably ruined it right there. and Will Ferrell is such a funny guy and I enjoy watching his movies. He was OK. Not the best. I still didn't really like it though. I mean they were some good parts but overall, I'll give it a 4.5/10.",5,1,4,24 October 2007
