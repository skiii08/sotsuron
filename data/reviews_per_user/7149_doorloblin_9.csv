Gremlins," Cheesy, Stupid, Fun Movie
","This movie is so dumb and corny but its so funny and its just a fun movie to watch. Darkly hilarious at times and funny because of the effects at others. Lots of fun to watch, just an enjoyable mindless movie. An essential 80s movie. I love this movie.",9,1,2,7 June 2019
Us," Creepy but dumb
","This movie is fun to watch, and creepy. However its not near as scary as people say, and the 'hands across america' statement at the end is stupid, illogical, and pointless. So now that the tethered are free, they are just gonna stand in a line and hold hands? So dumb. And how did they kill EVERYONE? They have scissors. What about the army? And if the military is still around, which they are logically, they could easily wipe out a bunch of people with scissors. I am NOT racist, the fact that some people are is sickening. But the political messages about it are pointless in a horror movie.",7,3,5,14 May 2019
Terminator Salvation," Abandons the Vision of T1-3
","This movie would have made a good stand alone film, but it is not a good terminator film. Heck, it doesn't have the feel of a terminator film at all. The charm is gone. Arnold is gone. And while Christain Bale is a great actor, he was not a good choice for John. It just doesn't have that same fun, charming, action style like the first two films, and even the third. The grit and brown color just doesn't fit.",4,0,0,5 November 2019
Alien," Entertaining, not scary at all
","Its more wondering what is going to happen, but lots of people say this film is scary. Its not. Not at all. Creepy atmosphere, yes. But scary, no. It is however a cool story and the set design is the coolest scifi design I have ever seen. Its worth a watch.",8,0,4,31 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Redeems a Struggling Franchise
","The Force Awakens was flawed but still overall enjoyable and good. Rogue One was also a pretty dang good film. Then Solo and The Last Jedi happened. Solo was a good idea with very poor execution, and The Last Jedi is a disaster. I will say people take their hate for TLJ way too far. But anyways, the franchise was struggling. Then they made this film, The Rise of Skywalker. Mind blown. This film is shocking (in a good way), visually stunning, very well written (especially compared to other non-original trilogy Star Wars movies) and overall just a very thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the Saga. One reason TLJ was bad was the dialogue. The dialogue was pretty terrible. In TROS, the dialogue is a big step up. Still not the most talented dialogue writing EVER, but the failed attempts at humor and cheesy remarks are almost completely gone. The action is great and exciting. The film offers a very satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga. It is a very fitting end. As for critic reviews, they don't like it because of the fan service. But guess what, fans are going to really appreciate and even love the fan service. It sounds like they are just kissing up to fans after TLJ, but if you think about it thats kind of what a good franchise writer would do. They hear complaints and fix it to make it enjoyable, and pays homage and mimics the tone of the best installments in the series. All I can say to summarize that is that The Rise of Skywalker is awesome, and ends the saga very well",9,2,10,20 December 2019
The Village," Beautiful film suffered from poor marketing
","This movie is amazing. Its so emotionally gripping and overall a beautiful film. It has its creepy moments and the story keeps you hooked. The critics are wrong, this is an amazing film, Shyamalan at his best. And the excellent soundtrack adds even more beauty to the film. And this review is coming from a person who usually likes over the top action movies. THIS IS NOT A SPOILER: The twist at the end is thoughtful, not a cheap shock. Critics only dislike it because of the 'dissapointing' twist, which is a shame. Shyamalan made two movies with a twist, and critics started to expect it. I love the ending. Last thing, this is not a horror movie. It has a few creepy moments, but it is more of a drama. I think some people don't like it because they expected a horror movie and its not.",10,4,4,14 May 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Worthy Harry Potter Prequel
","Great movie, captures the feel of the magical wonder of the wizarding world that Harry Potter fans fell in love with. If you don't like this movie you are not a Harry Potter 'fan'. Many people reviewing this movie say there were fans of the Harry Potter MOVIES. I got news for you, Harry Potter was first a book series, and they had to cut some stuff for the movies. So yes, there are connections to Harry Potter in this movie. The only problem is people who have seen MOST of the Harry Potter MOVIES ONCE review this movie and complain about it. To all of you who are like that, stop it. This is obviously for Harry Potter fans so don't complain about something you don't understand",9,1,1,5 September 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," How do people like this garbage
","Boring, stupid, and mind-numbing. (This isnt a spoiler because this is how the movie starts) The opening scene with the people in ape costumes is so ridiculous. Its like 20 minutes long and its literally ape walking around and grunting. Why could they not have found that monolith in 5 minutes instead of a stupid 20 minute scene. Its so bad and cheesy. The effects are terrible (however this is from 1968 so it doesn't really matter) but people say its a visually stunning movie. Its not. I have no idea what was happening story wise, because the movie is poorly written. And could someone please get the classical music to stop playing?! When it goes on as long as it did it is just distracting and annoying. Its stupid to rant about this but as a big movie fan I am insulted that people say this is a great movie. This film doesn't inspire awe, it inspires me to turn off the TV",2,7,19,16 May 2019
Gladiator," For a bloody Rome set movie its really boring
","The fight scenes are good, but thats about it. Story is good in theory but the movie is drawn out I had a hard time watching the whole thing. I wish I could describe why I don't like it better, but all I can say is thats ITS SO BORING. I watch a ton of movies, I love movies. And because of this I hate seeing all the reviews that say this is one of the best movies ever.",4,1,4,16 May 2019
