Ford v Ferrari," Generic, Often Lazy, With Striking Visuals And Race Sequences
","I did not receive the gene that fires interest in cars. I do not drive; I have no passion, not one iota for cars and engines and mechanics. I don't understand them and don't particularly want to do so. Which is why this film had little attraction for me.But it was Easter weekend, and it was on cheap to rent, and at wife's recommendation (who had seen it in the cinema), we watched it. I still have no interest in cars and engines, having watched it. There were parts of the dialogue I didn't understand a word of - or more correctly, I understood most of the words, but not the order they were used in. Those parts of the script I did understand seemed often to be lazy and far too much on the nose. Christian Bale's performance is odd to the point of being unintentionally laughable; replete with Mary Poppins-like Britishisms which sound out of place even coming from this British actor, whose accent in this film is hard to take seriously. On the other hand, Matt Damon is quietly brilliant, very possibly his best performance in many years; unshowy, subtle and investing his character with a depth the script never reaches.There remain other inadequacies in the film: a ludicrous brawl between the two lead characters, and a pathetic reduction of women to roles which support or prop-up the men, peering through curtains, fetching drinks, adorning visuals. Why are cars always referred to in the feminine? It became more obvious to me here; because it enables the men who drive them and build them to continue to exploit them and shape them around their needs the way they do with women in their lives.In the end, this is little more than a genre sports film, following all of the standard story beats of sports films to a conclusion I knew was coming as a sports fan with only a very passing knowledge of motorsport. It's a true story, but no less generic for it. But it does work - motorsports are the most cinematic of sports, not least because we have much of the film grammar of them drilled into us by car chases and the like. The racing scenes are adrenalised, gripping and alarming - the louder your sound system and the larger your screen, the more you'll enjoy them. They are beautifully directed; and throughout the whole film, the cinematography is subtle but strikingly beautiful. There's much to enjoy and entertain, perfect for a holiday weekend. But it will fade from the memory quickly, the only lingering question being why it garnered so much attention on cinematic release at the expense of far superior films from female directors.",7,0,2,13 April 2020
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A change of tone from the first two, but gripping and engaging nonetheless
","It's a tough gig adapting much-loved books for the screen, especially if the one you're dealing with is generally seen as the weakest in an overwhelmingly popular series. That's the ground we are on with this, the third of the Hunger Games movies. The third and final book in the trilogy seems to be the least regarded by fans (I haven't read them myself); and with the now almost inevitable decision having been taken to split the final story into two films, one could argue that the film-makers have made a rod for their own backs.I really liked both of the first films. They were witty, exciting, disturbing and though treading similar ground managed to deal with sufficiently different narrative and thematic material to suggest to effect a meaningful progression between the two. This third film marks a narrative departure: there's no central motif of gladiator-style combat-as-entertainment to build central action sequences around. Instead, we're in the territory where a Katniss-fronted revolution is being plotted whilst Peeta remains behind in the Captiol, apparently manipulated into being a spokesperson for the Big Brother style-regime. Instead of intense action thriller we have what amounts to an intense and involving political thriller, this time taking the politicising of the media into its satirical and thematic spotlight. There's good action sequences as well, but this isn't an action movie in the sense of the other two.That's where disappointment may kick in for some viewers. It's a big call for a major franchise like this one to change its tone so drastically mid-stream; I can't think of another major series of films that makes such an obvious leap. Without emotional investment in the source, I was utterly compelled by it – I remained swept up in the dystopian wold of the film; Jennifer Lawrence's central performance remains a strong, engaging and layered one; the supporting players are all decent, with a special poignant mention for the characteristically studied depth of Philip Seymour Hoffman.When the film does need to move into action sequences, it does so very well – the last major such passage being a standout, effectively inter-cut with dialogue and character. Therein lies these films' consistent strengths; these are blockbusters aimed at the vaunted young adult market which prove a timeless truth – that if a film (or book, or music, or) is constructed with enough intelligence and substance, there's no limiting the market. If this has lost the shock value of the first two films' central ideas, it's gained space to breathe and worm into the consciousness. We'll only be able to really judge if splitting the last instalment in two has worked this time next year; for now this may be the least immediately powerful of the three so far, but it's by no means a dip in the quality of the series.",7,5,19,1 December 2014
Hereditary," Promising, gripping and emotionally truthful - let down by an unsatisfying final act
","Hereditary is a divisive film that wears its influences and touchstones on its bloody sleeve. An arresting opening sequence as the camera draws in on the family home at the centre of the story - or is it one of the mother's (Toni Collette) model/dolls houses? - sets the tone for a film which constantly sews seeds of doubt in to our minds as to what's real and what's imagined. It's certainly absorbing, and for much of the run time there's a pervasive sense of creeping dread, with the occasional well-executed jump-scare. Half an hour into the film, with our attention taken up with one on-screen crisis the director throws in an out of nowhere gasp-inducing moment; did that really happen? Yes, it did. I shouted out loud when I saw it, alone at home on my laptop at 11 a.m. on a Friday morning; I can only imagine its power in a packed cinema. From there the film starts to explore some familiar thematic territory: maternal guilt, survivors guilt, PTSD, trauma and grief. The film is certainly, largely, emotionally and psychologically truthful as the central family's carefully constructed existence threatens to spiral out of control. Key to this is a captivating central performance from Toni Collette, whose swings from doting mother to something rather more disturbing form the film's core; one dinner table scene in particular is a brilliant portrayal of a family in grief grappling, and failing, to hold themselves together. Notice should also go to Gabriel Byrne as the on-screen father/husband; an understated, quiet performance that is an essential foil for everything to spin off from. The sound and production design throughout is brilliant; the subtle lighting playing with our sense of what may or may not be real. It's in the last 30 minutes that we either commit to the film's ideas or not, allowing its influences of Don't Look Now and (especially) Rosemary's Baby to have their head. For me it doesn't quite work; it feels like one homage too many in a film that nods at much but never quite finds its own identity. The Babadook was a more effective, less talked about, recent horror film on similar themes; the ending of which was perfectly in tune with the story and themes that had gone before The risks taken in Hereditary's last half hour ask us to accept something that is signalled throughout the film but doesn't quite convince. If the ending lived up to what had gone before, this would be a special film indeed; instead it's one to be admired and enjoyed, a sign of good things to come from this director, but ultimately a little unsatisfying.",7,1,2,1 April 2019
Casablanca," Brilliant, but you knew that.
","It's great, but you knew that. Lovely to see it on the big screen. It had been so many years since I'd seen it; all this time later I found Bogard a little inert. But Bergman really is extraordinary in this, isn't she? Performs in a way which makes me think of Elisabeth Moss today - does much with silence, so when she does speak, the character is well built.",8,1,2,1 May 2019
Rocketman," Works On Every Level - Despite My Lack Of Love For Elton's Music
","I really don't know how to quantify this; I have no great love for Elton John's music (though I do gladly acknowledge that Your Song is one of the most romantic songs ever written); I really don't like Taron Egerton's blank canvass acting. But this film still creeps in and worms into my emotions. It's a brave decision to play this film as a full-blown musical, complete with Elton John's back catalogue recast as a set of show tunes with accompanying choreography. There are some brilliant moments - the decision to tell the story in retrospect through an AA meeting (this film is very good on addiction, and it's refreshing to see a portrayal of a man with an eating disorder); there's a stunning sequence during the first American gig which perfectly captures that special moment of connection between performer and audience where a gig transcends to something truly elevating; there's a great supporting performance from Richard Madden; and for all my cynicism, Taron Egerton really can sing. For most of the film, I suspected emotional involvement was directly proportional to the viewer's love for Elton John's music, hence my sense of being impressed but unmoved most of the time. But towards the end come two striking emotionally cathartic moments; a moment of reconciliation between Elton's adult and childhood selves, and a wise decision to close with I'm Still Standing, a song. If the test of a musical biopic is to draw in and move those who don't love the music of the central character, this film works on every level; even if I retain a far greater affection for the dame director's earlier musical, Sunshine On Leith.",8,3,4,24 September 2019
The Death of Stalin," When is comedy inappropriate? A style of comedy that's an acquired taste; if your taste runs in darker hues you'll enjoy this
","How soon is too soon? Are there such things as subjects about which jokes should never be made?These are the questions that echo unavoidably in the mind long after the credits of The Death Of Stalin roll. Directed and written by Armando Iannucci, the British mind behind some of the best television satire over the last few years (most notably The Thick Of It and Veep), this film sees him bringing his observational, fly on the wall style of film-making to historical events as we observe the merciless behind the scenes jockeying for power in the wake of Satlin's death. The cast is a vast array of comic talent, and they're at their very best; Iannucci's style demands a lot of his actors, and they all rise to the challenge admirably. They wring every last moment of physical and verbal humour out of the script - make no mistake, you will laugh a lot during this film.But the appropriateness questions won't go away, These are events around which a lot of people died; and these are people who didn't care who suffered in the rush to power. Iannucci's thinking is in the deepest original satirical traditions - mock the devil, and he has no power left. It's also true that most of the darkness that is in the film is played straight; a counterpoint to the absurdity of surrounding events.It would be too simplistic, though, to suggest that this film doesn't have serious things to say, Most intelligent comedy has a lot to say - and Iannucci is nothing if not intelligent. The moment that's portrayed as leading to Stalin's death from a stroke is his mocking shock at a note smuggled to him, from the relative of a victim of one of his purges, promising revenge and 'praying for his death'. Iannucci wants to be on the side of the angels here, showing the suffering as getting some measure of justice.My own inclination has always been to say that there's nothing about which, in theory at least, a joke can't or shouldn't be made. What matters is context, content and intention. Here Iannucci seems to be satirising the amoral political power-grabs of people who care little for the consequences - a truth which is unavoidable in many a Westernised democracy in these days, the same Western democracies which have often been so quick to take the moral high ground over the Russian systems. For me this is a clever, funny, skilful film that only suffers slightly from a running time on the generous side. It put in me mind of writers like Aaron Sorkin, who slip moments of physical and wordplay comedy in to serious political situations; life is rarely all tragic or all comic. I told jokes in my eulogy at my father's funeral; the very best funerals in my professional experience of taking many of them, allow time for laughter as well as tears. But Iannucci's comedy is an acquired taste, and some won't be able to or want to stomach it. And that's fine; but if your tastes in comedy run a bit darker, then you'll find much to enjoy in this skilful and deft film.",8,0,0,24 February 2019
Se7en," Still dark and shocking, and inviting us to choose between despair and hope.
","Jaws - a film that is often credited with launching what we now know as the summer blockbuster phenomenon - is justly famous for many things. It's a masterpiece of slowly building fear, in part because the shark itself is unseen by the viewer for a long, long time. David Fincher's 1994 serial killer thriller takes inspiration from Spielberg's game-changer in that respect; we don't see the face of the killer until 30 minutes before the film's end, at a moment of revelation of his own choosing. Neither do we see the murders take place; in the film's memorable rain-sodden foot chase we only see his back; his face remains out of focus even when he's pointing a gun in Brad Pitt's face, deciding his fate. David Fincher knows what most good horror films and thrillers have made apparent over the years: the unseen is more threatening and frightening than the known.Rewatching this film for the first time in years in 2019, I'm struck especially by how normal the abnormal events it portrays are made to seem. A serial killer who bases his work on the seven deadly sins of Christian tradition is nothing especially original; religious references are a familiar serial killer trope. Fincher places this killing spree in the hands of an apparently ordinary figure - one who goes by the name of John Doe (the name given by American police to an unidentified deceased male). As John Doe himself says, as the film's unforgettable ending hoves into view: 'I'm not special; I've never been exceptional ... it's more comfortable for you to label me insane'.It's dangerous to quote the words of a killer as if they contain some kind of truthfulness, but this is the heart of the film: that evil is ubiquitous; it's in all of us. In each of the serial killer's victims, in the police chasing him, in the killer himself. In an age where the mass shootings that still stalk America are so routinely passed off as committed by someone with 'mental health problems', personal responsibility is avoided. The truth is we're all to blame; Se7en holds a mirror up to us, and it's not a pleasant sight. To summarise what John Doe says near the conclusion, we tolerate sin in ourselves and others because it's normal. It's this, it seems, that as the credits roll and those involved are left to live with the terrible consequences of their actions, that drives Morgan Freeman to utter the film's final words in voice over: 'Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.' It's a brutal way to leave the story, and one which the makers of the film fought the studio to keep in, and no less powerful for it; though now, having seen many more films than I had on seeing Se7en in the cinema, it seemed a tad too much of tell as opposed to show.This seems bleak - and it is, if we conclude that the fight of which Hemingway is speaking is fruitless. For those who believe following Jesus is worthwhile and eternally meaningful, it's a profoundly hopeful place to be; the world may not be as fine a place, as was intended; but there is a better way; and that better way will, eventually, be seen by all.It is a battle, though, and in the meantime many suffer. As long as any of us - like John Doe in this film - take matters in to our hands, take the judging as something for us to execute, then there will be casualties. Not least ourselves, but also those unfortunate enough to be in our orbit.All of which leads us to the Kevin Spacey question. With the revelations about his alleged sexual harassments and assaults, the question remains: should we watch his films? I have no easy answer here. I have been bullied to the point of suicide by someone who used to speak on big conference stages; I know how painful it was to see that person lauded by thousands when I knew different; I have forgiven the person, but still my stomach lurches with nausea and I'm wracked with anxiety if I see his name alluded to in a social media feed. I was sexually and physically abused as an adult by an adult; if I were to see her in a public role, it would be very hard to take. So I argue that Spacey's victims must be given much consideration here; I would want the same for myself. With that in mind, I rewatched Se7en for the first time since these allegations came out. As I reflected on the film's themes of the ubiquity of evil I found myself asking uncomfortable questions. If Spacey's past work is not to be considered any more; if my bully's speaking is no longer to be listened to; if my abuser is never to have a relationship ... then what of me? I have not done any of these things - but if I believe sin and evil are ubiquitous (and I do), then that means I'm as guilty of sin as anyone else. I hope I own my sins and seek forgiveness, in large part through the regular discipline of confession; but I also know I am prone to err. Let he who is without sin ...I do not have an answer, at least not yet. Certainly it seems to me that Spacey, and those like him, should not be widely spoken of or employed in the public eye - at the very least until fault has been admitted, responsibility taken and justice served. Fittingly for this film, for now I remain with this tension unresolved.What remains true is that it's still a beautifully constructed, chilling and gripping thriller that haunts and shocks even after all these years; even when I know the point to which the story is heading. More culturally significant films still lay ahead of Fincher, not least Fight Club; many would cite Zodiac (2006) as his best film; The Social Network (2010) tells at least part of the story of one of the era's dominant themes. Of course, we don't know what more is to come from him. Se7en sets the template for his best work: morally complex, darkly thrilling, and directed with a flair that fits the story and the theme. If not quite as dynamic as I remember, it's still a film to be reckoned with, that ultimately asks us to choose between despair and hope.",8,0,0,9 April 2019
Train to Busan," Hits All The Genre Tropes With Thrilling Aplomb, And Gives Food For Thought Also
","(ONE SLIGHT SPOILER)Genre movies can get a rough critical ride - if a movie, film, book or whatever - hits all the expected beats and notes one might expect, it's easily dismissed. It's said to have done nothing meaningful, to be derivative. But as long as we've been telling stories, genres have been important - they provide comfort and a structure to tell a story that we feel safe with and understand.Additionally, to dismiss genre art misses something very significant; many of humanity's greatest artists have worked within the strictures of the genre. Shakespeare is an example par excellence of this - most of his plays fit an established contemporary genre. What is exceptional in them is how he develops character and themes within these genres, whilst still pleasing those who came along for the comfort of the predictable (as well as the sublime language, of course).South Korea action-horror movie Train To Busan is a genre movie with the highest of high concepts: zombies on a train. If that doesn't get a horror-action fan's juices flowing, then little will. It's stark and efficient; as characters board a train, a zombie outbreak (the word is only used once in the film) hits the world outside and inside the train. The action sequences are visceral and thrilling; making full use of the train's geography, and the rare sequences outside the train work equally effectively without disrupting the claustrophobic, trapped tone.For the genre fan looking further, there's more to see. An incisive, satirically edged, take on the walls, customs and strictures we put around each other and others to protect our standing in families and societies.(slight spoiler)The fatal flaw of this zombie outbreak is that the zombies can only hunt what they can see. This means a couple of things - it adds some great wrinkles to action sequences when the train unpredictably enters or emerges from a tunnel, for example. But this idea also plays up the themes of the film, especially in the well-timed lull in advance of the film's final act as these ideas are given more space to breathe than in other similar films.A key plot moment in the last twenty minutes tries to present some redemption and hope; I'm not convinced it works tonally or plot-wise; the ultimate conclusion a necessary upbeat that unsurprisingly allows a sequel should box office permit (it did - a sequel is in production).It's not a perfect film, but this first live-action movie from the director promises much to watch with interest in years to come.",8,0,3,17 June 2019
Darkest Hour," Some Good Aspects Do Not Make Up For A Collection Of Lies And Half-Truths
","Myths don't have to be factually truthful; that's the whole point. At their best, myths take us to truths that are deeper than mere facts. At their worst, they sell us lies about ourselves; and lies are shifting sands to build a foundation on. In defence of myths, people will do the outrageous and the marvellous; and those who question myths often find themselves shouted down or, at the worst, dead.So to The Darkest Hour, Joe Wright's account of the short period of Churchill's premiership at the outset, through to Dunkirk (when, not coincidentally, the Brexit referendum was reaching fever pitch). Made around the same time as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, it's a very different film. Largely conventional, not without merit, but in many senses lazy and deceptive.Let's be clear. Gary Oldman is remarkable in the lead role; worthily recognised in awards, as with the remarkable prosthetic and make-up work that enabled him to be physically transformed. Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife is criminally underused, but still turns in a lovely performance, as she so often does. It's also moves along at a brisk and engaging pace, and is never dull despite the well-won paths of this slice of history.But it stops there. The film buys in to the Churchillian myth from the beginning - the divinely appointed (no, I'm not exaggerating; I've heard that said many a time) strong leader who led Britian, standing alone, to heroic victory. Churchill is often bathed in almost god-like light, especially when speaking in Parliament; his alcoholic drinking habits are largely passed off as eccentric indulgences; his near-bullying treatment of his secretary is mostly played for gentle laughs (especially empahsised by the none-too-subtle score). This is a Churchill who mostly brooks no dissenting voices despite appointing opposition politicians to his War Cabinet; who mocks the King behind his back (with whom he becomes friends at the convenient moment). Many shots are framed and lit as if they were historical portraits. It's all about the myth.The myth of British exceptionalism, which will like Churchill himself, remain unchallenged. There is no hint of irony when Churchill says that countries that fight on, rise strong; Britain spiralled in to decline for decades after the 2nd World War. At one point, a telegram sent by Churchill to an officer in the field is portrayed as worryingly close to the voice of God; and we all know you can't talk back to God (spoiler: you can, actually; but I hope I've read too much into that scene).As decision time to surrender or fight on approaches, Churchill takes a ride on the London Underground to gauge the will of the people. This never happened; but that's not necessarily a problem. Shakespeare makes it work, after all. But not here; it becomes an absurd process of Churchill asking blindingly obvious leading questions to a convenient cross-section of British society (in the space of one train stop), and everyone looks very happy and confident. Churchill then stretches the truth of that encounter to breaking point both with his own Cabinet and the House of Commons, in a moment of falsehood that would be enough for a vote of no confidence if any of it actually happened.And thus the Churchillian myth, embraced by Johnson and Trump alike, is bolstered one again; his racism not mentioned, his choices and character uncritiqued. Not to deny his great wartime achievement, of course; but this story needs better. For from this myth of Churchill summoning innate British independence and strength comes nationalistic isolationism, airbrushing of prejudice, and the excusing of anything as long as the ends serve the greater good (read: support the myth).It's not a bad film; it's decently entertaining and passed an afternoon in Covid Lockdown. It is, however, a film in service of a grandiose lie. And over-praised in service of lies can dangerous in times of crisis.",6,2,2,4 May 2020
Captain Marvel," Not bad, but not what it could have been either. Both the central character and the woman who plays her deserves better
","It's always a little unfair to judge a film against its supposed importance; but in cases like this it's inescapable. The MCU is a cultural phenomenon which shouldn't have taken as long as it has to give us a movie with a female lead character. It shouldn't have taken as long as it did to give us a black-led movie either, but Black Panther was in and of itself one of the best films of the series. In the DC universe, Wonder Woman was terrific. So where does this sit?In truth, I was a little disappointed; I'm by now a little bored of the origin story formula, and though this tried to depart from it somewhat, the whole film seemed to lack a distinctive identity. It tries to be about memory, and occasionally suggests some of the same techniques that T2: Trainspotting used to such great effect - but fails to develop them. The whole first two-thirds of the film is pretty slow going, and Jude Law is out of place in a part that signals the movie's core twist far too early. The story more successfully touches on issues of refugees and terrorism - asking questions about who the real enemies are - but again, this undercut by overly signalled twists.The final third is well put together; Brie Larson is a fine actor who fills the role admirably and deserves a stronger vehicle than this. There are some nice feminist nods - the destruction of the Arnie poster early has been mentioned many times, and is a powerful symbolic nod. But the film takes so long to deliver what it needs to. Ironically given the film's feminist position, it serves better as an origin story for Nick Fury (and his eyepatch); and the cat, of course, is a fine touch.The problem isn't the character of Captain Marvel - I want to see more of her, both in the Avengers and possibly even a film of her own. But it needs a film that doesn't try so hard to make me nostalgic for 90's music and a time when the otherwise excellent Annette Bening doesn't appear to have been made up to look like Hilary Clinton. It's not that it's a bad film; it's just a let-down, a disappointment, a sense of what could have been when compared to Black Panther and Wonder Woman. Captain Marvel needs better service than this.",7,1,3,5 April 2019
This Is the End," Woeful.
","This is what happens when people who don't understand narrative and post-modernism, and who have no self-awareness try to make a film that's post-modern and self-aware.

Passengers," Bland hokum
","Chris Pratt is out of his depth next to the always brilliant Jennifer Lawrence, who lifts every film she's in. The film turns on Chris Pratt's character waking Jennifer Lawrence from cryogenic sleep, and the ultimate love story at the film's heart leaves a disturbing possibility: it would be easy to read this film as a tract encouraging women to stay with abusive partners, given that Chris Pratt effectively murders Lawrence's character and she stays with him at the end. I'm prepared - just - to think better of it because Lawrence is an intelligent and powerful actress, but the film is ultimately ordinary with a bitter aftertaste. There are much better, and more thought-provoking, sci-fi love films out there.",5,0,1,27 October 2017
Us," Scary, chilling, head-scrambling, funny, satirical, profound, technically brilliant.
","Early in Quentin Tarantino's career it was hard to tell what type of film-maker he'd turn out to be. His early films were so soaked in pop culture references, sly allusions and dialogue about comic book characters and the like, that the task of decoding what, if anything his films were about was a largely fruitless one. It could be argued that we still don't know; we do know that he needs a more ruthless editor, but there seems to be little (if any) thematic consistency. Two films in to Jordan Peele's career, we know rather more. His films so far seem equally replete with pop cultural references; there's little sign of the ill discipline that has come to define Tarantino (though in Quentin's defence, Pulp Fiction was just the right side of baggy. Just.); and whilst we can see the fingerprints of Tarantino in, for instance, Peele's use of music, we can also see the larger themes he's reaching for. It helps that Peele is sticking to the horror genre; but taking Peele's calling card of Get Out and his second film Us together, it's apparent that he may well be one of the key film-makers of the era. He may also, it seems, be the prophet our times need.Whereas Get Out was clearly and obviously about race, Us could be about any number of things. Peele has been articulate about how this is in itself a breakthrough - a major film by a black film-maker with black leads that isn't about race shows, he says, a development in the conversation. The way Us appears to light up like a forcefield whichever of a number of themes you bring near it could be a weakness, and lead to a game of decoding that causes viewers to lose the power of the film's concerns; for me, that would be a mistake from the viewer rather than Peele, but I can see why it may be a problem.Let's be clear; Us is scary, funny, technically brilliant, stuffed with standout performances, and profound. Is it better than Get Out? Who knows. That seems a daft game to play. Like Get Out, you can decode any number of cultural and genre reference points; I'll throw one in to the ring I haven't seen mentioned (yet) - HG Wells's 'The Time Machine', the science-fiction book that more or less created the time travel sub-genre. The influence here isn't in time travel; but rather, to me, in something hinted at in the film's opening shot that becomes a central part of the film's plot. I'll say no more on that for fear of spoilers.It's an adrenaline ride, for sure. A home invasion movie, a doppelgÃ¤nger movie, a family in crisis drama, a slyly satirical/comic take on and deconstruction of the American dream, consumerism, capitalism, celebrity charity drives (prefiguring the Insta-charity brigade); it touches too on animal testing. Like many horror movies it looks at the consequences of early trauma on later life, throwing in a dose of imposter syndrome for good measure.For me it says most about privilege. During apartheid in South Africa, the governing party banned any art that would be deemed to subvert their rule. Sometimes they missed the point. Bright Blue's song 'Weeping' snuck through, because it appeared to be a song about a man with noisy neighbours. It was, of course, a parable; a parable about the way white South Africa kept the rest of the country at bay. In the words of the song, in the quest for peace and order, the threat of the angry underclass was stifled. The mistake made was that what they thought was anger, wasn't; it was weeping. But if the weeping remained unheard for too long, it may well turn to anger.That's the thematic territory that Us seems to me to tread. As the moneyed classes bury themselves in consumption and comfort, an underclass is increasingly alienated, and increasingly desperate. The underclass might be seen as angry; in fact they are weeping. But when the weeping is unheard, and instead patronised and then forced to continue to pay the price of the privileged's comfortable life, we watch it eventually turn to blood-soaked, murderous anger.It should go without saying that, controversies about accents notwithstanding, Lupita Nyong'o's central performance is remarkable; each cast member who's asked to play two versions of the same character is similarly terrific. Elisabeth Moss is superb in her supporting role, which does not give her enough to do (but in fairness, no film gives an actress of her remarkable talents enough to do). There are jump scares to rival most, but it's the chilling, creeping dread and the final, head-scrambling twist that lives in your (sub) conscious for days after. It has what may be the bleakest final shot since Frank Darabont's The Mist, made bearable by the film's well-judged wit and laugh out loud tension-breaking.As with Get Out, Peele is tackling one of our era's most urgent issues, calling us to listen and act before it's too late. Whilst churches squabble, politicians drown in self-interest and celebrity culture demands its tribute, Jordan Peele may well be the prophet our times urgently need. Maybe many won't give credence to that, soaked as his horror stories are in blood and fear; but therein lies the challenge.

Knives Out," An Absolute Blast
","When news broke that RenÃ©e Zellweger was cast as Bridget Jones, I remember mutterings and complaints from British critics and audiences; couldn't an up and coming British actor have been given such the opportunity? What sort of mess would the American make of the accent? Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were cast opposite her and despite the complaints and suspicions, the film was a huge hit, spawned sequels and it now seems rather quaint to think about these complaints at all.This was in the back of mind approaching Knives Out. Director Rian Johnson directs a starry American cast (and Daniel Craig, sporting an occasionally inconsistent Southern accent) in a film he also wrote that was to be a homage to the British murder mystery in general and Agatha Christie in particular. I could imagine some of the genre most loyal fans getting uptight about an American take on British traditions, but I hadn' t heard many of these complaints - may be, Brexit and Trump notwithstanding - we're all a bit more internationally-minded now.In any case, it really doesn't matter. Knives Out is a blast. The plot is a finely constructed work of crystalline beauty; each performance from the stellar cast is given at least a few moments in the sun; the denouement has more than one 'aha!' moment as revelations fall into place; and there are more laugh out loud moments than in many comedies, all of which occur without taking the viewer out of the moment, undercutting the drama. To cap it all, the film also works - and is clearly intended to, especially in light of the ending - as a metaphor for how immigration and precisely the sort of nationalism which turned its nose up at the thought of an American Bridget Jones; but it's not a metaphor that dominates the film, nor is it an overtly political one.What it is, is a very, very entertaining film which has - if those who need to say yes to such things do so - the clear capacity to produce a sequel or three. It's one of those films likely to be enjoyed by people who don't go to the cinema, to be discussed over Christmas dinner (rather than the politics), to be curled up with in a couple of years in the week between Christmas and New Year.",8,5,11,4 December 2019
"I, Tonya"," A Mixture Of Jarring And Brilliant
","There's much to enjoy here - especially Allison Janney's and Margot Robbie's towering performances as mother and daughter. I was also struck by the cinematography of the skating sequences, which was visceral and beautiful at the same time. I was disquieted by the tone, however; I can understand the comedic edge, given the essential absurdity of much that happened. But when that comedy plays round, and occasionally bleeds over in to, the edges of elements of the story of domestic violence, it jars and feels distasteful. It can sometimes seem to be the work of middle-class people sneering and giggling at the lives of 'the others'.",7,1,1,28 May 2019
Interstellar," A thrillingly, gloriously flawed film with big ideas that demands to be seen.
","Big budgets and creativity don't often go together. Limitations force us to be creative, to think and plan and dream; effectively unlimited resources too often mean a death to original thinking and problem-solving. Director Christopher Nolan may just be proving himself to be an exception to this rule: his smaller, early films like Memento and The Prestige are creative, intriguing, involving and engaging; all qualities found in mega-budget Inception and the occasion he was handed the reins of that most precious of commercial enterprises, Batman (in the form of his trilogy Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises). All of these are films which throw spectacle as well as ideas at the viewer, expecting the audience to work as well as be wowed.Interstellar is the synthesis of this, a dizzying spectacle almost impossible to describe or articulate. It's science-fiction set in a future where humanity's food sources are dwindling out- of-control; a solution must be found elsewhere. What follows involves space-travel, space-ships and some very big philosophical and scientific ideas.If all that sounds like the stuff of fan-boy culture, you'd be doing yourself and the film a grave dis-service; the opening act is earth-bound and centred around what becomes the film's key relationship – father-daughter. For all the hyper-reality and wow factor that follows, this is seeking to be a very human story.Watching Interstellar and then trying to form a coherent opinion of it is like trying to self- diagnose after beaten about the head by one of Pacific Rim's gargantuan robots. That's not to suggest the film is clumsy; it's that it's so overwhelming, so expansive, so  big  that you're left grasping for a response that actually does justice to the experience of seeing the film. It's far from perfect – the script is clunky, at times giving in to some laboured plot exposition; it sometimes feels like a blessing that the sound mix is such that some lines are near-drowned out by Hans Zimmer's intense, searing score. That means that the actors don't really shine; especially those with a lot to do. The best performances are more to the fringe than the centre – especially striking is Mackenzie Foy as the 10-year old daughter, carrying an emotionally laden part that's vital to the plot and the especially the film's first third with a disarming ease. Nolan regular Michael Caine is on fine form; Matthew McConaughey struggles gamely with the inadequate script in the central role, and comes up short.The film wants to ask big questions of the nature of reality, belief and existence; questions so big that it's impossible to articulate them properly even in a near-three hour running time. It's also trying to hymn the human capacity for the extraordinary; it does that successfully, with room to spare. For me however, it runs that alongside a deep awareness of humanity's over- arching arrogance, capacity for self-destruction and the ability to ignore that which is self- evident. For all the wonder, the film never feels naive or misty-eyed.In the end, it's an essential, flawed experience; one of the few films that can tip such obvious references to works of the scope of 2001: A Space Odyssey and not seem ridiculous; that's big enough in vision to ignore the lazy temptations of a third-dimension; the reach of which exceeds its grasp but somehow that's all part of the experience, exactly appropriate for what the film is portraying.Christopher Nolan has made many all-round better films, and will make more; but he will not make one that does such full justice to the purpose and experience of cinema as an art form. Neither will he make one as satisfying in its vision despite its failures; nor is it likely that any film, Nolan's or anyone's, will make you feel the way this will. It demands to be seen on a screen big enough to do justice to its ambition and scope.",8,0,2,13 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Lazy And Overlong
","I don't love the Star Wars films the way some do; I saw them as a child, I enjoyed them, and I bought a few related toys. But they never retained the place in my affection they have for some. With the 9-film cycle now concluded with this film, I look back and count a total of 3 decent films; let's be honest, 33% is not a great hit rate (Return Of The Jedi, and the first two films in this latest trilogy). This one takes all that was good about the previous episode and tramples all over it with bad story-telling, a whole load of deus ex-machina that reach the level of absurd, and some decent performances struggling to make themselves heard above the din. I'm kind of glad it's all over, to be honest.",6,13,27,20 April 2020
Bird Box," Engaging and entertaining, if never quite fulfilling its potential despite Sandra Bullock's excellent performance
","There's been some strong opinions expressed about this film; the heat around it seems to have been ratcheted up by Netflix telling us it's their most viewed original release, equivalent to massive box office had it been given a cinematic release. I also can't help but feel some of the online vitriol would have been lesser had it not been both directed by and starred women. Either way, it comes as little surprise to discover that it's not as bad as some of the hate directed towards it suggests. It doesn't benefit from thematic and plot similarities with the superior A Quiet Place. It's set in a - you guessed it - dystopian future where a glimpse of ... something we never see ... leads the individual who sees it to immediately commit suicide. The film takes place in two different time streams - one in the immediate aftermath of the crisis hitting one city, in which the pregnant Sandra Bullock is caught up. The other is five years on, with that same mother and two children (named 'Boy' and 'Girl') attempting to make their way on a raft down a river to a possible safe haven. It's never less than engaging, and Sandra Bullock is superb as she channels a potent cocktail of spoken and unspoken paranoia, fear, insecurity and maternal feelings into a race for survival. There are false notes - John Malkovich is either badly miscast or very badly written (probably both) as a grumpy survivor of the initial crisis. In that same time frame, the dystopian trope of whether incomers to the group should be trusted is never convincingly handled. On the plus side, one of those outsiders is Tom Holland, an actor capable of great complexity and always one I relish watching; his part is engagingly handled. The main weakness is, though, that the film can't quite decide what it wants to be: a horror-thriller, a film for adults, a film accessible to children, a film about family and specifically motherhood, a survival thriller, a reflection on our fear of mental health issues ... or more. It takes no central decision, so several thematic threads are frustratingly left hanging; the outstanding, leaner A Quiet Place settled on the horror-thriller format and in doing so found profound expression for its themes, even given a shorted running time. As a result, Bird Box's emotional pay off at the end doesn't quite take flight, and the film's titular metaphor feels clumsy. But still; I was never bored, and Sandra Bullock's performance is worth it on its own.",7,0,1,19 February 2019
The Revenant," Awe-inspiring, but not a masterpiece; a hard to love work of a master, with questions to answer.
","I've heard tell of children in the urban West who don't know that milk comes from cows. They've never seen a cow; they just can't see the connection. I don't know if it's an (urban) myth, but it makes a point about the increasingly urbanised nature of our lives. We're cut loose from our roots and rhythms; we have established new ones in the urban contexts, but we're no longer creatures of the earth and dust. The Revenant is a counterpoint to this, a film more in touch with the nature of ... nature ... you could not expect to see. From Alejandro González Iñárritu, the Oscar winning director of Birdman and staring Leo DiCaprio, it tells the story of an 1820s American frontiersman left for dead by his colleagues as he struggles to recover from a bear mauling. It's a brutal, visceral tale of survival and, though this only really comes to the fore in the film's final act, a quest for revenge. Many have said it's brutal - and it is. The Revenant's portrayal of the natural world is of one red in tooth and claw; physical, weighty and oppressive. There are very few concessions to CGI - apart from in the bear attack itself, which is understandable, but doesn't detract from the sequence's extraordinary impact. DiCaprio's character - and the actor himself, presumably - really suffer here. Bones crack, joints grind; winds sweep and howl; cold seeps into every crevice; food is gleaned from the land and from dead animals. The cinematography is nothing short of extraordinary; the cold colours gleam with a tangible frozen bite; the takes are long and fluid, following the movie's central character to emphasise that he's stalked as much by the forces of the land as by his own mortality or people who would do him harm. There's a spirituality here. It's a spirituality of the Native American cultures, one wedded deeply to the earth from which the people draw their life. Tellingly the only reference to Western spirituality is a ruined church being overrun by the elements; the only way DiCaprio's character is going to survive his trial by snowbound fire is abandoning everything he knows - including any semblance of familiar faith - and embrace a mode of being that's at once hostile and essential for survival.Contemporary Christianity has much to learn here. As our planet becomes increasingly urbanised we lose our connection to the rhythms of the pastoral life from which we have drawn our roots. That's not a bad thing - nor a good thing - in itself. It necessitates a reinvention, though; a rediscovery of theology, spirituality and worship that connects to the way we live and is true to who we are and who we find ourselves to be. Sections of the church are wrestling with this; but some still run, crying about heresy or lost tradition. All the while, people thirst for lack of vision.Back to the movie. DiCaprio - for me one of the most underrated actors of his generation - is magnificent here. He's as physical here as he was to very different ends in The Wolf Of Wall Street; long stretches of this film pass wordless, his body and face speaking volumes. He can be a remarkable actor, and his lack of major awards recognition demonstrates how conservative awards judges like to be. They do like their talent to suffer for their art, though, and that alone will probably ensure trophies on this occasion. It's a good, remarkable film. It's not - I suspect - a great one. My sense is that it will not translate so powerfully to the myriad smaller screens on which films are now viewed post cinema release. I may be wrong, but it feels as if the film relies so much for its power on overwhelming you with the beauty and hardness of the environment that the small screen will shrink it in more ways than one. In this era, a great film needs to be great on screens big and small; I suppose we'll all just have to watch it on our phones to answer that one. There are other problems with this film - and the director's work in general. The biggest of these is his treatment of women. Here the women are off-stage, in memory, or a victim of violent rape. They have precious few lines. In the context of a career thus far where his films largely focus on the masculine in different expressions, this gives cause for concern. The director has questions to answer, and they can't simply be answered by saying that what he produces is very good in its own terms. It is; but in the era he's working, he needs to do more with half the human race.The Revenant is remarkable, thrilling, stimulating - and ultimately hard to love. For all that's impressive and awe-inspiring about it (and I use the word awe in its religious context), it's not going to lodge in the heart; it fed my soul, but if I tried to live on it I'd be in trouble.",8,1,2,30 January 2016
Coriolanus," Lots of guts, tension and drama; short on heart.
","Coriolanus is a long way from being one of Shakespeare's most accessible plays. The Roman plays in general have a not entirely fair reputation for being full of long speeches and low on plot; it's tempting to meet the title with a shrugged 'who' (or 'what'?); it's not a very regularly performed play anyway, so it doesn't have many opportunities to make a bid for the limelight. So on the face of it this is strange choice of material for Ralph Fiennes on his directorial debut; especially when you consider that he's also the star. In Fiennes and his adapter's hands the play becomes a sleek, streamlined political drama with visceral action sequences Transported to 'a place calling itself Rome' that plays more like a wartime Bosnia. Coriolanus is heroic general, feted with praise and encouraged, or forced, by his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) to seek the powerful position of Consul. He finds himself unable to play the political games with the people required to get the post; his anger on not getting the position leads to a riot and exile. In exile he forms an alliance with former enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) in order to take revenge. It's a tense and gripping watch; the new setting lends greater immediacy and sense of threat, the edits give clean lines a plot that fairly zips along. The action sequences are fine; not outstanding, but suitably brutal to maintain the law of the jungle sense of ancient Rome. The air is suffused with testosterone, with men not backing down from each other. The female characters are cleverly dressed to look more military, if not masculine then at the least not emphasizing femininity. This is a male environment, with the smoke of combat never far away. That approach explains the choice of Gerard Butler for the role of Tullus; which would make sense if he didn't appear so dramatically out of his depth. He alone amongst the cast doesn't seem comfortable with the language, brooding too much and forgetting to back-up his physical presence with words that are threatening or venomous. Which is a huge contrast to Fiennes in the lead role. Battle-scarred and, for most of the film, bloodied, when he's not fighting he's a caged tiger. It's clear why men will follow him into battle; haranguing bullet-ridden corpses for a lack of commitment, his men fight for and with their leader. It makes sense of his unwillingness to stay around to hear the story of his exploits; this is a man of deeds, not words. When he's finally bought face-to-face with his estranged family in a climactic showdown he's largely silence, trying to keep a crumbling facade in place.Which all works well as far as plot and the themes of power and alpha masculinity go, but does mean that the film has precious little emotional heft; even in a denouement which should at the least brush the heart, it becomes more of an action movie showdown with much better dialogue. It seems a hard criticism, but ultimately it's the fruit of the understandable choices made with the plot and style of the film. The updating convinces; the drama grips; the action impresses. It's just a shame there's not more heart to go with all the guts.",7,3,6,12 April 2014
The Intouchables," Funny and touching, but not all it could or should be.
","A French-language based on a true story drama, The Intouchables is ... touching ... but not as good as it likes to think it is. In the mind of its creators it seems to be a comic drama of immense human significance; in reality it is powerful and affecting and funny at different times. It's also clichéd, patronising and predictable. It's the story of a rich, privileged quadriplegic man who needs to hire a new carer. He picks a young man with no qualifications and no experience from the Paris housing projects. What follows is a predictable but still effective clash of cultures and expectations, with mutual learning taking place on both sides of the divide. The films seems at pains to not offend with its sensitive subject matter, the overall effect seeming to be at times patronising to the poor and the disabled alike. All poor people like hip-hop, it seems; all the rich, classical music. The quadriplegic man struggles to feel, you see. Yes, really. All a bit trite at times. At others is affecting though. It chimed with me at points; it encourages an engaging, counter- cultural lack of safety and wisdom the better to actually build meaningful lives and relationships, to break artificial barriers and self-limitations. It's encourages a kind of holy recklessness on its viewers, that you suspect will get lost amidst the worthiness for many. If only the film itself had shown a little more danger and a little less safety, we could have had something more special and less crowd-pleasing.",6,12,24,30 December 2014
Yesterday," Funny But Ultimately Lacks Something Crucial
","If I had a desert island director, it would be Danny Boyle. I can't say the same for Richard Curtis in the writers' department, but that's not to say I don't like many of his films. But on many levels they seem to be an odd fit for each other - Boyle loves to put his audiences through a tough journey to reach any sort of emotional journey. With Richard Curtis, it's all about enjoying a ride we more or less know the route of from the beginning. When Curtis is good, he's very good; when he's bad ... we'll, he writes The Boat That Rocked. The two of them coming them together for Yesterday - a feelgood romantic comedy around the music of The Beatles, which can be remembered by only one person in the world - is enough to make me worry that we'll be landed with a film which is neither Curtis-enough nor Boyle-enough.That's pretty much what this film ends up being. There are plenty of charming, laugh-out-loud, Curtis moments. There's some of Boyle's style and social commentary. What we don't have any of - and it's crucial to the success of the film - is light-footed whimsy and charm. Both Curtis and Boyle can produce that, but neither of them does so here as if they're both saying 'After you'. There's some fine performances; Ed Sheeran, as himself, is especially funny (I say that as someone who really doesn't like his music); it's to Sheeran's credit that he's willing to satirise himself.The music is, of course, magnificent; Himesh Patel in the central role carries them off with aplomb - his song renditions are often electrifying. It's just that ultimately this film is neither one thing nor the other.",7,0,2,19 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Far from flawless, but no less significant for all that
","Has a mass-market blockbuster ever opened on such a downer as this one? Infinity War's ending made anything else impossible, of course, but what one expects from such a major movie is not an hour or so of a whole set of characters learning to live with loss and grief. It's to the movie's immense credit that this sustained so long, and so well handled, to the extent that the occasional flashes of Marvel humour in that segment of the film don't seem out of place. Occasionally we pan out to the big picture and global scale of the loss. One character saying 'I miss the Mets' brings you up short; so many have died that, even 5 years later, professional sports can not function. Another powerful moment is a scene that takes in a monument bearing the names of some of The Vanished - the monument seems endless.As well as this is handled, this wasn't my major concern ahead of the film. That revolved around what Endgame was going to do about the overwhelming loss of Infinity War. Science-fiction/fantasy stories run in to trouble, stretching credibility even in terms of their own worlds (which is the only credibility that really matters), when they get out of a narrative tight spot or emotional downbeat by pressing some kind of metaphorical 'reset button'; what happened didn't really happen, or is just undone. I feared even further when the proposed solution in Endgame started to be unpacked. In a manner of speaking, I was right to worry about this. A metaphorical reset button is pressed, but it's done in a deft way; the journey to that point is fraught with real loss that can't be undone, not to mention a bravura trip back through various points in some of the movies that have bought to this point, with scenes replayed from new angles (to say much more would be to risk too much of a spoiler). Both of these choices are well handled; as ever, this series mostly manages the dance between humour and sadness with great dexterity.The major loss of the film was genuinely moving; other losses, less so. When you have a series of films that has (so far) lasted 11 years and 21 films, and introduced (according to Wikipedia) 226 characters, there's only so much attachment one can build up to many of them. Plus I'm old, and I forget things. This is especially so in one key plot strand that ends with 2 characters having to resolve which of them will sacrifice for the other. It's a powerful moment, but to be honest I just didn't care enough about them to really be moved by what could have been a landmark moment.Much has been made in the last year or so of Marvel introducing its first film led by a black character (the excellent Black Panther) and a woman (the good but not outstanding Captain Marvel); these were indeed significant cultural moments. Endgame undercuts them somewhat by disappointingly sidelining them both for most of the film; admittedly, in the case of Captain Marvel at least, this may be as much to do with working out a reason for her immense powers not to be the solution to every problem. Even so, it doesn't really work for me; in the movie's defence in this regard, however, my 10-year old, previously superhero averse, daughter sat through it all without a toilet break or complain not once, but twice, because 'The girls kick butt!'; which is certainly true of some less central female characters.Two performances stand out for me: Josh Brolin as Thanos is brilliant, managing to imbue such a cosmic villain with pathos. Paul Rudd (Ant Man) is, for me, one of the least appreciated parts of the MCU, and his performance is superb here; great comic moments, and an occasional cypher for the more casual viewer who needs to be caught up to events. In addition, any moment in which Taika Waititi gets to give voice to his flawless comic timing as the voice of Korg is a good one; more of that, please.It's striking how little action there is for such a film; to be honest, this strained the running time for me. I think the middle third could have been contracted a little; it lagged at times. But I seem to be in a minority on that, as my daughter testifies above. For me it also suffers a little from 'Return Of The King' syndrome; there were several occasions when I thought it had finished (and wanted it to end), but another coda came along. Yes, there are a lot of character arcs to tie up; but it this is a film where neither the big picture nor micro narrative arcs are entirely smooth or neat, and the last 30 minutes or so dragged. What should have been a touching final scene for one character (and indeed the film) felt like blessed relief; other narrative developments earlier in the film were all but accompanied with a knowing nod to camera. The latter would at least have felt more in tune with the series' tone. The climactic battle isn't handled brilliantly either; there's too much going on with too many for me to really keep track of what's happening; a common fault of superhero films (Black Panther being one of the notable exceptions). I'm thinking that in this regard the makers could have learned from the flawless execution of the massed battles in the Lord of The Rings films.These are small complaints in context. We do need to take a moment to acknowledge the Marvel achievement here; when the first Iron Man movie kicked this all off 11 years ago, none of us really knew what would happen. None of us expected what has transpired; a multi-stranded, complex, overlapping set of blockbusters that (largely) standalone for the causal viewer, bring in new fans with no loyalty to the comic books (like me) and serve the hardcore fans also. To reach this point of the project and to do so as one of the biggest films of all time, with the confidence to inflict real loss on its characters and audience, is a unique cinematic achievement which, for all the faults in this film or any others in the series, is something likely to never be equalled. If anyone ever says again that modern attention spans are too short and people don't really like complex stories any more, that conversation can be ended with the sample of the Marvel films (and Game of Thrones); all we need is characters we care about, and we remain capable of following even the most complex of plots. Remember these films are serious hits amongst people much younger than me, with a far greater grasp of the narrative complexities spread over all the films. In that respect little has changed since story-telling began.There are themes and ideas to mine from this movies, and all that's gone before. Some of them will sit long in the mind, some of them give merely a fleeting suggestion. In all honesty, to really mine and understand those I'll need to revisit them all over a more condensed period of time; Endgame is certainly a film that you enjoy with a relatively limited engagement of the preceding films, but the experience will be all the richer in relation to the viewer's familiarity with the breadth of the context. For now, we come to an end that is also a rest, and a pause. We all need to take a breath.",7,3,6,9 May 2019
The Favourite," Wonderful, and weird, in every respect.

28 Days Later...," 17 Years Later ... Less Scary, But More Disturbing
","Sometimes an experience of watching a film outweighs the quality of the film itself. The first time I saw 28 Days Later ... might have been one of those. My wife and my friend Andy saw it at a late night showing in the wonderful Stratford Picture House in the East End of London on a summer's night in 2002, in the first week of its release. A packed cinema was scared to within an inch of itself; Andy cycled home alone through London's by then deserted streets, a journey he still talks about with the hushed tones of one who never quite felt safe the whole journey. The next morning, England played bitter rivals Argentina in the football World Cup in Japan/South Korea; London came to a standstill during the game, during which my wife drove through empty streets to a meeting; streets eerily reminiscent of the film's famous scenes. Since then the film has acquired near-mythic status for me; a film by my favourite director that was so good and so frightening I couldn't revisit it.Until this day in 2019, a whole 17 years later. It's remarkable how much of the film I could remember clearly - it really had imprinted itself on me. The post-prologue scenes of Cillian Murphy's character wondering an empty central London remain astonishing and chilling; and as throughout the film, we are reminded here that Danny Boyle is a director who really knows how to use music. The atmosphere of dread is palpable, a sense that is more long-lasting and all-encompassing than the many effectively executed jump scares. Whilst the low budget is occasionally uncomfortably visible, the skewed camera angles and deliberately disordered shot compositions add to a sense of disorientation and surreality. The film is questioning: what's normal anyway? Who gets to say?Harries and Murphy are both excellent in the central roles; Christopher Eccleston's accent is further disorienting to those familiar with him from other work, throwing us further off centre when the reveal of his group's real agenda finally comes. Whilst the script does creak and strain under expository weight on occasions, the most disturbing moment comes in Eccleston's 'Slow down' aside to one of his men, the moment it starts to dawn on viewer and protagonist alike how far humanity has fallen in little more than a month, how completely the 'normal' order of things has broken down. These revelations, and the moment when Harries' character watches the wrath executed by Murphy's in the film's closing action sequences (a final act shot through with the tropes of slasher and haunted house movies) point to something else, something we might now term concern about toxic masculinity. In the film's coda, Murphy whispers to Harries, sewing the dress she'd been earlier forced to wear, 'You know, you looked alright in that'; he may not be Infected, but it's possible he carries a similar virus. There are strong suggestions throughout that the Infected look for revenge on the living, but there's enough suggested in sub-text throughout the film to leave us wondering who the really dangerous ones are.The legacy of this film is significant. It consolidated Murphy and Harries as significant actors in their own right; it turned out to be at the forefront a rebooting of the zombie story to the forefront of popular culture, a wive we're still riding today; most importantly, it relaunched the stellar and varied career of Danny Boyle which was threatening to disappoint after the misfires of The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary. For that, I'm thankful - Danny Boyle's films have rarely failed to speak to me and change me. 17 years on from first viewing, this film did again; less scary, perhaps, but more disturbing and relevant to today's gender discourse than perhaps many of us realised.",8,3,4,27 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Typically Tarantino, Both For Better And Worse.
","As with most Tarantino films, for me this had much to admire, some things that annoyed me, at least one thing that angered me (not in a good way), and confirmed yet again that he badly needs someone who will tell him to just edit it down, for goodness sake.

Behind The Candelabra," Solid, interesting, but unspectacular
","An HBO-originated made for TV movie that received a deserved cinema release, this Steven Soderbergh directed film tells the story of Liberace's long affair with the much younger Scott Thorson, right up to and beyond the eventual death of the pianist. Even viewed on TV, as I did, it doesn't come off like a TV movie; Steven Sodebergh's efficient and composed direction marks this out as worth attention. However it doesn't really go to the depths worthy of the film's outstanding central performances (Michael Douglas as Liberace, Matt Damon as the lover). Liberace is pretty much as you expect the celebrity to be in this sort of story - initially attractive and engaging, then increasingly unpredictable and selfish. Scott Thorson is also as you expect the lover to be: star-struck, naive, enjoying the material benefits of his affair and eventually bitter, angry but still harbouring tender feelings. The narrative never feels quite engaging enough to grip or move; it's more of a genre piece, really - of rich prince and commoner lover lifted above his station. I was never really moved by it - fascinated, maybe; informed, potentially. However without a real interest in Liberace as an individual or artist, it didn't move above average. To say it's not a TV movie isn't a value judgement; it's a substance statement, describing the nature of the beast we're watching. What we're watching is a decent, but unspectacular glimpse into the faded glories of the over-privileged and under-loved.",6,0,3,5 January 2015
Beasts of No Nation," A brilliant, urgent and overlooked film
","I watched this on Netflix (where it exclusively available). It's the story of a child soldier fighting a civil war in an unnamed African country (filmed in Ghana). It's terrific. It features two wonderful performances. One from Idris Elba, as the commander of the boy soldiers, transforming them from children to killers; he's terrifyingly charismatic, and really makes you believe the relationship between him and his chargers. The second is from Abraham Attah as the boy at the heart of it all, taking us on a mesmeric and heartbreaking journey. Horrifying as it is, we are spared many of the real horrors of war whilst still letting us feel the impact of the atrocities on both victims and perpetrators. The cinematography brings the colours of the bush to life, the dust almost seeping under your fingernails as you watch; the music is beautiful and, along with the almost at times poetic script, this both offsets and points up the horror of events portrayed. It's a brilliant and urgent film, without a white saviour in sight, which Netflix (who put up the money for the production when it was threatened with going under) are to be commended for taking a risk on it. The reasons for it being overlooked in awards is obvious and twofold - endemic racism in the film industry and fear of the future as a streaming service trumps the film's very limited cinema release. If you have Netflix, search it out; if you don't, it's one of many good reasons to fork out for a subscription.",9,2,2,21 October 2017
Gone Girl," A dark, delciously enjoyable parable of modern relationships
","Why are you reading this?Do you trust my opinion, or is it simply passing the time?Do you want to find out what's going on in my head, or is it a way of helping you form your own opinion? That's a glimpse inside the world of Gone Girl. It's a parable of contemporary relationships that consistently destabilises the narrative direction; that portrays intimate relationships as minefields of (dis)trust and self-justification; in which there's scarcely a single sympathetic character but still has the gall to ask you where your sympathies lie ... and why. Directed by David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac) and adapted from her own novel by Gillian Flynn it's best understood as a neo-Gothic melodrama/thriller. Yes, really. The film opens on the morning of Nick and Amy's 5th wedding anniversary; Amy goes missing in suspicious, possibly violent circumstances. The finger of public and police suspicion starts to turn on Nick, and we see the truth unfold in parallel with the flashback story of Nick and Amy's relationship from the day they first met. It's hard to say much more than that without spoilers. So though I've tried to avoid any, proceed in the rest of this post with caution; I hadn't read the book, and managed to avoid spoilers. From the point of view of pure plot, it is a deliciously dark thriller, constantly taking the truth and twisting it just out of the viewer's reach. In the final sections the film turns into strange territory, but that it does so without ever feeling false is a measure of just how good this film is. David Fincher is on top form here, meticulously constructing every scene and narrative beat with a painter's eye; the performances - especially Rosamund Pike as Amy and Tyler Perry as Nick's lawyer - are pretty much on the money; and the film is shot with a sheen and style appropriate to the film's themes. It nods to all sorts of films - from Hitchcock, through Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct and in one startling moment, Carrie - yet is definitively its own vision. For all that, the film demands more from you. It has a dark vision of human relationships, and more or less forces the viewer into some uncomfortable reflections. For me the film touches genius in making you to pick a side; then undercuts that by showing you how shallow it is to do so. There's a question around the source novel as to if it's misogynist or feminist; such a debate may miss the point completely, in fact. Truth isn't to be found on one 'side' or the other; it's to be found in the combustible chemical reaction of two broken people. In the film's deliberately over-stated central relationship we see writ large a deeper truth; that the sum of a relationship is greater than its constituent parts. Hence the uncomfortable reality the film leaves us with - give yourself to your relationships; don't hide. The more you hide, the more exposed you are. The less you give, the more you lose; the more you give, the more you gain. It's not just relationships in Gone Girl's cross-hairs; it's a scathing attack on celebrity culture, on media obsession with making info-tainment out of personal tragedy (it felt apt to see this film in the week that Oscar Pisotrius was sentenced for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp), gender and domestic violence, and parenting. It needs a hearty running time to do all that without collapsing under its own weight. It is a long film, but necessarily so; it flies by. Mind, heart and eyes are fully engaged throughout. In the end, however, it's the nature of intimate relationships with which it is most concerned. For all the heightened reality that is a feature of this and Fincher's other best work, it leaves you with pertinent and uncomfortable choices to make and questions to answer. It's impossible to come out of this film and not find yourself sitting in judgement one character or the other; analyse that for long, though, and you find the finger pointed back on yourself. Which is what a parable should do, really.",9,2,11,15 October 2014
Frozen," Good stuff, but not up there with the Toy Story trilogy
","Moving countries is a sure way to put all sorts of parts of your psyche to the test. The new culture(s), the change in weather patterns, missing your favourite café or radio station or park, the relationships to build .. all of these and so much more splash around the surfaces of the consciousness. You are out-of-place: you know it, others know it. It's obvious. When we moved to South Africa nearly 5 years ago we experienced all of this. It felt like we were constantly missing out on something. It's not so much destabilising as it is the creation of a whole new identity. Much of what you had become accustomed to building around you as part of your sense of self is gone and you have to do it all over again. One of the things I discovered I was missing out on was a name for this experience of missing out on things. I don't know if it's especially popular in this country or this part of this country, but I kept hearing and noticing 4 letters as part of speech. FOMO. It sounded like the name of a music festival; it would be casually slipped into a conversation and the locals would laugh. 'FOMO! Ahh...' Like the new car I hadn't seen before, it was suddenly everywhere. It stands for Fear Of Missing Out, and apparently it's a thing. I don't know where it came from and I'm not especially keen on finding out, but some people were having counselling or prayer ministry to deal with their FOMO. I was missing out on missing out. Another area I was missing out on had nothing to do with moving to South Africa, but has more to do with the fact that my wife and I don't have children. Though we both love films, this does mean that we tend to avoid seeing films that are aimed at more of an all-age audience and tend to concentrate on more 'adult' fare. (no, not that sort of adult). This means that sometimes we miss out; over the last couple of years it felt like we'd Missed Out in a very big way. Because, you see, we hadn't seen Frozen. Frozen is one of those animated films that has become a huge cultural icon. 'Let It Go' is everywhere. People are always posting hilarious versions of it on social media relating to news events or life in general; comments would be made about the cold not bothering me anyway. There were debates about how feminist it is, or isn't. None of which I watched, understood or partook in. I was Missing Out and I didn't like the feeling. Or so I thought. So we recorded it off the television, and did the decent thing last week. We watched it as originally intended - with an eleven year old who's currently staying with us along with her mother. Do you think you have ever Missed Out on something? Not only had the 11-year old not seen Frozen before, she's never seen snow or ice (we live in Cape Town). Most of you don't need me to tell you that Frozen is a really good film. The songs really do work; Let It Go is proper ear-worm fodder; the snowman and the reindeer are classic creations. I laughed out loud several times, as did the 11-year old. Finding ourselves thinking about fostering I thought ... if I was responsible for an 11-year old girl for whom I was responsible, would I want her to see this film? Yes, probably, I thought. Not only is it great fun but it's refreshing to see an animated princess who has agency and decision-making power and who isn't defined by the colour pink or her choice of man. It's got a way to go - I was a little troubled by the subtext that a woman's emotions affects everything and everyone around her - but this is much better a role model for young girls than many an all-age film I've come across before. For me it's a good animated film; up there with Up and Wall-E but not in Toy Story trilogy territory. But here's the thing; it was better when I hadn't seen it. Not having seen it had actually become part of me; a small part of me, but part of me nonetheless. I had gained a bit of cultural kudos from not having seen it; I was the person who hadn't seen Frozen!!! Now I was one of the crowd, just like everyone else. I was laughing at the jokes. I understand the lines about the cold not bothering me - but the thing is, it kind of does. It was a bit better on the outside.That shouldn't surprise me. People tend to experience me as a bit 'alternative'; just this week a friend in the same group discussion as me started laughing as soon as I took the microphone because he 'just knew you'd say something subversive'. I guess he was right; I talked about the way a certain passage of the Bible was used in demonic and dangerous ways by evangelicals like us.I need to watch this, though. Defining myself by something other than what Jesus says about me is very dangerous territory. I may prefer being a little on the edge but He says I'm chosen and accepted and in. If I'm not careful I could find myself frozen out just to make sure my fragile sense of self is intact. Better to get that from Him, not whether I've seen a given movie or what I think about a certain passage. Frozen is a good movie; I'm glad I've seen it. I do miss missing out, though. Not to worry. Big Hero 6 has just been released.",9,2,4,5 February 2015
Room," Beautiful, moving, transcendent, wondrous.
","Giving meaning to tragedy and trauma is dangerous ground. Whether you're a preacher, a writer, a journalist, a film-maker or just somebody trying to walk alongside someone experiencing trauma, the traps are the same. Say too much and you risk the trite, the trivial, the weightless; say too little and you risk a silence which is filled by worst imaginings. Try to find meaning and you flirt with missing the point, not doing justice to the pain; try to let events speak for themselves and you come close to nihilism. There's so much that can go wrong it's best to do nothing if you don't have to, if events don't force themselves on you. Trauma is distant to most of us But as I found out when my when friend was murdered by terrorists, that approach is ultimately of no use; sometimes the worst case happens, the unthinkable becomes your daily concern, the unimaginable your lived experience. This is the territory we are in with Room, the film adaptation of Emma Donoghue's massively successful novel (an adaption written by the novelist). I had little knowledge of the book personally, but the film-makers want us to be in no doubt as to where this film goes - the bare facts make this a hard sell. It's the story of a young woman (faultlessly played by Brie Larson) confined in one room for seven years where she's repeatedly raped by her captor; she inhabits the room with her five-year old son to whom she gave birth in the room as a result of the rapes. Jack's world is the world in four walls; it's all he's ever known, all he's ever seen save for what he sees through the single window in the form of a skylight and the television. This is a child's eye view film; it is through him we perceive the abuse which we never see; it's through him we learn of his mother past life on the outside; it's with him that we eventually journey to the outside world in the film's final third. Jack's mum has helped him create a fantastical world within the four walls of his existence; around his fifth birthday she tries to explain the outside world to him. He's disbelieving, but gradually grasps towards something resembling truth. When he attempts to affect their escape he's just about aware enough to cope with the revelation that there are other people and animals and places. We know there are real-world equivalents to this fictional story, but still this film is trying to imagine the unimaginable. By all rights it should be inadequate or trite or tasteless or just plain unbelievable. In trying to make a film that isn't a thriller or a drama or comedy but instead a hymn to love and relationships, the film-makers should be falling flat on their faces. Instead they've given us a genuinely unforgettable, overwhelming and transcendent film that helps us rediscover ourselves, our loved ones and the world around us. It finds beauty in the desperately ordinary thanks to some remarkable cinematography that makes the small room both a place of captivity and a universe to discover; the relationships are perfectly drawn and life-affirming thanks to Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's (the son, Jack) achingly beautiful performances. The depths of their relationship are unfathomable yet also utterly recognisable to anyone who has ever loved. The startlingly brilliant music haunts, prods, pushes and finally engulfs. We never see the rape or abuse take place, but we're left in no doubt as to its reality, its inescapability. Yet we're never without hope or beauty, and ultimately the film lets us and the characters find life in new, beautiful and subtle ways. There's much to say about Room, but at the end of the day there's little I can properly articulate. I can think of maybe one other film (Pan's Labyrinth - in many ways very different, in others very similar) that has come close to making me feel as moved, alive, tearful and full of wonder as this one. It's a rare work of art that leaves you speechless yet desperate to talk, but Room is one of them.",10,0,4,26 February 2016
A Quiet Place," A masterpiece of nerve shredding tension, with layers to peel back if you want to.
","Silence is a space on to which much can be projected. Fears and hopes, understandings and misunderstandings, rejection and acceptance, comfort and discomfort. Silent prayer is a rich tradition of many different streams of spirituality; God can speak in silence (as depressed, suicidal Elijah found); equally God's silence can be a fearful thing. In A Quiet Place, silence is something to be sought at all costs; but it's also a space into which fear, guilt, intimacy and much more besides can be projected.Humanity has been ravaged by monsters which hunt sound; noise-making is only safe in the context of a much louder noise. The film follows a two adults, three children family trying to make their way. Make a noise in the space of silence, and death is both swift and inevitable. It's a lean film - 86 minutes, a cast of 7 people, which is all the better to enable the viewer little time to mull on the central plot hole (if noise can be made next to louder noise, why not just go and live next to a damn or a waterfall?). Despite that, the film is almost unbearably tense - inevitably, large parts of it are silent. Communication is mostly unspoken, in gesture or sign language.There's profundity in stillness and silence: a hand held silent grace before a family meal is eloquent and moving; this is a family with its own share of trauma and guilt, healing is needed and maybe shared silence will allow for a portion of that. But mostly this is a film that grips like a vice and never lets go; it's breathless, and orchestrates a series of shocks and jumps with mastery. Scenes are prefigured brilliantly, to reach pay-off at an undefined later point; in one shot, the camera pans down to show a nail protruding from a step in the family's house. Given that bare feet are compulsory in the noiseless existence, we spend the rest of the film waiting for a foot to be pierced. When we realise that the mother - played by Emily Blunt, outstanding in a film where every performance is brilliant - is pregnant, we start to wonder how she can possibly survive giving birth; and even if she should, how might a newborn stay silent?Like Gravity - an effective but inferior film - the sound design makes the film what it is; silence, and the noise around it, makes for hard work for sound designers. They are justly rewarded with award recognitions. But what remains a mystery is why this film is so unrecognised in other categories; there are few better directed films, and Emily Blunt is remarkable. Critics, and especially awards, can often disdain genre films that evoke more visceral reactions - which, given the skill behind this film, is an insult to all concerned. It's a masterpiece of its type in miniature; a cine-literate one that references many other great thrillers (in one set piece the classic Harrison Ford thriller Witness is memorably evoked), horror films, science fiction and family dramas are all referenced.There's metaphors and deeper themes there also, if we want to see them: themes of love, guilt, parenthood and childhood. Could the film be read as a metaphor for how to reshape family life in an era where some feel 'traditional' or 'nuclear' families are no longer the norm? However that question is answered, what we can say is this: A Quiet Place is as good a horror-thriller as you are likely to see, low on gore, high on tension, a film that totally immerses the viewer in its world of eloquent, fearful silence.",9,0,3,1 February 2019
Amadeus," A masterpiece about a creator of masterpieces
","I don't speak the language of classical music. Not because I don't like it, not because I can't recognise it as beautiful or brilliant, not out of some sort of inverted snobbery. It's simply that it takes much work for me, like a very alien language. I don't have the time or energy for another language in my life, so I leave well alone. As proof that this is the case, not dislike or ignorance or whatever else people have opined to me as the reason, I offer consistently one of my favourite films. Amadeus was released in 1984, the year of my eleventh birthday. I can't recall when I first saw the film - I suspect about 3 years later on its television premiere - but it made a huge impact on me. In the year of forty-first birthday that impact hasn't diminished. It's directed by Milos Forman (most famous for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and adapted by the great Peter Shaffer from his own stage play. It tells the story of Mozart's professional life through the lens of court composer Antonio Salieri, a man tormented by his own relative mediocrity. It opens with an elderly Salieri in some kind institution for the mentally ill, claiming he killed Mozart and unburdening himself to a priest. Through that relationship, with the priest claiming to offer God's forgiveness, Salieri confesses his awe, jealousy and manipulation of the young genius, ultimately playing a key role in driving him to an early, overworked death. It's majestic, moving and utterly beautiful. It's a study of guilt - who doesn't reach Salieri's age without secrets they need absolution from? It's a study in the corrosive powers of success - the film's Mozart is perhaps most akin to a modern day elite sportsman, feted with praise and money he doesn't have the maturity to handle. It's a study in marriage under pressure - Constanze, Mozart's wife, is brilliantly played by Elizabeth Berridge; devoted to her husband, but one partner always just out of reach of the other. Most of all, it's a study in creativity and what we who benefit from the creativity want the creators to be like. Mozart should be as sublimely beautiful, dignified and upright as his creations. Instead, as this film and Tom Hulce's performance renders him, he's an obnoxious brat with an annoying laugh, no discipline and no self-control. It's that laugh that divides viewers; it's that laugh that Salieri hears even before he first lays eyes on the man he discovers to be Mozart. How can this man create such beauty? Thereby hangs the crux of the film, and Salirei's existential torment. It drives deals he strikes with himself and with God; it defies belief and offends the ears as much the music entrances them. It reaches its height in a spellbinding, unforgettable scene where Salieiri helps a bed-ridden Mozart work on his Requiem (a piece commissioned by a shadowy figure Mozart doesn't realise to be Salieri himself). Mozart hears the music in his head and dictates it to Salieri, who even then can barely keep up. Even with his nemesis at death's door, he can't hope to match him.Based in truth as it is (though how true it actually is, I don't know), the film achieves a kind of truth much more true than mere facts, uncovering the deeper realities of limited humanity's quest for transcendence. That's why, for instance, the American accents the actors keep throughout the film don't bother me one jot. The film is so true that the accents are frankly irrelevant; I'm not distracted by them, which I most certainly would have been by bad European accent imitations. It's a film which teaches me about beauty, hope, work, creativity and the freedom to take all my prayers - not just the safe, nice ones - to God and leave theme there. In my life as I live it, it's unmatched, unique and irreplaceable. I can't imagine my life without it; and I don't own a single note of Mozart's music.",10,0,2,15 July 2014
The Imitation Game," A very good, but not great, film that causes us to question the nature of greatness
","Britain is nothing if not arrogant, at the very least in terms of its name. How many other countries attach a statement of quality to their name: Great Britain? Of course there may well be historical reasons for this, and it may not actually be meant as a moniker of significance or quality; but as a citizen of the country it's always smacked of hubris. I've also always found the whole 'great nation' thing a little fatuous. How do we ascertain if a country is great? I hear many different claims for a country to be the greatest on earth, but seldom any independent verification of this. How do you judge a nation? How do you rank in terms of greatness? Most nations are great in the eyes of their own leader or citizens; but it seems a little aimless to try some sort of serious assessment of this. Why does one have to be better than the other? All this was in my mind during The Imitation Game, a true-story adaptation of one of the Second World War's more remarkable stories. Alan Turing - the subject of the film, played with characteristic commitment and insight by Benedict Cumberbatch - was the man who led the team which broke the German Enigma code, effectively shortening and/or winning the war for the Allies and saving a load of lives into the bargain. In doing so he not only achieved what many believed at the time to be impossible, but he also laid the template for every computer ever built. By any stretch of the imagination, surely Turing's was a great British achievement. It's certainly presented as such in this compelling and enjoyable film. Even if you are familiar with the story it's never less than utterly engaging; it's a story I know well and I still had to restrain an air-punch at the vital moment. It's a film that's hard not to enjoy. This is achieved with the understanding that the events of the film were a great moment in a great passage of history for Great Britain. It's not really a flag-waving film (apart from the entirely fair, correct and brief footage of people celebrating the war's end) so much as it's trying to be an honest and factual one. This was a great moment. (spoiler alert - if you don't know Turing's story and don't want part of the film revealed, skip to the next paragraph)Or was it? For the film doesn't leave it there. The euphoria is leavened by what comes next. The code-breaking is inter-cut with a post-war police investigation into Turing's private life, and scenes from his childhood. At the same time as his unique role in the war effort is discovered, so is his (then illegal) homosexuality. Given the choice between prison or chemical castration, he opted for the latter so he could keep working, Not long after, he committed suicide. Along with thousands of men of the era, his life was forever stained. It was only in 2013 that Turing received a posthumous royal pardon. Not so great. Even within the essence of an undeniably great British achievement are the seeds of something deeply shameful and unnerving. Greatness, it turns out, is a slippery and complex concept. We think about too simply. We see something admirable, and christen it with a title. Closer examination reveals it's not so simple. Whether it's a person or a country, a team or a charity, no one is entirely great. There's greatness in everyone and every group, every team and nation; there's also cruelty, shame, abuse, bullying, perversity and hate and any sin you care to name. There's only One truly deserving of the title 'Great'; really all other uses of the term should be with a small letter and a careful qualification. The Imitation Game is a very good film, but with a keen eye for British irony, not a great one. It's finely directed with a keen eye for detail and the importance of a good story. Occasionally it's just a little too mechanical to soar, too safe to really provoke in the way it perhaps could. It is, though, very good, exciting, funny and admirable. You won't be let down and you will, if you allow yourself, be made to think and look more closely at the previously untouchable and unsullied citizens of that far-off island called 'Greatness'.",8,2,5,29 January 2015
Silence," A Profound Adaptation Of One Of The Great Novels
","Based on Shusaku Endo's remarkable novel of the same name, a novel which many consider to be one of the very greatest of the 20th Century, this is a film I was very keen to see - but it took me a long time to get to. It's not an easy sell - over two and half hours on Catholic missionaries living and dying under brutal Japenese persecution. At the time of release, I remember one reviewer saying it was 'boringly pious'; an idea which seems to me to miss the point entirely.Both novel and film seek to understand why the Christian faith didn't take root in Japan in the same way it did in so many other countries; why so many missionaries failed and even recanted their faith under horrendous persecution. The reality is that in many countries where Christian worship and faith is violently opposed, it flourishes rather than dies. So what was different in Japan?That neither the film nor the book offers easy answers is the key; everyone - from the missionaries to the Japanese authorities to anyone who has studied this - has a theory, but none are completely satisfactory.On hearing that Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver had been cast as the two Portugues Jesuits at the heart of this story, I was concerned that they would not have the gravitas necessary; what did work well, it seems to me, in their casting was that their deliberate blankness and sincerity work well, especially in the earlier stages, as the well-meaning missionaries in an alien culture. The film's cinematography is startling and beautiful; in the first half of the film, there are repeated shots through mist or smoke, clarity partially revealed in counterpoint to the missionaries' own certainty; as the film progresses, however, this is flipped - there is sharp crispness to the images, a reversal of the missionaries' increasing doubts, confusion and fear. Other shots throughout deliberately echoing religious art, a painterly style that sometimes even merges into a literal painting. These are the Westernised visions of faith with which we are familiar; but an authentically Japenese vision of what faith may look like is missing - evoking for me the stained glass windows in my own church in Cape Town, where every depiction of Jesus or a Biblical character has white skin.There are hints of Heart Of Darkness and Apocalypse Now - the classic, critical story of Western colonialism; the noble, heroic Westerners journeying to 'dark places' to bring the light, discovering there's as much (or more) darkness in them as there is in the places they have come to.There's so much more to be said; like the novel, this is doubtless a film that will yield more with repeated viewing, and with whatever spiritual or theological eyes one views it with. The title refers to much - the apparent silence of God in responses to the missionaries' prayers, the silence of those watching or suffering the atrocities of persecution - and the silence of those killed by it. The enforced silence of the Japanese church. As one character says, echoing the Biblical experience of Elijah, '...it was in the silence that I heard your voice.'The film ends with a moment of speculation and uncertainty; a reminder not to judge. A reminder, perhaps, to those so quick to criticise Scorsese's much misunderstood earlier work, 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'. Both of these films require patience, humility and deep reflection from the viewer. Both of them have much to teach even those who are most convinced of their faith; both of them are rich, rewarding, serious films which deserve repeated attention. My personal preference of the two is this film, not least because of my deep affection for the original novel. But it's a film I need to digest and pray on, and it will, I hope, drive me to a deeper reflection on 'Last Temptation....', and much thought on my understanding of mission, ministry and faith.",9,12,13,11 November 2019
Midsommar," Flawed And Intoxicating
","When I went with a friend to see Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar', the first thing my friend said to me as the credits rolled was an apt summation of the film: 'Well, you certainly can't accuse him (the director) of lacking ambition'. Interstellar is flawed; but like all Nolan's films, the flaws somehow enhance it. The scale of his vision is intoxicating; his work consistently sweeps me up. I'd far rather see a film that shoots high but falls short than one that is shrivelled by lack of ambition.There's something of that in Ari Aster's first two films. I found Hereditary to be, for the most part, a chilling and occasionally shocking study of grief, loss and trauma. The last 20 minutes, when it suddenly turns in to the bizarre lovechild of Rosemary's Baby and The Wicker Man didn't work, but was also kind of endearing even as it let down what had gone before. Midsommar takes those last 20 minutes and turns them up to eleven.As with Hereditary - and many other horror films - the film deals with grief, loss and trauma. It also throws in the vivid experience of a slowly dying relationship being kept alive long past its best. The film's opening chapter - laying the groundwork of the trauma and loss that sets the film's agenda - is superbly evoked. As the characters deal with the aftermath, the film shifts to the increasingly bizarre and horrifying, isolated, neo-pagan Swedish community for the Midsommar festival. Central to this is a mesmeric performance from Florence Pugh who imbues her character with more complexity than the script might try to give her. There are many touchstones as things unravel - The Wicker Man (again), and crucially The Crucible. It's visually and technically stunning - the cinematography, the colours, the composition are all exceptional. Many hauntingly beautiful images remain the mind for a long time.The film is gripping, and I love that the narrative is unhurried, given room to breathe. But if it's seeking to be a horror film, it never really manages to be; plenty that's horrifying happens, but it's not frightening. The general arc - if not the specifics - is pretty clear from a long way out. There's plenty that's problematic (to put it mildly), that's hard to get past; the familiar trope of American movies that 'bad things happen if you go to Europe'; the wafer-thin (to be kind) characterisation of people of colour; to a rape scene near the film's finish that is used as a troubling motivation for a key decision; the film's use of mental health issues in characters is unhelpful.Hard as these are to get past, the scope and ambition of the film remains intoxicating; and I do wonder if Ari Aster is consistently, if subtly, trying to suggest throughout the film that none of the events actually happen - a fantasy of sorts in the mind of its central character. Ari Aster hasn't said this publicly (or at least, that I've heard); if this is the case, what's problematic in the film would remain so even with this explanation.How to summarise? Impossible to do so; if ever there was a film that shows the reductiveness of rating a film out of 5 or 10, then this is it. It overreaches significantly, but is endearing and intriguing almost because of that. It has many problems that are hard to get round. Ari Aster has a great film in him that he hasn't yet made; that much is clear. To get to it, maybe he should leave The Wicker Man further behind him.",7,0,2,5 August 2019
Elysium," Plenty of promise, but fails to fully deliver
","A peril of blogging about film is that it can give the inadvertent impression that my opinion of a given film is fixed. My blog about District 9 is a case in point. I enjoyed much about that film the first time around, but I concluded that it didn't have the depth it liked to think it did. I've re- watched it multiple times since (largely because it's a film people like to watch when they visit us in South Africa), and my admiration has grown and deepened. I still find it exciting and fun, but I keep seeing new depth in it too. It turns out that it was I who wasn't thinking deeply enough.So it's with a little apprehension that I finally settled down to watch the director (Neill Blomkamp) follow-up to that film, Elysium. Worryingly, my conclusions are similar if less positive overall; there's much that's good about it, but it's ultimately disappointing. Like the former, this is a science-fiction earthed in the director's South African reality. This time the context is the division between rich and poor; Earth has been left behind by the elite for an idyllic space- station called Elysium, always in view and out of sight by the teeming masses of poor left behind, grinding out lives of subsistence, dead-end jobs and subservience to a system loaded against them. Matt Damon gets caught up in an industrial accident on Earth; seeking healing he's embarked on a dangerous course of action to earn illegal passage to the man-made paradise and certain healing.There's so much about Neill Blomkamp's emerging style. He knows the grammar of science- fiction films well, but his is an authentically original voice and style. He directs actions scenes brilliantly in a post-Bourne world, using hand-held shaking cameras well but in a subtly different way. Every action scene is gripping and involving. As someone who lives in South Africa I like that he uses South African talent and patois alongside better known talent and language. Throwaway South African slang is brilliantly used to draw into the film's world, not alienate. District 9's star is back again, similarly intense but in a key supporting role and a world away from that film's fear-struck vulnerability.Overall, though, it just doesn't work. Key supporting roles (Jodie Foster's being a case in point) are under-written to the point that we're never quite sure what they're for even at key plot moments; the coldness of the privileged elite seems less like the gap between rich and poor and more like lazy writing. Other than good medical care and nice gardens, Elysium itself doesn't seem to have any actual content - which means the gap between rich and poor is never quite established beyond a need for good health care. Which might make sense (and it does) in South Africa, but just doesn't work for the film's central theme. By the time the climactic scenes roll around, you're impressed and entertained, but confused as to quite what's happening and why it all matters so much to so may people.It's a shame, but not a crying one. It's still a decent film, but I'd be really surprised if I grew to feel about this film the way I do about District 9. What we do know for certain, though, is that Neill Blomkamp is a director to watch with excitement.",6,0,0,11 April 2014
Joker," Probably Brilliant - But Possibly Not
","Advance buzz can make or break a film, but Joker has taken that to extremes. By the time film was released we'd had the advance buzz of a masterpiece, the backlash to the buzz, and the response to the backlash. What we knew ahead of time was this: this was a comic-book world film that was Serious and thought a lot of itself. Not in itself a bad thing - see also, for example, Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. But this was a film that expected to be treated with appropriate seriousness. All of which may have been a bit hard to take from the writer-director of the Hangover films, a series of films devoid of almost any moral framework or artistic saving grace. Of which more in a moment.As we know, this character has become something of a staging post for great screen actors; to have, now, an eponymous origin story starring one of the most intense and magnetic actors in Joaquin Phoenix, it may be seen to be lobbying for an almost Shakesperean tragic scale. And it's true that Pheonix turns in a remarkable performance, one of physical and vocal contortions that knowingly tips in to dance at important points. Deliberately recalling Scorsese's masterpieces of the Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, King Of Comedy era - and many other films besides , the film has desperately contemporary echoes, not least when the increasing crowds of Joker impersonators are 'dismissed as clowns' by the authorities at hand, which seemed to be a clear echo of Hilary Clinton's infamous 'deplorables' comment, the last nail in her electoral coffin.Mental illness is a big theme too, and one that's hard to decide on if the film has got it right; the central character suffers from a condition (explained by a card he carries), which seems him laugh inappropriately when under pressure or stress. Ironically, in the screening I attended there was much incongruous and disturbing laughter to accompany moments of violence and distress on-screen.There are some excellent supporting turns also - from Robert DeNiro, for whom it must have been an odd experience to see his own role in King of Comedy so heavily referenced; and from Frances Conroy as Joker's deluded (or not?) mother.The film appears to be reaching after big themes about the division between rich and poor; the denial of services to the latter; imitative violence and much else. Inevitably, it touches on Batman's origins; there's a neat twist or two in that, though - twists which surprise, make thematic sense and make a point about morally murky lines. The film seems to be trying to elicit some kind of initial sympathy for Joker; the incident which sets him on his violent path is one in which Batman would have acted similarly, all be it with less blood. In origins at least, there's little to separate villain and noble vigilante.Where you land with this film ultimately depends on what you take into it, and what you want from it. Some could see it as justifying evil; equally, it would be easy to read it as a commentary on significant societal issues. I tend towards the latter after days of reflection on it, the better to get the distance from how the film triggered me in various quite personal ways. It's hard to truly evaluate this, though, when the director has films as vaccuous and lacking in ethics, as openly racist, misogynistic and homophobic as the Hangover films. I'd suggest we need more distance - and a sense of both the where the story is taken in any future films and the future arc of the writer-director's career, to help us truly discern what this iteration of one of modern cinema's most iconic characters is trying to do or say - if anything. One of the many lapses into dance from Phoenix in the lead role put me in mind of the infamous, harrowing and often misunderstood dance that accompanies a little of the old ultra-violence in A Clockwork Violence. Is that knowing, clever or callous? Perhaps only time will tell.Ultimately I think it's a brilliant piece of work, that may slightly over-reach itself; it's possible I may change that view on future viewings. Whatever view you take, I'd say one final thing: please make sure you actually see it first, before forming an opinion. And maybe give it time to settle for a few times after. A film that spends so long in the dark needs some reflection in the daylight.",8,1,5,8 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Way, Way, Way Too Long
","I enjoyed chapter 1 - didn't find it scary, but it was a fun, entertaining blast. Chapter 2 is, let's be clear, far too long. At two hours fifty minutes, it could easily lose an hour's running time with little difficulty - a generic 'getting the gang back together' riff being one of the chief offenders. It drags so much, that by the time the final hour or so rolls around, I was just tired. It's a pretty diverting final hour, but it too is needlessly extended. With the talent around this movie, there's an interesting and potentially frightening take on childhood trauma and memory buried somewhere; but that movie is buried beneath the acres pointlessness.",6,2,2,15 May 2020
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Flawed, but wonder and awe-inspiring.
","I saw this film in IMAX 3D HFR format.Some people are never satisfied. Granted, there's not a single one of Peter Jackson's six Tolkein adaptations that isn't in some way flawed. To listen to some talk about the Hobbit films you'd think, however, that he was guilty of mass murder of at least the Transformer films. I remain convinced that from the perspective of history this set of six will be widely-loved and cherished. Frankly I want him to keep making films like this for the rest of my life. If the first Hobbit was a film that spoke to me of grace and the second was one that spoke to me of joy, then this third instalment induces in me somewhere between childlike wonder and awe. Like the rest of this trilogy, it's too little narrative stretched over too much screen time. Like The Return Of The King the large-scale battle sections overwhelm character and nuance. Like all the other films, Orlando Bloom is still phoning it in. Unlike the 3rd LOTR film, this one decides that one ending will suffice, and it's a beautiful, funny and entirely apt ending that moved me to a slightly moistened eye behind my annoying 3D glasses. Like the other films, and true to Jackson's film-making roots, there's some tough stuff in here. Picking up right where the previous film left off, it opens with Smaug laying waste to the nearby city; the attendant action scenes are fantastic, and the footage of ordinary people turned to refugees in fearful panic is chilling and contemporary. There then, essentially, follows a series of sequences of various characters being foreboding about oncoming war, plus a little sneaking around and double-dealing. Richard Armitage as dwarf king Thorin takes centre stage wrestling with 'gold sickness' as much as Frodo will later wrestle with the Ring's power and temptations. It doesn't quite have the Ring's chilling relevance but it's powerful stuff nonetheless and still a fine performance.It's all marking time, to be honest, for the titular battle. A masterfully presented battle it is too. There's a few moments where there's too much CGI (Legolas running up some falling bricks sticks in the memory in a bad way); other than that, it's stunning. There are five armies, and for us to be fully involved in personal skirmishes as well as large scale conflict and still be able to keep a handle on the story and who is fighting who and why is no small achievement. There are moments of liquid beauty too - elf armies aligning, especially; and some truly memorable weapons and creatures ... a large troll-thing with a stone thing round his head being a funny but still powerful highlight.As mentioned, occasionally the computer imagery takes over too much, which is an unusual fault in these films. Mostly the human wins through, but here the artifice is occasionally too obvious. For me this was exacerbated by the artificiality of HFR; all be it that IMAX remains the best format for large-scale films like this. By movie's, however, it was only my diary and the late hour keeping me from diving straight into the LOTR trilogy.",8,2,6,22 December 2014
Arrival," A thoughtful, haunting take on a familiar story - with layers to explore
","I didn't realise this was such a dark film. Seeing it in the cinema on release I had been so overwhelmed by the sound, the cinematography and Amy Adams's mesmeric performance that this passed me by. I'm not talking about tone, of course; this films ends in a place of hope and invitation. I mean in light levels. Most - or all? - of the exterior scenes of the film take place in shadows, or with the sun evidently just one side of the horizon or the other. Interiors are low lit also; I notice two exceptions - the spotlight shone from a helicopter in to Amy Adams's face when Forest Whitaker returns to pick her up in the early stages of the story, the second towards the film's end, when the whole screen is bathed in white smoke as one character goes behind the screen that had separated people from the alien visitors up to that point. It all points to a person - and a human race - living in the half-light of partial understanding; unaware that there's a light that can be turned on until someone (or something else) does it instead.In many respects this film tells a familiar story of alien first contact with earth, and tells it as a thoughtful drama rather than an action spectacular. Like many science-fiction stories, this is one concerned with how we as a species and as individuals understand ourselves, and how we conceive of 'the other' - whether that's people or beings different to us, or God. It's certainly the case that even on the small screen this is a film that's deeply effective in evoking a sense of wonder; it may only be just over 30 minutes in to the film when we first see the aliens, but the lighting, the camera's repeated reminding us of Amy Adams's aloneness, the sound design and the remarkable score all evoke a sense of encounter with something that is truly different, alien in every sense of the word.Amy Adams's performance is towering; she seems to be on screen for at least 95% of the run time; for much of that time we seem to be following her from behind or looking in to her face, a face blessed with the ability to express volumes. This film was always going to stand or fall on her performance; as a result, it stands very tall indeed.The film initially sets itself up as a struggle between science (in the shape of Jeremy Renner's character, a theoretical physicist) and language (Amy Adams); but it becomes more than that. Breakthrough in communication with the aliens is only achieved when Adams, followed by Renner, break out of the strict, rigid almost ritualistic structures laid down by science and the military; maybe it's because I'm a priest and I was watching it in Holy Week, that I saw more than a hint of a reference to the curtain in the temple, separating people from God, through which only one priest could go and which was torn in two by Jesus' crucifixion.There's something in that, however. So often words and laboratories, religion and science, mind and heart are pitted against each other. In Arrival we see the fruit of something else; something the film calls a 'non-zero sum' game, a movement beyond linear, binary thinking in to something more fluid, more supple. If moving beyond the boundaries laid down by military and science gives humanity a breakthrough in communicating with the aliens, it's a departure from conventional 'zero sum', straight line thinking that is the key to the whole mystery and crisis that forms the heart of the film.Like Arthur C Clarke's classic 1950s novel Childhood's End (clearly an influence on both this film and its source text), the vision of humanity presented could easily be something so optimistic and naive as to be of no use. Certainly that's where Childhood's End left me; but I felt differently on rewatching Arrival. Of course, right and wrong, truth and falsehood and many others are binaries we need - too much blurring of the lines leaves with an epidemic of uncertainty and fake news. This time around, however, I was reminded of how I characterise my own thinking as someone with ADD and two learning disabilities; not neuro-typical, I guess you would say. I say that I don't think in straight lines; I think in blobs. Then I try to string the blobs together, make connections in order to form coherent thought and output (or not ... ). Straight lines can be helpful; but I find it very difficult to follow them.A valuing of intuitive, relational thinking can also make us a bit more humble, a little less keen to make it all about us. Especially useful when it comes to the 'other' - the other person, culture, lifestyle or God. Trying to build bridges with something or someone utterly different to us needs more than a straight line-rationale; it needs a humble willingness to take the long, winding road of presence, listening and submission. When it comes to God, it comes with the awareness that we can't build the bridge ourselves; we have to accept that all our rationality will only get us so far, and instead accept the invitation to the humble submission of walking across a bridge which we had no hand in building - and which for much of the time, we can't see the other side of, or even much more than a step or two in front of us.Arrival, in the form of Amy Adams's portrayal of a linguistics expert learning a new of way of speaking and thinking, presents us with a humbling invitation to engagement with others and the Other; a vision which requires us to step beyond the straight lines we naturally default to, a commitment to the long and winding road of another's design. It is in the letting go that we take up, the losing that we find, the dying that we live.",9,2,3,15 April 2019
Marriage Story," A Love Story About Divorce
","I think the first film I remember crying at was Kramer v Kramer; I don't know how old I was, but I remember being in the same room as it when the TV was showing it one Christmas. I don't think I fully understood it - but I know what stayed with me so powerfully was the way I sensed it articulating something of my own fear of my own parents splitting up. Not that I ever had any reason to think that would happen - it didn't. But I remember the fear.Many years and 20 years of my own marriage later, Marriage Story doesn't evoke the same fear, but it does evoke both a kind of sadness as to the way it portrays what so many go through, a kind of recognition of the sort of slow escalations that all of us experience in almost any sort of relationship. It's the simple - yet complex - story of a couple's marriage in breakdown ... they start in couple's counselling and ends in divorce, following the negotiation of the details along the way.It seems odd to cast the film among the performance industry - he is a theatre director, she an actress; at times that's in danger of tipping the film into the sort of conflicts most of us don't have to deal with, but in the end there's enough truth there to make this feel like an 'everyman' sort of relationship.The whole film hints occasionally at the heightened realities of musicals - the framing, the tight close-ups and tracking shots following the long speeches of one or the other, maybe even the colour palette at times suggesting the 1950s/60s musicals golden era. When Adam Driver's character, near the film's end, sings a Sondheim song in a bar, that sense is bought closer to the heart; like musicals, the film is unashamed in trying to move us and does so.Much of this is quite remarkable - Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are outstanding, both of them simultaneously sympathetic and repellant, highlighting the reality that the film doesn't force us to choose one side or the other; or if it does, the way we jump is down to our own biased, not the film's. The film's standout moment, an argument that starts amicably and ends in words that can't be unsaid, is the sort of sequence you feel as if you're privy to someone else's private pain, laundry that should only aired in private hung out for all to see. It's remarkable in performance, direction and writing - and everything else besides.The film also mines comedy out of some of the most painful situations; the moment Adam Driver's character is served with divorce papers is almost farce-like in its execution, yet the tonal shift within the scene never jars. Much within the film is funny, because people are funny; there's always a hint of joy, even in the midst of great pain.This, I think, is where the hope in the film comes from; given where we are almost certain the film will end right from the first scene, the light touches of humour and the moments of clarity amidst the recriminations, claims and counterclaims point us to the human capacity to be better versions of ourselves even when so much seems to be falling around us. Like the best films, it's never one thing entirely - it's a love story about a divorce, a drama with very good jokes and comedic scenes, a musical with only one song. It's a film about one particular relationship, that allows us to see every relationship (not just marital ones) in a fresh light.",9,3,4,11 February 2020
Black Panther," Fun and significant.
","Black Panther, to which I took foster son yesterday. Like many parents, I've taken him to many superhero movies. He loves them; each time, though, we're sitting there seeing white people/men doing amazing things in America or Europe. How refreshing, then, to sit with my brown-skinned (foster) son and see a cast of people who represent him for a change, doing amazing things in Africa and doing so without white people rescuing them. How refreshing to see a vision of Africa without colonisation; how refreshing to see a hero character who learns something from the villain and where Africa has something to teach and give to the world. How refreshing for a South African audience to hear a South African language in a mainstream movie. How refreshing to hear the round of applause as the audience recognised their stories being told, the laughs of recognition. I don't think my foster son is aware enough of the context to appreciate the significance of this movie, but I was moved and thrilled. As a white Western male I've seen too much of an idealised vision of myself on the screen; I want my children to be able to see themselves in films like this, with inspiring women and the stories of black people being told in films that are both good and fun. More, please.",8,7,19,24 February 2018
The Matrix," 20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.
","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....",10,37,52,22 February 2019
What We Do in the Shadows," A sign of great things to come ... flawed but funny
","I'm late to this party, and seeing it for the first time in 2019 it's easy to see the seeds of what led Taika Waititito get the Marvel gig (and execute it so brilliantly). Amongst all (sub) genres, comedy-horror is one of the hardest to get right; the film needs to be both a proper comedy and also a proper horror movie to really work, and take both genres at face-value. Shaun Of The Dead executes this near flawlessly; What We Do In The Shadows does well, but not quite enough for me. The documentary format - whilst a good joke - means it leans more on the comedy, and hence isn't really horror enough. The horror elements play almost as Hammer at its worst, which may or may not be intentional, but distracts from the nuanced performances. Some of the gags are brilliant - the verbal comedy, the physical, the nods to other films and especially the good natured, self aware fun with the rules and tropes of vampirism. Occasionally it hints towards bigger themes - homophobia, for instance. That would be a good fit; vampire stories are almost always about sex or sexuality in some way. The 'coming out' scene is inspired; the scenes of bullying in the street both funny and moving. But the theme never quite takes the theme far enough; it feels like one of a bunch of ideas thrown at the wall until something sticks. The film lacks an ultimate emotional punch for which it strives, and I'm left with the feeling that the newly-launching spin-off TV series might be the best format for this. It's good, of course, and has much re-watch value and quotability ... but the director had better ahead of him.",7,0,0,29 March 2019
Cube," Effective and compelling, despite a flawed script
","A strange, satisfying but far from flawless low-budget science-fiction horror drama. A group of strangers wake up to find themselves in a huge cube consisting of equal-sized rooms, some of which contain fatal traps. They don't know each other, why they're there, where they are or how to get out. As the film passes, the group are inevitably picked off and we learn more of who they are. There's much to be commended, especially in an era of cinema replete with prequels, cinematic universes, backstory and origin stories where everything that can be explained is explained. Though this film has a (kind of) tidy ending, there's much we don't know; a lot is left to our imagination, for us to fill in the blanks - or to leave them blank if we want to. Is the film about conspiracy theories; a Lord of the Flies style experiment in human savagery; an exercise in sadistic ways of dying? Other things? All of them? None of them? That's the appeal and potential frustration of the film. Despite a script that is at times badly flawed and some very limited performances, this is a film that works because of what it doesn't tell us, making the best of a clearly limited budget. Sometimes less really is more.",7,0,1,29 March 2019
Easy A," Brilliant, Funny High School Romcom That Takes The Genre For A Contemporary Spin
","I'm very fond of this film; a high school romantic comedy, one of the best of its kind, and very much one of the best of the subset of romcoms that are reworkings of classic texts. In this case, it's The Scarlet Letter that gets the treatment.The emerging Emma Stone in the lead is brilliant; but what really makes this is the brilliant cast, fine actors in small roles everywhere you look. Of course, no one speaks as the characters do in this film - but of course, that's not the point. There are so many good gags, I keep losing count; my favourite ones being the almost throwaway jokes around the lead's kitchen table as the scene fades into the next one, taking the viewer delightfully by surprise.It also takes many of the classic, often problematic, tropes of classic high school romcoms, and cleverly subverts them. Emma Stone's Olive is a woman discovering she can take control of her life; and the cost to her, and others, as she tries to conform to type along the way. Rewatching this in 2019, this starts to look like it was, even then, somewhat ahead of its time; it's a delightful, engaging but quietly powerful unpacking of the damage toxic masculinity has on women (and men). Well worth watching, and rewatching.",9,1,1,2 November 2019
