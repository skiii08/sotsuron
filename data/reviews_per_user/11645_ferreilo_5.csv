Requiem for a Dream," totally blown away, for many reasons
","I have found, that for anyone that sincerely has that deep appreciation for movies, for their art, for their messages, it takes a long time to find all the right words to describe this movie............ Right off the top, it's cinematography is spellbinding, joyful, and enlightening..........something truly to be appreciated........... the acting..........even more so............ellen burnstyn(?) is totally incredible........the fact that julia roberts won an Oscar over her is totally shameful...........I do 100% agree with a previous comment that this movie is much more than just about drugs..........drugs were the downfall......the scapegoat...........but the real issue here was their dreams.......and fantasies.........and how low they already were with their own realities............that they were willing to do whatever it took............morally and knowingly wrong...........to somehow try to reach those dreams............however hopeless reality told them it would be................ this was desperate hope to the core..........to the extreme.......... this movie is to the extreme...........yet not so unreal either.........it may make you sick to the stomach..........it may want you to turn a blind eye and deny............it may at least want to make you shake your head and say never.................. BUT...............deep..............DEEP................inside.....................it scares you to your very core.................... because you can FEEL how it can begin................................ and you can never let that go..............NO MATTER WHAT...........................a totally incredible, fantastic, yet horrifying movie...............WOW",10,0,0,1 October 2001

Blow," another facet of the '70's' experience and history
","Our interest with the life and times of those who lead the 60's and 70's 'experience' has once again been meet with fascination.  Like the classic 'Scarface', I was totally spellbound, though on a very different level. While Scarface represented the immigrant coming to America to find that dream, at whatever cost, Blow represented the same story, but from the American, trying to get out of the existence he was born in, trying to find that American dream he was brought up to believe in.  This movie was not so much about the drugs and violence, but about a person/people, trying to find that dream, knowing what they know best, doing what they do best.  This movie has heart and soul, yet despair and dissolutionment.  Once again, Johnny Depp is understatingly brilliant, and Paul Rubin 'PeeWee' is a refreshing and funny delight. This movie is disturbing, realistic, funny, and sad, and I still walked away feeling further enriched, knowing a little bit more about recent society and why we are where we are today............",9,0,0,9 April 2001
