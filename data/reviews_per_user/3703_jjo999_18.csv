Requiem for a Dream," This is the best movie I have ever seen!
","I encourage all teenagers/young adults to watch this powerful and informative movie.  It takes a realistic approach to describe the harmful effects of drugs, keeps you at the edge of your seat, and able to sympathize with the four main characters.",10,0,0,8 February 2003
50 First Dates," A movie to move you in more ways than one!
","Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore make the perfect couple in this romantic comedy. Although romantic comedies tend to consist of more romance than comedy or more comedy than romance, I think this movie did a pretty good job of combining both elements to create an extremely engaging plot. It's true that there are a lot of movies about memory loss, but there are also a lot of other common themes in movies as well. The reason why I can't bash this movie as some of the people on the message board chose to do is because it really made me laugh all the way through and brought tears to my eyes at the end. Very few movies can move me in more ways than one. That is why I encourage you to check the movie out for yourself. For those of you who are sticklers for really good acting, I'm pretty sure you'll be satisfied. Barrymore and Sandler tend to be great actors in their films and they don't fall short of their skills in '50 first Dates.'",10,0,1,19 February 2005
Meet the Parents," Funny and pretty realistic too!
","I usually don't laugh as many times as I did while watching Meet the Parents. This comedy was hilarious and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller on the screen. One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it stayed focused on the plot. It didn't go off in different directions and it maintained a sense of reality that a lot of comedies lack. At the same time, it was funny from beginning to end. I'd have to say that another thing that makes this movie work well is that the relationship between Gaylord (Greg) and Pam is already in progress from the start of the movie so the viewer is immediately able to get to know the two of them and the relationship they have with each other. I have no complaints about this movie.",10,4,7,4 June 2005
Se7en," I fell asleep during my first attempt to watch it.
","I know that many of you will probably want to strangle me for saying this, but I fell asleep during my first attempt at watching Se7en. I really tried to stay awake, but all attempts proved to be unsuccessful. I just couldn't stay interested. In order for a thriller to satisfy me, it has to have suspense and action. Se7en was lacking in both areas. I'll admit that the whole idea of incorporating the seven deadly sins into it was clever. However, the movie was not capable of holding my attention because it did not show any of the crimes as they were happening. When I watched the movie for the second time, I managed to stay awake. Once I got toward the end of the movie when 'John Doe' was introduced, I finally understood what was so good about it. The end was definitely praiseworthy because it was the only intense part. I don't mean to bash the acting. Pitt, and Paltrow as well as the rest were superb actors. However, the overall storyline was insufficient.",4,2,14,25 November 2004
Wayne's World," Sends us the right message regarding comedy!
","This comedy is definitely hilarious. I'll admit, it's a bit unconventional, but I think that's what makes it such a successful comedy. It remains in pure comical status from beginning to end. This is apparent in the choice of having three endings at the close of the movie. It seems that in doing this, the movie was almost reassuring me that I don't have to actually FEEL for any of the characters. I can just finish the movie thinking, 'Wow, this was funny,' and nothing more. I actually liked knowing that for once it would be acceptable for me to just laugh at a movie without taking it seriously as so many people often do. I don't think comedies are always meant to make perfect sense, and laughter is always more important than the idea of everything fitting together in the end.I also love how this movie is made so that the audience gets to see what is going on from the beginning and we are allowed to know that Wayne and Garth are obviously being manipulated by their producer, but they don't completely realize it themselves.Also this movie shows us that two nerdy grunge guys can in fact get chicks and I guess that's a good thing, right? LOL!",7,0,1,20 July 2005
Monster," Well-made but too creepy!
","What can I say? This movie gave me nightmares for three nights in a row. It's definitely graphic enough and I've always thought that the most realistic creepy movies have the ability to scare a person more than an actually horror movie. The movie was very well-made though. The actors were so good, I couldn't even detach them from their characters when I tried, and who knew that Charlize Theron, the pretty woman in 'Sweet November' could look so hideous with any amount of makeup? LOL. Anyway, the story is very disturbing and this is what makes the movie disturbing as well. However, it is definitely a good documentary to see. If anything, you'll learn more about the things that make life scary sometimes, but I'm not sure if this is a movie I'd necessarily want to watch again.",7,0,1,20 July 2005
Hostel," FINALLY...something unpredictable hits the theater!
","Before I start writing a long comment about how hot Jay Hernandez is and how awesome his character was in this movie, I have to say that the making of Hostel was a job well-done. First of all, it is very unpredictable. This is a quality we're losing during an era of frequent remakes. It is nice to watch a movie these days and not know how it is going to end until the actual end. When Hernandez's character escaped from where he is staying in the Slovakian city, I figured...hey, that's great, but he'll either die in the end or the evil characters will win. This is usually what happens in most horror movies, and while a lot of people like that, it gets to be quite an overused approach. The one part of the movie that did not prove unpredictable was when the Japanese girl committed suicide after viewing her deformity. (I really did see that one coming.)Another great thing about this movie is that it is somehow able to mix humor with thrilling and gory scenes. Most intense thrillers do not have truly funny moments that leave you to bust out laughing, but this movie had moments to be scared, moments to laugh as well as moments to clap. For those of you who have not yet seen the movie, I will tell you that the whole ending portion is truly different from anything you have ever seen in a thriller/horror movie before, but do not be discouraged. Change is good and it proves to be refreshing in this movie. The acting is great too. When the backpacker friends are scared, they don't give us this special thought out reaction; they just give us a realistic portrayal of fear. One panics and begs for mercy (which is probably what I would do), and the other shows fear, but also tries to use whatever strength he can muster from his brain to develop his strategy for escape (that would be Jay). I will not reveal anymore about this movie, but I will say that you just have to see what Hernandez does at the end. It will truly serve as a surprise!",10,6,12,9 January 2006
The Notebook," The best love story I've ever seen!
","This is by far the best romantic drama I have ever seen, and it would be difficult for future movies to compete with it. Although movies with elements of romance tend to get shot down so easily by viewers, I definitely thought 'The Notebook' was worthy of a positive judgment. The story was beautiful and I can not think of one way I would change it. This is not simply a movie about two people falling in love and living happily ever after. It is a movie that gives you a view of how two people in love can find their way back together after a cruel separation. If you have not seen this movie in the theater, I encourage you to rent it when it comes out on DVD. I know it's a love story, and you may be figuring that it may not be worth your time, but I can assure you that there is nothing typical about it. The acting is superb, and I could watch it over and over again. It brought tears to my eyes. Will it bring tears to yours? Take a chance, and find out. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go buy the book!",10,2,3,25 November 2004
Spider-Man 2," Caught in the web again!
","I just can't help it. I'm a sucker for romance and I am touched so deeply to see the romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. I think it is one of the reasons why I seem to like the second Spiderman movie a bit more than the first. I actually believe that the second movie is a necessary continuation of the first one since the first one leaves the viewer hanging. Throughout the second movie, Peter Parker struggles to learn his destiny and how to create a balance in life, which is essential since the first movie ends without him being able to do this. The acting is also excellent. Sometimes sequels aren't as successful as the first, but I can honestly say that this one was just as praiseworthy as the first. Now that I have heard that a third one is in the making, I have become very excited to see it.",9,2,4,5 January 2005
Troy," Well-structured plot!!
","Whether historically accurate or not, an excellent movie was made. It had a well-structured plot and outstanding acting which made it very entertaining. After all, that's what movies were made for, entertainment. If you want something that is entertaining AND accurate, read the book, but don't bash the movie. It does exactly what it is meant to do. I was very impressed with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. They were great choices for their characters since Brad appears serious and muscular and Orlando appears young and timid. The other actors/actresses were remarkable as well.One thing I do not understand is how I can feel so much sympathy for Achilles in the end, even though I do not like his behavior/attitude throughout the movie. I guess the actors in this movie really knew how to lure in their viewers. If you haven't had the chance to check it out in the theater, it's out on DVD now, so check it out. It has some great fighting scenes if you're into that sort of thing.",9,1,7,7 January 2005
Corpse Bride," The animation is still hot!
","Tim Burton did a great job with this movie. I really enjoyed seeing the 'Nightmare Before Christmas' type of animation used once again. It hasn't gotten old and I don't think it will. Not for awhile. Anyway, the movie was very cute, the art was well done as it truly captured the personalities of the characters, and music was always used at the most appropriate moments. There were also many funny moments as well. I just hope that my fiancé never marries a corpse in the woods by accident! LOL. That wouldn't be too funny! I would say more, but the movie is so well done that I feel I am doing it better justice by leaving the comment short.",10,2,5,14 October 2005
Spider-Man," This movie caught me in its web!
","This is definitely a great movie. It has action, romance, and outstanding acting. Tobey Maguire does a great job, and manages to maintain the appearance of a hero, hunk, and nerd all at the same time. (Why couldn't high school boys be like that? LOL!!) Anyway, Kirsten Dunst was beautiful and fit into her role so well. I can definitely see her appearing in other super hero movies. She gives off the same vibe as actresses like the talented Nicole Kidman, and Michelle Pheiffer. I never got into Spiderman comic books growing up, but I loved the movie. It really met my expectations very well, and though many people may disagree with me, there's something about the Spiderman movies that holds my interest even more than the Batman movies. I guess you could say Spiderman is my favorite super hero. Go figure! I don't even like spiders!",9,0,1,5 January 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Earns a million stars!
","I do not know how to begin praising this movie. The plot was amazing and it goes very deep. The relationship between the characters is just so real that I felt like I was taken into the movie myself. I felt like I was there actually watching everything happen. I've never been interested in boxing, but this was okay because the movie was about so much more than the sport. It was obvious to see that Hilary Swank's character, Maggie was not a failure even though she wound up on the floor after fighting for the winning title. She won because she achieved what she wanted to achieve in life, and there aren't many people who can be satisfied with that. This movie can teach us all something about life and how to appreciate it and though many may find the message behind the movie cliché, I don't think it could be emphasized enough since we all forget how to appreciate life over and over again.The acting was amazing. Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman work so well together, and I had no reason to be displeased with how they acted out their roles.Warning: If you have not yet watched the movie, do not read the next paragraph. It will ruin the ending for you!!The only part of the movie which confused me was when Frankie pulls the cord. Isn't this illegal and immoral to some people? I'm not sure if he should have done this. The movie was really good so I'm not going to dwell on this. It's just that he developed such a fatherly relationship with Maggie and it's kind of odd to see him make the choice he makes. Anyway, the movie earns about a million stars from me, but since I can only give it 10, I guess that will do.",10,2,4,21 July 2005
Saw II," The Jigsaw Killer Strikes Again!
","If you enjoyed Saw, I have a feeling you will enjoy Saw 2. After watching both movies on the theater screen, it was hard to judge which one is best. After all, when you watch the first movie of any series, the story is new and therefore less predictable than when it is developed into a sequel, but I think I've finally decided that the second movie is the best, mostly because there is a lot of movement. Though the confinement in the first movie creates an interesting tension in the theater, the second one creates an overwhelming sensation as you watch the characters travel from room to room. I also like the idea of putting a whole group of characters together in such a creepy situation. The expectation is that they will work together to get out, but this movie shows you how members of a group against each other when their lives are at stake. I also like how viewers are presented with the idea that a group of people who seem very different can have more in common than they realize face to face. The twists in this movie are great! I hope a third movie can be developed from this storyline.",10,1,2,9 January 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A tasteful bite!
","I love what Tim Burton does with the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I do not feel that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has done that version any injustice of any kind. This movie is full of laughs and it even has eerie qualities which are a large part of what makes the movie work so well. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka just seemed to be exactly what I was expecting. I was pleased with his makeup as well as the character's tone of voice and attitude.I was also pleased with the various behaviors given to the children. They were all much more bratty than I had expected them to be and this only added to my sympathy toward Charlie...not to mention, it was amusing! I also liked how each child who won the golden ticket was shown before actually arriving to the factory. This gave me a chance to get to know them and their personal attitudes and this was hilarious to watch.In a newspaper article, I read that people could somehow make a connection between Johnny Depp's character and Michael Jackson, and he as the actor could understand why people could make this connection. Aside from some resemblance and what seemed to be similar behavioral characteristics, I could honestly expect Michael Jackson's Neverland to be as strange and unique as Willy Wonka's chocolate factory!",10,3,7,20 July 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," This movie is beautiful and inspirational!
","This is one of the most inspirational movies I have ever seen. When I went to go see it with my boyfriend, we found that we could relate to Kate Winslet and Jim Carey's characters in many ways. Aside from the inspirational side of the movie, I was extremely impressed with its artistic side. I enjoy movies that encourage viewers to think about what is going on. On the way home from the movie theatre, I had to think about the movie and its structure for a few minutes before I could piece it together. This movie was a masterpiece. Love story?....Yes! However, it's not the typical love story. It really touches a deeper place of the heart, and although erasing the human memory is not a very realistic thing to do in today's society, the message the story conveys is very real! When the movie was out in theaters, most of the theaters in my area were not playing it, but after seeing the movie preview for the first time, I had to find a place to see the movie. When I found it at Lake theater, in Oak Park, I was quite excited to view it. Now, I own the movie in my collection, and it still remains one of my top favorites of all time.",10,2,5,24 November 2004
Saw," This was the most intense movie I've ever seen!
","Other thrillers have been intense, as well as scary, but this one is definitely the most psychologically intense. What makes the movie truly scary is how realistic the plot is, because if you think about it....everything that happens could actually happen in today's world. This movie gives you a view into the way an insane mind could work. I left the movie feeling like I was a second a way from a heart attack. So, brace yourself. This movie is not for the faint at heart. Be sure that you are prepared. I also recommend that you take someone with you. I don't usually spend money on a movie to see it a second time, but this one was worth the extra 8.50. I would highly recommend this movie to people who think 'Seven', and 'The Exorcist' were intense. The writer of this movie may have a sick mind, or maybe it's just too creative!!",10,0,0,24 November 2004
Braveheart," Oustanding acting and
","This is a wonderful movie to watch again and again. It has a plot that is interesting to follow, and the action is intense and believable. Mel Gibson displays his romantic and heroic side in a way that really touches me. He is truly talented and is very remarkable in this film. The entire supporting cast really brings a lot of belief into the movie as well. One aspect of the movie that held my interest is how we are able to see William's character as an innocent child and as a grown man whose fate becomes that of a hero. This is a widely viewed movie, but if you haven't seen it yet, I encourage you to check it out and see if it appeals to your taste. It's serious, emotional, and powerful!",9,1,2,10 February 2005
