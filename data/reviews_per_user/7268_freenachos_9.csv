Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," In Defense of Star Wars
","This is an above average movie.  A lot of the reviews here seem to be emotional knee-jerk responses more than thoughtful comments.It does live up to decent-movie standards but it doesn't accomplish the nearly impossible task of living up to is it's hype.  I think this is why there are so many over-negative reviews.   I do think this film was made to indulge a filmmaker who just wants to keep telling his story.  It is an interesting one and you can't blame him for trying `capture the magic' of the first three films.  Of course, that didn't happen but we did get a good movie out of it.     This film had an exciting story and a lot of pretty pictures.  I don't know if all the animation was necessary but it wasn't overly distracting.  I gave this movie a 7 because it's good.  It's not great but it's definitely ahead of the curve.     Many blast this movie calling it `truly horrible in every aspect' or saying the pod race was to `apease uncultured masses that are hungry for action no matter how absurd'.  Considering there are movies out there like `The Fast and the Furious', `Rollerball' and `Collateral Damage' I think calling Star Wars Episode I the worst movie ever is way out of line. 
   I also think knocking this movie for having `action' is ridiculous. While I do agree that over-the-top, everything-blows-up type movies are silly, this movie IS a space adventure.  Things SHOULD go `woosh', `boom' and `zap'.  In fact, the special effects are a huge contribution to the legitimacy and appeal of the original movies.  Besides, movies tell stories with moving pictures, without action you might as well make a radio play. 
   As far as this movie having `blatant racism'. with Soul Brother Jar-Jar and the `devious but clumsy mechanations of the evil Asain trade guild'Get a life.   One potentially valid comment I've heard is `the biggest movie disappointment of my moviegoing life'.  With all the Star Wars hype, this movie was bound for disappointment unless it had a cameo from Jesus and included a free Super Bowl ticket.   I liked this movie.",7,0,1,21 May 2002
Friday Night Lights," Un-clichéd Sports Movie
","Thi is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. It had the honesty of 'Slapshot' and the heart of 'Rocky'. It wasn't just a team-trying-to-win-the-big-game movie. The characters were interesting without being melodramatic (no sinister villains vs. sparkling good-guys). You'll learn a lot about how seriously they take high school football in Texas. Their stadium really seats 19,000! Apparently they left out the fact that this high school team took a chartered jet to two away games in 1988. It doesn't ridicule or judge, it just shows a variety of points of view, from the pure fun of the game to absurdity of hero-worship. You get a good balanced message of enjoying sports but not letting them rule your life.Also, Billy Bob Thornton and Tim McGraw are great.",9,1,3,21 February 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," It's a War Movie, not so much a Fairy Tale.
","Most of the blame for being mislead should fall on the poster 'key art' designers and trailer editors. It's marketed as a 'Grown Up Fairy Tale' but it's mostly a war movie - OK POST-war movie about fascists, guerrillas, the horrors of war and such.It's not so much a mystical fantasy tale. I'd say that takes up about 12 minutes of the whole movie, which is really unsatisfying if that's what you've come to see.For what it is though, it's a decent movie. Over the top violent but that seems to be the whole point of a girl trying to escape it all.There were a couple 'WHY DID (or DIDN'T) YOU DO THAT!?' moments while watching. Those are frustrating to me but I think most people can get past them as I came up with a couple justifications.So, don't go looking for a fantastical, magical tale. Be ready for war and sadness.",6,2,5,16 January 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Get traumatized!
","Often when I see a horror movie I wonder, 'Who molested the writer/director?' I don't ask because of specific scenes, though a few could make the case. I ask because the genre in general is depraved and nasty. Even if the good guys win, you figure they'll be traumatized for life. On the other hand, going through hell and surviving would be very empowering. Maybe I'm a pessimist.That said, the behavior of the hill people was very believable. The movie was certainly scary but for me it was more depressing and lonely. I mean, it's bad enough to go on a family trip in the middle of the desert but to be attacked by inbred nuclear test rejects is even worse!I'm still not sure why the bad guys have to be so elaborately malicious (other than entertainment value) if they're only trying to survive but whatever.So, as far as the genre goes, not horrible but not my thing.",3,2,5,13 March 2006
Spider-Man," Swinging Fun
","I've never left a movie saying 'I sure would like more explosions and punching!'  but the action was very appealing in this movie and I actually thought there could be more.I remember Batman coming out in 1989 and the way it made a superhero fresh, new and exciting.  I'm not a comic book fan but I was glad to see Spider-Man getting the same treatment.With what little I know, this movie did do the comic justice.  Now that effects allow more superhuman powers for the actors, Spider-Man's jumping and swinging come off very well done.  Think about it, Spider-Man isn't just flying straight ahead.  You can't put some guy on a table in front of a blue screen to pull off the dramatic arcing motions of swinging from building to building 20 stories off the ground.  The effects here were well done.  It was especially impressive that the movie's action often took place in broad daylight with no dark shadows available to hide wires or distract the viewer from mediocre tricks. The story was clear from the start when Peter Parker said it's about a girl. This is a love story and it doesn't suck like the love story that bogged down Independence Day and other Hollywood 'blockbusters'.  The plot is full of soap opera like twists and triangles (though 'soap opera' is not a fair term).  Tobey MacGuire is convincing as a superhero because he's convincing as the alter ego, Parker, from the start.  Willem Dafoe is a great villain. His hard features and gravely voice are perfect for a comic book bad-guy.Hey, I liked the action scenes and the overall look of this film.  It's a very pretty movie with a cool story!",8,0,0,8 May 2002
This Is Spinal Tap," Smell the Glove!
","The humor of 'This is Spinal Tap' has a special time-release formula.  I didn't find myself rolling on the floor laughing the first time I saw this but as the day went on my friends and I couldn't stop recalling the dialogue.  This movie is a legend.     'See Spinal Tap' should be written in the dictionary next to satire. Lately satire has come to mean a simple mockery of pop-culture instead of 'human vice or folly attacked through irony, derision or wit'.  Movies like 'Scary Movie' claim to be parodies or satire without even trying to be witty.  They just imitate something as opposed to commenting on it.  True satire takes a bit more work by the writers and will make you laugh much harder.   Spinal Tap gives you the absurdity of the rock and roll world, yet still respects the music.  I understood this when I saw a clip of the movie for the first time at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It was the scene with amps that go to '11'.  I couldn't stop thinking about that scene until I finally saw the movie.  Every aspect of the music world is lampooned; arrogance, absurdity, backstage crybabies, has-beenism, volume, even the Beatles.  This movie is quoted like the Simpsons, which isn't always good but certainly proof of legendary movie.  It's dry, deadpan humor and it may take a day to sink in but this movie is hilarious.",10,80,89,5 November 2002
This Is Spinal Tap," It's One Louder
","I wonder if the actors playing Nigel Tufnel, Derek Smalls and David St. Hubbins wandered the set without ever breaking character.  Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean become their hard-rocking alter-egos for the documentary of a ficticious rock band.  They know their characters so well, that they even do performances and interviews (NPR's 'All Things Considered' had a good one) as these characters.The movie features expected and unexpected cameos from Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey (a non-speaking mime), Fred Willard and Paul Schaffer in a story that spoofs every silly aspect of the rock star life.  It's so funny because it closely parallels the quirks of rock star lifestyle (as seen on TV, since I've never been one) and performances.  From the petty backstage gripes; such as improperly sized bread and bologna, to the grand failure of a melodramatic creative vision.  It takes all the crap you see on a 'VH1 Behind The Music' and makes fun of it.The songs are hilarious, and the memorable lines will be quoted from now to eternity.I'd also reccomend 'Waiting For Guffman' (a similar tale revolving around community theater in the fictional town of Blaine, MO) and 'Best in Show'. Both of these feature Fred Willard, who is hilarious, in a more visible role.  There's also a great Saturday Night Live skit you can probably find on any SNL Sports special.  It features Martin Short, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest in the quest for a men's olympic synchronized swimming competition.But I digress...When I first saw Spinal Tap it took a day or two for me to realize how hilarious it was.  I noticed myself quoting lines, and finding parallels between the absurdity in the movie and absurdity in real life. It gets better every time I see it.Rock.",10,0,1,29 October 2001
Grindhouse," The Graceland of Movies
","Let me explain that. Elvis' Graceland mansion is a clear example of white trash striking it rich. Grindhouse is 70s B-Movie Fanboys strike it rich and get to do all the 'over the top' effects they've always wanted. OK, and before we go on, if I never hear 'cheezy' 'B-Movie' 'over the top' or 'gratutious' again, I might be happy. These words are appropriate here but they're as overdone as the greaser guys hanging out at rockabilly clubs. It's also strange to do a tribute to that 'genre' since the words used to describe super gory, 'over the top' Grindhouse type movies have long been excuses for bad writing or a half-assed idea. Just add more explosions! Kind of like a comic who adds f-bombs and n-words.The movies themselves are fun; Planet Terror being the better of the two. Death Proof is just a lot of talking with some car chases. It feels like what a Quentin Tarantino fan would make in film school. Unlike Pulp Fiction, which threw out tasty nuggets of trivia and strange conversation, Death Proof is just people taking a long time to say something.No real new ideas here or super-clever humor. Just a rehashing of old movies with a wink so you know they're in on the joke too...which ironically makes these movies sincere tributes. If you are a film school nerd or are like Quentin Tarantino and sat in your basement pleasing yourself to crappy movies in the 70s OR you missed all of that but really like explosions and naked chicks and car chases, hey, this movie is for you. It's gaudy. It's a rehash but unique to current movies, which makes the movie ironic at it's core. And Rose McGowan has a gun for a leg, so that's neat. It's not bad.",7,2,5,8 April 2007
Gangs of New York," Cool Top Hats
","This movie was long.  Too long for me.I did like the costumes and sets though.  Those top hats with the blue sashes looked awesome.  Great sets and a disturbing story made Old Tymey New York a beautiful 19th century nightmare.What people did to each other back then was pretty sick.  I'm sure we've got some nasty stuff now too but I never imagined it on such a large scale. Scorcese is always the guy to dredge up the most disgusting human behavior. While I appreciate seeing the dark side I never knew about, I wondered if he can direct anything NOT about organized crime.The story, to me, really wandered.  I wasn't sure what Leonardo was trying to do and I don't think he was either.  We've all felt that way about ourselves but when it's time for the movie to build to a climax, I don't think it should seem so spontaneous and vague.  The story made it tough to love or hate any of the characters.  Very lukewarm.Daniel Day Lewis did a great job playing a murderous jerkwad.This was a great looking movie.  But the story was long and vague.",6,0,0,2 January 2003
