Your Name.," Movie of the year
","Your Name is one of my favorite movies of all time and will always have a special place in my heart. Its animation, soundtrack, story, everything about it is just amazing and something barely seen. The Idea that the two main characters switch bodies every once in a while is something almost never seen in anime and it pulls it off perfectly. It has one of the biggest twists and a very satisfying ending that will keep you on your toes for the whole of part 2 just to get to it. You can tell that there was an immense amount of effort and passion put into this film and I beg you to watch this masterpiece.",10,12,16,31 January 2018
