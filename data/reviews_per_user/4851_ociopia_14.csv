Blade Runner 2049," When there is no hope
","In the original Blade Runner, which was wonderful, Harrison Ford was really just an affable dick, a sort of monovision hired killer cop who slowly came to question his job. My sympathy was not with him but with the replicants he assassinated. And I was mesmerized by the tone and the visuals, dark and filled with pathos.Jump 35 years and our world is closer to this awful dystopian vision, run by heartless corporations, our planet beginning its death throws. It isn't hard to jump another 35 years and see us arriving somewhere bleak. Several times I found myself thinking that I'm not sure this future would be a world that would be worth living in at all. Yes, we are adaptable, to our triumph and sorrow, and we can throw out quality of life on a dime if we must. But must we?The new Blade Runner keeps the tone, which is probably the most important part of this series and of Dick's book, somber, sorrowful, hopeless, bleak, depressing – this is no joy ride. These are stories about the search for and discovery of something that the central character must have, though they don't even realize they are on a search, but they are. They live in a world with no justice, kindness or hope to it or about it, so what's left, the search for their own humanity, which is ultimately what gives any life its meaning.The plot is excellent. I won't go into it. There are great performances by Gosling and de Armas but especially by Sylvia Hoeks, who is fabulous in her ability to be dispassionate and intense at the same time. She is a great villain with dead eyes that cry. Gosling is stunning as always. I felt he actually held his face in a specific way, erasing how sexually appealing he is and replacing that with a 'lost, innocent Haley Joel Osment in A.I. quality' that just knocked me flat. Gosling is a fabulous actor. I love how still he can be and then just erupt. Scary.De Armas is lovely and convincing. Wonderful to watch. There is an extraordinary scene where she melds with a 'real' person in a way that is mesmerizing. I love Ridley Scott. Just love him. So many of his movies are my favorite. I don't know how Denis Villeneuve did it but he created a fantastic movie with the right everything, every bit as good as Scott's original vision but making this his own. I've never seen a movie he directed but he's obviously a master.The soundtrack can't be overstated for its impact. It's a screeching, scathing scorch of harsh rotting industry, like a dragon machine in death throws, loud loud loud. Go see it in a big theater now.",10,1,9,23 October 2017
Walk the Line," Hot. You heard it , sexy and hot!
","I don't need to say much. Reese Witherspoon is excellent. She is a fun June, delicate in body but filled with confidence and spirit. Reese is great cast against Joaquin because she is so slight. He is 5'8' and certainly not the height which helped Johnny Cash command his audience. What is Joaquin Phoenix? He is magnificent, gorgeous, and hot, hot, hot. OMG, he manages to look at June/Reese with the adoration that Ewan McGregor gave Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, except it isn't innocent. It smolders with passion and yearning. Where did he come from? This isn't the little creep from To Die For. This isn't the smarmy creep from Gladiator. This is a complex, brooding, fascinating man that would be worth the trouble to get next to, and trouble he is, in spades. Oh, and the singing? It's fabulous.",10,2,4,20 November 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," lovely, touching, deeply satisfying
","I went with trepidations, figuring Tilda Swinton would be wonderful and the rest would be so-so. I was delighted to be wrong. The movie really hinges on the four children, they are the center. I thought it was extremely well-cast and acted. I can't remember the actors names but Lucy is enchanting, Peter is noble, Susan is a difficult role as the practical, spoil-sport so I can't say she was marvelous, but really Edmund is where everything revolves.This Edmund was really great. I was able to care about him and hope for him in a way I never did in the book. Kudos to the kids.In the book, Mr. Tumnus was pivotal, even if briefly seen, and the movie's Mr. Tumnus was delightfully sweet and touching. There's a special scene between he and Lucy that is inventive and wonderful.Aslan - impossible really to capture as he is a concept. I felt the facial expression was so true to the sense of sorrow that Aslan carries but I was not fond of Liam Neesan's voice. Somehow that did not work for me, nor did the voice of the wolf.But Aslan does convey goodness and it's transitory nature and the end brought that home so well. While many seem to believe this is a Christian-themed movie, I think whatever you believe will work because the themes of good and evil, nobility and sacrifice are universal and symbolic.A beautiful movie that I highly recommend to those who love adventure, fantasy and myth.",10,8,12,17 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Extraordinary
","This must be a breakthrough film. It certainly is for me. I was not expecting such depth and quality. Being 60 and from Oklahoma, the hardscrabble life of no hope and make do resonated too close. I remember those 'the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation' people. Ang Lee manages to get them to emote. At one point I thought, 'no wonder we have sex between men and women - otherwise there wouldn't be any communication at all.' And between men and men? Just the way they rarely look each other in the eye. Unbelievably wrenching. Heath Ledger is brilliant. There is no other word for it. Mute, muffled, and mumbling, he is the everyman of the everyday man, haunting in the separateness of being male. Jake G. manages to light a fire inside Heath's character, but every spark is eventually blown out by the bleakness, only to be rekindled with their reunions. This is love as survival. Don't miss it. You will be awakened.",10,35,43,3 January 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Exquisitely realized
","Pan's Labyrinth manages to be a number of things, beyond visually stunning and stunningly imaginative. It could be a bookend to 'For Whom The Bell Tolls,' showing the day-to-day pressure and horrors of the army Pablo and Pilar were fighting, the army mirroring the sadistic brutality, with a peculiar lyrical beauty, of the Third Riech. Serqi Lopez is brilliant as the army's tormented and almost mechanically sadistic leader, as though he is acting from compulsions beyond himself. I thought his performance one of academy award level, like taking The Good The Bad and The Ugly's tormented evil leader who keeps listening to the melody in his pocket watch and turning him into a real character, played by a brilliant actor. This is a movie, in and of itself.Then comes the young girl who is thrust into this men's world - truly a world where the vulnerable have no place or chance - and she is filled with fear for herself and her pregnant mother, the new wife of the violent army leader. This movie is dark. It is about the underworld, those parts of life and as well as the self that we wish to remain hidden, the places we are pulled down and into. Most movies portray that part of life thru awful and flat movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the like, focusing only on the terror. This movie is lushly full - a true masterpiece of realism, told as a fantasy.This young girl lives in a world of fairy tale books and suddenly, a magical portal to another world opens - an ancient and equally violent world, yet in it she has power, bravery, importance and the opportunity to become a princess. She does not question its validity or rules or her role. Instead, she puts on the mantle of hero and takes up a frightening quest, given to her by an ancient and eerie faun, whose intentions are unclear. Is he good? Is he evil? Is he beyond either? He will give her three tasks, and if she fulfills them, she will become a princess in a place of ancient magic - all this is beyond our understanding, of course.In many fairy tales, a quest of 'you must fulfill these tasks or' is given and the hero, along the way, encounters the most horrible of events, and seems emotionally very removed from them, as though he is sleepwalking toward his destiny as he encounters and slays monsters and men. The brutality that goes with the quest is dulled. Think of Arthur and the deaths of his knights, as an example. Or, brutality is embodied by Orcs and the like, so the realism of the brutality is diluted into parody. Del Torres's brilliance is how he circumvents this by having the present be so horrifying, thus constantly pulling the princess/hero back into the world in which she has no power.Lush, layered, rich and imaginative, while real, brutal, dark and terrifying - this is an extraordinary movie, to be experienced in a theater.",10,3,7,29 January 2007
American Hustle," An American Tragedy
","American Hustle is a great movie. It's no surprise that it's nominated for Academy Awards in Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Supporting Actor and Actress. It's that good. I've fallen in love with the director, David O. Russell. Christian Bale 'is' his character and though he's repulsive, forty-five minutes in you've come to care about him. By the end, you feel deeply. How he inhabits this character is the definition of an academy award performance. Amy Adams is subtle, brazen and luscious. Bradley Cooper, so manic and over- the-top, he is just nuts. Jennifer Lawrence nailed her part. I mean just jaw-dropping nailed it. Mesmerizing. All of it is mesmerizing, from the costumes to the dialogue, through plot and the ploy. Oh boy. American Hustle is a snapshot of a cultural phenomenon that occurred in the 70's in America. Sure, it's about some con artists and a sting operation paralleling Abscam. But it's much more.In America today, people become famous by taking videos of themselves having sex and posting them on the internet. The rest of America seems to want to watch those videos. Then those new 'stars' have a reality TV show. We're in an age of the cult of me where someone is famous for being nobody and their main talent is they think are somebody. American Hustle reflects the time when the cult of me was beginning. Unless you lived in the 50's, it's impossible to imagine how conservative America was with women in girdles, shirtwaist dresses and pumps and Leave It To Beaver and Father Knows Best representing what Americans thought was ideal. Twin beds for married couples on TV and in movies. Many folks had left rural American and come to cities for jobs but things were still pastoral and provincial. The war was over and we were living in the American dream. But it was stultifying and stresses converged. The Vietnam War, the Birth Control Pill, lots more women in the workplace, a rise in divorce and latchkey children and much more. America started having a social fit, like a snake, it began to shake off the strictures of the 40's and 50's, up pops the 60's and real social upheaval. Sex, drugs and rock n' roll cogently says it.Our egos were filled with the right to self expression and that was the ultimate goal, to be an individual and to be free. Of course that didn't work out exactly as envisioned. This is what American Hustle reflects. This is the understory that we see, throbbing behind the plot.Start with personal vanity. Bale's pitifully hilarious, glued comb-over. Cooper's perm-rod acquired afro, Adam's plunging, breast-revealing necklines and Lawrence's nail obsession, capped by the fruity, rotten top coat, so Freudian. The four main characters are far away from 'down home, plain, no-nonsense' America of the 40's, 'decent, aren't we all innocent, hard workers' America of the 50's and even from the 'peace, love, turn-on and tune-out' of the 60's. They have entered 'we are all movie stars or rock gods, whether wanna-be or full tilt.' This is Saturday Night Fever told about adults. This is glam rock gone wild, where even the men are obsessed with their hair. The characters are slick and smart, the dialogue 'Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf' caustic and the movie incredibly styled, successfully, from set to costume to manner. I felt transported back in time in the disco scene, reminiscent at Amy's lovely breast-teasing outfits. This was what it was really like 'back in the day,' though the 'plot' of the con game and Abscam were not part of it for most, but certainly not so far removed either. Everything was loosened, for good or bad. It just fell where it might. That made it fascinating. That is what American Hustle so deftly depicts. Self-will run riot, damn the consequences.I have read many reviews of the movie. Most called it a comedy. I would hardly call it that. Certainly there are comedic moments, but primarily it is a tragedy, an American tragedy that still reverberates.",10,1,4,17 January 2014
The Aviator," Wonderful film and a must see!
","Truly a spectacular in the sense of capturing the essence of an age and of Hughes himself. While not factual in its day-to-day of Hughes' life, the film reveals the man in his genius, obsessions and eventual decline. Scorsese and DiCaprio are to be congratulated.The gorgeous and extraordinarily well-acted (by DiCaprio) movie moves through the highlights of Hughes' accomplishments in film and especially aviation. Without Hughes, American aviation would not be what it is today. His bold vision, deep pockets and ability to follow his grand dreams allowed him to create on an incredible scale.Howard Hughes was a American original as well as an American tragic hero. DiCaprio might play Hughes as more personable than he ever was, that is impossible to know. But I came away no longer just thinking of Hughes as a tragic freak, but instead truly admiring him while having tremendous compassion for his mental illness. What a life!",10,12,20,22 January 2005
Drive," A must see. Subdued masterpiece of violence.
","I think most directors are afraid of losing an audience's attention, as 'sound-bite' as the world has become. I award bravery married to timing, tone and that rare commodity, allowing actors faces to nuance a role. This is a paced movie that stays slow and builds at the same time. Something more common in a horror film. Tension. Kudos to director Nicolas Refn.Drive is a surprise. I didn't realize Ryan Gosling acted this well. Perfectly cast because of his look of innocent boyishness, not too handsome but nice to look at, he could be anybody you've known who's a pleasant guy.In this movie he is, you assume, an introverted and lonely man, completely wedded to all things cars. He is a master craftsman of driving, be it stunts or race tracks, chases or get aways. We don't really know what is going on inside him as we watch his character respond to a very odd set of circumstances put before him. He steps outside of his comfort zone and he falls for a neighbor, Carey Mulligan, whose husband is in prison. She has a son he also adores. But it is restrained. They barely speak. They look at each other. Volumes of desire.Loser husband gets out and owes big money to bad people who beat him up and give him one chance to get their money. He has to rob a pawn shop for them. Gosling offers to help as the getaway driver, doing the only thing he knows how to do in order to ensure the wife's safety.Things go bad. It's a set up. At this point, we realize that in every scene, things get deeper and deeper, more out of the element of this man who drives. He carries no gun. He isn't a 'wise guy.' He is gentle. Restrained. Careful. Cautious. Yet he rises seamlessly to each situation. We notice how aware he is of every person, every car, and we realize he has had some experience of which we know nothing and we begin to wonder what he did before he showed up five years ago to become a grease monkey, get-away car driver, wanna be race car driver. But I didn't think about it too much, the movie was too engrossing.All of this is played softly, subdued. Gosling probably only says 15 sentences. Maybe 20 tops. Mulligan, reminding me a lot of Michelle Williams, probably says about the same. The plot is interesting but not of major importance. A man of few words, he is an action person. All of a sudden, we have swung over into The Man With No Name territory. But it's so low key the only action is violence. Major stomp your head into a rotten tomato violence. Whoa. Where did that come from?Albert Brooks is a cheap hood who has become a nice guy but is actually a professional killer and a cheap hood. Ron Pearlman is his partner who knows he's a cheap hood. They're a nice foil. Brooks probably has the most lines, as is apropos. But everything comes to a head, of course. And you are left wondering . . . who is this driver guy? It is a beautiful movie and you should see it.",9,2,5,3 July 2012
Avatar," A privilege to watch.
","At the movies' end, as the credits rolled, what came to mind was, 'A privilege to watch such beauty.' I don't know what a person who doesn't love fantasy and sci fi will bring to or take away from Cameron's masterpiece. I've loved both genre's all my life and read most major works and seen all major television and film with fantasy and sci fi themes.Avatar is as good as it gets. It is stunning. Thrilling. It is not original as really nothing can be anymore. But instead, Cameron has distilled fascinating themes and recreated them through his own vision.There's much reminiscent of so many things there's no point in even speaking of them. But in the end, Avatar speaks for itself directly to the viewer's heart. It is an emotional film, filled with tender nuance and exquisite visual beauty, as well as wildly-rolling excitement, violence and turmoil.It packs a big punch to the synapses on a number of levels, be it racial dna memory or merely guilt at what we do to one another and then segues over to the deep, mystical longing for the Mother as the mystery of Earth and Unity and our loss of touch to her.I kept wondering why it was named Avatar. That is such a wonderful invention of Cameron's.Enough of that - let's get to flying on dragons. OMG it is glorious.A gorgeous surprise, you will love this film unless you're dead.",10,5,11,24 December 2009
The Wrestler," Sorrow revealed frame-by-frame
","Most reviews discuss this movie as a plot and performances. But I experienced it as a metaphor, almost as though someone said, 'Let's make a movie based on Thoreau's 'The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,' but make it contemporary and gutty-engrossing.There's no real back story, beyond '20 years ago this guy was a famous wrestler,' and 'this guy is estranged from his daughter because basically he was an absent jerk-of-a-father,' and 'this pitiful guy lives in a ghastly trailer and is even locked out of that because he can't pay the rent.' Just those bare bones allow the viewer to create a huge past, knowing The Ram lives his life focused on former glory while unconscious to, but skirting with, the reality that it was built on mountains of detritus from his sacrificed life. He is a Gladiator in a very Roman sense. He is a prisoner and both a real and symbolic sacrificial figure, mired in an arena where pain has wedded fame. And though he is still stuck, he's over the hill in absolutely every way.When he suffers a heart attack and has a by-pass, which creates a permanent side-line of 'you may no longer be The Wrestler,' the viewer already knows he will enter the ring again. This is a man who has lived a life filled with choices, as every man has, and you realize that he has made the wrong choice at every turn. Now his life has narrowed to a desperate parody of former fame. He's a has-been who barely ever was, he knows it, he lives it, it oozes out of every pore, his emotional agony resonates in his every pain-wracked breath. He's an excruciating example of 'you reap what you sow' and that is what makes this film universal, not unlike 'A Christmas Carol.' Roarke's extraordinary performance captures you from the beginning, drawing you into his world, which is haunted by lost dreams from which he can't escape, humiliations which have piled so high he can no longer be anything but humble and wry, yet he bulls on, shooting up steroids, washing down pain-killers, both of which are again metaphors for his loss of power and his tortured soul.He's a gentle, narcissistic man who has focused his entire will on being The Ram, a huge physical presence of strength and power. But his real name is Robin and the sweet, vulnerable bird inside him has few feathers left. He's human, aging, desperately alone, wants love, to be connected, to on some level be a part of the regular world. In this way, he is no different from any addict or alcoholic or workaholic or actor/fame-seeker wanna-be, anybody who has wandered down a path of Self that is destructive and filled with denial. He is Every Failed Man times twelve.The sorrow of the film is palpable. It is sublime in its realization. Mickey Rourke is genius.",10,1,2,12 January 2009
WALL·E," Too close for comfort yet wonderful
","On the surface, a precious movie about an antiquated robot survivor (WALL-E)who is contented but lonely as the only 'living' thing left surviving on an earth that's turned into a trash heap, other than a cockroach pal who follows him around but has little interaction. No talking, just a cute guy who likes to replay an old 'Hello Dolly' tape and do the music as he works away at his prime directive of functioning as a sophisticated trash compactor.Arrive a spaceship, which deposits a very sophisticated robot, shaped like a white egg with detached head and arms and huge blue sensor-eyes. WALL-E's in love! Okay - that's all precious and off they go to space and have adventures and it is wonderful. The other reviews will describe all of this. Oh and the movie is preceded by what I take as a cartoon - something I sorely miss. And the cartoon is marvelous. A magician and his very clever and hungry rabbit. You'll love it.But back to WALL-E. And the true story, which is the understory.It is depressingly visionary, not unlike 1984. Human's consumerism has destroyed the earth, which is a vast, lifeless wasteland, populated by huge heaps of garbage. Where are the people? They've taken off 700 years before in a gigantic spaceship, leaving the robots (all of which have ceased to function but WALL-E) to clean up their mess. Billboard style signs litter the trash dumps, entreating people to buy, buy, buy.It appears that all the big-box stores are finally owned by one company and they wanted all, got all, but had no place to put the refuse and the refuse gobbled up the planet's resources, along with the consumerism demands. Very dishearteningly believable. No birds, no animals, no people, no life on our precious planet.Jump to the big space ship in the sky. Humans now, due to lack of real gravity (ha ha ha), spend their time drinking computer-generated concoctions and everyone is a fat blimp, unable to walk and supported/living in floating air-cushioned chair-beds with computer screens in front of their faces that also seem to serve as cell phones. They are all numb, dumb and it is eerie in the similarity of going to a big mall and listening to loads of fat people talking on cells phones while they eat fast food.The computers have really taken over, nothing new or original in that. And the story really goes nowhere that isn't predictable. It is the subtext that punches the gut in its predictive doomsday which dovetails today's reality that multi-nationals now rule the world instead of countries, that we are held in the clutches of our own consumerism/addiction to having and eating more and using all the planets resources to accomplish it and yet numb and oblivious to the inevitable outcome.Very brave of Pixar to do this. It's sort of an Al Gore comedy/tragedy that's wonderful done.",10,2,7,28 June 2008
Vanilla Sky," Excellent if you like a real mystery.
","If you like to be confused and not really know what is going on, you will love this mystery/science-fiction story. It starts out as a superficial movie about trendy, shallow people and segues into a nightmare where reality and fantasy mix with dreams until no one really knows what is happening inside or outside the movie.Completely different, but not unlike Memento. It is really dark and complex. Take Arnold in that science fiction movie with Sharon Stone - the one where he doesn't even know who he is, mix it with Spellbound and the other old Gregory Peck movie where he has amnesia and the General is after him, and you have a taste of Vanilla Sky. The first 20 minutes is tough, just get through it. You will love it after that as it starts to unfold like an origami puzzle. Really clever.",8,0,1,2 January 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," Very mixed bag but great ending
","Nolan is a fabulous director. But I felt like I was watching Batman/Bruce Wayne having a boring pity party and then pit against The Humungous Amongst Us from Mad Max, another orphanish pity party but his all insane rage that made absolutely no sense, even to the plot, even to the ending. And all a bit too darn cliché. And both Batman and Bain from the League of whatever? And Marion Cotillard, always gorgeous and competent. But I don't care whatsoever about that League and Liam Neeson and all of it. Total nonsense. So I would say I thought the plot/script quite weak while the acting was quite good. Anne Hathaway is excellent and brings sophistication, beauty and much needed humor. I loved her take on Catwoman best because she is a woman, not a woman turned into a lunatic Catwoman. I love Christian Bale. I just kept thinking, 'I bet he wishes he was cast as Bain and had a juicy role.' This is a role he can neither sink his teeth into nor save and it must kill him.That being said, it is very difficult to wear a mask and have an altered voice, as Bain does, and be anything other than a big hunk of talking meat. I found him very boring. I mean come on, Heath Ledger as The Joker was entrancing. Who cares about the Wrestling TV Big Masked Freak?Joseph Gordon Levitt was solid. Michael Caine wonderful. Morgan Freeman always great. Gary Oldman is good, having little to do.I thought the gadgets were pretty cool. I thought the police being set up to be massacred over and over was just ridiculous. Please. Are we morons?Okay - so I've gretched. The last 40 minutes gets really good. From Batman in the prison on is great. The ending is a huge surprise and excellent. Worth it just to see it.",6,2,8,26 July 2012
Casino Royale," Fabulous
","I've grown up with the Bonds, always loving Sean Connery as the ultimate sexy killer. I adore Pierce, Roger, and Timothy as actors and have enjoyed them in many roles but never felt that any of the three was James Bond as I could not seriously believe any of them to be a killer. Now comes Daniel Craig. Wow. Double 007 Wow. His flawed good looks project rugged and gutty masculinity, his blue eyes fly up in that rarefied Peter O'Toole and Paul Newman sky and he's a gifted actor. And obviously the screen play was great, as well as the directing.What really brought this movie to excellence was the lovely Eva Green and the depth of relationship allowed between her and James. Instead of a vapid little sex kitten, as are most Bond women, Eva is a person.Now don't misunderstand, the gorgeous sexual repartee is there and the chemistry smolders.Gone are the silly 1960's sexist junk lines and the over-done gadgets. Instead, we have cell phone and laptop wonders that mirror today's world. And we have a flawed hero who is quite complex. Quite fine.Craig runs about 20 marathons in this movie, is by far the most physical in action and interaction of any Bond, doesn't come off as arrogant or sarcastic but instead - he's a man. A delicious man. Plot? Irrelevant. Go see it.",10,1,2,26 November 2006
