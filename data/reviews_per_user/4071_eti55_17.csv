Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You Thought the Ewoks Were Lame?
","The little teddy bears from Jedi were actually pretty cool when compared to Jar Jar Binks, the single worst character in the history of the Star Wars franchise. He's even more annoying than Hayden Christenson's Anakin Skywalker, which is saying a LOT. This was the first Star Wars movie where George Lucas brought in what were essentially cartoon characters, and there were times I didn't know whether I was watching a Star Wars movie or a space alien version of Roger Rabbit. I have the same complaint about this flick as I have about the other two 'prequels.' Poor acting (except of course for the great Liam Neeson), boring characters (kind of goes with the bad acting, but also with poor character development), banal dialog, and a plot that takes a backseat to all those neat effects coming out of Skywalker Ranch. Plus there are too many unnecessary characters, Jar Jar being a prime example. But also, Liam Neeson notwithstanding, the Qui Gon character didn't need to be there either. They could have had Neeson play Obi Wan..he certainly would have been more interesting than Ewan McGregor, and Neeson's age was more in line with where Obi Wan's would have been 30 years earlier, given how old Obi Wan looked in the first Star Wars. Mcgregor was too young looking, which hurt the story's continuity. Ditto Anakin Skywalker. He should already have been a teenager at this stage. That said, as much as Jake Lloyd got panned for his performance, I actually thought the kid did OK with what he had to work with (especially when held up next to Christenson in the subsequent flicks). There were also unnecessary plot devices which added nothing to the story (i.e. Padme's 'double.') The bottom line is that I didn't care much about what happened to any of the characters. No amount of action and dazzling computer effects can make up for that (I had the same problem with the old Battlestar Galactica, which had Star Wars type of effects, but again, characters that did not draw me in). On the plus side, besides Liam Neeson, one of the finest actors of his generation (like Alec Guinness, he can take boring dialog and make it interesting), Phantom Menace has the single best light saber sequence in the history of the franchise. You don't realize how slow and lumbering the sword fights in the first three movies are until you see the Mach I pacing in this one. Other than the fact that he looks like a multi-horned Satan, Darth Maul is actually pretty bland until you see him fight..ninja style with his double ended light saber. Fun stuff.Overall, Phantom isn't bad..but it could have been better.",6,0,3,5 January 2013
Spider-Man 2," A Worthy Sequel
","Spidey is back, and this time he's battling Dr. Octopus (aka Dr. Otto Octavius, played by Alfred Molina). Doc Ock is transformed via a nuclear fusion experiment that goes horribly wrong, fusing 4 virtually indestructible mechanical arms to his nervous system via his spinal cord..and destroying the inhibitor chip which prevents them from controlling his mind. You see Peter Parker back once again as a hard-on-his luck geek, when he's not chasing bad guys. The problem is that all that time chasing crooks has left him exhausted..to the point where he's failing in college and can't hold a job (and as such can't keep up on his rent at the dive where he lives). He's still hung up on Mary Jane, who, much to Parker's chagrin, is now dating J. Jonah Jameson's astronaut son. His buddy Harry Osbourne is still obsessed with getting back at Spider-man for the death of his father. And Aunt May's home is in foreclosure. All these distractions get to Peter, and he finds that his spider powers aren't always working (and they pick some really bad moments to go out on him).Spider-man 2 has generally been reviewed more favorably than the first installment. I disagree. It's got great visual effects, but it's a bit tedious in places. When the action does get going, it's great, but there's a LOT of talking in this movie..too much (except for the parts featuring the insufferable Jameson, once again played perfectly by J.K. Simmons). And Spidey 2 doubles down on the 'Peter Parker's a hard-luck nerd' angle. OK, first off, he wasn't that nerdy in the comic (I know, I'm being picky here, but nonetheless), but even assuming he was, it gets to the point where it's enough already..we get it. There's one scene in particular where Peter's heading for class (late, as usual) and is constantly getting knocked over and walked on by the other students. Part of that was to emphasize how exhausted he was from chasing bad guys, but still, it was too much.All criticisms aside, this is still definitely a superior effort as super hero movies go. All the performances are good. Alfred Molina does a fine job as the doomed Dr. Octavius. The effects are VERY good. There's a lot of CGI, but it actually isn't done to the point where it looks like a video game. Doc Ock's mechanical arms in particular look frighteningly real.Overall, a fine follow-up to my favorite comic super-hero movie. 8.5",8,0,1,23 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Star Wars Begins its Descent
","I have several problems with this third installment in the Star Wars story (OK, to the Star Wars geeks, the 6th installment). As much as I can't stand those awful Ewoks, the worst part about this Star Wars is a script that sucks the life out of the main characters..especially Han Solo (you get the sense that being in carbon freeze for who-knows-how- long softened his brain). Luke's no fun anymore either. Hamill tries too hard to sound like Alec Guinness as Obi Wan did in the first one, and it doesn't work. Then there's the emperor, who is not just evil, but obviously a narcissistic a-hole who loves to hear himself talk. In several scenes he says pretty much the same annoying stuff (telling Luke that Luke now serves him, blah blah). I think the audience got the point the first time he said it. There are basically two parts to this one. The first is Han Solo's rescue from Jabba the Hut, which is great once it gets going. The problem is that it seems to take forever and a day to get going. Then there's the attack on the new Death Star, with three different scenarios: the actual attack with the fighters, the raid on the forest moon to get the shield down, and Luke's confrontation with Vader and the emperor. The scenes with the fighters attacking the Death Star were certainly involved. George Lucas threw everything but the kitchen sink in effects-wise, to the point where I felt bombarded by it all. It was too much. Then you have the Endor scene, which had those stupid Ewoks (what the hell was Lucas thinking?), but also had a really cool 'motorcycle speeder' chase scene. And then you have the confrontation with Luke and the head bad guys. Luke probably wasn't very happy to find out that the emperor could do more than fight with a sword..he can also shoot what amounts to lightning bolts from his fingers. But does Yoda warn Luke about this? Noooooo, Yoda simply says the cryptic, 'do not underestimate the powers of the emperor.' Lucas (and Richard Marquand, who directed) were obviously going for full-on drama in the Vader/Skywalker/Emperor confrontation, where Vader is as conflicted as Luke, if not more so. It doesn't work well. The sword fighting is fun, but the emperor's pontificating just gets tedious. And Vader is nowhere near as much fun as a good guy.For all its faults, Jedi still manages to be an entertaining movie..better than any of the 'prequels' which would follow years later.",7,0,1,6 February 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Check Your Brain at the Door
","OK, you would think that by now I would have grown up a bit. Haven't I had enough of mindless car chases and smoking hot scantily clad girls? NAAAAAAAAAH!Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and the rest of the bunch are back for FF 6, including Dominic's ex g/f Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) back from the dead (don't you love how they do that in movies?). The plot has something to do with preventing some international bad guys from getting the final piece to some dreaded weapons system, and...oh who cares? What's great about FF 6 is, like it's last couple of predecessors, it doesn't take itself too seriously..at least not too often..or get too distracted with silly things like a story. There are a few obligatory moments of feigned drama, but it's once you get past those and get to the racing that the movie really gets fun (there's one bad-ass racing sequence in particular, through the streets of London). Racing, shootouts, cool cars and hot babes bending over..what else do you need?Stay tuned for FF 7.",8,1,2,17 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Worst of all the Star Wars Movies
","Attack of the Clones hit the theaters a week after the first Spiderman movie did. It was after watching the two movies one after the other that it hit me as to why I didn't like the Star Wars movies anymore (and why I loved the first two in particular so much). Spiderman had good dialog, a compelling story, and interesting characters who I cared about. Conversely, in Clones I didn't give a damn what happened to anyone in it. In all three 'prequel' movies we see George Lucas' journey into special effects and cartoon character/CGI excess, but it's on display the most here..or maybe it's just that the dialog and characters are so weak that it just seems like it (Sith takes the prize for the most bells and whistles effects-wise). I realized that without fun, likable good guys and interesting bad guys to root for and against, all the effects and shoot 'em ups are pretty boring. Make that REALLY boring. And then Lucas tries to do a love story on top of that and proceeds to butcher it (I remember when he used to be able to direct..think the first Star Wars and American Graffiti). You should be able to do something with a doomed love affair to make it interesting, and Lucas does everything he can to suck the life out of it. Anakin Skywalker and Padme are so boring (and in the case of Anakin, irritating) that you wonder how they could possibly be Luke and Leia's real parents (switched at birth perhaps?) I also fault the performances, and Hayden Christenson's portrayal of Anakin in particular, but in his defense he had nothing to work with script-wise. The only remotely interesting character is Christopher Lee's too-little-seen Count Dooku. Otherwise, it's Lucas and his world of CGI cartoon characters and video-game action sequences. And Ewan McGregor is NO Alec Guinness.",5,1,3,28 December 2012
Spider-Man," Greatest Super Hero Movie Ever
","Spiderman took me back to when I was 11, when I read the Spidey comics. More than any other comic-based movie, this is the comic book come to life, and it's better than any super hero movie I've seen before or since.I know, I know, a lot of Dark Knight enthusiasts will poo-poo this assessment. Fine (I'd rank The Dark Knight at #2). The thing is, I like movies that balance the serious stuff with a sense of humor (the Spidey comics did this), which is where the Dark Knight franchise falls short. For example, the man-on-the-street stuff leading up to Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's initial rant had me absolutely rolling. The ill-tempered and insufferable Jameson was done to a T by J K Simmons ('We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of THIS weirdo!'). He actually did the comic book character one better; his performance definitely was the straw that stirred the drink mid-film. This is a good thing, as Spidey isn't quite the wise-ass in the movie that he is in the comic (my only complaint, and it's minor).That said, Tobey McGuire does a fine job of balancing Peter Parker, the nerdy science whiz kid, with his genetically-mutated Spiderman alter-ego, creating a bona-fide hero that the audience can root for. It seems every super hero has something that drives them to be a crusader for justice, and in Parker's case it was the guilt over failing to use his new spider powers to stop a thief who would go on to murder his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson in one of his many reliably good performances), who was also his only real father figure. As Parker's love interest Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst is sweet and likable, with just the right amount of sex appeal tossed in. James Franco is good as Parker's spoiled best buddy Harry Osbourne. This leads us to..wait for it..Willem Dafoe, whose portrayal of Harry's father Norman, the arrogant scientist and CEO of Oscorp who puts his own personal ambition ahead of safety for himself and his test subjects, leading to his transformation (via ingesting/inhaling an experimental 'performance enhancing' drug) into the thoroughly evil, wildly insane and megalomaniacal Green Goblin, is frighteningly convincing, so much so that you can easily look past the cheesy exo- skeleton outfit he wears. Again, I felt like I was seeing the comic book come to life.As for the effects/action sequences, I know, they've been panned by some (notably Roger Ebert), but they looked good to me. I actually liked the fact that they weren't overdone. Ebert in particular criticized the CGI in this movie, but to me, ALL CGI looks phony and cartoonish. I thought the effects looked just fine as CGI goes, and the action sequences were first rate. One scene in particular where Spiderman is hanging by his web while holding onto a train car full of kids, and at the same time trying to save Mary Jane, is exceptionally gripping. It all leads up to a nice payoff at the end, with the final confrontation between Spidey and the Goblin.The fact that this movie came out within a week of the disappointing Attack of the Clones served as a reminder to this former fan of the Star Wars franchise exactly why I like these kinds of movies. It's not about the special effects; it's the people and the story (pity George Lucas forgot about that. Unfortunately so had Sam Raimi by the time he made Spidey 3). What makes Spiderman such a great movie comes down to a good story (lifted from the comic but adjusted to fit the times), along with fun, likable characters you can root for, compelling villains to root against, and good peripheral characters to stir things up (aside from Simmons, Bruce Campbell makes the most of his screen time as a wrestling ring announcer (Ann: what's your name kid? Parker: The Human Spider. Ann: The Human Spider, that's it? That's the best you've got? Parker: Yeah. Ann: Aaaahh, that sucks!) See this again, and don't bother with the reboot.",10,3,4,13 January 2013
Batman Begins," Batman Reboot Scores Big Time
","We all know that the reason that movie studios sanction reboots and sequels upon sequels is to make as much money off of a franchise as possible. But the question regarding reboots is does this movie improve on the previous ones? Are there technological advances worth exploring? Is there a new angle or wrinkle to the story that's worth telling? In other words, is there a LEGITIMATE reason to make this movie at all? After seeing Batman Begins, my answer is a definite YES.In spite of the departure from the original story (among other changes Batman was never a Ninja in the original comics, and he invented all his gadgets himself), this edition of Batman is far superior to any of its predecessors, including the first Tim Burton Batman (which up until this one had been my favorite by far). The reasons start with the actors, and boy are there some good ones here, playing interesting and compelling characters I cared about. There's Christian Bale, who is the best Bruce Wayne/Batman ever to grace the big screen. Bale's version is definitely more overtly angry and obsessed than in previous Batman films, but at the same time is truly heroic. Michael Caine performs with his usual understated brilliance as Alfred, the loyal servant who essentially raised Bruce after his parents were murdered. Liam Neeson, one of the finest actors of his generation, turns in another stellar performance, this time as (spoiler alert) main villain Ducard aka Ra's Al Ghul. Morgan Freeman turns in a terrific performance as Lucius Fox, the inventor at Wayne Enterprises behind most of Batman's cool toys (Fox is such a strong character I can live with the change from the original story). Cillian Murphy is creepy as the other main villain, Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow, who uses a weaponized panic- inducing drug to drive his enemies insane. Katie Holmes does as well as she can with the one really annoying character in this movie, Bruce's childhood friend/love interest Rachel Dawes (the fact that Katie is such a cutie doesn't hurt). Gary Oldman, another actor's actor, is flawless as Sgt (and future commissioner) Jim Gordon, one good cop in a sea of corrupt ones.Speaking of corrupt, this version of Gotham City is like 1930 Chicago, a sewer of a city run essentially by a crime boss named Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), with everyone from police to judges and city officials on his payroll. Bruce, obsessed with the murder of his parents and driven to be a crusader against evil, has gone to the far east to learn about the criminal underworld and work on his fighting skills. It is there that he meets Ducard, who convinces Bruce to train to be a Ninja with the League of Shadows. Problem is, Bruce comes to find out that the League plans to deal with the crime ridden Gotham City by destroying it. Bruce escapes and burns their compound down, subsequently heading home to rid Gotham of crime his way. Little does he know that the League has already been busy prepping for Gotham's destruction, using Falcone to sneak in the panic inducing drug used by Crane, surreptitiously adding it to Gotham's water supply.The effects and gadgets in this movie are amazing. OK, it took me a while to get used to this version of the batmobile, which is called a 'tumbler' and looks like a tank (appearance-wise nothing could look cooler than the batmobile in Burton's two movies). Notwithstanding, the tumbler is loaded with all kinds of cool tricks, not the least of which is its ability to scale buildings and hop from rooftop to rooftop (Gordon, upon seeing it for the first time: Oh, I've GOTTA get me one of those!).Christopher Nolan really pulled out all the stops in making Batman Begins a reboot truly worth seeing. The acting is superior, the characters are interesting and draw you in, the story is taut and imaginative, and the effects are nothing short of superb. This Batman is much more dark and grim even than Tim Burton's movies (which seem like black comedies by comparison), but it keeps you riveted from start to finish.",9,0,2,9 July 2013
The Dark Knight," Very Dark and Grim..but Never Dull
","I have a tough time with this flick because it is so dark and depressing in places it almost undermines the action, which is the best of any comic book movie to date. I think part of the problem..and I put the blame partially on critics for this..is the demand for something 'more' than a comic book adventure. Hate to break it to you snobs, but no matter how much drama, conflict, and misery you put into a comic book adventure, that's still what it is. To try and make it something else kind of defeats the purpose.That said, The Dark Knight is one awesome tour-de-force, with some of the finest action sequences ever shot (even the CGI looks good..and I HATE CGI). Add to that a very good story and compelling characters, and what you get is one helluva ride. Christian Bale picks up right where he left off with Batman Begins, as the finest Bruce Wayne/Batman ever to grace the big screen. In this movie, Batman's whole belief system gets tested to its limits..and beyond..by Heath Ledger's Joker (WHAT a performance), who takes evil to a whole new level. This Joker is the very definition of a monster; a complete psycho who kills and maims not for money, or vengeance, or a cause. He does it purely for kicks. The only thing he's out to prove is that other people can be just as evil as he is if you just push the right buttons, which he's more than happy to do. He does this by creating scenarios which result in moral dilemmas for Batman and the rest of the 'good' people of Gotham City (i.e...two people are about to die, and I'm only giving you time to save one of them..which will you choose?). To quote Alfred, he just wants to watch the world burn. Speaking of Alfred, chalk up another great performance from Michael Caine, who provides most of the very few moments of levity in this movie. Morgan Freeman is also outstanding as Lucius Fox, the guy who creates most of Batman's toys. Fox also finds himself with a moral dilemma when Batman uses one of his innovations to turn every cell phone in Gotham into a listening device. Maggie Gyllenhaal does as well as she can with the one really annoying character in this particular Batman series, Rachel Dawes (I was able to tolerate Rachel when Katie Holmes played her in the last movie because Katie was so damned cute). Gary Oldman (another true actor's actor) turns in one of his usual flawless performances as Gordon, one good cop in a cesspool of corrupt ones. And then there's Aaron Eckhart as the doomed Harvey Dent, crusading DA-turned-disfigured homicidal maniac Two-Face. His performance is heartbreaking; even with all the horrible things Two-Face does, we still feel bad for him, even as we watch him turn into the very thing he waged war against. Unlike the silly Jones/Schumacher version in Batman Forever, Eckhart and Nolan got Two-Face right. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of him. As for the story itself, it's complex enough to be interesting but not so much that you can't follow it (as opposed to, say, Vanilla Sky). The Dark Knight is a harrowing 2 hours and 32 minutes, without a dull moment. That's an achievement. The acting, characters, and story are all top notch. So are the effects and the sets. The seedy, dark backdrop of Gotham City (this version done in Chicago) is perfect. Painstaking attention to detail was paid to every aspect of this movie, and it shows. Like said backdrop, this movie is grim, depressing, and violent (not for younger kids). Personally, I prefer a bit more levity in movies derived from comic books. Maybe I'm not being fair. Given the nature of this story, there really isn't much room for that. Whereas Tim Burton made Batman almost a black comedy (as he tends to do with a lot of his flicks) and Joel Schumacher's versions were silly and over the top, Christopher Nolan went in completely the opposite direction..maybe too far..into comic film noir. But I'll still take it. Nolan gets a lot more things right about Batman than his predecessors did (Two-Face is the most obvious example). The Dark Knight may not be a happy movie, but it is a great movie..almost as great as the first Spider-man.",9,0,3,2 February 2013
Die Hard," Greatest Cop Action Movie Ever
","Die Hard is a non stop thrill ride from beginning to end. That's not what makes this movie so special though. It's the story, the acting and the characters. NYPD Officer John McClane (played to hard boiled perfection by Bruce Willis) is the walking definition of a hero: a regular guy who gets thrown into a dire situation and reacts well to it. McClane has flown to LA to see his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) for Christmas, and meets her at the building where she works, at her company's Christmas party. They waste no time in getting into yet another spat, when suddenly a group of terrorists seizes the building..and everyone on the 30th floor. At least it seems like terrorists at first (we find out that these 'terrorists' in fact have something else in mind). McClane slips away unnoticed by the supposed terrorists, with his gun (if not his shoes..and yes, he regrets that one later), and proceeds to wreak havoc on the terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in a performance that's nothing short of superb), and his right arm Karl, played by a really angry-looking Alexander Godunov. When McClane isn't taking the bad guys out one at a time, wriggling around in air vents and the elevator shaft, he has to deal with an idiotic deputy police chief (a classic illustration of the Peter principle), a couple of equally clueless FBI agents, and a conniving co worker of Holly's who tries to turn McClane into Gruber by telling him who he really is (up to that point Gruber didn't know his name). There's also an ambitious dirt bag of a TV news reporter played by William Atherton, who ends up giving Holly's identity out over the air.Die Hard is a rarity among action flicks in that the action is actually plausible (unlike the various sequels). The characters are believable too (yes, even that moron of a deputy police chief)..and interesting. This more than keeps things going during the short breaks in the action. All this makes Die Hard the best movie of its genre ever made.",10,1,1,7 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Merciless End to the First Trilogy
","I recently watched Sith on Spike TV after having not seen it for a while. Right after that they showed the first Star Wars (or to Star Wars geeks, Episode 4, A New Hope). There was absolutely no comparison between the two movies..the original Star Wars was that much better. There are a number of reasons, but it boils down to this. In Star Wars and Empire, the effects supported the story and the characters. In the three 'prequels,' and in particular this movie and Clones, the characters and story are more of an afterthought to support the massive amounts of CGI/effects and cartoon characters invented by George Lucas.In Sith, the episode which is supposed to be the lead-in for the original Star Wars movie, all the pieces seem to be there for a compelling space opera..tons of effects, all kinds of weird space alien characters, lots of action sequences, and it does tie together the first trilogy of 'prequels.' Yet it doesn't work, at least not for me. The primary reason is that, like in Clones, I couldn't care less about the main characters, especially the now thoroughly annoying Anakin Skywalker. It gets so you WANT him to freaking go over to the dark side and get it over with so we don't have to listen to his incessant whining anymore. Anakan is such a sniveling obnoxious little punk you just want to reach through the screen and smack him. And when he does ultimately turn into Darth Vader, he lacks the one element so essential to Vader's character: Menace (amazing given how many people he kills..including a bunch of kids training to be Jedi). As Vader he continues to behave like a petulant, obnoxious kid who got sent to bed without his dinner. Much of the blame has to go squarely on the shoulders of Hayden Christenson. Yes, the lines he had to read were awful, but his rancid performance made it far worse.Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan is bland (unfortunately, he couldn't do what Alec Guinness could do with boring dialog). Ditto Natalie Portman as Padme. Just one example: She and Christenson take the scene where Padme confronts Anakin about the evil he's done, which should be powerful and poignant, and manage to make it boring. That took some doing. As I stated in my review of Clones, it's hard to believe that Luke and Leia's parents could be such dullards. OK, as far as Yoda goes, I have to admit that unlike other Star Wars fans, I never did like the sanctimonious little muppet-turned-CGI image, but unfortunately he's one of the few semi-interesting characters in this movie. Also, Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine/Darth Sidious is evil enough, but he doesn't come off as scary so much as like a little a-hole you just want to punch. There were other problems. Too many elements going on at once, and too many characters (General Grievous in particular was not only lame but unnecessary). One thing that really bugs me is how it is that Yoda and Mace Windu, for all of their knowledge of the force, don't see ANY of this coming. They don't even SUSPECT what Palpatine is up to until it's too late (they should have been immediately suspicious when he got 'emergency powers' in the previous flick). And how exactly is it that Yoda and Obi Wan 'lost?' OK, they had to lose to lead into the next movie, but come on. All Obi Wan had to do to Anakin-turned-Vader was KILL HIM. His legs are gone, his body is burning...JUST TAKE YOUR LIGHT SABER AND CUT OFF HIS FREAKING HEAD ALREADY!!!! Yeah yeah, I know, he can't bring himself to kill his former apprentice and buddy, but he can watch him burn instead of mercifully ending it all? Against the emperor, Yoda just kind of gives up. He gets knocked down and falls for a long way, but is far from dead or beaten, yet comes to conclusion that he has 'failed.' OK, so everything's on the line and you just throw in the towel and wait for Skywalker's two kids to come along and fix everything 20 years later? Nope, I'd say not much thought was put into the actual plot.What's sad about this and the other Star Wars 'prequels' is that they could have been REALLY good..like the first two Star Wars flicks were. But they had actors that couldn't act, scripts with dialog that went beyond insipid and a creator/director who was so caught up in his CGI and cartoon characters that he lost sight of what made his first two movies so special. Lucas once said that a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing. Time to listen to your own advice George. I give Sith 5 out of 10 for the effects and action sequences. If they rerun it on TV go ahead and watch, but don't waste your money on the DVD or Blu Ray.",5,3,6,31 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Weakest Movie of the Nolan Batman Trifecta is Still Good
","One of the strongest points about The Dark Knight was that it had a plot that was complex enough to be interesting, but not so much that you couldn't follow the story. The Dark Knight Rises pushes that boundary to its limits. Eventually things do come together, but it does require some heavy lifting to keep track of everything that's going on..and there's a lot going on.Eight years have passed since the events of The Dark Knight, and Bruce Wayne has gone into self-imposed exile. The various injuries he's accumulated while chasing bad guys in his bat suit have caught up with him, and we find that he's blown most of his fortune. Early on, a petty thief named Selina (they don't call her 'Catwoman' by name) robs Bruce's safe. It turns out that she wasn't after the contents; She was hired to get something else that would be later used against Bruce. In spite of the inauspicious beginning, a weird romantic connection develops between the two. But never mind the complexities of the Bruce/Selina relationship. The real bad guy here is Bane.And Bane (Tom Hardy) really is one bad dude, the most physically imposing villain Batman has ever faced. He demonstrates this by breaking Batman's back in the first part of the movie, then sending the unmasked Bruce Wayne to a sort of prison pit in some unknown foreign country, while he proceeds to all but destroy Gotham City and put certain residents 'on trial' (the 'judge' being Dr. Jonathan Crane aka Scarecrow). To make matters worse, Bane has found Batman's stash of toys (including three 'tumbler' batmobiles), and he and his followers use them in wreaking havoc on Gotham. Part of what Bane is apparently attempting to do is expose Gotham's hypocrisy, specifically the secret that Batman and Commissioner Gordon kept in the wake of Harvey Dent's death, leading to a series of new anti-crime laws. He even refers to himself as 'Gotham's reckoning.' There's also another villain who is revealed late in the movie, who's really the one behind all the mayhem.Some problems I have with this movie include the fact that Bane is an awful lot like a certain other movie villain with a mask (can you say Darth Vader?), with one exception: Bane's mask muffles half the stuff he says. Between that and the complexities of the story, this movie is really hard to follow in places. There are also some not-so-subtle references to the Occupy Wall Street movement made by Selina/Catwoman in particular, who uses the 'haves and have-nots' argument to justify her criminal activities. I didn't like what they did with Catwoman in this. Catwoman has always oozed sexuality above all else, and you don't get that here. Part of it is the drab costume, but part of it is Anne Hathaway. She's pretty enough, but doesn't exactly have the sex appeal of, say Scarlet Johanssen as Black Widow in the Avengers. You actually don't see a lot of Batman in this movie..or at least not in his bat suit. What you do see a lot of is Bruce Wayne, who spends the majority of his screen time beaten and broken.On the plus side, the effects and action sequences are superb (par for the course for Christopher Nolan). The scene where a football field is destroyed in the middle of the game is mind blowing. I don't generally like CGI, but Nolan uses it very effectively here. I also liked the way the movie ended, which left a good taste in my mouth, so to speak. Batman ultimately does save the day, and the surprise ending actually is a happier one than the Dark Knight, and neatly wraps up the third installment of the Nolan batman trilogy. 7.5",7,3,6,10 April 2013
Blade Runner," More Human Than Human..
","..so says the motto of the Tyrell Corporation, which builds humanoid robots, called 'replicants' to do manual labor on off world colonies. The latter part is key, as replicants have been forbidden on earth, and any replicant who defies the order is to be hunted down and 'retired' (read: killed) by special police called blade runners (replicants are supposed to be retired in 4 years regardless). Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner presents a bleak dystopian future. The very first thing you see after the opening credits are these giant smokestacks belching black clouds and fiery bursts into the air, then high rise buildings which dwarf anything that's been built today, with full picture/video ads playing on the sides of the buildings, plus flying cars called spinners. This contrasts with the poverty and despair which you find below (shades of the old sci fi movie 'Metropolis'). The main character is Rick Deckard, a blade runner, played by Harrison Ford. He's up against a group of rebel replicants led by Roy Battie (Rutger Hauer) who have come back to Earth. They want to be human like everyone else, and are willing to die (or kill) trying. There's another interesting twist to the story, which is hinted at more strongly in the director's cut than in the original: Is Deckard himself a replicant?The concept was very good (taken from a story by Philip K. Dick, who's had more than one of his stories made into movies posthumously). Human robots who simply want to be human. The idea of humans killing and enslaving each other is not new; it's been going on throughout history. But in this case, humans have elevated themselves to the level of playing God by creating artificial life, with emotions and false memories of childhood, then subsequently extinguishing that life when it is no longer considered beneficial to the general populous, or if said life rebels. Again, nothing new. The eugenicist movement of the turn of the last century, which gave us the likes of Hitler, Stalin and Mao, believed this stuff too.Given everything this movie has going for it, I should love it. Alas...it moved at an absolute snails pace, and the character development just wasn't there. I just didn't care that much about what happened to the characters in the story, and given the story and subject matter involved I SHOULD care..deeply. The mere fact that Ridley Scott re-cut this movie three times tells you all you need to know there. Unfortunately, re-cutting Blade Runner is like trying to give an ugly building a fresh coat of paint...it's still ugly. Ironically, what this movie has going for it in spades are the visuals of the futuristic Los Angeles; they're nothing short of stunning, and this was long before the advent of CGI.Blade Runner could have been great. It SHOULD have been great. It's disappointing to see such a great idea for a movie fall short.",6,1,3,28 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," No Ewoks, No Jar Jar, No Kidding
","Note: Even though I checked 'might contain spoilers,' for the benefit of those who haven't seen this yet (which was me until today), I'm going to try not to give too much away here.Wow..after 38 long years, they finally got it right. Yes, I know I'm in the minority in that I liked the first Star Wars better than Empire, and to be fair, Empire was also a very good movie. But since then, Star Wars movies had lost their way..introducing those gawd awful little fuzzy muppets in Jedi, and those even worse CGI/cartoon characters in the 'prequels'(i.e. Jar Jar Binks, the single worst character in Star Wars history). George Lucas had forgotten (or maybe never really understood) what made the first two Star Wars movies so good. This was painfully evident in the three 'prequels,' where the story, dialogue, and characters took a backseat to all those dazzling effects and CGI coming out of Skywalker Ranch. In a recent interview Lucas revealed that he saw the Star Wars saga as a soap opera..which sums up nicely why I didn't like the last 3 Star Wars flicks in particular (didn't much care for Jedi either). Behind all those neat special effects, that's exactly what those movies were: Episodes of a bad soap opera, with bad writing and bad acting. Thankfully, JJ Abrams captured..masterfully..what was great about Star Wars in the first place (I was actually concerned about what Abrams would do with Star Wars, since I did NOT like what he did with Star Trek, but boy, does he get it right here).The Force Awakens not only brings back the familiar characters we already liked (Harrison Ford does an especially good job as the older Han Solo), but the new characters are likable too. The story is the best since the early days as well. I think it's supposed to be set 30 odd years after Jedi. You get glimpses of what has happened since, but you don't get everything..I have a feeling there will be more bits and pieces revealed in the next two installments. But the dark side has re-emerged..personified by the character of the evil..yet conflicted..Kylo Ren (in a terrific performance by Adam Driver..Hayden Christenson should take some notes). The Empire has been replaced by the evil 'First Order,' and standing in their way is the 'Resistance.' The First Order has an ultimate weapon even more horrifying than the original Death Star, and they ain't afraid to use it. The young character on the 'light' side of the force is Rey, played well by Daisy Ridley. By the end, she's still a bit of a mystery..you're left wondering exactly how she figures into all this. Again, I think we'll get the answers in subsequent movies.What I loved about the original Star Wars movie was that it was the quintessential illustration of what I believe movies should be..a 2+ hour escape from reality. This latest edition of Star Wars also epitomizes this. Yes, there are a few small plot continuity inconsistencies from the previous flicks. Do yourself a favor and don't worry about them. Just sit back and enjoy.I'm glad it's back. :-)",9,8,22,28 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Simply The Greatest Movie Ever Made
","It's been over 35 years since I first saw this unbelievable piece of cinema. And the weird thing is that I was a little disappointed that first time. Star Wars had been SO hyped that by the time I saw it back in 1977 I was expecting a non stop shoot 'em up from start to finish. The fact that the movie came out of the gate so quickly when Darth Vader and his storm troopers attacked and boarded Princess Leia's starship only increased those expectations. So naturally the following scenes in the desert on Tattooine right after that intense opening were a bit of a letdown. The desert sequence seemed to go on FOREVER, even though it really doesn't last that long. It wasn't until the 2nd time I saw Star Wars that it really hit me just how great this movie was. I think the trick was that I wasn't watching it with expectations or a critical eye the 2nd time..I just sat back and enjoyed it. A friend at the time criticized it for not being good science fiction, but he had it all wrong. Star Wars isn't a science fiction movie per se, though there are some terrific sci fi elements in it. At its heart, Star Wars is a fairy tale..maybe the greatest ever told.I guess I'll give my 'critics analysis,' such as it is, as to why this movie is so great. It's not the effects, or the action, or the sets, even though all of the above are spectacular. It's the story, the dialog, and most of all those memorable characters who immediately draw you in. Mark Hamill is terrific as the eager young Luke Skywalker, who at this point in his life just wants to quit being a farmer and have some adventure. Carrie Fisher is equally good as the sharp-tongued Princess Leia. Fisher makes the most of some good lines ('Would somebody get this big, walking CARPET out of my way?!'). Harrison Ford is spot on as the cynical, wise-cracking, swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (my favorite character in Star Wars). Not much to say about Obi-Wan Kenobi, other than the fact that he's played by the incomparable Alec Guinness, an actor's actor for whom a bad performance is a contradiction. Guinness could make the most basic line of dialog sound interesting. And oh, those robots. The back and forth between C3PO and R2D2 is beyond priceless. And of course, there's the bad guy to end all bad guys, Darth Vader. But as mean and heartless as Vader is, he's also, in a weird way, cool. The scene on the Death Star where Vader nearly chokes a pompous ass of a general to death (the first time we witness his telekinetic powers) is classic. You can see that Vader does not suffer fools well, even (or especially) when they're on his side. The action sequences, though very well done, are not overdone. George Lucas does a wonderful job of taking the concept of the dogfight and transposing it to outer space. Ditto the sword fighting scenes, substituting foils with light sabers..truly inspired. The same is true for the visual effects. They're wonderful, but they support the story and characters rather than upstage them, and although there are a lot of neat visuals, somehow you don't feel bombarded by them (unlike subsequent Star Wars movies, alas..). Again, having a strong story with compelling characters helps. The sets are terrific too (the Millennium Falcon is my favorite). One thing I like about Lucas' universe in Star Wars (as opposed to Gene Roddenberry's in Star Trek) is that not everything is pristine and perfect. Machines and equipment from the Falcon to the droids look well used. The scene that best personifies Lucas' universe is in the bar. It's like something right out of the old west..only with space aliens. You also get a bit of mysticism and sword and sorcery (as in the Force) to go with the sci fi..which will be expanded on in future films. A buddy of mine once said that Star Wars was the first movie that was EVERYTHING that a sci-fi action adventure could be. George Lucas called it his gift to a generation which grew up without fairy tales. I just call it fun; the greatest tour-de-force in motion picture history. Yes, there are movies which are far more serious, which examine human imperfections, harp on social issues, etc., but when I go to the movies, I want to forget about the world's troubles for a couple of hours, not be reminded of them. And Star Wars is the definition of escapist fair. The first one in its original cut is the best. The 90s re-release with added scenes and enhanced effects, though still good, was not necessary, and Lucas flat out ruined one of the classic scenes in the original movie: the scene in the bar featuring Solo and Greedo.",10,0,0,1 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars Gets Dark
","I'll admit to not being one of the 'cool' people (as in cool nerds) who like this installment of Star Wars better than the first because it's darker and takes itself more seriously. Escapist movies such as Star Wars and Raiders shouldn't take themselves too seriously, and it hurts Empire a bit..but just a bit. This is still a fun ride. That said, it does take Empire a lot longer to get out of the gate than the the first one did. After a long slow buildup, there's that great battle scene on the ice planet Hoth (where we first see the Imperial walkers). After getting driven from Hoth, two stories emerge: While Han Solo, Princess Leia, C3PO and Chewbacca are hiding from Darth Vader in an asteroid field, Luke Skywalker(with R2D2) is off on this rat hole of a planet in the Degaba system to learn about the Force (he gets a vision from Obi Wan early in the movie telling him to go there). This brings us to a character beloved by a majority of Star Wars fans yet reviled by me. I'm of course talking about the sanctimonious muppet (later CGI image) Yoda. Despite the fact that I found his character so annoying, the detail with regard to Yoda's facial expressions (his eyes in particular) was amazing back in a time long before CGI. Luke starts to learn about the Force (in what must be a crash course when you compare it to the 'prequels'), but leaves when he sees visions of his friends in trouble, and despite Yoda's admonishments, goes to help them. This is where Luke starts getting irritating. He knows Vader is setting a trap for him, yet lets his emotions totally get the best of him and goes anyway. Makes you wonder if you want to leave the future of the galaxy in the hands of someone this flaky.Luke isn't quite as much fun as he was in the first one, but the other characters make up for it. The back and forth between Han and Leia is even funnier than in the previous movie. In fact, this movie is Solo's finest hour (good thing, because the subsequent carbon freeze he went through apparently softened his brain). If you wanted to take the essence of everything I love about Solo and bottle it, it would come down to two words: I know. Speaking of which, the love story between Han and Leia (which culminated in those two words) was handled just right..the movie didn't dwell on it, though the sexual tension was evident in the way the two of them sniped at each other early on.Darth Vader was his bad self..even more in this movie than the first one (and even less patient with fools, as a couple of imperial officers found out the hard way). The fight between Luke and Vader in the 2nd half was where the movie started to degenerate into taking itself too seriously. Star Wars doesn't do as well when it gets too dramatic. The visuals are great though.Rounding out rest of the characters, Billy Dee Williams is fine as Han's old pirate buddy Lando, though his character and Solo's were pretty similar. Then there was the single most over-hyped character in Star Wars, Boba Fett (I think he had all of two lines). C3PO and R2D2 were great, but they were separated for much of this movie..they work better together. Chewbacca's best moment was early in the movie when he was laughing at Solo after Leia insulted him..It bugged me for a long time that this movie didn't really end..that it left you hanging for three years until the next one came out (as in leaving Han Solo in carbon freeze). I finally got past that, realizing that in a sense it does 'end'..our heroes live to fight another day, but only after taking a serious beating for most of the movie. Though I didn't like it as much as the first, Empire was still a worthy effort. 8.5",8,0,0,5 February 2013
The Ugly Truth," Not Bad but Could Have Been Better
","I'll admit that part of the reason I have a soft spot for this movie is that it's set in my hometown of sorts, Sacramento, and it involves the broadcast industry (I say 'of sorts,' because although I never lived in Sactown, I worked there for years..in the broadcast industry). There are some really good shots of the downtown area in particular (Director Robert Luketic obviously likes to open his movies with relatively low view-from-the-sky city shots..'21' opened in similar fashion in Boston).The movie's principals are Abby (Katherine Heigl), a producer for a local morning news show who's also an anal retentive control freak with no sense of humor. She's under pressure from her boss because the show is tanking in the ratings. Contrast that with Mike (Gerard Butler), a foul-mouthed misogynist with his own cable access show called 'The Ugly Truth,' where he discusses 'relationships.' Abby runs across the show by accident after coming home alone from an unsuccessful date (which seems to be a common occurrence with her), and proceeds to call Mike during the show when she takes exception to some of his remarks (among other things he tells women who want a relationship to get on a stair master and get some trashy lingerie). Mike proceeds to skewer her on the air. The next morning, she gets a surprise: Her boss has hired Mike and is incorporating 'The Ugly Truth' into the show, which up until that point has been a milquetoast local version of Regis and Kathie Lee, featuring a husband and wife team who put on a facade of wedded bliss but in reality can't stand each other (he's a moron and a wimp, she's an angry, shrill-voiced harpy). The first thing Mike does on the show is expose this for everyone to see. Needless to say, Abby is furious, and is still unhappy even when ratings improve.Abby then discovers that she has a neighbor who has all the qualities she's looking for in a man (she's so anal she actually keeps a checklist of said qualities). Mike makes her a deal. He'll help her get the guy if she'll get off Mike's back, and if she can't land Mr. Perfect, Mike promises to quit. This is where the movie starts to degenerate into the predictable rom-com M.O.(boy and girl meet, hate each other at first but ultimately end up together). Of course, 'Mr. Perfect' isn't really the right guy, and you know who's she's going to end up with.That said, there are enough laugh-out-loud moments in this movie to make it relatively enjoyable as 'chick flicks' go, even for the guys. Gerard Butler is especially entertaining in this, but what makes Mike's misogynistic rants even funnier is when they're played off of Abby's 'what's so funny, I don't find anything funny!' attitude. This movie is raunchy..definitely deserving of its R rating. Some parts I found hilarious; others made me cringe. In spite of this, and in spite of the fact that it falls into the standard rom-com formula, there are enough genuinely funny moments in The Ugly Truth to keep you entertained.",6,0,1,30 April 2013
High Fidelity," A Comedy for Adults
","John Cusack has made a career out of playing offbeat, off-center characters. High Fidelity could well be his finest hour. The movie centers on the trials and tribulations of the love life of Rob Gordon. Rob runs a used record store (as in, they sell vinyl), and he likes to put not just music, but various aspects of his life in the context of 'top 5' lists.When the story starts, we see Laura, Rob's most recent girlfriend, leave him, prompting him to come up with, 'My desert island, all-time, top- five most memorable breakups, in chronological order, are as follows...(various names) Can you see your name on that list, Laura? Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten. But there's just no room for you in the top five, sorry! Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliation and heartbreak you're just not capable of delivering.' Rob then proceeds to give a recap of his various misadventures in love, starting with his first breakup in grade school. He also talks extensively about the highs and lows of his relationship with Laura. Of course, we find out that Laura's departure has gotten to Rob a lot more than he initially admits. Rob talks to the camera throughout this movie, much in the same way he might talk to his therapist about his life, his loves, his friends and his hopes and dreams.In between flashbacks, we meet some of the quirky people in Rob's life, most notably Barry and Dick (played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso), the two cultural rejects who work for him at the record store. Along with Rob, they like to fancy themselves as pop music aficionados and look down on the musically undiscriminating masses (Barry is especially annoying in this regard, even refusing to sell a record to a potential customer and treating him like garbage simply because, 'he offended me with his terrible taste!').Cusack is great at playing characters who are borderline insane, and this movie is definitely no exception. One passage pretty much sums up this flick: After Charlie, #3 on his list (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) dumps him, Rob essentially goes nuts and rants on the street outside her window, 'Charlie! You f#%ing b!tch!! Let's work it out!!' Then there's the scene where Rob fantasizes about pounding the stuffing out of the condescending and pretentious Ray (aka Ian), 'the other guy' Laura's been seeing (played by Tim Robbins).High Fidelity is a terrific story about life and love with intelligent, clever, thoughtful dialog and memorable, quirky characters that draw you right in. It's far too innovative and non-formulaic to be classified as your basic rom com, but it's definitely a good one to see with a date.",10,1,2,12 February 2013
