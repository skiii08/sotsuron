The Blair Witch Project," Utterly unfrightening amateur crap...
","This movie should be retitled in the name of Psychology. I suggest a name change from 'The Blair Witch Project' to 'The Effects of What a pseudo-Documentary of Three Bickering, Swearing, Sleep, Food and Cigarette Deprived American 20-Somethings With Over-Active Imaginations Due to Emotional Instability the lack of the afore mentioned] Can Have have not!] on a typical American audience.' Doubtlessly that title would be a burden for cinema-listings, but seriously! This movie seemed over-long, yet it couldn't have been more than a little over an hour long. I couldn't help yawning. Maybe I'm not impressionable enough, maybe I've seen too many cheap-thrill type shockers to get the subtlies... maybe the home-films shot by my parents of my siblings and I frolicking in our garden are more inspired. Lets face it, this 'film' just defies any logical explanation of a plot, a purpose or a reason. Furthermore, it has been way overhyped. The short trailer featuring a snippet of the Heather character's desperate soliloquy to the camera was actually scarier out of context on the t.v. screen. But that's the price you pay for creating false impressions--some are driven home in individuals willing and possessing the trait of being conned by hype; others just end up having their illusions shattered. Just between you and me, I knew deep down I wouldn't be scared, cause that's just not my personality, but I needed to verify it. Perhaps that's the other attraction of such movies... they make us doubt our senses and our convictions. But only temporarily. The moral of this story is that the real scares we have to experience ourselves. I don't believe such badly filmed footage can recreate in the audience any feelings of the terror felt by the actors.",1,2,3,1 November 1999
