It," Best horror movie in a while
","This has to the best horror movie I've seen in a very long time. Being completely honest, it wasn't as scary as I expected but it was WAY better than I expected. Script, story and casting was all perfection. This movie really did the book justice. I am super excited for the next one to come out. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who may be even slightly considering going see it.",10,51,101,17 September 2017
