The Avengers," Iron man all the way....
","It was a spectacular experience watching this movie in 3D. Without the 3D effects it will only be a still those who love epic action movies. Movie starts off with a very slow pace and then it gathers speed since the entry of iron man.This movie has a large number of academy awards nominees. Robert Downey Jr; Gwyneth Paltrow; Samuel L Jackson; Jeremy Renner; Mark Ruffalo etc.It is Robert Downey Jr's movie indeed. He delivered a spectacular performance as a guy who can't help but to tell wits in each and every sentence he says. Th audience loved watching Iron man in action. I was happy with entry of Gwyneth Paltrow as well.Mark Ruffalo managed to stick to his own personal standard as well. He portrays a man who is very caring, soft and tender but later turns out to be someone who is disastrous to the environment, when he gets angry. Scarlett Johanssen shined well in this film. She was very flexible in action as well as acting. Her addition made this movie much more thrilling. She look very cool with curled red hair. It is definitely one of her best looks since Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth too was good.Chris Evans looked a lot different from his earlier films. He managed deliver the maturity his character Captain America needed.The whole film had a lot of visual effects. The 3d effects mad the movie look more attractive. one can definitely go for the film to look for their favorite super hero. Definitely the fans of Iron man will love the film.8/10",8,3,8,27 April 2012
Men in Black 3," Best among the series....
","The men in black series have improved as it goes on. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones returns as the world'd most favorite MIB agents. But now it is more than that. Agent K is not found missing and Agent J finds him dead for over forty years. At the same time he is found to crave chocolate milk and even snatches one from a four year old kid without even saying please. Then with the help acquaintance he goes back to 1969 where agent K is actually supposed to die. How he prevents it and mystery behind forms the rest of the plot.The movie has the suspense element that keeps the audience hooked to the screen till the very end. Plot is bigger and better. Each and every scene has something or the other going. The final fights scenes are a lot better compared to the other men in black films. Movie is a lot funnier too. Will Smith is still the old J that we all know. The person who says funny things when he opens his mouth and all. He is very lively and witty. Everyone will love agent J.Tommy Lee Jones looked very old. He also appeared less impressive compared to superb performance in men in black 1. His character is shown very vulnerable and fragile.Josh Brolin was dashing as young agent K. He was spectacular. He talked and moved just like Tommy Lee Jones. His way of dialog delivery was really like Tommy Lee Jones's duplicate.Others were also good.The 3D effects were lot better in this film compared to many other best (Avengers, Resident evil afterlife, Wrath of the titans) It is indeed very enjoyable and has to be experienced in 3D at least even once. 8/10",8,1,5,26 May 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," I am toooooooo disappointed....
","DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE MOVIE....Once upon a time even i was a die hard twilight saga fan... but not anymore... i am on boys side... with the movie these guys are just throwing away their names...the plot was too weak....the movie ends when Bella opens her eyes as a vampire... the ending was just like avatar.. people were applauding and all but there did come situations when i felt like booing...performances were terrible..Kristen Stewart was as usual... Stereotyped.. shaking her head a lot, overreacting when she was nervous and above keeping her mouth open all the time thinking that it is her million dollar facial expression... (try not to see much movies of hers, she can have a really bad effect on you)Rober Pattinson is becoming worse and worse as the series goes on... he was pretty remarkable in the first movie with controlled expressions and personality... He showed exactly how Edward is in the books... but since the second movie..dunno what happened.. I loved Edward but not the kind of person shown in the succeeding twilight movies... He talked as if he is weightlifting and some parts especially in this movie he failed...The scene Bella gives birth is one of the worst scenes you see..( some felt sad because they liked the characters and movies...) scene were she becomes paralyzed was totally spoiled... we expect good performances. the scene didn't click as it is supposed to. like Jacob crying outside the house and Edward trying to revive her... all those scenes didn't click well.. there Robert's performance was terrible because i saw a similar scene in two other movie where the performances were just incredible... i just could not help comparing this with the other films...so all i could say is that, if you want to give it a shot okay go ahead.. i have decided to part 2 anyway and i am having absolutely no great expectations from it...",1,7,8,16 December 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Best 3D experience ever!!!!!
","I saw avatar, Gulliver's travels, piranha, Chronicles of narnia 4step up 3 and resident evil 4 so far. I never enjoyed the others the way i enjoyed this movie. It was incredible and definitely it won't be the same in 2D. Action scenes were amazing. The knifes come directly towards us. The explosions and everything were really effective.It is also an edge of the seat thriller. I did not like the first or second as they seemed a bit poor comparably. Milla Jovovich was as usual fantastic. Ali Larter and everyone else were good. The music was excellent. It is the kind of movie that you want to watch over and over again. And it should be experienced in 3D.",8,6,14,16 April 2011
Minority Report," Good but could have been better
",I am a big fan of Steven Spielberg. I was looking forward to see this movie. Definitely it was worth it. The movie revolves around a disturbed Chief John Anderton(Tom cruise) who is dealing with his son's loss and wife's separation. He is the member of the precrime who stops the crime from taking place with the help of the precogs who sees the future. The twist of fate occurs when the precogs sees Anderton himself kill a man he has never met. The movie has a solid theme and script. But there were situations where I felt that it could have been a lot better. Including the part where the killer of Anne lively was revealed. Overall the movie has the kind of suspense and it keeps you at the edge of your seat till the movie is over. Tom Cruise was superb as the John Anderton where he is a strong and tough cop on one side and a vulnerable and drug addicted man on the other. Samantha Morton too was good. She looks a lot different in this film. Max Von Sydow too did his part great. Colin Farrell too stuck with his standard. Kathryn Morris looked a lot better when compared to her role Mindhunters. All the fans of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg will love the film. It will definitely keep you at the edge of your seat. But one may have to see this movie more than once in order to fully understand the plot. It is better not to know the plot at all before you see the film. 8/10,8,0,0,25 April 2012
The Hunger Games," Could have been better.
","I liked the hunger games book. It was pretty thrilling and edge of the seat. The characters and the emotions were well depicted. But the movie could have been lot better. I felt as if they started it quickly and ended it just as. But some portions were better than the book though. The reaping scene for example, then the district 11 riot. Jennifer Lawrence delivered an effortless performance for the movie. Josh Hutcherson managed to look different from his usual chocolate boy teenage roles. Woody Harrelson was also in his usual standard. Other than the Rue's farewell score, there was nothing much on the film that makes one remember the hunger games. I wished James Newton Howard could have added something more and better in the movie.The song Abraham's daughter was very haunting and vibrant. Overall the movie was quiet enjoyable and re watchable but it just could have been better. The climax was not up to the mark. 7/10",7,0,2,8 February 2013
Underworld Awakening," Nice movie for a sequel
","I was very thrilled to know that Kate Beckinsale is returning as Selene in the upcoming underworld film. I loved the first two movies and I wondered how the second was going to be all about. Usually such sequel are unnecessary. The stories are just pushed into the series and finally we feel that, hey that was not necessary. It spoiled the thrill of the first film. But not in this case.Vampires in the underworld are hundred times more thrilling than the vampires in twilight saga. Kata Beckinsale returns as the beautiful, slick and stylish vampire gal Selene. But yes she has changed a lot. She looks older, yet she is still the same girl in action. New characters and addictions are nice of course. There is sequel yet to come to complete the sequel of this film, I hope it comes soon. I rather not mention the plot much here. It is any day better to watch the film with absolutely no idea about the theme or the plot. The visual effects are spectacular. One of the best 3D effects in a film. The dark scenes can be a little distraction for such effects. People who does not enjoy movies taken in the dark need not enjoy this. But in general it is worth a look and all the underworld fans will love this film.8/10",8,14,27,26 January 2012
Shutter Island," Leo-Scorsese team rocks again
","I watched Departed before shutter island and was fascinated by Leonardo Dicaprio's acting. Then I saw the trailer of Shutter Island. My dad and I waited for the release of the blu ray of this film. I had been a great fan of Leo's since I saw the movie blood diamond, where i have felt that he was robbed of the Oscars.I haven't seen any other Martin Scorsese's films. After seeing this movie I have declared that he is a great director. He is a genius. Each and every scene was taken artistically and one doesn't get bored.The story has a lot of twists and turns. At the end we'll be like 'Oh my god, how come I didn't see that coming'. So it is better not to investigate anything about this film before seeing (if you haven't seen it).Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is definitely the most notable feature in this film. I wondered why he didn't get the Oscar nomination. even the movie was far better than departed or aviator.Mark Ruffalo also became one of my most favorite actors. Ben Kingsley was in a standard of his own. He was steadfast and flexible. Michelle Williams was good but was overshadowed by Leo. Patricia Clarkson was good even though she was only there for one scene.Music was stupendous. I loved the track on the nature by daylight. then the cinematography was exemplary and there were certain shots i loved.If you love thriller see this. If you are a fan Leonardo Dicaprio, then you MUST see this. 10/10",10,1,3,31 December 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Spectacular...
",It's been quite a while since I saw a film with my friend and I saw Mission Impossible 4 after months of waiting.I wanted since I saw the trailer. And it was worth it. The visual effects and everything was good. I just wished that this movie was 3D. Then it would have rocked. The sand storm scene was the best. The sound effects were stupendous. It was like we were in middle of the Sand storm. And the Burj khalifa scene was also breath taking.Tom Cruise was as usual bright and action loaded as Ethan Hunt. He was steadfast and controlled. His action is one of the best attraction of this film.Paula Patton was also good. Her role as an action heroine and a charming woman was attractive. She was indeed. (I liked her Hindi)Jeremy Renner seemed a bit timid first but turned to be as smart as the others later on.But this movie is definitely also in Simon Pegg's palm. He was just fantastic.Anil kapoor and others also did their part well.this is definitely the best among the mission impossible series. If you are an action movie fan do not miss this.9/10,9,8,13,23 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I am a teenage girl and I HATE this movie.
","I am a teenage girl and I am very proud to say that I hate this movie. I almost feel most teenage girls being hardcore fans of this saga is like having a big black mark on them. It almost sounds like guys are genius and gals are like 'flies off when they see their heroes' in this case Edward and Jacob. Oh for god sake grow up!!!looks are not the only issue here. Performance, script, presentation and above plot line always stands first as Far as a real critic is concerned.I never had the intention to see this film. Let me be honest now... I loved the first film twilight... I can't deny it. The direction was good. the plot was okay but some parts were still missing. As far as the performances were concerned Stewart seemed to have held up with how Bella was in the book. Pattinson was my favorite as he was quite remarkable. He was steadfast and controlled.But after seeing this and eclipse i have decided to take all my opinion back about them. The biggest problem of Kristen was that she is too STEREOTYPED! With her open O mouthed expression, her blinking, shaking of the head, annoying breath, emotionless under toned speech and above all blank face she could top as the world's most stereotyped actress. All those people whose brain works will notice all this.And Pattinson, he was my favorite. When I came to know that he was nominated for Razzies I was depressed. But after seeing this film, I thought, no wonder. He lost his brightness completely. He speaks as if he is trying to lift a heavy object. His acting in the volturi scenes really sucked.Lautner was good. But he had some overacting here and there. He can't do very emotional scenes. Ashley Greene was okay but not spectacular.Now back to the plot. It was very weak and less catchy. you will like only if you are a hard core twilight fan. The presentation could have been better but so far it is just the worst.1/10",1,5,7,19 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Seriously is that how they wanted the series to look like.
","It's been a while since I've bashing the twilight saga. Yes I'm a girl and I'm proud to say that I don't find anything too romantic about this so called worldwide phenomenon. I didn't go to see this in the theater because my god! The last one BDP 1 was sooooo horrible that I almost vomited in my seat. I got the movie just now so I just decided to give a try. It was after Bella became a vampire. She can now everything in close ups, hear Minor sounds and even smell fresh human blood. Her dad found a new person in his life. Things got better with Jacob and his old pal but now the volturi is coming after them because Edward's cousin witnessed Renesmee (not such a bad name to me though, I've heard worse) their half human- half vampire daughter and presumed that she is an immortal child. Rest of the plot deals with the Cullen trying their best to gather as many witnesses as possible and confront the volturi.Yes this is the plot point. Most of you may even ask 'Is that it?' It is a great improvement from new moon, eclipse and definitely BDP 1 because it contains less cheesy dialogs and better plot. I mean better and not great. I know what guys will look forward to, more fighting scenes and deaths. We will all look forward to a movie with better pacing, acting and effects. That is what making a movie all is about.Kristen Stewart is a one horrible actress in this franchise as she acted and looked literally the same in the last four movies. She was blinking, mouth breathing, shaking her head, expressionless, and her kept mouth open the whole time (to show off her enormous buck teeth maybe). But she looked and acted different in this movie because by keeping her mouth closed most of the time (seriously) and with lack of abnormal shaking, blinking and mouth breathing. But she got the razzie for this movie and it is not fair (I would of course gladly comply when it comes to her winning for the previous ones) because she improved a lot since her previous performances and she didn't get nominated for new moon (the movie where she gave the worst performance).Robert Pattinson is the same, same and there is nothing much to talk about. That's how it is.Taylor Launtner gave a bipolar like performance with either extreme underacting or overacting. And he also had the dumb look that we all remember him for. Ashley Greene was horrible. She was the only person I liked in new moon and she didn't do well in this.Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone, Kellan Lutz, Peter Fascinelli and Elizabeth Reaser were all just standing around doing nothing. When it comes to performance the descent ones actually are Kristen of course then there is Billy Burke, Dakota fanning and Aro's high pitched laugh. The effects were okay but I totally despised the vampires shattering like glass idea (and sparkling not to mention). Make up was good though.Then the one than shattered me and of course millions of other who expected the better outcome of this saga. The ending! (Spoiler)The fight scene at the end was really cool and it was the best part of the saga. Not because I like action scenes, but because that was where finally something with pace and consequence finally happens. You see Jane die, with Aro, Caius, Carlisle and Jasper. But no it is nothing but Alice's vision and the cowardly leader Aro almost immediately calls off the attack ignoring his friends and colleagues. (I'm sorry I'm pretty sure that they were not his friends). Again, I hate the shattering like glass concept but both Jane and Aro's deaths were done well. And yes it is ruined!!! (spoiler)The movie therefore is horrible but better compared to its preceding ones. They try to make it look interesting yet boring at the same time. It is definitely not the description the trailer 'An epic finale that will live forever'. To tell the truth it is dead long after the end credits of the movie. 3/10",3,7,17,27 August 2013
Inception," Overrated.. yet it is an entertainer that shouldn't be missed
","Dark knight and batman begins were the two movies of Christopher Nolan's i watched before inception. Batman begins was great but I wasn't that thrilled about dark Knight in spite of all the positive reviews it has received. Inception I always thought was a little bit overrated because I don't think it deserved all the Oscar nominations. Except the music category. The music was absolutely mesmerizing. Hans Zimmer is a genius. Some will find this theme a bit ridiculous but the direction alone has turned the movie completely around. I couldn't find a single minute boring. If one is watching a film like this, it should generally watched like a thriller. Not even the theme should be disclosed. The performances were great from everyone. Leonardo Dicaprio is indeed in a standard of his own. I has Ken Watanabe's best performance ever. Marion Cotillard and Ellen Page were perfect for their roles and the fine trivia behind their combination. They were once competent for the Oscar award once (Marion cotillard won the competition). Joseph Levitt Gordon, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao and Michael Caine were all good. The music was incredible. Technical aspects were all exemplary.This movie should be experienced either in an extremely good theater or in a high definition home theater system were you won't have concentration removed in any manner. Watching a low quality print takes the very spirit of movie watching. Which is exactly what will happen to those who watched it on television with so many advertisements.Inception is indeed one of those different movies that shouldn't missed. Especially by those people who wish to see something different.9/10",10,3,15,13 April 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Could have been better
","I was a big fan of the movie Batman begins. Christopher Nolan entered my all time favorite directors list. He is a gifted man with an excellent vision and completely different style of filmmaking. With movies like Memento, inception and prestige, he indeed succeeded in creating more variety and complex themes look good on screen. By sticking completely with the Batman series he is not having the opportunity to something else. So I am glad that the series ended. The Dark knight rises was a very promising film and much awaited movie. I was excited to see new additions like Anne Hathaway, Marion Cottilard, Tom Hardy and Joseph Levitt Gordon. But the movie was a great disappointment especially because the plot had too many unnecessary holes and turns. Rachel Dawes's death in Dark knight itself was a the movie's major drawback. She was an excellent character. Major one was Bruce Wayne's hiding. How can a guy lose his complete faith and be in the hiding while the city suffers? Okay he wanted a hero without a mask to rule the Gotham city. Why did he have to hide as Bruce Wayne? That was kind of cowardly act from his part. I also didn't like the part where Alfred Left. The man who nurtured him since the day he was born. Yet the direction made the movie a lot better than it is. All the actors did very job in presenting their respective characters, especially Anne Hathaway, Joseph Levitt Gordon and Gary Oldman. Movie could have been made a lot better with a little more polishing. The fight scenes were terrible. Visual and sound effects were okay. Hans Zimmer did a good job in the soundtrack. The movie is worth a onetime watch, if you are die-hard fan of the franchise. 7/10",7,1,4,10 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Best among the series!!!!
","Don't READ IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE MOVIE The one word I would use to describe Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows part 2 is 'Spectacular'. There are many reasons for it. Let me start. I was a strong fan of Harry Potter since I saw the first film. I've read all the books and the movies were also good. The series may not 100% appealing to everyone, as some may still find it difficult to swallow the idea of witches and wizards flying around on brooms etc. Some may find it stupid and childish, some may think it as rubbish when it comes to the whole concept of kids going to a school of witchcraft and wizardry. Some will find it really creative as they notice a whole new world created by J K Rowling (which is where I step in). However it goes, the biggest attraction or the plus point I find in Harry Potter series is the way they have highlighted Friendship, family, true love (and not lust unlike the twilight saga) bravery, courage,sacrifice (and not suicide) the affinity towards academic activities and education.That is what the books highlight, now the movies have to rule out as well add in a lot of things. The last movie was highly anticipated because it is end of the franchise. The movies Goblet of fire, order of the phoenix and half blood prince weren't up to to the expectations because so many cool sub plots were eliminated and th movies were just action thriller.Even Deathly hallows part 2 have many sub plots missing.Sub plots like, Harry and Ginny's relationship. I don't their relationship was shown well enough to convince the audience. In spite of that still this movie managed to capture our attentions and enter in my best movies list with help of direction, acting, music and visual effects.This film had everything, drama, humor, action, suspense and artistic scenes. David Yats improved a lot since the Order of the phoenix. Performances was good from all the actors. This film had Daniel's best performance from all the Harry Potter movie. He managed to remain steadfast and controlled. He's improved on not having a blank face. I want to see him do more good movies and roles. Emma Watson was at her best. She is no longer the geek bushy haired girl we met in philosopher's stone. She's changed and delivered a versatile performance. Hermione is true role model for every little girl and Emaa has to be the actor with the brightest future among the entire teen cast. Because she is beautiful and has a lot of caliber.Rupert was the only person i found less impressive compared to others because he had nothing much to do or deliver. Tom Felton is the handsomest guy in the series. It's a pity that the Slytherin kids had to be locked in the dungeons and not have them involved in the battle, except two of course Lord voldemort, and Severus Snape. Ralph Fiennes have more and more weird as the series progressed. Alan Rickman was totally brilliant. A lot of characters died in the series. Sirius Black was my favorite character but I didn't feel sad when he died, because I heard too many reviews on how sad his death scene was so the effect was gone. Same was in the case of dumbledore whose death is supposed to be a tear jerker. But when Snape died, I felt sad (I didn't cry though) Because the certain thought came to my mind that is they will really miss the professor who comes bursting into the class without any words and say 'Page 394'. And the whole back story of Sbnape was very touching. When he died he was no longer the person who simply terrifies Harry.The one person who didn't from the beginning was Helena Bonham Carter. She was brilliant in the sense anyone will feel like putting a cruciatus curse on Bellatrix Lestrange. Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, and all were good. Bonnie Wright was the only person I found the least worthy because. She just can't do great emotions and her character also didn't look that over whelming. Her reaction when she hears that 'Harry Potter is dead' could have presented better. Besides there should have been more depth added to the relation between Harry and Ginny. The technical part was also handled well. The movie had convincing 3D effects. There many memorable scenes like1. the bank vault where the vessels multiply when touched. 2. Dragon escape scene. 3. The final Battle where Voldemort is defeated.Alexandre Desplat music was good. I was totally in love with the Harry Potter since I listened to them on you tube just for fun. Alexandre Desplat added more to increase the depth and creepiness at some situations.The movie was wonderful and everybody did wonderful jobs and the thing is it could have been better with little more polishing. But no adaptation is perfect and all the movies managed to stand up to the best it can. The epic scene that is the final one where the trio's children go away to their time in Hogwarts we then see the trio together for the last time on the final chapter and the series is concluded.9/10",9,0,1,11 October 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," a really ugly triangle love story.....
","It is indeed a pleasure for all the twilight fans to rush into the theaters when the next chapter of the saga is released. But this one is definitely not worth the wait..... It does not thrill every teenage girl out there. And of course I knew that it is not worth it...' cause I read the story. I watched just because of a lot of persuasions and I did not want to be the only person who did not see this movie among my gang of twilight maniacs. I never spend so much time writing negative reviews about a movie. Twilight was a great movie with a great concept. I just vampire-human love story, that concept. The following series bought up a new vampire-human-werewolf triangle love story. Which was terrible and ugly. I always thought that Stephenie Meyer spoiled it all. As far as I am concerned there is no thrill in it. Many loves this movie cause they love Edward and Jacob. Probably due to their glamor. And definitely there is nothing great about Bella for them both to love.Performances were very poor. This movie has Kristen Stewart's worst performance. She behaves as if she has dual personality. Either she very calm and talks in her monotonous deep toned voice. Or she is too jumpy and just shouts at everyone around her. Many people in the theater laughed after seeing the way she says 'Dad, I am a virgin'. I completely take back my opinion about he being a very natural actress.I don't have much to say about Pattinson's performance except that he was better compared to his performance in new moon. But in a way, he made me feel sorry for Edward whenever Bella turns her back on him.Taylor Lautner was annoying. There is absolutely nothing wrong with him as far as his acting is concerned.. I loved his performance and character Jacob in twilight and half of new moon. Since the second half of new moon and eclipse he seems to loose control. Problem is either the direction or the script.Anna Kendrick, Ashley greene, Billy Burke and others managed to keep up their steadfastness. Movie was worse than the book. Some scenes looked more like stage drama. Which includes the scene where Jacob actually begs her to choose him instead of Edward and the scene where Bella prevents Edward from following Jacob in the mountains. I actually felt like running out the theater. I just the way Jacob's character was changed. The idea of him begging Bella actually made me puke. I would have considered him great if he was just like a brother for Bella, giving her good advices then it would have been okay. Even in the technical aspects one wouldn't feel like watching it. Everything about this movie is predictable. When Billy Black tells Bella the story of how a woman rescued her lover, i knew that she would do something like that to rescue Edward/Jacob. And of course the bet between Edward and Jacob. Which I knew will definitely happen. It is the worst... and the ruined everything about the series.Still people finds some thrill in this. And every one need not see the movie like I saw. Some can definitely see it as just an entertainer, or some can just it and ignore it. Mainly it is curiosity that leads people to see the next part of the saga. There is absolutely nothing funny or thrilling to see Bella or a girl like that to see between two guys. Definitely not in a movie that once had a beautiful concept. I watched it just once and I have had it.P.S i am a teenage girl and i hate this movie.just 1/10",1,7,10,15 April 2011
