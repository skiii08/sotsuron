The Lobster," Please do not suggest anyone Watch this film (or watch it yourself)
","The best advice I can give to anyone who hasn't seen this movie is to not watch the movie. DEFINITELY do not suggest anyone watch it with you. This is the type of movie that will lead to movie picking probation. Anytime in the future when your significant other or friends have a debate over what film to see, this will be the first and only exhibit presented which will result in an automatic veto of your suggestion. The only acceptable time to suggest this film is if you are trying to end a friendship or get out of a messy relationship. Now on to the movie itself.Pretentious doesn't even begin to describe this movie. You can tell early on that the director was making this for film critics and could care less about the audience. The premise is quirky and is used ad nauseam to pound the same message home.We get it. Society has dumb/superficial rules and traditions that we all go along with. When these rules are shown through the lens of a dystopian society that in some way mirrors our own culture, the absurdity of these rules is revealed. This is a valid point, but the director spends 2 painful hours hammering this same point through escalating, unnecessary violence. 'The audience is about to fall asleep for the 100th time in the first 45 minutes? Cue shot of mutilated dog.' I should have known right then that the film would have no redeeming qualities. At that point, the director had already spent way too much time upping the ante of how disturbed and uncaring the female character was.The story gets even more boring when the main character makes his way to the woods to live with the outcasts. This is when you get to spend another hour+ of your life watching the same point play out. There are quirky rules in this group as well, and the director is going to show you just how brutal and violent the repercussions are if not followed. Did the scene with the mutilated dog not shock you? Maybe cutting peoples lips/mouths with razor blades or forcing someone to have intercourse with a pig will keep you interested in the movie. Don't worry, if you still find yourself in need of more senseless violence, there's also intentional blinding and dogs eating peoples faces off.The movie is a dark, depressing, emotionless film that takes entirely too long to play out. I have no idea why a critic would like this movie. Maybe they were amazed at how the Director was able to bore an audience so thoroughly despite including the most gortesque scenes throughout the film.",1,5,7,20 February 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A tediously long, drawn-out movie with little entertainment
","I agree with a few of the other posts in that this is one of the few instances where my rating of the movie differs greatly from the avg IMDB user. I was excited to finally see this movie, and the first 15 minutes gave it a lot of promise. After that, the movie drug on without much excitement, comedy, or character development for the first half only to establish a lazy and played out plot for the second half. All of the great actors that show-up throughout the film have their talents wasted.This film is another great example of critics and film geeks lining up to shower praise on a film that a viewer could take a 45 minute nap and not miss a single thing. If you want a laugh, read the critics reviews on Rotten Tomatoes as they fall over themselves trying to praise the film.",2,2,7,19 July 2019
