Vertigo," I know I'm committing sacrilege, but...
","For some reason, over the years, I've seen only bits and pieces of this movie and never in its entirety. Finally, tonight, I did. And this is all I have to say: Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, Notorious, North by Northwest, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Rebecca, Young and Innocent, Psycho, Saboteur, Sabotage, and a few others warrant more acclaim than this over-long, over-rated, over-done and over-wrought production. It can be rated a seven-starrer and on a night when I'm feeling giddy with generosity, 8. But all in all a sour disappointment. How it managed to grow in acclaim, I am at a loss. The acting was superlative, with Stewart growing from a barely bearable personality (dull and duller) to a thoroughly dislikable fellow who'd been done wrong. Kim Novak was a delightful surprise. I've always liked her and found her to be very sympathetic whenever I've seen her - Middle of the Night, Picnic, - and a much better actress than was generally granted. In this she excelled. Barbara Bel Geddes should have been elevated to greater stardom and Tom Helmore was perfect as the heel. The photography was good, colorful, with interesting collage-like minutes of sailing/falling through air. The music was non-stop (unusual in movies) - there was never a moment when some notes were not being heard and they heightened the intensity. But...But: 2 hours and 8 minutes! No movie should be 2 hours and 8 minutes. It's like reading a fat book that can't help but repeat itself. I did like it though and would REALLY have liked it had it shaved off at least 20 minutes in the middle. But Shadow of a Doubt? Now, THAT'S movie magic. And that's my 2 cents!",7,0,2,30 September 2015
Nightcrawler," Give the guy an Academy Award, finally.
","Pretty much as good as it gets. I was at once compelled to look at and be repelled by Jake Gyllenhaal's character - a sociopath - and Los Angeles' representation of a city crawling with pathologies. The photography seemed to demonstrate the city L.A. itself as simply an onlooker, just a witness of crazed traffic and social indifference. Gyllenhaal is certainly one of the best of the young contemporary actors - Edward Norton, Johnny Depp, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey, Jr., the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, a few others. Never disappointed in what they do, even if the film is of less significance. From the start you have, at least in a few scenes, a sense of where this is going, perhaps a bit more than necessary - I'm not keen on figuring out in advance what might be happening next. But the sheer audacity and sociopathy of his character is riveting. I've rarely seen him - but Brokeback Mountain was enough in and of itself to warrant him acclaim. Rene Russo is always interesting to see and she has moved into her older years beautifully. As his hapless 'associate', Riz Ahmed may very likely find his way to the slim list of excellent actors. Too, Kevin Rahm, who appeared as a gay neighbor in Desperate Housewives and as Russo's cohort here, one of the conscientious few, showed in the few scenes he was in, a talent to disarm. When I left the theater - a very respectful, large audience - I wanted to go right home and take a shower, as if I could wash out of my mind the wantonness of the cast of characters we don't only witness but we play.",8,0,2,15 November 2014
Gone Girl," Way too long!
","In a few words, too many words were an over-kill for this endless, endless movie. Way too long. The acting was very good, but then after awhile, given the misguided length of it, the acting became just good, without any superlatives. Could have eliminated about 45 minutes and I would have given it a 7 or maybe 8 - even the 6 that I did give it was probably 1 or 2 too many. That was more for the acting than anything else. Rosamund Pike, whom I'd never seen before, is a beauty (in the beginning) and quite good. The detective and the twin sister of Affleck were very good as well and Affleck also pulled it off. No fan in particular of Neil Patrick Harris, his performance seemed to be pushed into the film and then gorily pushed out of it without having the opportunity (or ability?) to do more. Tyler Perry was a bit too jovial and flip in his role, which he customarily is (in interviews) but I find him a pleasant character. The 2 trailer trash characters could have had their scenes eliminated (although they were good) and had her money taken in some other, briefer way. Too much time spent on her psychopathology without any indication of its possible root. All in all, I was itching to get up and go out much sooner than I actually did. Really disappointed. Had been looking forward to a film noir in color and it turned out to be non-mystery in blood.",7,2,8,24 October 2014
Goodfellas," There's always one in every crowd
","I didn't read more than a few other reviews and they were all 10 stars. I'm going to be the fly in the ointment and give it a 7, which still ain't bad. And it ain't - I mean isn't - bad at all, by any means. Nor, in my book, is it anywhere near great. Not by a long shot. It may be due, largely, although not sure yet, to Joe Pesci's one note characterization (way too typical of him). A little 'f' word here and there never hurt nobody but goes just so far. It becomes not so much an aspect of his psychopathology but, with its over emphasis, weakens it, parodying what might be very legitimate. He was insane, and not a joke, but the character becomes jokey. How Ray Liotta did not get acknowledged for a much more realistic portrayal, and get at least a nomination for a part he brought dimensionality to, is a mystery. But, of course, the whole concept of an Academy Award is a mystery in and of itself. I mean, after all - Charlton Heston (in anything)?; Shirley Jones when you have Janet Leigh?; Rita Moreno opposite Judy Garland as well as Fay Bainter and Lotte Lenya?; not to mention the even more outrageous selection of Chakiris vs Clift and Geo. C. Scott?; Grace Kelly vs. Judy Garland????? Now, really! That one is going too far. And so on and forth. Give me Pesci in My Cousin Vinny anytime (not even a nomination). Aside from that - there were moments in the film that were clearly wonderful. Bracco and all the other molls getting their faces and nails done, scanning and re-scanning each of their thoughtless faces; the stop motion a dozen or more times capturing the characters silent, still; De Niro smiling at you with one of his 2 faces barely showing the 2nd face that will soon emerge and become the easy victor; the sense of confusion and then addiction that Liotta captures; the latter part where he describes in repetitive detail, in his drug-addled way, the order of the evening and transporting the pounds of cocaine to another city; dinner table with Mom and the 3 boys while the body in the trunk is writhing. Etc. A story told well enough in all of its pathetic realism. Scorcese is usually very good. It's this film that wasn't.",6,2,6,9 July 2015
