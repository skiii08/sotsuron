The Expendables 2," Expendable indeed
","This movie is garbage - not even worthy of being earthly garbage it has to be flown into space to drift into the void and beyond - totally space garbage! I had no illusions before watching this movie but when i think of it, i must have had some kind of mental setback - making me watch it against my own will.I did not enjoy it.You almost have to be some kind of patriot of bad movies to really dig this left hand work.Sly is old and way too focused on his boring one liners. Arnold is old, and way to focused on his trademark 'i'll be back' one liner - can it get more boring? Jason is cool as always (Whats he's doing in such a movie?), Willis is cool as always (How come hes in that movie is beyond my skill to analyze)!I hate that 'in the pack'/'lone wolf' talk they keep using - as if they get tougher every time they talk about it. Goodbye sly and Arnold - you've just hit pension age on all accounts.",2,1,3,24 November 2012
Thor," A Downfall for Bragnagh
","This was an output from Kenneth Branagh - and it was an utter failure. Even though some of my favorite actors appears in leading roles in this movie, it just can't raise the bar of quality. The movie is so utterly void and lost in the act of trying to spin a story around the supposedly love connection between thor and 'the mortal girl'. Where were all the details from the viking mythology? Even Sleipner, odins horse, missed several legs - and if it had its 8 legs, it was not even properly portraited. I can't recommend this movie. Kenneth Bragnagh should go Broadway and stay there.",2,2,5,21 May 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Not very good.
","the stars goes for the special effects, the rest is worthless. One to many smart one liners in this movie. Rosie Huntington should never have been a part of this, and if you really disagree then someone have messed with the intentions of her casting - cuz she's boring and I can't see what the meaning of her part of the movie is - other than standing here and there in tight dresses.Shia is OK. But that does not save this franchise.I could puke for all the one liners this movie has implemented, and someone very very in lack of imagination should have chosen to make a coca cola commercial instead of wasting ours and their own time on this project. Transformers has been deemed dead after this failure. Franchise over!",2,5,12,17 September 2011
