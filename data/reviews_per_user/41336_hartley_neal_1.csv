Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Let's have more like this!
","Went to see this film, not knowing what to expect having read many varied reviews and seeing the trailer when viewing another film. I was not disappointed, the trailer was brilliant and the film even better. I can see why some people would not appreciate the extremely clever humour in this film, everything that happens and everything that is said in this film, has a point to make about ourselves and our society and it is delivered with the most incredible comic timing. Sacha's performance is completely solid throughout and you can be completely forgiven for believing that his Borat character is real. His accent never wavers and there is no hint on his face that the extreme real situations he finds himself in, are in any way phasing him. This is a 'must see' film, I have never laughed so much (sometimes painfully so) even the credits section of the film is good. I was still breaking out in a smile and a laugh an hour after the film had ended. This film will spawn many other likewise films, it is a breakthrough film, all countries of this world could do with a Borat to shake them up, not least, those that are supposed to be more civilised!Thankyou Sacha",10,2,14,26 November 2006
