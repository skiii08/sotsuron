Bird Box," Unsure what the hype is all about
","I finally sat down and watched Birdbox. I had heard so much about it and I figured it was time to take the 2 hour journey. Honestly, I was very disappointed. Mostly because I went into this movie with high expectations. If you're going to watch it, I advise to go in with an open mind and low expectations. Props go to the actors, as the acting was quite good. But as far as the storyline, plot and length of the movie... it loses marks there. For me, the best part of the movie was that Machine Gun Kelly plays a role, and a part of me was waiting for his death due to seeing his greatest fear... Eminem. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen but I'm sure the internet will take care of that for us. Anyway, 4/10 for me. Dragged on for way too long.",4,2,3,24 January 2019
