The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch has set a precedence for this type of genre that was fun and enjoyable to watch.
","Heather Donahue decides to do a documentary about the urban legend of The Blair Witch. She takes along two other film students, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams, who are just as eager to do the project as she is. Their trip was planned to go to Maryland, interview some townsfolk, film some of the historic sites in the woods and return home. A year later their camera footage was found.Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo SÃ¡nchez decided to break away from the traditional cinematography and go with a first person view of the events that take place. We actually watch the majority of the movie through Heather Donahue's eyes. It was pretty creative and went well with the story and the actors.The Blair Witch is really a feeling movie. You have to pay a lot of attention to the film and really get into the mood the scenery and actors are trying to set. There isn't any monsters, no ghosts and no gore to be seen. You have to use your imagination and focus on the feelings of the actors. Heather Donahue and the rest of the crew do some great acting to suck you in and make you really feel like you are there scared for your life right along with them. The story kinda stalls towards the end as it seemed like they added some scenes in to make the movie longer but not noticeable on your first watch through.The Blair Witch has set a precedence for this type of genre that was fun and enjoyable to watch. I recommend The Blair Witch to any fan and look forward to more movies of this genre.",7,3,6,16 April 2013
Pitch Black," I can't recommend Pitch Black enough!
","The opening scene starts off action filled as we watch a cargo ship carrying a group of diverse passengers run through a meteor storm. Its all the assumed captain Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) can do to try and land the ship in one piece. While the passengers gather their wits they learn they are stranded on a desert planet with a convict, Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), a cop, Johns (Cole Hauser) and no water. After a death and a sighting they realize they are not alone on this planet and trying to find a way off becomes a priority. As the story unfolds they learn that every 22 years the planet goes through an everlasting darkness and as fate would have it, that time is now. The crew not only struggles with what the darkness brings but they struggle with themselves as they fight to survive, with their hero coming from an unlikely source.Every actor fit their respective characters to a 'T'. They portrayed exactly what director David Twohy was trying to get across. They each have their own little story surrounding them and integrated it into the flow of the movie spot on. The character development is so in tune with the events of the movie you feel a connection with the characters as they progress. You watch as they all start out as somebody but transform into somebody else at the end of the film. The cinematography and lighting throughout the movie is exceptional. The planet they are stranded on actually has three suns, each with their own set of colors mixed on the different pieces of scenery.Onto the aliens. They are original, creative, well designed for their environment and extremely ruthless. Their origin is unclear but their intentions are well known. They destroyed everything on the planet and are blood thirsty for more. Their mouth full of large teeth, ability to fly and movement/echo based vision easily put them at top of the food chain.Pitch Black quickly entered into my top 15 of favorite movies after viewing it. It has something for everybody. Very well written, sci-fi feel to it, action and some gore. Its the type of movie you can sit down and watch many times over. I can't recommend it enough.",10,0,1,2 April 2013
Evil Dead," I found the movie very enjoyable to watch
","We have a girl. A girl with an addiction to drugs. Mia (Jane Levy) decides to better herself and quit her addiction cold turkey. With the help of her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and her friends, she is determined to get through the withdrawal process once and for all. They choose a remote cabin deep in the woods with no outside influence to help Mia recover. While cleaning up the cabin, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), one of Mia's friends, finds a book and decides to read it. Not knowing the evil he is about to unleash, Eric reads the book out loud. The fight for survival now begins.Not really sure where to take this one. I am kinda of on the fence. Director Fede Alvarez teeter totters from a brilliant really dark horror movie to an average film. I believe if he would have stayed on track with the way the movie started out and focused on the darker side of evil, he would have had a masterpiece.The character development was sparse. We picked up bits and pieces about the characters as the movie went on but nothing that really impacted how the story was told. Even with the lack of background, the actors did very well. Their reactions to what transpired were very believable and true. Shiloh Fernandez could have played a stronger character. He lacked the take charge attitude a lead actor should have and kind of got lost in with the others at times but overall they all did decent.Any GORE fans out there? Well we have some gore for you! Minus one scene, Fede Alvarez kept the gore coming. He was able to throw more and more gore into this movie without making it a grind-house featurette. It was very well done, believable and as tasteful as gore can get.I also want to give credit to the entire makeup department. I absolutely loved the disfigurements they came up with and were able to put together. The cuts, bruises, missing limbs and hacked-up faces were outstanding looking. I am looking forward to the special features on Blu-ray for this.I did not compare any part of this to the original Evil Dead as I believe every movie should have a fair shake. I found the movie very enjoyable to watch. The way the demon plays with the characters and unique gore scenes are a huge draw. What the movie lacks in story and guidance, it makes up for in cinematography and good ole fashion gore.",9,9,28,10 April 2013
