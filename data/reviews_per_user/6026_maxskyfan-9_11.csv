The Equalizer," The Love of Battle Was Not Neglected
","This picture looks like it is a well-made over the top revenge film, but it is more in the line of a setting things right for the other characters type of story. It looks like this film was based on the TV show of the same name that was released in the '80s. According to IMDb the TV creator got a movie credit. The action and violence in this picture is highly realistic and often brutal. Robert McCall is not the type of guy to go in locked and loaded and blaze away. He is more like to pick up weapons off his targets and make do with what they have lying around like corkscrews or even a shot glass. He is pretty much deadly with anything. I was reminded of Man on Fire (2004) when I was watching this, another Denzel film with a pretty and young, white girl in trouble with the same determination from the protagonist. Still I recommend 'The Equalizer'. The story continually builds upon itself slowly revealing the larger scope of our hero's world and the director was very mindful of his spaces and was careful where objects were placed and shown. I was pleasantly surprised to keep finding things slide into place in front of the camera. But the love of battle was not neglected. The fight scenes used elaborate setups in editing where extreme close ups of the protagonist's eye would show a reflection of the room, mixed in with half a dozen of cutaway shots this was graphically brilliant in its imagination and ever so off-putting in its gory nature.",9,5,20,27 September 2014
If I Stay," An Interesting Conflict That I Haven't Seen Before
","PlotMia Hall (Chloe Grace Moretz) is in a car accident with her mother Kat (Mireille Enos), her father Denny (Joshua Leonard) and her brother Teddy (Jakob Davies). She is the only one who survives the accident. She is able to experience the ordeal in an outer body state and travel about the hospital eavesdropping on conversations. The movie juxtaposes this part of the film with glimpses of moments in scenes of events that occurred before this accident of Mia's life with the time of the people that she cared about and the family that she lost in the accident. She seems to have the power to decide if she is going to wake up and fight to continue live her life with the ones that are still there for her or slip away into the hereafter. The question is: If I stay?Character DevelopmentMia Hall love interest is Adam (Jamie Blackley) and together their relationship makes up the core of the film. From their beginnings and through their struggles and the moments at her bedside at the hospital - this is the path the film takes you on that is much of their story and little does deviate from this course.ActingThere were many moments of some wonderful acting with some great showing of song and singing and music playing. It is questionable that all the performances are performed by the cast, but still is made believable on film and the end result was quite moving just the same.OverviewOutside of Mia relationship with Adam, she struggles with her playing the cello and how her love of classic music differs with that of her family and her boyfriend. The minor conflict is playing in the background behind her overall feeling of Adam and how her love of music will not blend with that of his. This is an interesting conflict that I haven't seen before, and mixed with the outer body experience which is more or less well known work very well in a new and fresh way. Then the story has a delightful blend of mixing past and current events together with a desirable effect. The film is able to take an element that has been done before and make it special with some added flare.",8,0,1,28 September 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This Movie Hit All the Pressure Points
","PlotIn the near future the government designs and manufactures hundreds of giant flying robots that are virtually unstoppable to the X-Men who are their intended targets. With the X-Men dropping like flies Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian Mckellen) advice a plan to reset time and wipe these murderous machines from existence. They theorize that they can send Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) consciences back in time to his younger self so he can fix the time-line to their advantage by removing one event from spiraling out of control. But even with certain doom being leveled on top of them the X-Men of the past are reluctant and even refusing to cooperate. Now it is up to Wolverine to make them listen as the future steadily approaches.Character DevelopmentJust like the acting this wasn't a film for giving room in the story for character development. All changes in behavior were mostly instantaneous. The story channels this as smoothly and easily as coming about in a sailboat and with as much planning and effort.ActingSome moments shine better than others, but this isn't really an acting picture. It is more of a reacting picture, yet I give all the cast accolades for dodging obstacles and pretending that a world exists that isn't really there. Beyond the dazzle and spectacular brilliance that could describe most of this film there were the times that the acting leaped past the perfunctory, it is in those scenes which gave the acting some added weight, the scattered moments where the dialog lasted more than a minute and gave the time where a character could emote a feeling.OverviewAs a new installment to the X-Men franchise this movie hit all the pressure points. The special effects were top notch and the story made a great deal of sense. Judging from the collective skill-sets that all the X-Men possess when they are working together there would need to be an antagonist that would be a powerful threat and I believe that the producers have pulled out all the stops to make that happen. I was genuinely impressed. It was also enjoyable to see how the story would tie the new and old X-Men together. I was reminded how the new and old cast members of Star Trek franchise were tie together for their one big film â€” 'Star Trek: Generations' (1994). I think this X-Men film tops that old next-generation film though. There were so many well moving parts in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. The time travel aspect was quite creative. It was like the same device Christopher Reeve's character used in 'Somewhere in Time' (1980), by a means of projecting himself into the past by using the power of his mind. And who better to traverse the past than Wolverine, he seems to be the glue that hold the X-Men franchise together. No other character has been given two movies solely to themselves. He is in fact the bridge that connects both story lines. I hear this is just the start to a larger universe of X-Men to come and if so they have laid the foundation for a bright and fruitful future.",9,1,3,27 September 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," The Energy Was Palpable When They Wade The Effort
","PlotHazel (Shailene Woodley) has cancer and may die of it. The prospects don't look great. Her mother (Laura Dern) is worried about her and thinks she is depressed because she keeps rereading the same book so she instructs Hazel to go to a cancer support group. During the course of a meeting she is introduced to Gus (Ansel Elgort) and Isaac (Nat Wolff). Gus makes a pass at Hazel who looked intrigued by the offer, but not all together moved by it. Slowly Gus is successful in winning Hazel's affections after agreeing to read her favorite book. It is after this time when Hazel confides in Gus that she tried to contact the author and was unable to get a reply. Later when Gus tries contacting the author he gets an invitation to meet the author himself at his home in Amsterdam. Hazel is delighted in having the opportunity to talk to her beloved author in person and discuss what happened to the characters in the story she was reading after the book was finished. Only she doesn't know if she can make the trip because her doctors told her she is too sick to go and her mom told her they might not be able to afford it.Character DevelopmentThe impressive trend of this film is that the whole cast goes through a transformation of one kind or another and unlike a great many films, this film's time-line leaves room for that to happen. The two leads spend much of the screen time with one another and slowly build a relationship. An interesting element of the storytelling involves superimposing text-ting messages and emails onto the screen instead of having the audience read over someone's shoulder. And then there was a tender moment when the couple picked one special word they would use to signify their love.ActingImpressive acting all around, though Nat Wolff's character was at times very irritating, but I don't know how much of it is the actor's fault and how much of that is the writing. I think it could swing either way; most likely something that the director (Josh Boone) could have squared away if he had the means. I also thought that Sam Trammell's character was underutilized, but that would be another problem with the writing. He had a couple poignant little scenes, only it wasn't much. He was left behind a great deal of the way. Willem Dafoe was another actor that was underutilized, though that had to do with the fact that he was given a small role. I know it is said that there are no small roles, only small actors; yet the honest truth is that he had a small role and he did the best with it that he could and he did show some growth.OverviewThere are a few unforeseen twists along the way that keeps this rather weepy tale from getting stale and they all work within the logic framework of the story and are quite clever in their design. Nothing can be taken for granted here and about anything could happen. One thread of the story goes one way and just when you think it has run its course it continues along the same path in the next scene. Generally I was entertained for the most part, yet there were moments and some unpleasant stretches of time that began to lull a bit too much or irritate. I could definitely notice this awkwardness because when things began to fall into place in the end and I could feel the difference in the storytelling. The energy was palpable when they made the effort.",8,0,2,28 September 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Much Better Without A Dunst
","PlotMax Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is a brilliant little worker at Oscorp, but he is routinely mistreated and given no credit for his work which his company has made a fortune on. One day Max inadvertently stumbles into oncoming traffic and then is saved by Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). From that time on Max is obsessed with all things Spider-Man. Then one night Max is forced to work late on his birthday and while doing so accidentally falls victim to his own extreme awkwardness and ends up getting himself electrocuted and consequently becoming a super-powered entity known as the Electro. Needless to say Electro goes on a path of destruction and when Spiderman-Man tries to stop him and we soon see that Electro's hero worship of Spider-Man has become that overwhelming hatred. Meanwhile Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) shows up in town and takes over Oscorp after his father's passing. Harry is an old friend of Peter Parker and when Peter comes to visit Harry, Harry confides in him that he is dying and the only thing that can save him is Spider-Man's blood. Since it is public knowledge that Peter Parker takes photos of Spider- man Harry believes that his friend Peter can get word to him. Now Peter is face with letting his friend die or dealing with the ramifications of giving someone his highly advance blood.Character DevelopmentPlaying a superhero can carry an emotional toll on someone's sense of well-being. Spider-Man is one of those superheroes where that toll is very taxing and in this film he is faced with turmoil outside of the battlefield which makes this story very compelling to a large degree. We soon learn from the beginning of the film that Peter Parker is be tugged down with the guilt of not keeping the promise he made with his girlfriend's father and these thoughts plague him throughout the film. Unlike a character like Superman, Spider-man is not bulletproof and his life in this film is held in consist jeopardy, yet he remains venerable just as much when he is just Peter Parker. ActingI have heard some blow-back with Andrew Garfield playing the lead role of Spider-Man, but I find him serviceable to his predecessor who I did find was slightly annoying at times so I didn't really see the rub. In this film Jamie Foxx plays one of the villains and he did remind me of Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker in Spider-Man (2002) and if you can compare those two performances you can see what direction the others films took and see how these films differ. This Spider-Man is more confident and self-assured and I think that is a good thing. The only real flaw I can find is with Dane DeHaan, not this acting per se, but with the time he was allowed to do it. His time on screen was very light for that of a villain and didn't have much weight because of it, which in my mind came off as somewhat an afterthought as it did a means to an end in telling a story.OverviewWhen I compare Spider-Man (2002) with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) I have faced with some ground-breaking achievement, some brilliant improvements and I am not writing about the special effects that are much more enhanced. I am talking about the casting of Peter Parker's love interest Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who is many levels the superior performer of Kirsten Dunst who played Mary Jane Watson in Spider-Man and the rest of earlier series of films by Sam Raimi, it would have seem that the director wasn't in charge of the casting at all or lost a bet or something. Every minute Dunst was on the screen I would cringe, one moment she was saccharin sweet and the next she was unbelievable distant. She played the role with no range, no nuance. I do not know how I could fault the director when Dunst was the only indelible black mark on the picture which is ironic because she does look appealing on a movie poster after it has been touched up. If it wasn't so detrimental to the film it would be comical that Dunst plays an actress as part of her role. Why is it that those actors that play actors cannot act? I think it was true for Joey on Friends and that guy in Taxi who played a struggling actor. Maybe it is because they can play an actor slightly worst, but they know they cannot play an actor no better. Frankly I am surprised that Kirsten Dunst doesn't get more mockery from her name. Doesn't 'Dunst' sound like 'dunce'? She does play to the stereotype of a dumb blonde after all. Somehow I am not one who finds that endearing and am glad to see that was improved on.",9,2,5,28 September 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Live Action Comic At Its Best
","PlotPeter Quill (Chris Pratt) is exploring a planet and finds a sphere that he plans to sell for a few bucks, but he is not the only one who is looking for it. Little does he know that this sphere contains god-like power that could destroy a planet. While he is transporting this object he is detained by the authorities and incarcerated with Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Together they escape prison, but lose the almighty sphere. Now it is a race against time and space to stop a madman before he can extinguish countless lives in an instant.Character DevelopmentPeter Quill does development slightly, which is to say there is a basic hand-off from the storytelling in beginning of the story to the end. A very clever device, where some of those dots were connected and where some of them were not, but the Peter Quill character doesn't have a lot going on below the surface. None of the characters really did. These are some pretty sketchy individuals, which were far more animated by the actors playing them than what is written about them. They seem to have been given just enough motivation to get from scene to scene.ActingTwo of the main characters are computer generated and look as good as the other three that are played by human begins. Zoe Saldana is an odd addition to the human side because she played a digital character in Avatar (2009). Mostly everyone's acting was either played for laughs or for comic book violence, complete with dull weapons and no blood.OverviewI think we have reached a point in filmmaking where you can have CGI characters without them looking like CGI characters. In this film you are going to know right away that the talking raccoon isn't real, but in this film it is made to look real and far more enjoyable to watch than other CGI characters that have spent far too long on the screen. The digital characters in this film seemed like they fit in with the rest of the cast mostly because this film didn't take anything seriously. It is far easier to have a talking tree and talking raccoon with the rest of your cast when your protagonist is a stand up comic.",9,0,3,5 August 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," At Times This Story Was Very Entertaining
","PlotCage (Tom Cruise) is a public relations officer and just about the worst soldier you would ever meet. General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders him to the front lines. Cage doesn't want to go and even threatens the General who then strips Cage of rank, demoting him to private. Afterwards Cage is taken in handcuffs to Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) who gets him familiar with his new squad. The next day they mobilize for a massive operation, in which Cage is killed, but Cage doesn't stay dead, instead he wakes up being introduced to Master Sergeant Farell all over again. The next time Cage finds himself on the battlefield he meets Rita (Emily Blunt) who had the same problem. Together they compare notes and find a new way to strike at the enemy.Character DevelopmentCage generally makes a complete turn to who he was at the beginning of the picture to where he ends up, yet the emotional reward is just not there with the Cage (Tom Cruise) like it was with Phil (Bill Murray) in 'Groundhog Day' (1993). I think the character General Brigham was right when he called what was happening all around him 'one big trick'.ActingThough there were a few tender moments, this wasn't the place for much in the way of acting and much more time was utilized in reacting and stunt work. The points in this story were it slowed to lay some emotion was in my opinion a mistake where the two leads were made to touch lips, which seemed out of character and out of place on the battlefield.OverviewAt times this story was very entertaining. There is no getting around that fact though that this was another version of 'Groundhog Day' (1993). The only difference was in this movie the story here tried to find a rational explanation to why the protagonist was reliving the same day over and over again. And like 'Groundhog Day' (1993) Tom Cruise's character demonstrates his godlike powers of knowing everything about everyone around him. What I found disappointed about this film was how it seemed to get stuck switching gears. One minute it a series of living and dying and the next it tea time in the farmhouse. The pace was definitely off at times. Yet the action and special effects seemed to be working well, only I thought the alien moved with such incredible speed it just didn't appear to be realistic. Out of all the thought and planning that went into the production of this film the designs of the alien race had to be the weakest element. All the world's nations unite to fight them and there is nothing to see. Just a bunch of downed human aircraft and soldiers. What is the enemy using to knock our stuff out of the sky? They are like a bunch of snipers you cannot spot.",8,2,5,29 September 2014
Iron Man," Plenty of Moving Parts In This Movie
","PlotTony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) travels to Afghanistan to showcase his new wares to the United States Army. The demonstration goes as planned, but on his way back to base he is attacked, injured and held for ransom by a local warlord. He is given materials and told to build weapons for his captors, only he plans for escape instead by constructing an armed metal suit. With the help of a fellow inmate he earns his freedom and is soon rescued. Upon returning home he surprises his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) when he talks openly about not having his company manufacture weapons anymore. At the same time Tony is distancing himself from Obadiah he is growing closer to his longtime employee Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), but most of the hours of the day are spent designing and building a more advance version of the suit that he used to escape with.Character DevelopmentThe Tony Stark protagonist is such an unbelievably shallow character it would seem easy to let the performance just go as that, but there were degrees of change to show some growth from earlier scenes. Yet I wish Tony was not so wisecracking all the time and was a little more serious. The only thing that seemed to silence his manic streak were great pain and near death experiences. Mostly it was a consist state of clownishness. The rest of the cast played into this storm like a twister would suck up a farmhouse. Tony's character completely ran over everyone and everyone was a victim to it.ActingMost of the cast was quite enjoyable. Robert Downey Jr. played the lead well, Gwyneth Paltrow was very charming, but I will have to give the most accolades to Jeff Bridges for playing a rich and well-rounded part. He is the one who really brought this picture together.OverviewThere is plenty of moving parts in this movie so there is much joy in seeing them come together. The sides here shift and not everything is a known quality. It is clever in how the conclusion came together, which shows some forethought and planning on part of the writers and director. The overall completion definitely covers up the imperfections of the sum of its parts.",9,1,3,28 September 2014
Lucy," 100% on the Excitement Meter
","PlotLucy (Scarlett Johansson) has the worst boyfriend in the world. He has just forced her to transport a locked briefcase to Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) by handcuffing the case to her wrist. When Mr. Jang gets hold of her he has her operated on so they can make her a drug mule. As this part of the story is being told Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) is giving a lecture discussing what the likely possibilities if someone used more than ten percent of their brain. While he dazzles his audience with his best guesses to what could happen Lucy is experiencing the effects of expanding her mind firsthand because one of Mr. Jang's goons struck her in the stomach and ruptured the designer drug that had been inserted there. Somehow this has sparked a learning curve that has increased her understanding and improved her brain function where she is using more than twenty percent of her brain. With these new found powers of intellect she is able to defeat Mr. Jang's goons and get to a hospital so they can remove the leaking drug bag from her abdomen. It is here that she gleams with godlike understanding that she doesn't have long to live so makes plans to visit Mr. Jang for some answers and Professor Norman for some insight.ActingThis wasn't much of a film for acting. There was far more reacting to special effects that weren't there or the physical effects that were. There was a degree of skill from Scarlett Johansson I suppose in how she acted before she got her powers and after. And it was impressive as always to remember all your lines the way that she does, but with a film like this there is only so much talent you can show. Then there was Morgan Freeman who added a great deal of credibility to this science fiction with his tone of voice and presence. I am sure the production team wanted him because he hosts the science show 'Through the Wormhole' on TV. I don't think that could have picked someone to do a better playing Professor Norman.Character DevelopmentLucy continues to increase with power, but that is not the same as character development so no there was very little change in any direction. If anything characters began to simplify.OverviewThis was a well told action film that didn't try to be more than it was. The special effects were as good as I have seen anywhere. There is one moment in the film that it looks like Lucy can control time. Just to get to this point is something worth to be experienced. She is able to transport herself to New York City at Times Square and with the wave of her hand she stops time. Then she speeds it up like she just hit the fast forward button. A moment later she rewinds it to the point where Times Square doesn't exist and there are just horse and buggies. Then further back she goes until she comes across some Indians and further still to the dinosaurs. Throw in a bunch of gun violence and a massive roadway chase down one way streets and over sidewalks and along with many crashes and you have quite a spectacle.",10,7,25,26 July 2014
Her," Eat Your Heart Out Bill Gates
","PlotTheodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a writer who works for a company that produces professional written letters for the public. He is going through a rough patch with his marriage breaking up and he is feeling out of sorts when he buys a new operating system that is designed to cover all his possible problems. It does this and more. This operating system is incredibly intelligent from the beginning. After Theodore sets up the system with a female voice the system names itself Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Samantha and Theodore form a long lasting relationship which not everyone is understanding about, but soon there are developments that not even Theodore can overlook. He turns to his human friend Amy (Amy Adams) for some help and guidance.Character DevelopmentThis has been a film of development from the start with Samantha and Theodore. During the course of the film there are glimpses into the past with Theodore's soon to be ex-wife and how that relationship fell apart. It was almost like a documentary in its telling, building upon event after event. The path forward and back is clearly marked.ActingThere were a lot of rich details in the acting and it was done in complete seriousness. This was not a script that played for laughs.OverviewThe writing was really well done. I could tell that there was plenty of planning in the sequences. One effective touch was the playing of Theodore's relationship in flashbacks with his soon to be ex-wife bit by bit while telling the current events of Theodore with Samantha and the rest of the world. Another good effort was with the added drama with Samantha developing feelings and Theodore finding fault with her and Samantha becoming emotional because of that. One nice moment was when Theodore noticed that Samantha was inhaling before she spoke. He rationalized with Samantha that machines do not need to breath. Both characters would push each other and both characters developed beyond the point at which they started. Just like a real relationship.",9,0,1,28 September 2014
Back to the Future," Both Humorous and Entertaining
","PlotMarty's good friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, invents a time machine in the form of a sports car and because of unforeseen circumstances Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 where he ends up meeting his parents and inadvertently fowls up how his parents come together and fall in love. This blunder endangers Marty's very existence because if his parents don't become an item he will never be born so Marty must move heaven and earth to get his parents on a road to romantic bliss. Meanwhile the younger version of Dr. Emmett Brown must find a way to get his time machine working so he can get Marty back to his own time.Character DevelopmentThe lead character Marty McFly doesn't experience much character development, but he is able to influence others dramatically. Only these developments aren't the focus of the story and mostly happen off screenActingOne of the ingredients that are equal to the magic of the story itself is the acting. The characters come to life on screen and carry over to everyday life. This has become an event film that has worked its way from pop culture to film history that has helped mark a decade. There is nothing second rate when it comes to the acting for there are no false moments in any of the cast's performances. Though there is a lot of action and racing about, much of what makes repeated viewing of this film possible are the humorous situations that Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) keep getting themselves into and how they react to them. All the lead actors do stellar work and make the trouble that Marty and Emmett get into very believable.OverviewThere are a lot surprises that are both humorous and entertaining. Again the writing is on a level all to its own where one scene snaps perfectly with the next. There never seems to be a moment in time that doesn't connect to a later moment. It is quite brilliant and the transformation from the cast's older to younger selves is really amazing. Mix this with the energy of the soundtrack and this has got to be one of best movies of the 80s if not that of all time. Top marks all around.",10,8,9,28 September 2014
