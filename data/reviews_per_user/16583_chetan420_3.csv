Blade Runner 2049," Movie of the decade
","This is easily one of the best sci-fi movies (or any genre really) that I've ever seen and Denis Villeneuve is possibly my new favourite director since David Lynch. Everything from the direction, cinematography, acting to the soundtrack, screenplay etc is great. It stays true to the original yet is its own thing, and does it so sublimely that it is the type of rare sequel that enriches the original.The only complaint one could possibly have is with the slow pace and that it's not easy viewing like the average popcorn flick, though that has more to do with one's expectations. It is an intense and long film and not really suited for anyone with a short attention span or made for instant gratification. Other than that though, one doesn't get to see such outstanding and beautifully made movies too often. There are many movies that undeservedly earn the 'masterpiece' tag (the best current example in 2019 being the highly overrated Joker film), but a couple of years before that came this bonafide masterpiece that comparatively speaking slipped under the radar and didn't get as much attention. Villeneuve gives a masterclass in what a character study actually should be, and It's difficult to imagine how much worse BR2049 would have been in the hands of a hack like Todd Phillips or vice versa.This is easily the best movie of the decade for me and definitely up there with the best I've ever seen, apart from also being possibly the best sequel ever.",10,3,10,31 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," EndLame is disappointing and messy
","Just 3 hours of fan service that doesn't really hold up to any scrutiny and doesn't really make sense from an objective standpoint. Obviously all (or most) superhero movies require a suspension of disbelief but they should atleast hold up to their own presumptions. When you start bending the whole narrative structure for some big moments, it just lessens the impact imho. Like for example, some big moments like Grandpa Rogers being there just for the sake of creating an emotional response, even though it massively undermines the character, or the specific choice of 5 years so they can force a 4 year old Morgan into the story for greater emotional impact.I've read a lot of comic books (mostly batman though), and have to hand it to marvel that they have mostly done a better job than DC with the movies, some examples being IW (my favourite MCU movie), Dr. Strange, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Thor Ragnarok, and Black Panther (overrated but still pretty good). Endgame is definitely not in that list, infact so much so that I feel 'Endlame' would've been a more honest and appropriate title.It makes no sense on so many levels, they basically reduced Thanos to a caricature (he had some impact in IW but here he's just a generic evil bad guy who doesn't think much), and time travel is the ultimate cop-out. I could go on with all the flaws and really dumb stuff (how the hell does Laura Barton's cellphone still work üòÅ, the power levels make no sense, Captain Marvel is conspicuously missing through most of it and why is she not aware of Thanos' genocide across planets etc), but basically the movie was absolute rubbish and takes massive liberties and leaps of logic which the fanboys blindly accept.I've been in the minority when it comes to movies before. I loved the universally panned BvS, though I'll add that the ultimate edition is the only one to watch. Sure it had it's share of silliness like the 'Martha' moment, but that movie got badly burned as a result while none of that seems to be affecting endgame. BvS did try (maybe too hard) to be different, but endgame just comes across as formulaic and deeply flawed.Marvel have at least stayed true to their formula though, while Warner Bros didn't have it in them to stick to the original vision. If they had stuck with Zack Snyder's planned 5-movie arc then we might have got Thanos AND Darkseid in the same year, which might've made both cinematic universes more interesting.",3,77,131,9 May 2019
Joker," Overrated and badly directed film with a misleading title
","Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's 'inspired' by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today.",3,161,325,11 October 2019
