Casablanca," The most overrated film of all time
","Style?  What style?  This had no style, and the script was one cheesy line after the other.  It is the perfect soap opera, it fooled people to believe it is more than what it is.  And aside from Bogart and Bergman, the cast was overacting to an extreme. It all feels Disneyesque, with a touch of musical wannabe.  Also, I can't help but laugh at the special effects involved in this film, and the bad editing at times.  Talk about hurrying a film's production...Don't get me wrong.  I've enjoyed 'The Godfather', the 'Star Wars' trilogy, 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Citizen Kane', 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'A Bridge on the River Kwai', anything by Stanley Kubrick, and many others that are on the alleged 'classics' list.  But this one I detest.  Burn it now, I say...",1,49,149,22 October 1998
The Bodyguard," An awful film ....
","An awful film, which does NOT work.  The recreation of the Oscars is awful (heck, even 'Naked Gun 33 1/3' did a better job!).  Whitney Houston cannot act, and Costner is in robot mode.  The soundtrack is bad as well, and too much of the film is concentrated on it... The plot is pure old Hollywood garbage that I thought had stopped being made a couple of decades before... A complete nightmare, and hard to sit through... It sure deserves to be in the Bottom 100 list...",1,8,20,18 September 1999
Velvet Goldmine," Bizarre does not mean brilliant, nor does gay...
","I'm a fan of films where the director plays around with issues, images, and styles, in the most bizarre manner.  This is an exception.  It was trash. It was trying to be 'Citizen Kane' mixed into the glam rock version of 'The Doors', trying to retell the rise of glam rock through two characters that are meant to be David Bowie and Iggy Pop (with other names for legal reasons, of course).  Adds several bizarre shots, makes one or two attacks at the music industry, and plays out gay fantasies of the reporter.  Could have been more interesting but it turned out being the most boring film I've watched since 'Motal Kombat: Annihilation'.  The performances were good, but the film goes nowhere, starting many things that it never finishes, or finishing things it never started... 3 out 10...",3,2,8,24 October 1998
