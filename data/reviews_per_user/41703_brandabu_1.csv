Requiem for a Dream," pathetic trash nicely shot
","Arsty-farsty shooting and gritty squalor cannot save this howlingly overblown cautionary tale.From the deluded fat TV widow to the sinister black drug pusher, to the naive twerps brought low by the evils of drugs, there is not one character interesting enough to be played by a non-beautiful actor.There's really no reason to have shot this live action. In fact, if Jack Chick ever gives up drawing religious pamphlets and tries his hand at screenplays, he'll probably come up with something just like this.Lots of talented players, a great score, and a somewhat interesting story make it a real shame that this film is so annoyingly overrated and that it fails so badly. Despite snappy editing, some naughty director's cut sex footage and strong acting, this movie has the artistic value of a 1950s pot-scare movie shown in high-school phys ed.The emotional impact of the plot is about as subtle as a bunker-buster falling on a box of puppies in slow motion.",2,13,26,30 May 2006
