Requiem for a Dream," The prisoner, the prostitute, the human vegetable, and the one armed man.
","This movie was great artistically but not very entertaining altogether.  It utilized great film making and directing and if you can view it only as a piece of artwork then maybe its an 8 or 9.  However, I think that great movie must be both great films artistically, and wholly entertaining and captivating.  Requiem for a Dream was not that for me.",6,1,2,1 June 2001
Se7en," Seven is a Ten!
","Hey, I won't give a ten to very many movies, but this is just a great movie. The quality of acting is great, the storyline superb, and everything down to the tiny details like the opening credits match perfectly with the mysterious, creepy feel of this film.  It has both Hollywood star power and small studio care in the making and editing.  And what an ending!  If this movie were put out today with the awards these actors have won and the names they've made for themselves it would reign for months in theatres and get a few Academy nods.  A suspense thriller for all time.",10,0,0,3 March 2001
Dumb and Dumber," Hilarious Stupidity! A ten!
","Yes, I have seen all the bad reviews and all the film critics and 'experts' have ripped it to shreds, but who cares!  Of course they would because it is based on the slapstick, pottymouth humor of the Farrelly Brothers. Basically if you like this kind of humor and can appreciate the depth of the movie, it might be the best movie you've ever seen.  It really is amazing though how much effort must have gone into the writing of the lines for this movie.  While the story is not going to win an Academy Award, every line that is spoken in this movie is part of a joke, NO FILLER!  This means there are few parts where it slows down enough to let your stomach rest from laughing.  Some of the jokes I am still figuring out or hearing after seeing it multiple times (I bet she'll invite us in for some tea and strumpets (prostitutes).  I am both a movie fan and a fan of this type of comedy so I can appreciate it from both angles and I love it.  No matter how many times I watch this movie, it is still funny.  And if you aren't a fan of this type of comedy, then why are you reading this anyways?",10,0,0,3 March 2001
