National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Pretty good sequel
","As sequels go, this one was better than most. The action was as good as the original, and Ed Harris is a really good bad guy. The scenery from around the world and the country was incredible.It's full of good one-liners, and once again Riley gets some of the best.The premise of the movie is pretty good, the idea that Ben Gates would take up the hunt to clear his great-great-grandfather's name as a conspirator (maybe even the mastermind) of President Lincoln's assassination.But I can't give this movie a 9 or 10, simply because that's the one loose end they don't tie up. Neither my wife nor I have any idea what it was about finding the city of gold that prompted the headline that clears Thomas Gates.If there is a third (and I'm guessing that whatever it is on page 47 will lead us down that road), I hope the writers and director(s) fill in all the gaps.",8,0,4,25 December 2007
