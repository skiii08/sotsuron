","I've never seen a movie where i felt more like a 'fly on the wall'. Great movie, acting. Did not try to be political in any direction, just told it like it was. I remember September 11th like it was yesterday. I remember thinking after more and more bad news if it was ever going to stop. I just had a newborn a couple of days earlier and i remember my felling of gathering my family together in a effort to protect them. I also remember how weird i felt the first time I came near a person (family) of middle eastern decent. I was at Moody Gardens in Galvetson, Texas and we were in a small room with several people looking into a Aquarium. A middle east family walked in and you could hear a pin drop. I hope we never go through this again and i'm afraid if we do it will be much worse.",9,2,8,29 April 2006
