Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh, I forgot....
","I have already added my comment to the currently 1670. But, I thought after reading some of the other comments on the movie I decided to add yet another one. Some people, like myself, have complained somewhat on the lack of  'life' in the characters in the movie. I want to recommend a sci-fi movie that has good acting, humour (in combination with sci-fi!), some stunning effects, etc; go and see or rent on video Besson's 'The Fifth Element'. It has a story, tension, and so on...Saying that, I still think Episode I is worth seeing despite my mild disapointment..... (See my previous comment...)",3,0,1,22 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good movie, but it breaks the 'Star Wars' magic
","In general I liked the new addition to the series of Star Wars movies. I think it some awsome scenes, special effects, and I think Mr. Lucas has quite succeeded in getting some environmental shots just right.
Not to mention the pod race. Great! Also some battle scenes where just great. When it comes to the characters, hmmmm, I think there could be some more done. Specially Obi-Wan. Who is he really? Anakin's mom (Pernilla August) didn't seem that sorry when Anakin was about to leave her. I do not think those scenes where that convincing. ** Warning.... real spoiler coming up... **Now, talking (writing!) about characters, I think we could have done better without that Jar-Jar dude. He does not fit into the 'Star Wars' theme at all. There was no story build up, we where thrown straight into the action! Just the rolling text in the beginning did not give the right feeling....
I think the audience where entitled to have more of the relationships between certain characters 'explained', like Obi-Wan and his superior. Who are the Siths? Why are they so dangerous? No mythical data to be presented somewhere in the movie? What is their relationship with the Jedis? We get to know that they should have been gone for over thousand years, but weren't.
That biological scientific explanation of the 'Force'??!!? It destroyed the magic that was built up since the very first film.... Oh no Mr. Lucas! You've spoiled it now! Finally (I'll stop now...) in general it was to much of a 'Family' movie. The previous releases have been far more 'serious', and that is the way I think it should be.",3,0,1,22 August 1999
