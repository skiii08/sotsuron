The Equalizer," Mostly atmosphere, zero story
","At the end of it all, I found this movie very boring. The story is old as dirt. The plot is so obvious that as soon as characters appear on screen one can identify, 'He'll be killed,' 'She'll be kidnapped and used as bait,' 'Something bad's gonna happen to him,' and my all-time favorite, 'He's the innocent, likable guy introduced early then ignored for 90 minutes (so we'll forget about him), only to have him turn up as a hostage in the big showdown.' And every prediction is spot-on.Example of bad writing: Two thugs walking up to a door. The last thing Thug 2 says to Thug 1 as they approach the door, 'Whatever you do, don't call him Little John.' Very next shot, inside the door, Thug 1 starts talking smack... and guess what he does? When the setup is literally 5 seconds earlier, we all see it coming. Give us the setup in a different location, maybe? Or at least disguise the setup amidst a longer, funny/entertaining conversation? Nope, just lay out that one line setup, then walk on in. We the viewers will just deal with it.Denzel's character is likable. I mean, insanely likable. Beyond the depth of my willful suspension of disbelief likable. He's always friendly, always in a good mood, always smiling. He's ecstatic just to be alive. Everyone loves being near him. He's never 'just a guy.' He's more helpful than a college professor, more inspirational than a priest, more motivational that a fitness instructor. Every scene in his workplace (which is visited repeatedly throughout the movie) includes no less than 2 background guys smiling giddily when Denzel arrives to work, and laughing loud at every word Denzel speaks. Going to work at Home Depot - sorry, 'Home Mart' - surely isn't like that in real life.But there's more to Denzel, isn't there? Who is this guy? Where'd he come from? Who knows? We'll never know. But clearly he's bad-ass. More moves than Shakira and deadlier than Seal Team Six. He seems to know how to handle any situation and any number of attackers - just because. No reason; he's just awesome. If you ever saw the classic comedy PLANET TERROR, just think of the scene, 'Give him the gun. Give him all the guns.' Because, ya know, he's just so bad-ass for no logical reason.The bad guy was awesome. While Denzel's fight scenes were a lot of super-close blurry shots, the few scenes where the Bad Guy establishes his badness were rather good, very tense, very violent and cringe-worthy.THE EQUALIZER has all latest bells and whistles with music, atmosphere, and build-up. The one female lead is developed nicely (especially compared to every other innocent victim who may as well have stepped out of Little House On The Prairie). Much of the movie is very tense, and keeps you hanging on to each scene, waiting to see what happens next. But ultimately, we all know Denzel will kick ass, so it's all just a waiting game. It felt very long. The wait is made so much worse when the viewer knows exactly what's coming. There's just no surprises here. You've seen this movie 500 times, I'm sure.Oh yeah, and Denzel knows everything. He appears magically inside buildings and rooms where one shouldn't be able to sneak in. He has cell phone numbers one shouldn't have access to - the characters even comment on it, 'How the hell did you get that number?!' No answer. Doesn't matter. It's a movie. Just turn off your brain and enjoy the tension building. How does Denzel know when the bad guys will appear at a time and place, so he can intercept them in the night? Don't know, doesn't matter, I guess. How does Denzel sneak into a closet-sized room without the occupant noticing? How does Denzel have time to set up his trap, rig wires, etc, without anyone seeing this work being done? Who cares, the resulting deaths are cool.Go to sleep. Tune out. Enjoy. But don't expect to take this movie with you. You'll have forgotten it by the time you leave the parking lot.",6,179,282,5 October 2014
Source Code," Sci-Fi action does not disappoint!
","Source Code is now added to my top 20 all-time favorite movies.This movie is excellent - if you like sci-fi. If you don't like science fiction, then this movie can't help you. You must be able to take a leap of faith with the premise of this story.Why this movie is fantastic and deserves your time: 1) Quick-start. The action begins the moment we fade-in. The very first frame of the movie - that's it, game on. And don't think this is the typical gimmick of then going into flashback so we can see the 'setup' for the action which started the story. Oh no. We simply jump into the middle of the action. The story has already started, and we're barely grabbing on for the ride.2) Pacing. The hero does everything you want him to do, exactly when you want it, in the right way, at the right time. Sometimes confused, sometimes determined and forceful - always in the same frame of mind as us, the viewers. At no time was I waiting for the hero to 'catch up' to me. And at no time was I left behind while the story raced ahead of me. It's a writing skill I greatly admire.3) Characters. They are all believable. They react to situations the way you think people should react. You never 'see' acting. You never say to yourself, 'Oh come on, nobody would say that.' Not in this movie.My mind was engaged every step of the way through this thriller. There's no time to rest. And there's no filler scenes.This movie has been compared to many. Source Code really stands out on its own, and is superior to most. If you liked or even mildly enjoyed some of the other movies to which Source Code has been compared, you should love this. Enjoy.",10,2,4,30 July 2011
Iron Man 2," Nearly as good as original
","I liked the movie enough. Aside from feeling burned by my theater's new $11 ticket price, ouch, I had a good time. But I give most credit to the audience with whom I watched this movie at 12:01am on the eve of the opening. The theater was quite full and those people are fanatic, laughing louder and making more whooping noises, clapping often, at stuff that most audiences would let pass in silence.The story was a bit simple, incomplete. Left me really unsatisfied. But if you want all the same stuff from the original: Tony Stark's ego, hot chick diversions, an evil dude and some government red tape as antagonists, then this basic rehash of the original is good for you.",6,0,3,7 May 2010
Two for the Money," Pretty boring, barely entertaining
","This movie wants to be Boiler Room, or something like it. Two For The Money has some greedy characters who are quick to bend the rules and break the law to get ahead of the guy next to them. And, like Boiler Room, we're given a glimpse into the life of one 'victim' of their efforts. And like Boiler Room, we're given a peak into the seedy underworld of a gray-market business that we otherwise would never see.But this movie does not measure up to Boiler Room. I wished I was watching Boiler Room again.Two For The Money just falls short. Al Pacino's acting is the same as any movie in which you've seen him. Every 5th or 6th scene affords Pacino his typical diatribe with a room full of people listening. All stuff you've seen before.And all the scenes of this movie are pretty random. There's hardly a story here to care about. Every scene could have been cropped out and placed anywhere back in the film, in random order, and it wouldn't make any difference.Wait for it to appear on TV.",5,0,2,12 October 2005
Ted," AWESOME comedy!
","I immediately voted this a 9-star. But a day later, I've upped my opinion to full 10-stars. I cannot think of a way to improve TED. It was simply hilarious.As you might suspect, there's a lot of stupid humor in TED. When I saw the dumb jokes coming, I would mentally prepare myself to simply hold my breath until it was over, knowing that more intelligent humor would follow. But more often than I care to admit, the 'dumb' humor wore me down until I burst out laughing like I haven't laughed at a movie since PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES or FAMILY VACATION. In my opinion, TED is an instant classic like those movies.Sure, TED is offensive and gross. But it's freakin' funny.I heard the 'FAMILY GUY' connection only *after* seeing the movie. I had no idea who Seth MacFarlane was, nor this movie's relationship to FAMILY GUY. Full disclosure: I cannot stand Family Guy. I tried watching it long ago, like three times. Each time I lasted about two minutes and had to turn it off. Just terrible. But TED is hilarious. So if you hate Family Guy, that doesn't necessarily mean you won't laugh at TED.There are lines, entire scenes, and facial expressions re-running through my head all day today.Full-stars, thumbs up, all that. If you can stand some foul language, and foul jokes, and you enjoy cultural references (going back to 1980), then run, do not walk, to see TED.",10,3,11,7 July 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," See it for the CGI
","I heard this movie sucked, so I had low expectations. That helped.I went for the CGI and I got what I hoped for. A good laughable popcorn flick. The CGI was awesome! Better than most I've seen (not all dark, not fake looking).The Quaid story really sucked. Be prepared.The whole story is told with an optimistic, happy, we-love-life and we-love-our-fellow-man attitude that was just boring, unrealistic, and stupid. There were no riots, no wars, and no blood. No one ever even cried. Considering that probably millions of people die in the story, it was told with such optimism that you just couldn't take it seriously.My friend and I whispered to each other and laughed throughout -- you should plan to do the same.The story is of the made-for-cable caliber (like the USA network, maybe), but the big-screen is worthy of the CGI. Aim for a matinee if you can.",5,0,1,31 May 2004
Spider-Man 3," Decent action flick, but the weakest of the trilogy. Wait for video.
","First let me say that I'm a big fan of the review written by this guy: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur15235922/comments I agree with every word he wrote. In fact, I liked his review better than I liked the movie.I really *wanted* to enjoy this movie. You have to truly *want* to enjoy in order to like it at all. I left the theater feeling slightly entertained, but only because I strongly yearned for it.The movie is weak from beginning to end. It has all the parts needed for a great action flick, but with no continuity. All the separate scenes felt disjointed and slopped together. The characters go through changes almost at random, every 5 minutes. Peter Parker's comic change in the middle of the movie was over the top, but it worked for me. It was meant to be comical and it was. The rest of his emotions were almost ridiculous. Every time he cried the opening-night audience around me laughed hysterically.I won't ruin the ending. I don't need to. Just think, 'cliche' and you already know the ending. The movie was drowning in sappy emotion towards the end. I can just imagine the writers of this script sitting around saying to each other, 'Everyone does movies with non-stop action til the end. Let's deliver a real message.' I choked on that message as it was crammed down my throat.And in the end, they finished off with even more sappy emotion which left me totally unsatisfied. No uplifting joy at the end of this movie. Even as the credits rolled, it was a soft, slow, almost depressing music that played.All around, just BLAH. Wait for the DVD rental.",6,1,1,6 May 2007
Man of Steel," Clear your mind of the past 75 years, and you can enjoy this SUPERMAN
","I owe much thanks to another IMDb review that stated essentially that - just forget everything you know about the Superman story, and you can enjoy this movie.It was impossible for me not to draw parallels with Christopher Reeve's 1977 Superman. This story is certainly based on the history of Superman we all know. But it's been modernized - big time. So just brace yourself for this update, and you can enjoy this story.The number of coincidences in the plot were annoying. Sometimes inconvenient loose ends are simply dropped and ignored (but try as I might, I couldn't forget them). And the shaky cam, while improved here, in my opinion, was still overused and over-the-top.Unlike the 1977 movie where Reeves follows a straight path from Krypton, to farm boy, to hero, this Superman meanders. He struggles to figure out where to go, how to live his life, etc. I think this is why other reviews call the story line a 'mess.' But it's intentional. He's an outcast, in hiding, without an instruction manual. So his story is directionless and confused, for a long time. That's the real story arc of this movie. It's Clark Kent figuring out - what next? I was thoroughly entertained, thanks to the warning to clear my mind of expectations.",10,6,12,30 June 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," pretty damn good
","Most important: it does NOT ruin the series!I loved it.The beginning was Terminator trite -- 1 terminator appears, the 2nd appears, he has to get clothes.  We've seen it all in the 1st 2 movies.  But after that it really took off on its own.The use of special effects was great.  There was SOME useless 'shaky cam' shots thrown in there.  But mostly, the fight scenes and chase scenes were epic.I expected to see Arnold, the Terminator, chasing John with a walker. He's not young anymore.  But he's still got 'it.'Most important for me, I felt like the story progressed.  This isn't just another 1 of 20 sequels they'll make.  In T3, the story actually moves forward.  So if -- IF -- they do make a T4, it'll have to 'move on' from here.  I was pleased with that.Be warned: Arnold has more than his share of silly one-liners.  This one is definately more light-hearted than the previous movies.I give it 9/10 -- maybe even 10/10.",9,0,0,3 July 2003
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Too bad about the trailer
","This really was a very good movie. But the trailer ruined it.This movie is more like a drama, with a very action-packed ending. The entire ending (all the action) is shown in the trailer. So the whole time watching this movie I was left wondering, 'When is this going to happen? When is that going to happen?' Every exciting twist and turn shows up in the trailer, so I found myself watching just for the imagery, but always knowing what was coming next.Some characters are absolute cookie-cutter and their story arcs can be foreseen instantly and accurately.I would have given this an 8, but knowing the entire plot from beginning to end really detracted from my enjoyment. So I downgrade this to a 7.",8,3,6,10 August 2011
Cars," Animation: Cars, Humor: Over The Hedge
","'Cars' has the best animation I've seen yet. From scene to scene it fluctuated between literally unbelievable and just really good. The first 20 minutes were, by far, the best animation -- truly astounding.By the way, I'm 37 and went with another 30-something friend. No kids.But I was disappointed in the humor. I never laughed out loud. It was a cute story with the usual 'message' at the end. It was surprisingly long at nearly 2 hours.For sheer laughs, I much more enjoyed 'Over The Hedge.' It was faster, and laugh-out-loud funny. 'Cars,' being the hyped animated movie of the summer, was a bit of a let-down.At the end of the movie, I just wished I could watch the 1st 20 minutes over again. I wished they'd used the best animation at the end rather than the beginning.But I'm being harsh. Over all, it was enjoyable. But don't buy into the hype and don't expect it to be as funny as 'Over The Hedge.'",6,6,12,17 June 2006
2012," Very pleasantly surprised!
","Just left the theater. I'm really on a post-great-apocalyptic-movie high right now. I mean, like Bruce Willis in Armageddon type of high. This movie was awesome.Maybe I was easily pleased because all the negative reviews here (and dismal 6.2 rating) got my hopes down. That may have helped. But this movie had all the big effects and action you hope for and expect.Also, kudos to the producers and advertising team for not ruining every twist of the movie. Sure, the ads showed a fair bit of the action, but not everything. There were cameos, good one-liners, action shots and pay-off shots all *not* revealed in trailers. Good stuff.When our viewing ended, the audience applauded the movie. We were pleased. 9 stars from me.",9,2,8,12 December 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," It was okay! Not as bad as they say!
","** MINOR spoilers **No, it's not nearly as bad as people claim.I saw this opening night (well, Friday). The theater was packed. There weren't many ooh's and ahhh's as one would hope on opening night. The theater was a bit quiet, marked by only a few chuckles. But I still felt entertained.Mind you, I despised the 2nd X-Men movie. So my expectations were lowered here.I understand the complaints about the introduction of so many new mutants and the number of previous characters who were dismissed. But I really thought they were merely responding to so many fans' complaints from the first 2 movies. All I ever heard was, 'Aww, where's this character?' and 'What about so-and-so?!' Well, here in the 3rd movie, you certainly cannot say that! And for me, having never read the comic, I liked the new (new to me anyways) characters.True, the Phoenix didn't have much to do. But there was plenty of other action on the screen to keep me happy. And the characters were not developed at all. True. But that's the price you pay, folks, for having all your precious mutants in one movie! I seriously doubt this is the last X-Men movie. With the way they've introduced so many new characters -- particularly young kids -- and removed older characters, this franchise can live on for a long time. And if you stay until the very end of the credits, you'll see they have certainly left themselves room for a sequel.I was disappointed in some scenes where the special FX lacked. But there were other scenes that truly delivered, so I quickly forgave the shortcomings. My only real complaint -- with all the movies, not just this one -- is that every human is a bad-guy. I suspect, in the real world, people would be hoping-to-God for a mutant child, because everyone want's their child to be special, to stand out, to be unique. And oftentimes the mutants (the X-Men) help the humans. They've talked to the President (X-Men 2) and have protected humans with their powers. Stories like these X-Men movies have plenty of room for interesting dialogue about human nature: prejudice, social class, etc. But they're all about action.Don't expect character development. Enjoy some good fight scenes. Have a chuckle or two. Overall, it's a so-so movie.So for you X-Men super-fans, maybe it sucked. For a guy who loved the first X-Men movie and likes to see action and special effects, it wasn't bad.Hope you enjoy it.",7,0,2,27 May 2006
Event Horizon," Tense, honestly scary sci-fi
","You want to be scared? This movie scared the bejeezus out of me. So much so I didn't watch it a 2nd time for eighteen years.This movie is just a wee bit rough around the edges. Some moments are filled with a tad over-acting, or over-writing, creating drama artificially. And one or two little nit-picks in the story don't keep up with today's technology. But they don't stop the story. Still, overall, this movie freaks me out. There are scenes so slow and brutally honest where I had to cover my eyes still.You want sci-fi horror? This is it. I'm surprised at the low rating.... well according to IMDb I cannot post a review with less than 10 lines. By my math the above review contains 12 lines. So I'll throw this on here to hopefully convince the bot. Still, this is an awesomely scary sci-fi movie which mostly holds up from the 1990s to today. Highly recommend if you've seen all the biggest blockbusters.",9,2,3,25 March 2015
Avatar," Overcoming my disdain for CGI
","When you stop caring, or even noticing, the CGI, you know you're watching a good movie.I generally hate CGI, especially in large doses. It's disheartening for me to watch a big screen knowing that every little detail is there because someone thought to draw it. Nothing accidental, nothing by chance, or dropped in by human quirk. But Avatar made me not care. And that's really saying something.I fell in love with the scenery! This movie was simply beautiful to look at.The story was 100% predictable. You know what the protagonist is going to do, every step of the way, and sometimes you have to wait a while for it. But who cares? It was great. When it ended, I don't know where 2-1/2+ hours went! I honestly didn't want it to end. I didn't want to leave that world.This is what the big screen is made for!",10,11,17,18 December 2009
In Time," Sad waste of a great concept
","IN TIME is not a complete waste of your time. It's just... so... disappointing. And it was really close to being good.The writing is just awful. I can't believe this was scripted by the same person who wrote GATTACA (one of my all-time top 5 favorites). Justin Timberlake is a good actor, but there's only so much that can be done when starting from poor dialogue. If IN TIME is your type of movie, but you were disappointed, try GATTACA.Terrible production. It's supposed to take place in a slum, but really felt sterile. Like a Dukes Of Hazzard episode shot on a Hollywood back lot. The streets were too clean, everything was too quiet and organized. Just throw in a couple bland extras in the background, have the cast say 'ghetto' a few times, and expect the audience to accept it.The storyline, particularly the last 30 minutes, was pretty much what I would've written for the ending - back when I was in the 7th grade.Unrealistic math. These people are living day-to-day - literally. It's just too close to believe. Some more thought into this really awesome concept could have saved the idea.So you start with a bad script, silly caricatures, sad dialogue, then direct the movie with no sense of excitement or tension, while not doing any production to give the movie the correct look and feel, and you have IN TIME, a neat idea, sadly disappointing. Just so close, but really forgettable.",6,0,0,13 March 2012
The Happening," So much better than the reviews it's received!
","This movie is NOT BAD! I had such incredibly low expectations after reading the reviews here on IMDb. I was hesitant to see this. But I have loved M. Night's other works, and I kinda like Wahlberg too. So I spent the dollar at RedBox to rent it. I just now finished watching The Happening.This movie is really worth watching! Of course, I really like sci-fi flicks, especially smart ones. I can't understand how this movie is rated to low? I can only guess that people want Bruce Willis or Will Smith to swoop in and blow up bad guys, or something equally lame.This movie is suspenseful, slow, and deliberate. What can I say, I liked it a lot. The few key characters introduced seemed like real people. I cared about them and wanted them to succeed and survive. Isn't that the most important thing in a movie? Several other reviews here on IMDb stated specifically that that first half of the movie was good, or even great, but that the second half fell apart or lost the audience. I kept watching, waiting for that moment where the story jumps the shark and suckiness ensues. Alas, no suck was to be found. I was in suspense til the end.The weak bits: The acting was spotty. There's a few scenes where the actor's timing appears off or perhaps are over-emotional for the moment. I blame that on editing, really. Also, this movie is very PG. Considering the horrors we are shown (or almost shown), I would expect a lot more cursing. The verbal cleanliness felt unnatural to me. But that's about it.Really, overall, decent film. I give it 9 out of 10 stars. Yay M. Night!",9,3,8,25 November 2008
War of the Worlds," Moral of the story: pure sci-fi action
","There's no slowing down for a love story or any deep intellectual meaning. This is an action flick and nothing else. The action started early and didn't stop. By the end I was exhausted. I felt I had been exercising for two hours. I had been tense and sweating. Very exciting!It was so good I could forgive a few minor blemishes. Dakota Fanning (great in this movie!) had one lousy line. Kids don't say grown-up things like 'That's not how you're going to get through to him.' But that was okay, and it was early in the movie.Tom Cruise did accomplish one super-human feat that I found unbelievable, but by that time, I didn't care. It was all good.Don't look for any morals here. Don't expect to learn anything about the human experience. Just be prepared to run.",10,16,35,30 June 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Did little for me
","For those who don't know, the TV show Dr. House, MD (or just 'House') is based on Sherlock Holmes and his friend Watson, with the characters renamed to House and Wilson.So, having been a fan of House, the TV show, for a long time, I'm growing bored with it. It's neat that the main character can solve medical mysteries and find cleverly hidden clues in people's lives. But I've grown so tired of watching that miserable person manipulate coworkers and meddle with people's lives. Then I watch the movie Sherlock Holmes. And it's the same stuff with which I'm already bored.So this movie had that going against it.Then the mystery was impossible. I mean, there's no need for the audience to even try to figure out anything in the movie, because it's all far too complicated for you to solve. Kinda defeats the purpose of a mystery movie.And then the story was haphazard. Each scene seemed to pop-up out of nowhere. There was no logical tie-in from one scene to the next. I'd bet you could take all the scenes, shuffle them in a Yatzee cup, and dump them out, letting them land where they may, and the movie would make about as much sense as it does now.Any good story - particularly where a mystery is being 'solved' - the audience should be right there with the main character, thinking ahead, knowing where we must search next. We should just barely predict the next location. But instead, it's all so random seeming.Other than that, I admit, RDJ's body was impressive. My lady friend enjoyed that part of the movie. But even for free, I'd never sit through this movie again.",3,20,39,30 December 2009
The Blind Side," Non-stop Hallmark card, you'll love every moment
","This movie was perfect. I loved it.It was completely predictable. I mean, every individual scene was predictable. And I always knew what the next scene would be. And eventually, there it would be, just as I expected. Nothing is surprising.But who cares? This movie really made me feel good from start to finish. I can sew why it ran and ran in theaters for so long. Sandra Bullock really earned that Oscar. She was great to watch.I was mildly annoyed that the Oher character (ya know, the main guy in the movie, and all) rarely put two words together. I know he's supposed to be simple, but I thought he must've talked more than that in real life.This is like a long Hallmark card. But it doesn't make you sick; you love every moment of it. A week later I'm still replaying scenes in my mind.",10,0,1,8 May 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Kni - ho-hum! yawn. excuse me - ight Rises
","The Dark Knight - it looked good. The music score was great. It had mood - lots and lots of mood. The antagonist stole the show every time he walked on screen. Bane looked and sounded good. Every time I was stuck watching someone else, I wished Bane would return just so I can listen to him talk (and yeah, you had to focus, at times, to understand him).They did a great job letting us know who was 'in on it.' One can easily see - and is often reminded, with great repetition - who knows Batman, who likes him, who distrusts him, etc.By my lord, what a boring movie. I just didn't care one bit about anything on the screen. I was rather begging for it to end. This one I should have saved for a $1 rental. But to be honest, if I watched this from my sofa, I would never, never stay away two and a half hours through this.My thoughts are with the families in Aurora, Colorado. I love the movies - particularly big-bang movies on the big screen. And I went to see The Dark Knight Rises partly out of sympathy and support for both the victims of that awful event, and also for the love of my summer pastime, movies on the big silver screen. So, you see where my heart is. I really wanted to like TDKR. But sorry, this movie was just plain boring.",4,3,9,25 July 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," Live Free Or Try Again. Entertaining but sooo overrated.
","I was really hoping for the great summer blockbuster, and thought this would be it. But I felt really disappointed the whole way through. And I walked out of the theater feeling like, 'Okay, how can I salvage what's left of my day?' This story -- and I use that term loosely -- is driven by this new style of bad guy that seems to popular in Hollywood these days. They are the omnipotent, omnipresent bad guy who see everything, know everything, and can do anything. So how can you battle them? How can our hero prevail? Oooohh wow, I can just envision the writers patting themselves on the back. It must seem so suspenseful! This omni-bad-guy has appeared in the last 10 Harrison Ford movies. You can't move without them knowing it; they've taken over your computer. Where do you turn? Eegad.Remember the first Die Hard? How do you get outside help with no phone? Puase for suspense. You pull the fire alarm, brilliant! Bruce Willis watches with glee as the red flashing lights of the fire trucks pierce the night and approach, no doubt soon followed by police cars. And we feel his agony when the red lights stop flashing and the trucks slow down and turn around. Now THAT was interesting! Here we have a lot of car crashes (I mean, A LOT). Think: Blues Brothers in Chicago car crashes. Only here it's supposed to be serious, but it's not; it's just silly. Consider this: if every traffic light in your town suddenly turned green at the same time, would every intersection involve a 60mph collision? I think not. Everything might grind to a halt, sure. But in Live Free Or Die Hard, all the lights turn green and all hell breaks loose (I haven't ruined anything -- that happens in the first 15 minutes).There is very little original here. And the leaps of faith needed for this flick require mental iron-man triathlete.Like so much other pulp shoved out the Hollywood meat-grinder nowadays, this movie LOOKED good, and had all the right ideas. But without a good story, with build-up, with drama, you just have flash after flash. There's no real REASON to care about these characters.I STRONGLY suggest you wait for the video and rent it. But no matter, you will flock like everyone else to spend your $10. Decently entertaining, but disappointing. Enter the theater with NO EXPECTATIONS and you might be entertained -- as your brain slowly shrinks a little more.",4,6,15,6 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," Storyless tripe.
","Storyless tripe.Action? Yes.  Great characters?  Mostly.  Good actors?  Yes.  Special FX? Yes!  Good plot?  Nope!The characters were already written, good special FX is a given, and the actors were already selected (in the 1st film).  The ONLY THING the makers of X2 had to do was write a good story.  And they failed.Yes, the movie was neat.  Only because: 1. We love the characters so damn much, we ache to re-visit them, and 2. The special FX are cool (the few times they were not filmed in the dark).For my $9.00 and the $1 Billion this junk will earn, I expect a good story.I want drama!  I want build-up!  This story SUCKED.  Anyone who disagrees with me has never read a good book.  Nor seen a good movie for that matter.Non-stop action does not make a good movie!  An explosion is NOT exciting. WAITING for an explosion, especially one that never comes, IS exciting.From the previews, you already know that Magneto escapes and that the school is attacked.  THAT alone could've been the entire movie -- if they built up to it.  Instead, both things happen extremely early and rather abruptly. No build-up, no suspense.  It's over.  Unfortunately, the movie went on.The music score of the first film was wonderful.  It resonates in my mind even now.  The music in this movie is just background mush.  Why?!  Oh why did they change it?!  What?  Were the royalties too high?  If you've seen this heap o' crap, try to think of the musical score.  Just try.  Can't even hear it, can you?  It was background garbage!If you rated rated this pile of dung 8 stars or higher, let me just say this: you are easily fooled and easily entertained.  Go home and watch MTV.Good story-telling vs Bad story-telling:X-Men 1: We SEE Magneto in the concentration camp as a young boy, and we immediately understand his purpose and feelings throughout the film. GOOD story-telling.X-Men 2: We are introduced to Stryker via a CONVERSATION between Magneto and the Professor. They say things like, 'Remember Stryker?' and 'Wasn't his son a student of yours?' and then 'Wasn't he pissed at you because of this?' and then 'he's in the military, remember?' and then 'he's behind all this and he's coming to get us.'Yeeeup.  That's how we learn about Stryker.  Man, is that GREAT story telling or what?  Watching the two heroes have a conversation about him. Anyone who's ever read a good book will recognize amateur hour when they see it.  Or in this case, Amateur 2 Hours plus commercials and previews.THIS STORY SUCKED.Think I'm being picky?  Okay, here's some details (and SPOILERS):Wasn't that jet supposed to be 'super?'The 'super' jet is suddenly detectable by radar?  And can't outfly ordinary Air Force Jets?  And is simply shot out of the sky by typical air-to-air missiles?What happened to the 'fantastic' jet in the 1st film.  At that time, they simply said, 'If they have anything that can track us, they deserve to catch us.'  What happened to that wonderful weapon?Forget it; it's gone!  Any poor writer given the task of creating a future X-Men story will have to do without it.  what's the point?  They can't fly anywhere if the American military can chase them down, and shoot them down, and even know that it's under the basketball court at the school!Why would Cyclops SO suddenly stop attacking?  He was brainwashed, but 3 seconds later he's normal?  It's like watching Knight Rider get knocked on the head and get amnesia.  Remember that?  And 55 minutes later he gets hit on the head again and he's normal, remember?I'm not even joking here.  One second he's trying to kill his own wife, and LITERALLY 2 seconds later he's crying, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I was brainwashed!'Yeah, the writing in this movie was about that good.Why fight when you're brainwashed?Think of someone trying to write X3 or X4.  What kind of plot can they have? In this movie, it's established that the humans have the ability to brainwash any mutant.  This was stressed so much that the human Stryker even had a mutant slave!Now, imagine yourself watching ANY future X-Men movie.  Whenever a mutant and human exit a room together, you'll have to ask yourself, 'Why didn't that human just brainwash him?'  Really?  Game over.  No story to tell at all.Stryker: the omni-present bad guy.In X2, Stryker appears in nearly EVERY DAMN scene.  Watch this:1. He's in the Oval Office, 2. He's talking to politicians in the hallway, 3. He's in the plastic prison with Magneto, 4. He's attacking the school with the G-men, 5. He has a nice conversation with Wolverine, 6. He's there to greet his POW, Patrick Stewart, 7. He's in the fort, watching Wolverine approach on screen, 8. He's in nearly every shot in the finale, in the fort, 9. He's even OUTSIDE the fort, conveniently, when Wolverine comes back out! 10, But wait!  There's more!  He's still outside waiting to have a conversation with Magneto a few minutes later! 11. He's still outside one last time to talk to Wolverine again!And I'm sure I've forgotten a crappy scene or two.  He was everywhere!Remember that thing they had in the 1st film?  It was so cool.  That thing where Rogue was talking to Wolverine, as the characters were introduced to the audience.  It was there when we watched Wolverine discover the school and walk the halls for the 1st time.  That was called suspense!Having been warned about the crapola story, you can sit and watch this vomit and enjoy some action scenes.  They're okay.  But this movie is only mediocre.The well-trained lab rats who gleefully stand in line to give these people their $100 Million per weekend just make me sick.5 outa 10.  That's ONLY for the special FX.",4,0,0,12 May 2003
Easy A," Suckered by promising trailer :(
","I wanted to like this movie. It was a good concept, but it just failed for me. Without spoiling any storyline, here's just some stuff I could not get past: 1) When a movie starts with a character narration, that's just bad writing. Lazy. SHOW us, don't TELL us. That's Creative Writing 101, high school level. And the narration just never stopped. It was like listening to an audio book.2) Everyone was just so overly quirky and funny. The main character, of course. But also her teachers, her parents especially, her friends and her enemies. All of them talked at an inhumanly fast and witty speed - like Robin Williams in the 1980s. It could be cute for a minute, or even for a whole scene, but the entire movie was just unbelievable.3) While I'm accustomed to 20-something actors playing high school students, in this case, I was really distracted by the actors' obvious ages. For the first 15 minutes of the movie I thought they were in community college. Once I realized it was high school, I couldn't ignore how old they all looked.4) Good storyline parts were abandoned. Sad face :( I won't ruin which parts.It was a good idea for a story. Nearly there, had potential. But just flopped for anyone over 16 years of age. And mostly, I just wished the narration would shut up.",2,21,39,17 September 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Major disappointment -- does not live up
","Shaky-Cam: For the love of God, Hollywood, stop it. Just stop. Matt Damon need not be in most of this movie, you couldn't see any of the action anyway. A shaky camera does not make a good movie; it cheats you out of the action. The sooner movie-goers learn this and stop watching, the sooner Hollywood will get off its lazy rump and go back to a thing called 'choreography.'One reviewer said this movie had 'the best car chase scene.' My god, are you kidding? You hardly could see the cars thru the blurry shaking!Omni-Presence: Jason Bourne, in this sequel, has the ability to appear anywhere, at any time, without effort. He is God-like in that respect. He's not human, he can't be slowed down. This is not entertaining. It's boring. I tried my best to keep up with (what passes for a) story, but Matt Damon just kept popping up next to, behind, on top of the other people so fast, I couldn't follow it. He was super-human, apparently. It was too much; it's not entertaining.There was no drama, no anticipation, no suspense. Bad Hollywood, lazy writer! Bad.I'll watch the 1st movie again 100 times (and I have) before sitting thru this crap again.3/10 for me.",6,0,1,31 July 2004
The Island," Surprisingly not sucky
","Back when THE ISLAND was in theaters, I saw the trailers and thought little of it. Most notably, I thought the trailer ruined the whole movie (which I hate hate hate).Much, much later I finally watch it on download. Not bad! Yeah, the story is simple and obvious. Viewers won't likely be surprised by anything. But this is mindless, action-packed fun. Glitzy high-speed chases, beautiful people (oohhhh Scarlett!).The movie was a bit too long. Would've been better about 20 minutes shorter. But generally entertaining, not nearly the crap I had expected.And yes, the subject matter of this movie has been done before, been done better. Watch MOON, for example.",6,0,1,11 September 2011
