Mission: Impossible III," Best MI movie till now
","I got a chance to see the premier last evening, when it was being shown to the whole cast and selected persons only. The movie began slowly, i'd say the first 15-20 minutes might be boring. But then the main action began. The acting is superb to say the least and i reckon it might be tom cruise'es best acting performance. The plot though i thought lacked sense (u'll see why), but i guess the action sequences cover that up. I don't think the movie has disappointed me at all, and i think most people will like it owing to the amazing action sequences and great acting. But still the writers have to do a better job, and i hope to see MI:4 soon!",7,15,30,1 May 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Really good
","They are back and now there are 13...The movie is any day better than ocean's twelve (which i think was really bad) but still not as good as the original! All of them are back and why not with such an amazing director and support group who wouldn't come back. Al Pacino is fantastic as always and adds that extra bit to the movie.Story is actually at par with the first one and 20 times better than the second movie! Got to see an early screening and loved it. I don't want to spoil the movie. But one thing is true that the story is again complicated and its for the better only as the more complicated the better. Acting as always amazing.After disappointments of spider-man 3, shrek 3 and to some extent POC 3, this one s easily better than the above three and thus this is a must watch 9/10",9,168,319,27 May 2007
Saw III," Beats the previous ones
","Well, after watching Saw 1 i was really looking forward to Saw 2, which as far as i am concerned wasn't as good as Saw 1 and my hopes for Saw 3 went down, but last night i got a free pass from my friend for an advance private screening of Saw 3.I can promise you one thing this movie is just like Saw 1 and has everything and loads more of gore than Saw 1 & 2.The acting particularly is good, but its the story and the plot that is extremely well written and of course the Twists again like the first 2 are huge and much much much much more enthralling and shocking! This movie is a reminder of Saw 1 and really sets the tone for more Saw movies to come i would be heartbroken if this Saw series ends here because its getting interesting with each part.Thumbs up to Saw 3, a must see, go and watch it and experience the shocks! 8/10",10,315,579,26 October 2006
Saw II," Couldn't have been better!
","Well, saw2 does surely beat saw specially for all those who loved saw. I mean this time the plot gets more intense with identity of the jigsaw killer known there is a sense of tension among the viewers of what he'll do next. But with all do respect................one thing if i may point out is , due to more people in this movie as in the 8 people in the room...........it might confuse.......because we don't know much about the characters. But then the jigsaw killers games are so sick , inventive and bloody the viewer forgets about character development. All in all i guess everyone who liked saw(of course), Mindhunters(good thriller) , scream , and all such movies involving a mixture of suspense and horror which gets the viewers thinking will surely love this movie.

Casino Royale," Daniel Craig you are here to stay!
","This is among the best bond movies! You have to see it. After all the controversy and comments on Daniel Craig's potential as an actor and doubts over him playing Bond...i'd say forget it and be enthralled by the new BOND! He's here to stay.He has that natural feeling about him when you see him on the screen as Bond, that attitude, style, confidence matched only by Sean COnnery. The movie as a whole is extremely entertaining and exciting.The acting is awesome Eva Green actually does a great job and has really improved her acting from the last time i saw her (in kingdom of heaven), but then this is a totally different movie.There's a lot of action mixed with great story which i am sure will please the true Bond fan.Please go and watch this because you will regret if you don't, forget the past this is the New Bond.9/10",9,761,1123,12 November 2006
