The Devil's Advocate," Half an idea is underdeveloped as Hollywood takes the easy way out
","In an odd sort of way, The Devil's Advocate typifies what is wrong with so much Hollywood film-making today. To put it simply, there is just far, far less to it than meets the eye. Ostensibly it has so much going for it: Al Pacino, most certainly, and then Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, who as actors are both well the good side of mediocre. Reeves,especially, is far better than his reputation as a brainless, though good-looking, piece of meat would suggest. The are other things about this film which are not half bad: the central conceit of the Devil (some of us still feel that old bounder deserves an upper-case D) operating on Earth as a lawyer had potential, insulting though it is to your common or garden lawyer. Then there are the nuts and bolts of film-making. It is handsomely made, with the expected expensive Hollywood production values, and the early scenes 혰 for example, of Reeves in court where his ambition take second place to his scruples and integrity, and later where Pacino's Devil tempts Reeves to throw in his lot with his hotshot law firm 혰 are promising, and you are intrigued just how it is all going to pan out. The scene at Pacino's 'office' at the top of a New York skyscraper complete with what seems to be a small lake in the sky is rather good (and recalls, as it is supposed to, the temptation of Christ). Yet finally that is pretty much it. Characters aren't developed and there is no discernible storyline. The first hint that the hotshot law firm might not be all it seems is when Theron, the young lawyer's wife finding her feet in uptown Manhattan thinks the sees the face of her new friend briefly morph into that of a monster. But this isn't really followed up, either, and exactly why Theron should so suddenly crack up, more or less overnight, is raped by Pacino and finally cuts her own throat are never explained. What the Devil is up to masquerading as a the very rich boss and owner of a Manhattan law firm is also left unexplained. At one point there are vague references to all the evil in the world and how Pacino's firm represents the interest of arms dealers etc etc but this is done in such a throwaway fashion that it is hard to escape the conviction that the target market for this hokum are the Western world's morons. This is lazy film-making at its laziest. Characters and ideas 혰 or rather 'idea' 혰 are simply left undeveloped and any exposition of the central theme of evil in the world and how it flourishes because man's vanity and a lack of a moral compass is not just two-dimensional but one-dimensional. Too much about this film is strip-cartoon like and every last single element of its potential is wasted. After a very promising start it gradually dawns on the viewer that there is simply no point this film. It is not frightening, there's no horror, there is no thought, there is no development and there is no tension. It doesn't hang together and what ideas there are are simply thrown in to flatter those who might think they have half a brain. If they think that this film is in anyway good, then they will have all the proof they need that they don't. The very final scene is very odd indeed and would more naturally belong to a comedy, but nothing which has proceeded that scene would ever make you believe the film is intended as a comedy. Finally, the way the central idea and its potential are wasted is a great shame because Pacino (who never gives a bad performance, not even in downmarket nonsense like this), Reeves (who suggests there is quite a large acting talent there which still largely remain untapped) and Theron (who does rather well despite a hammy script) are rather good.",2,14,34,1 May 2008
Moneyball," Dull as ditchwater if you don't know baseball (and quite possibly equally as dull if you do)
","I'm a Brit and know b*gger all about baseball. Perhaps that's why I found this film to be duller than watching paint dry. On the other hand even if you know about baseball, you might also find this film dull, dull, dull.I like Brad Pitt and have enjoyed many of his films. I find he always brings a certain something to every role he plays, and he brought it to this one, too. Sadly, it wasn't enough to save this film.When I wasn't baffled by all the baseball talk, I was bored. And even when I wasn't baffled by all the baseball talk - there were one or two jargon-free scenes - I was still bored. To be frank, I considered switching off and writing this review halfway through, but I persevered. Well, I know think I need not have bothered: the review would have been the same.If you think you might like this, by all means give it a whirl, but don't blame me if you don't and like me feel bored out of your tiny mind. Gets a five because it isn't exactly bad, but that's it.",5,0,3,18 February 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Perhaps a tad baffling to be really great
","Several claims have been made about Blade Runner 2049, including one in review that appeared in the UK's Guardian, that it is destined to become a future 'sci-fi classic'.Other reviewers suggest that in some kind of profound way the film examines what it is to be human (or something). Both claims might well be true: but either way, the film does go on for quite some time and almost - almost - overstays its welcome. As for 'being profound', well, if that's another way of saying the film occasionally gets close to being a little baffling, so be it.Oddly, I never saw the first Blade Runner all the way through - I always grew a little bored and doing something else seemed a little more attractive, but I understand that first film is now a 'sci-fi classic'. Perhaps, but by my own admission, I'm in no position to say yay or nay.As for Blade Runner 2049, I can see how some might like to make the claim, but as for being profound and some kind of ontological examination of both humanity and whatever '-ity' droids will claim for themselves, the jury is still out and won't be back for a while.Even if the production company's publicity department had thought of describing the film as such, it will surely soon have been obvious to them that they would run the risk of alienating all those fans who like their words to have no more than two syllables.
 Visually, Blade Runner 2049 is magnificent, so it is a shame that the storyline - 'plot' is a little too mundane for a 'sci-fi classic' - meanders rather more than a tale told by the local bar bore.It hooks into the first Blade Runner outing and in a somewhat convoluted way - I've already used the word 'baffling' so I'm attempting what is often called 'elegant variation' - doing so make sense. It's just that the sum of the parts doesn't quite add up to a satisfyingly coherent whole. You can admire each part, but drumming up total admiration for the whole is rather a challenge.I feel rather guilty being so apparently mean-spirited, but I have no choice. Blade Runner 2049 is a well-made, well-acted, well-directed and well-produced film, but doesn't quite pay the full shilling. Go for it and make your own mind up. Who knows, you might even decide that I'm talking cobblers. Or perhaps not.",6,2,3,21 June 2018
Vertigo," Best film of all time (as of yesterday)? Er, not quite, more Hitchcock once again doing his schtick (which is OK, but this is no masterpiece)
","It's Thursday, August 2, 2012, and as of yesterday until it, too, is knocked off its perch, Hitchcock's Vertigo has been declared by the saintly cineastes around the world to whose apparently impeccable taste and judgment we are bound to bow as 'the greatest movie of all time'. Well, all I can say, is 'up to a point, Lord Copper'. The film it dislodged was Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, another 'masterpiece' which was also entertaining enough but . . . But then who am I do disagree, especially as others here use such superlatives as 'masterpiece', 'excellent' and 'perfect'?However, disagree I do, with those verdicts and the judgment of that pantheon of cinema's saints about Vertigo and Citizen Kane. It's pertinent that I find the kind of 'rich list' mentality which always wants a top of the pops a tad tacky and infantile, but that in itself would be no reason to criticise Vertigo. One bod pontificating on the radio yesterday (Nick James, the editor of Sight & Sound it was) admitted that on its release Vertigo was not especially popular with the critics who found the plot not just overwrought but downright ludicrous. But, he added, it has found greater recognition and popularity 54 years on because 'it has more to do with our inner lives (than Citizen Kane) and we're more interested in our inner lives than we have been for a while'. Give me a break.For this viewer Vertigo is entertaining enough but has dated badly. It is shot through with the kind of cod psychology which was so popular with Fifties folk, and its style is still very rooted in the kind of melodrama which defined cinema when a young Alfred Hitchcock was learning his trade in the Twenties and early Thirties. And, yes, the plot is still ludicrous. That, of course, need not be a bad thing, but a director attempting something similar today would surely attempt a far more nuanced approach and use a scalpel to pare away at his or her material rather than the hammer and chisel Hitchcock employs.In fact, were a director able to pull it off today, he would ensure that at first, second and third blush we would not even realise quite how ludicrous the plot is. Here's an example of quite how much Vertigo is not a masterpiece: Barbara Bel Geddes plays a character, a friend of Stewart's, who is in love with him, but is only in the film 1) to set the hare rolling by giving us Stewart's story in one of the opening scenes 2) acting as a red herring. She appears twice more, once in a very odd scene in which she tries - in a quite bizarre way - to show him she loves him, and then when Stewart is in the looney bin for six months after having a nightmare.Most crucially, in that opening scene there are not one but two shots, both close-ups of Bel Geddes face, which apparently convey that: take note, there're more to this character than meets the eye. In fact, both shots and their spurious significance are irrelevant. After the character has appeared several times to serve Hitchock's purpose - well, forget the Barbara Bel Geddes character: Hitchcock has no more use for her and we never see her again. Masterpiece? Cineastes - I would prefer to put the word in inverted commas as in 'cineastes' - who often like to lord it over us given their superior knowledge of 'film history' and like nothing better than to have a valhalla of director heroes might well argue that 'introducing' the Barbara Bel Geddes character helps 'build up the suspense' and is Hitchcock 'at his most masterful'. Not really - sloppy scriptwriting would be more to the point.So there you have it. I'm giving this a 5 out of 10 because it does the biz in Hitchcock's own way, but treat it and its special effects more as an historical artefact than 'the greatest movie of all time'. For a far better Hitchcock film, track down Lifeboat (with a screenplay by John Steinbeck).Oh, and I've always fancied Kim Novak, and still do. That earned this film one more point than I thought it deserved.",5,6,13,2 August 2012
Lucky Number Slevin," Gets a 7, but grudgingly - read on to find out why
","I first saw the trailer to Lucky Number Slevin and was intrigued enough to watch the film itself. In many ways that trailer suggested the film was a 'comedy/drama' (as those who like to categorise would have put it) and so does the first half of the film. After a rather bloody prologue which sees something like four or five gruesome murders, we are presented with another intriguing sequence which also concludes with a murder.None of the foregoing was particularly funny, but when we get to what seems to by the nub of the film, Scottish director Paul McGuigan does most certainly seem to be playing if for laughs: naïve chap turns up in New York to see a friend, and after the mugging to which all naïve young chaps are prone on their first time in New York, finds his friend's apartment empty and no sign of his friend. Never mind because he is immediately adopted by his friend's 'kooky' neighbour, and then just as quickly is visited by two black hoods who drag him off to see their boss.The inane banter between the two hoods and the fact that nabbing our naïve young hero is so obviously a question of mistaken identity, as well as the 'smart' dialogue between the grizzled old black gangster boss all do signal – in film terms – that we are watching a comedy, or at least a comedy of sorts. The hero gets to meet another gangster, the deadly rival of the black boss and by the end of the day is tasked both with killing the second boss's son and finding $30,000 to pay off a debt.And so it goes on, from one mistaken identity to another with an added layer of complication in that boss gangster bosses are under surveillance by New York's finest who are baffled as to who this chap is. It rambles on from one 'kooky' set-up to the rest until it all takes a rather darker turn which took me rather by surprise and will probably do the same for you, too.In the end everything is explained and – at least in its own terms as a film – there are no loose ends. I have to admit that it is all rather well done, with some great actors – Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley (sorry, Sir Ben, Sir Ben Kingsley) and that old trouper Stanley Tucci (who, in my view, never gives a bad performance, by the way – and some intriguing scenes. And yet . . .The film is most certainly not a comedy/drama by the time the credits roll – there is nothing very funny about the murderous violence that takes place – and for me at least the whole initial comedy schtick left an odd taste in my mouth, and the whole plot's resolution was, for me, just a tad too contrived: not just neat, too neat.Still in the first instance Lucky Number Slevin is intended as entertainment and it most certainly does entertain, though it has to be said, more in the way of a comic book than a serious thriller. But then that is what it is all about. I have given this film a 7 – it is handsomely made – but in an odd way a little reluctantly. Yes, it's good, but I have a sneaking suspicion it might well have been better had a little more thought been given to the script and had everyone involved just been a little less pleased with how clever they are (because that's the feeling I get.)",7,1,1,14 January 2014
3:10 to Yuma," The Western rehabilitated
","Once the staple of Fifties cinema-going, Westerns have gone out of fashion. The Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns started a trend towards stripping them West of glamour, and filmmakers in the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate oil-price inflation disillusioned Seventies soon picked got in on the act. Mud and misery, disease and everyone more or less in rags became the norm. Cowboy heroes were no longer incorruptible men in white hats, but just as savage as their nominally bad adversaries. Life in the new order Western was hard and brutal, and the only concession Tinseltown allowed was that the heroine was still desirable, unlike the women photographs of the era show us. Film heroines, after all, are film heroines and we can't have them being though ugly. By the Eighties anyone trying to raise money to make a Western was given short shrift by the financiers. There were, of course, the few brave exceptions, such as Unforgiven, the TV series Lonesome Dove and, more recently, the excellent The Assassination Of Jesse James etc., but they, too, embraced the new orthodoxy of a depicting a brutal, bloody, muddy and miserable West, and The Assassination etc, was perhaps not even a Western in the accepted sense. Neither, for that matter, was Altman's McCabe And Mrs Miller. So remaking 3.10 To Yuma was a brace decision and director James Mangold has come up trumps. But before I lay on the praise, I must vent my one gripe: the transformation of utterly ruthless killer Ben Wade (an excellent Russell Crowe) into a man who does, after all, have a streak of humanity doesn't convince. Well, it doesn't convince me. I watched this on DVD and re-watched it listening to Mangold's commentary in which he says he tried to get away from the idea of 'the villain' and wanted to portray Wade as a more rounded character. Well, it is true that he does, yet I cannot buy Wade's almost altruistic transformation. And as that, after all, is one of the film's main themes, it is quite a large faultline. Wade is utterly, utterly ruthless, a man for whom life means nothing. He kills without compunction and shows no remorse of any kind. The only kind of character who might behave as director Mangold wants us to believe Wade behaves would be a sociopath, and that was exactly the kind of character (according to the commentary) Mangold did not want to create. We are given a kind of explanation for Wade's complete lack of scruples - after his father died, he was abandoned by his mother as an eight-year-old, but that, in itself, is rather too pat, if not to say rather too glib, and explanation. We are also shown that he has an artistic streak - he likes sketching - and it is obvious that he is intelligent and self-aware. He even has a dry wit. But surely to goodness none of this even goes a little way to explaining is about turn when he assists Dan Evans (an also very good Christian Bale) against his own gang to deliver him to the train which will convey him to the gallows. Well, not for this viewers it didn't. There is one coda which might provide and explanation: as the train with Wade on board trundles on its way to Yuma, Wade whistles and his horse (I should imagine, although if it is his horse, it has changed colour) runs off to accompany the train. Wade has previously claimed that he has escaped from Yuma twice before and that often judges, guards and lawmen have helped him escape simply because they like him. The implication is that he will manage to do so again. And it is true that there is something - almost inexplicably - likable about this ruthless killer. That interpretation would, at least, be in keeping and, aesthetically, would stay in harmony with the rest of the film. As I say, Wade's apparent redemption - he even guns down the remainder of his gang - his my main gripe, although an important one. Two minor gripes are that in the final dash to the station, he loses his handcuffs. The keys were thrown away by Dan Evans earlier on. Perhaps they were taken off when he first entered the cell in the train, because that is when you first see him without them. They must have been taken off pretty damn fast and there would have been no reason to do so, anyway. Wade is, after all, a ruthless killer. So why take any chances? Then there is the surprisingly fast recuperation of Peter Fonda from being shot in the stomach. Uncredible just isn't the word. But having got those those points off my chest, I am bound to admit that, otherwise, Yuma scores on every level and then some. The plot is less than straightforward, we have an admirable hero in Christian Bale, whose determination and motivation to live up to his promise to deliver Wade to Yuma against all odds rings very true, we have a great coming of age performance by Logan Lerman as his son, there is plenty of ambivalence to satisfy even the most ardent modernist, the action sequences, though undoubtedly the result of clever editing, have none of the artificiality of too many other action movies - cut, cut, cut, and you haven't a clue what's going on - and it is only fair to say the Mangold comes up trumps. One last point is worth mentioning: neither Bale nor Crowe is American, and I do wonder whether that might have contributed to them bringing something fresh to their parts. Also convincingly and irredeemably nasty is Ben Foster as Wade's No 2 Charlie Prince. Finally, Peter Fonda turns up: I though his career hit the buffers years ago, but here he does a great job as, in his own way, an equally nasty Pinkerton's Agency mercenary. But boy does he look old, which means, unfortunately that so, probably, do I.",8,1,2,29 September 2009
Source Code," Good, old-fashioned sci-fi thriller hokum. Go for it
","Many of the objections cited here against various films, which invariably begin with the claim that 'this is 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back', baffle me. Those involved in filmmaking do so for any number of reasons ranging from the purely commercial to artistic and political, and however good or bad one thinks a film is, it is almost always very obvious why a particular film was made. And usually it is to attract a fee-paying public to cough up the readies to, naturally, cover all production costs and then turn a handsome profit. Source Code, billed as a sci-fi thriller, is one such film. But a great many user reviews on this website lambast it for 'poor science' and using various computer terms misleadingly. Well, what on earth were they expecting from a film? What did they make of the Star Wars series, of The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, Jurassic Park and any number of other films which deal, ever so superficially, science? So please don't be put off by some of the criticisms here. Source Code is a rollicking, very entertaining, intriguing and exciting film. No more, no less. It makes no grand statement, doesn't take itself too seriously, keeps you watching, includes loads of quite daft science, has a touching, though quite slight, romantic angle, and for my money is worth the time of anyone who would like to relax watching a well-made, entertaining film. Don't listen to the harping critics, sit down and watch this. You won't be a 'better person' afterwards, you won't have altered your political views, you won't be in tears, and you most definitely won't have learnt a little more science, but you will have enjoyed a great piece of sci-fi thriller hokum.",7,0,1,4 February 2013
Child 44," Confused? You will be. There's a good film struggling to get out, but sadly this isn't it
","Other reviews assure us that the film isn't a patch on the novel on which it is based, but as I haven't read the novel, I have no idea whether or not that is true. As it stands the film version of Child 44 has a lot going for it, though unfortunately it loses on points. It tries to do too much, doesn't quite know what kind of film it wants to be and ends up being none of them. It's a confused production, well-filmed, great direction, but at the end of the day so bloody confusing you might well - as I did - ask yourself: well, what was that all about.Set in Stalinist Russia it is great on atmosphere, great on conveying the sheer terror that existed while Stalin was still alive where husband could not talk openly to wife and more or less anything might - bad luck and chance being the major factors - get you killed or even worse.The setting is the film's strong point (though I think it might well have done better without the cod Russian accents). And the soundtrack - at least when I watched it on Amazon - was quite simply abysmal: I struggled to understand what had been said and even re-spooling the film a few minutes to watch a scene two or three times again - possible when watching a streaming or a DVD - didn't help. That is a technical failing for which there can be no excuse.Ostensibly it is all about one man's hunt to track down a serial killer in a paranoid, totalitarian state which proclaims itself to be such a paradise to live in that murder cannot exist. But there is so much more going on that it is bloody difficult to know what actually is going on. And that has to be down to the script and then the producers who should have called a halt to proceedings while the film script was sorted out. Sadly, they didn't.Visually, the film is as good as any you might see which has Ridley Scott as a producer. But there's a lot more to films than just what it looks like - story for one thing, and that is where the major confusion lies. In fact, it is all so confusing that I shan't event try to convey what it might - note might - be about.Where the whole thing really falls down is what is conventionally called the 'denouement'. Here Child 44 simply resorts to standard schlock western happy ending values, producing an 'ending' which is wholly ridiculous. Utterly, utterly ridiculous.So there you have it. My final comment will be this: at its heart there is here a great film to be made, but this simply isn't it. That great film, with a better, more focused story, must be made by an Eastern European film-making with a cynical heart - to reflect the utterly horrific times it portrays - and a clearer idea of just what it intends to convey.However, and possibly quite surprisingly, if you have half a mind to watch it, go ahead: the atmosphere of Stalinist terror is conveyed perfectly and, it has to be said, what the film shows is quite possibly not half as bad as what really happened. But bear in mind the overall experience is rather frustrating, if you want more than just atmosphere.Confused? I was and you might well be, too.PS Ask yourself why a high-value production made in 2015 is already available on Amazon. Well?",Null,0,0,31 December 2015
In Bruges," Whimsical and touching
","In many ways, In Bruges is something of a little gem. It is marketed as a 'dark comedy' and it is, indeed very funny if you like dry wit and irony and enjoy seeing the world through the eyes of two Dublin men who have rather inexplicably been ordered to leave London and lie low in an obscure Flemish town. That these two men happen to be killers is initially neither here nor there. They could — or, at least, Brendan Gleeson, as the older and more mature hit-man could — be just like any two tourists you might meet seeing the sights of a beautiful medieval town. Colin Farrell, the second, younger hit-man, is not at all enamoured of Bruges and sightseeing, and his lack of sophistication is typified when he memorably describes history as just a load of stuff that has happened. Where in Bruges is not something of a little gem is when it is reluctantly forced to abandon the Irish whimsy — one of the central conceits of a hit-man taking time off to relax and enjoy a spot of culture is nothing if not whimsical — and begins to plod down the more familiar paths of film-making convention. Thus the various whimsical strands of the story all come together in a rather neat finale, which is, unfortunately too neat to be satisfying. The writer/director Michael McDonagh can't be blamed for that, and as this is only his second feature — and his first full-length feature — his handling of the techniques of film-making is outstanding. So far he has written plays for the stage, and in many ways In Bruges is still a play which has been transferred to the big screen, and that is not meant in a derogatory way. The dialogue is naturalistic and, at times, exquisite. But in a sense In Bruges is still a play in that McDonagh wants to deal with rather big themes: conscience, guilt, a sense of honour, loyalty and revenge, and what might have worked well on stage finally doesn't work quite as well on the screen. Although oddly both the Gleeson and Farrell characters are rather likable despite the fact that they have killed without mercy for money, by the end of the film they don't quite ring as true as they did when we first meet them. Similarly, despite Ralph Fiennes's character being established as a sadistic crime boss without heart or feeling, his final honourable act is also wholly unconvincing. So where does that leave us? Well, because in so many way In Bruges is the excellent side of good, the reservations I make are rather ungenerous. My point is that because so much of the film is very good, it sets itself such high standards that when, in just a few respects, it doesn't quite meet those standards, this apparent 'failure' stands out all the more. Let me be clear: In Bruges is streets ahead of many other films which masquerade as 'comedy' or 'thriller' or 'drama'. In hindsight there are one or two niggles such as the implausibility of the Farrell character being discovered and arrested on a train leaving Bruges, the way that various characters conveniently bump into each other, and, it has to be said, the implausibility of some of the characters' motivation. But at the end of the day these are minor points. In Bruges stands alone and has an identity all of its own. I do, however, suspect that whether or not you enjoy In Bruges will largely depend on what kind of films you otherwise enjoy. Yes, there is a chase at the end, and, yes, it all ends in bloody, murderous violence, but these elements to not define the film, if you are the kind of moron who values so much of the dishonest, quick-cut, super-slick, in-yer-face mush which keeps the cinema cash tills ringing, you would undoubtedly feel your attention and interest flag long before the guns are fired. If, on the other hand, you have the wit and taste to watch a story unfold (however implausible that story might finally be) and enjoy the kind of Irish dry humour which is not in-yer-face, your will enjoy In Bruges very much.",7,1,4,5 July 2009
Lone Survivor," The usual gungho Hollywood schlock - cowboys and indians updated but no better
","Another reviewer here on IMDb who says he is a former SEAL assures us that the depiction of the 'frogmen', from their unkempt appearance and painted weapons to their living quarters and ops room is almost 100pc accurate. Well, hallelujah and yippee!He goes on to say that all SEALs and former SEALs have an eternal pride in fallen comrade who are never forgotten. Nothing wrong with that, in my book, but the circumstances in which they fell are often, as here, highly dubious and questionable. But more of that later. First to the film.In the second decade of the 21st millennium filmmaking techniques and equipment have come on apace: hand-held cameras add rather spurious realism, make-up is more realistic, we can now simulated a chap having the back of his head blown off with amazing verisimilitude (as far as I know - I've never actually seen it happen in real life), and computer editing and computer graphics are a godsend.But strip away all the modern equipment and techniques and this film was first made - and often since remade a hundred times - over 50 years ago: in those days the 'baddies' were what were then called 'red indians' and were slaughtered without ruth, and the 'goodies', the ones we were expected to cheer for, were the US army cavalry. Now the 'baddies' are the Taliban, who are slaughtered with ruth, and the 'goodies' are Navy SEALs, the 'frogmen'. And we're still expected to cheer.True to the cliché, the indians/Taliban baddies are nasty cutthroats who are apparently prepared to die in their hundreds for no obviously good reason, whereas the US cavalry/SEAL goodies are made of true grit and although most of them die - except, of course, the film's main star - they die bravely. And Lone Survivor is true to the cliché. That there's less to the film than meets the eye - despite the former SEAL reviewer who claims it is almost 100pc accurate - because quite obvious when, as has to happen in a film of this kind, things start to go wrong.The opening credits show us SEALs in training, in hard training, the sort wimps like you and I could never survive and we are then treated to an interminable number of minutes to the almost statutory 'bonding' scenes: virtually incomprehensible dialogue and loads of brotherly joshing which shows us that the well-trained killing machines 'care' about each other.Yet they don't, or they don't according to Lone Survivor: at the first hint of trouble they fall out and bicker, can't decide what to do, the chain of command is ignored and generally set the scene for screwing things up.There follows what is really nothing but an extended gunfight in which a great many Taliban get themselves killed - Lord, how stupid they are! - but our band of brothers soldier on and on and on, throwing themselves down rocky hillsides in an attempt to escape despite all being shot and wounded several times in multiple places.Finally, the last act in the cliché: our star, by now the 'lone survivor', is taken into the care of a 'good' Indian/Afghani and cared for, and this chap and his villagers are so noble that they are prepared to lose their lives just to protect 'the American'. Well, pass the sickbag. The film ends with the US cavalry/Apache gunships riding in to rescue the film's main star in a scene in which a further several hundred indians/Taliban are slaughtered. Overall, this is the laziest of lazy filmmaking and offensive claptrap.As for the politics of it all, here's a question: what right does the US think it has to invade a country such as Afghanistan? And why is it so surprised that 'the natives grow restless' and do all they can to kick out the invader? And why does the US expect the rest of the world to cheer on their gungho guntoting knuckleheaded idiots.Were any part of the US actually to be invaded, you could bet your bottom dollar that the US 'natives' would resort to their armoury of weapons to try to kick out the invaders. So why the surprise when the Taliban does the same?The final offence is, of course, that Lone Survivor was made in Hollywood to try to multiple the sums invested several times over as suburban nerds and geeks go along to their multiplex to wallow in bullshit. But then what's new. If you like the usual kind of gungho jingoistic crap, this film is for you. If you have read what I have to say and agree with me, give it a miss.",4,1,2,1 January 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino redefines what a turkey might be: this is very bad.
","It is slowly becoming apparent to me that Quentin Tarantino is something of a one-trick pony. And it really doesn't matter how many cineastic references you make, if you make them in a film which is simply not very good, such as Inglorious Basterds, it all becomes rather pointless. So much is mediocre to downright bad about this film that is difficult to know where to start. That there are, ironically, several very good performances in it - despite the idiotic film in which these take place - can, perhaps, be chalked up in Tarantino's credit, although I think it is more probably that he or his producer simply struck lucky when he chose his various casting agents. Inglorious Basterds strikes me as nothing more than a bad TV movie script by a not very bright though puerile teenager which somehow gets to be made on a big budget. And that is being kind. We are asked to accept that a film which starts with the brutal massacre of a Jewish family can then blandly go on to expect to be regarded as something of a light comedy. For 'light comedy' is what I assume Tarantino thought he was making. But do graphic scenes of scalping and a man having his brains beaten to mush with a baseball bat really create that many laughs? Tarantino seems to think so. The films then meanders along a rather silly plot line involving a British film critic turned serving soldier, a well-known German movie star who is - larks! - an British agent, Churchill, Hitler, Goebbels, a young Jewish woman who escaped the massacre of her family to arrive in Paris to run a cinema - and on it tediously goes. Lord how Tarantino must have chortled when he wrote the script. How clever Quentin must have thought he was. There is no thought here, no direction, no heart. It is just a mush of ideas, with the odd scene which plays well. But none of those reasonably good scenes adds up to a row of beans when it is all stitched together into a whole. Oddly enough, it is almost far too ridiculous to take this film seriously on any level, almost ridiculous even to discuss it seriously. Tarantino has a certain gift for making a certain kind of film. But take him out of that comfort zone, take him away from his one trick, and the alarming paucity of his imagination becomes all too painfully apparent. And what on earth persuaded Brad Pitt to get involved in a project as tiresome as Inglorious Basterds beats me. If you think Abbot and Costello liberate Auschwitz would have made a great comedy, this is for you. Otherwise find something better to do and save your money.",2,17,39,24 May 2010
Amistad," Exquisitely made feelgood schlock which ultimately tells a big lie
","As a film, as entertainment, as a night at the flicks, as a great way to spend well over two hours wallowing in non-stop feelgoodery Amistad is superb, and Steven Spielberg does quite brilliantly what only he and a few others can achieve. The acting is the finest, his actors are the finest, his script is the finest, his direction in which he balances action with reflection is the finest, and no doubt as for cinematography, sound design, editing and the rest a man of Spielberg's stature in the industry is able to employ the finest professionals working in film-making and he so obviously does so.So why do I feel that at the end of the day Spielberg's Amistad is simply nothing but 154 minutes of appalling sentimental schlock and, worse, appalling and dishonest sentimental schlock. I have no doubt that after watching Amistad Americans in their thousands have left the cinemas or turned off their DVD player and thought to themselves or even said out aloud: We are the finest nation on Earth and while we exist, the world is truly a better place. Well, perhaps all those who did and do so might care to pause a moment or two and ask themselves why the proportion of black and coloured inmates in U.S. jails compared to whites is still higher than the proportion of blacks and coloureds which make up the population of the U.S. They might care to ask themselves why a higher proportion of blacks and coloureds are unemployed, live in poverty and have a far lower standard of education. They might care to ask themselves why, almost 60 years after the hearing of the Amistad case before the Supreme Court the so-called Jim Crow laws were enacted denying blacks anything but equality with whites.But it's just a film, you might be saying, come on, don't be so uptight about it. Well, granted that it's not just the Americans but we Brits and the French, the Germans, the Russians, in fact every nation on earth who regularly chose to rewrite its history in films, novels, plays and poetry the calumny is not isolated or even unusual. We Brits like to bang on about what a civilising influence our glorious empire was and ignore completely the misery its establishment engendered and the huge number of deaths that were thought necessary for it to continue civilising 'savages'. And what after all, you might care to argue, is the 'truth'? One man's truth is another man's folly, perhaps, or one man's open mind is another man's gullibility. Well, I'll gracefully take the point but respond by pointing out the facts I cited above of the comparative freedoms and affluence of blacks and coloureds compared to whites in America. And I might ask why, when Hurricane Katrina devastated large parts of New Orleans, was hardly any assistance offered for several days? Why, it might be something to do with the fact that establishment America didn't and doesn't quite rate a black chocolate city like New Orleans has high as rather more top-drawer municipalities (although down-at-heel white communities aren't exactly privileged). And when we talk of 'establishment America', we might add that Hollywood and its filmmakers are one of its essential constituent parts.By all means enjoy Amistad as a film, a piece of fiction, but please don't run away with the idea that despite portraying historical incidents - although one larded with fictional characters: Morgan Freeman's dandified citizen is especially offensive, particularly since every other black face in the film is, if not an African from the Amistad, a servant or pauper. The incessant and remorseless feelgood soundtrack should serve as a warning: on and on and on it goes, all patriotic flutes, trumpets, syrupy strings. A good case could be made about accompanying some film soundtracks with the notice that 'this soundtrack can adversely influence your judgement'. When a 15-minute scene of a grand American figure such as John Quincy Adams grandly making grandly patriotic observations has a backdrop of such a patriotic melange of flutes, trumpets and strings, you just know something very rum is going on.Giving Amistad a rating presents a real problem: as filmmaking it is very fine indeed and Spielberg is a filmmaker almost without peer. But unfortunately a film which sets out to do what he has attempted to do needs more, not least true honesty, so this one, Stevie, can only get a five, because five is halfway between zero and ten.",5,9,17,1 April 2012
Public Enemies," Two and a half cheers - at least it's got Depp in it
","Oh dear, I have just read three reviews by professional critics who have probably forgotten more about film-making than I shall ever know - including the by now not only venerated by venerable Roger Ebert - and I disagree with them. So what does that say about my judgment. Not a lot really, I am bound to admit. Ebert especially admires Michael Mann's art, his attention to detail, his obsessions with getting the little things right, and it has to be said that Public Enemies doesn't show you Hollywood's notion of the Depression, it seems to show you the Depression. So why do I find myself only able to give the film two cheers, despite the attendance of Johnny Depp, who can act the pants of most of the competition? All I can say is that I found it rather an old-fashioned film despite the hand-held camera-work and the special effects. To me, though obviously not to Ebert and the others, it never really settled anywhere, yet seemed at times, especially the 'death scene' to be shot through with a somewhat spurious significance. Potentially interesting aspects of Dillinger's life were touched up but never examined. In a way it reminded me of Scorsese's Aviator about Howard Hughes: both amble along from beginning to end, but - well, why exactly were they made (apart, of course, to get the punters paying top dollar and keeping the moneymen happy?) In Public Enemies we have an obviously corruptible FBI evolving into the force it became under an obviously corruptible Hoover, we have the Mob casting Dillinger adrift because he is 'bad for business', we have his status as a 'folk hero' and a latter-day Robin Hood, yet these are more or less touched upon in passing. None is investigated, though doing so might have given the film rather more depth. I got rather confused by the gang members and who they were, but perhaps that is just my fault. Then there is the man himself: depicted as something of a fatalist, it would be interesting to know what drove Dillinger. And if we can't have the truth, well why not make something up - it's done all the time and is known as art. The central love affair between the man and his moll is also, to put it bluntly, rather uninteresting and I, for one, was not in the slightest moved by Billie Frechette's anguish. I should add that I was rather underwhelmed by Heat and the emphasis on having the two stars acting together (a follow-up intended to cash in on having De Niro and Al Pacino act together again was, I understand, something of a damp squib). So there you have it: you can take the pros' word for it and regard this as a great film. Or you can listen to what I say and take such claims with a pinch of salt. But go and see it anyway, if only for yet another great Depp performance.",5,1,2,2 January 2010
The Irishman," Tinseltown old timers try it one last time (and really should not have bothered)
","Hollywood thrives on cliches: in many ways they are its lifeblood. But the Tinseltown moguls shouldn't be castigated. The moviegoer thrives on cliches, too, and if a mogul is criticised for serving up at the umpteenth time cliche 123/A he or she is perfectly entitled to the defence that 'that's what the punter wants'. They want predictable, they want to see the same storyline over and over again. Give them something halfway original (as in all that dubious European art stuff) and many just run scared: they want to see the world on the edge of destruction saved by the love of a good woman for a man who only had to find that brave core he didn't know was there. Or something.Cliches are great both for directors and writers and for moviegoers. Cliches mean that neither has to think at all, just fill in the boxes and trace the story from A to Z. They are not required to,use their nut a little. To be fair, if the wind were to blow in the opposite direction and the moviegoing public suddenly decided it won't settle for anything else but pure originality, there is enough talent in Hollywood which could supply that demand. Back in the real world, however, the growth of a demand for originality is as likely as Britain's queen ditching Phil the Greek and marrying Pope Francis. So cliches rule.I happen not to like cliches. After a lifetime working in newspapers I have had it to here with them. At first they amuse, then they amuse because their use is so predictable. Finally, they irritate as little can irritate.One Hollywood cliche I spotted years ago and is about as entertaining as a day in the rain without a coat is the 'old timers (whether soldiers, football players, mercenaries, a band or what the hell you like) are summoned to come together for one last time and prove they can still cut it'. And of course they always do. 'There's life in the old dogs yet' is the message. and ageing, geriatric moviegoers leave the cinema relieved that they aren't quite you dead (which, of course, they are, but sshh...)Invariably the old timers in the 'old timers' film are all themselves old timer actors whose day came and went quite long ago, but who, like the characters they portray on screen, want to prove to the up-and-coming young turks that they can still cut it, boy, we're still around. Well, of course, they aren't. Such films are - for me at least - and embarrassment like watching your grandad on the dancefloor who has no idea how bloody ridiculous he looks.The film that always comes to mind when I think of the 'old timers' cliche is The Wild Geese: old timers Richard Burton, Roger Moore, Richard Harris, Hardy KrÃ¼ger and Stewart Grainger strut their stuff as mercenaries called out of retirement to make more money for the Hollywood moguls.It was the old timers cliche which very soon came to mind when I say The Irishman. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and, sad but true, the director Martin Scorsese go through the motions of strutting their stuff and are as convincing as a cheap Walmart toupee.All five do their stuff, the stuff we once loved when it was fresh and new, but which is no longer fresh and new, not by a million miles. And it certainly doesn't help that all of them, Pesci, De Niro, Pacino and Keitel look way over 70, even when they are supposed to be young thugs on the make - the digital whatever just doesn't work.In many ways the worst offender is Scorsese in that he is an intelligent filmmaker who should have known better. But he didn't and he pretty much serves up a parody of a Scorsese film: if you've seen Goodfellas and Casino, you've seen The Irishman.The 'trademark' tracking shots, the convoluted storyline, the freeze-frame to give a brief biographical outline of a newly introduced character, the 'cool' violence, the voiceover - it's all there and it's all a bit sad in that what was once exciting is now terrible old hat.You might be part of the 90pc who like cliches served up lukewarm, who will applaud a faded nightclub singer warbling off-key because you are nostalgic and you like his hits when you were younger. That's not me. With all respect to Mr Scorsese, he really should have left well alone.",5,2,6,8 February 2020
The Fifth Element," Don't waste your time: this fails at every level
","There's a fine line between entertaining camp and complete rubbish, but Luc Besson hasn't found it. The Fifth Element breaks the 11th Commandment: it confuses, and then some.All of us are prepared to give more or less anyone the element of doubt, but if, after about ten minutes and after at least five pseudo-stylish modes of film-making your average viewer has absolutely no idea of what is going on and, more seriously, no interest either, all bets are off.The Fifth Element is a mess and, worse, a boring mess. From the off from the stylised French/Italian film-making on to the silly pseudo futuristic scenes creating the superwoman, this film tries to hit some kind of target and misses by a country mile. Don't bother.",2,6,14,29 November 2014
Black Book," Undemanding lazy potboiler for undemanding lazy people
","I came across Black Book after reading somewhere that after his post Robocop and Basic Instinct decline into absurdity, Black Book marked a glorious return to form for Paul Verhoeven, And needing a DVD to watch and coming across Black Book at £3 in an Asda (the UK's Wall-Mart) bargain bin, I thought 'why not?'Well, I should, perhaps, also have asked myself just what a movie - the most expensive Dutch movie ever made, no less - was doing languishing in the bargain bins less than 10 months after its release. I suspect you know where this is going. I had, in fact, only ever seen Robocop of Verhoeven's earlier films and had rather liked it's satirical touches, although on reflection it hadn't quite been the satire I had thought it to have been. Black Book made me ask myself: when we watch a movie, exactly what is it we want? Simple entertainment or something greater? Well, often, of course, it's simple entertainment.Despite all the 'auteurs' and the 'homage' we 'serious' film fans are supposed to pay 'auteurs', there also has to be time out when we can set aside the quest to investigate the human condition for an hour or two, grab the popcorn and settle down to watch a little undemanding nonsense. And why not? Yet when a movie chooses to deal with what was one of the most shocking and tragic periods of recent European history and which, furthermore, directly acknowledges the most horrific aspect of that time, the wholesale slaughter of millions of Jews, quite apart from also touching upon such ultra-sensitive areas as the degree and methods of the Dutch resistance and the collaboration of other Dutch with the Nazis, including the betrayal of fellow citizens for venal gain, it is surely fair to expect that movie to rise a little above the status and ambitions of 'undemanding nonsense'.But, to his shame, Paul Verhoeven never even tries to. He is quite content to churn out a large-scale potboiler, and one, furthermore, whose script is surprisingly lazily put together for a movie with this kind of budget and apparent aims. It would be tedious and boring for both you, the reader, and me, the writer, to list the script's many, many flaws and inconsistencies. I'll simply remark that Verhoeven and his co-writer were not in the slightest concerned with producing a truthful and honest tale. All they wanted to do was to make sure 'the action' roared ahead at breakneck speed and that you and I were given no opportunity at all to question the plot's many twists and turns. So: if 'undemanding nonsense' is your thing, packaged with a spurious mystery and a little, tho' not much, trademark Verhoeven soft porn, this is the film for you, available at your nearest supermarket bargain bin.If, given Black Book's painful and tragic subject matter, you want a movie which takes both you and itself seriously, forget it.",4,3,6,9 July 2013
Hot Fuzz," Wildly, thoroughly over the top and a hugely enjoyable romp
","There is still something about many British-made films which makes them disappointingly – well, British. I'm not talking about the 'British' films which are, in fact U.S. productions made with U.S. money and are merely touted by our homegrown cheerleaders as being 'British' because they were made in British-based film studios with British technicians. I mean those which are a tad small-scale and which have a kind of defiant dog-in-the-manger feel to them. It's not just that the production values are lower, it's also how quickly they can resort to well-worn clichés and trade on a mythical Britishness. But there are now many British films which wholly transcend that feel, and Hot Fuzz is one of them. It, too, resorts to clichés, but does so fondly to send them up. Yes, it is ludicrously over the top but enjoyably so. Not once does it pull its punches, not once do the film drop its guard and give us a knowing wink which is a current failing of quite a few contemporary British comic actors: throughout it succeeds in spades because it is played dead straight, and is all the funnier for that. I saw this within hours of watching Paul, another Simon Pegg and Nick Frost vehicle and that, although also very entertaining, loses on points because, being made for the U.S. market and in the process being so oppressed by the imperative to succeed that it pulled its punches all too often. Hot Fuzz never does, from the tongue in cheek send-up of a small Gloucestershire town and its phoney bucolism, through to the gruesome murders and the wild carnage of the closing gunfight where most of the town's great and good are slaughtered. It would be difficult to exaggerate just how over the top it is, but despite that it hits the spot each time. For this viewer, at least, it is 100pc successful.",Null,0,0,3 September 2011
Troy," Solid Hollywood epic. Just enjoy
","With actors given such dialogue as 'The Sun God is the patron of Troy - our enemy. Take whatever treasure you can find' and 'What are you doing in thrall to that pig of a king?' you'd'd think that a film such as Troy is stymied from the off. But you'd be wrong. I have to admit that dialogue is not this film's strongest suit, but what it does do is to lay down the ground rules, to prepare you for the kind of film it is: this is, in essence, a glorious Hollywood epic of the old school and, it has to be said, one verybworthy of that genre. The saintly Roger Ebert, with whom I find myself having to disagree more than once (his encyclopaedic knowledge of film and film making notwithstanding) grumbles that 'Troy is based on the epic poem The Iliad by Homer, according to the credits. Homer's estate should sue'. Elsewhere other IMDb reviewers complain that Troy is not true to Homer's Iliad, that the gods have been written out of the film, that historically – and odd complaint to make about a myth – the film is inaccurate because the Greeks and Trojans didn't have horses which in Petersen's version are abundant. Oh dear. They entirely miss the point: this is not a film version of the Iliad, this is a film in its own right 'based on the Iliad' and Petersen and his scriptwriter have every right to do as they damn well please. And it is to their credit that they neither sell you short, nor stray into pretension and try to make out there's more to their version, more depth, more meaning. If you want to stick to Homer's version , go and read it. If you want an 'historically accurate' version of the Iliad, don't bother with Troy. If on the other hand you want and exceptionally well-made, imaginative and thoroughly entertaining film 'based on the Iliad', this is your number. From Brad Pitt and Eric Bana to reliable Peter O'Toole and a gallery of old Brit thespians who can do this kind of thing with their eyes closed, there is any number of strong performances. OK, so there aren't any particularly moving dramatic scenes, except when O'Toole's King Priam ventures incognito into the enemy camp and Achilles' tent to reclaim the body of his slain son Hector, but – do I really have to repeat it? – it isn't that kind of film. And of the kind of film it is, it is better than many. Petersen makes ample use of CGI, but the film is not dominated by it, and it serves the film. In many ways calling the film Troy is a misnomer. Achilles is, more or less, the central and most interesting character. Ebert moans that Homer's Achilles was not introspective and did not sulk on the sidelines. The only answer to that is: well Petersen's Achilles is and does. As portrayed by Brad Pitt, Achilles is a superb warrior, an almost unbeatable warrior who finds it a little difficult to reconcile himself to the death he causes, but who is under no illusions that those who live by the sword, as he does, must inevitably die by the sword. His Acilles, and Eric Bana's Hector, almost break out of the two dimensions this kind of epic reduces its characters to and provide something more. That they don't quite do so is simply down to the fact that if they had done, this would no longer be the kind of film it is intended to be: (for the third or fourth time) and epic. So ignore the whingers and complainers. Sit back and enjoy a rollicking yarn. I was going to give this a 7, but on reflection it's getting an 8. It might not be gold, but of its kind it is pretty damn good.",8,2,4,22 November 2010
Midnight in Paris," Not just a very, very silly film but downright embarrassing. Avoid
","Is it OK to review a film of which you have seen only 40 minutes? Discuss. But on the assumption that I won't be shot at dawn for daring to do so, let me carry one (and confirm what I'm sure you already suspect) that for this viewer Midnight In Paris is another Woody Allen clunker. In fact, it is often so wooden, so badly directed, so trite, so superficial, so unconvincing and, finally, so downright bloody dull that you really wonder whether all those quite good Allen films you saw in the past are just rose-tinted false memories. Whoever coughs up the readies for Allen to produce this kind of silly dross must still be convinced the old phoney still has it, or perhaps it is merely a tax scam. Who knows? Who cares?The idea behind Midnight In Paris is not a bad one, but it needed a script and direction by someone with less of a dead hand than Allen to carry it off. As it is the whole exercise is an embarrassing waste of time.The script: it might well have been written by a would-be filmmaker of minimal talent it's so threadbare and thin. (And by the way at the time the film was set Hemingway had not yet published his first novel and only published two very slim volumes of short stories, and had not yet ever gone big-game hunting so he would not have known any 'rhino hunters'. As for Hemingway's reference to a battle in which he fought the Germans, that, too, is complete tosh - he did not fight but served as an ambulance driver after the US army, navy and marines turned him down because of an eye defect - though as Hemingway was something of a self-aggrandising mythomaniac, at least his account of battle is in character.)The direction is equally amateurish: two-dimensional, static, flat and - yet again - dull, just how did Allen ever gain his reputation in the first place?
So there you have it: if this review appears I shall know that charitably (they probably also disliked Midnight In Paris) IMDB's editors have allowed it to slip through even though this writer could not bring himself to see the whole film.My advice to you is don't even bother to see any of it. Find something else to do, wash up, clean the house, memorise the Bible - all three and many other pastimes will be far more appealing and satisfying.",3,4,6,10 January 2019
Cloverfield," Just enjoy the ride
","Let's get the obvious quibbles out of the way first: that someone, even someone as apparently irritating as Hud, should carry on filming come what may in they way he did is, well, very hard to swallow. And that battery life! As one of the characters might say: Oh my God! But, of course, without him doing just that there would be no film. Second quibble: surely to goodness Manhattan, what with all its gossips and their cells passing on the latest before it has even happened would surely somehow know a monster is on its way, especially a monster as extremely ugly as the one in Cloverfield. Ugly in Manhattan? Impossible. But apparently not. Having made those two, points, however Cloverfield isn't half bad. And the special effects/visual effects are quite remarkable. I'm assuming, of course, that they were special effects and that Manhattan wasn't destroyed for the sake of art. Plot there is none. Dialogue, only what you would hear from any gaggle of self-regarding yuppies fleeing a monster. Beyond that, well, nothing really. But it could have been a lot worse. Quite what the point of Cloverfield is is hard to say, so just enjoy the ride.",7,0,0,25 June 2009
The Hateful Eight," Ponderous, longwinded, derivative and sadistic - yes, Tarantino's back
","First of all some figures: The Hateful Eight cost $44m to make and in six months had made $145m - over three times as much. Those are the kind of figures producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein like, and while Quentin keeps the box office cash tills ringing, Bob and Harvey, or whoever else Quentin approaches with his latest script, will carry on saying 'yes, Quentin, of course, Quentin, and can I get you another olive for your martini, Quentin?' His previous two stinkers also made a lot of loot: Django Unchained cost $100m and pretty soon returned $425m worldwide; Inglorious Basterds cost $75m and soon brought in $321m worldwide).Admittedly, those $145m came from someone's pockets, so someone and their friends must like the kind of cack Quentin has been turning out remorselessly since the very good Reservoir Dogs and good, though, not great Pulp Fiction. And you can't argue with such cash figures, you'll be saying. Well, if that's your line, let me remind you of the wisdom to 'eat sh*t, seven trillion flies can't be wrong'. Oh, yes they can.Elsewhere on this site you will find The Hateful Eight lauded to high heaven and given superlative ratings. But you will also see very low ratings and criticism of various kinds. My advice: ignore the fanboys who might well enjoy gratuitous blood and gore as much as our Quentin. Go by what the naysayers have to say. Despite some initial great photography - not Quentin's department though - this is pretty dire.To be fair, I don't think The Hateful Eight is quite as bad as Django Unchained, although it, too, has seams of bargain basement political correctness about race and colour running through it of the kind which is actually just as insulting to blacks. But it also has the same faults: an artlessly contrived plot, a horribly uneven pace, superficially clever dialogue which actually sounds only like superficially clever dialogue and an awfully stagey direction.The Hateful Eight, in fact, comes across as a ham mystery play transferred to the screen by someone who has no idea that film has its own imperatives. Heresy? The boy Quentin doesn't know about film, I say. Well, on the evidence of this flat-footed effort, he certainly seems to have forgotten whatever you insist he once knew.Quentin also manages to elicit from a respectable line-up of actors some pretty wooden performances: they all, even Mr Samuel Jackson, one of my favourite actors, come across as speaking lines from someone's smart script. They all seem to be acting, sometimes acting well, but still acting, and only the director, one Quentin Tarantino, can be blamed for that. He might know how to put together a bloodfest gunfight, but he often seems clueless as to how to give his actors directions.Other reviews such as this one have tended to mention historical inaccuracies and other infelicities. I was surprised to hear one character describe another as 'paranoid' - what, in mid-19th century Wyoming? I don't think so. But my gripes have nothing really much to do with that.My gripes have to do with the boy Quentin's filmmaking: he's just not as good as he obviously thinks he is. Not by a long chalk. The characters are stock characters, most of the films consists of series of one-to-one setpieces and his convoluted plots are only convoluted because that is Quentin's schtick.In The Hateful Eight he even pulls a fast one: two-thirds of the way through we get a narration and a very hamfisted new element is introduced to get the ball rolling again. It's as though busily writing his script he had reached a kind of dead end and didn't quite know where to go next.What Quentin needs is someone to tell him 'this just isn't very good, laddie, try again'. But while those cash tills keep a'ringin that really isn't going to happen.The film is almost two and a half hours long, and I wanted to give up after an hour. I only kept going because I knew I would be writing this review, and it was only fair I saw the lot. On the other hand, if you want to give up after an hour, by all means do so. You will really not miss much at all and might even find something more useful to do. And you will even not have to witness a particularly unpleasant scene where a woman is hanged.By the way: just how did two badly injured men, one of whom couldn't move at all, the other just revived from a fainting fit but who could also barely move manage to rustle up a hanging rope complete with a very professional noose from somewhere and get the hanging done? Oh, and if you do give up - as I advise - you will also be spared a particularly mawkish, not to say dishonest epilogue involving a letter apparently written by Abraham Lincoln to the black character. Oh dear.",4,4,7,8 January 2017
Crash," Truthful, honest and admirably entertaining film-making which takes risks
","I must insist that the thoughts I record when writing my reviews for IMDb are all my own, but before starting a review, I almost always read several others. I always include reading those by Roger Ebert (who, believe it or not, can drop some terrible clangers as to the detail of films — I first noticed this in his reviews of Unforgiven and A Chorus Line — which do rather shake your confidence in his judgment); and The Guardian here in Britain as well as those enthusiastic IMDb members who, like me, like to add our two ha'porth worth. Among the members' reviews there are invariably those which go to extremes and laud this or that film as quite possibly the best film ever made (presumably until they write their next review), and those that insist that this or that film is just so bad, it should be put out for cat litter. I find it difficult to take either of those kinds of reviews seriously. But Crash is one such film which arouses extreme emotions. As for the external reviewers, Ebert liked it (I think — it's not always were clear what he thinks) but one of the reviewers for the Guardian was lukewarm. His criticisms can be summed up as 'liberals being self-consciously 'edgily' un-PC' — he suspects that in various pitches to drum up support for the film, the fact that its treatment of race is 'edgy' was much to the forefront. Admittedly, the acknowledged aim of writer/director Paul Haggis was to make us, the viewers, aware that racism is everywhere and even in ourselves if we care to look closely enough, and in the Guardian reviewer's view that is about as original as announcing that water is wet. Yet on this occasion the chap is being too harsh. The 'message' of Crash is, perhaps, not quite as earth-shattering as Haggis would have us believe, but if, just for the moment, one can put the 'message' to one side, he and his producers deserve a great deal of credit for the film he made. It is never, ever dull and at times is immensely gripping. OK, there might, or might not, be some truth in the charge that Haggis's array of characters do tend to the stereotype, but from the six years I worked as a newspaper reporter I know that, without exception, each and every one of us can tend to stereotype if viewed from a distance. It is only when others get to know us better that our individuality emerges, but even then — well, the news isn't always great. How often have we got to know someone better and discovered traits which weren't at all to our liking? Crash stands out in that there are no heroes or villains, no good guys and bad guys, merely people with their several flaws. It is very refreshing to watch a film such as Crash. It is a truthful. There is none of that posturing to effect all to common in modern cinema, and the characters shown in Crash behave as, in my experience, people do. At no point did it sound a false note. As for the sheer and admittedly huge coincidence of everyone coming into contact with everyone else, well, that didn't bother me a jot. Do we complain that Twelfth Night is unrealistic in that it is highly unlikely a woman could successfully masquerade as a man so well that another woman falls in love with her believing her to be a man? And although it would be presumptious to compare Paul Haggis to William Shakespeare they have in common that they are creating, or attempting to create, works of art. As far as I am concerned the essence of art, whether it be pure sound, paint on canvas, hewn stone, a film, a novel or a performance by an actor is manipulation and at the end of the day the only thing that counts is whether the creator of that work of art carries it off. And most certainly Haggis does carry it off. At no point does the level of coincidence jar. Overall, Crash is a one-off and a very successful one-off at that. If you like good cinema, do yourself a favour and give it a whirl. You really will not regret it. There is not a bad performance in it.",8,0,5,13 June 2010
The Beach," Two-dimensional at best and at worst . . .
","First question: what's missing? Because something most certainly is, but it is rather hard to pin down quite what that might be. The mystery is that Danny Boyle knows how to make films and then some, but put aside the actual film itself — the acting, the direction, the locations, the action — and instead simply consider the story he tells and the themes he attempts to deal with and The Beach is, to put it mildly, a bit of a mess. Most of the ingredients are there — most, but not all — but mixed in such a way that, sad to say, the moral of The Beach doesn't add up to a row of beans. So why not? What was missing? I suspect that it made a better novel than it does a film. Novels allows the writer more freedom in many crucial ways (I imagine). Films rather tie you down and you run the risk of being far too literal. Every character in The Beach is, at best two-dimensional, and as far as characterisation and motivation are concerned we end up watching something which is closer to a cartoon than a film. Most of the characters are less than two-dimensional, they are one-dimensional, and that is a shame, because treated more sensitively and intelligently, and if it were perhaps less subject to commercial constraints — i.e. with 'heartthrob' Leonard DiCaprio as your main star, making money at the box office will have been very close to the top of the list of the producers' aspirations — there is a very good, very engaging and very thought-provoking film to be made from the material to hand. But The Beach simply isn't it and that by a long chalk. It needed subtlety and it has no subtlety, the central theme (reminiscent of Lord Of The Flies) needs space and time to develop. It is given none. I have no idea what leeway Danny Boyle had, and if he had a lot, the ultimate failure is his, given that he obviously intended to make several 'deep' points'. The story simply does not develop. Crucial scenes are simply presented and the viewer can take it or leave it. Characters do things, but their actions have no basis in their personality. Why did Daffy, the mad Scotsman played with relish by Robert Carlyle, feel the need to escape an apparent paradise and kill himself? There is not even the hint of an explanation. Sal, the apparent leader of those live in the commune, a strong woman with obvious fascist tendencies, should have been far more fleshed out. Who was she, why does this hippie behave so ruthlessly? And there are the members of the commune themselves, faceless to a man and woman: what happened to them that they can apparently with no scruples whatsoever banish one of their own after he becomes badly injured and starts dying of gagrene and they are unable to deal with the noise he makes. Such behaviour deserves at least to be analysed and explored, but Boyle does nothing of the kind. He simply presents it as fact and that is it. Then there is the apparent descent into madness of Richard: what is going on? It happens very fast, he does extraordinary things and finally even kills one of the commune — a murderous act which is ludicrously presented as a mercy killing — but there is neither rhyme nor reason to any of it. These are fatal flaws for a film with obvious pretensions to being 'deep' and which purports to deal with 'deep' ethical and moral quesitons. There are those, of course, who think that there is memorable significance in the lyrics of pop songs and for them The Beach is a reasonable actioner. At the end of the day it all depends what you want. All I can say is that given it's central theme of the ultimate corruptibility of man (and, most pertinently, woman) I was nowhere near getting what I wanted. Sorry. If a film sets itself up to deliver, it sure as hell must deliver, but The Beach delivers nothing but a potpurri of apparent significance. And that's not good enough.",3,3,5,8 July 2009
Black Mass," A tad two-dimensional, sad to say. Good, yes, but ...
","There's something oddly flat about Black Mass, a take on the life of Jimmy 'Whitey' Bulger, the notorious Chicago gang leader, but it didn't really occur to me until I'd seen the film. The film is structured more or less in flashback, with various of Bulger's henchmen, who really have nothing to lose, opening up to the FBI about their boss's various crimes, which include a long list of murders.So we get scenes of Bulger as he sets out and as he is recruited by an old school chum who just happens to be an FBI hero as an informant. Bulger, who can't abide 'rats' and who has killed men merely for arguing with him, doesn't, of course, see it that way and likes to regard his relationship with the FBI as 'an arrangement'. But whatever you call it, it played very much in his favour. The pitch was that as the FBI is more concerned with bringing down organised Mafia crime in the north of the city, it will turn a blind eye to the nefarious dealings of the 'Southey' Bulger as long as he feeds them information to help bring down the Mafia.Then we move on a few years to Bulger, under the protection of his FBI handler, being far more established in the Southside and making a pretty penny. We move on again to a later version of Bulger, this time involved in the murder of a businessman he is working with. And on it goes. It's all very interesting and very well done, and Johnny Depp especially, made up to such an extent that you hardly recognise the man, does a good job of creeping us out. And yet . . .Given that the relationship Bulger had with his corrupt FBI buddy is central to the film (and which was the case in real life – the bent FBI agent is now serving 40 years in clink), it is hard not to compare Black Mass with Martin Scorsese's The Departed, which covers the same ground, but which fleshes out the subject matter by introducing a story and a new character, another Southey FBI man who works undercover as part of the Bulger character's gang to expose the mole the FBI begin to believe they have in their ranks.That is partly why The Departed scored where Black Mass just doesn't: despite the murders, despite the creepy scenes involving Bulger, despite everything there isn't really that much too Black Mass. In many ways it could be a documentary. And to be honest we want more than just a documentary, we want a story and sadly Black Mass doesn't give us a story in the film sense.It is well-made, though and doesn't deserve to be written off because it isn't as good as Scorsese's The Departed. It's just that it's a shame it isn't quite a bit better.",6,1,1,9 October 2016
Interstellar," Rattling good sci-fi hokum - enjoy and stop quibbling
","Reading the reviews here on IMDb as I do after watching a film, I am yet again surprised at how many of those posting them seem to forget that films are primarily intended as entertainment. OK, it's not pure science but as entertainment Christopher Nolan's Interstellar scores heavily: it's got most of what you need. There's intrigue, a daft but not too daft plot, humour, suspense, sentiment, loads and loads of hokum – boy do we love hokum – and, as this is sci-fi, loads of pseudo-science.On top of all that, there's impressive cinematography and special effects (though the score isn't up to much, I have to admit). So of those who criticise Interstallar for being scientific gobbledegook I would respond: would you really criticise a Porsche sports car for not making a great cup of coffee? Yes, the science is hokum and you don't have to be a scientist to know that. But that really isn't the point.I'm not an unreserved Christopher Nolan fan and I thought his Batmans to be ponderous and even rather dull. But the lad does know how to conjure up a spectacle and here he does it in spades. There's also a rather touching story of how a father keeps his promise to his daughter and enough middle-brow profundity to satisfy most adolescents of all ages.There a far more respectable sci-fi films dealing with similar subject matter – Jodie Foster's Contact is a good example – but, to get back to my first point, Nolan's Interstellar is intended as entertainment and in that respect it fires on all cylinders.So ignore the geeks who point out that 'what they do is impossible' – of course it is. But that's not the point. Just enjoy the ride. And if, like me, you come close to shedding a quiet tear at the end when Dad (at the centre of a black hole, no less, several million light years away in a different galaxy) manages to communicate – by Morse code – with the young daughter (back on Earth in real time) whose heart he broke when he first agreed to star in Nolan's epic – sorry, travel into space to save mankind – you can be sure the film ain't at all bad. Which it isn't.If you want science, go off and study science while we get on with enjoying the film.",7,0,3,25 September 2015
Pacific Rim," Don't get your hopes up if you are 11 or older
","After the intriguing Pan's Labyrinth, we were, perhaps, entitled to expect something with a little more brains from Guillermo del Toro. Well, Pacific Rim sadly isn't it. It isn't bad as blockbusters go (and I should admit I, for one, am usually underwhelmed by blockbusters, even ones which are better than this), but it falls down in areas where a film should be strong whatever genre it is and whatever demographic it serves (in the case of Pacific Rim I suspect that is 11-year-old boys).The characters struggle even to be two-dimensional, the 'plot' and it's explanation is a tad too simplistic even for a blockbuster, the dialogue is horribly predictable and the 'fight' scenes all go on just a little too long. In a way it's as though del Toro got a Build Your Own Blockbuster kit for Christmas and put it all together without really consulting the manual. I, for one, wanted to know more about the Kaju, the monsters from deep who are destroying the world. What were they? Where did they come from? Did they agree with Obamacare or did they (rather more probably given how fierce and unremitting they were to destroy all before them) incline more to the Tea Party? That kind of thing.Then there were the jaegers, the monstrously large robots humankind had developed to kill them: how come, for example, they didn't leak when under water? How were they powered? How come, what with all the technology we had at our disposal to design and build them in the first place, the best they can resort to when destroying a kaju is a heavy bout of fisticuffs and knocking six bells out of their kaju opponent? The problem with Pacific Rim is that del Toro comes up with some neat ideas, but then explores the wrong parts of them.Being a sci-fi offering, it is reasonably easy to buy into the notion that each jaeger has to be operated by two folk in tandem who have to 'share' their brains and memories. Hogwash, yes, but what they hell. But apart from telling us that that's the deal, del Toro doesn't bother developing the notion, which might well have offered fertile ground for invention. Where Pacific Rim does score is in special effects: they are very well done, though - back to griping mode - once you have seen one city obliterated by a kaju stomping through it, the wonder of it all does tend to fade rather quickly.I can't think director del Toro had much to do with bringing about the special effects other than writing his brief ('I want monsters that look like reptilian dinosaurs, but which emit an eery blue light from their throats. By Friday. Oh, and they must be Republican supporters or the young shavers watching this film just won't be persuaded') so whoever operated the PCs for the CGI and designed it all should get a cheer or two. But a film needs more than just neat CGI.The characters: the grizzled, dedicated leader who gives his life for mankind (Idris Elba), the pretty female aide who demonstrates she's as good as any boy (Rinko Kikuchi), Our Hero (Charlie Hunnam), the Oz father and son team (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky), the obligatory faux comedy double-act (Burn Gornam and Charlie Day) and a - very underused - criminal mastermind (Ron Perlman) have about as much life about them as your average stock comic book protagonist, but the actors say the corny lines they are given, always find their marks and generally don't disgrace themselves, even if none is a contender for this year's Oscars. All, I'm sure, would cope with more demanding material without any bother at all.So there you have it. If you like hamburgers, this most certainly looks the part of a hamburger and then some. If you actually want it to taste of hamburger, save Pacific Rim for another day. At the time of writing IMDb users have given this an average 7.4/10. Don't be fooled. I've seen a lot better, despite the CGI.",5,7,9,10 January 2014
American Sniper," Disgraceful, dishonest and offensive - one-dimensional twaddle
","Clint Eastwood's latest, American Sniper, presents this reviewer with a real quandary: if you buy into Eastwood's central premise that the SEALS, marines and other U.S. grunts who rampaged around Iraq in the second Coalition invasion imagining they were 'liberating' its people were justified in their mission and actions, and if you subscribe to the gungho simplistic notion of the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys', American Sniper does the business, though in a pretty pedestrian, run-of-the-mill manner (Eastwood won't win any awards for imaginative direction).If you don't buy into Eastwood's central premise - and I certainly don't - American Sniper is a disgraceful, offensive piece of garbage. I don't doubt that it might have tens of thousands of red-blooded young Yankees cheering on their man to the rafters and will have many a Vietnam and Iraq War vet wiping away a private tear in memory of fallen friends and comrades, and I can understand their reaction. (According to IMDb figures, American Sniper has already taken more then $217 million at the box office.) But that doesn't in any way redeem the film itself.Let me make it very clear that I believe it is the politicians, notably George W Bush, Dick Cheney, Tony Blair and their acolytes, who must be blamed for the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths, most of them civilian, which have resulted from the second Iraq War, not the men they sent there to do their dirty work, many of whom lost their lives and a great many more of whom lost limbs.They, as always throughout history, paid and are still paying the price of what often seems like one man's vanity - exactly why George Bush got it into his head that Iraq must be invaded and persuaded Britain's Tony Blair to support his plans was, is and will remain forever a mystery: no 'weapons of mass destruction were found' and Iraq's then dictator Saddam Hussein was not only not harbouring Al Qaeda, he was at daggers drawn with them.I didn't actually cotton on that Eastwood was this film's director until the credits rolled - the fact had simply eluded me until then. But had I done so, and going on past Eastwood efforts, I would have had second thoughts about sitting down to watch another of his efforts. Eastwood's alleged masterpiece Unforgiven is, in my view, anything but and merely a two-dimensional cowboy film brought up to day in which the transformation of a now peaceful, retired and more or less arthritic gunslinger and how he regains his rusty skills in about two and a half minutes is ludicrous.Even more ludicrous is the transformation in Gran Turino of a lifelong racist who hates Asians because of his wartime experiences virtually overnight into a caring, liberal do-gooder who'll give his life for one of them. In musical terms Eastwood is something of a two-chord merchant and neither chord is interesting.American Sniper is from the same stable and has even greater faults: what, exactly, is 'the story'? All we get is merely a series of gun battles, most of which are confusing in the extreme. The characterisation of Chris Kyle and his patient, though often despairing, wife are so rudimentary as to be non-existent. Why, exactly, did Kyle repeatedly volunteer for tours of duty and in doing so neglect his wife and two young children? Suggesting it was 'patriotism' might work in a primary school textbook, but otherwise will not wash - there is something more profound at work, but Eastwood's American Sniper suggests nothing.And why were Iraqis defending their country from what they saw as invading aggressors so vilified? They were only doing what each of those patriotic US servicemen would also do if Texas or New England, or Utah - or anywhere in the US - were invaded: they would defend their country, homes and family to the last man.Yet when Iraqis do it they are 'bad' and 'savages'. Give me a break! Doesn't it occur to Eastwood and his assorted cheerleaders that every country in the world believes itself to be 'the best'? I don't for a second deny anyone - not least the Americans - the patriotic pride they feel (thought it does stick in my craw that the rest of us are by default expected to share that pride and equally vilified if we don't), but they must allow folk from other nations to feel the same pride. Those are two more reasons why Eastwood's American Sniper is disgraceful, offensive garbage and dishonest to boot.Whether or not you rate the film will most certainly depend on what your take is on the second Iraq War, and having read what I have to say you might disagree entirely with the points I make. But be warned: if you don't disagree with me, then give this film a miss. You will get nothing from it but anger and supreme irritation.(I have given this a 4/10 and not a lesser mark merely because technically American Sniper stands up. For content it would get 0/10.)",4,17,39,31 January 2015
The Godfather: Part II," The rotten core at the centre of this well-made film
","What exactly are we talking about when we amateur critics write these reviews? What exactly is 'a film'? Certainly it is more than technical ability. It is more than just the acting, or the directing, or the story. It is everything which makes up that film. So The Godfather II (as did the first The Godfather) presents us all with something of a dilemma. It was made in the early Seventies when, possibly, the public, though not the police and the FBI, were largely unaware of the reality of the Mafia. The yellow press (called the red tops here in the UK) gave them unlimited publicity, and even when we were shown pictures of the bullet-riddled bodies of bosses lying outside barbershops and restaurants, there was a certain thrill about it all. Then came The Sopranos, whose central conceit of a Mafia head of a family suffering from panic attacks was more or less the keynote to a certain disrespect of the whole shooting match, and the public's view is different. We now see the Mafia for what it they are: nasty, brutish, cynical, heartless, sadistic thugs with, it would seem, no redeeming features. Forget all that talk of 'honour' and 'loyalty', these men, and the women who tolerated their brutality and were quite happy to live off its proceeds, were and are scum. So what to make of films such as the Godfather series? They are extremely well-made, well-written, well-directed, well-acted, well-designed and they stand head and shoulders above their peers. But in an odd sort of way, these films are thoroughly devalued by the central lie they tell. Vito Corleone and his son Michael are portrayed as honourable men, wise men, men to be admired. They are almost portrayed, in their convoluted heroism, as honest men. But they are nothing of the kind. They are brutal and murderous and do not deserve to be admired. The men in The Sopranos apparently came far closer to portraying the real mafiosi. Indeed real mafiosi are widely quoted as saying as much. So why did Coppola choose to present them as something close to heroes? And that brings me back to my first question and the very real dilemma faced by someone making a judgement of these very well-made films: as the portrayal of what is basically scum as honourable men is so central to Coppola's films, where does that leave the films? I really have no answer. As a piece of entertainment, of course, the Godfather films are superb. But once you consider the wider context, the butchery, the misery, the killing, the heroin dealing, the pimping, the whoring, you do have to wonder. As film-making this would get 8/9 our of 10. But given the corrupt moral ambiguity at its centre, only a 5.",5,5,16,1 June 2009
The Aviator," Nicely filmed biopic and a tad disappointing. Where's the drama?
","I wouldn't be at all surprised that in some of the more liberal US states it is a capital offence to criticise Martin Scorsese. I mean, surely if is one of God's truths that he makes fine movies and couldn't make a dud if he tried? Well, unfortunately for all its fine acting, high value production, soundtrack, atmosphere and, not least, special effects, with The Aviator Marty is, in this man's humble opinion, skating on rather thin ice. One of the many questions which presented themselves to me and which wouldn't go away was: what was the point of The Aviator? It isn't a drama, we already know the story of Howard Hughes's life, there are, apparently, no great revelations, it is not a left-field re-interpretation, in fact, at the end of the day it is simply just another, although extremely well-made biopic. So why was it made? More than that, it is also a tad confusing. Purporting to show Hughes' life between the early Thirties and the late Forties, it apparently takes some liberties with chronology. It also takes quite a few liberties with the facts: why, for example, the emphasis on Katherine Hepburn (with whom he lived) when by all accounts she was just one of several hundred of his sexual conquests? And why was not mention made of the fact that Hughes' bi-sexuality was also no secrets. He wasn't just seducing many of the starlets but also many of the stars. The Aviator also seems - and I must emphasise that word 'seems' - rather badly put together. No doubt Scorsese shot far more film than he needed and tried to shape his movie in the cutting room. Unfortunately, that means there are too many loose ends and quite a few mystifying cameos. Willem Dafoe appears briefly as, I think, a journalist, and is then never seen or alluded to again. Was his part bigger in the script, but cut later on? Who knows? Many other promising characters are introduced, never to appear again. There's Errol Flynn (having a fight), reputedly another of Hughes's sexual conquest, Spencer Tracy makes a brief, and very oblique appearance. There is something curiously two-dimensional about The Aviator, largely because it lacks any kind of drama and because the details of Hughes's life are already well-known. So why did Scorsese make this film. I don't know. Finally, Leonard Di Caprio plays a blinder, and in the later scenes bears an uncanny resemblance to the real Hughes. Unfortunately, this viewer could not once suspend disbelief: it was always Di Caprio up there on the screen acting well. Which is not really that good a thing. Two cheers for Scorsese's effort. Elsewhere this is called a masterpiece and a great American tragedy. No, it's not. Sorry. For that you'll have to look elsewhere.",4,1,3,30 May 2009
Burn After Reading," Where is the X factor? Well, don't ask the Coens.
","Why, I always ask myself after watching a Coen brothers film, can't I seem to warm to Ethan and Joel? After all, they make better films than many working in Hollywood, they are respected enough for the crème de la crème of Hollywood actors to appear in their work again and again, and they are capable of working successfully in different genres. Yet still I find them and their films just a tad irritating. It's partly, I think, because every time I think of them and their work, I have a mental image of the two of them writing their scripts and chortling away, patting themselves on the back and telling each other how great they are. Now, I'm certain that has never happened and that Joel and Ethan are as modest as a row of peas. And yet Getting away from sheer gut feeling and into more intellectually-based criticism, the Coens remind me of that phrase of 'art which conceals art' although that is not the phrase which would describe their work. Quite the contrary: it is their inability to find the secret of concealing their art which is, I think, why however good they have been so far, they have never so far been great. There is also a certain heartlessness about their work which I find unappealing. I first thought that after watching Fargo. Everyone said what a funny film it was. All I felt was how despicable it was to make the utterly inept William Macy character such a figure of fun. The man deserved our sympathy not our ridicule. Despite what he did, he was not essentially a bad man. The same is true of many of their other films: there is a certain lack of humanity in their work which is alienating, or rather which alienates this viewer. In Blood Simple, the first of their films I saw, none of the characters in the least bit attractive. (When I first saw Blood Simple, I thought it was superb. When I saw it again more than 20 years later, I thought it was well-made but mechanical and certainly not brilliant. When I first saw Miller's Crossing I thought it was great. When I saw it again, I admired it as a piece of film-making, but it didn't seem half as 'great' the second time around) I have not seen all of their films, but that word 'mechanical' sums up the Coen brothers' work rather well. In detail – the scriptwriting, the direction, the cinematography, the sound design – the Coens produce great work. But there is a certain mechanical quality to it all, so that all too often the sum of the parts exceeds the whole. So with Burn After Reading. Great, silly plot, great acting, great cinematography, quite a few laughs, but at the end of the day you find yourself admiring a well-made film rather than enjoying a great film. And oddly, in other hands I suspect Burn, which is essentially nothing but a screwball comedy, could have been great. Every member of the cast gives a good performance, and the film keeps you guessing as to how it will be resolved. Actually, nothing is resolved but in context that doesn't really matter. But something is lacking. I can't put my finger on it, but there is a definite lack of something. Perhaps the Coens might consider writing scripts and then letting others produce and direct. Unlikely, but it's worth considering.",6,0,1,14 June 2010
The Village," Thoroughly entertaining but by no means a masterpiece
","The various reviews of The Village by IMDb members follow the usual - and I am bound to say, rather unchivalrously - American pattern: it seems this is regarded either as a work of quite unparallelled genius (as in 'this week's work of quite unparallelled genius') or it stinks so much to heaven that it's a wonder the writer, director and chief bottle washer dares show his face in public. But that's the Americans for you: never like to do anything by halves. This rather reserved - Americans might say buttoned up, but they would be wrong - Brit thinks The Village is a rather entertaining, well-made horror flick, but which, at the end of the day, pulls is punches. In hindsight, the plot is so full of holes, if it were a fishing net, a shark would have no trouble escaping. But that is in hindsight: while you are watching, from the spooky opening funeral to the final scene, its rather good, very entertaining, will quite often send a pleasant chill down your spine and will keep you guessing right until the end. It is, in fact, a difficult film to write about because revealing only one of the plot twists would rather spoil the viewing of someone who is seeing it for the first time. So just let me repeat: there are twists aplenty and anyone who knows where it will all end at any point is a better man than I am. The saintly Roger Ebert gave it a very sniffy review when it was first released in 2004, and although I understand the points he raise, his judgement does seem unnecessarily stern. (And his judgement might well be questioned by asking just how much attention he was paying. He did, after all, get one plot point very wrong. The village idiot was the heroine's brother, not just some unrelated village idiot.) Certainly, this has more in common with a shaggy dog story than Macbeth, but then who says that is a crime. Look, I'm struggling to describe this film without giving anything away. Every time I think of a point, I realise that making it might ruin the film for the first-time viewer. So just let me end by saying that everyone from Joaquin Phoenix through Ron Howard's daughter to William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver acquits themselves well, Roger Deakins photography is, as usual, great, and even if the film does, in a way, cheat by (at least to this viewer) by making out it is raising a few quite interesting moral points, only to drop them one by one unceremoniously without a second thought, you could do a lot worse than spend 103 minutes watching The Village. Expect a solid piece of entertainment, not a masterpiece.",6,4,6,2 October 2008
21," Less interesting than a bowl of soggy cornflakes. Only for the terminably bored
","Are we allowed to write reviews of films which became so mind-numbingly dull and predictable that we didn't even watch until the end? I don't know. Perhaps someone from IMDb should publish a definitive protocol. But 21 was just such a film. I didn't actually walk out of the cinema early because I was at home watching it on DVD. But I really had neither the patience nor the heart to carry on with this formulaic drivel. Yes, I know that the US market it so big that even drivel can recoup its costs and then - hopefully - some. But don't be fooled. If you are inclined to prefer safe, boring, predictable films with the usual content, the usual characters, the usual 'dilemmas', the usual dialogue, the usual clichés, the usual plots and the usual plot devices, this is for you. Otherwise save your money, whether this is showing at you nearest fleapit or 'on offer' at your local supermarket. Save your money and buy a decent DVD instead. Incidentally, Kevin Spacey, rather good in The Usual Suspects and Beyond The Sea, has a habit of picking the occasional clunker. So don't even bother because our Kev is involved. Avoid this b*ll*cks.",2,2,2,14 May 2010
The Revenant," Great on style, not quite so great on content
","I feel a bit like a party pooper, especially as The Revenant was deemed worthy of three Oscars, but I was underwhelmed by the film and not even slightly. There's no denying that visually it is a feast, and the well-known scene where Leonardo DiCaprio is attacked and mutilated by a grizzly bear is an cinematic accomplishment all of its own.It's hard to believe – although given the CGI expertise about it shouldn't be – that the scene is entirely and utterly fake: the wood in which it takes place is made up entirely of 'rubber' tree props, the 'bear' is a stuntman in a blue CGI suit and DiCaprio is attached to several harnesses to allow him to seem thrown about by the bear. Which is all fine and dandy and makes for a thrilling experience. But it also leads to questions about Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's reported insistence that his troupe of actors should all go through a week's boot camp so that they get to know and understand the hardship the characters they play suffered and also look the part when it comes to filming.Now, call me an old cynic but that – the reported week in boot camp – is entirely the kind of story the studio press department would like to get out there to drum up a bit of interest, for which read money before the premiere. 'Look,' the story tells us, 'this is the real deal, this is acting really suffering for their art, this is serious filmmaking' with the subtext 'this film is one you really won't want to miss because it is special.' Yes, but is it really?Although Inarritu lost out on the Best Director Oscar, his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki was luckier and grabbed one of the little fellers for is camera-work. And apparently Lubezki wanted to work with only natural lighting and eschew artificial lighting so much that filming lasted at most four hours a day.Well, for this old cynic it reakkt doesn't quite stack up, and that snippet of news – as well as other stories 'leaking out' that filming was 'so tough' hardened crew simply walked out of the production in protest – most certainly didn't do pre-publicity for the film (and whisper it quietly, the film's Oscar chances) any harm at all. So what of the film? Well, what of it? What is it about? Superficially, it is at tale of survival against all odds. Our mutilated hero, DiCaprio, is left for dead by two men charged with taking care of him – though the younger man is far less culpable than the nasty old Texan played by Britain's Tom Hardy – yet despite his wounds, despite being at death's door for quite some time, despite plunging into icy-cold water several times, despite his skin 'dying' (which I suppose is gangrene), despite being chased be Native Americans, despite riding over a cliff and plunging several hundred feet – despite it, all dear reader, our intrepid hero manages to find his way back to civilisation after almost two months – it is never clear just how long it took - in. Once there, he is not a bit puffed and then sets about chasing down nasty old Tom Hardy and has enough energy to pretty much kill him. (He doesn't actually do the deed - he remembers the wise old words of a Native American who befriends him on the way and leaves the dirty deed that to an troop of Native Americans who also want him dead). And then he dies. Fancy! What a man!Well, I was pretty underwhelmed. I was underwhelmed by the lack of a story, I was underwhelmed by a vague kind of mysticism which permeated the story but which really made little sense at all, I was baffled by the intermittent appearance of a gang of French trappers, I was underwhelmed by the gang of Native Americans whose chief is looking for his daughter, and I was underwhelmed by the film's insistence that a man who was barely alive and could, at first, only crawl everywhere, who ate hardly anything but roots and shoots should still find the energy and resolve to survive hyperthermia finally to get up and walk (and after his supposed exertions) appear to have lost very little weight).Am I being unfair? Well, only if the whole film had not been pitched as 'this is something entirely different – this is real!' At the end of the day it is in many ways an entirely impressive piece of filmmaking but in many other ways it cuts to many corners to be taken completely seriously. For style it gets pretty much top marks, but sadly loses quite badly on content.",6,3,3,28 May 2017
Quantum of Solace," More of the same only 21st century style. At least it tries hard
","It's always difficult to know what to think about the James Bond franchise, and I must admit that after watching the late Sean Connery films, I rather lost interest. They became something of an institution here in Britain, with the TV companies showing several over Christmas and that sort of thing and a grateful nation was expected to murmur its thanks, and I believe they even did so. I have to say, they never did anything for me. The jokey puns were always a little to obvious for my taste, the 'humour' never very funny, the plots rapidly became clichéd and once you've seen one chase and a set of implausible gadgets, you've seen them all. When Daniel Craig took over the helm as 007, much was made in the Press, courtesy of the Broccoli marketing department, no doubt, how this would be a new, darker, less sexist Bond. And the women are now much more capable. They are no longer eye candy and easy sex for James. Judi Dench's M is a case in point and puts more than a little backbone into the female roles. Some claim that the new, improved Bond has somehow lost the essence, And having seen Casino Royale and now Quantum Of Solace I can see why. What with the Bourne franchise breathing down its neck, the Bond franchise was very much obliged to up its game and give the punter more of what the modern punter wants. In the process of this necessary modernisation, James has lost his sense of humour, is now 'caringly' sexist and no longer smokes - well, what with all the running, chasing, fighting and swimming, it would be suicide to do so. Gone, too, are the gadgets, or rather they are far more underplayed. The ability of MI6 to keep in touch with 007 is phenomenal - they can supply him with data, background info, oh, all sorts - this is a world where budgetary constraints are unheard of - but Bond himself, apart from his snazzy mobile, doesn't have many gadgets. But beneath it all, beneath this year's fashionable themes, attitudes and context, it's the same old 007 stories, the same old franchise, the same old highly fanciful plots and story lines, the same utter disregard for the lives of those not involved in any way with the plot, the same old unbelievable luck Bond's has - keys are always waiting for him in cars, speedboats are always available when he needs them, and in Quantum he has ready access to money, weapons and ammunition and can move about the world as easily as a virus. Lord, he even manages to hire a rather large turbo-prop plane which is sitting, rather conveniently, in the middle of the Bolivian desert. And exactly where did he get the 4x4 in the last few minutes of the Bolivian section when the hotel is incinerated (presumably with all its staff)? And when does a man with such a fine physique find the time to work out when he is obliged to chase around the world? And why does he never get jet-lagged? (Incidentally, Judi Dench's M, who introduces are rather sardonic line in humour, is also a very hands-on boss, in this film even ending up in 'Kazan', Russia, which for the head of Her Majesty's Most Secret Service is surely quite unprecedented. Quantum itself is full of huge implausibilites. Why do the conspirators all meet in the Austrian opera house, are given earpieces and hold some sort of conference. Well, only because it is a great set for a Bond set piece - for no other reason. Oh, why be so longwinded. Criticisng Bond is as pointless as detailing why it is impossible for Sante even to exist, let alone run a toy factory in the North Pole. All I'm saying is that if like most people you have a soft spot for the Bond films, Quantum as its predecessor Casino Royale, hits the spot and will give you what you crave, with the bonus that computer graphics mean even snazzier special effects. Me? Well, I was never a convert, and Quantum did nothing to change that. I'm not particularly stupid, but for much of the film I had little idea what was going on or why. Who was Mathis? How did Bond know Mathis? Why was Mathis beaten to death? Does it even matter? Well, no it doesn't. The Bond films are rather like Doctor Who: you accept them on their own terms and completely or you go and find something else to do. I'll probably watch the next one if the DVD comes my way, but I shan't be holding my breath.",5,2,5,17 October 2009
Meet the Fockers," Undemanding fodder redeemed by good performances
","Folks in the U.S. are apparently more sentimental than we hardier Euro types, or at least that's what Hollywood believes. So meet the Fockers has the obligatory feelgood ending when each and every loose end is neatly tied up in the final ten minutes (or it could have been eleven) and for this viewer rather left a rather artificial sugary taste to what at times was a quite inspired film. I must admit that I haven't seen the prequel Meet The Parents so I cannot say whether or not this is better, worse, as good as or as bad as that film. What I can say is that when Meet The Fockers scores, which it does do every so often, it is invariably the achievement of the five main characters. In other hands a pretty ordinary script might otherwise have made a truly dreadful film. Hoffman and Streisand in particular gell nicely as the quirky, hippy parents who son Ben Stiller loves but who he worries about so much when tight-arsed Jack is around. One nice touch was Dina, Jack's wife, who is shown to be a woman in her own right though a long-suffering wife. Overall this is par for the course, a standard Tinseltown comedy and its moments and occasional good jokes are down to the cast. Don't expect a great deal and you won't be disappointed. You'll get what this was always intended to be, undemanding fodder with a few laughs.",6,1,2,10 September 2009
The Transporter," Hamlet it ain't but of its - very limited kind - better than many
","Films such as Transporter (and, I should imagine, Transporter 2 and Transporter 3 unless there has been a dramatic change of heart by their producers) highlight one of the dilemmas of IMDBs user ratings system. All the films I come across here have, without exception, been given the 8/10 and 9/10 ratings which only the truly devoted award. And each of of those films has also earned the very pitiful 1/10 and 2/10 ratings.On the one hand, praise such as 'awesome, dude, truly awesome' and 'real genius, dude, this is the real sh*t' are bandied about like beer at a truckers convention, on the other those same films get also '90 minutes out of my life I'll NEVER get back!!!', 'this SUCKED big time, man!!!' and 'this would get 0/10 if the system allowed it' from other, less enchanted viewers. All that is only to be expected and - cliché alert - wouldn't the world be a duller place if we all thought the same. But what do you do when you see a well-made, entertaining piece of complete schlock which stands head and shoulders about its peer films and then a well-made, very moving and thoughtful film which is unlike the schlock as cheese is to chalk? In all honesty there can be no comparison, yet both deserve a high rating.Of its kind, Transporter does stand out. But it does so without characterisations and plot entirely. What vague storyline there is simply the help the hero, in this case Jason Statham, roar from one fight to the next. In in Transporter's case it works. Why, I have no idea. Certainly, the producers hired good talent, not least Luc Besson who has latterly made this kind of film his stock in trade. A great deal about this film boasts 'class', except, it has to be said, the film itself. But the point is it doesn't matter. You don't go to your neighbourhood hamburger joint and expect haut cuisine and you would be thought of as dim-witted if you then criticised the joint for not reaching haut cuisine standards.So those who like this kind of thing, the Transporter movie will get their money's worth and then some. And it would be futile, not to say ineffably silly, to criticise Transporter for being utterly and ludicrously over the top. Because, of course, it is meant to be utterly and ludicrously over the top. It succeeds and stands out for several reasons. One is Jason Statham, the Transporter. I like Jason. I have now seen him in three films and I'm on his side. If Jason gets through his day job by not taking it seriously, he doesn't show it. But nor does he give the impression of believing himself to be 'an artist'. He has a certain quality about him which, if not unique, is rare. He knows what he can do and, presumably, what he can't do, and doesn't pretend. With Jason you feel what you see is what you get. And I like that. I could, of course, be completely wrong, but somehow I don't think so, and it is that certain honesty which comes across on camera and helps to raise what is at heart pretty mediocre material rather higher. Jason gives value for money. If Jason flipped hamburgers, you could be pretty sure they would be stand-out, top-dollar hamburgers. And it is that quality which carries the film as far as I am concerned.In another's hands the role he takes would go bear-shaped quite soon (although that is not to say there aren't other men about with the same quality as Jason. There are other 'hard men' out their - Vin Diesel and Steven Seagal, although I haven't seen a film by either - but I doubt whether any of the others would carry it off as Jason does. So there you have it: Transporter is not The Merchant Of Venice, On Golden Pond, ET, Schindler's List, The Godfather or any of the other films which get consistently good ratings. It is just another macho piece of b******s. The important difference is that, of its kind, it is rather more impressive (in that way rather like anther Luc Besson scripted film, District 13). Hence my high rating.",Null,4,5,19 November 2011
28 Days Later...," Rather good for the kind of film it is
","Taken on its own terms, 28 Days Later isn't half bad. As a zombie movie it gets far better than half marks compared with some of the formulaic pap that is out there. In many ways the filming is rather rough around the edges, but given that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by some sort of virus, that isn't half bad. There are plot holes galore and some very inconsistent behaviour by the main characters, but then I did stress that the film does oblige you to take it on its own terms and as long as you are not looking forward to an intelligent piece, analysing, say, the breakdown of society as seen through the eyes of some would be auteur, your on safe ground. In some ways the film is in two halves, with the second half when three of the characters reach apparent safety, only for the women to find that they are anything but safe, promising something over an above your average zombie movie. However, that promise is not fulfilled which is rather a pity. Director Danny Boyle does well on very limited resources (your average Tinseltown zombie movie will have a budget ten, twenty times what Boyle had) and the opening scenes in an apparently utterly deserted London are impressive given that the locations are real and that Boyle had to clear the streets of London completely for each shot. I have to say the desertion and desolation of New York city in I Am Legend is superficially more impressive given that film's greater resources (both films cover much the same ground, in fact), but the sheer bleakness of an un-digitally created deserted London carries additional weight. I'll stress, taken on its own terms Boyle's effort is rather entertaining, better than many glossier attempts. You have to take the story and characters on trust and suspend your disbelief, but then All's Well That Ends Well demands a similar commitment, so that is no great shakes. Just switch off and enjoy.",6,0,0,18 July 2009
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Essentially just another blockbuster with impressive effects
","A film such as this – essentially another summer blockbuster – must be taken on its own terms and on those terms is is rather impressive. But please ignore all claims along the lines that this film 'examines our relationship with blah-blah' or any other such blarney. Lined up against other blockbusters Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes stands tall, mainly, of course, because of its impressive CGI effects. Judged on other criteria, though, it is pretty much standard hokum. Still, go along and enjoy it, but don't read too much into it. There is precious little characterisation, hardly any 'plot' or story and the characters are, at best, two-dimensional, with the standard bad guys and the standard rather misunderstood good guys. But on its own terms it does the biz and then some. Someone else reviewing it here has described it as a 'masterpiece'. Not quite, and don't fall for it. Great popcorn-munching fodder but not much else.",6,4,6,20 July 2014
JFK," As a film, OK. As serious analysis a tad dodgy. Always remember that this is fiction
","There's the truth about why John Kennedy was assassinated and by whom and then there's Oliver Stone's epic JFK. It is generally, although not universally, accepted that Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed a 'patsy' and set up to take the wrap, and that the Warren Commission and its report were a rather hamfisted whitewash. But that is about all we can safely allow ourselves to believe to know, and everything else is still as clear as mud. The problem with Stone's JFK is that it is first and foremost a fiction, with fictional elements which, although intended to demonstrate a higher 'dramatic' truth, are still made up, invented, constructed. For all I know the thesis of the film is wholly accurate (although one website in particular has dedicated itself to debunking much of Stone's film). On the other hand it might well be wholly inaccurate, and it doesn't seem that we will be able to know definitively one way or the other any time soon. But when considering Stone's film JFK, the one thing we must never forget is that it is a fiction and furthermore, given the nature of Hollywood filmmaking, one produced for commercial gain. So, for example, it includes several wholly fictional characters, of which the gay hustler Willie O'Keeffe and the assistant DA Bill Bruissard are just two and severa wholly fictional scenes.Yet many people – in fact, a great many people – will have walked out of the cinema after watching JFK believing that the Kennedy murder mystery has finally been solved, that the conspiracy was, in the words of the film's DA Jim Garrison, nothing less than a coup d'etat backed by the military industrial complex of the US which saw Kennedy as bad for business. According to Stone's film that coup d'etat and the assassination conspiracy were achieved with the backing of the CIA, the FBI and Dallas' police department. And, what is even more alarming is that, given the potency of film, Stone's – fictional - account might well in time become the accepted and definitive account. But I'll repeat: we have no way of knowing how much or how little of it is true or even close to true.By chance I have been reading another analysis of the assassination by the British writer Anthony Summers (and was thus already familiar with many of the names of the whole affair's protagonists). Summer's book is not a work of fiction but attempts to sift through the confusion of fact and evidence surrounding Oswald. Although Summers is at pains to avoid being seen to 'solve the case' and states that his objective is simply to lay out the evidence as we know it, his book does suggest strongly that there was Mafia involvement in Kennedy's murder and, even more so that, of anti-Castro Cuban exiles. In this writer's view, assassination by Cuban exiles with the assistance of the Mafia (who hated Kennedy and his brother Robert) and rather a lot of rogue elements in the CIA and FBI, strikes me as being a great deal more plausible than the man being bumped of by his own side, not least of whom was the man who succeeded Kennedy as president (and who apparently reversed Kennedy's policy to pull out of Vietnam and instead escalated US involvement in the conflict. Yet that, very plausible and well-documented aspect of the assassination is not even hinted at in Stone's film. There is not a whisper of Cuban exiles, despite Oswald's well-known dealings with them. Summers agrees that there was a great deal of very odd CIA, FBI and Dallas police department behaviour, but does not suggest that this was official policy (rather, he believes that official stubbornness which covered up a great deal of odd behaviour by the security forces stemmed from a proud esprit de corps, my side right or wrong) at no point does anything he writes suggest that a coup d'etat lay at the core of the assassination.That, on the other hand, lies at the heart of Stone's film, and the meeting between Garrison and the mysterious Mr X (a disillusioned high-up soldier who claimed he ran a black ops unit) is pivotal. So what is it? Who's right? Your guess is as good as mine. But don't take Stone's film as the gospel truth. If you decide to see it (by now most probably in DVD) always bear in mind that this is a fictional work of art, and that Stone is on record as having his own agenda.But what of JFK as a film? Well, if it is possible to divorce the 'film' from its contentious subject matter – which is, of course, almost impossible – then JFK should get very good marks indeed. It is well-shot, well-acted, well-edited and well-imagined. Had it dealt with some other assassination, and one which was not as central to a sensitive American psyche, it would be top-notch. As it is  well until and when JFK can be views with a little more objectivity, it is almost impossible to judge.Remember: this is a fictional piece of art. It isn't The Truth, irrespective of how close or how far from The Truth it actually might be.",7,1,9,28 May 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The latest in a long, long line of Tarnatino clunkers. Baffling - why was it made?
","First of all a fact: IMDb reports that Tarantino's latest (as of January 6, 2020, when I am writing this review) cost an estimated $90 million and recouped almost half that in its opening US weekend ($41 million). Released six months ago, it has already grossed $141 million in the US and Â£372.5 million worldwide. There will be more moolah to come, and even more once it is released on video. So there's just one reason why Tinseltown's moneymen will gladly finance any old hooey that Tarantino wants to produce: the returns are fabulous, and we all know that at the end of the day we must ignore all the bull about 'an important new film', 'artistic integrity' and I don't know what else and just listen to the sound of the only thing that counts, continual ringing of the till.I liked Tarantino's first 'breakthrough' film, Reservoir Dogs, and I liked Pulp Fiction. Both were in their own way originals. Jackie Brown was also quite good, though I suspect that was more down to Elmore Leonard's story than Tarantino's filmmaking. But since then? Dear soul, what is going on? But while he sucks in the readies, Tinseltown doesn't care.Tinseltown doesn't care in the slightest that Tarantino cannot for the life of himself, or rather seems to have forgotten how to, pace a film. He can write the occasional good line, but a good line here and there can't and doesn't excuse some of the mish-mash dreck he has been coming out with for quite a few years.Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight and now this, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood are simply not very good at all. Certainly far worse films have been made and will be made, but far better films have been made, too. But not by Tarantino. But - I repeat - no one in Hollywood is going to argue with the simple fact with which I began this review: he makes very, very good money for folk who seem to be interested in little else.What, specifically, to make of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood? It is certainly well-made, though that might be more to the credit of Tarantino's producers, but many TV commercials are superbly produced. And everything else about is confusing to pointless to incomprehensible. Essentially the obvious question is: just why did Tarantino bother? Why?When it was released media reviews spoke (in that arch way reviewers have when confronted by yet another clunker by a former wunderkind and they haven't quite got the stomach to say so) of 'Tarantino's love letter to Hollywood', that 'Tarantino pays tribute to filmmaking' and more along those lines. Well, Quentin darling, every thought of making a documentary instead? Why waste your time - and not least our time - with this kind of self-indulgent bull?What is it about? By my reckoning - the 'action' takes up the final 30 minutes of a very long film - something like nine-tenths of the film is redundant, utterly superfluous, pointless: so why include them.Why rewrite the whole Manson family murder tragedy? What was the point? Was there a point? Tarantino must have had something in mind because it certainly isn't entertaining.There are two saving graces to this film: Brad Pitt and Leonardo Di Caprio. Both can add polish to the biggest turd. As for the other actors, well, they just had nothing at all to do. Zilch.So there you have it, another horrible, well-made, pointless clunker from Tarantino. But there will be more, don't worry, as many as he can make will he carries on turning dross into dollars.",1,6,14,6 January 2020
Gone Girl," Hokum, perhaps, but great, top-class hokum - you won't regret it
","Gone Girl is simply to be enjoyed. Yes, there are plot holes and oddities, some of which occur to you even while you are watching the film, many more once you have finished (I was particular bemused by the state Amy is allowed to go home in - she is still covered head to toe in the blood spattered all over her when she killed the rich former boyfriend).But what the hell: if a film can be honest, Gone Girl is honest and doesn't take itself too seriously. It is an unashamed teasing thriller with enough twists and turns to satisfy most people, so give it a whirl. There are no deep insights into marriage, relationships or sociopathy, there's just a cracking good film which should entertain you and then some. If you are looking for a more 'serious' film, look elsewhere.If you will settle for a great thriller, with great performances and a sinewy storyline, this is for you, plot holes and all.",7,0,2,22 February 2015
Django Unchained," If you thought Inglourious Basterds was bad... This is camp crap which gets worse and worse
","Tarantino's latest, Django Unchained, reminds those of us - well, those of you - who had, perhaps, forgotten that at the end of the day cinema is essentially about making a fast buck by getting as many bums on seats as you can before you flog off the DVD rights. Certainly individual directors, actors and producers like to be involved in something which is a little less like selling your arse to the highest bidder, but when the chips are down making a mountain of moolah, and then some, is the name of the game. That is the only way I can explain the abysmal, insulting mess that is Django Unchained.If you thought Inglourious Basterds - whose USP was the existence of a vastly successful Jewish death squad sticking it to the Nazis in occupied France - was as bad as I did, Django Unchained won't persuade you that Tarantino has regained his touch. In fact, with notable exceptions, for example Jackie Brown, you find yourself wondering whether he actually did have a touch in the first place and whether perhaps it was more beginner's luck.Tarantino's latest, I read somewhere, is a paean to B movies, and from the cheesy music to the the sudden close-up zoom he uses you can see that the man did, perhaps, have something like that in mind. So the obvious question is: why on earth bother? Is a meal of greasy, second-rate badly cooked food any better if you declare it is a paean to fast food? Why on earth did Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio, Morgan Freeman and Jamie Foxx allow themselves to become involved in these campest of drearily camp capers? What was Tarantino trying to do? I ask because it really isn't obvious.At times his film comes across as a comedy (although the scene of the Ku Klux Klan complaining that they can't see where they are going because the eyeholes cut out of the white bags they are wearing won't let them is about as funny as a wet day in Dudley. Oh, and the Klan weren't even founded until seven years after the events of this film are said to take place. That kind of sloppiness permeates the film. There's also an inexplicable scene set in bright sunshine although we are supposed to be in winter, and the previous and subsequent scenes show deep, deep snow. And where did those snow-capped mountains come from in Texas?).The first hour is reasonably intriguing but then the decline sets in and the final scene is so ludicrously bad, you forget that earlier the film had to a certain extent held your interest, if only out of some vague curiosity as to where it was all heading.The blood flows with abandon, of course, and although it is gratuitous, it is no worse than other films (for example, a scene in The Cabin In The Woods). But not for the first time I have wondered about Tarantino's sexual psyche: he does seem to emphasise pain and gore a great deal. Is that perhaps how he gets his sexual jollies? But what the hell. This film will probably clear up at the box office because there is a sufficient number of idiots out there who are willing to sit through dross like this. But my advice to anyone who considering giving this a whirl is: don't bother.This so far has an average rating of 8.7. Don't let that fool you. It is terrible.",1,70,128,12 January 2013
Velvet Goldmine," Glam, glam, glam but not much of a centre. More one for gays
","This is the second review I've written, but it won't differ essentially from what I wrote in the first, which was that Velvet Goldmine seems to me more a film for gays and something of a gay manifesto more than anything else. That is not to criticise the film particularly or to denigrate it, just to suggest that in many ways I suspect homosexual men (and perhaps women) will gain more from it than heterosexuals. And I suspect what one takes from the film will, in general, be very different depending upon one's sexual orientation. Although it was made in 1998, by which time the situation gay men and women in the Western world was somewhat easier than it had been ever before (I gather it's still pretty dire in Africa and other parts of the world), Velvet Goldmine strikes me as being a document of gay liberation presented in a manner which likes to see itself as rebellious. Perhaps that has to do with the age of the film's writer/director Todd Haynes, who has made gay proselytising his life's mission and who will have grown up when being gay was not as easy as it might be today. I am not gay, which under the circumstances, is relevant, so I think that should be taken into account in the following comments. It is difficult what to make of the film. It has been said that the central character, Brian Slade, and his career were based on David Bowie in his various incarnations, and Haynes makes a good fist of evoking the whole early Seventies glam rock scene when sexual ambiguity became for some just another fashion and a release for others. And if it is based on Bowie, who had several different pop personae just as Brian Slade had Maxwell Demon, the appearance right at the start of the film and then later on of a 'spaceship' at least has context, however spurious. But over and above that, that spaceship makes no sense and in many ways demonstrates what doesn't really work in Velvet Goldmine. There is a cryptic reference to Oscar Wilde (who was not a foundling as is suggested by the film) and some of his poetry, and some play is made of a sapphire tie pin (or something) which is said once to have belonged to Wilde and is then passed from gay character to gay character as some kind of talisman. All of this is, at worst, pretentious and, at best (which I think is a little more the case), merely rather muddled. And muddle seems to sum up Velvet Goldmine. It is patently not a fictionalised bio pic of Bowie and it is patently not just an account of the 'glam rock years'. For many minutes, interminably long minutes for this non-gay viewer, it is almost akin to gay soft porn, great for gays, I suppose, not so interesting for non-gays. For Haynes those scenes are, presumably, important for the film he is making, but in the overall arc they drag a rather. There is rather less cohesion than one would like, and, it has to be said, whether or not this is a specific gay film or even one primarily intended for a gay audience, Haynes is obliged to make a film which is, at some level, accessible to all. My problem is that there is quite a lot about Velvet Goldmine which isn't half bad, especially the performances by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Ewan McGregor (as a gay Iggy Pop type of character), Toni Collette, Eddie Izzard and Christian Bale. The pastiche glam rock songs are generally as good as the real thing, the era is evoked very well, and for stretches Velvet Goldmine is very entertaining. I should imagine it would be enjoyed especially by young lads who know they are gay but are battling with how to come out (my brother was one such, and as I love and like him a great deal, and my heart goes out to others like him who found and find themselves in that situation). In the Christian Bale character they will have a good role model. But on another level Velvet Goldmine is a confused mess, neither fish nor fowl, a film which meanders a great deal and doesn't quite make up it's mind what it is. On balance, however, I would recommend that it is worth watching, whether you are gay or straight, but don't necessarily expect to understand what the bloody hell is going on.",6,3,5,23 December 2010
The Lives of Others," Excellent (despite a curious flaw)
","The Lives Of Others is, more or less, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut and as such it is more than impressive. It speaks volumes that his cast, all well-established actors in Germany, agreed to work for a fifth of what they could normally expect to be paid. (It is, though, rather baffling that after the content and treatment of The Lives, von Donnersmarck's next project was the thoroughly entertaining but essentially super-lightweight The Tourist.) Others have criticised The Lives for giving a narrow portrayal of life in the former German Democratic Republic (always referred to in the Cold War years by the West Germans as 'die sogenannte DDR'), but that is a little unfair in that von D's film doesn't pretend but to give an insight into the lives of a very specific section of DDR society, the 'intellectual'. (Actually, my quote marks are superfluous as the Germans do, as a rule, take the life of the mind a damn sight more seriously than we Anglo-Saxons, although at times, to my tastes, a tad too seriously. But be that as it may.)The Lives takes place in the declining years of the DDR when, as usual, the tendency to corruption was absolute and, for example, a powerful party functionary and minister of culture can arbitrarily ruin the professional life of a well-known actress because he is piqued that she start an affair with him. Having raped her in his official limousine (with his ubiquitous driver still sitting in the front) didn't win him any brownie points, that's for sure. It is his lust for the actress which sets in trail the surveillance of her partner, a tame playwright and writer who despite the exhortations of his more radical friends to take a stand, has managed to continue to bask in the goodwill of the party without actually selling out. The minister of culture instructs his ambitious contact in the secret police to dig whatever dirt he can on the playwright in order to discredit him and smooth his path into the actress's favours. The contact, in turn, instructs an underling and nominal friend in the Stasi to bug the playwright's flat and keep him under surveillance. As that underling, in time, gets to hear more and more details of his target's life, he comes to realise what a nasty set up his socialist state and its masters have become. Finally, when he comes across exactly they kind of dirt he is tasked to find – the playwright has written an article for a West German news magazine about the soaring suicide rate in this particular workers' paradise – he decides not to report it and instead falsifies the records he keeps of his surveillance.I don't usually give a try to précis a plot, but I have done so here because it is a fascinating one which could have played out in any authoritarian state anywhere in the world and von Donnersmarck's German version is outstanding in its portrayal of how utterly intrusive the state apparatus was in everyone's life. But it has one small, but crucial flaw: its description of how the once proudly patriotic Stasi operative, who even lectures on interrogation techniques, slowly loses the faith is unconvincing. It happens to quickly. He is shown to be a lonely man with no outside interests, an unmarried man who hires prostitutes more for their company than for sexual gratification and who lives in a comfortable, though sparse and soulless flat in a soulless tower block. If anything the man as portrayed might be expected to become more rather than less zealous as a crude ploy to give his life the semblance of meaning.On paper it sounds fine, but the man's conversation into a 'good man' (ein guter Mensch) simply does not convince in von Donnersmarck's film. Such a radical change – from enthusiastic Stasi officer into more or less a traitor in the eyes of his colleagues – is so fundamental that it would have been a far more gradual process and taken years to come about. This is not how we see it in the film: apparently from one day to the next his patriotism goes AWOL, and his subsequent anti-state actions – hiding the typewriter on which the playwright wrote his contentious article and which could identify him - are simply logical consequences of that change of heart.I am now in danger of damning with faint praise, and I don't mean to do that. But for apart from what I regard as a flaw The Lives is excellent, not only as a film but as a production made on a comparative shoestring, and it deserves all the awards it garnered. If somehow it comes your way, take time to see it.",Null,5,6,22 November 2011
Good Will Hunting," A slight glibness is easily forgotten in what is often a moving film
","Here again is a film to which an extraordinary number of IMDb reviewers react with either jubilant enthusiasm as though it heralded the Second Coming or utter disdain as though all involved should be lined up against the nearest wall and shot. And neither reaction says anything at all useful about the film (or any other these others which elicit the same kind of response) but merely indicates yet again that a sense of proportion seems to elude a frightening number of people. Perhaps I am being too much of the buttoned-up Brit, but such extremes do nothing but gradually and surely devalue the credibility of contributors. In this reviewer's humble opinion Good Will Hunting has one or two forgivable flaws, but is overall an entertaining success. I suppose almost everyone here will know that back story of how two childhood friends and aspiring actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, were so fed up with getting nothing but bit gigs that they decided to write their own screenplay. In fact, their determination was such that once their agent had finally managed to find a buyer, they turned him down when they realised they would not have the degree of control over the production they wanted. And judging by what was finally made, they were right to hold out as they did. It would be easier to list what I regard as the few flaws first as they are minor and can be easily overlooked in what is otherwise an entertaining and often moving story. Damon is the tearaway from South Boston who is — this we have to accept as no proof is given — a mathematical genius with a photographic memory but who as an orphan who was regularly beaten by his stepfather finds it impossible to let go and allow someone to get close, in short who has a lamentably low self-esteem. Affleck is one of three childhood buddies with whom Damon likes nothing better than hanging out, getting drunk and getting into trouble with the police. Then there is Stellan Skarsgard as an MIT mathematics professor who discovers Damon's gift and tries to help him, in the process enlisting a college friend, Robin Williams's counsellor who can relate to Damon in that he has never been able to come to terms with the death from cancer of his wife several years earlier. The story is, in fact, quite simple: Williams does, in fact, finally manage to break through Damon's shell and Damon comes good. My slight gripe is that is is all a little glib, a little easy, a little like a textbook. In the real world the Damon character might be expected to be far more of a loner and far less sociable than he is portrayed. And Williams's success in getting through to Damon seems to encounter no setbacks — well, one ever so slight one — before Damon is 'healed' and takes off to claim the love of a good woman who also tried to help him. Given how entertaining the film is and, as I say, even quite moving, my gripes are perhaps a little harsh, for there is a great deal which is outstanding. Even though Damon and Affleck wrote the script, this is in no way a vanity project and it feel more like an ensemble production than anything else. Damon makes his character likable and sympathetic, and you root for him to come good (as, this being Hollywood, you always know he will). Williams shows once again that beneath the manic clown is a rather good actor (he was especially good with Al Pacino in the remake of Insomnia), and he, too, convinces as the psychologist (I think) who gains as much from his encounter with Damon as Damon does. Good Will Hunting is more than credible and the subsequent success of Damon and Affleck (and Casey Affleck, Ben's brother who plays another of the gang) shows this was no flash in the pan. From me it gets a seven.",7,1,3,6 July 2011
I Am Legend," Entertaining enough, so give it a shot
","There's nothing much wrong with I Am Legend despite the carping that it isn't as good as previous versions of the novel of the same title. It has to be said that Will Smith, who began his career as a lightweight is again rather good, and as he gets older and matures as an actor we might well be in for several more good performances. The outstanding feature of this version, courtesy of modern technology, of course, but then who cares, is its depiction of Manhattan as a wasteland in which only the birds, a herd of deer and a couple of lions are the sign of any significant life. How a herd of deer and lions end up in post-apocalypse Manhattan is not at all clear, but then, come one this is Hollywood. Hollywood can do these things. Next in the rather good things about I Am Legend comes Will Smith's performance which has to carry the film for almost all of its shortish running length, but this he does admirably. It is remarkable that just he, his dog and eventually an assortment of mutants star in the film for much of the time, but our interest keeps up and there is none of that quiet glancing at watches which is a sure indicator that not all is right with a film. When I Am Legend does finally develop and it becomes apparent that Will Smith is, after all, not the only human to have survived the onslaught of a badly virus which was supposed to eradicate cancer but instead eradicates 9/10s of the world's population, the film moves rather quickly to its ending, which - and I'm assuming the novel and its filmed versions all carried some kind of message - is one of hope. Along the way Smith copes with the mutants who have all been ravaged by the virus and who, for some reason, all develop superhuman strength, agility and aggression. We, the viewer, simply have to accept that, because no reason is given. At the end of the day, if one were to analyse I Am Legend, there is any number of incongruities. Where does the electricity supply come from, how come a woman and her son on their way from Brazil to Vermont detour via Manhattan, especially has we are earlier informed that all its bridges have been destroyed in an attempt to isolate New York and the virus. Then there is the matter of her and her young son's escape - just how was it possible to get out of a tunnel in Smith's lab after surviving an explosion, get off Manhattan despite the lack of bridges to the outside world and find a - rather smart - SUV with which to reach a colony of humans which has survived the virus and is re-establishing itself in Vermont? But what the hell. I've remarked elsewhere that there are two kinds of films: those which, for some reason, you like and which you will forgive many flaws, and those which, for some reason you take against and which you nitpick to death. Largely thanks to Will Smith and the rather splendid recreation of Manhattan as a wasteland, this film, for me, falls into the first category. You might feel that way as well.",6,0,0,25 April 2009
The Game," Something of a shaggy dog story but well worth the ride
","You've got something if you can slowly ratchet up the tension and keep us guessing until the last minute, but David Fincher's The Game is essentially a high-value shaggy dog story. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but in my book a film has slightly missed the point if you can't watch it again and again.Well, of course, you could watch The Game again and again, but once you know how it all ends, doing so becomes a little pointless. Then there's the danger that whereas the first time round we are sitting on the edges of our seats wondering where Michael Douglas's bad luck will take him next and, not least, what the hell is it all about, at second, third and maybe even fourth viewings - and knowing full well how it all plays out - the viewer will start picking holes here, there and everywhere. That would be unfair, of course, but that's exactly what we would do.But what the hell: you are either reading this wondering whether is worth your time taking a gander, in which case I say unequivocally 'go for it'. Or you have seen it, have your own view about how good a film it is and are wondering what others made of it. In that case, you probably agree with me that it's worth the ride, but starts to lose on points the more you reflect on it.I, too, have been looking at the opinions of others, and should warn the first-time viewer that although it is all hugely enjoyable and intriguing, it is, at the end of the day, just a piece of very well-made, thoroughly gripping hooey. Great filmmaking it ain't.",7,0,2,12 December 2014
Shrek the Third," Good romp for kids - but self-regarding cineastes avoid (as we avoid them)
","Those IMDb users who have criticised Shrek The Third rather miss the point. There are two films here: one for children and one - if you like - for everyone else. The one for children, like the first two Shrek films, is a delight. Lots of laughs, lots of fighting, a bit of this and a bit of that. It's just what children enjoy. And if 'grown-ups' (as they are quaintly described, the term, misleadingly, implying that they have reached a degree of maturity) can get into the spirit of it, they, too, will enjoy this thoroughly. If, on the other hand, you really do want to insist on stepping back and pointing out various failings in the film, there are some we can mention. The story is very, very flimsy. Who is this Artie or Arthur, who is, apparently, next in line to the throne? What relation is he to the dying king? And exactly why is he a 'loser' if only to supply the necessary plot device of coming good in the end and, deus ex machina, to save Shrek from, well, death? Making him a loser also allows the film to deliver the, by now, obligatory, sermon on how 'everyone can be a winner/everyone is important/everyone can be themselves etc. (and, unfortunately, ad nauseam). Apropos this kind of Dick and Dora sermonising, there was a neat line in The Incredibles when one little boy's mother says 'he is special' because 'everyone is special'. To which the lad replies with impeccable, though under the circumstances, graceless logic: 'If everyone is special, that means no one is.' Quite. It doesn't really pay to examine Hollywood's cod sermonising too closely. But back to Shrek The Third. A great deal is made of how the gals are just as good as the guys - this is, after all, a 21st century film and acknowledging a feminist cliché or two is equally as obligatory. So we see the sisters in action as the king's widow and Fiona's mother knocks down a granite prison wall with her forehead, while the rest of the sisters then go on to demonstrate some very nifty, not to say cool, action man - sorry, action woman - moves. Well, that's all well and good, but feminism was apparently forced to take a back seat when the king died and Shrek is declared his heir. Sorry, but isn't Fiona his daughter and shouldn't she, as his direct descendant, inherit his crown? And speaking of queens, why couldn't the king's widow take over after the king's death and rule until she died? It seems that Hollywood likes to promote feminism but not too much. It might rock the boat. Finally, perhaps I missed something, but why is Prince Charming a baddie? What turned him into a baddie? We don't seem to have been informed. It can't be because his stage performance was booed, can it? Surely not. That would simply be too facile. So why is he a baddie? Well there you have three quibbles, three quite substantial holes which rather dent this particular exercise in film-making. But ask your children: do they care? Do they heck, they just cheer on the good guys and hiss the baddies (who all, in another of those excessively mawkish Hollywood twists, come good in the end. All together now: Aaaahh.) So take heart: if your sensibility can accept these utterly gross transgressions in the laws of good film-making, and if, on the other hand, you really do enjoy stunning animation, some good jokes and of you can suspend your undoubted maturity for 90 minutes and simply want an enjoyable film, Shrek The Third will not disappoint.",6,0,1,24 August 2008
The Hurt Locker," Neither fish nor fowl, and that is the essence of a very real problem with this film
","I watch a film and then, for better or worse, look through several reviews here on IMDb. I like to think that none influences me. First, I look at the 'I hated it' category because, oddly, it gives you some perspective on the criteria of how a film is being judged. Then I look at the 'I loved it' category. This, too, is helpful, though not quite as one might initially imagine. Haters and lovers seem both to be at the extremes and, as a general rule, their views can be taken with a pinch of salt. Finally, I look at the most recent reviews, in the assumption that the dust has settled somewhat and that passions, either way, will have cooled. Usually that strategy is quite helpful in clarifying one's thoughts. But in the case of The Hurt Locker none of the reviews, or rather none I read, came anywhere close to touching upon my criticisms. And these are quite complex and touch upon the very essence of film-making (and, believe me, I really hope this doesn't sound pretentious). There are documentaries and then there are films, and once upon a time it was, usually, stylistically easy to distinguish the one from the other. Films, once, were stagy. Documentaries were, once, immediate. And the essence of both, both visually and aurally, was reflected in the style of film-making. But with technologically advance, in filming and sound recording, the obvious distinction between the two has become very blurred. Hand-held cameras and radio recording have allowed the film-maker making the 'commercial' film to produce what is essentially fiction and make it look pretty realistic. And that is the problem. And The Hurt Locker is a very good case in point. It has long been argued that 'dramatic fiction' can get pretty close to the truth. Well, I'm sure it can. But your average punter, sitting in the cinema or watching a DVD has no way of knowing what exactly is what. He is perfectly entitled to ask him or herself: just how truthful is what I am watching? And the pertinent point is that he or she has absolutely no way of knowing. Complete cobblers can look pretty realistic, and satirists have made good use of the fact. So in The Hurt Locker, what is what? Is this fiction? Is this 'dramatic fiction'? Is this more or less en par with documentary. I don't know. And neither do you. One criticism levelled at the film by several of the 'haters' underlines the dilemma: where (the haters ask) is the story? What's the plot? Ms Bigelow might well respond that she was more interested in portraying 'dramatic truth'. Fair enough. But how are we, the punter munching popcorn in the Mid-West or watching the film on a laptop, able to pass judgement? Are we judging another piece of entertainment? Are we just 'enjoying a film'? Are we, on the other hand, seeing what it was like to be an American or Brit soldier serving in Iraq after the war? We just don't know. But your average punter being your average punter, he or she (but given the subject matter far more likely he) will draw quite a few conclusions about 'the war in Iraq' which could well be true and, equally, could well be complete cobblers. The vital point is that we don't know and never will be in a position to know. And that is the problem Ms Bigelow faces. There are further, more profound, problems. The producers weren't, I should think, financing a truthful portrayal of the work the 'Allies' were doing in Iraq. They were, whatever Ms Bigelow managed to portray, financing what, at the end of the day, was intended to turn a buck or two, or three, or four. If, in the process, Ms Bigelow as managed to portray an honest and accurate account of the Western forces' work in Iraq, all well and good. So long as the dollars roll in. And if, on the other hand, she has, despite her work's documentary appearance, simply produced just another gung-ho war film, fair enough. So long as the dollars roll in. The point is that we, the viewer have no way of knowing. And it is that, the viewer's dilemma, which really does count. The Hurt Locker is immensely watchable. But that, at the end of the day, says pretty much nothing at all.",Null,1,3,7 September 2011
The Illusionist," Yet more undemanding, hammy hokum. But enjoy - why not?
","Read other IMDb member comments here and yet again they seem to go to extremes. The fact is that The Illusionist is not brilliant but not bad either. On the downside, it is all rather hammy, from the cod German accents to the impeccably clean Viennese streets which remain in a pristine condition despite the many horses travelling the city streets, from the convenient meetings to the several jarring modernisms (in the stuffy world of Austro-Hungarian royalty, the Duchess would never have been allowed to be alone with the Prince). And yet who cares? On the upside the Illusionist is an old piece of hokum which will entertain you for a while and is better than many other films. If I were picky, I would also remark that in The Illusionist is a far better and far more interesting film waiting to be made, but in the meantime all we have is this. You might probably catch it on TV one of these nights. Toss a coin - heads you watch, tails you don't. Oh, what the hell. As long as you don't expect art or some such high-falutin tosh, you'll be reasonably entertained. And Ed Norton is always worth the price of admission, even in such middle-brow hokum as this. Oddly the film seems to have been summed up in the rather ludicrous disguise the illusionist adopts right at the end of the film when he catches his train. And why does he tip off the police inspector as to what he has done if not only to give the film it's final twist. Oh well, who cares. I don't.",5,0,1,8 November 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," A pointless and repulsive waste of time
","Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesn't quite work that way. You're only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. That's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). On every level  except the technical  this film stinks. Avoid.",1,69,124,4 June 2007
The Dark Knight," Distinctly average and surprisingly rather dull
","It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.",5,44,98,24 April 2009
The Graduate," Rather darker than the comedy/drama/romance billed here - but very much worth the ride
","I was remarking to someone just last night that I'd watched Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider only twice and that I saw a completely different film on both occasions. The first time I saw in the Sixties before that decade revealed itself as silly and nasty, it was a fable of 'them' against 'us' and how an older generation would hold out against a younger, more open, more optimistic, more adventurous younger generation.The second time, at least 30 years on, what struck me was how prescient Dennis Hopper had been about just how superficial and vacuous the so-called 'hippy generation' was for all it's idealism and bravura. In where in that first viewing Peter Fonda was the main character and seemed to be calling the shots, The second time around the main character was definitely they less obviously Dennis Hopper's cynical co-rider.I mention Easy Rider in a review of Mike Nicholls's The Graduate because much the same occurred: I first saw it when it came out and like everyone else thought it a smart, fresh, witty and often very funny take on young love and how young, sincere live will out whatever. Tonight I saw a very different, in some ways far darker film, one about obsession and loneliness, how the cruel innocence of youth can cut to the quick the soul of someone who has lived a little and learned a little more.I decided to watch the film again after hearing a radio play on the film's genesis, how producer Lawrence Turman persuaded Nicholls, a respected Broadway director who until then had never made a film, that the novel The Graduate by Charles Webb would make an excellent film. It didn't seem so to anyone else Turman and Nicholls tried to get interested. And even when respected Hollywood heavyweight Joe Levine added his support and the project slowly took off, there were objections to Nicholls's casting decision, particularly having Dustin Hoffman cast as what until then was accepted to be a blonde WASP Benjamin Braddock. But Nicholls held out, having a particular take on the character as being an outsider, just as he, basically a German Jewish immigrant, and Turman, another Jew, were outsiders in Hollywood.So watch it I did and, as I say, a far darker film revealed itself, one which was not about innocent young love but obsession and loneliness. Take Ben Braddock's behaviour: one can accept his gaucheness in view of his seduction by Mrs Robinson and even his tactlessness to the older woman once the affair is underway can be excused, as indeed Mrs Robinson, a woman of the world, does excuse it. But his subsequent pursuit of Elaine, a girl he barely knows, which could all to easily be mistaken for stalking, is decidedly unhealthy. This is not 'true love' needing to find its way as we once thought, it is the obsession of a young man who knows little about the world, isn't particularly aware and quite probably suffers from a bad case of extreme solipsism.The film's very final shot is telling: once he has grabbed his prize and he and Elaine have escaped the church wedding and are sitting on the bus off to start life together, it seems to dawn on both very quickly - and apparently from the looks on their faces to concern them - that all they were really interested in was striking a blow against their elders. And that once that had been done - well, what next? They both seem not to have a clue. They do not come across as two young people who have found a soulmate, rather as two young people suddenly overwhelmed by the course of events.Then there is Mrs Robinson herself, a middle-aged woman (sexily portrayed by Anne Bancroft) caught in a loveless marriage who merely wants to protect her daughter, possibly the one thing she can still cherish in an otherwise empty life, from making the same mistake as herself - her marriage and thus her wealthy but hollow existence was founded on a quick f*ck in the back of her student boyfriend's Ford. Once pregnant she had to give up the art course she obviously enjoyed and it will seem little wonder that she eventually turned to the bottle.Ben Braddock, of course, the solipsistic young graduate she begins an affair with his wholly oblivious to life outside his own being and doesn't even begin to suspect that his middle- aged lover might be very unhappy and that her pursuit of him has less to do with sex and more to do with a far more personal need.My take on how much darker the film is than at first we thought, might make it sound rather heavy going, but actually the film is nothing of the kind and to many will seem to be the romantic comedy it was first billed to be. Nicholls has such a light touch and worked with such a witty script that what I seem to discern is merely what might - or might not - be discovered in its depths. Yet I don't think I am being fanciful. Mrs Robinson, possibly a figure of fun to some, is undoubtedly a very unhappy woman, and I for one am uncomfortable with laughing at someone else's unhappiness.Nicholls theatre background is evident from the film's staging, but is none the worse for that. The film does little but mover from scene to scene, but is saved from any static staginess by some very imaginative camera angles and shots and Nicholls proved himself to have an interesting cinematic eye. If you are young and have never before seen The Graduate, I urge you to see it. If you have seen it before and are considering doing so again after many years, do so: it is a great film which well stands the test of time.",8,7,7,30 April 2015
Taken," Unpretentious, fast-moving, utterly preposterous enjoyable schlock
","Taken proves one thing beyond doubt: that even the cheapest schlock can sparkle in the right hands. Sparkles about the word, too, because there is less to Taken than a Bonfire Night sparkler. Fizz, fizz, fizz, then that's it. Taken is nonsense, but directed and acted at such a frenetic pace that you really don't have much time to reflect on anything except to wonder what might be coming next. The plot - I use the word loosely - stinks. Dad out to rescue his daughter. But as Dad happens to be a former CIA operative with an impressive array of technical and martial arts skills, the film gets a certain dimension. Liam Neeson is Dad, and does the action hero spiel rather well. Being rather the craggy sort lends him a credibility which is utterly spurious but which last as long as the film. And that is all that's needed. This is an action movie and nothing else. And it does not pretend to be anything else. It could have been atrociously bad, but it's not. It's very well-made, so the gaping plot holes - an example: an American (tho' Neeson is Irish, but let's let that pass) pretends he is a corrupt French cop and when he confronts a gang of ruthless Albanian thugs, they all speak English - don't rankle in the slightest. Lots of car chases, lots of gun-play, lots of fighting, lots of cleverness with all kinds of gadgets - what else good a boy want. Well, quite a bit more, actually, but Taken isn't that kind of film. It is what it is and basta cosi, so it deserves and extra mark for honesty. Don't look to closely, just enjoy the chase.",6,0,0,8 January 2010
Avatar," Visually stunning sentimental drivel
","It has to be said that if you've seen Dances With Wolves or any of the other pseudo-humanistic, post-hippy films in which man learns better ways via the good offices of 'natives' far more in tune with nature and that his way of life isn't everything, the story in Avatar is not going to surprise you. Best stick to the visuals, which are stunning. James Cameron might be all clichéd thumbs when it comes to telling a human story, but with his creation of the planet Pandora, he has come up with an imaginative alternative to Mother Earth. But is that enough to sustain the movie? No, not really. The plot is very straightforward – man needs to get his greedy mitts on a mineral (called, believe it or not 'unobtainium' – is that some kind of in-joke?) which exists on the planet Pandora, but that planet's indigenous people, a blue-skinned race who are 'in tune with nature' are naturally not too chuffed about the rape of their planet. Throw in a couple of extremely bad guys – the military man and the corporate man who will stop at nothing, not even genocide, to get the stuff they need - and the film is set up for a pretty conventional trajectory. Then there's a paraplegic marine who starts out as being more aligned to the bad guys, but is finally won over to the right path by the love of a good woman, and so the cast of two-dimensional characters is almost complete. Almost, because there is also the anthropologist who wants to find out more about the blue-skinned 'natives'. Much of the film is taken up with the marine/native hybrid undergoing rites of passage and it is more or less a sentimental smooze fest, great if that's your bag, not so great if, like me, it makes you all a bit queasy. Naturally, this being the kind of 'nature knows best and we had better listen to her voice' tract, there is wall-to-wall music which is equally as sentimental. So, to coin a phrase, there's rather less to Avatar than meets the eye. Granted the stunning recreation of an alternative planet – stunning even if like me you watch the DVD on a laptop and don't get to enjoy the full 3D experience – goes a long way to making Avatar something of a standout production, but even that can only take you so far. So far, so Hollywood. So far, a great one for Saturday night with a bag full of popcorn and lots of super-stunning visuals. But, given the obvious allusions made by Cameron and his producers, allusions to the Vietnam War, the cultures of the African people, the Native American tribes who also attempted to resist the encroachment of 19th-century 'sky people' – land rather than unobtainium was their prize - and given the allusions to the 'war on terror', I feel I might be allowed to take my cue and add a few, rather more pointed, comments. The real story of the Native American fightback ended in outright tragedy for them all. Several millions were killed, all of them were displaced and dispossessed, and for many the result of white man's greed is misery, alcoholisms and perpetual unemployment. Cameron's Avatar has the obligatory feelgood happy ending, but the conclusion of the Native Americans' fightback was anything but a happy ending. And before anyone thinks this review has developed into some kind of anti-U.S. rant, let me add that the French, Brits, Dutch, Germans, Spanish, Portuguese adventurers who scoured the world and destroyed peoples in their insatiable search for minerals and wealth were equally as nasty. And to add insult to injury they all insisted, po-faced, that they were trying to bring 'civilisation' to 'savages'. In the light of that do Cameron and his producers really think that a multi-billion piece of what is at the end of the day 24-carat sentimental feelgood drivel can make up for what was done to those several million Native Americans and other indigenous people? I rather think not. But back to the film: as standard Hollywood stuff, Avatar has what it takes, and will do just fine if that's what you like. Best not to take it in the lightest bit seriously, however.",4,3,7,6 January 2011
Super 8," Great film for kids but sadly pulls its punches a little too much for older folk
","For most of the way through Super 8 kept reminding myself to advise my 12-year-old son to watch it. Adults, too, will like it up to a point, and that point comes when the film's resolution is no resolution at all. When my children were younger, and sometimes still today, we watch Doctor Who together and the notably thing was that all-too-often I would get hopelessly lost and confused. Why? Because I was watching it through and adult's eyes. My two youngsters had no such problem. 'How come he was able simply to get up and walk out,' I would ask. 'Because,' they would reply, with all the scorn a child reserves for a dimwit adult, 'he used his sonic screwdriver!' This is that kind of film. Great story, but when it comes to getting an explanation for what turns out to be a truly fantastical tale, we are left begging. Super 8 involves a group of five young lads of about that age and a slightly older girl who are making a film on a super 8 camera, and its portrayal of those six is honest and truthful. While out filming, they witness a truly horrific train crash, and one of them realises that it was no accident. Cue heavy-handed air force serviceman, led by a particularly nasty type, to descend on the crash. They realise that someone has witnessed the crash and also start hunting whoever it was. Meanwhile, all kinds of weird goings on afflict the town nearby - all the dogs run off, the metal parts of everything goes missing, the electricity supply is continually disrupted, people are attacked by a 'thing' and finally the nasty air force men create a brushfire which threatens the town as a pretext for clearing the town in their hunt for the thing. So far, so good and so engrossing. But when it comes to these plot strands being resolved, I'm afraid writer/director/producer J J Abrams imagination seems to desert him. Worse, he pulls his punches badly: where we are led to believe that the 'thing' attacks people in order to kill them, they are, in fact, simply held captive in his lair (eventually to be rescued unharmed naturally - this is, after all, a certificate 13 film). But crucially no explanation is given whatsoever why the 'thing' should even bother to kidnap people as they neither threaten it and are of no use to it, either. Sadly, the attacks and the kidnaps are just a plot device. Oh, well. That's why this film - well-made, well-directed and well-acted by everyone, especially the youngsters - is more suited to uninquiring young minds who will not in the at all be disturbed by glaring holes in the plot. Given that the Steven Spielberg co-produces, the production values are high. I was especially gratified that the youngsters were not the nauseating cutey-sweet or all-knowing and cynical quasi-adults Hollywood likes to present us with, but ordinary straight-down-the-line 12 and 14-year-olds. That was one of the film's strengths. But all means go and take your youngsters to see a half-decent film, but for yourself be prepared for a little disappointment.",Null,0,1,21 September 2011
The Last Samurai," Dancing With Wolves with sushi - same kind of sentimental guff
","Where would Hollywood be without its all-pervading soundtrack? Often, I think, nowhere. It's no secret that the soundtrack is an important element in any film, but when you get a wall-to-wall sentimental swish of sound such as in The Last Samurai, you know the film isn't half as good as its cracked up to be. This is very much Dancing With Wolves with sushi - the noble reactionary Japanese as symbolised by all that noble samurai history and it noble traditions pitted against the venal modernisers who will stop at nothing to drag their country into the modern age and get their filthy hands on all the gold and goodies the modern age will bring them. The Last Samurai is, sadly, despite some well filmed battle films and some great scenery - even the pouring rain is picturesque, don't you know - pretty much standard fair (and it doesn't surprise me that the saintly Roger Ebert gives it four out of five - he made too many elemental errors in too many reviews for me to be able to take him fully seriously any longer). The story is loosely based on a real-life character, a Frenchman called Jules Brunet, who sided with the shogun in a civil war in the late 1860s. This Cruise vehicle inexplicably postpones everything for ten years and in many other ways simplifies the truth. Nothing wrong with filching and then bastardising history as a basis for your film, story, musical or poem - even Shakespeare did it - and I'm sure it can be well done. But when it comes with that mushy wall-to-wall soundtrack and faux profound lines about 'destiny' you know this is art as popcorn entertainment rather than anything more serious. As usual, the IMDb fraternity and, no doubt, it sorority either loved it - awesome and 'so deep' - or hated it. I did neither. The Last Samurai is a competent actioner with Tom Cruise and an absolutely gorgeous woman as the 'love interest', the widow of the samurai warrior he killed. Our Tom starts off living in her house on her brother's orders - her brother is the top dog - and initially threatens to kill herself if he doesn't leave (she thinks he stinks like a pig). But eventually she softens and falls in love with the reformed drunkard and, were this to take place in America, would undoubtedly have 'fixed him a steak' and shown her all her high school pictures. As it is, she insists he wears her dead husband's samurai armour for the final showdown battle with the venal, nasty, two-faced modernisers. Look, The Last Samurai is a great film for a night in with two bottles of Shiraz and loads of nibbles. It's pretty, has Tom Cruise - part of the prettiness - and that wall-to-wall soundtrack I keep banging on about whose sole purpose is to to keep you happy and informed as to what you should be feeling. It might well be your bag. By the way, I really, really doubt Japanses cities had telephone poles and lines littering their streets as this film would have you believe. So ignore them and get on with the soundtrack. Oh, and by the way: in an odd sort of way the casting of Scotsman Billy Connolly as an Irishman sums up that The Last Samurai doesn't quite add up. Connolly's oirish accent keeps slipping into his native Glaswegian within just a few seconds of him opening his mouth. So why couldn't the producers have simply made Connolly's character a Scotsman? Problem solved (well, except for that bloody soundtrack).",6,0,0,20 March 2011
From Hell," Entertaining enough...
","The 'Jack the Ripper' murders endure for no other reason than that the man himself was never identified. There have been equally as brutal murders the world over, but these are different because not having anyone to finger, we can finger anyone. And that is exactly what writers, playwrights and movie-makers have done ever since. Actually, 'Jack the Ripper' was as much an invention of the then nascent tabloid Press as anything else. The name is supposedly derived from a letter the murderer is said to have sent to the Press, but the received wisdom is that it was, in fact, dreamed up by some sub-editor with one eye on a good headline to a cracking story. (One of the first and most useful pieces of advice I and more or less every young reporter is given when starting out on our careers of discovering and unearthing the truth wherever it might lurk is: 'Don't let a couple of facts stand in the way of a good story.' I am pleased to report that I haven't, ever.) There is even very credible doubt that there even was a Jack the Ripper. Around the time his alleged victims were butchered, another six or seven other working girls in the neighbourhood were also murdered. The Ripper murders were attributed to the one killer merely because of the particularly gruesome manner five of the victims were mutilated and disembowelled. So these deaths have always been a fertile ground for artists of most kind (and one artist, the celebrated Walter Sickert, has also been named as the 'definitive Jack the Ripper). Here 'the Hughes Brothers' of whom I had never heard until tonight — are they, too, perhaps the invention of some overwrought sub-editor's imagination? — rework the story and interweave the gruesome end of the five prostitutes with a conspiracy which, as we subs are apt to proclaim in our sub-heads, 'goes right to the very top'. As stories and conspiracies go, it isn't half bad. Unfortunately, a previous Ripper film got in there first more than 20 years earlier, but From Hell is none the worse for that. The cast plays it rather well, especially Johnny Depp, whose lower-class London accent has been criticised by some, but it didn't offend me, and if that is the worst criticism that could be aimed at From Hell, the fabled 'Hughes Brothers' have little to worry about. Depp, as usual (well, in these viewers eyes, at least) again seems to ham it up, but very subtly, that is, not so you'd notice. In fact, the man can play this kind of part with his eyes closed, and I, for one, would like to see him in a far more challenging role where real acting is demanded rather than simply not forgetting his lines and not bumping into the furniture. I like to think we wouldn't be disappointed. I wasn't particularly convinced by Heather Graham who must be one of the cleanest whores working the streets in Whitechapel. Apart from these two Yanks, each more or less successfully adopting English accents — which rather begs the question: why cast Yanks? — the rest of the cast are all old familiar faces, lead from the front by the ever dependable Ian Holm and Ian Richardson, who can also both turn in the required performance with their eyes shut and still be home in good time for supper. Prague doubled up as East London, and a rather clean and sanitised East London it was, too. But I mustn't grumble: From Hell provides an entertaining two hours of rather good hokum, doesn't descend to the rather cheap depths of a slasher movie and will get you and your friends discussing the identity of the Ripper and the conspiracy behind it for, oh, at least six minutes before you find something better to do. Oh, and the usual caveat: elsewhere in these member's reviews you will find the standard hyperbole of From Hell being the best film ever made ever. Why do they bother?",6,1,2,8 May 2009
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A subtle and honest account the Irish Republic's genesis.
","When it was released, The Hand That Shakes The Barley garnered all-to-predictable condemnation from several right-of-centre commentators. They concentrated on the film's portrayal of the notorious Black and Tan mercenaries as ruthless, sadistic and murderous - well - mercenaries, decried Loach's film as a treacherous attack on Britain, his mother country, and generally wrote the film off as worthless leftist propaganda. Well, whether wilfully or not, they miss the point entirely.Loach has produced a far more subtle film, and it is a film which demands a more considered response. It doesn't help that Loach has a reputation as an uncompromising left filmmaker, and many feel that rules him out from the start. But given Loach's politics, The Wind does not take easy shots. The ruthlessness of the Black and Tan is a matter of record, as is England's shameful history of brutal repression in Ireland from the days of Elizabeth I on. And anyone who feels such points, whenever they are made, are merely pro-Irish, anti-English propaganda should be asked to explain English brutality in the Highland Clearances. Why, not an Irishman in sight.As for The Wind That Shakes The Barley, Loach's approach is never as broad-brush as his critics claim. For example, the Black and Tans are ruthless, and shown to be brutal, but Loach has one character, an English officer, indicate obliquely just why: after spending four years fighting in the Great War trenches and seeing comrades slaughtered, it is not surprising that they should have become brutalised. This does not justify their behaviour, but does to some extent offer an explanation.Loach also has one Black and Tan trooper, revolted by what he is part off, help Irish republican soldiers escape and then join them.More tellingly, the film's earlier scenes of Black and Tan behaviour is juxtaposed with equally nasty behaviour by Free State troops against their own when, after the Treaty is signed. the tragic civil war pitched brother against brother.Loach is also admirably more even-handed than his critics would allow in his exposition of the dilemma faced by Ireland: should they settle for what is on offer, a Free State and pledging allegiance to the English Crown now and pursue a longer-term strategy for gaining complete independence? Or should the reject this pragmatic compromise and carry on the fight until they have achieved complete independence? This is the dilemma which split the country in two and which saw the murder of Michael Collins as a man regarded by the more purist republicans as a patsy who, seduced by the good living in his Knightsbridge, London, headquarters, had sold out to the English.Loach's even-handed approach has him (and his excellent scriptwriter Paul Laverty) have a character, the one brother, spell out Britain's own dilemma: if they allow full independence to Ireland (and even the more limited concessions Lloyd George and Winston Churchill made to Collins took the Irish by surprise), they would be inviting trouble form their other dominions - Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India - which legitimately ask 'if the Irish, then why not us, too?' (One might or might not like what the British Empire was and represented, but any honest man is bound to concede that that was a hell of a political dilemma. From the English point of view, the substance of the Treaty was the wisest course of action.) As for the film itself, Loach, who apparently always works on a shoestring, does well. The cinematography is up to the standard of some of the best high budget Hollywood and Bollywood films, and the acting is without exception top-notch. My guess is that the actors were also, to some, extent spurred on to give such moving performances by the tragic subject matter of the script.One, very silly reviewer (in Britain's Daily Telegraph) described this as more or less a soap opera which gave a mawkish portrayal of rural Irish life. Don't believe a word of it. There is nothing sentimental or mawkish here. Instead, there are several quite outstanding and powerful scenes: when an English landlord is executed and then his stable-hand, a youth the IRA have known all their lives, is also shot; when the pragmatic IRA commander sets free a greedy businessman, who is bilking a pensioner and has been temporarily jailed by a Republican state court, because the IRA needs his money to buy weapons; the debate between the two factions which follows that scene; the sermon by the parish priest who despairs as to what is going on in his country, only to see the more hard-line, purist republicans walk out of church; the scene where the one brother pleads with his harder line brother to co-operate and save himself from the firing squad.Finally, what is telling is that Loach does not come down on the side of either brother. From the point of view of the Irish, both courses of action - take what's on offer or fight on for more - were legitimate.The tragedy was that the Irish nation tore itself apart over which course of action to take. Wisely and honestly, Loach concedes that neither faction had right on its side and to have pretended otherwise would have diminished this film gravely. For the record and in view of what other reviewers claim, I don't feel Loach sided with anyone.I often make the point that there are films which win us over and whose flaws and slight faults we are thus inclined to overlook. Then there are films which, for whatever reason, fail to win us over and whose flaws and slight faults count all the more against them. The Wind That Shakes The Barley won me - and Englishman and by no means 'of the left' - over entirely. It is more subtle than similar work and an intelligent and moving account of the tragic early years of the Irish Republic.",8,2,5,20 November 2008
The Untouchables," Very good actioner, but - well - one or two quibbles 20 years on
","Brian DePalma's The Untouchables, made in 1987, demonstrates in what subtle ways film-making has changed in these past 20 years. The Untouchables is an admirable actioner in which, as of course, it should, good beats bad and we can all sleep soundly in bed at night knowing that guys such as Eliot Ness are out there fighting the good fight. It would be tactless to point out here that back in the real world, at the time Ness was operating, the cops were more intent on brutal strike-breaking and beating up the unemployed than nailing gangsters such as Al Capone, but then this is real life as seen through the Tinseltown lens, not real life as experienced by many on the dole queues. Anyway, this is Hollywood, and DePalma does point out that he has created a fiction based on fact and is not trying to show what really happened. And what he has created is a decent film, loads of action and great moments of suspense. I first saw The Untouchables when it was released and liked it. Twenty years on, it doesn't satisfy quite as much. In retrospect, and compared with similar work being produced these days, it is remarkably one-dimensional. There is precious little characterisation, precious little motivation and the ease with with Ness and just three sidekicks manages to nail Capone is all rather too glib. Capone, the unofficial mayor of Chicago, had, after all, the chief of police in his pocket, the city council, much of the judiciary and Lord know who else. But in the DePalma's version of events, Ness does it and does it seemingly with ease. A more satisfying film and the film a more modern director might have attempted would surely have shown a little more of the moral ambiguity which made it all possible, the process by which Capone held such supreme control. And I doubt it would have gone for what can only be described as the cartoon option of giving Ness three partners straight from central casting: the gruff, tough and straight Irish cop, who isn't above taking a dram himself despite buying alcohol being illegal; the kooky egghead accountant who discovers the joy of firing a shotgun and is also not above enjoying an illegal snifter; and the 'ethnic' from the wrong side of the tracks. Historically, Ness had a far larger squad of 'untouchables' and, ironically, wasn't actually responsible for putting Capone behind bars: the accountants did do that, finally nailing the seemingly invincible Capone because he hadn't paid any income tax, and the Volstead Act banning alcohol was eventually repealed. But what the hell, this is avowedly fiction and fiction is what we get. Subsidiary quibbles might be that however great an actor Robert De Niro is, on screen he is not Al Capone but invariably De Niro acting well. Ditto Sean Connery (who must be the first Irishman with a pronounced Scottish brogue). They suffer from the unfortunate fact that it is so difficult to suspend disbelief when they are on screen. Kevin Costner was a relative unknown when he starred in this film and Charles Martin Smith as the kooky accountant is one of those actors who face seems familiar but you can't quite place him. It seems unreasonable to quibble, but just how moral was the untouchable Eliot Ness when, as he does here, he takes justice into his own hands and hurls from a great height the, admittedly very nasty, Capone henchman who had brutally gunned down Sean Connery. This is morality American style. But what the hell, this film was made 20 years ago and cannot really be condemned for not pressing all the modern buttons as well as one might have liked. By all means worth a visit.",7,0,2,30 September 2009
Mystic River," A potentially great film spoiled by a very odd ending.
","There's the well-known gibe about an incompetent general 'snatching defeat from the jaws of victory', and although director Clint Eastwood has not exactly served up a turkey, the final ten minutes of Mystic River to force one to ask: what on earth was he thinking? The film could, if you allow the conceit, be seen to follow the 'arc' of tragedy, with everything coming to a head in the fourth act, and the final fifth act settling things, acting as a kind of resolution. In that case, Eastwood's – or was he perhaps following studio orders? I very much doubt it but it would be only fair to ask – produces a spectacularly inappropriate final act, which doesn't exactly ruin the film, but does make it rather less than it might have been which is very, very good indeed. I'm not one for recapping 'what happened', but briefly the abduction by two paedophiles of one of three young lads playing in the street is, in many ways central to the story (from the novel by Denis Lehane who also wrote the novel on which Shutter Island was based). The abducted lad (Tim Robbins) never really recovers from his ordeal, and although that is not the central theme of the film, it is a crucial plot point. Meeting the three lads and witnessing the abduction works as a prologue, and we are reintroduced to them later in life. The abducted lad has become a handyman who has never worked the evil he was subjected to out of his system and in a curious plot twist this leads to his death. The second of the lads (Kevin Bacon) ends up as a homicide detective whose pregnant wife has left him, and the third (Sean Penn) has become a corner shop owner after a shaky start in life in which he served two years in jail. It would be futile to try to outline the plot further, as it is so intricately and cleverly. But I should add that the daughter of the corner shop owner is found beaten to death and the lad who became a homicide detective is assigned to the case alongside his sergeant. The handyman is briefly suspected of the murder after his alibi on the night comes into question, and his troubled behaviour leads to his death. Although Mystic River (and I have yet to understand the significance of that title) is partly a straightforward and very good mystery thriller as Bacon and his partner (Laurence Fishbourne) set about solving the murder, coming across wholly unexpected evidence. Meanwhile, Penn, the murdered girl's father vows to find the killer himself (with the help of two criminal associates), and Robbins, who comes into the frame after having briefly been in the same bar as the murdered girl and later arriving home covered in blood with a shaky story about having been mugged slowly goes to pieces. But that's all I shall tell you and, really, as far as this review is concerned, that's all you need to know. So far so good, and Mystic River, which unsurprisingly is well acted, well plotted, well directed and well filmed seems well on its way to becoming something of a classic. But oddly it all goes very. Very wrong in two scenes which make very little sense at all. In the first, Penn's wife (Laura Linney.), who knows what her husband has done – he has killed someone – persuades him that it is all for the good and that it will make him a stronger, better man. The scene would, perhaps, had made more sense – though not a great deal more – had Eastwood somehow acquainted us more with Linney's character, but we doesn't. In this odd scene, she is portrayed as some kind of gangster's moll who feels she has to stand by her man and provide a little backbone. But apart from that scene being out of kilter with the rest of the film, it incomprehensibly tries to show Penn's character as some kind of heroic figure, when he is, in fact, nothing of the kind. By the end of the film we realise that he is nothing better than a small-time thug, so why Eastwood tacked on – and tacking on is what he seems to have done – the scene between Penn and Linney is bizarre. The second oddity is that Bacon's detective knows full well what has happened – that Penn has murdered the handyman – yet apparently is happy to let it slide. Or if not happy to let it slide, at least, somehow 'understands'. There is a suggestion that he intends coming after Penn at some future date, but the tone of the film doesn't suggest much urgency. Penn, the grieving, vengeful father of the murdered girl, it seems, is supposed to be rather heroic. Well, forgive me for disagreeing. It's always possible, that I have missed something, have misunderstood something, and that Mystic River, as conceived by Eastwood, makes good sense. But it's also possible that Eastwood has simply misjudged his project and tacked on an ending which might satisfy those who like a sentimental conclusion but which otherwise rather ruins what could have been very, very good. Finally, what was the significance of Bacon being reunited with his wife? Marriage and the relationship all three lads have, when grown up, with their wives, seems to be a theme, but I, for one, could not make head or tail of what it is supposed to signify. I would be obliged to give Mystic River 7/10 – it is exceptionally well-made and well acted – but I do feel the very odd ending spoils it all rather too much. Hence my rating. The average rating of 8/10 is fair enough if you want a rattling thriller, but rather OTT if you're a little more discerning. The odd ending does spoil it all rather too much.",6,0,1,2 April 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Die Hard with a feisty CIA heroine - don't forget the popcorn and Coke
","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty is very much like the food we see in ads, it looks the part, but that's about as close as it we comes to being food. In advertising food photography, white paint doubles up as double cream and dishes are lavished with dry ice to appear steamingly hot for the brief tenths of a second when the photo is taken. This film looks the part, but otherwise . . .Some might think that 9/11 and the hunt for the baddie who was ultimately responsible is - I've heard it said - the most important event of the 21st century. Well, quite apart from the fact that the century still has another 76 years to go, chalk that up to US hooey. And, from where I stand, also chalk up to US hooey that they are 'the good guys' and that anyone who is not on their side and whistles the same patriotic tunes, is thus agin them and by definition 'a bad guy'.To be fair in a nation of close on 300 million there are plenty of dissenting voices appalled and embarrassed by some of their administration's practices - and it doesn't matter whether that administration is Democrat or Republican. (I personally find it extremely hard to stomach the official Yankee line that the United States of America is the centre of the universe. As it happens the Romans, the Byzantines, the Ottomans and we British also once thought that, and look what happened to all their respective glory.) Bigelow seems - and I must stress seems, because there is so little real thought in her film that maybe she didn't even consider it - that as the US is 'the good guy', it ain't bad when it uses torture. In fact, given the US's self-defined role of saving the world from assorted 'bad guys', torture can, in fact, be a good thing. Again to be fair, when the film came out, the CIA were horrified and insisted it had never used torture and we must take it by its word.That denial wouldn't, however, explain Abu Ghraib, waterboarding and the many admitted incidents of 'extraordinary rendition'. And isn't it odd, by the way, that when something unacceptable is done, there's a feeling that if we call it something else and use a euphemism, that something becomes half as bad. Then there's the central fact of this film which I shall call the murder of Osama Bin Laden, but which others claim can't be 'murder' because he was 'a bad guy'. But that's enough liberal ranting.As for the film, well despite the subject matter, it is really nothing more than Die Hard Part 17, with artsy hand-held camera work. According to Bigelow (who prefaces her film with that weaselly giveaway that Zero Dark Thirty is based on 'first hand accounts of actual events' which actually means nothing whatsoever but gives the film a spurious sheen of 'truth') the capture of Bin Laden was all down to the sterling, tenacious work of one dedicated woman, a woman, furthermore, who was feisty enough to best the men who stood in her way and wouldn't take no for an answer. So far, so nauseatingly Hollywood.As for characterisation, well there is none. which is a bit of a bummer for a film which comes in at over two and a half hours. In fact, there's really nothing much else except several hours of our feisty heroine being feisty (but human enough to shed a tear at the end of it all - aaahhh.) My advice: if you like Die Hard style films, stick to Die Hard because at least you're not expected to take it seriously.",3,0,4,23 March 2014
Steve Jobs," This is no biopic, but something far better
","In some ways Steve Jobs (written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle) is an odd film. There's nothing at all wrong with it at all, and a great deal that is right. But Apple fanboys and Mac nerds drooling for a big fat biopic will be very disappointed.Yes, you get a few biographical details, although very little that wasn't known, but this is a different animal entirely and most certainly not the kind of 'wasn't he just a fabulous genius' hagiography so many will have hoped for. (On that score, in fact, I'm puzzled that there have so far been so few calls from the 'Mac community' to have Jobs sanctified: in many eyes he already is St Steve, and all the Vatican would be doing would simply be to confirm the fact.)On the other hand the film produced by Sorkin and Boyle is odd in that it need not have been about Jobs at all: in essence their film is a study of a single-minded obsessive, his need for control and his relationship with his illegitimate daughter, and that obsessive could pretty much have been anyone, not least an utterly fictional character. From what we think we know about Jobs, he would seem to fit the bill, but he wasn't at all a necessary part of the film.Even to call it a film is debatable: essentially Sorkin and Boyle's Steve Jobs is a three-act play and would work well on stage in the hands of a talented theatre director (and quite possibly will at some point). It is also something of an ensemble piece, the ensemble being the very excellent Michael Fassbinder and the equally excellent Kate Winslet (ironically both British), with great support from Seth Rogen (in a serious role, unusually for him, but one he carries off well), Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg and Katherine Waterson as the needy, resentful discarded girlfriend.As I say, it would work equally well on stage, especially as the film is dialogue driven. What is particularly impressive is that the themes of Jobs difficulties coming to terms with his adoption as a baby and consequent need for total control, his fractured relationship with his daughter, his complicated relationship with the man who became the CEO of Apple and something of a father figure and the quirk that a man at times unbearably unpleasant inspired something close to love in so many who worked with him are treated with a delicacy sadly rare in a Hollywood film.My one complaint on that score is the schmaltzy scene right at the end of the film, though I understand that an element of pure schmaltz is pretty much de rigeur in all American-made films. It's what the public craves. Well, this viewer doesn't and could have done without it. But I'm glad to say coming at the end of the film and lasting but a few seconds it did nothing to spoil a very good film indeed. See it if you have the chance, but bear in mind my warning that it might be the very opposite of what you expect.",8,0,0,22 November 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Pretty much a very ordinary waste of my time and that of all others involved
","What do you do when you want to have a hoot, to have a little downtime? Well, you and I might ring a few friends, get a few cans of lager, find a guitar and throw an impromptu party. And what to the Coen brothers do (that's Joel and Ethan to you and I) when they just want to do nothing but let their hair down? Why, they make a film, that's what. That's what being worth several million and having a Tinseltown backstory of commercial success allows you to do. And Hail Caesar is that film. Is it any good? Well, not really, no. In fact, not at all.Granted - given that Tinseltown backstory and the investors rubbing their hands in anticipation - no expense is spared, and the Coen's latest has high production values, a full stable of stars - Clooney, Swinton, Brolin, Johansson, Fiennes and Tatum pop up (George, Tilda, Josh, Scarlett, 'Rafe and Channing to the Coens, no doubt) - one or two good lines and oodles of great camera shots, but dear hearts it is all for naught: Hail Caesar is just not very good. And it might well have been panned had any others but the saintly Coens been at the helm.I read just the other day that Hail Caesar was made after the brothers had completed scripts for several blockbusters, you know, the kind of films deemed to be 'possible Oscar winners' - Bridge Of Spies and Unbroken were just two - and the suggestion was that they wanted just to take it a little easy for a change.Well, Hail Caesar was the result. Bitty, potentially interesting but in practice rather dull, and - am I really going to say this? Yes, I am - pretty incoherent. The budget was an estimated $22 million and the take so far has been almost ten times that, so the backstory gets another chapter and the investors will indulge the brothers further. But for what? There's half a story, and several other quarter stories, none thought out but apparently merely sketched on the back of a Malibu restaurant menu, and then away it was. George, Tilda, Josh, Scarlett, 'Rafe and Channing, most hardly seen except for a few scenes and except for Brolin who plays what I suppose must be described as 'the central character', pretty much phone in their performances before taking off to weightier projects.The exception, perhaps, was young Alden Ehrenreich, who was able to flesh out rather nicely a part as small as all the others, but whose name I shall keep a look out for (he's still quite young), but even his performance goes no way to redeeming what to be frank is so sketchy it couldn't even be called a vanity project.Some themes are touched upon much as you and I - who, of course, are just ordinary schmucks - might pick consider picking up a bargain in the supermarket, then replacing it after losing interest within seconds and moving on. This takes place in the early Fifties and there's some slender sub-plot about a gang of Communist lefty writers kidnapping and holding to ransom a big star, Clooney. There's another sub-plot of a young starlet having to be married off somehow given that she will be dropping a kid in a few months, but that also remains resolutely and remorselessly undeveloped.There's a further, quite baffling, sub-plot about Brolin's Tinseltown fixer Eddie Mannix (the real one was apparently a nasty piece of work, but that's just by the by) being wooed to jack it all in and take over leading Lockheed, the plane makers. Why we aren't told and that, too, is left so sketchy as to be pretty much irrelevant.So there you have it: the Coens have fun and let their hair down and have a good time. Trouble is, I didn't, and you might or might not either. So if this comes your way, look around for meatier fare before settling in, or even consider taking down a good book from the shelf and do a bit of reading instead.

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Of wit there is little but it'll do
","Oh dear, I feel such a heel writing this, but The Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy just isn't very good, although, ironically, it can in parts be very funny. It all comes down to what you want I suppose, and, sorry, but I like a little wit, of which there is none in this offering. If you want to send up vacuous TV journalism – and for all its empty-headed vanities, it doesn't really head any particular list of world greatest evil's as an obvious target of satire – that job was done far better by Broadcast News. If you merely want to raise a laugh or two, well, you could do worse. But for my money you could also do a lot better. Will Ferrell and Adam McKay and the rest cut their teeth on Saturday Night Live (which, living in Britain, I have never seen) and that figures because in many ways The Anchorman is episodic with its stars merely repeating their various schtick from that series. If there's a story of sorts, it merely serves the purpose of linking those different comedy episodes together. This isn't in any way bad, it just isn't particularly outstanding. Two and a half cheers.",5,0,1,5 September 2010
Hancock," Standard feelgood end treacle makes it a less good than it might have been.
","Why does Hollywood always insist on a happy ending? Why? Yes, I know the bottom line is bucks and nothing but bucks, but doesn't someone in Tinseltown have the wit to make a movie which will keep the cash tills rolling and, for once, still avoid the buckets of treacly sentimentality which Hollywood has made its own? Someone, somewhere please! Hancock is a very good case in point. It is not your usual run of the mill film, it has several nice twists, there is a certain originality in the story and it seems set to break the mould and end on a downbeat, although not one which would be too downbeat. But no, we can't have that, can we. The Western World wants to believe in the Tooth Fairy and sundry notions that it will all come good in the end, so Hancock, too, is obliged to go down the road of slushy sentimentality and end up on a cheery note, so that the punters can 'feel good'. Perhaps there's something wrong with me that my heart actually sinks when everything ends up white picket fences and fresh apple pie. The irony is that Hancock has a good story to tell and at its centre is something of an enigma. The special effects are also something else, and although everyone and his dog now knows that the magic is nothing but several hundred special effects artists spending several months behind their Apple Macs, there's is still that wow factor. How do they do it, how do they have superhero Hancock smash into buildings and take huge chunks out of the masonry? Computers, of course. Yeah, right — but how? Look elsewhere for a synopsis of Hancock. It always seems rather daft to spend most of these reviews retelling what happened. Will Smith is, as always, Will Smith and I have always liked Will Smith, ever since his Fresh Prince days. It would be good to see him stretch himself a little with some character acting but . . . Charlize Theron deserves a great deal of credit for allowing several close-ups to be used which show her skin is less than perfect, but she is, after all, of Afrikaner stock and such people are at tad more down to earth than your average nubile Mid-West wannabe. Don't let me put you off this film (especially, of course, if you are in the majority and are something of a sucker for sentimental, schlocky closure) but all I can say is that I have a niggling suspicion the Hancock, in other hands, produced in another culture could have been a far better film. As it is it gets 6/7 out of 10.",6,0,2,27 August 2009
Shooter," Total b*****s and that's being kind
","The opening shots of Shooter promise a reasonably tidy film. But from there on in it all goes downhill very fast indeed. No cliché is avoided, including the ubiquitous Ned Beatty in his celebrated corrupt senator role. I shan't waste time pointing out the various plot absurdities, not the least of which is the almost miraculous recovery of our man Mark Wahlberg from wounds fired from a handgun at almost point-blank range. Not only does survive a jump from several stories up, he then hijacks a car, is involved in a car chase - all the time apparently bleeding to death - plunges into the Delaware river, eludes and all-out man hunt, makes his way to Kentucky - and still has not bled to death - undergoes home surgery at the hands of his former buddy's widow - oh, I give up. It just gets worse and worse. Most certainly there will be many out there with brains the size of a pea who will cheer Shooter to high heaven. My advice is to give it a miss.",3,4,9,3 March 2012
Inception," Rollicking ride, great twist on your heist movie
","Inception is quite a clever film, though not perhaps in the way you might assume. It is clever because at heart it is nothing but an imaginative variation on the standard heist movie which might convince many that there is far more to it. That isn't to say it isn't hugely entertaining and enjoyable, but despite its subject matter – or rather its purported subject matter – intellectually it is as deep as a small puddle. And it is very much in writer/director Christopher Nolan's favour that, despite the apparently intricate nature of the plot, at no point does he try to pretend Inceptio is anything more than just a spectacular blockbuster. As for the heist movie, well, all the elements are there: the one last job (in this case success will allow the hero home to see the children he has not seen for a while – though as they are still young when he does see them again, it can't be have been that long), the team of 'experts' he puts together for the one last job – the master of disguise, the chemist, the sassy lass good at puzzles – and then the hero's fatal flaw, which we are promised could well jeopardise the whole shooting match. It doesn't, of course, but then in this kind of film it never does. So the template is the old conventional one, and all the film-flam about 'sharing dreams' and 'dreams within dreams within dreams' is just a new kind of decoration Nolan brings to that conventional template. I suppose some might think – though, I'll repeat, I didn't detect any attempt by Nolan to suggest as much – that Inception is some kind of investigation into the nature of reality and, possibly, guilt. Sorry, but it's not: this is your standard heist movie with more imaginative twists. It has it all: the countdown for the job to be done before disaster strikes, the something which goes awry (in this case an aspect of sharing dreams our hero, a very likable DiCaprio has omitted to share with his conspirators), and, this being 2010 (when it was made) very liberal use of CGI special effects. It is to Nolan's credit that those effects are kept well under control and serve the film rather than the film being a vehicle for clever-clever effects. My account is beginning to sound a little sour, so let me stress again that Inception is vastly entertaining and highly enjoyable. OK, so the team of experts are, at best, two-dimensional with no back story of any kind and, as usual the baddies are appalling shots who don't seem to be on target once despite blasting off enough ammo to keep a minor civil war going for several weeks. Oh, and the mysterious metal suitcase with all the buttons to press to get the whole dream-sharing spiel underway is never explained – dammit. But what the hell. Others, as is pretty much standard practice on IMDb are extremely generous with the ratings as though Nolan had set a new benchmark in entertainment, and if I am not quite as liberal, don't blame the film, blame me for being less inclined to join the parade. If you are thinking of catching Inception at your local fleapit, go for it – it is a rollicking two hours.",7,0,5,5 January 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Ignore the lukewarm critics: this is good, solid, entertaining fare
","You've got to feel a little bit sorry for director Guy Ritchie: it seems whatever he does, it isn't right. Why? Well, it's not what he does which is at fault, but because he's Guy Ritchie. Just as some people - directors, politicians, sports people, anyone, really - seem never to lose the public's adoration (Quentin Tarantino has quite successfully overcome the appalling turkey of a film which was Glorious Basterds for no other reason, apparently, but that he is Quentin Tarantino), others somehow get off on the wrong foot and after that are never really forgiven. I have only seen one other Guy Ritchie film and that wasn't half bad. I'm told he has made a couple of duds, but I am in no position to judge. His other failing, of course, is that he married Madonna, although why that should be held against him - and it is - is a mystery to me. But Ritchie is Ritchie, so the logic goes, so his new take on Sherlock Holmes can't be all that good. Too flash, bang, wallop say some. Nothing like the Holmes conceived by Conan Doyle, say others. In fact, there are any number of complaints and criticisms of Ritchie's version, each one, it seems to me, pickier than the last. Ebert liked it but gives it only three stars, and other critics were all too often distinctly lukewarm. Well, my advice is to have none of it. I don't give a monkeys whether or not Ritchie's Holmes is 'true to the 'tec we all love and know'. He's a fictional character, for heaven's sake, and Ritchie is free to do with him what he wants. Then there are the complaints that there is too much fighting, that the film seems to go from one set piece punch-up to another. Granted, there is a lot of fisticuffs, but why isn't that charge levelled against other, in my opinion, far inferior dreck? As far as I'm concerned Ritchie has nothing to be ashamed of and a lot to feel proud of. His take on the Holmes franchise - no deerstalker in sight, thank goodness - is a rattling good tale, reasonably puzzling and imaginatively conceived. His production designer's Victorian London has come up trumps (with skilfully used CGI) and the rather cinematic look of the film - dark browns and shadow - works well with that London. The plot is a reasonably ingenious one, and I particularly liked Mark Strong's villain who comes across as an amalgam of would-be Nazi dictator (just look at the haircut) and Dracula. Robert Downey and Jude Law work well together and make a convincing Holmes and Watson and there is a lightness to the whole operation which rather pleased me. Ritchie's film sets out to entertain and does so, admirably, and doesn't take itself to seriously, which I feel is something the professional critics do a little. So go for it. There's absolutely noting wrong with Ritchie's take and a great deal that is right. The good news is that a sequel is already in the can.",Null,0,1,30 September 2011
The Good Shepherd," Far better and more subtle than many give it credit for
","By chance I watched The Russia House and The Good Shepherd almost one after the other, and although ostensibly they deal with the world of spying, they are very different films. The Russia House, the film of John le Carre's novel, is a love story set in the declining days of the Cold War. In its portrayal of the operations of the CIA and MI6 and its story of how an essentially decent British man decides to betray his country for the love of a woman, it is interesting enough. But at the end of the day it is conventional, well-made Saturday-night-at-the-flicks fodder. The Good Shepherd, on the other hand, is far darker and more ambitious, and from us, the viewer, it demands patience and, dare I say it, intelligence.When it was released, it did not fare particularly well among those critics who criticise for a living. It is too long, they complained, it is too dark, they said. As the central character, Matt Damon is 'wooden', some claimed. Finally and most damningly, they chorus that the film's conclusions - that isn't spying quite a nasty profession and look how it damages those involved? - are simply too slight for a film of this magnitude which clocks in at over two and a half hours.Well, have none of it. In this viewer's opinion, The Good Shepherd is worth every one of its 247 minutes and is far more nuanced and subtle than those who criticise for a living allow. (The verdict among IMDb users ranges from the usual 'awesome, magnificent, a masterpiece' to 'man, this sucks, it's two hours out of my life I've lost forever'. As usual, extremes rule absolutely.)There is a lot going on in this, Robert De Niro's second film as a director, and it seems to me that those who criticise for a living seem to forget that a 'serious' film is not just expected to make 'serious' points, but must succeed in other ways, as a film, as a visual work of art. And The Good Shepherd does so, too, Perhaps I am more patient than many of those who criticise for a living, but from the opening shot until its ultimately tragic ending, I was carried along not by 'the story', but the style and look of the film, by the acting. It was criticised for having no suspense.Really? Not the film I watched. I dislike providing a potted synopsis of the films I review in these pages, but to give my opinions context, I should write that The Good Shepherd portrays the early life of a fictional character, a gifted Yale student of poetry who is recruited into the World War II Office of Strategic Services and how he becomes a founder member of OSS's successor, the Central Intelligence Agency.That portrayal is framed by the fiasco of the CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba to topple Fidel Castro, the realisation that the operation had somehow been betrayed and the hunt of the betrayer. In parallel we are shown how that fictional character (called Edward Wilson in the film but assumed to be based on the CIA's James Angleton) is inducted into the equally secretive Skull and Bones society at Yale whose members pledge each other eternal loyalty and two of whom co-found the CIA with Wilson.But there is far more to The Good Shepherd than some Sunday-supplement pseudo psycho-analysis of the 'secret world'. From early childhood Wilson is a damaged man, emotionally virtually inert, who is continually warned by those close to him both always to celebrate loyalty and never to trust anyone, and who never - as, of course, he couldn't and none of us can - manages to reconcile those mutually exclusive pieces of advice.It doesn't help that he feels continually betrayed: by his father whose suicide he more or less witnesses, by his Yale poetry tutor, by his German translator, so he, in turn, also begins a career of betrayal, although in Wilson's case it is almost inadvertent and personal: the woman who might well have made him happy, the WASP wife who tricked him into marriage but sincerely loved him, and finally and most tragically, the son who followed him into the CIA to gain dad's love and approval. The film is also about relationships, the irony being that Wilson is incapable of sustaining personal relationships but has several successful relationships with those who care nothing about him, notably a shadowy FBI agent and, crucially, a KGB agent who plots to get Wilson to betray his country.There is a great deal more to The Good Shepherd than, I feel, too many allow, and I have touched on very little. The Good Shepherd is a rich film, but it doesn't boast or bellow its achievements from the rooftops. It is long because it is obliged to take its time to develop, and it is none the worse for that.I don't believe it did well at the box office (blame the critics) but I suspect that in time its real value as an engrossing film and - deep breath - a cinematic work of art will be recognised. De Niro and all those involved have nothing to be ashamed of, despite that rabble of those who criticise for a living. Indeed, they have a great deal to be proud of. Two minor quibbles: if the producers chose to hire Britain's Michael Gambon as an old secret service queen who's bumped off as being inconvenient to the OSS and MI6, why not hire a Brit for the role of Arch Cummings? And rather too enthusiastic editing means that one or two points are not clear. But I stress these are minor points. There is a lot to take in in The Good Shepherd and my advice is not just to go and see it, but to go and see it at least twice.",8,1,3,13 September 2011
Arrival," Sorry, but this kind of undercooked, cod philosophical stuff doesn't achieve very much at all
","To be honest, Arrival probably isn't intended for the likes of me: I suspect its cod philosophical theory of time and faux-profound message of world peace is more intended for idealistic young teens and folk who like a bit of little bit of deep thinking between their soaps. Me, I prefer either no depth at all and just plenty of action, or real depth which treats me as an adult and can't be having this kind of cartoon-style theorising which is intended to impress but leaves you none the wiser (and, frankly, more than a little baffled).Having said that – and having pretty much dismissed the contents – the packaging by director Denis Villeneuve (who made 2015's far more impressive Sicario) is handsome enough and the cast do what is required of them if not much else: Amy Adams, plain enough to be convincing, adds a certain understated anguish as the super-brainy university linguist summoned by the military to help try to communicate with visiting mysterious aliens. Oh, and she was also the single mother of a young teen who succumbed to some unidentifiable affliction.Forest Whitaker is a gruff, no-nonsense colonel who collects her in the middle of the night to take her to the mysterious aliens' mysterious vessel in mysterious Montana, but then has very little else to do. Jeremy Renner charms enough as the scientific companion to Adams's linguist, but he again does pretty much nothing except spout the occasional cod science and offer support to Adams when he realised things are getting tough on her (and eventually becomes her love interest in one of the least persuasive romances I've seen on screen).Then there's Michael Stuhlbarg as – well, what exactly? His character is so peripheral, underwritten and underplayed that it's hard to know. You gather he is something of a villain, the government 'agent' in charge, because when Adams hits upon an easy- peasy way of achieving world peace, he's apparently not interested. Or something. The set- up is intriguing enough to hold your interest for a while: 12 extremely mysterious spacecraft (looking very much like smooth, but huge, brazil nuts in their shells, but I don't think we are intended to read too much into that) suddenly appear around the world, but the world is none the wiser as to why. They do not seem to threaten, but without somehow communicating with their inhabitants, the world is at a loss as to what to do next. Enter Adams, who had previously helped the US military with her knowledge of Farsi, and is tasked with getting through to the aliens to find out just why they came.She does exactly that, and although there is no apparent timescale, the rise of civil unrest around the world in view of the alien visitors and their government's inaction makes is seem like it all takes place in a matter of days or possibly weeks. But our Amy's the gal, and don't you know it, she cracks it and is communicating with the seven tentacle but otherwise super-intelligent aliens like old friends! Yes, folks, that's Hollywood for you! It's a wonder the US government doesn't simply hand over all its research to the good folk of Tinseltown because these guys and gals are really no slouches.The problem with Arrival is that it is neither fish nor fowl: the little action there is is a throwaway scene when a small group of military, fired up by right-wing TV commentators urging action, explode a bomb in the spacecraft but very little is made of that at all. In other ways it is all so sadly undercooked: the special effects and the realisation of the aliens is impressive but oddly irrelevant. The surprisingly simple – and extremely fast - deconstruction of their 'language', which also provides the key to their visit just doesn't convince. (By comparison, Jodie Foster's Contact which covers similar territory and is equally woolly still manages to persuade you of something or other.)I have already admitted that I suspect I am not the target audience for this kind of good-looking melange. You might well be, and certainly other reviews here are far more enthusiastic. But if, like me, you – well, I shan't bang on. Sadly, Arrival, for all its production values strikes me as an opportunity missed.",6,6,9,11 June 2017
Centurion," Rather hoary old hokum, but it should do the biz for those who like that kind of thing
","It would be rather too easy to poke gentle fun at Centurion, and I'm afraid it's a temptation I shall find impossible to resist, but although I've read that it was made on a budget - £10 million is regarded as rather a small budget in the film-making world, I gather - that is not obvious, so it deserves a little respect.Writer/director Neil Marshall has used his imagination well and I doubt whether an extra £90 million would have made much difference, if any at all. All in all it is more or less a piece of Boys' Own hokum about a bunch of Roman soldiers, the sole survivors of a massacre by the Picts of Rome's Ninth Legion, who have to make their way home through a very inhospitable Scotland, all the while tracked by a posse of vicious Picts led by a mute woman who has nothing on her mind at all but revenge (and who sports a startling amount of kohl on her eyelids throughout).In sum, it's a chase film, and there's nothing much wrong with that if that's your bag. Unfortunately, it isn't mine unless there's a little more and here there isn't. Characterisation is minimal and there's no plot to speak off.Aspects of the film which left me underwhelmed were just how fast and loose Marshall played with Scottish geography: one minute our intrepid gang of Romans are several thousand feet high crossing a snowy mountain, and barely ten minutes later they are trekking through the kind of dense woodland you will not find in the Highlands. I hate to disillusion non-Brits, but there's an awful lot of rather dull countryside in the middle of Scotland before you get to the Highlands (and for the record I rather like The Borders).I am also always disconcerted in these films by how men who are living rougher than you and I will ever have the misfortune to live manage to remain more or less clean-shaven throughout. Yes, I know that has a lot to do with production schedules and that films are rarely shot in rigid sequence, but it does rather spoil an illusion. I was also rather puzzled as to where our gang of Romans managed to pick up their rather natty furs. But what the hell, Centurion is, after all, nothing more than hoary old hokum and in its favour is that it pretends to be nothing more. OK, much of the dialogue is quotably heroic and at times a little ponderous but, but who knows, perhaps the Romans were rather like that.And here's a spoiler: the hero gets the girl. I shan't tell you how - for that you'll have to watch the film yourselves. But it is reassuring how some staples of film can never be ignored.",5,1,5,1 March 2014
Prometheus," 24-carat b*llocks with great CGI (if that's your thing. Me, I like a little more)
","Ridley Scott does know how to put on a spectacle, but in Prometheus, a kind of Alien prequel, he seems to have forgotten how to tell a tale. And no amount of CGI jiggery-pokery, flashing lights, super-modern looking spaceships and the rest can make up for a poor tale very badly told.Setting the scene is rudimentary if not an insult to the viewer, the characters are two-dimensional stereotypes with not an ounce of motivation among them, plot elements are peremptorily introduced merely to justify one scene, then forgotten, and to call the the whole storytelling aspect to this film a complete mess would be pulling one's punches. What was Ridley Scott thinking?Prometheus will surely satisfy any young viewer under the age of 13 who will take on trust what goes on and instinctively understand it all. Those over 13, though, will find themselves increasingly looking at their watch and wondering how much longer it will go on.I shan't spend a moment pointing out the ridiculous plot holes, inconsistencies and the rest, because that would be futile. And ironically a good film can get away with and be forgiven plot holes and inconsistencies, but Prometheus isn't that film: it is superficial bombastic nonsense with barely a redeeming feature except the special effects and those are now ten a penny in all Tinseltown blockbusters. Sad, but true.",4,4,5,26 August 2016
Blow," Dull, dull, dull and that's just the interesting bits
","I have no idea what the protocol is on reviewing films here, but I do imagine you must actually have seen the film before you are able to post a review, and the IMDb staffers who toil daily and nightly to bring these are scribblings to a grateful public assume that you have done so. But what if you did not see all of the film? What if the film you are reviewing was so damn dull, so damn unengaging that you gave up halfway and went off to find something better to do - the washing up, perhaps, or comb the dog for fleas. Perhaps you were so damn bored by the film that instead you decided to seek out the nearest newly-painted wall and sit before it for several hours to keep an eye on the paint as it dried.I have no idea why Blow was so dull and unengaging, but dull and unengaging it was and I would happily have swapped the 35 minutes or so of it I did watch for some more interesting pastime (learning by heart next week's TV schedule, perhaps). I was drawn to it because Johnny Depp and Ray Liotta, two of my favourite actors, are in it. But even they couldn't save it.Another reviewer here complained that the film was morally suspect in that it didn't condemn drug-taking and, in fact, almost seemed to condone it. Well, I shall not make the same complaint. But I shall point out that because several million folk in the U.S. and Europe are keen to be kept supplied with weed and coke, it is thriving, multi-billion pound industry. And because so many billions can be made producing, transporting and dealing in weed and coke those doing the producing, transporting and dealing manage to get by on as few scruples as possible. Oh, and they aren't at all bothered that a great many innocent people as well a great many of their own kind are murdered in cold blood to keep the industry going. If you want to be really shocked, google the figures of how many lives the drug trade has claimed in, say, the past ten years in Mexico, Colombia and surrounding states. You'll find they are in the the tens if not hundreds of thousands. Given that fact, the jokey tone of the film was to put it mildly utterly inappropriate.That is not, however, the film's worst failing. It's worst failing is that it is dull, dull, dull. Or at least the 35-odd minutes I could be bothered to watch. Quite how Blow gets an average 7.5 rating is beyond me.",3,0,0,12 October 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Overblown, bombastic nonsense redeemed by very little
","I don't doubt it will be regarded as total heresy to say so, but The Dark Knight Rises is confused, muddled, bombastic nonsense.I remember quite liking Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, not rating The Dark Knight very much, but this, the conclusion of Nolan's trilogy (there were other, to my mind more successful, editions of the franchise) really doesn't take off. And the only folk we can blame are director Christopher Nolan who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan. (I don't much like Christian Bale, and never have, who seems to take himself just a tad too seriously in whatever role he plays, but that is, at present, beside the point.)To be blunt the film is a mess from the plot up. I'm not even too sure what the story is: what is going on? I'll leave to one side ludicrous elements such as how Batman/Bruce Wayne manages to heal himself after having his back broken and, once escaping his jail in India, somehow gets to Gotham City within a day; or who and what are Daggett and Stryver, introduced as apparently essential part of the story, then dispensed with in a trice; or 'Dr Pavel'; or the about-turn of Miranda from being Batman's love interest to being the villain of the piece in an odd twist on the deus ex machine ruse.But on it goes, from one careless obscure detail to another. And this is great filmmaking? Where is the rooting for the good guys we expect in such a blockbuster aimed at the adolescent in all of us? Where is the suspense? What suspense there was is so synthetically contrived that there's no suspense at all.There are some good things in it and some good actors (and why are Aidan Gillen - who I didn't even notice - and Cillian Murphy, two fine actors, reduced to bit parts of no consequence whatsoever?) But none of them do anything to redeem the film.In previous incarnations Batman was played by Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney. I haven't seen the Clooney version, but in those earlier films the whole exercise did not take itself too seriously and they were enjoyable and cartoonish. Under Nolan that has changed: it is all so ponderously, bombastically done that where there should be a liveliness, a sense of fun, the heart of it all is dead. By all means see it (if you are reading this to decide whether it is worth your time), but you have been warned. It isn't at all good.",4,1,3,17 April 2014
Casino Royale," Better than the previous ones, but . . .
","I hate to be a grumpy boots, but this Bond left me distinctly underwhelmed, despite reading of the plaudits awarded by other movie critics. In fact, I had given up on the Bond franchise years ago: I simply wasn't in the slightest entertained by the silly story lines, the leaden and very obvious puns, the improbable violence and and overall cartoonish feel to the films. In fact, I haven't even seen a Bond film with Dalton in it, only a few with Connery and only one with Roger Moore. Why watch this one? Well, the critics DID all say it was a leap forward and, anyway, my wife had bought it on DVD. So I settled into bed, switched on my laptop and was prepared to discover that true redemption is even possible in the tacky world of movie-making. Well, the good things first. Long gone, thank goodness, are the truly awful puns and the incessant. remorseless jokiness which always left me cold. Stylistically, the franchise had finally moved with the times and if nothing else the film, from the point of view of craftsmanship, is very well made. Daniel Craig is a very different Bond, though I, for one, still find it impossible to swallow the central Bond myth that 007 is 'licensed to kill' without which he is just another film hero. And I still remain unconvinced by the look Craig gives Bond - he might be togged up in a tux and all that, but he still looks as though he has just walked off the nearest building site. This Bond is no toff, and I always thought Bond was meant to be a toff. Well, there is plenty of action, though not a great deal makes that much sense and the chase sequences do go on a little too long. And then, just as I thought we were going to get an explanation for all the tooing and frooin - the film ends. What! Just what was going on? It was though we got only half a film. Perhaps I am no longer in the demographics at whom this kind of film is aimed. Perhaps I never was. All I can say is that as an actioner, this isn't half bad, but if you are looking for anything more - such as an intelligent, intelligble plot - look elsewhere. As for all the guff that Bond is a 'new man', a man who can get in touch with his feelings despite the expensive hardware he is given by MI6, all I can say is: who cares. First of all I want a proper story. Without that everything else is fluff and nonsense. Sorry.",6,0,3,9 August 2008
Identity," If you want a top-notch thriller and mystery, this is the one
","There's hokum and there's hokum, which is to say there's bad hokum and good hokum. Identity, directed by James Mangold and written by Michael Cooney, is top-class, 24-carat, Grade A+++ hokum, the real McCoy. And that is meant as outright praise. From the intriguing opening shots to the final scene which, in a sense, wraps it all up, Identity scores big time. Other IMDb reviewers have criticised the film for its cod - and thus very wrong - psychology as regards the psychopathology of multiple personality disorder sufferers (or whatever the correct clinical name is). The only response to that is: who cares? If films always tried to get the psychology right, there would be far fewer films. Who cares? is my response to the occasional plot hole, but I shan't even bother listing them here, as the exercise would be pointless. Nor will I outline in tedious detail what happens, as to my tastes is too often the practice here. If you feel you need to know that before watching Identity, then please look elsewhere. I will simply say that Mangold's film is a very clever and very entertaining mix of thriller, suspense, horror and whodunit, with even the occasional dark joke. For this reviewer John Cusack and Ray Liotta are always a joy to watch, but the rest of the cast, not least Amanda Peet, complement their fine performances well. Fundamentally, the success of Identity is rooted in a clever, well-plotted and, in its way, rather original story by Cooney. But that story, made into a film, might well have died on its feet in lesser hands than those of Mangold. And even then it might not have been so hugely entertaining were it not for the cast, each of whom is, to some extent, a stereotype (what stage, novel or film character isn't?), but each of which is brought superbly to life and given a distinct identity by the actor who portrays him or her. I bought the DVD of Identity after watching Mangold's remake of 3.10 To Yuma which I enjoyed a lot. I have also bought, but not yet watched Cop Land, which, however, garnered less critical praise. But Mangold (who works with his producer wife Cathy Konrad) is a director to watch. But at the end of the day Identity's success is rooted in the screenplay by Cooney. If you like being entertained, held in suspense, if you like horror and intelligent whodunits, Identity is the film for you.",8,2,3,6 October 2009
The Sixth Sense," Fair enough, but not the work of genius some claim
","I hate to be a party pooper, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The Sixth Sense is an entertaining film, better than some, not as good as others, but it is most certainly not the masterpiece many seem to make it out to be. (Nor, for that matter, is it as bad as many here suggest.) If anything it is an intriguing story, and not original at that - read The Third Policeman - which is realised in a somewhat perfunctory way by Shaymalan. If anything it could have been done better. When I was considering my view of the film, the word 'ponderous' occurred to me more than once, and I think that is about right. The Sixth Sense needed a more delicate touch and, well, it should have been spookier. Having said all that the young lad who portrays young Cole, the boy who can see the dead, give an outstanding performance, and for once an American director has successfully resisted the temptation to make a child more cloying than a mug of treacle. His mother also does well as a harassed single mother, and Bruce Willis shows that there is more to his ability than shooting guns and posing in sweaty T shirts. But I have to repeat: The Sixth Sense is great for a night in but not the earth-shattering Meisterwerk others claim it to be. If anything, there is any number of plot holes which become rather glaring once the film has finished and overall it doesn't quite stack up as it should. But what the hell: that would be serious is it came anyway close to being a work of genius. As it doesn't, those plot holes don't really matter.",6,2,3,7 March 2011
RED," Utterly ludicrous over the top hokum but none the worse for that. At least it entertains
","Somewhere in the opening credits we are told that RED is based on a graphic novel, and I also notice DC Comics logo in there somewhere. That is the key to it all: keep that well in mind if you decide to see this and you probably won't be disappointed. IMDb bills it as a drama, comedy and a thriller, and I suppose that is more or less a reasonable description, although is in not top-notch drama, laugh-out-loud funny or particularly suspenseful. You do, however, want to know what is going on and why it is going on. RED is entertaining enough, but something of a big-budget pot boiler. Bruce Willis does this sort of hard man act standing on his head and I should imagine Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich had rather pressing bills to settle because throughout they are slumming it. But what the hell. RED has no pretensions and if it is nothing but way, way over-the-top 23 carat hokum it is none the worse for that. Take it with a couple of pinches of salt, have several cans of lager to hand and resign yourself to passing a couple of very undemanding hours.",Null,1,2,7 August 2011
Flight," Good in parts but not what it could well have been. But Washington is excellent
","Flight is an odd film, which takes you along for the ride, but which soon has you asking pertinent questions almost as soon as the credits roll.That notwithstanding, what is outstanding about Flight is Denzel Washington in the main role as an alcoholic, coke-snorting pilot in denial who might well have saved the almost 200 lives through his flying skill but who faces several years in jail when a toxicology report shows up the booze and coke in his blood while flying. But Washington aside – though it has to be said that the performances are of the highest order – there seems in retrospect very little 'plot' or 'story' to Flight. In a nutshell it is that 'brave alcoholic pilot finals admits to himself that he is an addict'.So did we need nigh on two hours of this and that to get to that point. Well, no we did not. And that is to say, apart from the obvious reason of making money for the studio, there seems very little reason to make Flight. Outstanding is the crashing of an airliner which, more or less, opens the film. And if you saw the trailer, which, I understand, makes great use of those crash scenes, the film will undoubtedly come as an anti-climax. What is not so good is the putative nascent relationship with a recovering heroin addict – and boy do Hollywood junkies still look good and if they are women, pretty. I didn't buy it, although what with Washingon being black and the lass who falls for him white, Flight should at least be praised from being – in 2013! – one of only a handful of films which show that love is colour blind. Usually, the black hero has to have a black woman.Another weak point, another exceptionally weak point is including John Goodman as an in-your-face, larger than life dealer who supplies Washington with his uppers, downers and everything in between. As played by Goodman – that is Goodman playing the one role he seems these days solely hired to play – the dealer character seems like an intruder from a different film. And don't even start to ask why an airline pilot who has a lot to lose should his addictions become public should ever consider throwing in his lot with a loudmouth dealer as portrayed by Goodman. In fact, the Goodman character strikes me as a production decision, an element to jazz it all up a little. But it doesn't, it just diminishes the film. And the final scene in which Washington is apparently reconciled with his son is simply hamfisted and probably tacked on to elecit a tear or two from the daytime TV generation who like a little ersatz emotion.How many stars to give Flight? Well, five would be unkind, because in many ways, not least the spectacular crash and Washington's performance, it is better than average. But if I give it six, be warned that it could have been a lot, lot better had someone somewhere had a little more courage and made the film which should have been made.",6,2,3,3 February 2013
Munich," Admirably evenhanded, but ...
","The film Munich is fiction, although it's fiction based on fact. How much is fact and how much is fiction I don't know. But then there is also the important point that some fiction — honest fiction — can contain and convey as much truth as fact and that 'fact' is all too often something of a moveable feast: one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, a distinction which is relevant in Steven Spielberg's film Munich. The acts of terrorism it portrays, the slaughter of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, and the subsequent vengeance meted out by Israel, is so wholly horrifying that to talk of film as entertainment would be obscene. Thankfully, Spielberg is such an outstanding and sensitive filmmaker that at no point does one feel that Munich is in any way intended to entertain. He also attempts, and, I think, largely succeeds — despite himself being Jewish — to remain evenhanded. No one comes out of this smelling of roses, not the Palestinians, not the Israelis, not the shadowy French middlemen and not (their roles are oblique but by no means unimportant) the Soviet KGB and the US CIA, both cynically involving themselves for their own ends. And although of necessity any moral discussion of what the Palestinians do and how Israel reacts cannot in such a film be too detailed, Spielberg also, in my view, admirably remains neutral. As a 'document', although a fictional 'document', Munich gets the cigar. But as a film, I have various quibbles. Visually and narratively and in so many other ways Munich is never short of excellent. Spielberg as an almost innate gift and, for example, tension is organic and not racked up artificially, as is the way of some filmmakers, by all kinds of flammery backed up by some portenous score. The acting is also superb, especially that of — former Australian stand-up — Eric Bana. What rather jarred with me was the ease with which Bana and his group of assassins can move around with ease, can cause extreme havoc, yet are never troubled by the police or a country's secret service. Obviously, were this long film to spend any time at all establishing matters in all the many countries in which the assassins operate, then it would become even longer. But for me the fatal flaw is the shadowy Frenchmen who facilitate the assassins' work at every turn, locating targets, organising safe houses and the like and without whose assistance the assassins would never even get started. Only two of them have speaking roles, a father ('Pape') and his son 'Louis', although there are obviously far more of them. To put it bluntly, they play the role of deus ex machina (although they appear throughout the film rather than at then end to effect some kind of resolution) and without them Spielberg wouldn't have a film. These people are the real cynics, working for the best paymaster and even, it is more than suggested, working for both sides merely to make more money. There is a curious piece of cod philosophising by Papa in which he attempts to justify his cynical approach by suggesting that all governments are 'bastards', but this is such cartoonish stuff that it can hardly be taken seriously. But that is a criticism — and in my book a major criticism — of the 'film' Munich. There is, though, more to Munich than that, and I am prepared to accept that others might not share my sensitivity to such a detail. And that apart, Munch is an extraordinarily good film, not least because it is — my quibble apart — also an honest film.",7,1,3,30 April 2010
Heat," There's less to this than meets the eye
","It seems almost churlish to say so given the big movie names involved  Pacino, De Niro and Michael Mann, but, depending on what you want from a film, Heat, isn't really that good. As usual here in IMDb reviews it gets both 10/10 an just 1/10. Well, both are off mark. I have given it 4/10 because  well  as a movie spectacle it does the business and then some. The trouble is that Mann apparently wanted to make more than just a intelligent crook v an intelligent cop movie. Mann wanted to inject meaning. Well, he hasn't unless you're the kind of guy or gal who thinks that your average R&B pop video is meaningful. That's not to say, of course, that this is merely on the level of such a video, only that it has the same spurious significance. The usual cliché is that you often have to suspend disbelief to enjoy a tale, and Heat demands that a lot of disbelief is suspend. For one thing there is no back story: we are presented with a range of characters and must either accept them or not. But how did De Niro, portrayed as rather an intelligent cove get into crime when undoubtedly his intelligence and character would have made him a success in many more legitimate areas. On the other hand, he is remarkably ruthless, is apparently incapable of forming relationships (until he meets a girl who he thinks might be 'it'), and can see himself pursuing no other career than crime. Then there's Pacino: wedded to the job, his third marriage going down the pan, the man is an interesting case history. But no explanation is offered as to why this should be. Well, you might say, none is needed. Just accept those two characters and enjoy the action. In that case, why does Mann introduce the theme of relationship, their hold over us, their strength, their weaknesses? What was needed was another film which would examine that theme at length  but then Mann would not have had his action movie. So if that is what you want, enjoy it. But don't be taken in by the faux philosophical nature of the movie.",4,5,12,28 July 2008
300," Quite a laugh really. Take it with a pinch of salt, relax and enjoy
","Whether you like, enjoy, rate or simply hate 300 depends almost entirely on what you expect. Don't expect history. Apart from the fact that the hero is the Spartan king Leonidas, fetchingly portrayed by a muscle-bound Scotsman in skimpy shorts and a cape, and the film portrays - very loosely - the historical battle of Thermopylae when a tiny Grecian force held a far larger Persian force at bay, this is more fiction than fact. For example, and quite crucially: a lot is made of 'freedom' in 300, that no Spartans will bow to the Persians etc blah, blah. 21st century demotic thought at its finest, paper-thin and millimetre deep. And fair enough: banging the drum about 'freedom' and 'liberty' always goes down well in the freedom and liberty-loving West which values freedom and liberty so much, it is prepared to sacrifice whole nations in the quest to introduce democracy to the world. The speech given by Leonidas's queen to the senate could have been written in the White House four years ago when it desperately tried to justify it invasion of Iraq. More pertinently for Hollywood, of course, a liberal use of the word freedom lends a spurious philosophical glamour to any dross they care to churn out. But inconveniently, Sparta had nothing to do with freedom: only one in five of the inhabitants of Sparta were free men. The rest, or most of them, were Helots, slaves who at a certain time of the year could be killed by any Spartan with impunity. So much for 'freedom'. But as I say, if you are looking for fact, don't bother with 300. If you expect a literary script, again the only sensible advice is to avoid 300. It you are averse to the graphic portrayal of gore, although gore redeemed by being so highly stylised that it is largely unreal, don't bother. If, on the other hand, you are quite entertained by slasher movies, sword and sorcery and all things Tolkienian (does the word exist?), give 300 whirl. Oddly enough I don't like slasher movies, sword and sorcery or all things Tolkienian at all, but as a piece of superior bubblgegum movie-making and movie-watching 300 somehow hits the spot. It is, it has to be said, complete and utter cobblers (and that is not an obscene word, dear American friends). But what I like is that it has no pretensions whatsoever. None at all. It follows in the tradition of Sin City, another film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, and its scenes (I read) follow the graphic panels of the novel virtually seamlessly. And that is the key to it. 300, like Sin City, is the graphic novel in movie form. Naturally, simply because it is a 'comic' doesn't mean it need not have literary quality but nor does it mean that it should have one either. The dialogue is almost of the 'Me Tarzan, you Jane' school of writing with one or two lines of cod philosophy. But neither is there a necessity that it should have a great script, and to criticise 300 because it doesn't have one misses the point entirely as does taking the film seriously on any intellectual level whatsoever. This is film-making, for goodness sake, money-making, entertainment. Viewed with that in mind and 300 can be forgiven quite a lot. So if it is way, way, way over the top, from the CGI-enhanced muscles of the Spartans and Xerxes, all metal piercing, eyeshadow and chains who is surely a gay icon somewhere to the quite impossible battle scenes, all of whom were so obviously generated on the latest Apple Macs, who cares. Was it a failing of P T Barnum's extravangazas that the elephants couldn't recite Shelley? 300 is way, way, way over the top and unashamedly proudly over the top, almost like the best drag act you have ever seen. As a piece of film-making 300 is not original - Sin City was merely because it got in there first - but in an odd sort of way it is still satisfying. So it doesn't matter that Leonidas sounds as though he is from Paisley in Scotland, or that Xerxes seems to have just arrived from a rich man's fetish party, or that The Immortals, the Persian king's fearsome bodyguard are superbly ridiculous. Who cares. 300 is an outright romp and none the worse for that. Elsewhere you will read, as always that this is either the best film ever made or so bad the director should have been jailed. It's neither. If you agree to it on its own terms, it is rather good. Shakespeare it ain't, but then anyone who has seen Titus Andronicus will know that sometimes Shakespeare wasn't, either.",7,4,6,24 July 2009
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Something of a high-wire act, but one pulled off with aplomb. Catch it
","I've seen some good films - some very good films - mediocre films and downright bad films, but I know very little about film-making because I've never 'made a film' or been involved in making a film and the chances of me doing so are rather less than celebrating my next birthday on the Moon. But of one thing I'm certain: in many ways film-making is something of a high-wire act: with all the talent in the world at our beck and call it can, and often does, go horribly wrong. There again it can, against rather steep odds, also come off admirably, and with Kingsman: The Secret Service writer/director Mathew Vaughn (and I suspect his long-term co-screenwriter Jane Goldman also deserves a mention) has most certainly pulled off, with apparent ease, a daunting task.First, during the height of the Cold War, we had the straight-faced James Bond films (and others were made at the same time presenting the same sentiments) with those nasty Rusky communists as the 'baddies' and the West and apple pie as the 'goodies, although the Bond franchise began to play if more for laughs, perhaps realising just how ludicrous it all often seemed. Similar ventures, though, most recently the Bourne franchise, carried on playing it straight, but shifted the emphasis away from politics to out-and-out action.Bourne and the rest blatantly catered to the armchair thug in all of us who likes to imagine himself - very rarely herself, I should think - up there with all the smart moves and seemingly inexhaustible energy. Others - Rowan Atkinson, Mike Myers, and just a few months ago Paul Feig with Spy - ditched any pretense of serious intent and simply went for laughs.Vaughn and Goldman - I do think it is best to see them as a team because an excellent script (I am told) is the sine qua non of great film-making - have tried something far more ambitious in the number of angles the cover. Not only do they give us a Bond character battling it out with an evil villain intent on world domination (or, here, world destruction), but at the same time they choose to send it up but without pulling the rug from under their own feet. They also provide all the quite impossible gadgetry we expect a 'Bond' character to have at his disposal - at one point Colin Firth as the central figure takes his protégé (a very capable Taron Egerton) from Savile Row in central London to deepest Hampshire (I should think) in an underground mini bullet train on a journey of at least 30 miles - now how would that have been secretly built at a cost of billions of pounds? And to cap it all, the film flirts with self-reference, a practice that almost always ends in tears but here doesn't.Firth, our 'Bond', and a very watchable Samuel L. Jackson as the evil and mad villain, complete with a ludicrous Mike Tyson lisp, even discuss 'the kind of spy film they watched as kids'. But then Vaughn and Goldman ride a coach and four through many of those films' conventions - when he finally meets Firth, baddie Jackson explains he won't spend several minutes outlining why he is doing what he is doing and he shan't, as was the convention, set up the 'Bond' character to die a lingering death from which our Bond would be bound to escape, he simply . . . well watch the film.But there is even more to Vaughn and Goldman's action-packed spoof than that: they even manage to introduce an additional hero, a very likable lad from the wrong side of the track (Taron Egerton, referred to above) who is set against a gaggle of upper-class toffs and manages to hold his own with aplomb. Portraying the British class system in films and some chipper 'working-class' lad who gets one over the toffs is a high-wire act of its own, but Vaughn and Goldman manage it.Some reviewers here lambast Kingsman for its violence, and I can't deny that there is a great deal of it - to put it bluntly, an awful lot of people die. But, for this viewer at least, the violence isn't in the slightest bit nasty and gratuitous and isn't sadistically lingered upon as is the habit of some grubby film-makers.This film, which is based on a graphic novel, gets away with showing it because it is so utterly unreal and. And one scene in which - spoiler alert - the heads of several hundred of the worlds great and good gathered in villain Jackson's lair all explode like some expensive firework display, played to Edward Elgar's Pomp And Circumstance, had me laughing out aloud: it was all far too ludicrous to cause offence and very funny indeed.Vaughn and Goldman - I still think that although Vaughn directed, both should get equal credit for what we are shown on screen - most certainly pulled off a high-wire act and then some.Undoubtedly luck was involved (as were several hundred other collaborators - I've just looked at the credit list and yet again reflected on just how their essential contributions are never acknowledged), but luck follows talent - you'll never get anywhere on pure luck.Catch this if you can, because you are in for a treat. Yes, it is all quite ludicrous, but in the best possible sense.",7,0,4,20 June 2015
The Thin Red Line," Don't be fooled: this is not very good at all
","Every group has its pantheon of saints whether they are sportsmen, artists, politicians, salesmen, folk singers, bankers, crooks or, of course, film makers. And for those who earn their grubby pennies in the whacky world of making movies Terrence Malik is up there as one of the greatest saints. So criticising the man and his work is not just like giggling at a funeral but dropping your trousers and taking a dump in full view of the corpse. It just isn't done, and anyone who indulges in that kind of behaviour - or dares to criticise St Terrence and one of his films - is quite obviously a candidate for the funny farm. Well, perhaps. And perhaps, in the case of Malik, perhaps not. With this, The Thin Red Line, just what is the man trying to do?It is, by turns, part post-modern war movie, South Sea travelogue, art house something-or-other and even touches on your actual straight-down-the-line gung-ho shoot-em-up before it reminds itself of its pacifist motivation and resorts to art house something-or-other. The technical term for The Thin Red Line is 'a mess' and that is putting it charitably. In another review I warned of the incessant, remorseless wall-to-wall sentimental soundtrack which does its very best to manipulate the feelings and thus the judgment of the viewer, and that warning applies to this film, too. I can best describe the soundtrack as chocolate box church music meets Joe Schmaltz and his Touchy-Feely All-Stars. And that description, too, is somewhat charitable, and for a film of this length - 163 minutes - I suspect the soundtrack composer was paid by the hour.I must confess that I was well on the point of throwing in the towel after about 20 minutes. Someone once said of Richard Wagner that after hearing his music for half an hour, you look at your watch and realise only five minutes have passed. Malik seems to share that same affliction in The Thin Red Line. But I took into account the director's current reputation and decided to stick it out. I could, I told myself, be missing something and Malik deserved an honest hearing. As it turned out, I wasn't and he didn't.I was stumped right from the off by a rather long shot of an alligator/crocodile entering a river and slowly sinking beneath the water. Significant or not? Well, to be honest, I don't know, although as that, or another, alligator/croc turns up in the film for no particularly good reason several hours later, tied to a plank in the back of a truck and surrounded by battle-weary troops on an R&R break, the odds are surely on 'significant'. But don't ask me how or in what way.There followed quite a long digression (it, too, seemed longer than it probably was) of two squaddies relaxing with and relating to a village of South Sea islanders - paddling in the sea, being friendly with the locals, poetically musing on nature, you know, that kind of thing - before the navy show up and we realise the two have gone AWOL. Once interned to the ship's hold, it is then we are led to believe that the film will finally get going. And it does in a kind of way, but, well, not really. One young farm lad confesses to the sergeant that he's scared, another steals a pistol, a third reveals that he was once an officer but was busted to private - Malik is almost in danger of becoming conventional but confirmed cineastes will know full well there's no danger of that. So on it goes.At one point Nick Nolte does a 'is this man mad or just really, really committed' act, but the film isn't about that, either. Gorgeous George Clooney even puts in an appearance as the captain replacing the 'good man' unjustly sent home in disgrace, but after earning his million or two salary for the very brief guest spot, he, too, disappears.What were you trying to do, Mr Malik? Tell us, because I sure as hell don't know. Were you honestly trying to inform us that 'war is bad'? Are you really still not convinced we don't know that? And what was with all the, to my ears insufferably trite, cod 'deep' insights intoned every ten minutes or so in voice-over? Here are three random examples: 'War doesn't ennoble men, it poisons the soul'; 'Love? Where does it come from?'; and 'What's keeping us from reaching out and touching the glory?' That last is especially vacuous. There are well-directed action war sequences which would not disgrace any steak and potatoes action film, but after all the cod philosophising and insights it should seem obvious that Malik is not in the least bit interested in that kind of cinematic titillation. If anyone reading this wants to hear at first hand just how nasty and dehumanising war is, forgot about watching a confused and confusing Malik opus and simply ask your grandfather, father, uncle or brother.For this viewer at least Malik's The Thin Red Line is not just not a masterpiece, it is dangerously close to being an insulting piece of self-indulgence. Malik has a duty to provide us with, at least, the means and context to try to understand what he is attempting to do. If he has made and is presenting a more complex piece than Son Of Rambo Rides Again: The Dinosaurs, Malik is most entitled to expect the viewer to engage his or her intelligence and make something of an effort. But that simply isn't the case with this film. It is simply a mish-mash of sentiment, middle-brow insight, would-be stunning imagery, syrupy music and stock war movie characters, all somehow cemented together with lashings of liberal fellow feeling. And that does not make it a great or even good film. To put it mildly.",3,4,6,2 April 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Very, very entertaining old hokum which is more than a touch better than most
","For once I'll keep this short. It's always very difficult to find a new angle to an old genre, but The Cabin In The Woods, pulls it off. OK, so at the end of the day it is lightweight, utterly illogical, full of plot holes and more than just old hokum - it is 24-carat old hokum - but what's wrong with that? You might ask why a highly sophisticated, modern organisation using the last state-of-the-art technology with, apparently, unlimited resources at its disposal would have provide such straightforward means to ensure its own destruction and that of the world. But if such things are important to you - and, of course, they are in another kind of film - The Cabin In The Woords isn't for you and you'd be advised to try something a great deal worthier. There's absolutely nothing deep about this film, and it does trade in clichés, but that is exactly the - very amusing - point. If you like being entertained and intrigued, this is a film for you. That it succeeds using material which in other hands would result in a run-of-the-mill gore-fest garbage is testament to the skill and wit of its writers and director. It attempts a high-wire act and wins hands down. I won't say more than that. I do, and I enjoyed it a great deal, even though I don't like slasher movies, find that a great deal of sci-fi falls flat at the end of the day and haven't seen an original horror film for quite a few years. I'll say it again: if you like being entertained and intrigued, this is the film for you.",7,0,2,28 September 2012
Beetlejuice," Am I missing something? Because . . .
","Beetlejuice is one of those films you feel guilty about not liking more. Sounds daft, I know, but it's a bit like not liking as much an aunt everyone else insists is a real sweetie, but with the best will in the world you just can't see it. I mean, Beetlejuice is by Tim Burton, right, and an early masterpiece, right; and Michael Keaton in the title role, delivers a barnstorming performance, right; and it's full of examples of Tim Burton's celebrated off-the-wall, wacky humour right, with loads of imaginative special effects, right. And anyway, everyone, and I mean everyone thinks it's really, really good and really, really cool and just, you know, brilliant, I mean really, really brilliant, right. So if you disagree and, you know, you don't get it, it's your problem, man, because everyone else thinks it's really, really cool and really, really brilliant. But unfortunately I don't think it is really, really good and really, really brilliant. The real problem is that I don't think I even have a problem — I just don't think Beetlejuice is quite as good as everyone, and I mean, everyone, right, says. It's rather like Robert De Niro's performance in Mean Streets: everyone says it's pure genius, then you see it, and you think: aren't they exaggerating just a little, I mean, just a little? It's good, yes, but . . . Beetlejuice is this film I had heard so much about, which was truly original and with which Tim Burton first made his name (or something). But I had never seen it because somehow I didn't when it first came out, and then it was never in a cinema near me or else when it was shown on TV, I didn't get to hear about it until it was too late. But I also made a mental note that I simply must see it and when I found that one of our local supermarkets was selling a copy for £4, which is my sort of price, in it went into the shopping basket. In the event, I didn't get to slip it into my DVD player (i.e. my iBook) until a few weeks later, but when I did, I couldn't get rid of the niggling suspicion that I was in for something of a disappointment. Now, it would be pointless to go into chapter and verse pointing out a flaw here and a flaw there, because, quite truthfully Tim Burton does have a rather extraordinary imagination and in many respects Beetlejuice is streets ahead of the competition. You might even say that Burton re-wrote the rules for making films in a certain kind of genre, although I would be hard-pushed to give that genre a name. But let me give just one example: the Maitland's are in so many ways such caricatures that you assume such characterisation will be part of the plot. But it isn't. Then we are presented with the Deetz family and their camp interior designer and again the characterisation is so broadbrush that you wonder just at what level the whole thing is being pitched. Well, actually, it doesn't matter. This is cartoon stuff, except that it doesn't feature animation but acting. OK, fair enough. Then we get to Keaton giving an undoubted tour de force but in an odd sort of way it never really takes off. We are informed that at one point he was someone's assistant but his behaviour became so extreme that he had to be let go. Well, perhaps I'm being a little over-pernickety here, but I want some sort of back story which would help flesh out Beetlejuice. But all we are led to believe is that he should, on no account, be invoked. Naturally, he is invoked, but oddly the film finishes quite soon afterwards (in an ending which involved a deus ex machina of such obviousness that I would bet my shirt the writer simply did not know how to end his story. In fact, apart from the fact that one could dies and wants to scare another couple out of their home, what was the story. When the film came, I was even taken by surprise: was that it? I thought, for although by now Beetlejuice had already been running for 90 minutes odd, in a sense it was only just getting going. But no, that was it, like it or lump it. Perhaps, I am expecting too much. Perhaps I am being too serious. Perhaps I should just relax and get into the spirit of the film (and no silly pun intended there). The trouble is that Beetlejuice could have been so much more. We often say that so-and-so was more than just the sum of its parts, and hope to indicate that it included an x factor which raised it above the rest. Well, for me Beetlejuice is, in a sense, less the sum of its parts. It seemingly has everything, but . . . Oh well, I'll just have to firm a sub-group of those who don't think this is the best thing since sliced bread.",6,13,27,9 April 2009
Up in the Air," Sadly a rather mushy love story, not the satire I was expecting. Oh, well...
","Perhaps I missed something, perhaps Jason Reitman's Up In The Air is more subtle than it seems, but by the time the credits rolled, I felt rather cheated. The style and content of the film's first 60 minutes seemed to promise a spiky satire. Exactly what was to be satirised was not at all clear, but that, too, promised to be revealed in due course. It wasn't. Instead Reitman's opus turned into a rather soft-centred love story, one admittedly with a bitter-sweet ending, but a marshmallow type of love story all the same. OK, so George Clooney's gift of the gab with which professionally he had sugared the pill of being 'let go' for thousands of loyal employees was employed to calm down his sister's intended when the poor chap got last-minute nerves more or less at the altar. Perhaps there was some significance in that. But if so, it is rather slight significance. In the event gorgeous George, who until then had eschewed domesticity with a vengeance and instead dedicated himself to gaining air miles while criss-crossing the US sacking people meets a fellow traveller, beds her and is smitten. She, a good turn by Vera Farmiga, it seems is something of a minx: despite giving George every impression of reciprocating his growing love, in fact is married with children and only regarded him as a bit on the side. Was that the centre of the film? Tables are turned on man? Well, if so, that also wouldn't make sense because despite his aversion to settling down and despite the cruel nature of his job, George's character is rather a nice chap and, in the film, at least does nothing which deserves cruel retribution. Then there's the gal he falls for: if anything she is the nasty one, and a good case could be made that she lead George on. But whatever, the whole story – for that is the story, and forget about any putative satire of corporate America – is simply far too slight for a film of this kind. Clooney, I have to say as always, give excellent value for money as do his two female leads, Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. But despite that I felt cheated. If I want to see a love story, I'll seek one out and see it. And I'll make sure it has more substance than this. I would, however, have preferred a spike satire. But there was, as it became apparent, no chance of that here. Shame really, there was a lot of material to go on.",6,0,1,28 March 2011
V for Vendetta," Banal, pretentious and extraordinarily silly.
","What an extraordinarily silly film V For Vendetta turns out to be. It is almost breathtaking in its banality. And the odd things is that for the first 10/15 minutes you feel you are in for something quite enjoyable. To begin with it is intriguing: who is this guy in the Guy Fawkes mask, what will happen to Natalie Portman, just how did to Old Blighty end up as a fascist dictatorship, what is the mystery of the Larkhill Centre? And most important, how did V acquire his almost superhuman powers, what are his resources (for example, towards the end of the film apparently issuing, at the very least, most of the population of London with a Guy Fawkes mask, a hat and a black cape like his own. Couldn't have been much of a queue at the post office when he went.) But we get no answers at all, at least none which will satisfy anyone with even half a brain. And when I say it just gets sillier and sillier, I don't in any way mean that the silliness can, as it often is in films, enjoyably silly. V For Vendetta takes itself far too seriously for that. We get a load of half-baked, juvenile cod political philosophy, an entirely obscure storyline about the persecution of both male and female homosexuals (and where did that come from. It is shoehorned into the film so maladroitly that it's as though a new film is starting) some silliness about Guy Fawkes falling in love with Natalie Portman and a couple of coppers who aren't quite as bad as the rest of those in authority. There are obvious points to be made - would the whole police investigation of this 'terrorist' really consist of a chief inspector and his sidekick (not, alas, a lovable but rather stupid cockney)? How does this idiot in the mask get around London undetected - he sticks out like a sore thumb. And just how did Britain accept a fascist dictatorship. But even asking those questions means taking V For Vendetta even a little but seriously and - well, it really doesn't deserve it. It is, to use an old-fashioned British phrase, complete b*ll*ks which goes downhill all the way. The Wachowski brothers (with Larry now apparently - according to IMDb - now shacked up with a 'professional dominatrix' who 'keeps him as her slave': put that in your pipe and smoke it) were responsible for the Matrix franchise. I haven't seen any of them, but if V For Vendetta is anything to go by, I shan't be bothering this side of my death. It is lazy, pretentious, superficial and a waste of anyone's time. I did think of being a little bit charitable and allowing that as it was apparently co-produced by DC Comics, it might score if you saw it as a filmed comic. But that won't wash. V For Vendetta takes itself far too seriously to be allowed any charitable leeway.",3,13,26,20 June 2009
