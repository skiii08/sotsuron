Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Come on TPM lovers, tell everyone how you feel!
","First off, considering that according to IMDB's graph, about 3/4 of the voters gave SW I a 7 or better, why are there not more positive reviews in the comments?  If you liked the movie, people, please share your thoughts!Now that I'm done ranting, on to the subject at hand, Phantom Menace, which I saw for the second time today.  This is a worthy addition to the SW saga and only gets better with repeat viewings.  The lightsaber duel at the end absolutely rules!  I watched the original SW (aka Episode IV: A New Hope) on video the other night and was surprised how disjointed the duel between Kenobi and Vader felt.  TPM's duel blows it out of the water.  Just goes to show how far the effects have come in 22 years.Best points: 1. The effects, of course.  Every cent of the $115 million Lucas spent is up there on screen. 2. Most of the leads turn in good performances.  Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon is excellent.  Natalie Portman gives a competent, albeit unspectacular performance.  Episode II should be a chance for her to really shine. 3. The story.  It looks tedious on the surface - political machinations about a trade embargo - but if you look deeper there are some more sinister things going on.  (Hence the title)My main complaints are: 1. Many of the supporting cast seem a bit flat.  Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine and Ray Park as Darth Maul are notable exceptions to this, but Captain Panaka is probably one of the most unmemorable characters in the series. 2. The space battle at the end.  It's not nearly as well staged as either of the Death Star battles, and nothing really of interest happens until Anakin shows up.  Then again, maybe that was Lucas' intention. 3. People who complain about Jar Jar.  :)  He's not really that bad, and he has some moments which are genuinely funny.My rating - 8 out of 10.  Not as good as Empire, about the same as the original (oops, Episode IV).",8,0,0,31 May 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Franchise is out of steam
","Eh.  I've seen A:R twice, and really wasn't able to get into it much either time.One of the biggest weaknesses in my opinion is that I never had much sympathy for the group of 'protagonists'.  Unlike the crew of the Nostromo in A1 who were basically a bunch of innocents considered 'expendable' by the greedy Company; unlike the confident Marines in A2 who find themselves in over their heads and looking to Ripley for help; unlike the inmates in A3 who've found God and, for all their flaws and foul language, see a spiritual side to the battle...this new group is basically a bunch of scumbag mercenaries.  Charles Dutton's character in A3 frankly admitted his crimes, but at least he had scruples.  This group seemingly has none.  They're just unpleasant.Another problem is a lack of suspense.  Maybe it's the effect of three movies, but the 'in-between' sequences - when the aliens are off-screen - seem too empty to build much suspense.  I watched 'Aliens' on cable the other day, and even having seen it probably more than any other film in the series, I still got a feeling of dread when they showed the exoskeleton-looking stuff when the Marines were looking for the colonists. With A:R, I simply got *impatient* waiting for the alien to jump out from somewhere.  And what is with that funky-looking hybrid alien at the end? It looked like Odo (from Star Trek: Deep Space 9) after getting splashed with acid.  It didn't look menacing...just ugly.Good points:  Sigourney Weaver is excellent as usual, and she saves A:R from being a complete waste.  The scene where she finds the failed clones is chilling.But overall, the series ended for me at Alien 3.  Though I'll still probably see A5 if it is made.",4,0,0,14 July 1999
Event Horizon," Depressing ending kills this film.
","A moderately suspenseful 'Alien' knockoff, 'Event Horizon' is done in by excessive ickiness and a real downer of an ending.  Only for the cynical.",4,2,3,1 June 1999
Tarzan," Disney's newest masterpiece
","Ok, before I start, a quick disclaimer:  This is the first 'Tarzan' movie I've seen all the way through.  Nor have I read the books, so I can't speak for the film's faithfulness to classic Tarzan.With that out of the way, Disney's Tarzan is brilliant on its own merits. The animation, music and sound are some of their best ever -- make sure to see this on the big screen if at all possible!  The story is totally engrossing -- I only looked at my watch once through the whole film -- and the aftermath of the final battle is touching and surprising.Since this is a Disney film, the animals talk...BUT, this time there's a new spin on it.  We only hear the animals speak 'English' when no humans are around (Tarzan excepted).  So, when Tarzan has his inevitable meeting with Jane, he doesn't speak a word of English.  The implication, then, is that the 'English' the gorillas speak, is really gorilla-ese translated into English.  This is much like a 'Star Trek' episode where, to save subtitle work, the Klingons speak English on one of their ships, where in actuality they'd be speaking their native tongue.  A very clever twist on a tried and true Disney cliche.In the final analysis, I truly have no complaints about Disney's Tarzan. A perfect 10.",10,1,1,14 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the original trilogy
","Among all the Star Wars films to date, you can't beat ESB for suspense and chills.  Impeccably written & shot.  Also, this film's lightsaber duel improves tremendously on the original's - go back & watch A New Hope, you'll be surprised at how awkward the Kenobi/Vader duel seems.  This film's duel is the first multi-level one, and the effects flow better.  Bring back Kershner to direct Episode II!!N.B.  The adding of cityscapes at Cloud City in some scenes of the Special Edition is a very nice touch.",10,0,0,31 May 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Chemistry between Ford and Connery puts this film on top
","'Last Crusade' is hands-down my favorite of the Indiana Jones films.  What makes this one tick isn't the action, but the relationship between Indiana and his dad, which has a healthy mixture of humor and seriousness.  You couldn't ask for a better Jones Sr. than Sean 'James Bond' Connery. 
The faith angle of the film will please Christians, especially in this day and age where so many films treat religion with disdain.  Regarding the nitpicking below on the story of the Knights Templar, so what?  Who expects this to be an accurate portrayal anyway?  That's what you call dramatic license.  Same goes for complaints about 'unrealistic' action sequences...if they were completely realistic it wouldn't be an Indiana Jones movie.Finally, memo to the person who was frustrated by the 'tight' camera angles in the Young Indy train chase sequence...get the widescreen version that's out now, I suspect that will help.",9,0,0,14 November 1999
