The Longest Yard," Garbage
","You know, you need 10 lines before they let you publish a review. Are there ten lines to describe garbage? I was overly generous by giving this a 2/10. All the time I wondered, 'Were the writers stoned when they 'wrote' this?' This movie is stupid and a rotten re-make of the original - -- unless you're in second grade. The original is so much better. Don't waste your time with the Adam Sandler version. Acting is second grade. Writing is second grade. And it is so predictable....yawn. You'll have a better time watching grass grow than watching this piece of trash. Better yet, watch the original Longest Yard with Bert Reynolds and Eddie Albert. The acting, directing, editing, filming, camera work, music, originality, story line, and absolutely everything else was better in the original Longest Yard than the remake. Other than that...",4,1,2,21 May 2011
Friday Night Lights," Football, Texas style
","Some folks in Texas take their high school football seriously - very seriously - almost to the point where it becomes a religion. If you thought Indiana was a tough place to play basketball, 'sir, you ain't seen nothing' yet.' You better be ready to let it all hang out if you intend to play football in Texas. This is a film about high school football, Texas-style. It's big, mean, and hits harder than a Mack truck spiked with nitrous, in a manner folks at ESPN would have been proud to have produced. It's seen from the viewpoint of what it was like, during one season in 1988, to play football the way it was not meant to be played. A game taken to new heights, and new lows, for a town absolutely in love with nothing' else but football. Vince Lombardi said, 'winning is an everyday thing', but in this town, it's the only thing that matters. Come hell or high water, on Friday nights, either you win or you better start packin'. Kids here are expected to be men. Colleges from around the universe are all here to watch high school football and everyone knows it's the only way out of town. Kids' dreams are made and broken for a Division 1 football scholarship and then on to the NFL. The college scouts know it, the town knows it, the parents know it, and the kids dream it. But in life, just like football, they play the game and sometimes things work out and sometimes they take unexpected paths, and sometimes they don't work out. You never know, which is why they play the game. And they play it in Texas on Friday nights, under the lights.",10,0,1,18 October 2004
Darkest Hour," Lacking & Disappointing
","One, Churchill had no lisp in his speech. I found that lisp highly distracting. And Churchill's voice was much deeper. This actor had far too high pitched voice for my tastes. I also wish they crew had studied Churchill's speeches a bit more carefully. Other than that I found my mind wondering and thinking about other things - something I would not do if I found it engrossing.",6,0,2,10 April 2018
Memento," A Hitchcock wannabe
",Strange movie with some twists - ala Hitchcock.  But it was a bit  wierd. Story would go forwards and backwards.  The 'mementos' were just not that realistic to be believed.  It seemed the guy lost his short term memory for most things but not where he put his little memos.  He always managed to find those - even the new ones.  An amazing feat for someone with zero short term memory.  And throughout the film he would constantly make notes and read the notes - but he never seemed to be bothered with the thousands of tatoos he had.  He belonged in a lunatic asylum.  I never would have guessed a film about some chowderhead writing and reading sticky notes would've been so popular.  Should've been called the sticky note boy. 6/10,6,2,3,5 December 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fantastic Voyage!
","A true classic!  The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle.  He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead.  He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself.  The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez.  With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after.  Well, not exactly like that but almost.  This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film.  Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie.",10,1,3,28 February 2004
The Killing Fields," Dated
","When I first saw this movie I loved it. Now, 32 years later, it looks dated and I wonder why I liked it so much in the first place? This is Hollywood getting holier than thou again. And surprise, the enemy is the Khmer Rouge who are initially welcomed by the Cambodians. It turns out to be a, be careful what you wish for because you just may get it.On the one hand Hollywood rarely, if ever, criticizes Communism. On the other hand, the film blames Nixon for the entire thing whereas the US involvement in Indochina was cranked up due to the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Later the Communist Viet Cong / NVA soldiers would flee into Cambodia as a means of escaping US attacks. But that's Hollywood - judge, jury, and executioner.The main issue I have though is the acting. It seems a bit forced and substandard the second time around. I'm not saying acting is better today, I am saying this was not top-shelf stuff.",6,0,2,7 October 2017
Dunkirk," Not a Masterpiece but Okay
","Wow, all the hype about this movie. And as history buff (mostly WW1) I couldn't wait for Dunkirk. However, I kept waiting for the epic bit that makes the film memorable or classic. It never came. Not only was Dunkirk not an epic, it wasn't entirely historical either.Missing were the French army defending the city which enabled the other some 330,000 to evacuate. Missing were epic radio speeches from Churchill. This, in my opinion, would have sent chills down the spines of audiences. Churchill was a masterful speaker with a command of the English language never before or since seen. And missing were the fleets of boats - yes there were maybe 50-75 boats of all sorts, but if you're going to use an airplane CGI scene, it's not a stretch to use CGI to show the armada of boats going back and forth, the ports of England to the beaches of Dunkirk. Other goofs I noticed were a scene where it seemed obvious that this was the filmmakers water line of demarcation. In other words, you can see lots of boats to the right of the camera but zero boats to the camera's left. Very obvious though I'm not looking for miscues, I just want to be entertained in the way the Longest Day entertained. When the tiny ships did arrive there should have been hundreds of soldiers wading into the waters towards the little boats...nothing in the film but a single soldier going where - to swim to England?Also missing and very noticeable were soldiers firing their rifles at the Luftwaffe. All those armed soldiers on the beach and nobody firing a single shot at attacking Luftwaffe dive bombers (in the film)? Doesn't seem believable that an armed soldier would just stand and watch an enemy fighter come down on him and his comrades.Dunkirk was a lot more than queues waiting to be rescued. The French army (mostly French and some British) fought ferociously to keep the Germans away from the beaches. The city was mostly reduced to ruins. In the end, some 330,000 soldiers were evacuated, of which roughly 35- 40% were French. Most of the French went back to fight the Battle of France while some 3000 stayed in England to become the Free French Forces. That was lost on the filmmakers. This was the opportunity to make the next Longest Day film. It missed badly though it is still an okay film - very watchable. But never in the course of human events on film has so much been lost by so few - in Hollywood.",7,3,6,19 August 2017
