Skyfall," Don't call it a bond film if its not a bond film!
","1 star - why 1 star? because of unusual current rating on IMDb. So to balance it off I've to give a 1 star. The original movie rating reflecting on IMDb should not be more than 5 stars.I happen to watch this movie pretty late, there was a time when I used to watch every bond movie only in theaters, but not since Daniel Craig. I watched this on a DVD and wasted my 2 and half hours.The movie hardly offers anything worth watching, neither the story, nor direction has anything to offer. It could have been just another spy movie that would have gone unnoticed unless you call it a bond movie. Too much attention to M, and bond couldn't even save her at the end. Villain's reason for revenge is just unconvincing, there is no suspense besides M's life in the climax. Too less characters and there is no threat to the world either. The story just sucks!It ain't a bond movie. As said by many others the steady characters like Q and money-penny are not convincing. Q is a proper misfit for the role. There are no gadgets to talk of, just a gun and radio transmitter and a dialog like 'were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't do that anymore.'. There is no style to bond, he is not a charming playboy anymore, he couldn't even save his love-interest.Long story short: They tried hard to keep the bond alive, but they didn't knew he is already dead.",1,5,11,14 May 2013
