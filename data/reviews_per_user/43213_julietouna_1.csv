First Man," A Great Inspiring Film
","I don't know what the real event was like, because I wasn't even born then, but I guess it must have been really a big deal. The movie really has done a good job on showing how inventive people can be in times of need, and on recreating the emotions that the crew, their families and the people in the flight command center had to go through.If you ask me, the film really was at its best as soon as we are in space. Before that the movie was a little bit too slow to my taste and it didn't have that much to say. However, I was sitting on the edge of my seat. It all felt very real and you just have to empathize .all actors did a great job showing us the astronauts, their families and the flight crew on this mission. Their performances made 'First Man' one of the better movies of 2018 I reward it with an 8/10",8,0,1,1 November 2018
