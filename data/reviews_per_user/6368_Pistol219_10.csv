Deepwater Horizon," To those calling it Hollywood trash.
","This movie yes is much of bangs and booms. And people reviewing negative and claiming its trash. I would like to see them work on a rig in middle of the gulf isolated from fast rescue. This movie portrays what the ones on the rig and outside the rig went through and watched happen. So to those claiming it didn't happen that way. Please explain that to those who did not make it off of the rig.
Marky Mark and Kurt Russel do an incredible job.",10,1,1,5 November 2019
A Star Is Born," Multiple Movies in one
","Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Sam Elliot and Andrew Dice Clay.. How could you go wrong. Well you cant, this movie has multiple ways to impact ones soul and spirit. And for musicians like me and music lovers. This film will impact in so many ways on so many levels. Amazing",10,0,0,12 March 2020
Suicide Squad," Fell Flat
","Huge disappointment.. Should have been for of a Joker Harley story Line. But since Will Smith is in it, I'm sure everyone wanted him to have spot light. Leto is the man and So is Smith, roll with that.",5,0,0,9 December 2019
Armageddon," Still a Classic
","Ok this is to whoever bashed and said this should be taken off face of the earth. This movie is still as awesome as when I saw it opening night. So many are saying it's unrealistic and blah blah. Ok well its and Action Michael bay movie and He clearly does stuff right. Its a great movie. And again, MOVIE not reality series which is more fake then this movie. But decided to watch this after watching Deep Impact on Netflix. Man what a difference and talk about un-realistic. Anyways Armeggedon-ing it on.",10,3,3,14 April 2020
A Quiet Place," Why did I wait so long
","Movie is perfect. I wish I didn't wait so long but now that the new one os coming out It was time. Well filmed, you at times forget they have to be quiet and noises are much louder. But ya, great flick",10,0,0,28 February 2020
Logan," A perfect End to A perfect Hero!!
",I hardly ever do reviews. However I have always been Wolverines #1 fan and The moment Hugh Jackman became Wolverine in X-Men 1 It was an instant love affair and Nobody I mean NO Body could do better.Now on to LOGAN. Best I can say is that This was done a perfect as an Ending 'Nail in the coffin' could be. A great send off to what we all knew was Inevitable. I will say I would Love to see Laura ( Wolverines) Daughter. Do more X-Men films to Carry on the Legacy,10,1,1,17 January 2020
Shine," Gets better throughout the years
","I was 11 when this came out and when I first saw it. I grew up in a house of music and I remember seeing it when it came out and understood nearly the same as I do now in my 30's. Was a masterpiece then and just gets better with age. Understanding then and understanding still now how delicate life is and for those of us whit heart and passion. Must always maintain it or we are lost. I feel thats how I related to David and How inspiring , tragic yet wonderful his life was at this time.",10,0,0,30 January 2020
Sicario," Action packed yet slow enough to keep you imvolved
",When I saw trailer before in theaters I was super stoked . When I finally saw the film i was mot let down and was actually one of those rare films that was better then in trailer. I wish I could say Josh Brolan or Banicio carry the film but Miss Emily Blunt fights very well in the ring. Just incredible film.,10,2,3,6 November 2019
Sausage Party," 4th attempt watching
","This movie should have just been a 15 minute short film and maybe Then would be funny. I like Seth Rogan and most of his movies. But he tries to hard to be that 'Stoner' comedian. We get it bruh, you smoke weed. So do I but also acting as if its not a drug is stupid and irresponsible. And then you make tbis movie that legit makes no sense. Even if its not suppose to make sense like some movies, it still should have a point to be watched. Stop making half ass movies while you're stoned.",1,0,1,25 May 2020
Joker," Not at all deserving of the hype
","It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie. This was more of if Joker was though of outside of the DC world. I think since movie imagination and creativity has bern lost through cgi , we take a movie such as this and make a huge deal of it. So ehhh it was good but Stop with the hype.",6,8,15,16 February 2020
