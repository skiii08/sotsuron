Your Name.," One of the Best from the Heart of Tokyo
","This is one of the best animes to come out of Japan.It is such a beautiful anime with scenes that are actually based on real-life Tokyo. Not only that, but it has a really interesting storyline that is quite spiritual and makes you think about the difference between a body and soul (or a person's personality that is beyond the physical). It is all tied-in with the lives of two people who live far from one another, but have a destiny to meet.I love it when the media of anime is combined with mature themes that can be enjoyed by the whole family.Definitely recommended for anime fans. I think I will buy this for my movie collection as it can be enjoyed on so many levels.",9,0,0,25 October 2018
Incredibles 2," Fun Parody of Superhero Movies
","This is a fun parody of superhero movies (especially from Marvel/X-men), but with a modern theme about switching family roles (mother as worker and father on house duty), despite the retro styling.Loved the new group of characters of outcast superheros as they could really be creative and have fun in this area.Overall, not Pixar's best, but we have come to expect nothing but 'excellence' when it comes to their standards. Worth watching, but not one to linger long in the memory afterwards.",7,4,6,25 October 2018
