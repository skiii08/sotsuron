Minority Report," Gorgeous, lightweight, predicable
","Minority Report is the platinum blond of sf movies - it looks great but is ditzy at heart (no offense to blonds, I'm just looking for a cheap metaphor here). As with all Spielberg movies, it looks terrific. But, as with many of his movies, the story is formulaic. It dumbs down Dick's ideas to a by-the-numbers thriller. Admit it, after Max Von Sydow first appears (or you read the cast list), didn't you immediately guess the end of the movie? After seeing the movie several times, the impact of the visuals gradually diminish - they're no Blade Runner - while the storyline falls limper than ever. For someone who is a genre director at heart, Spielberg really drops the ball here. Maybe if he'd limit himself to a first timer's budget (say $5 mil or so), his creative juices would start flowing again.",6,0,0,16 March 2005
Constantine," Better than expected
","From the trailer I knew it wouldn't be the comic-book Constantine, but Keanu Reeves' prosaic and typically deadpan performance grounds a movie that would otherwise be pure sfx schlock. It was also a treat to find a few more subtleties and nuances in the script than might be anticipated. Lots of nice supporting performances, too. I was especially fond of Peter Stomare.It was also nice to see that new (?) director Francis Lawrence jumped the learning curve and avoided the typical shortcomings of directors recruited from the music video arena. The movie's flow is quite good, the build-up to the movie's climax satisfactory and there are a few nice surprises saved for the end. Thankfully there's not the big revelation that many movies have recently become fond of.If you haven't read the comic, and are a fan of metaphysical good vs. evil conflicts (with big budget sfx that look great BTW), you'll find a lot to like in this movie.",7,3,20,17 February 2005
Crash," Nashville for the 00s
","The comparison to Robert Altman is deliberate, and fans of Altman will find a lot to like here. Los Angeles is the canvas and we get to see it in cross-section: by race, class, gender, ethnicity, income. There is a lot of coincidence at work here to weave these diverse strands together, but in surprising ways. As they intertwine, we learn a lot about each individual strand: those we dislike at first are humanized, those we give easy sympathy to are frequently shown in a harsher light.The acting is uniformly excellent. Surprises include a loud-mouthed Ludicrous (Chris Bridges, Matt Dillon who has never been this good before, and Michael Pena in an understated role as a father trying to reassure his child. The always excellent Don Cheadle gives the movie its center, though he get no more screen time than the other main characters.There is humor here, too, the hard-edged, sometimes mean-spirited jokes you tell when you're not being PC. But that's honest. With that honesty, CRASH feels like the first genuine conversation about the American landscape in decades. I laughed, I cried, I left the theater feeling the possibility of renewal.",7,4,16,5 May 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Waste of time
","Even if there were no Terminator or T2, T3 would be a horridly mediocre movie. The original Terminator was an exercise in imagination conquering budget limitations, while T2 showed what could be accomplished if imagination were wedded to an unlimited budget. T3 shows what a tremendous budget with little imagination gets you - a terminator whose unique ability is to make her fingers into sharp points. Whoopee! There are narrative lapses too numerous to mention, such as our non-tech hero operating an atom smasher. Or a heroine who doesn't know exactly what her father does for a living traipsing into the super secret underground & armored military installation where he works. T3 operates best as a self-administered IQ test: if you thought this movie was good, you should seriously consider remedial education.",1,121,215,14 March 2005
Inside Man," Intelligent thrills
","A pleasure from start to finish. An older Denzel Washington has begun to emerge, and his performance here suggests he has many good years left. Clive Owen is terrific as the mastermind. He, and the plot, keeps you guessing. And while there are plenty of clues, they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.One major quibble: Jodie Foster's character is more archetype than person so it's to her credit that she pulls it off as well as it does. However, don't let that deter you from enjoying one of the best movies of the year. I'm glad to see Spike Lee tackle another genre film. He brings a re-invigorating approach to what, in other hands, would be a tiresome rehash. That liveliness seems to have worked on him, too -- this is his best film in several years.",8,167,221,22 March 2006
Sin City," Brutal, ultra-violent, GREAT!
","Rodriguez throws you into the pages of the SIN CITY novels and the movie is much the better for it. Not only does the look mirror the novel, but much of the writing seems to have been retained. While some lines are awkward when spoken, it adds to the abstract, stylized reality that is created on the screen. And once you've adapted to the style of the movie, it's easy to let the stories work their magic. Are these future noir? 21st century horrors? It doesn't matter what it's called. The ride is new and captivating.Who's had anything good to say about Mickey Rourke's acting in decades? They will now, since he turns in the most stellar job in what is generally an exemplary ensemble. (I say generally, since some of the younger actors seem to miss the feel of the material, like contemporary singers trying to perform 50s torch songs.) Even under a nose and chin of make-up, Rourke gives a disturbing humanity to an unlovable man. Or is he? Bruce Willis seems to turn in his best work in ensembles (PULP FICTION, 12 MONKEYS come to mind immediately) and his work in SIN CITY is no exception. And Clive Owen proves yet again that he can animate whatever material he's given. I don't want to slight the film's women, but it is the men who dominate SIN CITY. And it is the story of the three protagonists and their love for women that is the story of SIN CITY.",9,1,4,31 March 2005
