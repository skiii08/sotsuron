Vertigo," I just don't get it
","This opinion might get me kicked out of any film criticism class, but I absolutely loathed 'Vertigo'. It is manipulative, dreary, and completely unlikeable. The first hour or so is spent with Jimmy Stewart on some wild goose chase following a friend's wife to see if she's possessed by a demon(?!?). For some inexplicable reason, he falls in love with her. Once we reach what we're first to believe is the climax, we learn he's been duped somewhat. As have we. The last 45 minutes certainly move more fluidly, but Jimmy Stewart's character becomes so obsessive and controlling, he ought to have been served a restraining order. If I seem a little vague in my analysis, there are two reasons for it: 1. Revealing any plot points might be considered a spoiler, which I'd never do even for a movie I hate, and 2. the movie itself was vague. There is never a logical explanation given for anything that occurs.I have now seen 27 Hitchcock films, and without a doubt, this would rank as #27(just behind two other overrated films, Psycho and Lifeboat), although, in all fairness, I don't count Torn Curtain or Marnie since I fell asleep in the middle of both. So, if you want to belive hype over quality, then by all means, rent Vertigo today, and watch one of our greatest actors wallow in a storm of hopelessness. My advice is to see Rear Window, Hitchcock and Stewart's *real* masterpiece.",2,35,63,18 August 1999
Rear Window," Simply the best
","Pretentious film scholars may say Citizen Kane, hopeless romantics point to Casablanca and Gone With the Wind, IMDB voters love the Godfather, and Brittany Spears fans choose Titanic, but for my money this Hitchcock movie is the all time best American movie. It was the first movie by the master I ever saw, and 26 films later, it's still my favorite. Anybody who only knows Hitchcock for Psycho or the Birds, or Stewart for overbloated Capra fare, should definitely check it out.The basic story is one of voyeurism, and the first half hour has no real plot. But you'll find yourself engrossed in the lives of the people the wheelchair bound Stewart is peering at. This being a Hitchcock film, of course, there has to be a murder, too, and that's when the real fun begins. To reveal anything else would be criminal. The performances all around are astounding, particularly Thelma Ritter as Stewart's nurse. Grace Kelly is mesmerizing as always. But this is Stewart's movie. I am confounded by those who claim Vertigo to be his better performance. He was so disturbed and unlikeable in that film. This is *the* masterpiece of his, Hitchcock's, and all of film history.",10,2,5,18 August 1999
