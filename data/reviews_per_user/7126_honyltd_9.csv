The Equalizer," How many times can you say 'WOW'
","My memory of 'The Equalizer', was a late 80's television series of an older British actor named Edward Woodward, who specialized in helping people with seemingly unsolvable problems.The late Richard Jordan, taken too early, round out the cast. It was a favored show.This 'EQUALIZER', with Denzel Washington, is no retread, but a completely different take on a man who if you were the opposition, would never want to challenge.Many times it has been said this is like the good guy version of 'Training Day'. The only legitimate comparison is that gifted director Antoine Fuqua, was the director of each, and already had his main star's persona in his head, so 100% of Denzel's skills were on view.This movie is not formulaic. Perhaps some of you never met the Russian Mafia from the comfort of your 9-5 jobs, but they are every bit the savage, seemingly unconcerned with consequences personalities, that would affect any human, not a sociopath without conscience or sense of morality.Fuqua uses diametric opposites in order to sharpen this INTENSE, as accurate a word as I can muster, for this movie, which makes no compromises.You have Denzel Washington's character, never fully explained, but clearly a former special forces commando. I go with NSA over Delta Force or Seals, as he shows a calculating non-remorse for the job he has taken on, avenging the beating of a Russian Prostitute who was left for dead, and to whom he had a common late night eatery as a bonding point.Like Clark Kent, by day , McCall is an everyday 'Home Mart' employee, well-liked for his hard work and concern for his fellow employees. But, like Bruce Wayne, when the former commando emerges, he takes no prisoners, leaves no walking wounded. Still, unlike any other action movie, his deeds all seem credible and believable.In the end his fellow workers see the real Robert McCall, at the edge of your seat conclusion , the last 15 minutes of what turns out in the end, to be an epic movie in scope. He literally goes to the head of the snake after an unforgettable duel in the Home Mart, which might as well be the main street in any Western.Always true to his sense of JUSTICE, good is good, bad is trash to be taken out, we are treated to a new genre sub-category, the super action film, an ordinary man, capable of extraordinary acts.10 of ten for a can't miss winner, I guarantee you will like.",Null,0,5,11 October 2014
The Butterfly Effect," Engaging movie that was full of suspense and held interest throughout.
","I just finished watching this movie which I saw on DVD because I missed it when it was at the theater ( such is life when you have a newborn ).I found it thrilling and suspenseful, whether or not it accurately reflects examples of the 'Chaos Theory' or 'Butterfly Effect'.Any good movie engages the viewer and allows for the willing suspension of disbelief for it to be effective and though slow at it's start for the purpose of setting the stage, it takes off and the pace doesn't slow until the end credits.I thought Ashton Kutcher did a serviceable enough job in a lead role and I always like the under-used Melora Walters who I thought was great in every movie she has been in since 'Magnolia' ( Evan's mother ).So, throw away the textbooks and the theories and get wrapped into the suspense of multiple time lines and their parallel outcomes.Personally, I don't believe Time Travel will ever take place because the proof of it would already be evident in a world, though even if seamlessly changed, still remains remarkably the same.The original 'Time Machine' with Rod Taylor' ( not the horrible remake with Jeremy Irons ) still stands as the best time travel movie of the lot, though this entry is far more complex and intricate than George Pal's masterpiece.Watch it and have some fun!",Null,0,1,31 July 2004
Batman Begins," Thrilling action adventure movie
","Evaluating this movie within the context of the action/adventure genre leaves no question as to it's merits or excellence.From the supremely talented collective cast, including my favorite actor Christian Bale, whose turn in Equilibrium and American Psycho left no doubt he would set the standard for all Batman movies, to the thrill a minute last hour, it contained everything summer fare should be...it is a blockbuster that delivers and is every bit the contemporary to the 'Raider's of The Lost Ark', an iconic action movie.I really think that the dissection of this movie by cinema buffs is overly analytical as it's faithfulness to the action drama and superb acting are the parameters which matter, not how tight the fight sequences were shot or the casting Of Katie Holmes, which parenthetically was not as bad as this board led me to believe.My all-time standard for miscasting is Sofia Coppola in 'Godfather III' who brought the film to a halt every time she was on the screen; sure Holmes is young, but she was appealing.All in all, this is a solid 10 star movie that leaves you anticipating the sequels.",Null,0,1,26 June 2005
Unknown," Incomprehensible
","Maybe I am missing something here, as clearly my impression of this film is far different than its current rating would suggest. It is ludicrous, at times incoherent, and only second in the personal hall of infamy for incredulous nonsense to the all-time worst in that category, '2012'.In 2012 you had a protagonist who could escape mere building collapses by flying through them, with the help of his wife's new husband who had no real previous flight experience. He could outrun crevices which in real-life move just under sonic speed on land, by driving on the neighbor's lawn.In 'Unknown', a film by an unknown writer and director, with big name leads, you have a supposed master spy who starts this whole mess of a movie by forgetting his super secret assassin spy briefcase. Is it irony or absurdity when a great actor in Frank Langella deadpans to Liam Neeson, 'you were my best agent'. I guess that doubt would enter anyone's mind if they left top secret plans in a briefcase you wouldn't forget, if you were a super spy assassin, in the cart at the airport.It only gets worse from there.When is the next Jason Bourne movie? That is fiction which plays out as realistic. 'Unknown' is pure wait for cable tripe.",Null,3,7,23 February 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," It seems EVERYBODY is missing the point
","Perhaps it is in the perspective of looking back in time on this thriller, that has the advantage of fresher perspectives and recent history to more accurately see what Kubrick was stating.It is funny to see cinema aficionados develop theories of metaphors and allegory, so convoluted and complex. They are the people with Eyes Wide Shut. The TRUTH of this cinema masterpiece, is hidden in plain sight! Woven intricately throughout this film are the themes and representations of a group said to influence almost all of Hollywood. They are said to be sexual predators, using woman like sex slaves, the imagery of the movie. Today we have the benefit of Harvey Weinstein and scores of other people outed from the 'ME TOO' Movement, with impropriety woven through every level in Hollywood.The imagery in Eyes Wide Shut is that of the rumored 'ILLUMINATI'. It isn't coincidence that the Orgy at the Mansion, is filled with Pentagrams, devil masks, rebuking Christian ideals with Pentagram stars on the Christmas tree. The Illuminati are as real as the yearly Event in Bohemian Grove, filled with politicians, rock and rappers, Hollywood movers and shakers, caught on camera worshipping an Owl totem and Baal, a Devil figure.The scene of that Orgy with all the nudity, is a representation of the Illuminati orgies, from costume to the Rothschild inspired mansion.More interesting in retrospect is Kubrick's heart attack, which allowed Warner Brothers to edit 24 minutes out of the film, as Kubrick had a contract of full artistic control. It is said to have contained the lurid scenes of human sacrifice, and developed the character dancing with Nicole Kidman as the man in the red robe at the Orgy. Rainbows, pedophilia, and magic are throughout the movie, more Illuminati themes.In the final scene, at the toy store, the board game of magic with a Pentagram, and the fact that the daughter seems to go off unnoticed with two older men looking back at Cruise and Kidman, harkens to the black magic and pedophilia, said to be part of Illuminati practices. In plain sight in the movie are the mask of a pyramid and the all-seeing eye of Horace.If you think none of this can be possible, Look at the back of your dollar bill where you will find the all-seeing eye, the Pyramid, and under both the Latin phrase which translates into NEW WORLD ORDER.....hidden in plain sight.",Null,4,9,27 August 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Oh, the ironies
","Zero Dark Thirty, an ambiguous title, never explained, is a metaphor for the movie itself.Beyond the sheer heroism of the Seal team responsible for the ultimate assault, a product of superior men, hand-picked for a team which is called upon for only the most dangerous pursuits, everything else is as ambiguous as the title.Never before has celluloid been as TWO dimensional as this movie was depicted. We learn nothing of the main characters, a full two-thirds of the movie setting up the eventual assault through the exploits of a heroine who speaks like Rambo, but looks like a 'Bond' girl.It is incredulous to believe that she was recruited out of high school. Is this where the modern CIA finds their best applicants. Did she excel in showing a propensity for killing, or as a dogged pursuer who was a human 'bloodhound'? Don't worry, it is never explained.The ultimate capture seems more a product of dumb luck, than any organized plan. In fact, there are moments we are reminded that the actual hunt promised by Bush, was long forgotten, if it weren't for the actions of one woman who would not stop looking. It was almost as if she was autistic, an idiot savant with one skill, never giving up, but not for any reason that is explained. Jauvert in Les Miserables at least gave his reasons for his single-minded pursuit.If anything, this movie is one of ironies. No one doubts the malevolence of a man who would plot to kill so many Americans, and did. Then again, this movie never went into the rich fodder of moral ambiguity in the manner that that the Bush Administration ginned up false evidence to turn a terrorist act, a nation-less act, into a war that also killed thousands of innocents in Iraq.You learned nothing about Bin Laden, his motives, his rationale. You never saw the President, just the liaisons between the CIA, pictured as almost the Keystone cops, hardly inspiring.The movie was a cardboard cutout, the scenes depicted in chronological order like a security tape with the running time at the bottom. It had no pacing, skipped all over the world and picked mere dates in time, when things happened, no more than a cinematic scrapbook called, 'How I killed Bin-Laden'.What is lost so ironically in this movie, is the morality that made 'Lincoln' sear the pain of moral ambiguity into anguish. Here, there are just 'drone-like' CIA personnel, doing a job, never stopping to see the conflicts between the Geneva Convention, the War Crimes we punished after WWII, and their bullying tactics, ordained by men like Dick Cheyney, as heartless as the movie was.Cheyney, Bush, Rumsfeld and the Neocons turned a national tragedy into a war for plunder while our Nation was mourning and confused. Movies like the 'Green Zone' with Matt Damon have shown how false the intel was to support a war against a Country that administration wanted to wage so badly, only needing a 'Pearl Harbor-like excuse' to exploit, and kill innocent civilians, and countless brave American soldiers for false WMD.The real bad guy was killed off here. What did we learn? The CIA hires, and then 'retires' it's no longer needed operatives. I'd say, just ask Hussein and Bin Laden, both on the CIA payroll, but they were retired by 'The Company', permanently. Oh, the ironies....Five stars as a great Mock documentary. No passion, no feelings, except a numb feeling leaving the theater.",Null,48,96,6 January 2013
Inception," Redefining reality one layer at a time
","Where to begin to discuss a movie where only superlatives apply? Acting, brilliant, especially the principals, DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, and incredible supporting turns by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Ken Watanabe.At once, idiosyncratic, sweeping, thrilling, and as layered as a master's chess match, Christopher Nolan has excelled in his sheer brilliance at redefining cinema, and the unfolding of a story as nuanced as the perfect acting within it. In a way, this is fitting, for this is a movie within a movie, realities within realities. There may be a handful of detractors, but this movie deserves the praise, the rating it already reflects on IMDb, and the acclaim it is receiving. In a way, it has the feel of 'Memento', to the extent that time is a conceit within the movie. However, despite glorious cinematography, global locations, and state of the art effects, this movie never insults its audience, and doesn't rely on any resolution that isn't firmly a part of the established parameters of the story.I don't believe in waxing poetic over a movie, unless it is a deserving classic, presents some thought provoking commentary, or is something that has never been seen before. The latter is so rare in cinema, that such a movie usually comes to define a generation, or mark a moment in film history. This is that movie. This is the 'Star Wars' of this new era in film-making. Once upon a time George Lucas reinvented the science fiction genre, and made cinema history in the process. Christopher Nolan has matched this newly imagined movie making, and in doing so, has set the bar extremely high for anyone looking to combine action, drama, thriller, mystery, love story, espionage and re-imagined reality. After walking out of this movie, you may question what is, or isn't, real. Are you awake, or dreaming? Christopher Nolan may cause you to question just what you think you know.A ten if ever there was one! A must see!!",Null,1,4,16 July 2010
Casino Royale," Best Bond Since Connery
","Ian Fleming's James Bond will always be owned by Sean Connery. Though Dr.No is dated as far as effects and style, the passage of 44 years has not diminished the polish and cool charm under fire exuded effortlessly by Connery.Throughout his successive turns in the role, James Bond was Sean Connery and no latter day Bond, in the minds of traditionalists, could ever be quite as convincing.In his later movies, Connery added a veneer of snappy one-liners and sardonic sarcasm. In Dr. No, we saw the 'raw' James Bond, chillingly cold and true to Fleming's vision.Surprisingly, Daniel Craig has managed to pull off a major coup; he has simultaneously reinvented the Bond franchise, much as Christian Bale has brought back the previous moribund 'Batman'. Despite the obvious physical differences, these are almost quickly dispersed as you get lost in the character, who is a credible incarnation of the pre-Dr.No Bond, rough around the edges, yet to fully define his character and ultimate evolution to top notch spy and cold killer with a license to kill.If time were fluid, it would be easy to see the Craig character turn effortlessly into the Connery character in Dr. No. For that, Craig and the screenplay and the director should be commended on doing the best thing possible under the circumstances...give you a 'new' James Bond, who is as close to the perfection of Sean Connery as can be obtained.",Null,2,4,1 December 2006
RED," A Comedy Action Love Story Willis Special
","From the moment Bruce Willis became the perfect action hero in 'Die Hard', he has been an audience favorite when overcoming insurmountable odds, while barely getting bruised for his efforts. In this turn, Bruce isn't a cop, but a retired CIA agent, who some unknown force is looking to liquidate. As in past films, swarms of bad supposed good guys come after him. As always, by stealth or by force, Willis outguns or is no match for whomever is sent to get him.First, it is a CIA 'hit squad'. Then, the always good Karl Urban ( 'Chronicles of Riddick', 'The Bourne Supremacy' ) is put on the case, and the cat and mouse game unfolds as Willis seeks to learn why he has been targeted for assassination.Unlike the Bourne movies, always deadly serious, this movie actually successfully combines comedy with action, to create an amusing travelogue set like chapters to a book, by the use of postcards with the location of the next scenario. What sets this movie apart is an eclectic mixture of actors you would never expect to see in a Willis action movie. Joining Willis in his quest are no less than Morgan Freeman, John Malkovitch, Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox, other retired agents and Cox as the ex-KGB agent. The former nemesis is now a friend, and those who should be friends, his ex-CIA employers, are now the bad guys.Malkovitch is the scene stealer every time he is on the screen, and his LSD induced mania, described tongue in cheek by Willis, is the result of a past CIA experiment in which Malkovitch was dosed for eleven years. The paranoid ex-agent is usually right when he senses danger, but is still remarkably efficient and proficient, even in his crazed state.Mary Louise Parker is the innocent caught up in the whirlwind of Willis' hunt for clues, and becomes the hunted along with him. She joins the zany bunch of elder agents by circumstance at first, then by choice. Willis, a bored retiree has a long distance crush for the government pension girl, who doesn't realize his former line of work, and who is forced into the fray because as Willis says, 'they know I like you'.Mayhem, explosions, full scale attacks by huge forces are still no match for the indestructible hero, though there is a sacrifice made, and some blood shed, by some of the Willis cohorts.This isn't rocket science, but a great date movie, a good time, and most important, worth the investment in a ticket. The last time I could say that was 'Inception'. Look for the cameos of Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss. An 8 out of 10, for perfect execution of a Willis reprisal and revival. Go see, and have fun too.",Null,9,13,18 October 2010
