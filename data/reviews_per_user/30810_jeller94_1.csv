The Avengers," Best Superhero Movie of All Time
","I, along with thousands of others, grew up a huge superhero fan. Film makers capitalized on the superhero fandom by making franchises off of the most popular heroes such as Superman, Batman, and Spider-man. I remember as a kid loving those movies, but I would think, 'Man, how cool would it be if they made a Justice League or an Avengers movie!'. But it was just a dream. Until 2012. After Iron Man started the MCU in 2008, superhero fans and movie fans everywhere witnessed a legendary event, when The Avengers graced the big screen. And boy was it good!Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger introduced us to all the main characters in this movie, so there was no need for dumb intros *cough*cough*... Suicide Squad... What's great is that each of our heroes are at different places in their journeys and it shows in their roles in this film. The casts does an amazing job of playing a group of very different heroes coming together, not because they fit well together, but because they have to, in order to save the world. The plot may be simple, but it works. The film is fun, action-packed, and evenly paced. Loki is my favorite MCU villain to date... I know I know ... Thanos ... he's great and all, but there's something about Tom Hiddleston's Loki that is so likable without downplaying him as a threat.Infinity War may be remembered as the greatest Avengers movie, but this movie will always be my favorite.",10,3,4,23 July 2018
