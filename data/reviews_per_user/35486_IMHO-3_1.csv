The Blair Witch Project," Awesome flick.... Go see it if you have an imagination
","An exceptional movie! Do not go see this film if your definition of a good horror film is Scream or I know what you did last summer... you will be sorely disappointed. There is no real blood and gore, no sexy teenager with big bouncing boobs, and no special effects. Don't expect to jump out of your seat, it's not that kind of scary. The movie footage is jerky and bouncy at times but that is part of the magic. If you have a good imagination and aren't as dumb as a rock you will really enjoy this movie. It scared the bejesus out of me. Now for some tips for viewing this movie: 1. Don't sit in the front row. The film can be a little nauseating due to the motion of the cameras. 2. Go to a matinee to see it, less idiots. 3. Pay close attention during the first of the movie... Especially to the interviews with the locals so that you can clue in on the legend. This is essential to totally 'get' the ending. 4. The first 20 minutes or so are a little slow but pay attention. It picks up speed and the end is great!Go see this movie if you want to be scared in a totally different way.",10,1,2,7 August 1999
