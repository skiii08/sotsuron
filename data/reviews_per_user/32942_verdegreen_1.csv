Scarface," A new take on a classic style
","I rated this movie a 9 due to the lack of decimals, in reality I would say it was somewhere around 8.7 so I rounded up. The reason I rated this movie higher than its average is because it represented a very original take on a fairly unoriginal topic. There are countless movies about gangland violence even some widely regarded classics including the Godfather trilogy. While the others focused on a climactic point in a larger story like the rise or fall of an individual or group, Scarface takes a much broader view and shows an almost unbiased picture of his life. None of the others even come close to rivaling the amount of emotion put into this film because we follow Tony over a much larger portion of his life allowing us as an audience to see why he makes certain decisions. In other situations the audience is simply told 'this is the way the character is' with some character reinforcement, but Scarface brings it to a whole new level allowing the characters to show you how they are instead of the director or narrator. All in all this movie deserves to be at the top of its genre and is easily in the same league as the Godfather movies because it is simply a different look at a similar situation. Scarface is one of the few movies I would regard as a must see for any real film buff.",9,0,2,3 January 2014
