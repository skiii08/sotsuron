Mission: Impossible III," Best Mission Impossible Film Yet
","This was the Best Mission Impossible film to date. It was better than 1 and 2 put together. I saw the film yesterday as part of a preview crowd crowd here in new york city.::::THE BAD:::: Ill start with the bad. the reason it didn't get a 10 out of 10. This movie wasn't complex. That is something that i like of these SPY Movies. Imagine a James Bond Movie where you know as much as the agents do, thats what i got from this movie. It had Some Practical moments to be blunt. The storyline was a bit similar to other mission impossible films, except just a different geographical location. :::THE GOOD::: THIS MOVIE FREAKING ROCKS! If you are into action. a little romance. a hot Asian woman and a little bit of racism to thicken the mood. then you must see this movie. This movie has better gadgets, BIG stunts, Makes me want to become a SUPERSPY. Yes it's that type of movie... well let me stop before i hype it up so much that ill spoil it.. BUT SERIOUSLY I Guarantee you'll like it... remember 9 out of 10. OH BY THE WAY. I WISH that the nemesis (Philip Seymour Hoffman) had a longer part in this movie.. HE WAS THAT GOOD.",9,8,16,28 April 2006
