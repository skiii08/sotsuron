The Ring," holes in the ring
","I loved this money, Thought it was the most visually intense movie I have seen in years other than Requiem. Whats the deal with all the holes though. I would have liked to have more explanation about Samara's powers. I thought it was a bit of a cop out that the viewer was told little about what made her into what she became. Also, if samara was causing all that trouble while dead in the well, then what does it mean when the little boy asks his mom, 'you didnt let her out did you?' She was causing just as much havic inside, so whats the difference? It was holes like these in the ring that dissappointed me a bit. Please help me out with this if i am totally off base.",9,0,0,24 October 2002
