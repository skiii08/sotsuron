Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Superb Film, Definitely worth a Worth at the Cinemas
","The biggest challenge any sequel has in Hollywood is, to surpass the expectations of its predecessor. The original Sherlock film was brilliant, the action, the suspense of the plot, the almost brother-like closeness of the Holmes and Watson and the vernacular employed, left me thinking it was one the few films where I actually got my moneys worth.So knowing the challenges the new film faced, i went to see it on the big screen with some trepidation...After watching the film, i felt that this film, has managed to better its older brother and not by any short distance. the humour was familiar yet better, the twist bore the fingerprint of a Ritchie movie, Professor Moriarty lived up to his reputation and role as Sherlocks' primary Nemisis, and the evolution of the friendship between Holmes and Watson now he has left Baker street was dealt brilliantly.So to sum up, if you want to see a film which will have you laughing on a too frequent basis, riveted all the way through and want you craving for more... this is the film for you. A brilliant performance from all lead performers and the crew",10,1,4,24 December 2011
Inception," Mind Blowing But Yet So Understandable
","I just watched this in the cinema.. its all about how one (Leo-D) can manipulate someone's dreams in order to control them (to an extent) or extract information.The Plot is sooo complex with differing levels of understanding. But somehow Nolan has managed to make it understandable to anyone who wants to pay attention, not to hard to understand at all.One thing to note.. I heard on a BBC review that the hotel corridor segment is apparently real and not a CGI stage to make a dream state believable to us the viewerLeo-D has picked a Phenomenal script to act to.. and he fulfils his role in the movie brilliantly.. the supporting cast are not exactly famous but they bring a sense of believability to each of their own characters.Personally it beats the likes of Shawshank, Matrix and Usual Suspect in my Top 10 Movies of ALL time.This film is definitely worth a trip to the cinema.. I'm going to go again.. but the DVD; its a Definite.. Enjoy everyone... I did!",10,2,5,18 July 2010
