The Blair Witch Project," Interesting but forgettable
","Knowing what to expect before I even entered the theater, I was not surprised or scared by the events.  As a horror film it rated pretty low on the fear factors although it did generate some interesting uneasy moments because of the technique used.  The climax was well done and it did generate tension but the constantly shifting camera left me and my family pretty nauseated by about mid-film.  And I didn't even have any popcorn.  The good part of the film is that it broke a lot of rules that have governed cinematography for years.  The bad part is that it will more than likely become some sort of film cult classic without really deserving it.  I guess the part that bugged me the most was that I thought EVERYONE knew that if you are lost in the woods, follow the creek down stream until you hit some sort of civilization.  I am a city boy and I know that!  Those three characters deserved everything they got.",1,0,2,24 August 1999
Crash," Good story but hindered by 'style'
","I really wanted this movie to be better than it was. It had all the right elements  great dialog, clever situation, some good to really wonderful acting, good story line  but the sadness is that the director want a 'style' and that 'style' did not work. Like 'Miami Vice' very few recall the stories but all recall the pastels and unshaven faces, 'Crash' tried to capture the seedy part of Los Angeles, not by filming the grit but used technology to make everything gritty looking.It's a good film. Following the same story type as 'Go' or 'Magnolia' it is a fascinating story of interwoven lives and how we all touch each other eventually. It uses the same basic theme that all conflict is a statement of prejudice and it is a roller coaster of emotions, some honest, come contrived. The cast is simply wonderful. Each character is believable. The funny parts are very funny and the sad parts are very sad. If you liked 'Go' or 'Magnolia' you will like this film every bit as much.",6,8,19,29 April 2005
American Pie," Ho Humm, another teen movie...
","Except for a few moments during the film and the great comedic theft by Alyson Hannigan 'and one time, at band campÂ…' this movie is a waste of time. It's been done so many times by so many actors that these kids come off as cheap imitations of the kids who did this movie before them.  Almost all of the jokes fall flat and lack the true emotion that makes comedy funny.  I have to admit that the last 20 minutes was pretty funny, especially the scene with Alyson ('what's my name, B**ch!') and the scene with 'Stifler's Mom' on the pool table but the rest of the movie was predictable and lame. It was NOT worth the hoopla and not remotely worth of comparison to 'Something About Mary.'  Go rent 'Risky Business' or 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' to get some REAL teen movie laughs.",3,2,4,20 March 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Setting a higher standard for 'war' movies
","Every once in a while a movie comes along and sets a new standard for the class.  In this case 'Saving Private Ryan' has achieved that place in two areas: the 'war' movie and the 'human condition' movie.  On one hand 'Ryan' does not mask, shield, or taint combat in any manner from the viewer and lets the experience of war happen in all of its stark reality.  I have a feeling that any movie depicting war will use 'Ryan' as a model from now on. The strongest message that the movie sends is that in war there is no motivating sound track and people do die horribly, without mercy, and often without reason.  Drowning in eight feet of water within reach of the beach, applying a bomb that goes off prematurely and having no effect on the target, being shot by an unseen sniper, are all displayed without glory or the indication of some greater purpose being achieved in the end.  What is left are those alive and those that are dead and those that are alive must live with the horror of what they have been though.But, the really great 'war' movies are not really about war, but are really about how people react to an extreme condition that they are faced with.  In this case 'Ryan' moves from one gender to another without the viewer realizing it.  Much has been said and written about the battle scenes in the movie and far too little has been said about the emotion between the squad of soldiers and how they feel about trying to rescue someone they have never met.  In the countless movies I have seen about the same basic topic this one tells the untainted truth about this emotion.  The soldiers do it because they are ordered to but like every American soldier, marine, sailor, or airman that I know, they don't like it and they will let everyone know about it.  But beyond that the film also shows the American combat soldier as they really are: crass, vulgar, dirty beyond belief, prone to raw humor. But where this film excels is the depiction of why they are how they are: long days of stress, fatigue, danger at every moment, living moment by moment.  By the time the troops leave the beach and the horror there, the viewer accepts their condition and forgives their behavior and manner.  Even the word 'forgives' is bad word to use.  The film generates the emotion in the view that these troops have 'earned' the right to behave in any manner that they please.  They have paid for that right 1,000 times.But the humanity prevails in many ways, some large and some small: the raw emotion when one of their squad falls in combat, the sharing of gum from one mouth to another, the group resentment of those who have not been through the hell that they have been though, the appreciation of a piece of music that will relieve them of thinking of their situation for only a moment.  It is these moments in the film that elevates the movie beyond a regular war film into a classic that other films will be measured against.  I have seen 'Ryan' four times now and it has not failed to generate a strong emotion in me every time.  There are no heroics in this film.  There is only an accurate display of humans, placed in a situation that is beyond belief, who do things because they have to, not because they want to, and to they best they can without reward or commendation.  Their only reward is survival.",10,0,0,22 September 1999
