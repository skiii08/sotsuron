Insidious: Chapter 2," Insidious is back with a malevolent vengeance
","Insidious: Chapter 2 may be somewhat uneven, but at a certain point near the end, I realized I hadn't taken any notes during the second half. For all its weirdness, the film had utterly transported me.",9,1,1,5 March 2019
Changeling," Angelina's performance was powerful and at times agonizing.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates 4 a worthy adventure.
",Does pretty much what it sets out to do -- play up and on those things that have worked in the previous films. It's a lot like one of the later Crosby-Hope 'Road' Pictures.,8,2,2,8 May 2019

Hereditary," You can believe the hype, Hereditary is absolutely nuts

Minority Report," The movie's combination of old and new influences energizes its believable futuristic elements.

Erin Brockovich," It's a fun movie with a heart, and definitely worth the big screen treatment.
","Steven Soderbergh, after over a decade of experimenting in various forms of independent film (sex, lies and videotape; The Underneath; Schizopolis; The Limey), has begun to dabble in the mainstream; his current marriage, to a major studio film with an A-list star, could have been enough to send him scurrying back to the art house.The result here is not stillborn but a frisky, friendly child full of surprises. Erin Brockovich, Soderbergh's comedy-drama starring Julia Roberts, is in outline a lot like several other films, particularly A Civil Action, as well as the sort of true-life empowerment story you see on Lifetime every six months or so. But this film moves with a light step, and it takes time not just to establish characters but to appreciate them. You're in the hands of a director who genuinely likes people. In tone, the movie is actually closer to gentle mid-period Jonathan Demme films (like Melvin and Howard or Citizens Band) than to a routine legal drama.If Erin Brockovich didn't actually exist (she does, and has a cameo in the movie as a waitress named Julia), some screenwriter would've had to invent her for Julia Roberts. As written by Susannah Grant (Ever After and 28 Days), Erin is brassy, determined, full of love for her three kids and wary of everyone else; the character is perfectly suited to Roberts' strengths, and she plays Erin as a frazzled, ordinary woman with a knack for cutting to the point. No cutie-pie, Erin is a sharp, angular person -- an irresistible force that doesn't believe in immovable objects.After managing to find work at a California law firm, Erin starts to discover odd things in routine real-estate files: medical records that don't seem to belong there. She soon learns that a local plant, Pacific Gas & Electric, has been contaminating the water with chromium and has been trying to buy off the locals. With the initially grudging help of her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), Erin digs deeper and tries to rally the townspeople in a lawsuit against the corporation.In a way, Erin Brockovich is the distaff companion to Wonder Boys -- a disorganized wreck finds meaning in an endeavor larger than him/herself. The filmmakers here, as in Wonder Boys, pay more attention to subtleties of character than to plot mechanics. The actors are given space to bloom. Aaron Eckhart, so reptilian in his other roles (In the Company of Men, etc.), turns in a relaxed, friendly performance as George, the scruffy biker who gets involved with Erin and looks after her kids because he genuinely likes them. Albert Finney, too, seems energized in his many scenes with Roberts. They make a great team, providing two laughs for the price of one: Erin says something outlandish, and then Ed stands there silently, unsure whether to scream or laugh, or both. Watching Albert Finney struggling to keep his composure is one of the quieter pleasures of the movie season.Don't mistake Erin Brockovich for a classic or a masterpiece. Like Soderbergh's previous mainstream film Out of Sight, it's simply an example of Hollywood entertainment done with finesse and compassion, the way it always should be but so often isn't. Perhaps such a movie triumphs more because of what it doesn't do than because of what it does (Erin Brockovich, for instance, contains not a single tedious courtroom scene).The movie isn't really even about the lawsuit or about going after a corporation. It's about a woman finding out what she was meant to do, and finding the community that needs her.",9,1,1,14 January 2019
Unbreakable," Remarkable, dark, and surprising.
","Again, the director uses Bruce Willis as his leading man; again, he draws from the action-star icon an intense, low-key performance that is all about stillness and silent pain.",8,1,2,20 February 2019
As Good as It Gets," The greatest pleasures come from the acting.
","Both funny and sad, the 1997 Best Picture Oscar nominee, As Good As It Gets, followed in the footsteps of James L. Brooks' previous film, 'Terms of Endearment,' except it was more eccentric, nutty, and in moments genuinely moving.Brooks, a better writer than director, essentially makes TV soap opera on the big screen, benefiting from big budget and the presence of movie stars.The central three characters are all flawed individuals, in desperate need for connection, if not love.Jack Nicholson won his third (and second Best Actor) Oscar, and Helen Hunt won her first Best Actress Oscar as the romantic couple: He, a rich neurotic, who frequents the same restaurant every day; she, a working class single mom.Never mind the age difference-Nicholson was 60, and Hunt only 34-there was chemistry between the misogynist bachelor and the needy but proud and defiant mother.The movie opened to mixed reviews, but scored big at the box-office, with grosses of close to $150 million in the U.S..Some critics carped that the movie was too long and indulgent, claiming that writers Mark Andrus and Brooks constructed a good beginning and a good ending, but a weak middle.The tale's sentimental nature (a problem with all of Brooks' features) was here effectively countered by Nicholson's wickedly funny conduct; including cruel mistreatment of a dog.Others saw 'As Good As It Gets as an extension of Brooks' TV work; all of his films contain scenes that betray his sitcom origins.The segments devoted to a gay painter (Greg Kinnear), forced to go to his disapproving parents to ask for money, slowed down the picture and resorted to gay stereotyping. But it offered an opportunity for the mostly indoor tale to get outdoors, with a trip in which each of the three characters has some terrific moments of self-discovery.Brooks saw his film as a humanist tale with a message: 'That which makes us safe, also imprisons us.' And indeed, in the course of the story, all three figures are forced out of their comfort zone to confront new challenges associated with new, unfamiliar encounters.",10,1,1,12 January 2019
Darkest Hour," A weighty and eloquent historical drama film about a visionary leader.

Captain Marvel," It's a fun movie with some great Nick Fury moments.
","As an action movie, Captain Marvel is really clever, with more than a few twists that'll surprise both comics fans and newcomers...the biggest problem then, is that Captain Marvel is doing so much, we don't actually get to know her all that well.",6,3,6,10 September 2019
Shakespeare in Love," A triumph of talent and style over silliness.

Brokeback Mountain," Arguably Ang Lee's best film, this swooning, achingly sad near-masterpiece offers a universal love story that lingers long in the mind
",In 1963 Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) show up penniless at a Wyoming ranch to look for work. The strangers are quickly assigned to herd sheep together on Brokeback Mountain. Be it the pristine setting in which they live sleep and work together or the appearance that they're practically the last two people left on earth something draws them together and before long they share a tent and a raw liaison. In order to keep their jobs they know they must keep this secret affair just that and must decide on a larger scale whether or not to embrace their emerging love. Over the next 20 years the two men-almost as if by familial rite of passage-marry and become fathers but find themselves drawn back together. But can they ever find the happiness they shared together on Brokeback Mountain in the real world? Be prepared for at the very least an Oscar nomination for Ledger who painstakingly embodies the plights that his character would actually face. The plights for a gay cowboy stuck in the most unforgiving of cultural and societal climates are many and well could there have been a tougher character to portray this year save for Johnny Cash and Truman Capote? Which is certainly not to take anything away from Gyllenhaal's work here (or in Jarhead)-Jack is more willing to submit to the love reducing his character's complexity but not the actor's dramatic fireworks which are nothing short of captivating. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway co-star as the cowboys' wives possibly deserving of Oscar nods of their own had their roles been bigger. For director Ang Lee Brokeback signals a dazzling return to his roots. Don't let Lee's Hulk aberration fool you for this is a daring director who helmed The Ice Storm and Oscar-winner Sense and Sensibility. Brokeback finds Lee dissecting the humanity and the lack thereof in a relationship that goes beyond mere gender. But more importantly he explores the threshold of the alpha male as an incorrigible creature. The film is also stunning almost hypnotizing visually with much of the story unfolding against the lush nature of Wyoming. And the score by Gustavo Santaolalla befits the ambiance perfectly without ever being intrusive. All in all the film could've stood to trim a few minutes but it just might be Lee's best to date. (Plus expect a major boon for the fashion industry as hipsters might again be sportin' skin-tight cowboy duds-and boots-in '06!),9,2,3,13 January 2019
Aquaman," Hollywood has given us the greatest, goofiest holiday gift in a long time.

Yes Man," Yes Man is a terrific feelgood comedy, with Jim Carrey in brilliant form.

The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's most timely film.

Cast Away," one-man show
","As melancholy as it is affirming, 'Cast Away' tells a darkly comic, occasionally punishing parable about what happens when humans lose sight of humility in life's grand scheme - an interesting thematic twin to Tom Hanks' own 'Joe vs. the Volcano.'",9,0,0,5 April 2019
Cast Away," An awesome movie.
","A man stranded on a desert island has served as the premise for classic literature like Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson, and has even figured into the recent fad of wildly popular and intellectually barren TV shows like Survivor. In Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, it's two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks learning to crack coconuts and spear fish; he'll doubtless acquire another nomination for this intense work. Hanks has been stranded in outer space, behind enemy lines, and even in an evil toy store owner's office, but this performance, done with no other actors present during the majority of screen time, tops all the others, reaching the emotional level he acquired in his first Oscar-winning role, Philadelphia. If only his supporting cast measured up.
Cast Away, written by William Broyles Jr. (Apollo 13), is presented in three acts. The first section, which takes place in 1995, introduces us to Chuck Noland (Hanks), a Federal Express executive from Memphis whose job is to instill in his trainees his own slavish reverence for being on time. 'Never commit the sin of turning your back on time,' he preaches. Although he loves his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) very dearly, he must leave her at Christmas for a business trip halfway around the world. As they quickly exchange gifts, she gives him a family heirloom pocket watch with a picture of herself inside the cover. 'I'll be right back,' he says, kissing her goodbye. Hours later, his cargo plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, washes up on the shore of a tiny, uninhabited island with no provisions or supplies except the clothes on his back, his tiny picture of Kelly (in the stopped watch), and the contents of a few FedEx packages he manages to rescue.
The middle portion of the film, following Chuck's adventures from his first day to his rescue four years later, is the longest and most engaging part. With virtually no dialogue except for the occasional comment to himself or to a volleyball he names 'Wilson,' Hanks pulls off an amazingly real performance. Acting is much more difficult without a script to suggest emotions or the direction of events; Hanks and Zemeckis say with pictures what could not be said with a thousand words.
The final section involves Chuck's return home after having been thought dead by everyone he knows. Kelly, now married with a daughter, has understandably conflicted feelings about Chuck, having already gone through the grieving process and moved on.
It is wise of Zemeckis, who led Hanks to his second Oscar in Forrest Gump, to devote such a large portion of the film to Chuck's solitary exploits in his hellish paradise, because the scenes which feature other actors are noticeably less effective. Hanks and Hunt don't connect well enough before his absence to make their strained relationship afterward appear in stark contrast as it should. It is effective on the part of Broyles's script that the film is presented completely from Chuck's point of view rather than switching back and forth between him and Kelly, so we don't see her for the entire time he's on the island, either. Apparently, filming was halted for a year in order for Hanks to lose 50 pounds and grow his hair and beard; Zemeckis used this time to film What Lies Beneath. The change in Hanks's appearance is surprising, though some will recognize a similar look during one portion of Gump. Don Burgess's cinematography, supplying dazzling views of Chuck's tropical prison, highlight the irony of his situation, and Alan Silvestri's distinctive muscial score, although used sparingly, also underscores the sweeping beauty of the surroundings.
If all of Cast Away were as gripping as its long midsection, it would be overwhelming; still, even with its flaws, it marks another milestone performance for Tom Hanks as well as for Robert Zemeckis.",9,1,2,12 January 2019
Armageddon," Armageddon peels your eyelids back and blows your eardrums out until rational analysis is moot.
","It's schlock, sure, but it's fun schlock with good performances and good special effects and a reasonably brisk script. It pushes all the right buttons in two formulas -- action-comedy and adventure.",6,2,3,5 April 2019
The Village," The Village is a truly special film, one that is largely misunderstood by the masses.

Cold Mountain," A film of many excellences undermined by a flawed narrative.
",Kidman's locks gets mysteriously re-highlighted during the Civil War's most depressed period - maybe Zellweger's Ruby was as handy with foils as pitchforks.,10,2,2,4 January 2019
American Beauty," Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his life.
","In fact, 'American Beauty' may not be correctly termed a black comedy at all. Nor is it a domestic drama, although it certainly has elements of both genres. Rather, it's a thrill ride on a par with the most adrenal summer blockbuster. Only here, the explosions are all emotional, as the movie takes film goers on a pinball-like journey from one potent reaction to another.Most of those reactions center on Lester Burnham (Spacey), whom we meet in a 'Sunset Boulevard'-like introduction in which he announces he's 42, lives on an attractive street in a good neighborhood, has a beautiful wife and daughter, and within a year he'll be dead. A preamble suggests the events that will lead to his untimely demise, but very little is what it seems in a world in which projecting the right image is all.After his deadpan introduction, Burnham shows us the days and nights that precede his death. We see his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), a driven real estate agent whose dedication to preserving appearances approaches white-knuckled desperation, and we meet their daughter Jane (Thora Birch), a sullen teen-ager who sulks through the house like a brooding, wounded animal.Lester's family life is a shambles, but the pivotal event in his soon-to-be-ended life is his introduction to Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), Jane's sexually precocious best friend. If that last name rings a bell, it's no accident. Like Delores Haze in 'Lolita,' Angela has a catalytic effect on Lester, who becomes as besotted as a schoolboy. He also begins to make some major changes in his life, which account for the film's most painfully amusing scenes.Lester's transformation sends Carolyn and Jane on their own journeys of self-discovery. In Jane's case, that involves the Burnhams' new next-door neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), the 18-year-old son of an abusive Marine captain played with sinewy toughness by Chris Cooper. Ricky likes Jane -- he thinks she's more interesting than the prosaically blond Angela -- and he's taken to filming her with a digital camera whenever he can.Is Ricky's voyeuristic hobby a dangerous predilection or simple curiosity? Is Lester a pedophile or, as he puts it, 'just an ordinary man with nothing to lose'? 'American Beauty' is suffused with a palpable sense of danger, keeping filmgoers unsettled until the very end as to what exactly motivates these complicated characters. And no punches are pulled when they're at their worst: Ricky's father's violent outbursts are sickening in their suddenness and brutality, and Lester's lust is repulsive even at its most pathetically funny.But the movie never loses sight of the humanity behind even the most reprehensible acts. It's a balancing act pulled off with unusual intelligence by Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball, who have inspired these accomplished actors to give the performances of their lives.Heretofore consigned to supporting roles, albeit critical ones, Spacey commands the screen with a performance of subtlety, vulnerability and supreme confidence, in which he expresses mordant self-mockery and poignance in a single gesture. Evoking Jack Lemmon at his most un-mannered, Spacey brings flawless comic timing to Lester's self-absorbed, infantile and rapacious behavior. (His smirking style is just right for Lester's snarky outbursts.) But he also holds on to the pathos of Lester's rage, turning what looks like just another midlife crisis into a rebirth, in which something long dormant flutters tentatively to life.Spacey might carry 'American Beauty' (on nicely buffed shoulders, it bears adding), but filmgoers shouldn't ignore some equally potent performances: Bening's breakdown in an empty house is a heart-stopping aria of despair, self-loathing and taut control. And all three teen players -- especially the ethereal-looking Bentley, who delivers the movie's central message with touching gentleness -- give sturdy and courageous portrayals in roles that would daunt actors twice their ages.Director of photography Conrad Hall has photographed the Burnhams' world to exploit its surface shine, while Thomas Newman's score underlines its slightly surreal undertones. Production designer Naomi Shohan has done a witty job with the color red, whose almost decadent vibrancy is repeated throughout 'American Beauty,' from Carolyn's prized roses and Angela's mouth to a vintage Pontiac Firebird and a poetically still pool of blood.Masterfully calibrating all of these elements, as well as coaxing out the most human and fully realized performance of Spacey's career, Mendes has created a movie that will endure. Unlike similarly themed films like 'Happiness' and 'Your Friends and Neighbors,' 'American Beauty' doesn't rely on just shock value to wow audiences. The shocks here all transpire on the level of the human heart, where the ability to be astonished will never wear thin, a fact 'American Beauty' proves with uncommon assurance, grace and compassion.",10,0,1,13 January 2019

The Amazing Spider-Man," It's a classic, and the attraction is not the surprise of the plot, but to see how it's done this time. The answer is: very smoothly.
","The Amazing Spider-Man reboot didn't arrive with the kind of media circus that the masked vigilante is accustomed to on the streets of NYC. Instead it quietly spun a solid, intricate plot in a corner left abandoned for the past five-years and waited patiently for the buzz to begin. Once word gets out, Marc Webb's Spidey will be swarmed: this is the spandex-clad saviour no one knew they needed.Sure the quips aren't as quotable as The Avengers, or the action as big-balled and sprawling, but there's a real story there and an emotional trajectory that forces you to care. Happy 50th Birthday, Spider-Man. The Brit who got bit, actor Andrew Garfield, is superb as the skater boi meets science nerd turned webslinger. He starts out as an updated outsider, popping contact lenses until he stumbles upon his father's specs in a briefcase that propels him on a journey to discover the fate of his folks.Square specs on and the high school image is complete, with Gwen Stacy (played by an endearing Emma Stone) making the opening act look straight from the pages of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's own Amazing Spider-Man circa '65. Gwen is Peter Parker's intellectual equal, number one in her class if you ask her, excelling as his squeeze and making Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane appear shallow for falling for the hero first, boy second. 'I've been bitten,' Peter tells a wide-eyed Gwen, 'Me too,' comes the sincere reply.Their first kiss succeeds in rivalling the memorable peanut smuggling, upside down antics of the Sam Raimi original and delivers a very real and passionate clinch (with webbing). You can practically hear the hormones firing and sparking. She's effortlessly likeable, a honey trap for fans that are bound to feel a creeping dread the deeper the character gets into the franchise. It's billed as the 'untold story' and manages to cover new ground whilst putting a fresh spin on the cornerstones of Spidey's origin. The radioactive arachnid lurks in a lab at Oscorp where Peter's search for the parentals winds up.Here we're introduced to Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who's working on a formula that can regrow limbs (including his own absent appendage) and ultimately make everyone equal. It's a noble ambition and one that easily gets out of control, fluidly slipping into danger territory once the experiment goes awry and he becomes a giant city lizard. Ifans plays the tragic antagonist with subtlety, teasing the would-be father figure role before his descent into full-blown, green tinged madness. This scientific development marks a huge breakthrough in villainy that leaves the Lokis of the world looking around wildly for a better excuse. The film is by no means flawless, though.The CGI rendering of the Lizard really is as awful as you suspected it might be. Police Captain George Stacy sums up the incredulity we feel with a curt, 'Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?' You never quite believe the monster is there in the scene rather than in a computer and his booming voice is too over-the-top evil to be taken seriously. Step away from the microphone and snarl or something, Rhys.There's also an unnecessary nod to the comics when he shrugs on the shredded lab coat for the final showdown and engages in fighting talk that teeters uncomfortably on cringe. Even Spidey's wisecracks misfire when he starts pounding on a car thief, kicking off a running commentary that Iron Man should have given him pointers on. Elsewhere, the script is much slicker and succeeds in spinning a yarn that will have you displaying genuine concern for the main players, and even the fate of some bit-part ones. Martin Sheen makes a wonderful Uncle Ben and he's given some great material to work with, whilst Sally Field's calm and confrontation-skirting Aunt May balances the guardian double act.Much like the original venture, The Amazing Spider-Man takes its time developing the characters so that by the time Peter gets in his first sticky situation, you definitely give a damn. Incidentally, the scenes where his spidey senses kick in are some of the best in the film, adding humour that the Tobey Maguire version lacked as he grapples with his newfound super strength; slamming doors never looked so satisfying.This reboot also corrects what irked so many the first time around: those web-shooters. True to the comics, Peter has manufactured his own artificial weapons loaded with super-strong adhesive. The fact they are artificial rather than organic also gives him a weakness, which every good superhero needs. The whole shebang was captured in stereoscopic 3D rather than a shoddy post-conversion and if any superhero was going to suit this medium, it was always going to be Spidey. He shoots from one corner of the screen to a truck to a crane leaving us suspended, 60-storeys up in downtown New York and in awe of the view.The city makes an exhilarating backdrop for his urban ballet and seems much more grimy Gotham than The Daily Bugle's usual technicolour beat. Patriotic parades and daytime adventures are traded for back alley brawls, gunfire and those graffitied arachnids that form part of Spidey's viral marketing campaign, on and off film. Thanks to this stellar retelling, Andrew Garfield's spin will be going global.",10,0,0,13 January 2019

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A wonderful mess of a film - as lovably neurotic and unstable as the webslinger himself.
","The film may be too slick for its own good, overcorrecting the earnestness of Raimi's series, but it never poses as anything other than sensory overload. It's a confectionary creation that's likely to drive kids wild, and plenty of adults, too. As an adult, I've rarely fallen victim to my inner 10 year-old, but 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' consistently broke down the critical barriers that I've honed throughout the years. It's a sugar rush of a film and, quite simply, I liked what it did to my brain. It's often not able to see past its own nose, content to exist forever in the moment, but it's popcorn filmmaking in its purest form, and Marc Webb deserves all the credit in the world for making such a delectable cinematic cake from a line of incongruous ingredients.

Titanic," Jack and Rose actually cause the Titanic to hit the iceberg. Watch closely.
","In retrospect, it's easy to be cynical and stuffy about James Cameron's 1997 Titanic. It surpassed previous champs Star Wars and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial as the top moneymaking film of all time (itself eventually surpassed by Cameron's Avatar), a personal affront to countless moviegoers over a certain age. With its record-tying 14 nominations and record-tying 11 wins, it turned members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences into a bunch of teenage fangirls (it wasn't until six years later, with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, that AMPAS members turned into a bunch of teenage fanboys). It allowed Cameron, a genius as a filmmaker but an SOB as a human being (his ego's at least twice the size of the big boat itself), to become the self-proclaimed 'king of the world.' And it led to a lengthy period when it seemed as if Celine Dion's ubiquitous 'My Heart Will Go On' was the only song ever recorded in American music history.But now it's time to go back to Titanic, which has been re-released to theaters not only in celebration of its 15th anniversary but, more soberly, only a few days removed from the precise 100th anniversary (April 15, 1912) of the disaster that snuffed out 1,500 lives. Cameron spared no expense for this re-launch, spending millions to convert the film into 3-D. Admittedly, most pictures that weren't originally filmed in that process but were only converted later as an excuse to boost ticket prices have failed to provide much extra oomph to the 2-D imagery (e.g. Clash of the Titans, Alice in Wonderland), but if there's one thing to be said about Cameron, the man knows how to derive the most technological bang for his buck. Titanic in 3-D looks fantastic, employing the format in a way that makes viewers feel as if they're the ones rounding a corridor corner or fighting to stay afloat in that icy Atlantic water.Fifteen years later, the highs and the lows still remain; luckily, what's good about the movie continues to easily outweigh its flaws. The fictional storyline is hoary in the extreme, relying on a 'wrong side of the tracks' romance: Shortly after boarding the ship as it prepares to embark on its maiden voyage, poverty-stricken artist Jack Dawson spots socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater and instantly falls for her. In these career-propelling roles, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent, delivering warm, winsome performances that provide their romance with an epic grandeur it certainly wouldn't have attained in less capable hands. The trouble, for both the young lovers and the audience members, is the presence of Rose's fiancé Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), a supercilious millionaire who would just as soon push the lower classes off the face of the earth as give them the time of day. As I watched Cal constantly berate the poor, expose his ignorance in wince-worthy dialogue (criticizing a painting by Picasso, he opines that the artist will never amount to anything), smack Rose around, and try to kill Jack by taking shots at him, I kept wondering why Cameron had elected to leave off a mustache that Zane could twirl at regular intervals - the character is even more cartoonish than actual cartoon character Snidely Whiplash.",10,1,2,13 January 2019

Cloud Atlas," A true gem.
","Let Cloud Atlas pour over you. It's an amazing achievement in visual story-telling, a fascinating and intelligent view of the future and among my favorite films of the year.",9,5,7,20 February 2019
Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas is like nothing I've ever seen before. It's a bold cinematic treasure from a brave collaborative filmmaking collective.
","We're all connected. It's either as a species, as part of a communal society, or as individuals living within universal maxims of love, fear, happiness, and struggle. Over time, over place, we still maintain a link, locked in to our shared humanity, no matter the situations or circumstances. Though it has much more to say about this subject than a few introductory sentences can proffer, this is the main theme of the brilliant and bold cinematic statement from Lana and Andy Wachowski (The Matrix) and collaborator Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run), Cloud Atlas. Unfairly dismissed when it was released, this artistic revelation reminds us that, though years and backdrops may divide us, a commonality of purpose and perseverance endures.Interweaving six stories across eons and realities, we start with an old man (Tom Hanks) telling a story by a fireside. In 1850, a lawyer (Jim Sturgess) sails the Pacific and befriends a slave (David Gyasi) preyed upon by an unethical doctor (Hanks again). Then we move to England in 1931 and a composer (Ben Whishaw) trying to balance his love of a young physicist (James D'Arcy) and the demands of working as the assistant of an aging maestro (Jim Broadbent). In the '70s, a journalist named Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) uses the musician's story as inspiration in her attempt to uncover the truth about a possible problem at a nuclear reactor run by a shady businessman (Hugh Grant). Her friendship with a mystery-loving teen (Brody Nicolas Lee) leads to the story of a publisher (Broadbent) who, after angering a gangster client, ends up in a nursing home against his will.A movie made of his comic story becomes the Bible for a genetically engineering servant girl (Doona Bae) in a future Seoul fast food conglomerate. With the help of an anti-government rebel (Sturgess), she becomes an effective propaganda tool. Her thoughtful and profound words of resistance become the basis for a religion in a far off distant future where the planet has been destroyed by radiation. Living like savages, a father (Hanks) tries to protect his family from cannibals while helping one of the last members of a technologically advanced race (Berry) contact possible help off on another world.Cloud Atlas was the best film of 2012. It was and remains a misunderstood masterpiece that, in time, will be turned into the cinematic classic its ambitions aimed for. Working together, the Wachowskis and Tykwer have taken the complicated novel by David Mitchell and fashioned it into a genre-crossing complication of individual movie archetypes (the period piece, the future shock, the '70s activist, the '80s British comedy of manners) that meld together to form one emotional and entertainment epiphany after the other. The result is a remarkable, complicated experience. On the one hand you marvel at the meticulous moviemaking acumen at play. On the other, you're stunned by how prescient it ends up being.This is an unbridled success, a spectacular expression of the spirit of mankind synthesized into a storyline that ties seemingly divergent elements together in graceful, elegant ways. Music makes Berry's character continue her probe of Grant, while a clone's cobbled-together memories of a bawdy publisher's problems become the foundation for a far off distant faith. Elements in the past play heavily in arenas in the present, while small asides add up to big payoffs in the end. This is what film as an artform is about - the transportation of the audience to somewhere they've never been, to see things they never would normally experience. While it doesn't always work flawlessly, it does consistently amaze, turning the title into a map of everyone's interwoven experiences. It's a true gem.",9,2,3,13 January 2019
