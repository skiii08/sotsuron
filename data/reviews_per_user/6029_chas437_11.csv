Whip It," Original Plot?
","Don't get me wrong, this is a kick ass movie but anyone notice the plot is essentially identical to 'Bend it Like Beckham'? Also, while I love Ellen Page and think she her future is limitless, her character in 'Whip It' is just a bit too similar to her character in 'Juno'. Getting type cast at an early stage in her career is a something she should consider in future roles. That said I think she is probably the most talented actress in her age group and that she will expand into other types of roles with great success. She exudes intelligence, wit and confidence.I really love the modern spin on Roller Derby. I think the revival of the sport began in San Fransisco in the early 2000s and spread to places like Seattle, Austin, etc. I hope we get it in my town soon! The culture of neo-roller derby probably doesn't appeal much to the old-school feminist paradigm, but see it as very empowering to women.",9,1,6,4 November 2010
Ali," Overly Long yet Incomplete
","If one really wants to know the history and legacy of Cassius Clay/Mohamed Ali, there are a number of great documentaries about the man, his life and his fights.This was an ambitious film with good sound editing and cinematography. The issue here was the screenplay. Its not a complete or satisfying telling of the man's life. There is nothing about his early life, his Olympic Gold Medal days. It all begins with the first Liston fight and ends with the Foreman fight, and at the same time, this film runs almost 3 hours.Ali's most famous fight, the 3rd Frazier fight, is completely omitted. Ali almost died after this fight. Ali becoming a mental vegetable in his 50s was considered to his taking way too much punishment during his fighting days. Surely this is an important part of the story?Another thing missing, his horrific treatment of Joe Frazier. He called the man an ape, a monkey and an Uncle Tom.This was a huge waste of resources. It was well regarded when it came out, but this will become a forgotten film. Will Smith was a B- as Ali.",4,1,2,4 July 2019
Lords of Dogtown," Just Mediocre
","In contrast to Peralta's superb 2001 documentary about the rise of skateboarding and the Zephyr team, this is an uninspired effort.
This was an unnecessary project. The cast is mediocre to poor. This is Heath Ledger's worst role. Its also one of Catherine Hardwick's lesser directorial efforts. Its really not their fault. There is very little to work with here. Peralta wrote this poor screenplay, but I get the feeling he was getting pressure from above to make a lot of compromises.
The end result is an aimless narrative that sells hip, cool and attitude. There's really no substance here. Its a shame.",3,1,2,1 June 2019
The Village," 'The Village' Doesn't Fit Neatly in a Box...
","Therefore, all the hatred and horrible reviews ensue. Roger Ebert gave this film 1 star. Unbelievable. He either had a petty gripe with the filmmaker, or this film went right over his head. The former I suspect. If you've read Ebert's reviews over the years, you will see he misses the boat on many great films. This is one.This is a film that defies genre. That apparently is too much to handle for a great many film goers. It also comes with a profound twist. This film is best appreciated if one doesn't know about this on initial viewing. Many people who knew about the twist ahead of time trashed the film. Many others were expecting a gruesome horror film.'The Village' is loaded with profound thematic material. In the character of Noah, we see the origins of evil. Petty human jealousy leads to a 'crime' as Walker puts it. This is what the founders of the Village came to escape.We also see the creation of a mythology in Ivy's journey. Every budding civilization required its own mythology. The story of Ivy and Lucius underscores and edifies the vision of the founders.Its not a perfect film, but I found it to be so fascinating, I re-watch it every year or so. The music is beautiful and the performers are outstanding. Sadly, The Village sails right over so many people's heads.",10,6,6,18 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The Ending is the Definition of Pedantic
","This film is devoid of plot, humor, suspense or any reason to care. Instead its a montage of hip, cool, retro images that are little more than curiosities. Its basically an overly long, borefest.The ending was exasperating. I wasted some time trying to make any sense of it. The Tate/La Bianca murders did happen and in the most brutal fashion. It was a cultural watershed moment, as some have said, it was the death knell of the 1960s. Why postulate that it didn't happen? I finally came to the conclusion that it is merely petty pedantry from the feeble mind of the once adequate Tarantino.",1,2,5,6 April 2020
Pawn Sacrifice," Sanitized History, Plain and Simple
","I suppose this is a nice story and the cast is top notch, but the film bares little resemblance to actual people and events. But what is unforgivable, the film gets Bobby Fischer completely wrong, and in doing so, attempts to sanitize the man's legacy.Tobey McGuire is a talented actor, but this was a terrible casting choice. His mannerisms, speaking style and physical appearance are way, way off. The real Fischer was a tall, dark, brooding, anti-social figure. His ugliness on the inside manifested itself in his outward appearance. Tobey McGuire is simply too likeable to play such a role. He tries really hard, but its just not believable.I'm old enough to remember the World Championship match in Iceland in 1972. It captivated the world and made chess popular in the mainstream. Fischer's victory gave America a much needed morale boost during the depths of the Cold War.So, while it was a triumphant moment for America, it was the beginning of a long, painful descent into madness and infamy for Bobby Fischer. The film portrays Fischer as a somewhat lovable eccentric with a paranoid personality. In reality, Fischer was almost certainly somewhere high on the Autistic spectrum. He had other serious mental disorders as well. None of this was clinically diagnosed, but was evident in his actions over the years. He was a loner who treated people very badly. He died
penniless, friendless, as an international criminal. His was not a life to be celebrated.A much better film on the subject is the 2011 documentary 'Bobby Fischer Against the World'. Even the early-90s film 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' tells us more about the man, and the phenomenon than 'Pawn Sacrifice' does.'Pawn Sacrifice' is really a big waste of time and resources. The producers badly missed the mark here. The one bright spot is Liev Schreiber who is a perfect Boris Spassky. Frankly, they should have just made a film about Spassky with Schreiber in the lead. Schreiber is one of our very best actors.What is most troubling about this film, as well as many films these days, its attempting to revise history in a way that is most palatable to the masses. This film really misses the point of Bobby Fischer's' life.",1,4,9,28 January 2018
Hidden Figures," Oscar Bait at its Worst
","How predictable is Hollywood? A year after the uproar about too many white actors being nominated for Oscars, we get this film. Its a trite narrative, minorities/women overcome racial and/or gender bias to achieve greatness despite the evil white devil man ignoramus. 'Hidden Figures' represents a new low in this genre, because it appears that the material presented is largely fictitious.It takes a 5 minute glance at Wikipedia to find out that the achievements of these 'women of color' were exaggerated, if not invented. Are we really meant to believe this story? These women have the answers while a room full of MIT engineers, mathematicians and rocket scientists are stumped? Its simply not believable. OK, I get that women, and minority women in particular need to feel better about themselves. But self esteem should stem from actual, real life accomplishments. This is material so typical of the ethos of the millennial generation. You should feel good about yourself JUST BECAUSE, no actual merit required.This sort of revisionist history is just a big lie, for the sake of appeasing loud minority groups who seem to want racial quotas for film awards. More proof that political correctness is destroying art.",1,84,162,30 October 2017
"Girl, Interrupted"," Should Have Been So Much Better
","The source material, Susanna Kaysen's memoirs are compelling material, but it was quite poorly adapted. The screenplay becomes bogged down by unnecessary cinematic gimmicks and tacked on scenes which are superfluous to the basic story.As much as Jolie's performance was praised by fans and critics, it was overblown. There is too much of the Lisa character in the film such that it detracted from Susanna's journey. Lisa's continual escapades and escapes are simply not believable. Why would an institution who's mission is to help these troubled young women continually let Lisa prey on the other patients? How does she escape from padded cells over and over again?
Its gutless filmmaking. The final scene, on the night before Susanna's release is completely unneeded. Its reminds one of the tacked on final scenes in action/adventure movies where the supposedly dead monster has one last gasp. Its a cheap gimmick.
Its a shame for Winona Ryder, who had loved the project for years. She was instrumental in seeing this film made. WInona's nuanced performance is bulldozed by an over exposed Jolie. Even Susanna Kaysen was a detractor of the film. This should have been Ryder's Oscar, but they screwed it up.",5,1,5,14 May 2019
Pulp Fiction," The Most Overhyped Film of My Lifetime
","This film was wildly popular in the mid-90s, and I'll admit to enjoying it back then. But, 25 years later, it hasn't aged well. Tarantino's slick innovative cinematic style is now seen as gimmicky and trite. The staggered time line thing has been overdone to death.When you get past all the imagery and hip dialogue, there's really nothing there. Its not really storytelling, the screenplay is probably the worst thing about Pulp Fiction. Ironic that Tarantino's screenplay was the only Oscar winner.I give it 5 stars because there were substantial innovations in the film, just not enough to overcome the total lack of substance.",5,3,12,26 May 2019
Marriage Story," Opinions on 'A Marriage Story', Elites versus the Rest of Us
","There is a growing divide in our society between the cultural elitists and normal people. Its the difference between those whos world revolves around life in NYC and LA or Boston and San Francisco and those who live out their lives in ;flyover country'.The wildly varying opinions on this film are perfect example. While then elites see this story as sad, but the 'new norm'. We commoners see a structural problem. We might ask who wrote these perverse laws that allow lawyers to make out like bandits while leaving their clients in debt and acrimonious. We even ask is the ScarJo character even had good reasons to want a divorce from a marriage that seems almost idyllic.People in middle America tend to remain married and consider the best interests of their children and their family, its not always about me me me. People like the ScaJo character think they have something profound to give the world, more often than not, they don't.The delusion of the elites was never more evident than the latest Academy Awards. Its astounding that this film was nominated and even won an award. They are so intellectually and culturally bankrupt that they are scaping the bottom of the barrel. 20 years ago, there would be so many great films that some all-time great films weren't even nominated. Now we get this. Wokeism and delusion rule the day. sad,",1,2,12,13 February 2020
The Deer Hunter," A Vastly Overrated Film That Has Aged Badly
","I saw this film in college in the early-80s. At the time, there was so much hype around 'The Deer Hunter', I felt I almost had to love it. I was greatly disappointed and never gave it a second thought. A film group I'm in viewed this recently, and WOW, it hit me, this isn't just a bad film, its aged horribly. Nonetheless, my contemporizes continue to heap praise on the film.Lets be clear, the film is way too long, tedious and unrealistic. The wedding reception goes on forever, and for no apparent reason. The director was obviously going for some sort of effect here, but he failed, and today's audiences would simply walkout on this.The hunting scenes are farcical. Last time I checked, the Canadian Rockies aren't in Pennsylvania.The war scenes are offensively bad.So, how did this film come to be so highly regarded when, in fact, its a terrible film? I believe its an exercise in mass delusion. So, this was the first big Vietnam War film to hit American theaters in 1978, AND it was meant to show the war in a very negative light. Well, that's all film critics and movie 'aficionados' needed.",1,5,14,13 January 2018
