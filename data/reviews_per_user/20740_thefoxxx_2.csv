Iron Man 3," didn't live up to it's potential
","I remember seeing the first trailer to this movie, and it looked like it was going to be darker and grittier than the first two films. It almost looked as if Christopher Nolan was making this movie. I was excited about how intense and dangerous the Mandarin looked, then I saw the movie. What a total joke. First of all, there's no way Happy would've survived that explosion, and why did the so called 'Mandarin' have to be an actor pretending to be a villain? That was really dumb. I don't blame the actors for this movie being bad, I blame the writers for this one. Way to let us down Marvel. It's as if Marvel Studios got together, sat down and said, 'Okay we made all this money from The Avengers, everyone loves Robert Downey Jr. Let's take all the horrible ideas we've had for previous Ironman films and throw it altogether into one huge suck-fest!' I understand that they wanted to show Tony Stark suffering from PTSD after the New York attack, but the other stuff wasn't needed. Also, I really was hoping for Pepper to die in this movie. Is that mean? I really don't think a stand alone Ironman movie can work anymore.",5,1,2,23 July 2014
Jurassic World," Jurassic World review (spoilers)
","Being a huge fan of Jurassic Park and the novels, I was excited and had high hopes for this movie. Did it exceed my expectations? Yes, it did. Jurassic World is probably the better, if not best sequel to Jurassic Park than The Lost World or Jurassic Park 3 is. Picking up 22 years after the first film, Jurassic World brings John Hammond's dream to life with a fully functioning dinosaur theme park open to the public since 2005. The plot of the film is that a hybrid dinosaur called Indominous Rex is created in order to bring the park ratings back up. The I-rex gets loose and starts killing everything for sport. It is basically the same plot as the first film, but with a new story and characters. I liked that, I liked how original and faithful they stayed to the first film. Yes, there are references to the first film. There is a scene where these two kids end up in the old visitors center from the first movie. And yes, the original T-rex is back. The raptors are back also, but not as an enemy this time. Anyone who hasn't seen this should go see it. Don't go into it thinking that it's going to be better than the first, because it's not. Nothing will top the first movie, but this is an excellent sequel and a great time.",9,15,37,21 June 2015
