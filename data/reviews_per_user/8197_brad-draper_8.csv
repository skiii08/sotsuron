Love and Death," Love and Death: A DVD Movie Review
","Love and Death: A DVD Movie ReviewRelatively obscure, this 1975 Woody Allen written and directed spoof on 'War and Peace', and the Ingmar Bergman genre as well, is outstanding fair. Because this is a film that first appears to be slapstick with quick quotes, funny lines, and hilarious dialog, it is often disregarded, but it is really significant movie art.Not to become too philosophical, but it is also a kind of serious movie, with extreme undertones of satire regarding the ultimate human joke, that is a subjective, or is it objective philosophy towards life, love, and death? It makes ultimate fun of the subject matter of it's entitlement: 'Love and Death.' Woody Allen was quoted once as remarking that this was the favorite of his films, at least of that comic creative period of his during the1970's. I would have to agree with the director, as this tiny little 90 minute gem is my favorite Allen escape into the ultimate question, and the most perfect flight into the darkness of human insecurities, about immortality, as treated with humor.Woody is really on with his stand up shtick in this film . His jokes come a mile a minute, with only a few duds, but mostly his deadpan delivery strikes home with logical humor. An amazing comic in his hey day, Allen was truly one of the funniest men on the planet in the 20th century. And joining him in this film is his perfect straight woman which will always be Diane Keaton.One cannot ignore this amazing actress, and classically beautiful woman, Diane Keaton. The persona she projected during her formative acting career in the 1970's through 1980's was inspired and stunning. She was both a comedienne genius, but also an impressive dramatic female presence, in particular in the 'Godfather' series, and in the so tragic brilliant but flawed film 'Looking for Mr. Goodbar'. Diane possessed a sort of lovely vulnerability, with high cheekbones, steel blue gray eyes, with quick and slight movements, long and tragic fingers, and a delicious overbite that brightened her unique, compelling, sensuous, optimistic, yet always fragile smile.The rest of the cast are chosen for their physical look. In particular the part of French Emperor Napoleon. This is a sort of period piece set in the time of the Napoleonic wars, and it is interesting to see the mock battles between the French and Russians seemingly almost 'Barry Lyndon' accurate when they were not made fun of.The final barometer of this film is that Love and Life are about suffering and that Death is better than spending an evening with an insurance salesman.'Love and Death': A Woody Allen film than many critics rate as mediocre is misunderstood, as this lovely treatise on the satirical side of making fun of philosophy, by the comic master, Woody Allen, is by this critic, highly recommended to any thinking man's DVD collection. I look forward to viewing it again soon.B. A. Draper",9,3,3,23 February 2006
Troy," 'Troy' - The Honest Soul of the Iliad on Film
","Given some cynical reviews based, I think on a lack of knowledge on the subject matter, I had avoided the current 2004 epic movie 'Troy'. But I bought it the other day for only ten dollars in a bargain bin - 2 disc deluxe DVD widescreen edition even. And after viewing the film I can only say it retains the soul of Homer's 'The Iliad', that fantastic bard of Greek poetry that describes the tragedy of the senseless war between Trojans and Greeks, with the tale of Achilles, King Priam, Hector, Helen, and Paris in tow. It is a great sad story and to see it put to film in such a proper way is a real joy of film making from a fan's point of view.But why the professional critic's cynicism? Perhaps because of jealousy that Brad Pitt, as the legendary Greek warrior Achilles, can play a successful portrait with his athleticism, male sensitivity, and ultimate male brutishness that is so effective? Or is it that Peter O'Toole's character as Troy's King Priam is a tour-de-force and that critics have always loathed Peter for some reason - is he too good? Perhaps Hector played by Eric Bana is just a bit too human? That Paris' Orlando Bloom is ultimately a coward turned hero but in being so, in irony, kills in tragedy? That love is what sometimes causes wars? And maybe it is because the heroic women in this film, especially Helen, seen as a tragic painting by Diane Kruger, crushes the fragile male soul with her sad and hopeless ultimate beauty? Perhaps this movie is too close to human tragedy to be criticized by jaded movie critics?In capturing the soul of 'The Iliad's' theme, this is indeed a film of epic tragedy. Everybody dies. Revenge is the cycle unbound and unending. The warrior kills until he is killed and then his champion's kill the killers. This is the cycle of the ancient world, the cycle that the civilized world seeks to unbind. In watching this film it is quick to analyze that the warrior's soul is not the way of mankind's successful future, and so this film in a way is good history lesson from the past tale of 'The Iliad' and how not to be as a civilized world. Greek tragedy is an awesome ancient lesson that the modern world must learn from, and movie making as such does justice to popularize, but not glorify this image of tragedy. 'Troy' directed by Wolfgang Peterson teaches this lesson.'Troy' is a long film best viewed across either a lazy afternoon or two nights. The spectacle of ancient Mycenaean Greek battle is as authentic as the unknown of those times are to research from scant historical records. The weapons and tactics of the era in this movie are an attempt at authenticity, albeit a bit too much black leather going on. I think Achilles' armor would have been of the most polished brass of the time, not the dark fair that adorned the ultra fit Brad Pitt's form. But the shields, spears, swords, ships, chariots, and basic form of armor are historically correct as much as can be gleaned from rare records. The one on one battles depicted are violent and brutal, perhaps accurate, and if so, show a hacking time when man pitted upon man in ancient battle, makes the NFL look like a sewing circle.The sweep of ancient epic battles and walled cities is captured in this movie with a combination of effective digital effects and real life action. The widescreen transference from film to digital DVD is very well done without any noticed pixillation. And the women in this film's tears are heartbreakingly real. The soundtrack conveys a haunting sadness to the ear as if tragedy is always present. I was surprisingly pleased with 'Troy' both from a technical, historical, story telling, and acting point of view. Highly recommended for it's type of film fair. Epic cinema at it's highest form. 'Troy' is not quite 'Spartacus' or 'Ben Hur' but it wants to be, and is close to this type of film making. B. A. DraperNot for kids, it is rated R for extreme battle violence, tasteful sexual scenes, and disturbing adult themes of tragedy.",9,9,16,22 December 2005
Being John Malkovich," 'Being John Malkovich' - A DVD Movie Review
","Clearly, this film, is one of the oddest, most interesting, eclectic, and finally, one of the most original movies I have ever experienced.'Being John Malkovich', where do you begin with a review? It took me four nights to experience it. It has some flaws, the biggest being the character played by John Cusack - replace him, and you might have the perfect diversion for a weekend of 'what the hell was that'? As is, it is a movie that demands watching.I am still reeling as I write this review. I don't know where to begin, except to say, if you are inclined to the unusual, the bizarre, and the completely unique, you might want to check this film out. I won't even try to delve into the story, it is just too strange to relate, you have to watch it, you really do, to get it. And even then, it will leave you wondering.Acting, of note, is the amazing performance by John Malkovich . . . as himself, and many others. Quirky, egoistic, vulnerable, and self-indulgent, I think John's portrayal as himself and more is, well, it is very very different, and very brave and challenging. Cameron Diaz, how could they make her look homely? But they do, and Cameron is every bit the odd foil to Malkovich's character. Then there is the woman who plays the crux, Maxine, outstandingly performed by Catherine Keener, who in her lynch pin character, ties the film together. I would be remiss in leaving out the aging Orson Bean and the cynical young and then old Charlie Sheen. You simply have to see them in this film to appreciate.Unless you are an oddball, a thinker, and want to experience something entirely different, I can't recommend this film. But if you are so inclined, I would highly recommend this delve into the possibilities of 'what if you could be John Malkovich?'I give it 3 and 1/2 stars. Good stuff.",8,0,1,12 August 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," 'Good Night and Good Luck' a DVD Movie Review
","'Good Night and Good Luck' a DVD Movie Reviewby Bradley A. DraperThis a good TV movie, but it is not Oscar class and it certainly is not classic cinema. Nothing to stand up to and applaud. Clooney should stop producing. I am reminded of his aping of the classic 'Fail Safe' film and novel via his attempt at live TV with a retelling of a story that needed no reprise. Great movies should not be remade and those that attempt so only do so at the critic's peril. Just because you are a popular actor, George, this does not make you a directoral talent.In this film, much can be made of similarities of our own paranoid times, of the communist witch hunts of the early 1950's with todays suspectful techno intrusion on our privacy. That is what this movie is all about. It is couched in a period piece but tries to be a political statement of our time. The clichés are even chosen for this affect. Not that our time does not need reflection. But today's political climate is far more tolerant and liberal than the early 1950's. I get letters from the ACLU almost every week. Even though I am sympathetic to their cause, I do not join, because they just want my money, and I do not want to be on anybody's list.This film is shot in stunning silver black and white. Very well done. An effective period piece, even down to the obligatory black jazz music. Still, one of the clichés that were hard to ignore was that of the cigarette. Every character it seemed smoked a million cigarettes in this movie, and they even throw in a 'Kent Cigarette' commercial, with little subtlety. Was this an indightment of cigarette smoking some how? It seemed so. This obsession with tobacco's smoke was to me very distracting.Although filmed well, and the acting, sliding into the realm of TV soap style still, was good, the writing was contrived and weak.I found the portrayal of Edward Murrow, legendary CBS World War II broadcaster, by the severe and constant jaw clenching of David Strathairn clichéd and consistently boring. The weird Fred Friendly cameo of George Clooney was unexplainable? Why, other to include his ego into a Oscar territory in a weak Oscar year. Patricia Clarkson and Robert Langella's outstanding character portrayals, were totally wasted in this film. Too bad as they are iconic character actors. And what is the point of including the sad Robert Downing Jr. in a totally inconsequential part?There is no social impact in this film, although it was very apparent that the film attempted this. I liked the movie, but it is what it is, a tiny little TV film made, to exploit the paranoia of our time, which had nothing to compare to those ultimate 'look over your shoulder 1950's.' This film, already dated, will be forgotten in six months.I give it 5 stars.",5,2,6,14 March 2006
War of the Worlds," Despite a few really terrifying moments of cinema, this is a really bad movie.
","Despite a few really terrifying moments of cinema, this is a really bad movie. Why can't anyone do H. G. Wells right? Well, in the original 1950's movie 'War of the Worlds' George Pal tried, but even they cut corners (they used 'rays' instead of tripod legs for the Martian machines.) The best of H. G. Wells to cinema is still 'The Invisible Man', 'First Men on the Moon' and 'Things to Come'.Now to dissect Steven Spielberg's nightmare of what I consider to be the worst modern SCIFI movie ever made. Steven, listen to me, you can't expect a movie to be about toasting humans elegantly as if somehow to evoke the emotions of the holocaust, then have a ten year old little cute white blond girl watch in big blue eyed scream in horror sans Dakota Fanning, and constantly put her in jeopardy: To the cheap reaction of the audience and expect that to be cinema.And you can't use Tom Cruise's mugging or tired toothy grin to pull you out of a bad script. And please, Steven, don't pull another typical Father and Son conflict out of your old magic hat to evoke drama. That crap just does not work anymore. It is hard to believe that the same man that directed 'Jaws', 'E.T. The Extraterrestrial', and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' put together, let alone signed his name to such tripe.Finally and most shamelessly, Steven, you have evoked the paranoia of a real event, that of 9/11 in your film with constant reference to 'are they terrorists?' And then to use the jingoistic display of the American flag? That is just pathetic, and Steven, you should be ashamed for exploiting these images for your profit and gain. Shame on YOU!Finally, Steven, where the heck was the plot? No where to be found. Big bad alien machines crusted up from under the streets and toasting everybody and expecting Tom Cruise's horror at the crust on his face eliciting some sort of compassion? Fantastic movie imagery was all you were after but even those images were few and far between. But who were these machines? Where did they come from? What was their agenda? How did they die? Intelligence is sorely lacking in this film. Sad in a way because Steven, you quote H. G. Wells' novel in the opening stanza. Again . . . shame on YOU!The original Victorian story of 'The War of the Worlds' was one of genuine and unique paranoia for the times. This novel (you must read it - classic stuff) has has yet to be done on film properly. In order to do the film correctly, the movie has to embody the time. It is entirely plausible during the turn of the 20th century that Mars might be a harbinger of intelligent life, given the canals of Lovell, and that Martian war machines could compete with that era's military might - but today it just does not seem credible. Oh well. I am so tired of bad movies.",Null,2,5,22 November 2005
Paths of Glory," Paths of Glory - A Movie Review
","'Paths of Glory' is one of those movies that movie making is all about. It is one of director Stanley Kubrick's earliest movies, indeed, it is his first really important film, and it is a masterpiece. Today, little is known amongst the general public regarding World War I, the great war, the war to end all wars. I study this conflict because, quite frankly, this war defines how the 20th century will evolve, World War II is merely a continuance of the first war, and the Cold War another chapter of the previous. The film is based on a book by Humphrey Cobb which I have to say, I have not read, a situation I will soon rectify. The story is about this French army regiment's failed attempt to capture a worthless position called the 'ant hill.' The attempt is doomed from the start. Generals are embarrassed and examples must be made in the form of three innocent French soldiers, court martialed for cowardliness and sentenced to death by a kangaroo court.Douglas plays these hapless men's regiment commander, and then their lawyer for defense. But every thing is rigged and so, the three men are finally shot by firing squad. Kirk Douglas' role is in a word inspired, and you can see Spartacus in his future in that intense gaze and strong dimpled chin. But the film is so much more than this thread on injustice that binds scene after scene. It is more about the experience of the everyday combat soldiers trench warfare and senseless battle that marked World War I as the first of so many senseless wars of the 20th century, and finally it is about the commander's ego at the expense of the dog faced soldier. This is an outstanding film. Four stars all the way. The writing, the acting, and the scene structure are all compelling. This is the definitive World War I movie, a subject that film gives little credence to today. It is in ultra silver black and white and filmed in a close up aspect ratio of the classic 1.33 to 1. Wide screen is what it is, but Stanley Kubrick knows the value of intimacy in regards to the original theatrical format, that all TVs use today.I got this fairly new released MGM DVD for 10 bucks at the local big book store the other day. It is truly cinematic drama at a bargain. I know I will watch it again and again.Recommended highly as high film art.",10,1,1,27 July 2004
Ben-Hur," Ben-Hur A Memorable Epic Film
","During the holidays, I get all Biblical, God fearing, and powerfully emotional. There is a lot of Sinclair Lewis' 'Elmer Gantry' in my soul. It is my upbringing I guess. The agnostic once attested that his religion is the religion of his parents and no matter what other experiences he has, he must hedge his bets. I was raised as a Christian and so . . Nevertheless, I enjoy the Biblical movies of Hollywood, and Ben-Hur is the greatest religious Hollywood spectacle of them all. Ben-Hur also titled 'A Tale of the Christ' penned by Civil War General Lew Wallace, and you are copy-write free to read on the internet, was perhaps the most popular novel of the 19th century that has several times been put on film in the 20th century.But nothing quite like the 1959 film, winner of 11 Oscars, has ever quite existed before or ever will. Star Wars only pretends at such spectacle. Directed by William Wyler, this movie is the last great and fantastic non CGI or special fake effect, it is all real action, and amazing cinema. Seeing this print, digitized from the original 65mm film into a 16x9 anamorphic that is really lost on my little 20 inch Toshiba TV screen is still incredible. I need a bigger TV. But even then in witnessing, I can't imagine any attempt to pan and scan this masterpiece of epic movie making.I will admit this film's plot plods many times but if you cut to the action it never disappoints. Regarding this action there are three scenes that satisfy.The battle of the Roman and Macedonian Trimarine ships in the Mediterranean is mind boggling. Then the resultant triumphant parade in Rome is breathtaking and telling-- the Emperor Augustus Caesar, pay attention to his gestures. Finally the climactic chariot race between Ben-Hur and Masalla, his horses are white, and the bad guy's black, is an absolute high achievement of movie making that tops even the destruction of the Death Star in 'Star Wars IV.'A thread through this film is Christ's influence on Judah Ben-Hur, although he really never get's it. Effective in this treatment is that Christ's face is never seen by the audience, only by the awe struck actors. I found this taking license with the audience's emotions. I think if I ever looked at Christ's face I would not be awe-struck but instead comforted by His love.Anyway, this awesome cinema spectacle, recently released on DVD with many many extras is recommended. I love this movie and will cherish watching it over and over again.And yes Charlton Heston still looks great in a loin cloth.",8,2,5,10 December 2005
Fantastic Four," This Film Is A Pleasant Surprise
","The Fantastic Four - A DVD Movie ReviewThe genre of super heros changed dramatically from the cartoonish 1950's DC 'Superman' and 'Batman' 10 cent comics, to the mid 1960's in a more human and realistic tale of real people thrust upon the responsibility of one day being, just regular folk--and then tomorrow--super heros, when Marvel comics created the 'Fantastic Four.'From the 'Fantastic Four' many other stories of human emotion were thrust upon the then typically susceptible teenage angst with such other super heros, that didn't want to be imbued with super powers. It was just that destiny bestowed upon these fantasy figures a great responsibility. It started with the 'Fantastic Four', but then there was 'Spiderman', the 'X-Men', 'Hulk', 'Daredevil', 'Ironman', and 'Captain America' and more. These legends on pulp paper are the stuff of my teenage hero worship.Recently to my delight, Hollywood has converted many of these Marvel heros of my youth to film. Some of these movies work. Some don't. That works include 'Spiderman', the 'X-Men' series, 'Elektra', and now the original 'Fantastic Four.'This film is a pleasant surprise. Generally given Luke warm reviews, I found it to be absolutely grounded in the comic book legend, albeit upgraded to today's time. The 'Fantastic Four' were four people that were, through coincidence thrown together, altered by cosmic rays, to possess diverse but great powers. Although these powers were different, and their personalities clashed in this story (and in the comics too), ultimately they formed that fantasy of super hero story making: The Super Hero Team.The script is pretty good. The cast is a bit young, except for Ben Grimm, but it works. And the villain in Dr. Doom is not a sissy. Dr. Doom is a really bad, scary, murderous, and powerful guy and like the 'X-Men's' Magneto he needs to be explored more. It is somewhat refreshing to watch this kind of film and look at good and bad as black and white. A side note is, that a great weakness in the Spiderman movies--is that the bad guy is really a good guy, boo hoo, I feel sorry for him--not! No, in comic book genre, the villain must be totally evil and the hero(s) must triumph over this ultimate evil.As far as the special effects go, they are really good and some unique. Sue Storm as the Invisible Girl works in invisibility and in her force field (although Jessica Alba is too young for the part but never mind--she is so beautiful), Johnny Storm as the Human Torch scorches in attitude and flame, and the CGI and prosthesis form that builds Ben Grimm's orange rock creature The Thing is outstanding. Reed Richard's Mr. Fantastic's stretching is the hardest effect to do, and in certain scenes it works well but in some it looks kind of cheesy.Regardless, all in all I really liked this film and recommend it. By the way, the villain, Dr. Doom survives, to suggest menace another day (a necessary comic book commodity), and as this was essentially a super hero 'origin' film I full expect another 'Fantastic Four' movie. The extras on the DVD were average and the DVD transference was a bit dark - not bad but a little muddy. Now, I am just waiting for an intelligent 'Captain America' and 'Ironman' Marvel film to be made.P.S. The Great Stan Lee, creator of the comic 'Fantastic Four' did a cameo in 'The Fantastic Four' as a mailman. Sweet. But you gotta be a comic book geek to get that one.",8,0,4,7 December 2005
