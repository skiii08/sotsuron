Men in Black 3," Boring and unimaginative....
","Seriously? You have three massive acting talents in this movie and you can't even write a meaningful scene. I understand this is supposed to be lighthearted summer fare, but when your script doesn't even allow Wil Smith a laugh, you are in deep, deep trouble. The interaction between the two main characters, whom we know so very well by now, is not dynamic, playful, or engaging. It is abrasive, annoying, and toxic. It doesn't make you laugh, it makes you cringe. Fourteen years of working together to fend off alien menaces and these two don't can't engage one another. Shabby writing beefed up by expensive effects. The plot...what plot? We sat through this movie so that we could find out along with Agent J that hid dad was murdered by an alien during a rocket launch? and K hid this from him why? I sat through Green Lantern's entirety and yet I almost walked out of this 'film' if I may use the term so poorly. Terrible to see someone as talented as Tommy Lee Jones in another horrible movie. This one makes me eager to see his sequel to the cheerleader chaperone vehicle. Who the hell is his agent???",3,5,11,17 June 2012
