The King's Speech," Prince William's Great-Grandpa Finds his WAR Voice..Inspires his Nation!
","Nothing like well-told history to make a GREAT story!Set mostly in late 1930s... The Current Queen of England (Queen Elisabeth)(Grandmother to Prince William... was a young girl when her father Albert became King George the 6th. Albert (a shy, stuttering man) is shoved into the job after a lifetime of believing that his elder, popular brother David will be the next King. So...Morally Weak Older Brother is going to give back the Throne soon...he wishes to marry Mrs. Wallis Simpson, a woman unacceptable as a potential Queen. But David is truly the Most Unacceptable One... David is a security and 'courage' risk for the throne...and some historians today believe he was too friendly to Nazi leaders to have rallied Britain in World War 2.So...David resigns. Albert must speak...for the nation. Who can help Albert overcome his huge stutter! Enter Lionel Logue and his bizarre personal speech techniques.The self-educated Lionel Logue forms a friendship with this shy, but high born and sheltered leader. Logue eventually wins the King's trust...and helps him speak successfully (if slowly) in public.Does a King speaking in public seem to be 'no big deal'? Understand that radio was the social media...and that Brits faced the fight of their life...as most of their leaders had spent many years actually DISarming Britain...even as they KNEW the Nazis were acquiring armies and weapons! I have a minor historical quibble...In real life, Churchill publicly supported Albert's controversial older brother David and wished him to stay a King...contrary to the movie's Churchill.In Churchill's bio, he admits that his wife Clementine was right to stand by the new king--Overall, My enjoyment of this movie was ENHANCED by my knowledge of World War 2; but viewers with little WW 2 knowledge will still be entranced...and who knows...some may get hooked on history!May Prince William consider the valor of his great-grandfather as he someday leads the country!",9,0,0,21 April 2011
The Monuments Men," A good movie for art/WW2 geeks...Perhaps a starting point for more research on the real Monuments Men (and that AMAZING real life French woman!!!)
","I actually liked this movie. Not great, but not bad. Some say that the movie is not really like the real 'Monuments Men' detailed in the book of the same name this movie is said to be based on...So, time to find the MM book!!!But if this film gets people started on researching the Monuments Men that's great.And the real life woman (the basis for Cate Blanchett's fictional museum lady) is a big hero!!! But it's not so much about fighting as it is about outwitting the Nazis...and the Russians who were quickly advancing across Germany (who were like the Nazis in...their desire to just grab artworks for themselves)...I'm not a fan of George Clooney (his politics) but find it interesting that he recognizes the great importance of preserving one's culture and one's history...for the next generation.",7,1,2,21 May 2014
Star Trek," Fairly good Star Trek; but not suitable for very young kids
","This is a fairly good redo of Star Trek origins. (Yes, I saw the very first Star Trek and so on...). Yet it's not for grade school kids unless you want to have them snicker when Kirk grabs Uhura's chest and when he is on top of a woman in a quick bedroom scene...However, the rest of the film is suitable for most grade school and older kids...if they like fast paced action and stylized sci fi types of action...! ***** (Suggest parents view the DVD & plan to skip these 2 early scenes...We all know Captain Kirk was a ladies' man in the 60's TV show without seeing detail...and this film already establishes Kirk's reputation as a brash ladies' man before these two brief scenes retell the 'Kirk likes women' idea...Otherwise, maybe later family TV versions of STAR TREK will edit out these minor sexual portions...the main plot is unharmed!The casting, more than the special effects, will help us middle-aged Trekkies connect back to that great ORIGINAL TV Show...and may well inspire young Treksters to view the great original Star Trek TV series on DVD. The best moments on the TV show were not the now-weak special effects...but the character interaction.Ah, yes, good characters, good script live on forever...The 1960's Spock, Captain Kirk, 'Bones', 'Scotty', Uhuru and Sulu are echoed by their 2009 counterparts. Spoiler is - Old original Spock is in this movie.",6,1,5,20 November 2009
"I, Robot"," Chicago (the city) is a Character in this movie!
","Liked the movie.Chicago...is another 'character' so to speak. The digital 2035 Chicago skyline includes leave some of the ACTUAL futuristic buildings (like the Hancock and Sears towers. They realistically leave some of the late Victorian buildings and such in the residential and fringe Loop areas intermingled.Probably they could have pushed the Chicago architecture's cutting edge even further...but I am grateful for some attention to Chicago's fabulous downtown cutting edge architecture.A few other films have suggested Chicago's long history (at least since the huge 1877 Chicago fire) in setting building trends...where you go to work past archaic buildings which were new to your great grandparent immigrants, which are juxtaposed to Mies Van der Rohe mid 20th Century skyscrapers, which are nearby the still cutting edge Sears Tower or 333 North Wacker buildings which will still look modern to your children.There is a precedent for the Chicago architecture influence as a futurist look...The 1927 futuristic German film METROPOLIS has a painted skyscraper background which--generically--replicates the overall look of early Chicago concrete and steel skyscrapers...so there is precedent for relying on the underused...but so rich in texture and past/future juxtapositions that are regularly seen in Chicago.",7,0,0,27 November 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Should Palin's Daughters THANK Left-leaning Clooney???
","Just change 'left' to 'right'. Some in government and in most powerful media outlets are REGULARLY slandering, harassing, blatantly misquoting...thru words and videotape manipulation...those they disagree with. You know the names & persons...Just change left to right. GOOD LUCK>>> may well become like HIGH NOON. An well done film that (however inadvertently) becomes a rallying image for a quite different cause or group!!!Thus, HIGH NOON was the MAIN ICON used by Poles in the 1980s Solidarity poster and protest wars againt the Communist bullies:...Today, Lech Walesa still signs Gary Cooper HIGH NOON posters.And as a widow of one of the newsmen says in the attached GOOD NIGHT... documentary about the fearful Fifties, 'It was a fearful time...'.And thus, left leaning George Clooney (who yet honored some truths here) uses drama to denounce those who harass, humiliate, lie about, even viciously denigrate - those they disagree with.However unententionally, this film is a call for all journalists (and all GOVT officials) not to abuse their power to slander, denigrate, regularly misquote, even name call...others. Especially individual citizens!!!Mr. Radulovich, a harassed private citizen owed Murrow, etc. some thanks...(Thus, Sarah Palin's daughters might owe this film (as well as MOM) some thanks!!!)",7,0,1,19 June 2009
Pride & Prejudice," Teach your kids to love P&P - show them this Sassy Version!
",Keira Knightley's Pride & Prejudice is...Not too REVERENT to Pride & Prejudice - the book. (The book - once you get used to the slightly archaic language - is loaded with witty stuff!) Joe Wright's version blows the dust off Jane Austen's amusing look at courtship & marriage...and YES - show this P&P DVD to your kids...before they read Jane Austen's great book! Keira Knightley never takes herself as lead 'Elisabeth Bennet' too seriously...you never get that weighty deadly 'we are making a CLASSIC here...' tone - which sucks the life from some productions of Pride & Prejudice.Buy---Watch---Enjoy!,9,2,3,22 February 2011
National Treasure," Know your history - Solve the Puzzle - Maybe find the treasure!!!
","Why would anyone steal the Declaration of Independence? The purported 'map' on the back of it is a fictional plot device...(just like the large stone ball rolling down after Indiana Jones - is fiction). It sets off a great adventure! In this fictional story, real life history clues are intertwined into the plot - as Nicholas Cage (as Ben Gates) Diana Kruger (as Dr. Chase) and others race ahead of Sean Bean's sinister gang...to get the Treasure of all Treasures...Clues take you to various Eastern Seaboard historical sites - museums, bell towers, and more...with the bad guys in full pursuit. Sean Bean is a great villain! --------- It's a quality film that will probably be 'minimized' by some into the family category since gratuitous sexuality, excessive violence, or cuss words are not used to put it into the 'r' classification.Watch! And invite the youth to watch - This action film might give them a CLUE that history can be fascinating.",8,0,1,2 June 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Too long -- too distorted --- and (the biggest sin of all) too DULL
","Is it FICTION or FACT? (Spoiler soon.) The scholar Leigh Teabing reveals the secret in this too long film - that some Catholic group (Opus Dei) will kill and torture to suppress....Teabing claims that bloodthirsty churchmember fans of Dan Brown's cardboard 'jesus' long ago decided to kill thousands (maybe millions), brutally oppress women and be as ruthless as any mafia in keeping the big secret. The supposed secret (based on incredibly bad scholarship) was that 'jesus' married Mary Magdalene (per some spurious ancient texts long passed over as - fake). And the French girl Sophie is 'jesus's' descendant - so she is the living 'holy grail' that the church mafia types wish to murder. And since Teabing turns out to be the villain, the film/book can 'officially' VERBALLY step away from his claim. ...+++++There are many websites, scholarly books to debunk this most silly set of half baked truth claims. The movie has the big name actors and rides on the publicity from a highly controversial book. Ron Howard (who has directed quality films elsewhere) joins Dan Brown & co to do the 'Mapplethorpe' to the Christian faith and say 'It's just art! It's merely fiction!' as they pocket their bankroll.In the movie's second scene, Tom Hank's character justaposes various potent visual images on the screen as he talks about the POWER of the IMAGE.. It's a clue to the not so secret slant of the movie. Technically, Hank's character is not saying that Spanish priests (dressed in white hooded robes) ARE like the KKK, but the VISUAL image clearly implies this. Most visual images for Christianity (incluing some of the artwork and statues as well as most all the film's Jesus followers) are shown as evil, tormented, cruel, and or strangely laden with secret meanings just discovered...so that one wants to breathe a sigh of false 'relief' at the film's claim of religious 'fraud'. This is masterful manipulation. Plainly portrayed, but verbally denied by the participants. ***** But to those who want to TEST truth claims - even in a fiction story - Research the pagan era. It's not the glorious era hinted at by this movie...Our ancestors turned from the 'cold cruel night of paganism' to leave such things as...Women as temple prostitutes (Hinted at in this movie - developed more in the book)--Infants (especially girls or the disabled) exposed to die--Slaves who were no longer fit thrown on the streets to die (and then taken in and nursed by early Christians)...and various examples of human sacrifice as well as a general contempt for human life. That truly was the beastly era. This movie could be called 'Seducing Sophie'. For the Feminine in full blast Paganism is 'the abused'.",3,1,2,10 September 2008
Man on Fire," Good acting--setting but WAY TOO LONG and dragged out movie!
","'YAWN' Good actors/interesting Mexico city setting and people/but 146 minutes? Really? Moderately decent plot but---CUT this movie down and make it...better! I bought the DVD because it (at $5 ) looked like a good deal, since I've enjoyed other Denzel Washington films.I fast forwarded through some scenes once I got to the 'hunt them all down' portion.NOTE...this is not a young child family film. Dakota Fanning gave a fine performance, but the scenes of kidnapping, violence and some sexuality are (in my opinion) not good for a small child...her age! 176 minutes!!! Some film student needs to get permission to edit this thing down...into a crisper, tighter film!",5,2,4,21 January 2013
WALL·E," Wall*E Caring for the Disabled; Valuing those with imperfections!
","Yes, there's the politically correct 'too much garbage and too much commercialism' stuff...But what SHINES OUT is - Wall*E caring for the (apparently) comatose Eve...Reminds me of seeing an elderly man lovingly wheel his disabled wife around...of parents adopting an abused wheelchair bound child in Foster Care...of my uncle caring for my once-comatose aunt...And nice to see that the 'defective' robots (in a scene which seems to be a 'mental ward') are needed to defeat the bad guys---Even their frantic or bizarre behaviors confound the well programmed robot warriors...That's the POLITICALLY UNFASHIONABLE but HUMAN AFFIRMING message that will make Wall*E at least a good movie 30 years from now...",9,4,6,6 November 2009
Stalag 17," War comedy for older teens, adults - Some great moments.
","I wanted to shout 'The Battle of the Bulge is almost over. Next Christmas - HOME!'.Yes, this film is bit of a caricature. The hammy guy doing the mail delivery, the gags on the Germans (I love the 'Many Adolfs' gag); Animal (Richard Strauss) slobbering over real-life WWII pinup photos of Betty Grable; the fake-jolly cutesy German guard (Sig Rumann); and the typical nasty Nazi (Otto Preminger) - all wisecrack their way thru this cold dreary December...You can see where Hogan's Heroes came from.Septin (William Holden) is the POW shyster who runs his various businesses making money off his suspicious co-prisoners.He has made so much off his fellow prisoners that he can even bribe the guards to let him go in and hook up with some Russian female prisoner in the next camp. This rather unbelievable event is part of the first part of the movie. Think 1960's Hogan's Heroes TV series! What's the crisis? A Traitor - a German soldier disguised as a fellow POW is in their midst.Septin is their top suspect. Here, the movie gets serious (mostly).The German spy (disguised as fellow POW)finds out how the new prisoner blew up a trainload of ammo. How will the POWs get the new prisoner away from the Nazis before the Gestapo gets the POW saboteur? How can they silence the German spy without getting shot by the Germans in reprisals??? It's not as good as THE GREAT ESCAPE, but is still worth watching.Here, the parts are more than the whole. Various scenes will stick with you. Watch to see!",6,0,2,29 September 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Quality Adaptation of Great Tolkein Novels. Great work, Peter Jackson, etc...
","The title gives away the ending...But these 3 films are great because they do almost everything WELL! Many great, believable characters, wonderful (though complex) story line, hundreds of costumes, special effects, including nuanced, computerized special effects, believable villains (notably Smeagol/Gollum - the lowly bad guy who still will influence Frodo - for good or ill...)...Film students - this adaptation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is worth intense study. Peter Jackson & co. did just about everything well. The long, long list of awards tells you his peers noted this.This highly complex three film series is to the average film - as the multi level D-Day invasion was to the typical battle.And speaking of battles, I agree that Sean Astin's Samwise is the best character of all. He is probably like the World War I foot soldiers Tolkein served with (called Tommies). The average guy who wants to get back home - who steps up to be the little-known person who helps win the battle...",9,0,1,25 October 2008
The Truman Show," Carrey's tragic/comedic face...and LOTS of public/private spy cams!
","I may be rating this unusual film too low! Read the many good analyses of this film---(unless you have not seen the movie---Go watch it first)!!! This 1998 film is sorta PROPHETIc of 2009 & on...See all the cameras on the streets/ in the stores/on our computer/or the neighbor's hidden cell phone...watching us??? (Think of Truman Show's 5000 tiny cameras...You can see some when rewatching this movie!) And what of the high up controller/director?He (the great Ed Harris) acts like a protective dad to Carrey's character...but Carrey's possible death is a risk Ed Harris is willing to take! Will 'godlike' persons experimenting wildly with our social order & mores...similarly be willing to do their 'society manipulating' practices even if playing with the mores' of society damages many of us??? And all the while, Carrey's wife tells us of the latest in kitchen products...and that she's made MACARONI for dinner...!",8,0,1,3 May 2009
