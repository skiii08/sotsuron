Blade Runner 2049," This movie dropped me on the floor
","Everybody loves it. It got top ratings everywhere. Man was I disappointed. I fully blame the director for destroying what could've been a worthy sequel to the original Blade Runner, which is a piece of art. The movie is pretentious and tries so hard to be deeper than it is. It sounds like I'm just gonna trash this movie and I'm not. It has a lot going for it, especially in catching up from the original, since its been 30 years. The visuals and the sound design is amazing, the cinematography is top notch. But the storytelling... falls flat. For 97 percent of the movie you stare at Ryan Goslings face. I get it, chicks dig him, but I think his face burned into my eyes and not in a good way. He has the same acting skill as a milk carton and brought no emotion to the character. I guess you could argue, his acting fitted the bill but hey... no spoilers. The movie is extremely long and despite using the screen time it never has a climax. Like... a real one. Im such a huge fan of the original and it pains me to write this split review. I kinda wish this movie never saw the light of day, because once its seen it can never be unseen. Honestly I was just as disappointed when I saw 'The Arrival' made by the same director, so I guess its his style. He certainly made this movie his own. I just wish he didn't have to take art and destroy it the way he does here. I guess people will praise him for this movie - cause now it can be seen by anyone... now Blade Runner finally became: mainstream.",6,10,23,5 October 2017
