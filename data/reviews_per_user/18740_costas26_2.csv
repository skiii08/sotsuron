10 Cloverfield Lane," Spielberg influenced suspense thriller from J.J. Abrams and Co.
","The film is ingeniously made in that it is in effect two or three movies worked into one. Regardless, the structure is not forced at all, the storyline unfolds very naturally and builds up on mystery, suspense, paranoia and action.The leads, particularly the show-stopping John Goodman, give electrifying performances. The Hitchcockian and Spielbergian influences are evident and the result is beyond satisfying. This is a marvel of a film and one which is scarcely made in the 2000s.The pace, the story, the action work well in parallel with the character development. This is a story of survival and endurance, of dealing with fear and facing 'monsters' which come in all shapes and sizes.This is a must-see film for movie lovers. I will not even begin classifying it and compartmentalizing it to a particular genre, this is a good movie all around.",8,0,2,30 April 2016
Captain America: Civil War," The Ultimate Marvel Movie Experience
","Everything in the MCU has been leading to the production of this masterfully made film. Marvel has yet to make a dud of a film and they seem to have been developing their style, choice in filmmakers and talent involved.All of Marvel's efforts over the first two phases of the MCU has yielded Captain America: Civil War. This movie is action packed, a political thriller, a chase film, a character piece with a human heart. Critics and public opinion dismissing the movies produced by Marvel Studios as mere 'superhero' films have either not watched enough of these movies or they need to watch this one.The cast has proved by now that they work well together as an ensemble and the main trio at the heart of the story Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr and Sebastian Stan deliver human, vulnerable and heartbreaking performances.Superhero comic books and as a consequence their films have since their inception been adapting and mirroring real life issues and struggles of the real world at the period of their issue. This film is no exception. Dealing with themes such as power, loss, family, friendship and forming basic human connections. The movie marks the strongest addition to the Marvel slate and beyond initial enthusiasm may rank as one of the greatest superhero films of all time, if not the greatest.Character development has not suffered at the expense of the presence of the variety of superheroes sharing the screen. The story is well crafted and the ideology spurring the civil war convincing.The new additions to the cast, the long awaited younger version of Spiderman and the ever intriguing Black Panther of Wakanda have worked well within the storyline and provided each of the aforementioned superheroes with a very satisfying origin story to make the transition to their own feature length films smoother.An absolute achievement from the Russo brothers with the only desire left being at least a mild reference to the TV Show world which would undoubtedly be influenced by the events in the film. An amazing and unprecedented superhero film with a heart, a human heart. A must see.",9,14,29,30 April 2016
