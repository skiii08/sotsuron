Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Eye candy
","The whole movie is eye candy ..... nothing more and sadly something less!Fewer characters, more emotion, more heart, simpler backgrounds (instead of fleets of ships buzzing like mosquitoes in every second shot)would have been appreciated.The lightsabre duel with Darth Maul caught my attention ...but ONE scene in a 2 1/2 hr movie? I thought Lucas could have done better, so what went wrong? Lucas himself did, here's how!In 1976 nobody wanted to know about Lucas's 'Little' project called Star Wars.In 1998 everybody was counting down until the release of anything Lucas had put together.In 1977 Lucas was kept to a small budget of 9.5 million when most movies around the time getting the green light had 3 x that budget. Lucas had to make his movie LESS about space battles and MORE about the characters.In 1999 Lucas was so rich that he S###T money and had the autonomy to make his movie any way he wanted without anyone second guessing his script (you know the type ...they're called screenwriters!)He also had the ability to use more special effects than anyone else!Jeff Goldblum had a line in Jurrasic park that is relevant. To paraphrase 'You were so busy finding out if you could, you never stopped to think whether you should!'Sorry Lucas ....... a small mars bar on screen is nice but too much eye candy just rots the viewer's brain! (Presuming people who saw multiple viewings had one at all)",Null,0,1,6 September 1999
Rocky V," 'You're all heart Rock, you know that?' - Paulie
","This movie has heart, lots of it! I love a good fight scene as well as the next man but if you wanted a fighter with no heart (or brains) you should have seen a Van Damme movie instead!!Rocky's saga spans 5 movies with this being the final instalment. He started out as a thumb breaker for a local gangstar with low quality ring brawls with bums for extra money...but he believed in himself as a person way back then.He believed he was good enough to go out with Adrian in the first movie, in the second movie he was good enough to be a husband and father, in the third he was good enough to start from scratch with a man who had previously been his opponent, in the fourth he was good enough to win over a hostile crowd.You'll notice that what I have taken from the first 4 films is not the ring fighting prowess of ROCKY but his heart in each film. He wins ring fights because he wins life's battles first! Look at Mike TYSON, he was an unbeatable force in the ring but outside it he was pummelled by everyone....managers, ex-wives, beauty pageant entrants etc he never won one battle in life outside the ring, that's why despite his fight paycheck,...he has nothing!At the end of Rocky V, Rocky has no money, hence the line 'I'll sue!', 'For What?' (WHACK!) but he has his pride, his wife, his son's respect and most importantly, his life to go on with. He's a winner because he has people he loves and they love him. Titles and belts don't mean that much when you TRULY recognise what your family are.The Rocky saga ..... many pale imitators but no one will match the heart!",Null,6,7,5 September 1999
X-Men," I am X-tremely X-ited about this X-hilarating Adventure
","I saw this on its opening day of July 12 in Australia. Having watched the animated TV series about 9 years ago I knew a 'Fair' amount about the X men but I wasn't a long term fan of the comic (never bought one). So was I expecting to grow to love the characters of this Bryan Singer film in only 2 hours?Y-E-S!!!! From Magneto's heartbreaking separation from his parents, to Rogue's near fatal bedroom pash to Wolverine's 'X-treme Fighting' introduction, I was instantly gripped by these characters. The writing was flawless, the plot moved along very fast but for an action movie I was amazed how little this adventure was plot driven and how majorly it was character driven.I couldn't believe I was looking at Hugh Jackman, the musical theatre pretty boy as the meanest toughest superhero of them all, Wolverine.......what an acting standout! He even stole the show away from Patrick Stewart and that is no small feat. When I saw how far down the list Anna Paquin's name was on posters I thought 'She'll be lucky to even say anything in the movie let alone act up to her potential........all I can say is the on screen pairing of Wolverine and Rogue is Cinema magic.....I cried when 'That' scene (you know the one....let sleeping dogs lie....)occurred.In fact the whole movie overwhelmed me emotionally. I went 'Wow!' at the action and most action movies don't do that to me (seen one building explode you've seen them all) but the fight scenes, especially the one on top of the Statue of Liberty were fantastic. It was also symbollic to fight for justice and humanity on the symbol of liberty I thought.Everything was spot on, the bickering of Cyclops and Wolverine, the calm cold war chess game mind set between proffessor X and Magneto and the mesmerizing body of Mystique made sure I didn't look away from the screen once during the whole movie.......heck I even stayed right to the last credit in case there was a 'One Shot' to give a clue of a sequel.....The best comic book to screen adaption EVER, even outdid Superman the Movie and that is the ultimate compliment.10/10",Null,0,0,17 July 2000
Forrest Gump," A movie about what life is REALLY about!
","Forrest Gump holds a special place in my heart. My son is intellectually disabled and I hope his life will be a full as Forrest's (without going to war though....pass on that one!).The characters are all spot on. What young man hasn't been secretly in love with a 'Jenny' who spurned his love when it wasn't convenient but needed it when the frivolous part of her life was over. The pop singer Prince once had a line in a song 'Life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last!'.From the passing of Forrest's mother to Bubba to Jenny Forrest outlived them all and was somehow a better person, a more complete human being for the experience.10/10 for a movie with heart.PS  The gunfire and napalm scenes in the jungle were brilliant!",Null,0,2,20 September 1999
American Beauty," Barbie's Ken has just become Action-Man
","A truly excellent example of how everyone has a skeleton in their closet and how sooner or later someone opens the door and gets killed in the avalanche of bones.What an amazing assortement of characters in this one little suburban street of anywhere, America. There's the man in midlife suppressed in his individuality by his wife's obsession to be better than everyone else......the spoilt daughter who has everything materialistically she could want (molded in mother's image there) but can't feel loved because it wasn't a priority growing up ......... a young man physically and psychologically abused by his father looking for a way out and only finding it in a fantasy world of drugs and video moments, not reality ....... a pompous little pretty girl who thinks the world was created so she would have an audience to bask in her percieved magnificence......a wife who self medicates her depression instead of confronting her husband's demons....... and a gay couple.The above paragraph strangely enough could also have come from my personal journal describing neighbours, work colleagues and relatives. I have seen discovered secrets ruin many lives around me and I am a  'Lester' of sorts. What you see is what you get, no pretences and certainly no excuses. This guy was the embodiment of myself taken to the nth degree in everyway, he is my hero.When you are losing the game of life, playing by society's rules do as he did ..........reinvent the game so you can win on your terms and make losers out of the other participants.What was the most important realisation in the film? Look at the 2 most underused characters in the film......the 2 jims. The screenplay glides by these 2, not because the film has nothing to say about homosexuality, but because the film is about what destroys souls........not being true to yourself destroys you. These 2 had no skeletons, no secrets, no 'appearances of success' apart from reality. There was nothing beyond their appearance, nothing to strip away and therefore by movie's end they were the only characters that wouldn't have to forever change their attitudes......everyone else had to take stock and wake up to themselves.Lesters of the world unite !!!! ......now where is that personell office address for my work? I'm starting my 'I Rule!' job description paper today!",Null,0,0,29 February 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park part 2 would have been a better Title
","Some reviewers of this movie were expecting a movie adaption of Michael Crichton's second dinosaur novel and they were disappointed!  The screenplay to 80% of the Lost World movie  actually comes from his first novel now including all of the scenes that they wanted in the first one but couldn't fit in due to the length of the film.The proof of this theorum is the following scenes are all depicted in the first novel:1.  Opening scene of young girl feeding a Compsognathus (compy) in the grass and being bitten.2.  Sarah HARDING's character being an expert in carnivores3.  Stegosaurs with offspring4.  T-rex hunted down and shot with tranquilizer dart by Roland Tembo (in 1st JP novel, Muldoon hunted down rex in this manner).5.  Dieter slides down hill to be pecked to death by group of Compies (in 1st JP novel Hammond met his demise this way!).6.  When group of people run from T-rex into waterfall it sticks its head in and licks one eerily with it's tongue.7.  Pteradons appear at the end of the film (they were involved in an aerial attack in first JP novel and this almost became a complete scene with them in this movie but was cut in favour of the  'Rex does Godzilla' scene late into production).I personally loved this movie because it included those scenes that I wished were in the first film but didn't appear.This film is Jurassic park part 2 the same way Superman 2 flows into Superman the movie.Well done Spielberg, can't wait for the third in the trilogy.PS The other thing I like about both of the JP movies is that not one dinosaur is killed by a human in either film, thereby not reducing the dinos to the role of simple monsters.9/10.",Null,1,2,26 September 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Nostrodamus couldn't predict as well !!!
","Arthur C CLARKE and KUBRICK couldn't have been closer to a modern day documentary if they tried!!Consider these coincidences .... we have re-usable aircraft looking ships called shuttles that travel to our orbit and back (as they depicted)... scarier still, the pictures of the next model of shuttles (starting @2001) look like those portrayed on film.The whole world is banding together to build a massive space station that will allow all space faring countires to dock their shuttles there.Space missions can be aborted on the launch platform because an onboard computer monitoring the safety of the crew reports a problem (HAL anyone???)They were even realistic enough not to put gravity in the spacecrafts without showing how revolution causes gravity (as in the Earth's rotation, stupid!) somehow knowing that we wouldn't have conquered that one yet!It scares me how much science fact this science fiction movie is!!!9/10. (It loses 1 for the obvious men in gorilla suits at the start)PS Did everyone GET the theme told without words with the apes and again through HAL's voice? Every time man makes a forward leap in intelligence he uses it to destroy before he learns to create on the next level.",Null,1,2,28 August 1999
Toy Story," Not to be missed!!!!
",This is probably the best effort Disney has ever put into a movie and it shows!The animation can not be faulted (I even noticed reflections in polished wood tables when the toys walk across them!) the attention to detail in this digital world was brilliant.The characters were hilarious and I still laugh in all the same places after multiple viewings. It's a movie about friendship and doing the right thing after you make a mistake. A valuable lesson for young children.The jokes for adults are spot on aswell such as the quick 'Blink and you'll miss it' scene where Mr Potatohead mocks another toy by taking his mouth off and patting his rear end with it. The word 'A##kisser!' immediately came to mind and I laughed for ages at that alone! It was also subtle enough for young children watching to miss it altogether which shows how cleverly this movie was put together.Can't wait for the sequel!10/10 even better than Bug's Life (another Disney / Pixar collaboration) and that's high praise indeed!,Null,0,0,26 September 1999
Toy Story 2," Best Film of 1999
","I loved this movie! The advances in computer animation were superb.....from Buzz's video game to the stubble on Al's chin.The humour was wonderful, they took situations from the first movie, reversed the roles and made them funny in a bright new way!Well done pixar and disney. You've got a winner.......long after pokemon is gone this movie will be played on dvd (or future equivelant) for my grandchildren 30 years from now.10/10",Null,0,0,23 December 1999
Total Recall," Merrily, Merrily, Merrily,Merrilly Quaid is just a dream!
","That's the BIG question isn't it? Was Quad a REAL memory of HOUSER or was HOUSER an implanted dream of QUAID's?VERHOEVEN takes us on a cleverly edited and cleverly written story that leaves you wondering at the end just which scenario of the movie was the real one. I own this movie on video and have watched it over 20 times and I pick up new clues with each viewing.......the trouble is there are about 12 clues that HOUSER is real and QUAID is fake...... AND .........about 12 clues that QUAID is real and HOUSER is fake!Even the ending doesn't let you know! Unlike 'Wild Things' which I really liked also, Recall doesn't let anything away even if you patiently sat through the credits looking for another clue either way.With the upcoming sequel they will probably let us know one way or the other and that's a shame because agonizing over the character of SCHWARZENEGGER is one of the best excuses for playing it again when friends visit (Eric you've been warned!).Until then watch it again and see if you can work it out!",Null,0,1,5 September 1999
The Green Mile," Visit the Green Mile, it will make you smile!
","What can I say about Tom Hanks movies that hasn't been said before? probably nothing different but here goes......The first time I cried listening to Tom Hanks voice while watching a movie scene with his powerful acting was 'Philadelphia' and I didn't know any gay people.....The second time was when he visited Jenny's grave under the tree in 'Forrest Gump', and I'd never lost a lover.The third time was in 'saving Private Ryan' and I never lost anyone in a war.Now I've just seen 'The Green Mile' and sobbed myself silly over John Coffey, and yet I've never cared about ONE SINGLE prisoner on this earth.Something about Tom Hanks name on the poster of any movie says to me 'Purchase tissues before entering cinema'. Of course I didn't cry FOR Hanks in this movie, rather WITH him (and every single person in the cinema with me). Some movies you miss a line here and there because of opening chip packets or chatter between bored viewers being overheard. With 'The Green Mile' you miss lines from nose blowing, breath catching mid cry and sniffling back the runny nose and tears.I LOVED this movie and what it said ------ it didn't hit you over the head with its spirituality either which i liked. I am appalled by the evangelistic style 'Events' that are staged by so-called faith healers today, trying to get you to join their one true church of god to be healed (credit cards accepted of course)and pushing their own agenda before you get 'healed' which of course you don't.  No, John COFFEY truly was a spiritual man, one who's spirit was powerful and therefore didn't need to preach in order to share his soul with others.That's what I feel spirituality is ...... not organised religion or churches, rather it is the honest love between one another of people. When Coffey said 'it's the same all over the world, they kill them with their love!' I understood! I hope we all can understand one day and stop man's inhumanity to man.The best film I have ever seen!   10/10PS to Haley Joel OSMET, sorry kid, you'll be crying too soon! On Oscar night your little gold man will be stolen away from you by the biggest black guy in Hollywood. He's not a bully, he's the embodiment of love, he's Michael Clarke Duncan, winner of this year's Best Supporting Actor Oscar.......trust me, he will be!.....just hope they move the stage lights up high so he doesn't bump his head on them, he's HUGE!",Null,0,0,29 February 2000
The Sixth Sense," Will you see the plot twist coming? I think not!!!!
","I was the only one in my group of friends who hadn't seen the Sixth Sense by the new year. Lucky for me they really are true friends and they spared me any likelihood of discovering the truth behind this movie accidently from idle conversation between them.All that I knew of this movie before seeing it was this:1.  EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE was impressed by it! 2.  It was Bruce Willis's best role since Die Hard 3.  The boy playing the disturbed child Cole should get an Oscar nomination 4.  Toni Collette has picked a winner to expand her movie career. 5.  There is a 'Shock' ending that no one guessed beforehand.Being a movie buff and quite fond of thrillers I thought I could solve this one, so I watched the movie, paid attention to every scene and every piece of dialogue and thought I had it.......i thought you were going to discover that Bruce Willis' ex patient from the start of the film would be Cole's dad..........WRONG WRONG WRONG!I was so off the mark it wasn't funny..... I didn't have a clue. When I found out what the movie was REALLY about I turned to my wife and she looked back at me in one of those 'Wow that's freaky!' kind of looks.I will show the same respect to others as was shown to me and NOT reveal the secret of The Sixth Sense, all I can say is WOW !!!!!Not to be missed 10/10.PS The scene between Cole and his mum in the car late in the film made my wife and I cry!",Null,0,0,7 January 2000
Casino," I looked in the desert for holes!!!
","I took my family to Vegas in October 98. While driving through the Nevada desert I couldn't help looking into the dirt to see if the wind had exposed any shallow 'Holes'. The movie Casino was still THAT vivid in my mind.I don't know anything about 'House odds' or professional gambling but I still couldn't help watching the casino staff ....you know - the dealer watches you, the floor manager watches him, the cameras watch...etc.When a limo driver said to us while driving,'...you know this place was alot different when the mob owned it..' I replied 'yes I know. I've seen the movie!'it's scary how some movies are just entertainment and others make you stop and go WHOA! I'm just glad I didn't witness any heart attacks (electric cattle prod anyone?) or else I would have been really freaked.I loved Las vegas. The whole city is one big movie soundstage! Scorcese really knew a diamond in the rough when he signed on to make this....and at half the price of waterworld, just shows you can get quality without big money but you never recoup big money without quality.PS Joe Pesci just cuts me up. The funniest gangster ever, even better than his Goodfellas role, and that's high praise indeed!10/10",Null,1,1,5 September 1999
The Thin Red Line," What a Complete waste of Time!
","Being Australian, I am proud to think that our film crews and locations are finally being recognised by America for high quality film making, so when i heard that the war drama Thin red line was being filmed here I was wrapped. A movie with Nick Nolte, John Travolta, John Cusack, Elias Koteas, Woody harelson and Sean Penn would be awesome and do wonders for the local industy.............and then I saw this movie, which in good light makes a more than passing resemblence to a floater in a toilet bowl!The film was nominated for a sqillion Oscars (including editing??????) why I must ask? The film was disjointed it couldn't decide which characters to focus on so whenever a member of Charlie Company died we didn't even know him well enough to even care at all!  I won't make the obvious comparison to Saving Private Ryan but you can't spend 170 minutes in a cinema with people on screen that don't interest you.All of the big names were wasted in this production, even PENN and NOLTE who were at least allowed to speak for more than 4 minutes onscreen. I can only summize that their sole reasons for agreeing to take part in this claptrap were to get a holiday in Queensland during filming.save your money, save your bored sole, save the world ....seek out the original print of this film and Bar-b-que it!!!Rating out of 10?  Can I use fractions or decimals?",Null,0,1,12 November 1999
Contact," Did I not Get It or Something????
","Friends of mine have rated this movie highly because they believe it shows that science is about disproving faith and the ending proves them wrong. While I sort of agree with that sentiment it meant that Jodie Foster's character did not GROW in any way from the ending of the film.It wasn't a path of discovery, an awakening of her untapped faith as some think. It was just a scientist realising that her original theory was wrong when presented with the conclusion.Hypothetically, If 1 scientist says there are only 25 true letters in the alphabet and his/her colleagues argue there are 26 and the first scientist is unswayed until an original transcript of the alphabet is presented before him or her, does the final realisation mean he/she believes EXACTLY what the other scientists do?  Of course not and to be without faith all your life and have one meeting with 'An Angel / God/ God's Messenger / Peter / Gabriel...take your pick' is like saying there's no heaven and then dying and standing on a cloud going 'Well, whaddaya know!'. Knowing your wrong and 'Getting the faith' aren't the same thing and the movie gets it wrong!In doing so they stuffed up what could have been a movie about faith and science worth seeing!",Null,0,3,28 August 1999
Goodfellas," Now THIS is a mafia movie!
","The Godfather may have told an interesting story of one family's hold on the mafia but nothing can touch the brilliance of Goodfellas. De Niro brought a surreal acceptance to his role that made him 'a made man!' and Joe Peschi just stole every scene with his motor mouth, (and people thought Eddie Murphy used the 'F' word alot!) which cracked me up throughout!I don't know what it is about him but PESCHI's tough guy talk makes me laugh and I have looked forward to his performances in everything since this classic introduced him to me.10/10.",Null,0,0,20 August 1999
