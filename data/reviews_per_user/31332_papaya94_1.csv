50 First Dates," I'm appalled
","Okay, Adam Sandler is adorable, and Drew Barry More's face could make you melt, but this movie was simply unexceptable.  Last night my friends and I went to the movies and I wanted to see Lost in Translation, however they complained that they didn't want to have to 'think', so instead I was forced to sit through a movie that made me fall apart in tears afterward.  My father died two years ago of severe brain damage.  The concept of having to woo some girl with short term memory loss every single day, and than eventually impregated her, and have her meet her child for time whenever she wakes up is just not funny.  I was so offended.  I mean 'ten second Tom', the fact that people find brain damage funny takes away all my hope in the human race.  I'm not just saying this because I'm a bitter teenager without a father, but I'm saying this because it's depressing that sick people and hermaphrodites are now the target of jokes and laughter.  It's sick. I hated his movie and whoever decided to make it should be ashamed of themselves.",Null,0,1,16 February 2004
