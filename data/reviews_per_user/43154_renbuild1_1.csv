Blade Runner 2049," I fell asleep and left halfway through
","If it weren't for the written clues at the beginning, I wouldn't have had the foggiest idea what was going on. Even so, the sound is so loud and the dialogue mumbled that the only character I could understand was Robin Wright. I'm not sure this is a spoiler, but it's impossible to tell whether there are only a handful of people or are they all robots (replicants)? If there are people, have they been moved to another planet? If so, why are any still here? If the new replicants are supposed to be so much more civil than the old ones, how do they get away with murder? For some unintelligible reason Tyrell (who is made up to look blind -- what's that all about???) kills a woman. Well, maybe he does say why, but he mumbles so much I couldn't say why he killed her. For some undeveloped and unexplained reason what the mystery is will 'kill society', so it has to be completely obliterated.This is slightly better than 'Arrival', though I did stay until the end of that bore. I may try it again when I can watch it with subtitles and can back it up to re-watch scenes that in a theater make no sense. If you MUST see it, get someone to tell you what's going on before you start.",2,5,10,18 October 2017
