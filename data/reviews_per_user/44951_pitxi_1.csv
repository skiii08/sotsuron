Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Masterpiece!!
","Tarantino's got style. No doubt about it. And has ideas very clear in his head. What a genius.Characters spread and fill the screen and catch you from the very first shot. Amazing performances, set ups, music, photography...Tatantino set an amazing world filled with bad guys and girl described with a superb poetry. The atmosphere is magic. Violence is presented as another piece as part of a perfect engaged machine. Dialogs are not as much present as previous T's movies, but they're far enough and works perfectly with the set up of the movie.Just say that Uma Thurman -the bride- overflows her talent in every single shot and reveal herself as a great great actress. And gorgeous.Real classic Cinema nowadays!!",9,4,8,3 April 2005
