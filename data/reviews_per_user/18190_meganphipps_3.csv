The Mask," One of Jim Carrey's Finest
","I LOVE THIS MOVIE. This was the movie that started my Jim Carrey craze. The effects were just amazing, Jim Carrey's performance was amazing and he always made you laugh and this film is my number one film of all time. I can't stop watching this film even to this day, if you want to have a laugh or want to see a great comedian at work then this is the film for you (I know it's mine). One of my favourite scenes of this movie is when he goes up against the bad guys and pretends to be shot as the Mask, Stanley Ipkiss is such a sweet and awesome character. It's one of Jim Carrey's finest films and I recommend it to anybody. I give this film a 10/10 and it's SMOKINNNNNNNNN.",10,0,0,8 August 2015
Toy Story," One of Pixar's greatest movies :)
","I LOVE TOY STORY. This film was part of my childhood when I was growing up, and it is still one of my favourite films to this day. The fact this was the first ever fully computer generated animation and is still popular to this day speaks for it's self. The characters are all unique in their own way and no matter what once you have watched this movie you will love for it ever (I know I do). One of my favourite moments has to be when we first meet Buzz Lightyear one of the most iconic scenes in any animation. If you like Disney movies or just generally like any animated movie then this is the movie for you. 'To infinity and beyond'.",10,0,1,12 August 2015
Bruce Almighty," Jim Carrey at his best!!
","I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I just recently watched this and it still makes me laugh and Jim Carrey as always does his very best. The film from start to finish was amazing as usual, the effects were awesome and the music to the film fit perfectly with what was going on and of course Morgan Freeman was amazing as god. One of my favourite characters has to be of course Bruce, he is funny and also he is such a genuine character. My favourite moment has to be when Bruce is walking along testing out god's powers and the song 'I Got The Power' comes on, funniest, moment ever in the film. If you like Jim Carrey or Morgan Freeman then this is the film just for you. 'He saw and it was good'.",10,2,2,24 August 2015
