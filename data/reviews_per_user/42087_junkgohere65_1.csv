Despicable Me 2," Laughed entire movie with kids
","We loved DM1, and loved DM2 as much if not more (more Minions means more laughs!!). My 8 and 10 year old's were all smiles pretty much the entire movie with the entire sold out crowd all in sync in the non stop laughter. I read a couple so-called 'movie reviewer's' slamming it. I don't know what movie they were watching but even Mom and I loved it too, awesome movie. The Minions steal the movie (sure this is of no surprise to anyone!). Carrell and Bridesmaid star Kirsten were great voices and were a great animation love story that unfolds in front of your eyes. Now the kids are going to drive us crazy to take them to see it again. DVD, early release please!",9,1,3,6 July 2013
