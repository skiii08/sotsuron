Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Real Disappointment
","After years of waiting, this is what we got -- and it's not of the best. Unfortunately, the pacing is bad, the dialogue is worse, the actors are at sea, and when it all comes down to brass tacks, you've got about 10 minutes of good filmmaking here (mainly the Duel of the Fates sequence at the end of the movie).  John Williams' music is great, as always, and the Queen Amidala costumes and makeup look stunning (as does the design for Darth Maul).  A major mistake is Lucas' resorting to dubious racial overtones for Jar Jar Binks and the Trade Federation, not to mention Watto.  Maybe it will seem better in the context of viewing all six Star Wars films in order, but one wonders.",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Maybe My Favorite Film Of All Time!
","A true modern classic. It's all been said before me -- Ford is perfect, Karen Allen (his best leading lady, hands down) is ideal, and the whole movie couldn't be changed one frame and still be as great as it is. For the nitpickers: Look for a tiny Indy hanging on to the periscope of the U-boat (U-boats couldn't entirely submerge, they had to keep at least an airpipe above water at all times for ventilation).This lovingly crafted tribute to the great Saturday afternoon serials of the 1930s-1950s is full of fun, gritty action (Indiana Jones fights dirtier than any of his opponents -- he uses *every trick in the book!*), Americana, deathtraps and cliffhangers, and real Hollywood magic. Add to that the awe-inspiring musical score (better, ahem, than STAR WARS'), the eminently quotable dialogue ('You Americans, you are always the same -- always overdressing for the wrong occasions'), and that this is Ford's best role ever, and you have a must-see movie. If you haven't seen ROTLA, see it now! Right now! Me, I think I'll go watch it again. About 40 times in the theater, who knows how often on the small screen -- and it's still as great as ever!",10,2,4,25 January 2006
The Fifth Element," Only the French Could Have Made This Film
","There's something about French SF -- it's got that whole 'Metal Hurlant,' a-bit-overripe-and-a-bit-too-earnest-and-silly feel (these things really need Jean 'Moebius' Giraud to steer them, or Truffaut, if he weren't dead). The hammy and overrated Gary Oldman plays his usual cheeseball villain in a collection of affected mannerisms and expressions, while Willis' hero (well, sort of) falls into one weird (but pretty) situation after another.  In its favor, the movie gives you a whole other world of imagination.  In its disfavor, the world it shows you makes little sense and is a bit over-designed.  Usual 'chosen-one-must-save-the-world' plot we've been forced to watch in SF and fantasy for the past 25 years (can you say 'pyrotechnic special effects finale?'); tune out the plot and dialogue but stay for the cool designs (and the funny-looking ones, too)!",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
X-Men," Marvel Finally Has A Hit
","After years of watching DC Comics' characters get good movies, Marvel finally scores one for their recognizable superheroes.  As an anti-fan of the mutant hero phenomenon, I was pleasantly surprised to find that apart from the expected great work of Patrick Stewart and Ian MacKellan there were also standout performances in the roles of Wolverine and Rogue.  They turned my least favorite X-characters into my favorite ones (for the span of one movie, anyway).  Of course, there's much to be said for their costume and makeup designers' work on the Mystique character, but that's not for a family Web site...",Null,0,0,18 March 2002
The Exorcist," You Really Have To Fear The Devil To Find This Scary
","Because if you don't, it alternates boredom with over-the-top attempts at shocking you.  Good makeup from Dick Smith and good work from the cinematographer don't save THE EXORCIST from being just kinda silly.  My brothers and I laughed at it when we first saw it, and I still can't take it seriously.  The subliminal effects don't exactly work, either.",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," You Thought They Didn't Make This Kind of Movie Anymore...
","Ignore what others may say -- this is a worthy successor to the Rankin-Bass puppet-animated holiday classics of your childhood, merged with the darkly whimsical sensibilities of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman.  Everything about it is charming, from the character design to the lovely and haunting tunes (it's an animated musical about two great holidays -- Hallowe'en and Christmas).  Run, don't walk, to your video store to rent it!",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
The Matrix," Pretty... Vacant
","It all looks so good, and the music is so cool, that you almost forget that it's a tissue paper-thin story with a religious parallel message you could choke a Tibetan yak with.  Best lines in the movie:  'I know kung fu,' and 'Whoa.'  Take both pills!",Null,0,0,18 March 2002
