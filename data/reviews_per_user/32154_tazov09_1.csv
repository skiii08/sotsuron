Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Excellent film!
","This film was amazing, still keeping the traditional sherlock Holmes characters and personalities while making an exciting thrill ride! Highly recommended! Saw with the whole family and we all loved it, the ending and beginning where amazing, and their was humor the whole way through, definitely go to see this! Downey JR and Jude Law are great actors and really portray the parts really well. One of my favorite films ever! Better than the first! Glad it wasn't in 3D as that would have ruined the experience, the whole feel of the film is of excitement and light hearted humor while keeping the hard set story line based on the original Conan Doyle books!",10,1,3,31 January 2012
