Saturday Night Fever," An Excellent And Unforgettable Classic With A Brilliant Performance by John Travolta.
","Saturday Night Fever is an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines wonderful direction,an amazing star-making performance by John Travolta and a great cast,a classic soundtrack and a memorable score. All of those elements make Saturday Night Fever a classic and one of the best films of the 1970s.Set in Brooklyn,New York,Saturday Night Fever tells the story of Tony Manero(John Travolta),a young teenager who goes to the local Disco club every Saturday night with his friends to dance where Tony is king of the dance floor but outside of the dance club his life is miserable. When Tony meets and befriends fellow dancer Stephanie(Karen Lynn Gorney),Tony starts to re-examine his life and decides to grow up.Released in 1977,Saturday Night Fever is a brilliant,unforgettable and iconic film that was not only a critical and Box Office success but also made John Travolta a movie star,helped launch the Disco craze in the late 1970s and gave viewers one of the best and biggest soundtracks of all-time. It's a movie that has become so famous and apart of Pop Culture you know the film by the title name,the white suit that Travolta wears in the movie or by it's many songs on the soundtrack that are played throughout the film and are still played on the radio. Right from the now iconic opening scene,Saturday Night Fever is an instant classic from the very moment you watch an amazing film that is just an experience that glues viewers to the screen with music,intense drama and electricity that just never stops. When you watch Saturday Night Fever it's truly like watching a time capsule that takes viewers back to the 70s and 1977 in New York showing the night and day-to-day life in New York during that decade. While Saturday Night Fever isn't a musical where characters are singing and dancing,the music and dancing play a big part in the film with the music making certain scenes come alive while the dance scenes are amazing,memorable and are done in a visual stunning style that is dream like and beautiful with tons of energy that makes the film. What I also love about SNF is that despite the music and dancing the movie at it's heart is a timeless Coming Of Age story and is one of the best in the genre showing viewers the Coming Of Age of Tony Manero. The character Tony Manero is a classic character of 1970s cinema and the Coming Of Age genre because while he isn't the most likable person and can be a jerk at times we see Tony deal with the hardships of growing up. When Tony is dancing at the night club he is the king on the dance floor but outside of the night club Tony's life is a wreck and is pretty sad,he works a dead end job at the hardware store and his parents think less of him and see Tony going nowhere in life. Despite Tony's miserable life he's very ambitious and wants to succeed in life beyond his neighborhood which makes the character Tony truly complex. What also makes Tony grow is when he meets Stephanie who Tony sees as a prime example making it and being successful which gives Tony more hope for his future. When Tony and Stephanie begin to dance together and start to know one another they both need each other and start to relate to one another more and try to help each other out. Tony Manero is a memorable and interesting character you will never forget and is one of the reasons the movie is a classic. There are also parts in SNF that make the movie dark,bleak and gritty because like Tony the other characters have sad and miserable lives and the movie has a tragic overtone that sticks with you. The movie also deals with themes such as sex and aimless youth who are lost in the haze of trying not to think about about real life. SNF is a much deeper movie than one might think and isn't just a movie about Disco and dancing and that's one of the reasons it's a great film. The ending of Saturday Night Fever is amazing and powerful and truly brings the character Tony full circle and we as the audience feel that there is hope for this character. A terrific ending.The cast is great. John Travolta is excellent and iconic as Tony Manero,with Travolta bringing charisma and depth to the role. Karen Lynn Gorney is wonderful as Stephanie Tony's love interest and dance partner. Barry Miller(Bobby C.),Joseph Cali(Joey),Paul Pape(Double J.)and Bruce Ornstein(Gus)do fantastic jobs as Tony's friends. Donna Pescow is great as Annette,a neighborhood girl who's in love with Tony. Martin Shakar is sensational as Father Frank Manero Jr.,Tony's older brother who's a priest. Val Bisoglio(Frank Sr.),Julie Bovasso(Flo Manero),Sam J. Coppola(Fusco)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by Fran Drescher in the role as Connie.The direction by John Badham is terrific and stylish,with Badham always moving the camera and bringing a beautiful and visually stunning look to the film with fine camera angles and use of color and lighting. Great direction,Badham.The score by David Shire is fantastic,memorable and matches the tone of the film. Wonderful score,Shire. The soundtrack from The Bee Gees one of the best and most iconic soundtracks of all-time with songs by The Bee Gees(Staying Alive,More Than A Woman,How Deep Is Your Love,Night Fever,You Should Be Dancing),Yvonne Elliman(If I Can't Have You),K.C & The Sunshine Band(Boogie Shoes),The Trammps(Disco Inferno),Walter Murphy(A Fifth Of Beethoven). A classic soundtrack.In final word,if you love 1970s films,cinema in general,John Travolta and Music,I Highly Suggest you see Saturday Night Fever,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you will never forget and watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,1,18 March 2015
Scarface," An Excellent,Unforgettable,Epic And Stylish Gangster Classic From Brian De Palma With A Brilliant Performance From Al Pacino.
","Scarface is an excellent,unforgettable and stylish epic Gangster film that combines amazing direction,a brilliant,iconic performance by Al Pacino as well as great performances from the rest of the cast,a terrific script and a great score and soundtrack. All of those elements make Scarface not only a Gangster classic,but also a Cult classic and a amazing remake that is Brian De Palma and Al Pacino at their best.Set in Miami,Florida in the early 1980s,Scarface tells the story of Tony Montana(Al Pacino),a Cuban immigrant who has arrived in the United States wanting success and the pursuit of the American dream. While in the city of Miami,Tony joins a drug cartel rising in the ranks and becoming one of the top suppliers of Cocaine while gaining money and power. Although successful and wealthy,Tony starts using his own coke supply and starts becoming paranoid,erratic and out of control leading to Tony's downfall for himself and the people around him.Released in 1983,Scarface while a modest success at the Box Office was panned by nearly every major critic in America at the time because of the film's Graphic Violence and excessive language. But since it's 1983 release Scarface has become a Cult Film and one of the most iconic films of all time with Scarface and Tony Montana becoming icons in not just pop culture but also Hip-Hop culture where Hip-Hop and Rap artists truly worship the film. Scarface is one of the all time great epic Gangster movies and is an amazing film on so many levels because what director Brian De Palma does is take Howard Hawks' original Gangster Classic Scarface(1932)and takes it from the world of Prohibition in the 1920s to the world drug infested world of early 1980s Miami,Florida pulling viewers into a world that is filled with excess and money with over the top style and brilliance that keeps you glued to the screen even though the world of Scarface is dangerous and violent. Scarface is also a film about the pursuit of the American Dream but the American Dream is done in a flashy style with the main characters surround by drugs,money and death in this film with the American Dream told in a dark tale of tragedy,violence and downfall. Brian De Palma tricks viewers by showing the glitz and glamor of the Gangster and drug world of Scarface but then shows viewers how vicious and dark the drug world really is. At it's core Scarface is a morality tale told a Shakespeare way about the choices a person can make in life and how it can affect not only yourself but others as well and it definitely applies to Tony Montana. Tony Montana is one of the greatest and most iconic characters is movie history and a character who's been imitated and quoted throughout pop culture and is also a classic antihero who wants the world and everything in it no matter what. Tony is a complex character who we like not because of the things that he does but because of who he is because Tony has his own rules and codes that he lives by and never breaking them. We also see two different sides of Tony before and after his success which shows us his rise and fall. Before his success,Tony's head is on straight and he's more optimistic on the rise but as Tony becomes more successful with money and power Tony becomes more paranoid and distrusting with not only himself but with the people around him which leads to his unfortunate fall acting like a bomb about to go off. The rise and fall of Tony Montana is one of the most compelling and tragic rise and fall tales you will ever see on film. The violence in Scarface is Graphic,shocking and will disturb viewers because of it's darkness and brutality but I think the violence had to be in the film because it shows how dangerous and harsh the drug world can be. The screenplay by Oliver Stone is amazing and memorable with so many great lines and lots of F-bombs. Some of the dialog by Stone has become so iconic and unforgettable and are staples in pop culture especially the film's most famous line that comes at the end. The ending of Scarface is easily one of the greatest endings I have ever seen on film because there is thrills,great lines,violence and surprises adding to the legend of Scarface and Tony Montana. An amazing conclusion to a great film.The whole cast is terrific. Al Pacino is excellent,iconic and at his best as Tony Montana,with Pacino being intense,over the top and unforgettable. Amazing performance by Pacino. Steven Bauer is fantastic as Manny,Tony's best friend and right hand man. Michelle Pheiffer is amazing and sexy as Elvira,Frank's girlfriend and Tony's love interest. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is terrific as Gina Montana,Tony's sister. Robert Loggia is outstanding and memorable as Frank Lopez,Tony's boss. F.Murray Abraham is wonderful as Omar,an employee of Frank's. Paul Shener is sensational as Sosa,a business partner of Tony's. Harris Yulan is wonderful as Mel Bernstein,a corrupt cop. Miriam Colem is captivating as Mama Montana,Tony and Gina's Mother.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera with close-ups,zoom ins bringing his signature style to the film. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Giorgio Moroder is amazing,memorable and matches the film's tone. Fantastic score,Moroder. The film also has wonderful soundtrack with songs by Paul Engemann(Push It To The Limit),Deborah Harry(Rush Rush),Amy Holland(She's On Fire,Turn Out The Night),Elizabeth Daily(Shake It Up,I'm Hot Tonight),Beth Andersen(Dance,Dance,Dance),Maria Conchita Alonso(Vamos a Bailar)and Frank Sinatra(Strangers In The Night). Incredible soundtrack.In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Cult Films,Brian De Palma,Al Pacino or movies in general,I highly suggest you watch Scarface,an excellent,unforgettable epic Gangster Classic that is Brian De Palma and Al Pacino at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,2,20 November 2013
The Big Lebowski," A Brilliant,Hilarious Cult Classic Comedy. The Coen Brothers At Their Best.
","The Big Lebowski is an brilliant,hilarious,funny Comedy and a true Cult classic. Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,fantastic script,memorable characters and a fantastic soundtrack,The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest films of all time and The Coen Brothers at their best.Set in Los Angeles,California in the early 1990s,The Big Lebowski tells the story of Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski(Jeff Bridges),a stoner from the 1960s who loves getting stoned,Bowling,white Russians,his carpet rug and Creedance Clearwater Revival and lives a pretty normal life. Then one night The Dude is attacked by two thugs who mistake The Dude for millionaire Jeff Lebowski(David Huddleson)and urinate on The Dude's rug. This case of mistaken identity puts The Dude in a tale of intrigue and Mystery where he meets various characters and laughs and chaos Ensue.The Big Lebowski is one of the best Comedies of all time and is a hilarious film from beginning to end that didn't get much attention at the time. The Big Lebowski came out two years after The Coen Brothers Masterpiece Fargo which was critically acclaimed and won many movie awards and then after The Coen Brothers did Fargo they released The Big Lebowski,which did modest business at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics,most critics seeing The Big Lebowski as a failure compared to Fargo. But since it's release in 1998,The Big Lebowski has become a one of the all time great Cult Films,one of the funniest movies of all time and is now seen as a classic from critics and audiences and one of The Coen Brothers best films. One of the reasons The Big Lebowski is such great movie is that The Coen Brothers have taken the taken the Film-Noir style and influence of Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep(film and novel)and set in Los Angeles in the early 1990s where instead of long coats and a tough detective it's long hair and a stoner. The Comedy and Humor in this film is hilarious and it mostly based on the situations and dialog and the various characters that The Dude meets or comes in contact with and each character The Dude meets gets weirder and stranger and each character that comes in contact with The Dude is unpredictable and surprising. TBL has a Film-Noir influence because the film has intrigue and Mystery but in TBL the intrigue and Mystery is slightly off kilter and it seems like every character in the film including The Dude is messed up in the head and you never know what's going to happen next. It's Film-Noir told from a Stoner's point of view and it's ingenious and original. TBL also has episodic feel to it where the film and it's characters go from one thing to the next and the plot is complex but not hard to understand and it adds to the great outlandish and hilarious tone of the film. The photography by Roger Deakins is beautiful and Surreal and colorful making the Los Angeles city and landscape look amazing and bright and adds to the film's comic tone and greatness. Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is one of the most iconic characters in the history of film because as soon as comes on the screen The Dude has this great presence and style and you just never forget him. What's also great about The Dude is that he is a slacker and stoner and doesn't care who knows about it and The Dude has a down to earth style all of his own and he doesn't try to be cool he just is. Although not a Private Detective in the traditional sense like Phillip Marrlow or Sam Spade,The Dude evokes the same style as those two great characters as investigates and tries to solve a mystery and the way The Dude deals with characters whether it's his friends or other characters is funny and classic. The Dude is a character that will be remembered forever. The screenplay Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and well-written with every main character saying hilarious lines and dialog that very quotable and memorable. The ending of the film is funny,tragic and ironic and is a truly classic Coen Brothers ending that adds to the greatness of The Big Lebowski.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Jeff Bridges is excellent and hilarious in his most iconic role as Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski,with Bridges bringing laughs and coolness to the role. John Goodman is brilliant and hilarious as Walter,a Vietnam veteran,who's The Dude's best friend and bowling teammate and Goodman has great scenes and chemistry with Bridges. Julianne Moore is great as Maude Lebowski,a painter and the big Lebowski's daughter. Steve Buscemi is wonderful as Donny,The Dude and Walter's bowling teammate. David Huddleston is fantastic as Jeff Lebowski,The Big Lebowski. John Turturro is excellent and funny in his small role as Jesus Quintana,a sex offender and rival Bowler of The Dude and Walter. Phillip Seymour Hoffman(Brandnt),Sam Elliot(The Stranger,narrator),Ben Gazzara(Jackie Treehorn),Jon Polito(Da Fino),Tara Reid(Bunny Lebowski),Peter Stormare(Nihilist#1 Uli),Flea(Nihilist#2,Kiefer)and Torsten Voges(Nihilist#3,Franz)give good performances as well. The direction by The Coen Brothers is excellent and stylish,with The Coens using slow camera movements,close ups and zooms and beautiful lighting and visual style. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is great,fun and ominous and it fits the tone of film. A wonderful score from Burwell. The soundtrack also has songs from Bob Dylan(The Man In Me),Kenny Rogers And The First Edition(I Just Dropped In(To What Condition My Conditon Was In),Creedance Clearwater Revival(Looking Out My Back Door,Run Through The Jungle),The Eagles(Peaceful Easy Feeling),Santana(Oyc Como Va),Townes Van Zandt(Dead Flowers),Big Johnson(Viva Las Vegas),Nina Simone(I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good),Sons Of The Pioneers(Tumbling Tumbleweeds)and more. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies,Cult Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Big Lebowski,a brilliant and hilarious Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,1,26 June 2013
Inglourious Basterds," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made And One Of The Greatest War Films Ever Made. A Tarantino Masterpiece.
","Inglorious Bastards is one of the greatest films ever made that combines excellent direction,brilliant acting,a great screenplay,amazing Action,wonderful soundtrack and black humor. It is one of my favorite movies,a classic war film and a Tarantino Masterpiece.Set in France in the 1940s during World War II,Inglorious Bastards tells the story of a secret army known as The Bastards,a group of Jewish soldiers led by LT. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt)who hunt,capture,kill and scalp Nazi soldiers. And while The Bastards hunt Nazi soldiers they soon have to deal with Nazi detective Hans Landa(Christoph Waltz)who is nicknamed 'The Jew Hunter'. Meanwhile,young Jewish girl Shoshanna Dreyfus(Melanie Laurant)who owns a local theater wants revenge on the Nazi when the Nazi wants to show one of their films at her theater. The tension builds up to a conclusion that Aldo Raine,The Bastards,Hans Landa or Shoshanna Dreyfus will never forget.Inglorious Bastards is a masterpiece of cinema that will have you mesmerized and glued to the screen,a big and epic War film that is brutal,intense,violent and funny. With Bastards,Quentin Tarantino takes the genre of the Spaghetti Western and applies it to the World War II backdrop and gives viewers not a realistic world,but a Tarantino world where everything is bigger than life and everything is exaggerated beyond belief. Tarantino has never made a conventional film or has never played by the rules and IB is as about as unconventional as it gets because with IB Tarantino gives viewers a WWII film unlike we have never seen before where Tarantino boldly rewrites history and real life characters without a problem and in it's own way makes the revisionist history believable. Tarantino also fills the film with lots of anachronisms using songs and music scores that are not from the 1940s but are from later in the 20th century,it seems like a risky move but songs fit in well with the scenes in the film and you never ask about realism and accuracy. The Screenplay by Tarantino is excellent and unforgettable,with Tarantino giving each of the characters in the film great dialog that's funny and humorous and delightfully over the top. The dialog in the film is very memorable and well-written it stays with you for a days and you will quote lines from the film again and again. The pace of the film is amazing because even though the film is 152 minutes at times it feels like it's 90 minutes thanks to the dialog from Tarantino and editing by Sally Menke making the film go by smoothly and making IB one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever watch. The three main characters in the film Aldo Raine,Hans Landa and Shoshanna Dreyfus are classic Tarantino characters who are very memorable in their own way. The two characters Aldo and Hans are both mirrors of each other in some ways because while Aldo hunts down Nazis and Hans hunts the Jews both characters use similar tactics such as talk,smarts and cleverness to do their job. Both are dangerous and great at what they do. Characters and revenge is a common theme in most of Tarantino's film and Shoshanna Dreyfus is another character looking for revenge. With Shoshanna you feel her rage and anger because of what the Nazis have done to her people and when you see Shoshanna you can relate to her and wanting to have revenge. These are three classic Tarantino characters that will stick with you after watching the film. The violence and Action scenes in the film are done with brilliance and style because every Action done with an air of suspense and great build up and when build up stops and when the Action comes it's like an explosion. This film also has one of the best shootouts in film history and when it happens it will be like someone punched you in the face. The ending of IB is classic Tarantino and it is so powerful that you will be in awe at it's intensity and brilliance and it is truly an ending that you have to see and believe. It's a great explosive ending and is one of the reasons Inglorious Bastards is a masterpiece.The whole cast does an excellent job in their roles. Brad Pitt is excellent as LT. Aldo Raine,with Pitt bringing humor and over the top greatness to the role. Christoph Waltz won a Oscar for his brilliant and masterful performance as Hans Landa,one of the best villains in film history. Waltz is menacing,powerful,terrifying and unforgettable in his role. Great performance. Melanie Laurent is wonderful and sexy as Shoshanna Dreyfus,with Laurent bringing intensity and depth to the role. Eli Roth is funny and tough as Donny Donowitz,nicknamed 'The Bear Jew. Michael Fessbender is great as LT. Archie Hicox,a British soldier who works with The Bastards. Diane Kruger is fantastic as Bridget Von Hammersmark,a double agent working with The Bastards. Daniel Bruhl is great as Freddrick Zoller,a German war hero who likes Shosanna. Til Schweiger is tough and intense as Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz,a German soldier killer who helps The Bastards. August Dieli is wonderful in his role as German soldier Major Hellstrom. Gedeon Burkhard is smooth and cool as Cpt. Wilhelm Wicki. Martin Wuttke(Hitler)and Sylvester Groth(Joseph Goebbels)give fun and over the top performances. Mike Myers(Gen. Ed Fenech),B.J Novak(Pfc. Utivich),Jacky Ido(Mercel),Rod Taylor(Winston Churchill),Julie Dreyfus(Francesca),Omar Doom(Pfc. Omar)and Denis Menochet(Perrier LaPadite)give good performances too.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is excellent,with Tarantino bringing a beautiful and gritty cinematic style to the film and moving the camera at all costs when needed. Great direction by Tarantino.I love music that is used in this film which is mostly composed songs from Ennio Morricone and other composers. I also loved the use of the song Cat People from David Bowie. Great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Inglorious Bastards,an epic Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,4,10 May 2013

The real life actors playing themselves in this movie is ingenious showing viewers actors in the film and how in a fictional way how they would act if the end of the world did happen and it's done in a wild and unforgettable way. The Apocalypse in the film is played with laughs but is also done in a straight forward manner thanks to the actors so the film doesn't become a Spoof or a Parody but the laughs are always there. The screenplay by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg is excellent and well-written with lines of memorable dialog that is very funny,profane and vulgar and with great moments of creativity and style as well writing in hilarious scenes that reference some of the main actors films which include Pineapple Express as well as funny and over the top references to Horror classics such as The Exorcist and the film Rosemary's Baby.

What's also great about SOTD is that there are moments that are played in a straight forward manner so the film doesn't become a Spoof or Parody. Although SOTD is a Comedy it never forgets that it's a Horror film as well because there is a few moments where the movie can be suspenseful and intense and can make you jump out of your seat. The main character is an amazing character because he is an unlikely hero that would be able to deal with trying to help his friends and loved ones survive the Zombie Apocalypse with all of the problems he's having in his personal life. As the film goes on we see Shaun start to grow as a leader and man and it's done in a funny and some times serious way with great character development that isn't always seen in Zombie films and you root for Shaun to succeed. The Zombies in SOTD are wonderful and are influenced by George A. Romero's films because like in Romero's film's they look like regular people you see on the street.

","12 Angry Men is one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent and unforgettable Classic from Sidney Lumet that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic score making 12 Angry Men one of my favorite films,Sidney Lumet at his best and cinema at it's best.Set in New York City,12 Angry Men tells the story of 12 jurors who have to decide the fate of a young boy who's been accused of murdering his Father. While the 11 other jurors think the boy's guilty and the case is open and shut,one juror,juror#8(Henry Fonda)Isn't so sure and think they should discuss the case and change the other jurors including juror#3(Lee J. Cobb)verdicts and convince the jurors that the boy is not guilty.12 Angry Men is a brilliant classic that marked the directorial debut of director Sidney Lumet and also gave viewers one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made. What separates 12 Angry Men from other courtroom dramas is the setting because where other Courtroom dramas take place in and out of the courtroom,12 Angry en takes place mostly inside of a jury room. Right from the moment when the characters enter the jury room viewers are given an riveting and powerful film that has no gunfights,explosions,fist fights or car chases but is one of the most intense and emotionally charged films of all time. When you watch 12 Angry Men you are in the minds of the 12 jurors who are making a choice about a persons life whether they decide that the young boy is guilty or not testing our thoughts and what would we do if we were in a situation like that. 12 Angry Men not only succeeds as a court room drama but as a character study as well because as we watch the film and see all 12 of the jurors we see who they really are outside of the jury room bringing their personal feelings about who they are whether it's about the case or how they feel about each other and the characters are well-developed and interesting. The film also deals with themes such as racism and prejudice in a intelligent and thoughtful way that is still powerful and relevant. Another thing I love about 12 Angry Men is the visually stunning photography and atmosphere. Boris Kaufman's black and white photography is beautiful and haunting adding to the movie's intensity and as emotions run high the photography becomes more dreary and dark. I also love the fact that most of the movie takes place in one room which gives the movie a claustrophobic feel and as 12 Angry Men keeps going the room becomes more enclosed and isolated where you feel like the characters will never get out. Also,the fact that 12 Angry Men takes place on a hot and humid day adds to the tension of the main characters because the jurors are not angry just because of the decision they have to make as jurors but also the heat. When you watch this film you will feel the heat coming of the screen. All the jurors are great characters but the two who are the most fascinating are jurors number#8 and #3 because both pretty much represent the voices of the film. Juror #8 Isn't convinced that the boy is guilty wanting to talk to the other jurors and convince them by asking questions and making a case. You will root and relate to juror#8 because of his determination and persistence that never stops. Where as juror#8 thinks the boy Isn't guilty,juror#3 is convinced right away that the boy is guilty from the start not just because of the facts presented in the case but because of the things going on in his personal life that affects his decision and when the other jurors are talking about the case juror #3 explodes with anger and rage not understanding why would they continue with this case. Juror#8 and #3 are classic and unforgettable characters who anchor the film and have a complexity that adds to the film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose is terrific,with Rose giving the characters memorable dialog as well as scenes that are amazing and will stick with viewers. The ending of 12 Angry Men is fantastic and in my opinion one of the best endings in movie history with non-stop greatness and intensity that you will never forget. A powerful and outstanding conclusion.The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Henry Fonda is excellent and at his best as Juror#8,with Fonda bringing depth and a heroic quality to the role. Lee J. Cobb is brilliant and fiery in one of my favorite performances in film history as Juror#3,with Cobb bringing intensity,anger and complexity to the role and having great scenes with Fonda. E.G Marshall is terrific as Juror#4,an intelligent stockbroker. Joseph Sweeney is wonderful as Juror#9,an observant and elderly juror. Ed Begley is riveting as Juror#10,a man full of racism,hate and prejudice. Jack Warden is outstanding as Juror#7,with Warden bringing humor to the film. Jack Klugman is fantastic as Juror#12,a man with a slum background. George Voskovic is sensational as Juror#11,a European Juror. John Fiedler(Juror#2),Martin Balsam(Juror#1,The Foreman),Robert Webber(Juror#12)and Edward Binns(Juror#6)give great performances as well. The direction by Sidney Lumet is amazing and stylish,with Lumet constantly moving the camera and showing close-ups,over head shots keeping the film moving at an incredible pace with a wonderful visual style. Terrific direction,Lumet. The score Kenyon Hopkins is great,memorable and intense and matches the film's tone. Amazing score,Hopkins.In final word,if you love Sidney Lumet,Henry Fonda,Courtroom Dramas or cinema,I highly suggest you see 12 Angry Men,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,2,18 January 2014
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," An Excellent,Hilarious,Underrated Romantic Comedy-Drama.
","Crazy,Stupid,Love is an excellent,hilarious,underrated Romantic Comedy-Drama that combines solid direction,a wonderful cast,terrific laughs,a great script and a memorable score. All of those elements make Crazy,Stupid,Love a fantastic and entertaining Comedy-Drama that is worth the time.Set in Los Angeles,California,Crazy,Stupid,Love tells the story of Cal(Steve Carell),a man who's wife and High School sweetheart Emily(Julianne Moore)wants a divorce. Heartbroken and emotionally scarred,Cal receives advice from Jacob(Ryan Gosling),a smooth talking ladies man who that not only becomes Cal's friend but also teaches Cal to and to pick up woman at the clubs and bars and become a new Cal that is more confident and self-assured.Most would agree that Romantic Comedies,while successful at the Box Office are predictable,sentimental and sappy but every once in a while there is a gem or a diamond in the rough to be found in the Romantic Comedy genre that stands out from the crowd and gives viewers a fresh take on the genre and one of those gems and diamonds in the rough is Crazy,Stupid,Love,a wonderful,hilarious and truly bittersweet Romantic Comedy-Drama that was a Box Office success but was overlooked because most people thought is was going to be another Romantic Comedy but the film is very underrated and is one of the best and better films of the Romantic Comedy genre. Crazy,Stupid,Love is a great movie that seems like from it's title is going to be a typical run-of-the-mill Rom-Com but the movie gives viewers something that is a little different from the norm and showing us a film that is very funny and heartfelt as well as fascinating and observant about love,romance and relationships because in Crazy,Stupid,Love themes of love,romance and relationships can come in all shapes and sizes with an hilarious and very interesting look at concepts and subjects such as failing relationships,beginning romances and unrequited love that effects people of all ages. This is a movie that just keeps you glued to the screen and will give viewers many emotions and feelings such as laughter,sadness and heartbreak while telling viewers to have a good time with this bittersweet tale of love and romance. The Comedy and Humor in CSL is funny and amusing and does a fantastic job striking a balance between going over the top and playing it straight because there is moments throughout the film that will make you laugh out loud while there are funny scenes that are more subtle. What also makes CSL funny is how unpredictable it can be at times and the twists and turns you won't see coming at all. The movie not only gives viewers the main plot involving Cal and Jacob but subplots involving other characters a subplot involving Jacob falling for working girl Hanna(Emma Stone)and another subplot about Cal's young son Robbie(Jonah Bobo)who's in love with his babysitter Jessica(Analeigh Tipton)who in turn has a crush on Cal. The many story lines and plots all mesh together well in CSL and there is not a wasted scene in the entire film. What I also enjoy about CSL is that the film is not afraid to be a little serious and dramatic especially with some of the characters giving them depth and tons of weight which makes the characters real and sympathetic while at the same time being over the top. The screenplay by Dan Fogelman is terrific and well-written,with Fogelman giving each of the main characters great dialog that is funny and interesting with many memorable scenes. The ending of Crazy,Stupid,Love is wonderful and a good cap-off to the film although some will find it predictable and obvious because of the genre and it's conventions but I like the ending. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is great. Steve Carell is excellent and hilarious as Cal,with Carell being funny and serious. Ryan Gosling is brilliant and funny as Jacob,with Gosling being cool and charismatic. Julianne Moore is wonderful as Emily,Cal's wife. Emma Stone is terrific as Hannah,Jacob's love interest. Analeigh Tipton is amusing as Jessica,a babysitter who has a crush on Cal. Jonah Bobo does a fine job as Robbie,Cal's son who's in love with Jessica. Kevin Bacon(David Lindhagen)and Marisa Tomei(Kate)are fun and memorable in their small roles. Beth Littleford(Claire),John Carroll Lynch(Bernie),Liz Lapira(Liz),Julianna Guill(Madison),Josh Groban(Richard)and Joey King(Molly)give good performances as well.The direction by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa is great,with Ficarra and Requa always moving the camera and giving the film and nice tone and visual style. Wonderful direction,Ficarra and Requa.The score by Christope Black and Nick Urata is fantastic,quirky and matches the bright tone of the movie. Fine score Black and Urata.In final word,if you love Romantic Comedies or Comedies in general,I highly suggest you Crazy,Stupid,Love,an excellent,hilarious and underrated Romantic Comedy that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,2,4 March 2015
Superbad," An Brilliant And Hilarious Teen Film. A Modern Comedy Classic From The Judd Apatow Group.
","Superbad is an hilarious Teen film and a modern Comedy classic. An amazing mixture of great laughs,great direction,a wonderful cast and a hilarious script,Superbad is my favorite Judd Apatow film and easily one Apatow's best films.Superbad tells the story of teenagers Seth(Jonah Hill)and Evan(Michael Cera),two High School seniors and best friends who are on the verge of graduation who are invited to a High School party and have to get beer and alcohol. With the help of their friend Fogell(Christopher Mintz-Plasse),Seth and Evan have to deal with growing apart,dating their High School crushes and getting into hilarious and bizarre situations in one crazy night.Superbad is a brilliant and funny laugh a minute Teen Comedy that is an instant classic from the moment you watch,an hilarious Comedy that follows the great,grand tradition of other great Teen films like American Grafititi and Dazed And Confused taking the laughs and heart of those two films and mixing them with ingenious laughs of Animal House. The first five minutes of Superbad set the tone for the rest of the film where in Superbad there are jokes and laughs that are just non-stop and like many of Judd Apatow's films mixes raunchy Humor and wild,over the top characters with honesty and great depth. The great laughs and moments in the film are driven by the characters and their dialog which are in the real world but the characters and dialog is so wild and over the top you would think that Superbad took in an alternate reality that is very stylized and any that can happen will happen. Although the film has a lot of Comedic dialog,Superbad also has a lot of Slapstick and physical Comedy that is done so well that the great Slapstick Comedy will have you in tears because of the absurdity and wild crazy insanity of each moment. Superbad is great Teen film because like some of the best Teen films the characters while over the top are real and seem like true and accurate depictions of Teenagers and the dialog which is how Teens talk and even though there is sexual related dialog and some sexual activity there is no nudity in the film. Another reason Superbad is great Teen film is that there are no typical Teen movie conventions in the film,there are no popular and evil Stock Teen movie characters such as Jocks,Cheerleaders or other Teen stereotypes in the film because Superbad is told from the outcasts P.O.V. I'm so glad most of the typical Teenage conventions are pretty much gone,not mentioned and nonexistent. What I also love about Superbad is that this film takes place during the course of one day and night because when a film is set during one day anything can happen in one day that can change a persons life and in this film the things and events that happen in this film wild,funny,unpredictable and very surprising. The screenplay by Seth Rogan(who also co-stars in the film)and Evan Goldberg is fantastic and well-written and has memorable dialog that will be quoted for years. The three main Superbad characters Seth,Evan and Fogell are great Teen characters we can relate to because when we watch the film we feel we knew the main characters in High School because they are outcasts who don't necessarily want to be popular but just want to date their crushes and be liked before their High School days end. All three characters do wild and crazy things but they are likable and have multiple-dimensions that make them rise above who and what they are. At 114 minutes the film Superbad moves at a great pace and the film has a wonderful energy that never slows until the end and you are glued to the screen because you never want the film to stop. The ending of Superbad is funny, wonderful and sad because when you watch the film you going to wonder what will happen to the characters Seth and Evan and Superbad leaves the viewer with a lot of questions. A great ending.The whole cast does excellent jobs in their roles. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are brilliant and hilarious as Seth and Evan,with Hill and Cera bringing laughs,depth and great chemistry. Christopher Mintz-Plasse(in his film debut)gives a funny and excellent performance as Fogell AKA McLovin,Seth and Evan's friend. Bill Hader(Officer Slater) and Seth Rogan(Officer Michaels)are funny,delightful and over the top as the cops who have fun with Fogell. Emma Stone(Jules)and Martha MacIsassc(Becca)are fantastic and beautiful in their roles as Seth and Evan's love interests. Aviva(Nicole),Joe Lo Truglio(Francis The Driver),Kevin Corrigan(Mark)and Clement E. Blake(Homeless Guy)give fun performances as well.The direction by Greg Mottola is wonderful,with Mottola always moving the camera and giving the film a great energy and visual style. Great job,Mottola.The score by Lyle Workman is great and memorable and reminds me of the scores from the 1970s. A fine score by Workman. The soundtrack also has great songs by The Bar Kays(Too Hot To Stop,Soul Finger),Rick James(Bustin' Out(On Funk),The Four Tops(Are You Man Enough),Ted Nugent(Stranglehold),Van Halen(Panama),Curtis Mayfield(P.S I Love You),The Notorious B.I.G(Big Poppa),Motorhead(Ace Of Spades),K.C And The Sunshine Band(Boogie Man)and more. Great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Judd Apatow,Comedy films or Teen films,I highly suggest you see Superbad,an hilarious and funny modern Comedy classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,2,18 June 2013
Hot Fuzz," An Excellent And Hilarious Action-Comedy Cult Classic.
","Hot Fuzz is an Excellent and hilarious Action-Comedy that is filled,fantastic direction,an amazing cast,great laughs,explosive Action,a wonderful script and a memorable film score making Hot Fuzz a outstanding Cult Classic.Set in the United Kingdom,Hot Fuzz tells the story of Nicolas Angel,a decorated by the book British Police Officer who's really good at his job in fact Nicolas is so good that his superiors feel that Nicolas makes his fellow officers look bad. And because of that,Nicolas' superiors transfer him to Sanford a small crime free town in Rural Gloucestershire to continue his police work and is partnered with bumbling cop Sgt. Danny Butterman. While there Nicolas discovers that there have gruesome murders of town folk that are made to look like accidents and when decides Nicolas to investigate and laughs,Action and Chaos ensues.After the critical and financial success of the Zombie Horror Comedy Cult Classic Shaun Of The Dead many wondered what would director Edgar Wright,Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do for an encore and the great trio responded with Hot Fuzz,an hilarious and very thrilling Action-Comedy that is the second film in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy and is another Cult Classic. If Shaun Of The Dead was a film that mocked and paid homage to Zombie movies and Horror films then Hot Fuzz is a film that mocks and pays tribute to Action movies and Buddy Cop films of the 1980s and 90s. As someone who loves and is a huge fan of the Action film genre I loved what the film Hot Fuzz was doing and what the film was doing taking a funny and hilarious target at the Action film genre and it's trademarks with non stop laughs and thrilling,no holds barred Action and the film never stops until the very end. The Comedy and Humor in HF is done with greatness and manic energy that is clever and offbeat almost to the point where you will be weak from all of the laughing you be doing while watching the movie. Edgar Wright loves Action films and Wright and HF wears it's Action film style on it's sleeve and makes hilarious references to Action and Buddy Cop films such as Die Hard,Lethal Weapon,Point Break and Bad Boys II(the latter two which are shown in HF)and also has some Action movie trademarks such as Gunfights,explosions and car chases. HF makes fun of Action scenes that you have seen in certain Action films and are serious but HF turns serious Action scenes on their head with smarts and dry wit. If you are an Action movie lover you will love Hot Fuzz's great sense of humor. Nicolas Angel and Danny Butterman are an amazing and funny Buddy Action duo that follow the classic tradition Buddy cop duo such as Riggs and Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon and Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond in 48 Hrs. Like those two fantastic duos Nicolas and Danny don't really like each other in the beginning(or in this case Nicolas doesn't like Danny)because Nicolas is the straight man and Danny is the funny one and loves Action films but as the movie goes on Nicolas and Danny start to like and understand each other and how they do things and when the two characters are together there is great laughs and humor but also depth and personality that is real. Nicolas and Danny are a memorable and unforgettable Action Buddy cop team that will stay with you after watching the film. The screenplay by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg is fantastic and really well-done giving the characters laugh out loud,rapid fire dialog that is fun and over the top and every joke in the film is done in such a flawless way. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and thrilling and will definitely have viewers excited and glued to the screen because with each Action scene there is so much devotion to detail and execution that every Action scene had to be perfect and the Action scenes are perfect. The ending or final 30 minutes of Hot Fuzz is thrilling and masterful because it mixes non stop laughs and explosive Action that have you roaring with laughter and on the edge of your seat the whole time and will definitely put a smile on your face. An funny and outstanding conclusion to Hot Fuzz.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Simon Pegg is excellent and funny as Sgt. Nicolas Angel,with Pegg bringing deadpan Comedy to the role. Nick Frost is brilliant and hilarious as Danny,Angel's new partner and has great scenes and chemistry with Pegg. Jim Broadbent is fantastic as Inspector Frank Butterman,Danny's Father. Timothy Dalton is wonderful as Simon Skinner,a local Supermarket owner. Also,lookout for credited and uncredited cameos by Cate Balanchett(Janie),Film Director Peter Jackson(Thief Dressed as Santa),Steve Coogan(Metropolitian Police Inspector)and Bill Nighy(Met Chief Inspector).The direction by Edgar Wright is brilliant and stylish,with Wright always moving the camera with zooms,close-ups and tracking shots and giving the film a wonderful energy and Wright also does a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Wright.The score by David Arnold is fantastic,intense and thrilling and matches the Action movie tone of the film. Incredible score,Arnold. There is also great songs on the soundtrack by artists such as Supergrass(Caught By The Fuzz)and many more. A wonderful soundtrack.In final word,if you love,Edgar Wright,Action Films,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Hot Fuzz,an Excellent,hilarious and explosive Action-Comedy Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,0,19 August 2013
L.A. Confidential," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. A Classic Crime Drama/Film-Noir/Thriller/Mystery.
","L.A Confidential is one of the best films ever made that mixes great direction,wonderful characters and a excellent screenplay. It's not only one of the best films of the 90s,but of all-time,a classic of Film-Noir and Crime Drama and one of my favorite movies.Based on James Ellroy's novel and set in Los Angeles,California in the early 1950s,L.A Confidential tells the story of three L.A.P.D cops Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey),Wendell 'Bud' White(Russell Crowe)and Edmund J. Exley(Guy Pierce)who are all different kinds of police officers and had nothing in common. Jack does it for the fame,Bud does it for fear and brutality and Edmund does it to rise above the ranks and live up to his legendary Father who was also a cop. But when one of their own is murdered in a coffee shop robbery,the three cops must come together and solve the case that's filled with twists and turns.L.A Confidential is a brilliant,classic film that was kind of overlooked and underrated in 1997. Despite doing well at the box-office,receiving critical acclaim and being nominated for 8 Oscars and winning two L.A Confidential was overshadowed by James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic. But thankfully L.A Confidential's reputation has grown and the film has become a classic and rightfully so because this film is one of those movies is that if you watch it on television or DVD you never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. One of the many reasons L.A Confidential is a great film is because of the way the film shows Los Angeles in the early 1950s,because when people think of L.A in the 50s they think movie stars,palm trees,beaches and sunny skies. But L.A.C gives viewers a dark world filled with intrigue and Mystery where L.A is surrounded by a dark and bleak underbelly of violence,sex,drugs and police corruption,selling a false and fake image of L.A as a beautiful paradise,but the L.A in this film is far from a paradise showing 1950s Los Angeles and how it really was the way people in L.A knew about but people outside of L.A didn't really know of. L.A.C is a Film-Noir in the truest since with the characters actions that are harsh and sometimes brutal where the characters defined by their actions just as much as their words and every character is not black and white but in shades of gray a Film-Noir in where nothing is what it seems and no one is who they say they are and there is plenty of twists and turns on every corner. And while L.A.C is in the great style and genre of Film-Noir it is not film in the classic style of Film-Noir:black and white photography,dark shadows and harsh and surreal lighting,but natural lighting. Dante Spinotti's beautiful photography and lighting is more natural and realistic where the sunlight is shown in the way it is in the real world and not in the movies. While the film is 2 1/2 hours the movie moves at such fast pace you feel like you the movie is 90 minutes instead of 137 minutes. There are many characters in the film but everyone gets enough screen time and no role,character or dialog is wasted. The screenplay by Curtis Hansen and Brian Helgeland is just excellent and memorable,with Hansen and Helgeland taking James Ellroy's gritty and tough dialog,the characters from the book and makes situations and moments feel real and just come to life. And while the film doesn't necessary follow the storyline exactly like the book,the spirit of Ellroy's style and writing is still felt throughout the film. The movie's three main characters Jack,Bud and Ed are great characters who fit in the style of Film-Noir and are really well-developed because in the beginning of the film you do not always like them or the things that they do but as the film goes along you begin like them and relate to the three characters in different ways and discover their complex personalities and who they are Although L.A.C isn't an Action film there are a few great Action scenes in the film that are filled with great suspense and surprises during the Action scenes. The final 15-20 minutes of the film is Crime Drama and Film-Noir at it's best and will have you glued to the screen with it's Action and great suspense. A great ending.The whole cast is brilliant in their roles. Kevin Spacey is excellent as Sgt. Jack Vincennes,with Spacey bringing a calm and cool feeling to the performance. Russell Crowe is brilliant and at his best as Wendell Bud White,with Russell bringing anger and intensity to the role. Guy Pearce is fantastic as Ed Exley,with Pearce conveying intelligence and cleverness with the performance. Great character actor James Cromwell is terrific and memorable as cop Dudley Smith. Kim Basinger is wonderful and beautiful as Lynn Bracken,a hooker with a heart of gold and Bud's love interest. Danny DeVito is great as slimy tabloid reporter Sid Hudgens. The Underrated David Strathaim is fabulous and smooth as Pierce Moorehouse Patchett,Lynn's pimp. Ron Rifkin(D.A Ellis Loew),Simon Baker(Matt Reynolds),Graham Beckel(Dick Stensland)and Plalo Seganti(Johnny Stompanato)give fine performances as well.The direction by Curtis Hanson is excellent,with Hanson always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace with a great visual style while also doing well with the Action scenes. Great direction by Hanson.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is intense,brooding,excellent and fits in with film's Film-Noir tone. I also loved Goldsmith's homage to his classic score from Chinatown in one of the scenes. Great score from Goldsmith. The film also has great songs on the soundtrack from Dean Martin(The Christmas Blues,Powder Your Face with Sunshine),Kay Starr(Wheel Of Fortune),Jonny Mercer(Hit The Road To Dreamland)and more.In final word,if you love Crime Dramas,Film-Noir,Mystery,James Ellroy or films in general I highly suggest you see L.A Confidential,an absolute classic of cinema that you can watch again and again and never get tired of. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,2,14 April 2013
The Hateful Eight," An Excellent,Thrilling And Entertaining Western. Quentin Tarantino At His Best.
","The Hateful Eight is an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a wonderful script,beautiful photography and a memorable score. All of those elements make The Hateful Eight an unforgettable film that is Quentin Tarantino at his best.Set in post-Civil War Wyoming,The Hateful Eight tells the story of eight people including Major Marcus Warren(Samuel L. Jackson),a bounty hunter,John Ruth(Kurt Russell)another bounty hunter holding fugitive and prisoner Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh)and Chris Mannix(Walton Goggins),a man claiming to be a new Sheriff,Bob(Demian Bichir),Oswaldo Mobray(Tim Roth),Joe Gage(Michael Madsen)and Sanford Smithers(Bruce Dern)who are all in a stagecoach holdover trying escape a blizzard. But all of these strangers will be involved in a mystery with twists and deception.The Hateful Eight is a brilliant and entertaining Western from Quentin Tarantino and it is a thrilling,bloody,brutal and epic film that is a blast from start to finish mixing together genres Western,Mystery and Action. With The Hateful Eight Tarantino has made a film that is a companion piece to his previous films Inglorious Basterds(2009)and Django Unchained(2012)which are very much alike in scope,look and tone and if you seen those films or Tarantino's other films it has all of the known elements:rich dialog,over the top violence and memorable characters that will stay with you. Like those two films The Hateful Eight is long in length you will not be bored. While a companion piece to both Basterds and Django,The Hateful Eight in terms of structure is more of a call back to Tarantino's classic debut Reservoir Dogs(1992)in which a bunch of strangers are together in one room where there is distrust and paranoia among them but this time set in the 19th century. The screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is well-written and strong,with Tarantino giving the main characters memorable dialog that is funny,interesting and make scenes standout. As for the main characters each one of The Hateful Eight is memorable but the characters Marquis Warren,John Ruth,Daisy Domergue and Chris Mannix are standouts and are classic characters from Tarantino who are going to liked or disliked depending on your point of view but are delightful in true Tarantino style. The photography(which was shot in the glorious 70mm format)by Robert Richardson is beautiful and visually stunning whether it's the shots of snowy mountains or inside shots the movie is amazing to look at. One of the things I love about The Hateful Eight is how it's the story is structure and told with not just the dividing chapters but amazing build-up. The first 90 minutes of the film is a dialog and character driven affair like a stage play where we get to know the main characters about who they are and what they are about and we as a viewer are fascinated. The second to last half of the film takes a different turn and becomes a violent and insane bloodbath mixing together Western violence with an Agatha Christie-style Mystery in the vein of Murder on The Orient Express and Ten Little Indians where there is twists and turns all around and you keep your eyes glued to the screen trying to solve a puzzle and put the pieces together and wondering who will survive this bizarre tale. The Action and violence is riveting and surprising with the blood and gore just coming off the screen at as if you were the movie with the characters. If you love storytelling the structure and mixture of Western and Mystery will be a great watch. The ending of The Hateful Eight is terrific with great Action,dialog and thrills that brings the movie full circle. An amazing conclusion.The cast is amazing. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent,memorable and at his best as Major Marquis Warren,a bounty hunter. Kurt Russell is terrific as John Ruth,a fellow bounty hunter. Jennifer Jason Leigh is outstanding as Daisy Domergue,a fugitive in Ruth's capture. Walton Goggins is wonderful as Chris Mannix,a Southern renegade. Demian Bichir does a fine job as Bob,a Mexican caretaker. Tim Roth is amazing as Oswaldo Mobray,a hangman. Michael Madsen is great as Joe Gage,a Cowpuncher. Bruce Dern is fantastic as Sanford Smithers,s southern soldier.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is fantastic and stylish with Tarantino bringing his usual flair,look and atmosphere to the film. Amazing direction,Tarantino.The score by Ennio Morricone is epic,mysterious and intense matching the tone and style of the movie greatly. Sensational score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you watch The Hateful Eight,an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that Quentin Tarantino at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,52,121,22 December 2015
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," One Of The Greatest Films And Comedies Ever Made. An Excellent,Hilarious,Unforgettable Masterpiece From Stanley Kubrick.
","Dr. Strangelove Or:How I Stopped Worrying And Love The Bomb is one of the greatest films and Comedies ever made,an excellent,hilarious and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,terrific acting from the cast,great laughs and dark Humor,a wonderful script and a memorable score. All of those elements make Dr. Strangelove not only my favorite Stanley Kubrick film but also my favorite Comedy that is cinema at it's best.Based on the novel Red Alert by Peter George,Dr. Strangelove tells the story of an Army General Jack D. Ripper(Sterling Hayden)who is worried and paranoid about Americas 'precious bodily fluids' and Communist subversion sends Army Aircraft planes to attack Russia with one of the planes commanded by Major T.J 'King' Kong(Silm Pickens). With the aircraft's on the way to Russia it's up to Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,President Merkin Muffley,Dr. Strangelove(all played by Peter Sellers)and General Buck Turgidson(George C. Scott)to stop it and prevent Nuclear War.Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove or:How I Stopped Worrying and Love The Bomb is a brilliant and outstanding film that is film making at it's very best and is an instant masterpiece and classic the first time you watch it and one of the funniest movies of all-time that is hilarious and offbeat,dangerous and crazy as it is Satirical and frightening and is the true definition of Black Comedy. Whenever at watch this movie I often think how on earth was Kubrick able to get a major studio to make Dr. Strangelove because this was a brave and bold movie to make especially in 1964 during the time of the Cold War and Americans were afraid of Bombs dropping on the United States and a Nuclear war and with Dr. Strangelove Kubrick makes Nuclear War funny. I guess that's why Kubrick use to call this movie a 'Nightmare Comedy' taking something serious and terrifying as Nuclear War and making it funny in a way that is ingenious and daring and years after it's 1964 release the film has not lost it's impact. There is a weirdness and energy in Dr Strangelove that never stops and when you watch the movie you are in for a ride for 94 insane minutes. The Comedy and laughs in Dr. Strangelove is hilarious,demented and is done with such a darkly Humorous glee that is perfectly balanced between the Comedy and laughs going completely over the top and playing it straight with intelligence and great timing because of the main characters and the wild things that happen throughout the film. The Comedy also works because each of the events that take place in Dr. Strangelove in different settings(Military Base,The War Room and Aircraft)making the situations more funny,wild and at times eerie and claustrophobic. Most of Kubrick's films have moments of Comedy and Dark Humor but this was Kubrick first and only Comedy where there is laughs all over the movie. I also loved the Satire in this film and how the movie makes fun of politicians and The screenplay by Stanley Kubrick,Peter George and Terry Southern is terrific,amazing and one of the funniest screenplays in a Comedy film because the dialog has a strange and ironic style that is very memorable,quirky and will make you burst with laughter. The main characters in Dr. Strangelove are funny and entertaining and we are with each of them as we witness the chaos that is happening all around them. Another thing I love about Dr. Strangelove is that while the movie is a Comedy the look and style of the movie will make you think you are watching a serious dramatic film with an undertone of paranoia and tension(there's a little paranoia in the movie but it's done for laughs). The ending of Dr Strangelove is amazing and one of the best and funniest endings in the history of film and while it is abrupt,it's an ending that goes well with the apocalyptic tone of the film and is one of the reasons Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece. An outstanding conclusion.The cast is outstanding. Peter Sellers earned an Academy Award nomination for his excellent,hilarious and unforgettable performances in three roles as Lionel Mandrake,Merkinn Muffy and Dr. Strangelove with Sellers masterfully being funny and serious. Amazing performances. George C. Scott is brilliant and delightfully over the top as General 'Buck' Turgidson with Scott stealing every scene he's in. Sterling Hayden is sensational as General Jack D. Ripper,a paranoid General. Silm Pickens is outstanding and funny as Major 'King' Kong,the man in charge of the Aircraft. Keenen Wynn is wonderful as Colonial 'Bat' Guano,a straight laced Soldier. Peter Bull is fantastic as Russian Ambassador Alexi De Sadesky,doing a great Russian accent. James Earl Jones(Lt. Lothar Zogg)and Tracy Redd(Miss Scott)give good performances as well.The direction by Stanley Kubrick is masterful with Kubrick giving the film an amazing visual style and sometimes moving the camera with creative angles and atmosphere. Fantastic direction,Kubrick.The score by Laurie Johnson is great,memorable and matches the film's tone. Good score,Johnson. There is also the terrific song We'll Meet Again by Vera Lynn that is put used wonderfully. You'll never listen to the song the same way again.In final word if you love Stanley Kubrick,,Comedies,Black Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Dr. Strangelove,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,hilarious and unforgettable Masterpiece that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,4,21 December 2014
MASH," One Of The Greatest Films And Comedies Of Ever Made. An Excellent And Hilarious Classic Black Comedy War Film. Robert Altman At His Best.
","MASH is one of the greatest Comedies Of all time and a classic film that combines amazing direction,a fantastic ensemble cast,hilarious Black Comedy,wonderful script and a memorable film score making MASH one of Altman's best and a classic Comedy and War Film and not only one of the best films of the 1970s but one of the greatest films ever made.Based on the novel MASH:A Novel About Three Army Doctors and set during the Korean War in the early 1950s,MASH tells the story of a group of Army surgeons that includes Capt. Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),Trapper John McIntyre(Elliot Gould)and Duke Forrest(Tom Skerritt)that work inside a hospital and deal with Horrors of the War while getting into hilarious situations and misadventures.Before MASH was turned into the iconic and popular television series of the same name,MASH was an amazing,hilarious and edgy Black Comedy classic that was an Anti-War Satire and was also a cinema breakthrough for filmmaker Robert Altman and is a film that ranks with other great films and Black Comedies Dr Strangelove and Network and is one of the film that gave birth to the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s. One of the reasons MASH is a classic film is because Robert Altman takes the concept and subject of War and makes an Anti-War film that mocks the military and Wars in a funny and Satirical way that is bold and brave and at the same time creative and subversive in a original style. The Comedy and laughs in MASH is funny and hilarious and is done with in darkly Humorous way with scenes and dialog in the film that is smart and intelligent and can only exist in the bizarre and insane world of MASH that is truly wacky and offbeat and done with a weirdness and insane energy that never slows down or lets up until the very end and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I also love that The Comedy is politically incorrect and is the kind of Humor that you don't really see in films anymore and would offend viewers in today's world. What I also love about MASH is the episodic nature and structure of the film where there are scenes in the movie that jump from one to the next and some of the characters pop in and out of the narrative but the film is never disjointed or disconnected and I think the episodic style keeps the film moving at a great pace. While the film is set during the Korean War in the 1950s,MASH is more about the Vietnam War that was going on in the during the 1960s and 70s and Altman doesn't hold back in showing the danger and Horrors of going to War especially during the Hospital and surgery scenes which are done in a gritty and realistic way almost like a documentary of Surgery in Hospitals during a War. MASH is a Comedy and it is very funny but it's still an Anti-War film that is told from a cynical point of view that is harsh and unflinching. The three main characters in the film Hawkeye Pierce,Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest are great and truly memorable characters because when you look at the characters you feel like that even though they are surgeons of War they don't really want to be in the War or military but rather in a bar drinking a small glass of martini,flirting with women or being at home and not participating in the War. The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending.The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman.The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone.In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,3,4 September 2013
Taxi Driver," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful And Unforgettable Masterpiece Of Cinema. Martin Scorsese And Robert De Niro At Their Best.
","Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing direction powerful performances from Robert De Niro and a great cast,a terrific script and a fantastic score. All of those elements make Taxi Driver one my favorite movies and Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro at their best.Set in New York City,Taxi Driver tells the story of Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro),a Vietnam veteran and Marine who drives a Taxi mostly at night and makes good money. But Travis is a loner,depressed,mentally disturbed and is sick of the disgusting things he sees on the streets with criminals,drug pushers,pimps and lowlifes so Travis decides to take the law in his own hands. While taking the law into his own hands Travis sees a young Prostitute(Jodie Foster)from pimps and decides to rescue her.Taxi Driver is a brilliant and riveting masterpiece and instant classic from the first time you watch it where just about everything from the acting,direction and screenplay are all are perfect and flawless and was the second collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro after the amazing and underrated classic Mean Streets in 1973. Taxi Driver is also one of the main movies of the New Hollywood era of the 70s is one of the greatest films of the 1970s that years after it's release in 1976 never loses it's impact. Taxi Driver is a film that right from the very start pulls viewers into a nightmare that never lets go until the end and is a film that is dark and violent as well as very bleak and uncompromising with harsh and gritty style that is all it's own. Taxi Driver is also one of the best films about New York City and I think the depiction of the city adds to Taxi Driver's atmosphere which is grim. The city of New York in Taxi Driver is filthy and dirty showing viewers how most of New York City was during the 1970s with pimps,drug dealers,prostitutes and violence that was on the New York streets at that time. Scorsese captures the insanity of New York showing a place where nothing is cleaned up. Taxi Driver also shows the fear and paranoia of the post Vietnam,post Watergate world where some things are falling apart and there seems to be distrust and anger all around with no hope or salvation. Vigilante movies were huge during the 70s and early 1980s thanks to Death Wish and exploitation films during that period and while Taxi Driver is a vigilante movie it's much more character driven and doesn't glamorize violence. Speaking of the violence,the violence in Taxi Driver is shocking and brutal and shows violence and what it really is The screenplay by Paul Schrader is amazing,masterful and one of the best screenplays in film history with Schrader giving the script great dialog that is harsh and brooding with moments of mesmerizing depth and greatness that make the film. The main character Travis Bickle is one of the greatest,most iconic and truly unforgettable characters in movie history who is an antihero. One of the reasons Travis such a great character because we are fascinated by him at the same time disturbed by him. We are fascinated by Travis because the whole movie is seen from his point of view and we feel Bickle's isolation and the thoughts of being alone or because Travis can talk to people but not on a consistent basis and can only express himself in his diary and thoughts. We are disturbed by Travis because we don't really know if he's a hero or a villain he can be a little bit both because Bickle is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode based on his actions whether it's physical or verbal because Bickle is disturbed by his environment. The movie let's us make up our own conclusions. Travis Bickle is a classic character that you will never forget and will truly live forever,especially the classic 'you talking to me scene'. The ending of Taxi Driver is outstanding and one of best endings ever caught on film because it's a mixture of ambiguity,violence and questions that will never be answered which will cause many debates with no final conclusion. A brilliant ending to a masterful film.The cast is terrific. Robert De Niro is excellent,powerful and gives one of the greatest acting performances of all-time in his most iconic role as Travis Bickle with De Niro being intense and believable. Jodie Foster is brilliant and fiery as Iris,a young hooker Travis wants to help. Harvey Keitel is riveting as Sport,Iris' pimp. Cybill Shepard is terrific and beautiful as Betsy,a woman and political campaign worker Travis likes. Albert Brooks is funny and memorable as Tom,a co-worker of Betsy's. Peter Boyle is fantastic as Wizard,a fellow Taxi driver that gives Travis some advice. Leonard Harris is wonderful as Charles Palantine,a politician running for President. Director Martin Scorsese is creepy as one of Travis passengers. Murray Moston(Iris' Timekeeper) Harry Northup(Doughboy),Steven Prince(Andy-Gun Salesman),Joe Spinell(Personnel Officer),Victor Argo(Melio)and Diahanne Abbott(Concession Girl)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is outstanding and masterful,with Scorsese constantly moving the camera with tracking shots,great angles and close-ups as well as beautiful lighting. Amazing direction,Scorsese.The score by Bernard Herrmann is beautiful,haunting,memorable and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. A terrific score,Herrmann.The making-up by Dick Smith is fantastic,realistic and add to the film. RIP,Mr Smith.In final word if you love Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro or films in general,I highly suggest you see Taxi Driver,an excellent and powerful masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,2,3 August 2014
American Hustle," An Excellent,Entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama From David O'Russell.
","American Hustle is an excellent and entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack all of those elements make American Hustle a great film that has to be seen.Set in New York City in the late 1970s,American Hustle tells the story of two con artists,Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale)and Sydney Prosser(Amy Adams)who have been forced by FBI agent Richie DiMasso(Bradley Cooper)to participate in a FBI operation called ABSCAM,a sting operation to set up corrupt politicians including Camden,New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and gangsters. As the stakes become higher and with danger coming at every corner Irving and Sydney have to figure out how to get out and survive.Throughout the history of cinema,con artists and Grifters have been covered in movies ranging from The Sting(1973),The Grifters(1990)and now American Hustle,an amazing film from beginning to end that keep your attention with fantastic movie making that never stops. Right from it's weird and offbeat opening American Hustle is a movie that combines Comedy,Crime Drama and a true life tale that is funny and quirky and at other times serious and intense giving viewers a movie that plays by it's own rules and creates it's own world. With American Hustle David O'Russell gives us a movie that is dazzling bringing viewers into the crime world of the 1970s showing the personal and professional lives of con artists,federal agents,politicians and gangsters never knowing where the story or it's characters will go and even though AH is a fact based story the movie is not too dark. When you look at American Hustle you will see that the movie was obviously influenced in many ways by Director Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics such as Goodfellas(1990)and Casino(1995)with the way the camera moves,the style and look of the film,and the use of narration but instead of Gangsters and Mobsters O'Russell replaces them with con artists and Grifters. The Scorsese influence is definitely felt throughout but O'Russell takes the style and feel of Scorsese's films and makes it his own with great success. The Comedy in AH is great and hilarious because the laughs are never forced on viewers or telling them when scenes are funny but lets the viewers figure out when scenes are funny whether it's in some of the scenes or in the main characters dialog or actions. The Comedy is balanced out by the Crime Drama elements as well which are done with attention and detail like a other Crime Dramas and you are gripped with every scene that involves cops and crime. But the Crime Drama element isn't always serious and is entertaining. The beautiful photography by Linus Sandgren and amazing production design by Judy Becker truly add to the film and give AH a realistic look and feel of the 1970s with vibrant colors and sets that pulls you into the world that AH wants to portray and it's one of the main reasons that the movie succeeds because with the great photography and production there is a brilliant and accurate look of the 1970s that just makes the movie come alive. The main characters in the film whether it's the con artists,federal agents are fascinating and interesting with laughs and depth because with each main character everyone wants to succeed at what they do whether it's good or bad. Also,with the characters there is no black and white but a gray area that is complex and real and you will relate to some of the characters in some ways. The screenplay by Eric Singer and David O'Russell is impressive and well-done with dialog that is a mixture of being funny and serious. The ending of American Hustle is truly wonderful,surprising and unexpected and fits with films about con artists and Grifters. An outstanding conclusion to a great movie.The whole cast is amazing. Christian Bale is excellent and at his best as Irving Rosenfield,with Bale bringing intensity and emotional(and physical)depth to the role. Bradley Cooper is brilliant and funny as FBI agent Richie DiMasso,with Copper being offbeat and dramatic. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful as Sydney Prosser,Irving's partner in crime and has great scenes with Bale,Cooper and Lawrence. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as Mayor Carmine Polito,a New Jersey politician. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and sexy as Roselyn Rosenfield,Irving's attractive but overbearing wife. Also,lookout for a great uncredited appearance from Robert De Niro in a great performance as Victor Tellegio,a high level gangster. Louis C.K(Stoddard Thorsen),Jack Huston(Pete Musane),Michael Pena(Paco Hernandez),Shea Whigham(Carl),Alessandro Nivola(Anthony Amando)and Paul Hermane(Alfonse Simone)give good performances as well.The direction by David O'Russell is brilliant and stylish,with O'Russell always moving the camera with tracking shots,close-ups and a nice visual style. Terrific direction,O'Russell.The score Danny Elfman isn't always used but good when it's heard. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Elton John(Goodbye Yellow Brick Road),Wings(Live And Let Die),The Temptations(Papa Was A Rolling Stone),Duke Ellington(Jeep's Blues)and more. Outstanding soundtrack.In final word,if you love David O'Russell,Comedies,Crime Dramas or movies in general,I highly suggest you see American Hustle,an excellent,entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama film that you never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,4,12 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made,The Greatest Sequel Of All Time And An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful And Unforgettable Mastepiece From Francis Coppola.
","The Godfather Part II is not only one of the greatest films ever mad but is also the greatest sequel of all-time that is an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,terrific acting from a great cast,a wonderful script and a haunting score. All of those elements make The Godfather Part II film making and Francis Coppola at their best.Set in Las Vegas,Nevada in the 1950s and in New York City in the 1910s and 20s,The Godfather Part II tells two parallel rise and fall stories. The rise story depicts the rise of young Vito Corleone(Robert De Niro),showing Vito as an Italian immigrant who gets into a life of Crime and becomes a Don. The fall is the story of Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)who is still running the Corleone family in Las Vegas but has to deal with betrayal and the family falling apart.The Godfather Part II is simply a masterpiece of cinema and is the greatest and most ambitious sequel of all-time that is not only an instant classic from the moment you watch it but also an amazing and powerful follow-up to the original giving viewers not only a great continuation of The Godfather saga but giving viewers the sequel to end all movie sequels. I won't say which film is better because in my opinion saying Part I or Part II is better than one another would be disrespectful to the two films because both are works of art. With The Godfather Part II Director Francis Ford Coppola has created not only created just a sequel but a film that is more epic with a bigger and larger scope than the first film giving viewers a powerful experience that never lets you go from the opening frame. With The Godfather Part II viewers are not just given a movie about the Mob,Gangsters or the Crime world but a movie about the on going tragedy,sadness and doom that hangs over The Corleone family while showing the rise of a young Vito Corleone. This film is probably more darker than the first film because when we see the fall of Michael Corleone and the rest of the Corleone family is almost like the fall of the Roman Empire. Unlike most sequels The Godfather Part II doesn't make the same story like the original but gives us something new and fresh with a great tale that is on par with the first film. The Godfather Part II is an epic film in the truest sense of the word not just in the way it's film but the length of the film(at 3 hrs and 20 minutes)but the film moves by seamlessly that you forget you are watching a three and half hour film. I think the film moves at a fast pace is because of the amazing storytelling that Coppola does with the film giving the movie a nonlinear style with the movie moving back and forth with the time periods but never getting lost in the narrative. In GFII we are given two tales about Michael's downfall and young Vito's rise. Michael,while still a don and running the Corleone family has become more ruthless and colder then he was in the first film further isolating himself from his other family members and becoming less trusting with the people all around him whether it's business associates or family where everyone was his enemy which leads to Michael's tragic fall. In contrast we see a young Vito Corleone,a man who is about business but is also about his family and friends despite being in the violent world of the Mob and Vito handles things with calm and cool style. When we see Michael and Vito the lighting is different with Michael constantly being surrounded by darkness and Vito is surrounded in bright light showing the contrast in atmosphere. With Michael and Vito we see how complex and different they are not just as Dons but as people. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is outstanding with scenes and dialog that is memorable and on par with the first film. While GFII isn't as violent or bloody as the original and doesn't have a huge body count GFII still has a few violent scenes that done with attention to detail and build-up. The ending of The Godfather Part II is one of the best endings in movie history because it's sad,tragic and somber matching the dark tone of the rest of the movie and the ending will punch you in the gut. A powerful ending.The cast is perfect. Al Pacino is excellent,powerful and at his best as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being cold,intense and ruthless in the performance. Robert De Niro is brilliant in his Oscar winning role as Young Vito Corleone,with De Niro being cool and charismatic. Robert DuVall is wonderful once again as Tom Hagen,The Corleone's lawyer. John Cazale is amazing as Fredo Corleone,Michael's dim-witted older brother. Diane Keaton is outstanding as Kay,Michael's suffering wife. Talia Shire is sensational as Connie Corleone,Michael's sister. Lee Strasberg is terrific as Hyman Roth,an old time gangster and associate of the Corleone's. Michael V. Gazzo is captivating as Frank Pentangelli,a member of the Corleone family. Bruno Kurby and John Aprea are great Young Clemenza and Young Tesso. G.D Sparadin(Senator Pat Geary),Dominic Chianese(Johnny Ola),Frank Sivero(Genco)and Richard Bright(Al Neri)give great performances as well.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is amazing and stylish,with Coppola bringing a beautiful and haunting visual style to the film. Terrific direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is outstanding,powerful,haunting and beautiful matching the main scenes in the film. Great score,Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster films,Mob movies,the first Godfather or movies in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather Part II,an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest films and sequels of all-time and is a movie that you will watch again and again.

Fargo," An Excellent Crime Drama/Black Comedy and One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. A Mesmerising Classic Masterpiece Of Cinema From The Coen Brothers.
","Fargo is one of the greatest films ever made,a Classic Masterpiece of cinema that mixes Crime Drama and Black Comedy. Filled with brilliant direction,a great cast,a wonderful script,beautiful photography and an unforgettable haunting score,Fargo is The Coen Brothers and filmmaking at it's best.Set in Minnesota 1987 and Based on a True story,Fargo tells the story of Jerry Lundegaard(William H. Macy),a used car salesman who is now in debt and owes money. Feeling desperate,Jerry hires criminals Carl Showalter(Steve Buscemi)and Gaear Grimsrud(Peter Stormare)to kidnap Jerry's wife Jean Lundegaard(Kristen Ruddrud)for ransom. But when things go wrong and people are killed,Jerry,Carl and Gaear and the killings are being investigated by pregnant cop Marge Gunderson(Francis McDormand)and things become more chaotic and out of control.Fargo is an unforgettable Classic Masterpiece that came out at the right time for The Coen Brothers. After the critical and Box Office failure of their hilarious and underrated big budgeted period Comedy The Hudsucker Proxy,The Coen Brothers decided to return to the low budget roots of their first film Blood Simple and make Fargo an amazing film that was critically acclaimed,won multiple film awards and became one of The Coen Brothers career defining and greatest films. Fargo is one of the reason that cinema and filmmaking is such a great art form because Fargo right from the start gives you a film that will have you glued to the screen with it's themes of greed,death and violence and the themes and film experience for Fargo never loses it's power after the film is over. What also makes Fargo an incredible film is it's great mixture of Crime Drama with Black Comedy mixing serious things like murder and kidnapping and combing it with morbid Humor because The Coens are masters at taking serious things that are not supposed to be funny and making them hilarious. The Black Comedy in this film is very funny,surprising and unexpected whether it's the films characters their dialog or the situations the characters are involved in and the Comedy is original and bleak and you will never look at the Midwest the same way again. The Cinematography by Roger Deakins is beautiful,haunting and effective giving the Midwest and Minessota a great scenery and wide landscape despite all of the truly horrible things going on throughout the film. Deakins amazing and flawless photography also makes the snow and Winter atmosphere just come off the screen and when a character is walking in the snow or the cold you as the viewer feel like you are right there in the snow. Marge Gunderson is a great character and maybe one of the greatest and most interesting and fascinating characters in film history because she's so likable and optimistic and loves her job as a cop. You would figure with her being big and pregnant that Marge would take a vacation off but Marge continues to do her job like it's nothing. What I also love about the Marge character is that the film shows two sides of her in the film her personal life as a wife dealing with pregnancy and loving her husband and her professional life as a cop and her professional life comes into play with this film. When the violence and death happen all around under Marge's nose she cannot understand why all of this violence is happening. Marge's optimism view is an interesting contrast to the Horror,danger and violence happening in throughout the film. Marge is another classic creation from The Coen Brothers. The quotable screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen(which won the Oscar for best original screenplay)is outstanding and perfect,with The Coens giving each of the films main characters funny and memorable dialog and using Minnesota language and dialect/accents and words like yeah(or 'Yah')and quotes such as 'you betcha' over and over again. Another great screenplay by The Coens. The violence in Fargo is harsh,brutal shocking,disturbing and at times darkly funny and matches the films grim tone and will definitely surprise viewers. The ending of the film sad,disturbing and at the same time hopeful and optimistic especially hopeful for the character Marge. A wonderful ending.The whole cast in the film is brilliant. Francis McDormand earn a Best Actress Oscar for her excellent performance as Marge Gunderson,with McDormand bring optimism,humor and great depth to the role. A great performance. William H. Macy is wonderful as Jerry Lundegaard,a car sales man in debt. Steve Buscemi is fantastic as Carl,a fast talking criminal. Peter Stormare is great and intense as Gaear,Carl's partner that's a man of few words. Harve Presnall is amazing and funny as Wade Gustafson,Jean's Father. Kristin Ruddud(Jean Lundegaard),Larry Brandenburg(Stan Grossman),John Carroll Lynch(Norm Gunderson),Steve Reevis(Shep Proudfoot),Steve Park(Mike Yanagita)and Tony Denman(Scotty Lundegaard)give good performances as well.The Direction by The Coen Brothers is brilliant and masterful,with The Coens always moving the camera with close-ups,zooms,over head and shooting from the snow filled roads from a distance giving the film beautiful visual style. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is amazing,powerful,epic and intense and matches the film's tone and every scene in the film. A mesmerizing score from Burwell.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Crime Dramas,Black Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Fargo,a brilliant and flawless Classic Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and deserves to be in any film lover's collection. Highly Recommend. 10/10.",10,0,0,26 June 2013
Predator," One Of The Greatest Action Movies Of All Time And An Excellent,Unforgettable Classic. Arnold Schwarzenegger And John McTierman At Their Best
","Predator is one of the greatest Action movies ever made that mixes Action,Sci-Fi,Adventure and Horror and is not only one of my favorite Action movies,but one of my favorite movies period. Filled with brilliant,non-stop Action,great direction and amazing special effects Predator is an excellent and unforgettable Action classic and is Arnold Schwarzenegger and John McTierman at their best.Set in Central America,Predator tells the story about a group of commandos who have been sent on a rescue mission. While they complete their mission the group discover that they are being hunted by a lethal alien. Now Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger)and his squad have to figure out how to stop this alien and stay alive.What if the character Rambo faced off against the Alien in the Alien franchise? You get Predator,an intense,Action packed film that is one of the greatest Action films of all time and an unforgettable classic that never slows down and is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. One of the things that I love about Predator is the way that it's set-up in the first 40 minutes. During the early part of the film we assume as the viewer that this is going to be just another Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle,but the film cleverly turns you on it's head when the alien attacks and kills and you know that this is not going to be your regular Schwarzenegger film,but a tale of survival and staying alive. The concept of Predator is original and brilliant because the alien is looking for big game hunting and skinning humans and wanting trophies the same way humans do when humans are hunting animals and in this film the concept of hunting is turned on it's head. The use of the Central American jungle is great and adds to the films dread and dark atmosphere because when the characters are in the jungle you'll feel like it goes on forever and that there is no way out and it's the end for the characters. You feel that none of the characters are safe. The hot temperature and sweating adds to the film as well because it's very realistic and you will feel like you're in a hot oven or heater and want to get out and scream at the top of your lungs. And speaking of the characters,despite their strong arms and toughness they a little depth and you feel for the characters and the plight that they go through whether it's dealing with the heat,the Predator,getting out of the jungle or trying to stay alive. The Action in the film is excellent because it builds up thanks to the suspense of most of the scenes and the tension element involved and when the film's tension stops the Action explodes like a bomb and the Action comes fast like a quick punch in the face and you never know what hit you. It's some of the best Action scenes in the 80s and of all-time. The Predator Alien is one of the greatest creatures in the history of cinema and I think one of reasons he's a great Alien and creature is because he's not like other Alien creatures. The Predator isn't trying to take over the world or possess a human body,he's just a hunter and a dangerous killer looking for trophies to take back to his planet. The Predator stalks his prey with smarts and a great use of his weapons. What's also great about the Predator in this film is that we don't see much until the very end which is a smart thing because it adds to the mystery of The Predator and I think makes the Predator more frightening. The Predator is such an amazing creature and when you first see him you will never forget him. The final 30 minutes of this film is a powerful and truly flawless execution of Action and white hot Suspense and is so intense that you will probably want to watch it again because the ending is very exciting and explosive. It is a truly amazing,thrilling and brilliant conclusion to this amazing movie one of the many reasons Predator is a classic.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent as Dutch,with Schwarzenegger bringing depth and charisma to the role. Carl Weathers is wonderful as Dillon,Dutch's friend and army buddy. Elpidia Carrillo does a great job as Anna,a girl that's captured by the commandos then helps them out. Bill Duke is menacing and intense as Mac. Jesse Ventura gives a fun and entertaining performance as Blain,the tobacco eating,big armed soldier. Sonny Landham gives a great,intense performance as Billy,a man of few words. Richard Graves is wonderful as Poncho. Shane Black does a good job as Hawkins,a guy who tells a good dirty joke. R.G. Armstrong gives a fine performance as General Phillips. The late great Kevin Peter Hall is brilliant as The Predator,using excellent body language and movements with his eyes and head. His performances in Predator 1 and 2 will live on forever. R.I.P Kevin Peter Hall.The direction by John McTierman is brilliant,with McTierman constantly moving the camera and using great angles,giving the film a excellent energy and fast pace. McTierman also does an amazing with the Action scenes and does with great intensity. Great job,McTierman.The score by Alan Silvestri is masterful,intense,dark and suspenseful and definitely adds to the greatness of the film. A great score. There's also a great use of the classic Long Tall Sally by Little Richard.The special make-up effects with The Predator creature by the late great effects artist Stan Winston is amazing and iconic and right next to the Terminator films this is his best work. R.I.P Stan Winston.In final word,if you love Action films,Sci-Fi films or Schwarzenegger films,I highly suggest you see Predator,a landmark Action classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,3,19 March 2013
Man of Steel," A Excellent Thrilling Action-Packed Superhero Film. The Best Superman Film Since Superman I And II.
","Man Of Steel is am excellent thrilling Action-Packed Superhero hero film and the best Superman film since Superman I and II. Filled with excellent direction,a great cast and amazing special effects,Man Of Steel is a great Superhero film that is worth your time.Man Of Steel tells the story of Clark Kent(Henry Cavill),a young man who discovers that he is an alien from the destroyed planet Krypton and has super human size and strength and uses his powers to help the human beings on earth. Clark soon finds out that the earth is going to be invaded by General Zod(Michael Shannon),an evil leader from Krypton. With the help of Newspaper reporter Lois Lane(Amy Adams),Clark now has to figure out how to destroy General Zod and save Earth.Man Of Steel is an excellent Superhero film that reinvents and many way relaunches American and Comic icon Superman. After the brilliance of Superman:The Movie and it's excellent sequel Superman II,the franchise fell apart after the sequels Superman III and Superman IV:The Quest For Peace were released. Bryan Singer's Superman Returns while a good movie received a lukewarm reception from fans. Now,outcomes Man Of Steel a film directed by Zack Snyder(300,Watchmen)and produced by Christopher Nolan(The Dark Knight Trilogy)which chooses to re-tell the story of Superman and giving us the best Superman film since Superman:The Movie and Superman II. Man Of Steel is an amazing Superhero film that will have you glued to the screen from beginning to end a film that works as a Superhero film,an Action film,disaster film,origin story and a great character study and if you are a fan of Superman you will love this film. What is great about Man Of Steel is the way the film tells story with the film and the Superman character because while Man Of Steel is basically giving viewers the very same origin story as Superman:The Movie the origin in this film told in a much darker and serious tone then in the other Superman films taking away the humor and light tone that is often associated with Superman and does with this film what Christopher Nolan did with The Dark Knight Trilogy whether it's in the photography or visual style and know many critics have panned the film for being dark and lack of Humor(although MOS has some Humor) but I like that the film gives us a different take on Superman. The Clark Kent/Superman character in this film is a lot different from the other portrayal in other Superman films because Kent in this film is dark, complex,gritty and has issues whether it's dealing with his powers,his parents or trying figure out who he really is and why he is on earth and the way the Clark Kent character is shown is powerful,sad and unforgettable. In MOS Clark is given an darkness and sadness showing that while Clark has great strength and power Clark isn't always proud to use it because the thing is Clark Kent/Superhero only uses the power when he needs to use it and this is one of things that gives MOS great depth. I also loved how Lois Lane was portrayed in the film because while she does scream and get into trouble she is still tough and can handle herself. The relationship between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois is real and honest you as the viewer feel that the two like and respect each other. The film at 2 hours and 24 minutes moves at a great pace and wonderful Action and character driven dialog. The Action and fight scenes in MOS is amazing and are truly breathtaking with each scene becoming much more intense and your jaw drops with each Action scene with the great special effects and fights that seem like they will go on forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and if you love the character Superman or are viewing this film the ending is a great cap off and put smiles on viewers faces.The cast does wonderful jobs in their roles. Henry Cavill is excellent as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El,with Cavill bringing depth,grit and toughness to the role. Amy Adams is great as Lois Lane showing toughness and beauty in the performance with Adams also having great chemistry with Cavill. Michael Shannon is brilliant as General Zod,with Shannon stealing every scene he's in. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are fantastic and sympathetic as Martha and Jonathan Kent,Clark adoptive parents. Russell Crowe is wonderful as Jor-El,Clark's real father. Laurence Fishburne(Perry White),Harry Lennix(General Swanwick),Antjie Traue(Faora-Ul),Ayelet Zurer(Lara Lor-Van),Richard Schiff(Dr.Emil Hamiliton)and Christopher Meloni(Colonel Nathan Hardy)give good performances as well.The direction by Zack Snyder is excellent,with Snyder using great angles and wide shots and giving the film a great visual style while doing a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Great job,Snyder.The score by Hans Zimmer is incredible,powerful and intense and matches the tone of this film. Wonderful score,Zimmer.In final word,if you love Superman,Zack Snyder,Christopher Nolan,Action films,Superhero films or Comic Book films,I highly suggest you see Man Of Steel,a great Superhero/Action film that will blow you away. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,6,13,15 June 2013
The Thing," A Flawless Horror Classic. Carpenter's Greatest Film.
","John Carpenter's The Thing is in my opinion the Greatest horror film ever made. A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and killing them and imitating them. Which raises the question:Who can you trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly brilliant and why I love The Thing. The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role. T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history. Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's greatest film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,6,9,27 May 2012
The Shining," One Of The Greatest Horror Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Scary,Frightening,Terrifying,Unforgettable Horror Masterpiece From Stanley Kubrick.
","Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,a scary,terrifying,frightening and unforgettable Masterpiece of Horror and cinema in general. Filled with masterful direction,brilliant acting and haunting images,The Shining is one of the greatest films ever made and Kubrick at his best.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name,The Shining tells the story of Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson),a writer and former teacher who is also a recovering alcoholic who has been asked to be the caretaker of The Overlook Hotel in Colorado from the Winter until May the 1st. Bringing along his wife Wendy(Shelley Duvall)and his psychic son Danny(Danny Lloyd),the Torrance family discover that they are not alone in the hotel and are being stalked by ghosts who are making Jack go insane and possessing him to kill his family. Will Wendy and Danny make it out alive or face Jack and the hotel ghosts wrath? The Shining is without a doubt one of the greatest Horror films ever made that from the moment you watch it is an instant Masterpiece and Classic right from the opening credits. The Shining is not only a Masterpiece of modern Horror,but also a Masterpiece of timeless Horror. Kubrick has given viewers a big,bold and epic Horror film that right from the start of the film you watching a living nightmare that is scary and unsettling,dark and horrific,disturbing and unforgettable with haunting imagery that will unnerve viewers. One of the main reasons The Shining is scary and Horrific is the creepy atmosphere that the film conveys. The cold and snowy atmosphere gives the film a sense of dread and fear and makes not only the characters but the viewers feel alone,isolated and trapped and there is no way out. The snow and cold gives the film a unsettling feeling where you think that anything can happen at anytime. This film and John Carpenter's The Thing both use cold and snow atmosphere to great effect and will make viewers never stay alone in the snow and cold ever again. When Kubrick shows the inside of The Overlook Hotel,the Hotel is big and wide and given a lot of space feeling like The Hotel is a character in itself and as the film goes on the Hotel becomes more of a character and Jack,Wendy and Danny become claustrophobic and alone. The lighting and sound is what makes The Shining stand out from other ghost films because the lighting makes The Shining look beautiful and frightening in it's darkness. The use of sound in the film is effective whether it's the wood on the floor,music or the sound of doors. The sound effects throughout the film give viewers a sense of fear and terror and put you in a scary place. The imagery and visuals in the film are creepy and will stick with you because of it's power and intensity because what Kubrick is giving us is a visceral experience of trying frighten us not only physically but mentally as well. The Shining transcends the Ghost and Haunted house genre by making the film ambiguous because as you watch the film you wonder why are the ghosts there? Are the ghosts there because of the Hotel or are they there because of Jack going crazy or is it because Jack,Wendy and Danny have Cabin Fever? The movie makes you ask a lot of questions that are not answered and is one of the reasons The Shining is a great movie. With the characters Jack,Wendy and Danny we are sorry for them but also scared for them before anything really starts to happen because we as the viewers can tell that the Torrance family has problems but still love each other. When scary starts to happen you are with the Torrance family as if though you are experiencing the terror yourself and that is the power that this film has. As loved as The Shining is now,the film is still controversial among Kubrick fans and Stephen King fans. As a Kubrick film The Shining is seen as a brilliant masterpiece and one of his best,but as a King adaptation King fans hate the film and consider the film to be a bad version of the novel. As someone who is a fan of both Kubrick and King I think both the novel and film are both brilliant but on different levels. The ending of the film is masterful and will leave you with a lot of questions and will have you discussing what happened. A great ending.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Jack Nicholson is excellent,terrifying,funny and over the top as Jack Torrence,with Nicholson bringing intensity to the role. Shelley DuVall is brilliant as Wendy,Jack's wife,with Duvall bringing sympathy and depth to the role. Danny Lloyd(in his only film role)is wonderful as Danny,Jack and Wendy's son who has great psychic abilities. Scatman Crothers is great in his small role as Dick Hollorann,the hotel cook who knows about Danny's power. Phillip Stone is creepy and memorable as Delbert Grady,one of the ghosts Jack meets. Barry Nelson(Stuart Ullman),Joe Turkel(Lloyd The Bartender),Anne Jackson(Doctor),Tony Burton(Larry Durkin)and Barry Dennen(Bill Watson)give good performances as well.The direction by Stanley Kubrick is excellent and masterful,with Kubrick using tracking shots,over the head camera angles,zooms and close-ups giving a frightening and scary atmosphere. Powerful direction by Kubrick.The score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elind is brilliant,scary and terrifying and fits with the scary tone of the film. Great score. There is also a great use of the song Midnight,The Stars And You by Ray Noble Orchestra with Al Bowally.In final word,if you love Stanley Kubrick,Jack Nicholson,Horror Films,Ghost Films,Supernatural films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Shining,a brilliant Horror Masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made that you can watch again and again and belongs in every movie fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,4,24 May 2013
No Country for Old Men," A Brilliant,Flawless Masterpiece From The Coen Brothers And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made.
","No Country For Old Men is a flawless masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing acting,great direction,a wonderful screenplay and memorable characters. This is one of the Coen Brothers best films,one of my all-time favorite films and one of the greatest films ever made.Based on Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name and set in West Texas in 1980,No Country For Old Men tells the story of a hunter named Lleweyln Moss(Josh Brolin)who comes across a drug deal gone bad and finds two million dollars in a briefcase. Even though he has the money,Lleweyln knows he's not safe and has to find a way out while being tracked by a dangerous hit-man named Anton Chigurh(Jarvier Bardem),local county sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones)and Mexican drug dealers all leading up to a violent and bloody chase and cat and mouse game.NCFOM is a masterpiece that works not just as Crime Thriller,but,also works as a Coen Brothers film,character study,the study on the themes of life,death and fate and as a Contemporary Western. What I love about NCFOM is that while it is a Coen Brothers film,at times it doesn't feel like one because of the way the Coens approach the story. Unlike most of the Coens films,where violence and chaos are done with loud sounds and a music score,this film has a very quiet and somber demeanor,giving us a world of the Texas landscape where violence and chaos is almost silent and unheard and where no character is safe. The Action and Violence in the film are well-done with suspense and intensity and the fact that there is no music during the Action scenes adds to the film's greatness and puts you on the edge of your seat. The Action and violence in the film is bloody and dark and will disturb you to the core. The screenplay by The Coens is excellent,adapting McCarthy's dialog word for word right out of the book,with The Coens still bringing some of their signature style and sense of humor and wit to the script. The movie is a great character study as well,with the three main character Ed Tom,Anton and Llewelyn in the forefront. The three main characters are well-developed and memorable,each of them having great scenes on their own and as the film goes on you understand their motivations,who they are and who they're about,whether it's Llewelyn and the money,Anton Chigurh and his pursuit of the money and Ed Tom reactions to the things he sees all around him. What sets NCFOM from other crime Thrillers is the film's study of Life,death and fate. Life,death and fate seem to either effect or goes with the characters,with Anton Chigurh who is basically a physical representation of death and fate. Chigurh strongly believes in fate and uses a coin to find out whether you die or not,if you guess heads or tails,one or the other right,you live,if you don't you will die at the hands of Chigurh. The gas station scene in the film will show you. Where Llewelyn is trying to defend himself from violence and death,Sheriff Ed Tom just doesn't understand why there's violence all around and why the times are changing all around him,with drugs,guns and death in the air. Ed Tom represents the past where old time sheriff's didn't have to use a gun or deal with violence,the future in this film is drugs,guns,death and the real danger and Horror of violence,something that Ed Tom Bell doesn't understand and can't figure out why it's happening and there is a sadness and dread that hangs over the film with Ed Tom and the title No Country For Old Men refers to him. NCFOM is also a modern Western in many respects and while we don't see any stagecoaches and six-shooters,you will see characters riding horses and wearing cowboy hats and Roger Deakins beautiful photography shows viewers the dust and dirt of West Texas making look beautiful and nice during the day while making the film dark and eerie at night. The ending of the film will divide viewers and will fall into two categories people who love the ending or who will hate the ending,I fall into the former category because the Coens while staying true to their vision,also stay true to the vision of McCarthy's novel offering viewers a powerful and unforgettable conclusion that doesn't end with a bang,but with a whimper and one of the reasons NCFOM is a Masterpiece.The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Josh Brolin is does a great job as Llewelyn Moss bringing a grit and toughness to the role. Jarvier Bardem is brilliant as Anton Chigurh,one of the best villains in movie history. Bardem is frightening,scary and menacing and doesn't try to be scary,he just is. Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell,bringing a quiet,somber and sometimes dry humor to the performance. Woody Harrelson does good job as Carson Wells,an associate of Anton Chigurh. Kelly Macdonald does a fine job as Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean Moss and considering Macdonald's Scottish in real life does a good job with the Texas accent. Garret Dillahunt(Wendell),Tess Harper(Loretta Bell),Barry Corbin(Ellis),Stephen Root(Man who hires Wells)and Beth Grant(Carla Jean's Mother)give fine performances as well.The Coen Brothers(Joel and Ethan)direction in the film is excellent and the Coens give the film great pace and timing,while giving film a great since of atmosphere and tone,always moving the camera. Brilliant direction Joel and Ethan.The score by Carter Burwell is rarely heard in the film,but when in use is effective and fits with the mood of the film. Fine score.In final word,if you love Crime Thrillers,Drama,character study's,Western,The Coen Brothers,Cormac McCarthy or cinema,I suggest you see No Country For Old Men,an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and is one of The Coen Brothers Best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.j",10,6,6,15 January 2013
Batman Begins," One Of The Best Comic Book/Superhero Films Ever Made. A Great Start To A Excellent Trilogy.
","Batman Begins is one of the best Comic Book/Superhero films ever made and a landmark film in the Superhero/Comic Book genre. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and amazing Action scenes this is Christopher Nolan at his best.Set in the fictional town of Gotham City,Batman Begins tells the story of a young billionaire Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)who as a little boy saw his parents killed in a mugging and is scarred. When Bruce grows up and sees Gotham ravaged by Crime and death,Bruce decides to become a masked crime fighter and calls himself Batman. Now,Batman has to battle and stop the villain know as Scarecrow/Dr. Jonathan Crane(Cillian Murphy)while the same trying to save Gotham.Batman Begins is a great Comic Book film that brought Batman back to the dark and brooding character he was. At first when I heard that Warner Brothers was making a new,rebooted Batman film I was not to excited mainly because I loved Tim Burton's Batman films and I thought the series should not be relaunched. But after Joel Shumacher's campy and candy colored films Batman Forever(which is not that bad)and Batman & Robin(no comment on that film)Batman and the Batman series was saved an rebooted by Christopher Nolan with Batman Begins and with this film gave us a great start to The Dark Knight Trilogy. What separates this film from other Batman films is that BB shows how Bruce Wayne became Batman and the complexity of the character Bruce Wayne. Nolan's film shows viewers how Bruce Wayne became Batman with years of training and building up to becoming a crime fighter with weapons,fighting skills and striking fear in the hearts of the criminals who roam the streets of Gotham City. Bruce trains as Batman in not only the physical and fighting advantage but also the mental advantage by using the dark and shadows. Nolan also shows Bruce Wayne trying to balance out being Batman and Billionaire Bruce Wayne and showing that while Wayne is grown up is still affected by the murders of his parents. BB also shows viewers trying to form and reform relationships because of Bruce's isolation from the city and it's people. What I also love about BB and The Dark Knight Trilogy as a whole is how realistic they are and that while they are Comic Book films they don't feel like Comic Book films. Nolan bought a realism and grittiness to Comic Book/Superhero film that had not been seen much with Nolan giving us a world where Batman could exist in the real world without question and the things that happened in the film are not fantasy but reality. The realistic style of The Dark Knight Trilogy has been imitated since. I also liked how Gotham City looks and is portrayed in this film because it is not the dark and Gothic look of the Burton films or the candy colored campy look of the Schumacher films but a realistic world a Film-Noir world where Gotham is surrounded by cloud,smoke and rain and where criminals rule the streets and it feels real and makes you feel like you are in Gotham. Gotham would play a much bigger part in the other two films. Nolan is a master at pacing a film and BB moves at a great pace and when you watch the movie you would think the film was 90 minutes rather than 140 minutes. The Action and fight sequences are well-done by Nolan and match the tone of the film and Nolan would raise the Action and fight scenes to greater heights in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. The ending of the film is great and Nolan shows viewers that with BB Nolan was just warming up and would give us much bigger,larger and more ambitious films in The Dark Knight Saga.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent as Batman/Bruce Wayne,with Bale bringing a depth and complex personality to the role. Michael Caine is wonderful as Alfred,Bruce's longtime Butler and friend. Caine has great scenes and chemistry with Bale. Liam Neeson is fabulous in his role as Ducard,a man who trains Bruce. Katie Holmes does a good job as Rachel,Bruce's best friend and love interest. Gary Oldman is great as always in the role of Cop Jim Gordan,a cop who helps Batman. Cillain Murphy is creepy and menacing as the Dr. Crane/Scarecrow,Batman's opponent. Tom Wilkinson is fantastic as Carmine Falcone,a Gotham City crime boss. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Lucius Fox,Bruce's weapon and car maker. Rutger Hauer is good and memorable as Earle,an employee at Wayne corporations. Ken Watanabe is wonderfully mysterious as Ra's Al Ghul,Ducard's boss and associate. Mark Boone Junior is memorable as Flass,Gordan's corrupt partner.The direction by Christopher Nolan is excellent,with Nolan giving the film an intense and dark visual style constantly moving the camera with over head shots while Nolan also does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction from Nolan.The score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is brilliant and epic and matches the dark and visual tone of the film. A great score by Zimmer and Howard.In final word,if you a fan of Christopher Nolan,Batman,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Batman Begins,one of the best Comic Book films ever made and a great start to a brilliant trilogy. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,1,1 May 2013
JFK," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful,Unforgettable Masterpiece From Oliver Stone.
","JFK is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,a terrific all-star cast,a wonderful script and a brilliant and intense film score. All of those elements make JFK a classic political Thriller/Mystery,an outstanding piece of cinema and Oliver Stone at his best.Based on the books On The Trail Of The Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire:The Plot That Killed Kennedy,JFK tells the story of Jim Garrison(Kevin Costner),a New Orleans District Attorney who is investigating the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy that happened on November 22,1963. While some think it was just Lee Harvey Oswald(Gary Oldman)alone that did the shooting,Garrison thinks that there was others involved and that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy and Jim Garrison is investigating the events that lead up to the assassination.Released in 1991,JFK is an amazing film that was controversial even before was released into movie theaters and is still one of the most controversial films of all time because some critics and the media felt that director Oliver Stone was taking liberties with historical facts and events. Whether anyone will see the film as fact or fiction,JFK is a brilliant film on every level,a thought-provoking masterpiece that punches you in the face right from the beginning grabbing you by the throat and never letting viewers go until the very end and is a movie that is an assault on the senses and the mind. JFK is also an intense Mystery-Thriller and one of the best Mystery-Thrillers ever made that is filled with intensity and with white hot suspense with questions about the John F. Kennedy Assassination,a tragic event that changed America in 1963. The beauty of JFK is that Kennedy's death is seen as an unsolved mystery not about who killed President Kennedy,but why was Kennedy killed,who really benefited,who has the power to cover it up? Was the Kennedy Assassination a conspiracy? Did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone or were there others? Were the United States Federal Government,FBI,CIA and Mob involved? The movie in a frightening way asks these questions but instead of answering them JFK lets viewers answer these questions themselves and the movie messes with you not just physically but mentally as well because the whole entire film is like a giant puzzle or riddle and we as the viewer are trying to put pieces together. JFK is an epic film in the truest sense with a running time of 3 hrs and 9 minutes but it is the fastest three and a half hours you will ever watch and you are never bored or tired. What I love about JFK is the non linear style the film has using flashbacks with some of the characters telling different stories with multiple camera styles to keep the story moving and going nonstop. The screenplay by Zachary Skyler and Oliver Stone is fantastic and powerful with Skyler and Stone giving the movie dialog and scenes that are dramatic and tight and at times feels like a Shakespearean tragedy. The main character Jim Garrison is not only the hero of JFK but he also represents the audience because like Jim Garrison we are investigating why John F. Kennedy was killed and who was behind the assassination and as Garrison goes in deep into the investigation Garrison begins to lose his idealism and the way he used to feel about the law and government before the assassination opening his eyes and realizing white is black and black is white. Although Garrison investigating the case is affecting his personal life with his family,he still loves his family and wants to protect them while still wanting to solve the John F. Kennedy killing never wanting to stop no matter what. Jim Garrison is a fascinating and memorable character and we root for Garrison all the way for wanting to find out the truth. The ending is amazing because even though it is a conclusion It feels like the investigation into John F. Kennedy assassination will go on forever and it will either be solved or remained unsolved with the real truth still being out there. A terrific ending.The whole cast is amazing. Kevin Costner is excellent and gives the best performance of his career as Jim Garrison,with Costner bringing power,depth and heroic quality to the role. Tommy Lee Jones is terrific as Clay Shaw,a New Orleans business man implicated in the assassination. Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lee Harvey Oswald,the killer and assassin of John F. Kennedy. Joe Pesci is fiery and memorable as David Ferrie,a friend of Clay Shaw's. Kevin Bacon shines as Willie O'Keefe,a male prostitute and friend of David's. Donald Sutherland is fantastic as Mr. X,a former colonial giving Garrison information. Sissy Spacek is great as Liz Garrison,Jim's wife. Jack Lemmon(Jack Martin),Ed Asner(Guy Bannister),Michael Rooker(Bill),Jay O. Sanders(Lou),Laurie Metcalf(Susie),John Candy(Dean Andrews Jr),Walter Matthau(Russell B. Long),Brian Doyle-Murray(Jack Ruby),Wayne Knight(Numa),Beata Pozniak(Marina Oswald),Sally Kirkland(Rose Cheramie)and Vincent D'Onofrio(Bill Newman,eyewitness)give great performances as well.The direction by Oliver Stone is brilliant and stylish,with Stone always moving the camera showing close-ups,visual stunning shots that use Black and white to great effect and give the film a documentary feel keep the movie going at a quick pace. Wonderful direction,Stone.The score by John Williams is outstanding,powerful and intense,with Williams' score being epic,heroic and suspenseful matching the film's tone to perfection.

Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,4,14,24 January 2014
Django Unchained," An Excellent And Unforgettable Epic Western. Another Tarantino Classic.
","Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is an excellent,brutal and bloody Western and is an instant classic. Filled with great dialog,great direction,memorable characters and stylish Action,Django Unchained is not only a Western Classic,but a Tarantino classic.Set in 1858,two years before the Civil Wat,Django Unchained tells the story of a Black slave named Django(Jamie Foxx)who is freed and rescued from a dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz(Christoph Waltz). After being freed,Django teams up with Schultz and becomes a bounty hunter. While they're doing well with their bounty hunting,Django and Schultz set their sights on rescuing Django's wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington)from a charming,yet sadistic plantation owner named Calvin Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio). Rescuing Broomhilda from Calvin isn't going to be easy for Django and Schultz and it will lead to a bloody,brutal and surprising climax.Django Unchained is a brilliant film because,despite it's subject matter,the films works because of Tarantino's take on the Western,the main characters,the dialog,showing the horrors of slavery and it's stylish violence. One of the things that I love about Django Unchained is that Quentin Tarantino has basically brought a Spaghetti Western film into the modern film world,giving viewers a film where everyone and everything is exaggerated and over the top and it's done in a harsh,stylized and darkly humorous way.Tarantino brings the same surreal and stylized feel that he brought to Inglourious Basterds and his recent films,showing viewers not a realistic world,but a Tarantino world where anything can happen and they're no questions. DU is epic in terms of the way it's filmed and length(165 minutes)but it never drags or slows down and the film is told in two half,the half when Django and Schultz are bounty hunting and the second half when the duo meets Calvin Candie and like I.B the film builds up to a violent conclusion. DU is to the Western genre like I.B was to WW2 films. The characters in the film are memorable and unforgettable,especially the characters Django and Schultz who are likable and are cool,charming and have a good chemistry together and as the film goes on you start to relate to them and understand who they are and what their motivations are. Unlike the characters Django and Schultz who are likable,the character Calvin Candie,while charming,is just pure evil and horrifying. From the moment Calvin steps on the screen he is so distasteful and unlikable that you feel that there is no redeemable quality in this character or has a touch of sympathy in him. Calvin loves to treat his slaves like dirt and loves to instill pain and fear onto his slaves and has no remorse for what he does. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliantly written and filled with great scenes of funny dialog and moments of dark humor that will have you laughing and stick with you after the film is over with the best scenes and dialog with Django,Schultz and Calvin Candie. As great as the film is,DU will also divide viewers because of the themes of slavery and use of the N-word. Slavery is a heavy subject to tackle with and Tarantino doesn't hold back on the Horrors of slavery,showing the pain,fright and violence blacks went through during the times of slavery and sometimes it's hard to watch. The use of the N-word will offend people as well,but as viewer it doesn't really bother me because I believe Tarantino was just being truthful about the time period of slavery and blacks having to deal with racism being called the N-word most of the time. While most of the film is definitely a fantasy,Tarantino takes time to bring lots of reality to the film. The Action and Violence in the film,like other Tarantino films, is well-done,over the top and bloody done with rapid fire intensity and brilliance. At times when a person gets shot,you'll feel the pain and sees lots blood and feel like your in the movie. The ending of the film is masterful and explosive with violence and bloodshed that will have you cheering and laughing at the destruction of the film and will have you rooting for Django and one of the reasons Django Unchained is a classic.The whole cast does an excellent job. Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django(the 'D' is silent). Foxx brings a toughness,grit and a iconic presence to the role. Christoph Waltz is brilliant Dr. King Schultz,bringing a coolness and clever glee to the performance. Foxx and Waltz's scenes together are great and the actors have great chemistry together. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an outstanding,delightful and over the top performance as Calvin Candie. DiCaprio's brings a terrifying,funny and disgusting presence to the role and is unforgettable. Calvin Candie ranks alongside I.B's Hans Landa as one of the great Tarantino villains. Kerry Washington is wonderful as Broomhilda,Django's wife,with Washington bring depth to the role. Samuel L. Jackson is great and funny as Stephen,Calvin's loyal house slave. Next to Calvin,Stephen will probably be the most hated character in the film. Also lookout for cameos by Don Johnson(Big Daddy),Franco Nero(the actor who played the unconnected Django in the 60s),Jonah Hiil,James Remar,Bruce Dern,Michael Parks,Dennis Christopher,Walton Goggins(Billy Crash),Quentin Tarantino himself and many more.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is masterful using great camera angles,zoom-ins and close-ups and giving the film a great style.The Western and Action standoffs are excellent and well-executed by Tarantino as well. Great direction,Quentin.I love the soundtrack in the film,especially the Django theme song by Franco Migliacci,Luis Enriquez and Rocky Roberts.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Westerns,Action or Cinema in general,I suggest you see Django Unchained a true classic of the Western genre and one of Tarantino's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,3,12,27 December 2012
The Mist," One Of The Best Horror Films Ever Made. Frank Darabont and Stephen King at their best.
","The Mist is one of the best Horror films ever made that works as a Horror Film,Monster Movie,and Character drama. Terrifying,bleak,and filled with hopelessness,The Mist is a Horror classic and one of the best Stephen King adaptations with a stunning ending you will never forget.Based on Stephen King's novella,The Mist tells the story about people in a small Maine town who are trapped in a supermarket when a huge mist surrounds the market and town unleashing deadly creatures from the mist that attack and kill people. Now the people in the supermarket have to figure out how to survive the mist and creatures and stay alive.One of the many things I love about The Mist is that not only is it a monster movie,it's a great commentary on people and society when things fall apart. The film is filled with a sense of dread and darkness that you don't see in many Horror films these days because most Horror films that come out these days are glossy and pretty. The Mist is not glossy or pretty,it's an ugly nightmarish film that makes you feel like you're in the film and with the characters good or bad. Claustrophobia is always an important element in a Horror film and the claustrophobic setting inside the supermarket is put to great use in this film. When the people are the supermarket in the beginning of the film,you feel safe and secure,but when The Mist and creatures arrive,you feel the walls are closing in on the characters and that they're trapped. As a you're watching the movie,you feel like the characters are isolated from the world and that The Mist had taken over making the viewers feel like they're in a apocalypse of doom,death and darkness. Probably the most frightening thing about The Mist is that not only the creatures that come out of the mist but the humans inside the market. When the mist comes it not only becomes a great horror film or monster film,but a great character drama,focusing on how the characters react to the situation and how they deal with it and this is one of the things that sets The Mist apart from other modern Horror films. Instead of fighting the monsters and helping each other out,most of the people start to turn on each other and become divided into groups becoming monsters themselves attacking and killing each other when ever they can. The Mist and Frank Darabont gives us a terrifying study of human nature and that human beings will be responsible for their own self destruction and the way the human characters act in the film is haunting,disturbing and scary. I have a feeling the late,great Rod Serling would've loved The Mist because the film reminds me of The Twilight Zone especially classic Twilight Zone episodes The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street and The Shelter. At 126 minutes,The Mist moves at a fast and rapid fire pace and never slows down until the very end. The film's screenplay by Frank Darabount is great and stays true to Stephen King's novella with scenes and dialog that are from the book with a few differences and a little minor alterations. The ending of the film is one of the boldest, greatest,jaw dropping and shocking endings in movie history. How Frank Darabont convinced the movie's studio to o.k the ending is stunning to me and it's one the reasons The Mist is a classic. I won't tell you how it ends but I'll you this:the ending in this film is not for people who love happy and uplifting endings,the ending is dark,tragic and very unforgettable. Not since John Carpenter's The Thing and George Romero's Night of the Living Dead has a Horror film ending been so bleak and hopeless. No matter how many times I've watched The Mist the ending still gets to me.The cast does a great job in their roles. Thomas Jane is excellent as David Drayton the man who tries to take charge when things are falling apart. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant as religious zealot Mrs Carmody,not only one of the best villains in a Stephen King film or book,but in my opinion one of the best villains in film history. Harden's performance is absolutely bone chilling and disturbing and Oscar worthy. A brilliant performance. Laurie Holden does a great job as Amanda,a woman who helps out and sides with David. Andre Braughter is fantastic as Brent,a lawyer who is skeptical about the events and doesn't believe the things that are happening. Toby Jones is wonderful as Ollie a store clerk who becomes a man of Action. Darabont regulars William Sadler(Jim)and Jeffrey DeMunn(Dan)are great as always in their roles. Frances Sternhagen(Mrs Reppler),Nathan Gamble(Billy Drayton),Alexa Davalos(Sally),Chris Owen(Norm),Sam Witwer(Private Jessep),Robert Treveiler(Bud)and David Jensen(Myron) do fine jobs in their roles as well. If you're a fan of the TV show The Walking Dead you will see a few of the actors(Laurie Holden,Jeffery DeMunn,Melissa McBride) who are on the show. Frank Darabont's direction is fantastic bringing a gritty and dark tone to the film. In the other Stephen King films The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile Darabont's direction and lighting were bright,clean and straight forward,but in The Mist the direction and lighting are chaotic and dark and intense with Darabont using hand-held photography and a semi-documentary feel to the film almost feels like an independent movie. Great direction from Darabont.Mark Isham's score while not used much is effective fits with the film's dark tone. Dead Can Dance's song The Host Of Seraphim is haunting and eerie and blends wonderfully with the films tragic and sad ending. It's a song that will stay with you.In final word,The Mist is a Horror classic that will stay with you after watching it and if you love Horror,Frank Darabont,or Stephen King see this film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,7,14,27 October 2012
Kick-Ass," An Excellent,Action-Packed,Hilarious,Over The Top Superhero Action-Comedy And One Of The Best Superhero Films Ever Made.
","Kick-Ass is an excellent,entertaining and hilarious Superhero/Comic Book film that's filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,amazing Action,laugh out loud Comedy and a great score and soundtrack makes Kick-Ass one of the best Superhero films ever made and a Cult Classic.Based on the Comic Book by Mark Miller and John Romita Jr. and Set in New York City,Kick-Ass tells the story of teenager Dave Lizewski,an outcast who has nothing in his life going for except for his love for Comic Books and Superheros. Dave's love for Comic Books and Superheros inspire Dave to become a crime fighter and calling himself Kick-Ass and becomes a sensation. However,when Kick-Ass angers local crime boss Frank D'Amico(Mark Strong),D'Amico wants Kick-Ass dead. Now,with the help of other crime fighters Hit-Girl(Chloe Grace Moretz)and her Father Big Daddy(Nicolas Cage),Kick-Ass has to stop D'Amico and end come out on top.Kick-Ass is a brilliant,Action-packed and funny superhero film that wears it's over the top spirit on it's sleeve and gives viewers a film that mocks and reconstructs the Superhero genre and a movie that is violent,hilarious and offbeat and a true Cult Classic. One of the main reasons Kick-Ass is a great movie is that it takes the Superhero Comic Book genre and turns it on it's head taking aim at classic and iconic Superheros such as Batman,Superman and Spider-Man and the film's that associated with them taking all of the trademarks and familiar things and giving them a demented twist that is funny and stylish. Imagine the movie Watchmen if it was a Black Comedy. The Comedy and Humor is truly hilarious and done with a dark satirical glee that goes so over the top that you never know what's going to happen next whether it's with the film's characters or the violence and you as the viewer are pulled into a bizarre world where anything can and will happen. The Action and fight scenes in the film are fantastic and flawlessly executed with great skill and detail and fits in with the film's wild Comic Book energy. The violence is bloody and brutal but done in a funny way. While Kick-Ass takes place in a realistic setting the look of the film has a Surrealistic Comic Book style and look throughout the film with bright colors such as red,green and blue almost a Comic Book coming to life on the screen and it's just beautiful and visually stunning to look at. The screenplay by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman is just amazing and fresh with great dialog that is truly memorable and stylish and at the same time funny and quotable with very interesting characters that will stay in your mind after you have watched it. The film's main characters Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl are amazing,memorable characters that are fascinating to watch because of who they are and how different the two are from each other. Kick-Ass is a remarkable character because he is not like other Comic Book crime fighters or Superheros because Dave Lizweski(Kick-Ass' alter ego)does not become the hero Kick-Ass for the sake of revenge or because of something awful happening to his parents,Dave is just and awkward teenage kid who just wanted to be Kick-Ass because he wanted to know what it is like to be a Superhero and fight crime. And while Kick-Ass does not always succeed in kicking ass like much better and superior Superheros, Kick-Ass believes in what he's doing and you applaud him for what he tries to do even if he fails more than he succeeds. While the character Kick-Ass called himself Kick-Ass but in my opinion the real Kick-Ass was Hit-Girl. Hit-Girl is such an amazing character because despite Hit-Girl being 11 years old and a little bit small she can fight with anybody anytime and can handle herself without hesitation or doubt,using either guns,knives or her own fists. Where as Kick-Ass just became a crime fighter with no fighting skills,Hit-Girl was taught to fight criminals by her crime fighter Father Big Daddy so Hit-Girl can learn how to handle herself when she's all alone with the criminals. Hit-Girl is a character you will remember after watching the film. The most talked about and controversial thing about Kick-Ass is Hit-girl's use of harsh language and violence that she does in the film which will offend most viewers. And while I admit the cursing from Hit-Girl is shocking at times it does not offend me and I find Hit-Girl cursing funny because it's in the context of Comedy and the surreal Comic Book universe. The ending of Kick-Ass is amazing and Action-packed and will leave viewers with a smile. A great ending.The whole cast is amazing. Aaron Johnson is excellent as Kick-Ass/Dave Lizewski,with Johnson bringing humor and likability to the role. Chloe Grace Mortez is brilliant as Hit-Girl/Mindy Macready,with Mortez bringing toughness,laughs and depth to the role. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fantastic and funny as Chris D'Amico/Red Mist,Frank D'Amico's son. Nicholas Cage is great and over the top as Big Daddy/Damon Macready,Hit-Girl/Mindy's Father. Mark Strong is amazing and hilarious as Frank D'Amico,a local crime boss. Lindsay Fonseca is wonderful and sexy as Katie,Dave's crush. Clarke Duke(Marty),Evan Peters(Todd),Omari Hardwick(Sergant Marcus Williams),Michael Rispoli(Big Joe),Stu Riley(Big Goon)and Yancy Butler(Angie D'Amico)give good performances as well.The direction by Matthew Vaughn is excellent and stylish,with Vaughn always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace,wonderful energy and visual style and also does a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Vaughn.The score by Marius De Vries,IIan Eshken,Henry Jackman and John Murphy is fantastic,epic and big and matches the tone of the film. A great score. There is also amazing songs on the soundtrack from Elvis Presley(Battle Hymm Of The Republic)The Dickies(Banana Splits),Joan Jett(Bad Reputation)and Ennio Morricone(For A Few Dollar More Theme).In final word,if you love Superhero Films,Comic Book films,Action films or Comedies,I highly suggest you see Kick-Ass,an Action-packed and hilarious Superhero film and Cult Classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,11,18,8 August 2013
Ghostbusters," An Excellent And Hilarious Classic That Brilliantly Mixes Comedy,SCI-FI And Supernatural Thrills.
","Ghostbusters is one of the funniest films of all time that combines a great cast,script and special effects mixing Comedy and the Supernatural to amazing effect that makes this film an all-time classic.Ghostbusters tells the story of three college professors Peter Venkman(Bill Murray),Ray Stantz(Dan Aykroyd)and Egon Spengler(Harold Ramis)who work in the field of the paranormal and psychology. When the trio is fired from the college campus,Peter,Ray,and Egon decide to set up their own business as Ghostbusters. While the Ghostbusters have their success,they'll soon have to deal with ghosts in an apartment building on central park west and these ghosts won't be easy to capture.Ghostbusters is a classic film because it balances different genres,a great script and unique special effects. I love genre mash-up films and Ghostbusters is one of my favorite mash-up films because like some of the best mash-up films Ghostbusters successfully mixes together very different movie genres to amazing effect throwing in everything but the kitchen sink but never becoming uneven or unfocused achieving it's goal in entertaining viewers with a classic that is hilarious,unforgettable and will be re-watchable for all times and generations. Comedy and the Supernatural blend well together in this film because of the great and memorable interactions of the main characters and the funny situations the characters go through. When the film is funny it remains funny and never slows down and when the film becomes suspenseful and spooky it works as well. When most films that mix together different genres and fail this one succeeds and succeeds with greatness and originality that has is masterful. Bill Murray,Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were among the biggest Comedy stars during the 80s and the three actors make the characters Peter,Ray and Egon memorable,likable and iconic. The pursuit of the Ghosts and their interactions with other characters as well as each other is great,you feel like the characters really believe in what they're doing,which is catching ghosts. Peter,Ray and Egon's banter, interactions,lines and various conversations with each other and other characters is hilarious and quotable,combining and mixing great laughs sarcasm,wit,smarts and sometimes deadpan Humor in the scenes. Most of the lines will be in you head after watching the film. Ghostbusters is also one few films to never spawn imitators,copycats or remakes. I guess the reason that never happened is because Ghostbusters is a unique film all it's own that can never be repeated or duplicated. One of the things I also love about Ghostbusters is that the film while it creates it's own world of Fantasy and Science Fiction it's still very much grounded in reality thanks to the characters and showing the city of New York and it's people as they love and embrace the Ghostbusters. The screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis is original,funny and genius writing great dialog that's memorable,well-written and smart and has scenes that are well-placed and timed and great. Mixing laughs and special effects isn't an easy task but Reitman,Aykroyd and Ramis balance it out where Comedy and special effects don't override each other. It's Saturday Night Live and National Lampoon meets Poltergeist. The only films that I can think that mix Comedy and special effects well is Ghostbusters 2 and the Back To The Future trilogy. The Action in the film is great and intense and during the Action scenes there is wonderful laughs and fantastic moments that will stick with fans and viewers. The special effects in the film are excellent and still hold up to this very day. It's obvious every cent on the special effects especially towards the end. I won't spoil it for you but the very big special effects shot at the end is one of the funniest and surprising endings in film history that will make your jaw drop and have you roar with laughter and is one of the main reasons Ghostbusters is a classic.The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Bill Murray is excellent and at his dead-pan best as Peter Venkman,the sarcastic,womanizing doctor who is smart and clever and Murray has some of the funniest lines in the film. Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as Ray Stantz,bringing a funny optimistic,child-like glee to the role. Sigourney Weaver does an amazing and sexy job as Dana Barrett,Venkman's love interest and has a great chemistry with Murray. Harold Ramis does a great job as Egon Spengler a scientist who's the straight man in the Ghostbusters. Rick Moranis is terrific and hilarious as Louis Tully,Dana's next door neighbor. Annie Potts is wonderful as Janine,the secretary of the Ghostbusters. William Atherton is great as Walter Peck,a representative of the Enivormental Protection Agency. Ernie Hudson does a fantastic job as Winston Zeddmore,the newest member of the Ghostbusters. David Margulies also does a fabulous job as Mayor Lenny,the Mayor of New York City.Ivan Reitman does a great job with the film,bringing a lot energy and imagination to the film. Reitman directs the Comedy well and also brings a sense of dread to the film when things get scary. Amazing direction,ReitmanElmer Bernstein's score is excellent at times very spooky,creepy and at other times lighthearted and optimistic. What a great score. And the soundtrack has great songs including the great iconic theme song Ghostbusters by Ray Parker Jr. Magic by Mick Smiley,Savin' The Day by Alessi,In The Name Of Love by The Thompson Twins,I Can Wait Forever by Air Supply,Hot Night by Laura Branigan Disco Inferno by The Trammps and Cleanin' up the town by The Bus Boys. A fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI,Supernatural Films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see Ghostbusters,an hilarious and unforgettable classic from beginning to end that you will watch again and again and is a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,0,9 November 2012
Back to the Future Part III," An Excellent,Unforgettable Finale To The Trilogy And A Classic.
","Back To The Future Part III is an excellent and unforgettable finale to the Back To The Future Trilogy that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,a fantastic script,an amazing score and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future Part III a memorable conclusion to the Back To The Future Trilogy and a classic.Taking place after the events in Part II,Back To The Future Part III has Marty(Michael J. Fox)traveling back in time to the Old West to Hill Valley in 1885 to rescue Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)and get him back to 1985. While there in the old west Marty and Doc have to deal with outlaw Buford Maddog Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson)while Doc falls in love with a woman named Clara(Mary Steenburgen).Back To The Future Part III is a brilliant and entertaining finale to the amazing Back To The Future Trilogy and basically proves that all good things must come to an end. Making a final film in a movie Trilogy is tough but Director Robert Zemeckis has created a conclusion that brings things to a fitting end that brings the Back To The Future Trilogy full circle. For 118 minutes Back TO The Future Part III combines different movie genres such as SCI-FI,Comedy,Western,Action and romance giving viewers a genre mash-up of 10 different movies in one but the movie never becoming uneven or confused. Whereas the first film went back in time to the 1950s and the second film went to the past present and future in 2015,Back To The Future goes back in time to the Old West with six shooters,Cowboys and stagecoaches. While the concept of a time traveling movie set in the West won't appeal to most viewers speaking for myself as a Western movie fan I loved it. There are plenty of references to Classic Westerns in Back To The Future Part III mostly to Clint Eastwood Westerns(Marty calls himself Clint Eastwood and wears a poncho resembling Eastwood's in the Spagetti Westerns). Don't expect a realistic or gritty vision of the Wild West because the way the West is depicted in this film is all in great fun. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF PIII are funny,over the top and go with the energy and style of the film which is lighthearted and humorous. The screenplay by Bob Gale is fantastic and memorable with dialog that gives this movie a nice energy and pace that keeps the movie going. While all three BTTF films are character driven Part III is probably the most character driven and introspective especially with our Heroes Marty and Doc Brown. With each of the three films we see Marty becoming more mature but still dealing with issues(Marty doesn't like being called a chicken). But as the film goes on he learns to grow and deal with the problem in an interesting way. With Doc Brown we see a different side to him we didn't see in the first two movies where we see Doc Brown firing a Western style gun,falling in love,showing romantic feelings or dancing with a woman which adds to Doc's character. We also see Marty and Doc friendship at a crossroads because while Marty wants to take Doc back to 1985,Doc is debating whether he wants to stay or go and dealing with their futures. It's the examination of Marty and Doc Brown's characters in this one that make Part III so watchable. The ending of Back To The Future Part III(which is the final 20-30 minutes)is fantastic,thrilling and will leave you with a smile and an unforgettable conclusion to the Back To The Future saga and for Marty and Doc. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent and brilliant as Marty McFly(and Shamus McFly)and Doc Brown once again showing great chemistry. Mary Steenburgen is wonderful and beautiful as Clara,Doc's love interest. Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as Griff Tannen,a Western outlaw and once again as Biff. Lea Thompson is great in a duel role as Maggie Mcfly and Lorianne Baines-McFly. Elisabeth Shue does a good job as Jennifer,Marty's girlfriend. Matt Clark(Chester The Bartender),Pat Buttram(Saloon Old Timer),Harry Carey Jr.(Saloon Old Timer),Dub Taylor(Saloon Old-Timer),James Tolkan(Marshal James Strickland),Marc McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Spencer(Linda McFly)and Flea(Needles)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is outstanding,with Zemeckis bringing the same energy and style to the Western setting. Great direction,Zemeckis.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding,thrilling and fits in well with the Western atmosphere. Fantastic score,Silvestri.The Special Effects by Industrial,Light And Magic are incredible and visual stunning once again. Amazing effects,ILM.In final word,if you love Robert Zemeckis,SCI-FI Films,or the first two Back To The Future films I highly suggest you see Back To The Future Part III,an excellent and unforgettable finale to the trilogy. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,3,3,10 December 2015
Evil Dead," An Excellent,Scary And Gory Remake.
","Evil Dead is an excellent,scary and gory remake of the Horror classic The Evil Dead. Filled with great direction,wonderful special effects and a good cast,Evil Dead is one of the best remakes in recent years.Evil Dead tells the story of five friends including siblings Mia(Jane Levy)and David(Shiloh Fernandez)who are staying at a remote cabin in the woods. While there the group unintentionally unleash dead demons who want to posses and kill the group one by one. Now,the group has to figure out how to stay alive and survive...The Evil Dead.Over the past ten years the word 'Remake' has left a bad taste in Horror fans mouths seeing Horror classics being remade left and right and it seemed like no Horror film was excluded from being remade. One of those Horror classics that was remade was Sam Raimi's brilliant The Evil Dead one of my all-time favorite Horror films. I love the original Evil Dead and the Evil Dead trilogy as a whole and when I heard it was being remade I thought no one can replace Bruce Campbell as Ash or Sam Raimi as the director. But when I finally saw the remake I thought while it doesn't replace the original Evil Dead is one of the best remakes I have seen in years. Right from the opening credits ED grabs you by the throat and does not let go until the very end and gives viewers a frightening and scary experience. What is scary and creepy about this new ED is that you never know what to expect and that you are on the edge of your seat the entire time and that you do not know who's going to live or die. We as the audience go through the same dread and torture the characters go through in and it can be very painful and hard to sit through but I think that's what adds to the suspense. What I also like about this film is that while it is a remake of the original film,it decides to go it's own way by giving viewers the same story,but with new characters and a couple of twists and additions to the film. It's a remake of the original while it is it's own film. The only thing I don't like about the film is the lack of Humor the original film and the other ED films had although at times I did laugh at the film. I appreciate the serious this movie had,but I would have liked to see some more humor in the movie. The Demons in this film are scary and creepy but are different from the Demons in the original ED trilogy because in the original trilogy the evil Demons possessed humans and made the possessed humans do horrible things the Demons in the new ED still make humans do horrible things but curse like sailors and say vulgar things almost to the point whether you don't know whether to laugh or be horrified. The Demons in this film have more in common with The Devil in The Exorcist than the Demons in the original ED Trilogy. ED is probably one of the bloodiest,goriest Horror films that I have seen in recent years and it's no surprise that the film originally got an NC-17 by the MPAA(changed to an R-Rating). When the blood and gore starts to come out it keeps coming and never stops and even the most seasoned Horror fan who has probably seen it all will get grossed out by the gore and violence. The film is so bloody and gory you will feel like the blood come off the screen and into your face. The ending of the film is great and the bloodiest 15 minutes you will see in a recent Horror film. Also,look after the end credits and you will see one of the great surprises in movie history.The cast does a great job in their roles. Jane Levy is excellent as Mia,with Levy bringing emotion and lots of depth to the role. Shiloh Fernandez is wonderful as David,Mia's brother with Fernandez having great chemistry with Levy. Lou Taylor Pucci gives a great performance as Eric,the one who knows what's going on. Jessica Lucas(Olivia)and Elizabeth Blackmore(Natalie)give good performances as well.Fede Alverez(in his directorial debut)does an amazing job with the direction of the film,with Alverez bring a great visual style and atmosphere to the film while also doing well with the scary scenes. Although Alverez's direction is not as kinetic or as strong as Raimi's,it's still great direction from Alverez.The score by Roque Banos is effective and memorable and fits with the tone of the film. Great score.The special make-up effects in the film excellent,gory,realistic,messy and bloody and definitely work for the film. Excellent effects.In final word,if you love the original Evil Dead or the whole Evil Dead Trilogy,you will love the new Evil Dead,a scary,gory and effective Horror film that stands alongside the original,one of the best Horror remakes in recent years and is worth the price of admission.

The Evil Dead," One Of The Greatest Horror Films Of All Time. Sam Raimi And Bruce Campbell's Best Film.
","The Evil Dead is one of the greatest Horror films of all time that is not only a Cult Classic,but a Horror Classic as well.Made on a low budget of 350,000$ and filled with Great direction,great special effects,originality and Dark Humor,The Evil Dead is in my opinion the best and my favorite of The Evil Dead trilogy,Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell's best film and is not only one of my favorite Horror films of all time,but one of my favorite films all time.The Evil Dead tells the story of five college students who are on vacation and rent a cabin in the woods. While there the five students unintentionally bring back evil demons from the dead that wants to possess the students one by one. Now,it's all up to Ash(Bruce Campbell)who has to fight off the demons and survive...The Evil Dead.I think one of the reasons The Evil Dead is a Horror classic was because when the film came out in the early 80s slasher films were all the rage at the time,but The Evil Dead was a different animal. Instead of making another slasher film,director Sam Raimi,decided to make a movie about demonic possession and give viewers a scary,horrifying and original experience. One of the reasons ED is such a scary and frightening film is because like some of the best Horror films you never know what to expect and don't know what's coming,with the scary situations in the film are insane,wild,creepy and frightening. The scares in the film are done with great timing,imagination and effect,using creepy sound effects for the demons and strange noises outside in the woods giving viewers an uneasy feeling because with ED there is great build up to the to the Horror and once the Horror starts it never ever stops and for 85 minutes you are put on a terrifying and scary thrill ride that doesn't quit until the very end. The atmosphere in the film is excellent,showing the woods not as a beautiful place you want to be at for a vacation,but a place that's ugly and evil filled with fog and smoke and pulsating with darkness and dread. What also makes the atmosphere in ED scary and excellent is the POV shots of the demons and the unique camera angles smartly not showing the faces of the demons when they're chasing and stalking the main characters but showing the faces of the main characters when they're being chased. The camera angles and shots from Raimi are unique and stylish with tilted angles and over the head shots adding to ED's brilliance and making the film rise above most low budget Horror films. Ash in this film is a character we can relate to because while Ash is the hero of the film Ash goes through a lot of pain and terror that most human beings can stand to bear. Although Ash isn't the tough guy(he's still scared in the other films)he became in the sequels Ash still finds a way to fight the evil demons but still realizes he's in way over his head and that's one of the things that makes Ash an iconic character The violence and gore in the film is not for the weak at heart,it's effective,bloody, gory and disgusting and when the blood and gore comes into the film the blood flows and never stops. ED is one of the most politically incorrect and craziest Horror films ever made and I don't know if it was intentional or not,but the film has a dark sense of Humor about itself because while the film is pure Horror there are some things in the film that are so over the top you can't help but laugh whether it's the demons taunting the main characters or the slapstick suffering the characters go through. The dark Comedy and Humor were pushed even further in the sequels Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn and Army Of Darkness and it's one of the things that makes this series great and unique. The ending of the film is insane,bloody,twisted and full of energy and will be something you'll never forget and is one of the great things that makes ED a Horror classic.The cast does a good job with their roles. Bruce Campbell does a wonderful job as Ash,the hero of the film,bringing sympathy and likability to the role. Ash isn't the tough-talking shotgun using hero he became in the sequels,but Ash still does heroic things in the film. Ellen Sandweiss does a good job as Cheryl,Ash's frightened sister. Hal Delrich does a fine job Scott,Ash's friend. Betsy Baker is good as Linda,Ash's girlfriend. Sarah York does a fine job as Shelly,Scott's girlfriend.The direction from Sam Raimi is just excellent and stylish,using great angles,POV shots,intense close-ups and also does well in the scary scenes. Great direction from Raimi.The score by Joe Doluca is scary,effective,frightening and fits in with the film's creepy tone. A great score.The special effects by Tom Sullivan is amazing,disgusting,frightening and unforgettable and are well done for a low budget.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Cult Films,Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell or cinema in general,you'll love The Evil Dead,a brilliant Horror classic from beginning to end that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,3,13 February 2013
From Dusk Till Dawn," One Of The Greatest Vampire Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Thrilling,Over The Top Action-Horror-Thriller Cult Classic From Robert Rodriguez And Quentin Tarantino.
","From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the greatest vampire films ever made,an excellent and over the top Action-Horror-Thriller that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a great script,a memorable score and soundtrack and outstanding special effects. All of those elements make From Dusk Till Dawn a Cult Classic that is Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino at their best.From Dusk Till Dawn tells the story of criminals and brothers Seth(George Clooney)and Richie Gecko(Quentin Tarantino)who are on the run from the cops and have to get across the border to Mexico with their hostages Jacob Fuller(Harvey Keitel)and his kids Kate(Juliette Lewis)and Scott(Ernest Liu). When the Geckos and the Fullers arrive in Mexico they go into a bar called the Titty Twister which is filled with bloodsucking Vampires. Now,The Geckos and Fullers have to fight the Vampires and stay alive.From Dusk Till Dawn is a brilliant and memorable Action-Horror-Thriller that was a collaboration between film directors and best friends Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino(who wrote the screenplay). Together Rodriguez and Tarantino combined their respective talents and crafted one of the best Vampire films of all-time and is a film that spawned a Television show and two Direct-to-DVD sequels and is a Cult Classic from the moment you watch it. From Dusk Till Dawn is a terrific and truly unforgettable genre film that is like a gigantic fireball that hits you in the face right from the start and has an intensity that never stops until the very end. From Dusk Till Dawn is a film that embraces it's B-movie roots giving the audience a bloody,gory and over the top Vampire movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and basically tells the viewers to have a good time giving viewers a Grindhouse movie that throws in everything but the kitchen sink giving us a Horror movie,Action film,Crime Drama and Western all in one with a dark Comedic style. One of the things that I have always enjoyed about FDTD and one of the reasons it stands out from other Vampire flicks is the way the movie is structured. The first half of the film is more like a Crime Drama focusing on the Geckos and the Fullers and the efforts to try to get to Mexico with mostly dialog getting viewers to know the main characters who are interesting and have depth. It's very much like a Quentin Tarantino film. The second half of the film is just pure Action-Horror and is very much like a Robert Rodriguez film because it is filled with Vampires,blood,guts and carnage all around with tons of excitement and chaos. The dialog and character driven style of Tarantino and the wild over the top Action of Rodriguez go together well with nothing feeling uneven or mismatched. And Speaking of dialog,the screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is wonderful with memorable dialog that is well-written and interesting. And while the dialog in FDTD isn't iconic or fresh like Tarantino's other efforts it's still a great screenplay with terrific lines. The Vampires in FDTD are ugly,vicious and brutal and are not the kind of Vampires you want to be friends with because when they attack a human the Vampires tear a person to shreds. These Vampires in FDTD are not the romantic type but are ugly and disgusting creatures who at the drop of a hat(or in this case a drop of human blood)will kill anyone with a heartbeat and suck the blood out you. The blood and gore in FDTD disgusting and comes out like water and truly feels like a Splatter movie. The Action is explosive,fiery and fast and will have viewers on the edge of their seat because the Action comes you never know what's going to happen or when. The Action scenes in FDTD are Robert Rodriguez at the top of his game. The ending of From Dusk Till Dawn is amazing and filled with tons of Action and gore that is filled with tons of chaos and mayhem that perfectly goes with the rest of the film. A terrific and memorable conclusion.The cast is wonderful. George Clooney is excellent and at his best as Seth Gecko,with Clooney being charismatic and cool. Harvey Kietel is terrific as Jacob Fuller,a preacher. Quentin Tarantino is outrageous and memorable as Richie Gecko,Seth's mentally unstable brother. Juliette Lewis is fantastic as Kate Fuller,Jacob's daughter. Ernest Liu does a good job as Scott,Jacob's son. Salma Hayek is outstanding and sexy as Santacio Pandemonium,an exotic dancer. Cheech Marin is incredible in his trio of roles(Border Guard,Chet Pussy,Carlos). Tom Savini(Sex Machine)and Fred Williamson(Frost)do great jobs as guys that the help the Geckos and Fullers against the Vampires. Danny Trejo(Razor Charlie),Michael Parks(Texas Ranger Earl McGraw),John Hawkes(Pete Bottoms,Liquor Store Clerk),John Saxon(FBI Agent Stanley Chase),Marc Lawrence(Old Timer Motel Owner),Kelly Preston(Newscastor Kelly Houge)and Brenda Hillhouse(Hostage Gloria Hillhouse)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Rodriquez is terrific with Rodriguez always moving the camera and giving the movie a stylish look with zooms,close-up as well as high and low angles while doing a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful job,Rodriguez.The score by Greame Revell is great,intense and fits with the tone of the movie. Fine score,Revell. There is also a great soundtrack with songs by The Blasters(Dark Night),ZZ Top and Tito And Tarantula. Cool soundtrack.The Special Make-Up and Practical Effects by the always great K.N.B EFX Group is amazing as always with make-up effects that add to the film. Terrific job once again,K.N.B.In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Quentin Tarantino,Vampire movies,Horror Films or Action movies,I highly suggest you see From Dusk Till Dawn,one of the greatest Vampire movies ever made and an excellent Action-Horror-Thriller Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,1,15 December 2014
The Dark Knight," One Of The Greatest Superhero/Comic Book Films And Sequels Ever Made. A True Classic From Christopher Nolan.
","The Dark Knight is an absolute classic and is not only one of the best Superhero/Comic Book films ever made but also one of the best Sequels ever made. Filled with Powerful direction,Brilliant Acting performances and excellent Action,The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan at his best and most powerful.Set after the events in Batman Begins,The Dark Knight now tells the story about how now Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)has to not only deal with the Mob,but also has to deal with a psychotic criminal named The Joker(Heath Ledger)who wants the destroy Gotham City and make the innocent corrupt.The Dark Knight is a powerful and unforgettable Classic that came out month after Heath Ledger's tragic death which cast a shadow over the film and with or without Ledger presence The Dark Knight is still an excellent film. With The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan has created an unforgettable cinematic experience,giving viewers a bigger and larger film than Batman Begins because when you look at Batman Begins as great as it is you feel like Nolan was taking a test drive with a car and trying to know the Batman world,but with The Dark Knight Nolan does not a take a test and knows this world from the ground up. With TDK Nolan gives viewers a true epic scope raising the Superhero genre to another level and makes a complex film filled with tragedy and sadness. TDK while definitely a Superhero/Comic Book film has much more in common with a Crime Drama because of gangsters and the Mob always in the film and the Cops and lawyers that are always trying to stop them and The Joker while also dealing with Money and corruption. You feel like you are watching a Superhero film if it were directed by Martin Scorsese or Michael Mann because like the Crime Dramas of those two films TDK deals with many characters and themes such as the crime,corruption and moral ambiguity. In other words TDK has more in common with Epic Crime Dramas like The Godfather,Goodfellas,Casino,The Departed and Heat than say The Fantastic Four films. Nolan creates a world in TDK where there is a since of doom and dread all around where the city of Gotham is being held hostage and just filled with tension and falling apart and waiting to explode in a shred of darkness. Batman and The Joker in this is a true story of Good and Evil with Batman trying to defend and protect the citizens of Gotham City and trying to bring some good into the city and does not kill,but The Joker is different because The Joker is true evil that just wants to see Gotham City burn and corrupt the innocent people of the city including Batman himself. The Joker believes that people in general are not good and can be brought down to his level of darkness. The film is battle but a complex one because Batman asks himself this question:What can I do at all costs to stop The Joker? Can Batman do it the right way or could Batman kill The Joker and be brought down to The Joker's level? TDK is a chess game and also a Cat and Mouse game where Batman is not only trying to save Gotham but trying to beat The Joker. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan is superb with dialog and scenes that are something William Shakespere would write because the film is filled with sadness and darkness all over. Although the film is long at 2 Hours and 32 minutes the movie moves by so fast you would think that you were watching a 90 minute film than a two and half hour film. The Action scenes in the film are masterful and are much more intense than in BB. The Action is filled with great suspense and jaw-dropping visuals and will have you glued to the screen. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and like I said before this film will have you glued to the screen but also on the edge of your seat leaving you wanting more. It is a great,sad and tragic conclusion that will leave asking questions and prepares viewers for The Dark Knight Rises.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent once again as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing depth,toughness and sadness to the role. The late Heath Ledger earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant and terrifying performance as The Joker. Ledger's performance is scary,menacing and masterful making Ledger's Joker one of the greatest villains in movie history. Aaron Eckhart is great as Harvey Dent,an idealistic lawyer. Michael Caine is great once again as Alfred,Bruce's Butler. Maggie Gyllenhaal does a good job as Rachel,Bruce and Harvey's love interest. Gary Oldman is fantastic once again as Officer Jim Gordon. Morgan Freeman is great once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Eric Roberts(Maroni),Anthony Michael Hall(Mike Engel),Richie Coaster(Chechen),Cillian Murphy(Scarecrow)and Nathan Gamble(James Gordan Jr.)give good performances as well.The direction by Christopher Nolan is masterful and brilliant,with Nolan using great camera angles and giving the film a haunting and beautiful visual style and also does great job in the Action scenes. Great direction from Nolan.The score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is excellent,dark and intense and matches the gritty and grim tone of the film. Amazing score by Zimmer and Howard.In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I Highly suggest you see The Dark Knight,one of the best sequels ever made and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,5,9,1 May 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent Gangster Film And An Unforgettable Epic Masterpiece From Sergio Leone.
","Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece.Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal.Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather Trilogy,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness. Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending.The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,3,8,12 June 2013
Grindhouse," An Excellent,Thrilling And Unforgettable Double Bill And Film Experience.
","Grindhouse is an excellent and unforgettable film experience and a entertaining double feature from Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez/ Filled with amazing direction from Tarantino and Rodriguez,great casts and hilarious fake trailers from Rodriguez,Eli Roth,Rob Zombie and Edgar Wright,Grindhouse is a double feature that will stay with you.Grindhouse is a wild double feature of two over the top Horror films.First film:Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. Set in Texas,Planet Terror tells the story of a group of people led by go-go dancer Cherry Darling(Rose Mcgowan)and her ex-boyfriend El Wray(Freddy Rodriguez)who are trying to survive a Zombie outbreak.Second Film:Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. Death Proof tells the story of two groups of women who are being stalked by a psychotic stunt car driver named Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russell),a guy who kills people with his car.Released in 2007,Grindhouse was an amazing double feature that was a failure at the box office grossing only 25 million dollars that was well below it's 53 million dollar budget. That's a shame because I think people missed out on a great and fun time at the movies with two films that gives viewers Action,Hot,beautiful Women,gore and B-movie delight. Planet Terror:Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror is an excellent Zombie movie and was and is my favorite and the best of the two Grindhouse films. Right from the very beginning Planet Terror is a movie that pays homage to Zombie films from the 1970s and 80s giving viewers excitement,thrills and Action and you never take it seriously thanks to the characters and offbeat Humor that the movie has. When the Action starts it never stops and PT has an energy that is wild and over the top and it truly matches the style and tone of a Drive-in B-Movie and Rodriguez rolls with it with scratches on the film's photography and insane editing. Planet Terror's main characters are flawed but are likable and heroic to the point where you want them to survive and live. The Action is PT is amazing and exciting filled with gunfights and explosions that are done in Comic Book style and Robert Rodriguez's other movies. The blood and gore in PT is very disgusting and not for the weak at heart but at times is done for laughs because the blood and gore splashes on the screen like water and paint. The final 20-30 minutes of Planet Terror are brilliant and Action-packed and will have you cheering. A great conclusion. After Planet Terror there is an intermission that includes four fake movie trailers including the trailer at the start of the film Robert Rodriguez's Action-packed and fun Machete(which later became a feature film),a Action-filled and over the top homage to Vigilante and Revenge films of the 1970s and 80s,Rob Zombie's Werewolf Women Of The SS,Edgar Wright's Don't and last but not least Eli Roth's Thanksgiving,a hilarious parody of 1970s and 80s Slasher Films. After the intermission came the second feature Death Proof. Death Proof:Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof is a film I have always had mixed feelings about because it's not a bad film in any sense of the word but a flawed film the ranks below Tarantino's best work but at the same time there are good things about the film. One of the things I like about the film is the style and look of the film which makes the movie feel like a exploitation film of the 1970s with scratches on the film as well as gritty photography and you will feel that Tarantino knows his exploitation movies. Another One of the things I like about Death Proof is it's Tarantino's take on the Slasher Film where instead of a knife welding psychopath with a mask killing the victims it's a crazy former Stuntman car driver named Stuntman Mike who kills with a his car who doesn't wear a mask or carry a knife. When Stuntman Mike is in the film the movie the character makes the film interesting but when he's gone the film feels empty. DP is a Slasher film that is combined with the Car chase films of the 1970s and Tarantino gives viewers one of the best car chases in film history which is exciting and intense and a car crash which is truly disturbing and shocking. What I don't like about the film is the female characters their dialog and talking and the ending. While the female characters are sexy and attractive the talking and dialog by the female characters is boring and dull and add nothing to the film and makes you root for Stuntman Mike than the female characters. It seems like Tarantino got too attached to his dialog. The ending of the film while good makes me mad as a fan of Kurt Russell and it's kind of hard for me to look at the screen and watch what happens to Russell. The ending of Death Proof is fine but could have been handled better.The casts is both films including Rose McGowen(Cherry Darling),Freddy Rodriguez(El Wray),Kurt Russell(Stuntman Mike),Rosario Dawson(Abernathy)and more do excellent jobs in their roles.The directions by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are excellent,with Rodriguez always moving the camera and bringing a wild and insane energy to the film and Tarantino also moving the camera with great angles and slow movements while also bringing a wild energy to the film. Great directions by Rodriguez and Tarantino.The score for Planet Terror by Robert Rodriguez,Graeme Revell and Carl Thiel is brilliant,stylish and similar to the scores by John Carpenter in the 1980s and matches the tone of Planet Terror. Great score. While Death Proof soundtrack is a amazing mixture of songs in the genres of Rock N'Roll,Soul and R&B. Wonderful soundtrack.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Robert Rodriguez,Horror films,B-movies,Drive-in films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see Grindhouse,an excellent double bill and film experience you will never forget. Highly Recommended/ 10/10.",10,1,2,11 September 2013
The Fly," One Of The Greatest Horror Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Terrifying ,Unforgettable Classic From David Cronenberg
","The Fly is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,terrifying and unforgettable classic that combines fantastic direction,terrific performances,amazing special Make-Up Effects and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Fly one of the finest remakes of all-time that is David Cronenberg at his best.The Fly tells the story of an eccentric scientist Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum)who has made transportation pods that can transfer anyone and anything from one place to another. When Brundle decides to try the pods himself a Fly that is also in the pod is mixed with his DNA and stars to make Seth turn into a fly.By 1986 Director David Cronenberg had already mastered and perfected the Body Horror sub genre thanks to great Horror films such as The Dead Zone(1983),Videodrome(1983),Scanners,The Brood(1979),Shivers(1975)and Rabid(1977) but in 1986 Cronenberg would release his swan song to the Body Horror genre and his most famous and iconic of his Body Horror films with The Fly,a brilliant and unforgettable SCI-FI/Horror film that was co-produced by Mel Brooks film company Brooksflims(yes the Mel Brooks)and was a critical and Box Office success for David Cronenberg but is also one of finest remakes of all-time. While a remake of the 1958 classic of the same name David Cronenberg has also re-imagined the story to suit his style in creating one of the most horrifying,disturbing and disgusting films ever made. From start to finish,The Fly is movie that is truly goes with the definition of psychological terror because this is a movie that is intense,gripping and harms you not just mentally but physically as well with a tale that is dark,grim and is like living a nightmare that just becomes more and more frightening and once the Horror starts it never stops. The Fly is one of those films that is not very easy to watch but it's a movie that will stick with you. While The Fly is a SCI-FI/Horror film it's other things too it's a character study,a love story(in it's own way)and a sad tragedy told in Cronenberg's style with claustrophobia and dread. As I said before The Fly is a character study and it's character study of the main character Seth Brundle and his downfall. When we see Seth in the early part of the film we see that he's eccentric and weird,but a decent guy. But when he goes into the transportation pod and comes out with the fly he becomes a different person and we see him in the rest of the film transforming into a monster. One of the scariest things about the movie is that each time we come back to Brundle we see him looking worse and worse as he's becoming this creature(Brundlefly) while his body is falling apart and pretty much losing his mind. Brundle's transformation from human to fly is a tr frightening look at madness,fear and how a science experiment can go completely wrong. One of the things I have to warn people about is the blood and gore. The blood and gore in The Fly is some of the ugliest,gross and gruesome ever shown on screen and is truly not for the weak at heart or for weak stomachs. I mean I have seen many Horror films where I am used to Blood and gore but there is something about the blood and gore in The Fly that is unsettling and make the movie more bleak than it already was will make viewers vomit with agony. The blood and gore adds to the film and gives the movie an extra edge and darkness that hangs over The Fly. The ending of The Fly is amazing and unforgettable with fright,terror and surprises. A terrific conclusion.The cast is great. Jeff Goldblum is excellent and at his best as Seth Brundle,with Goldblum being intense and gripping. Geena Davis is wonderful as Veronica,a journalist and Seth's love interest with Davis having great chemistry with Goldblum. John Getz is fantastic as Stahis,Veronica's ex-boyfriend. Joy Boushel is great and sexy as Tawny,a girl Seth meets. Also,lookout for a cameo by director David Cronenberg as a Gyneocolgist.The direction by David Cronenberg is amazing,with Cronenberg bringing a dark and gloomy atmosphere with great angles and shots. Fantastic direction,Cronenberg.The score by Howard Shore is outstanding,with Shore's score being scary,epic and intense. Great Score,Shore.The Academy Award winning Special and Practical Make-up Effects Chris Walas Inc. is impressive and some of the best and most horrifying Effects ever caught on film. Fantastic Special Make-up Effects.In final word,if you love David Cronenberg,Jeff Goldblum,Horror or SCI-FI,I highly suggest you see The Fly,an excellent,terrifying and unforgettable Hrror classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10",10,1,2,13 April 2016
Reservoir Dogs," An Excellent,Unforgettable Crime Drama And A Cinema Classic. A Masterful Film Debut From Quentin Tarantino.
","Reservoir Dogs is an excellent Crime Drama,A Cinema Classic and one of the best film debuts of all time. Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,amazing screenplay and a fantastic soundtrack,Reservoir Dogs is a great introduction from Quentin Tarantino and is filmmaking and Tarantino at their best.Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of criminals who are brought together to rob a jewelry store and steal diamonds. But when the robbery goes wrong,the criminals think the jewelry heist was a set up and one of them could be an undercover cop and this leads to violence and distrust between thieves.Reservoir Dogs is an excellent,remarkable classic film and the fantastic debut that introduced audiences to one of the biggest and most famous directors in the history of cinema Quentin Tarantino. With Reservoir Dogs Tarantino has crafted one of the finest movie debuts of all time and one of the films that defined independent cinema in the 1990s and was a set up for his masterpiece Pulp Fiction or in other words if Pulp Fiction was dinner then Reservoir Dogs was the appetizer. Reservoir Dogs is an amazing film because what Tarantino has done is taken the influence of American heist film,Asian cinema of the 1980s and French Crime films of the 1960s and used them as an influence and applied it to this film and crafted a movie that right from the start is cool and powerful,stylish and fresh,violent and darkly funny and in many reinventing and recreating the Crime Drama genre and giving it a different style and feel. One of the great things about RD is that we as the viewer never see the jewelry heist actually happen but the events that happen before and after the robbery going back and forth with events and characters. Tarantino didn't want to make a film that went from A to B but a film that was told in unconventional style. The main characters in the film are great because while they are not likable the criminals have certain coolness and charm about them to make you like them and be interested in who they are. Another great thing about the characters is how they act before and after the robbery. Before the robbery the criminals are laughing and joking with each other having good times and talking about various things whether it's tipping waitresses,Madonna's Like A Virgin or planning the robbery but after the robbery there is fear.paranoia and distrust among the group and you don't know what's going to happen between them throughout the film. The screenplay by Tarantino is fantastic and just well-written with Tarantino giving each of the main characters great and memorable dialog that is dramatic,cool and darkly funny with iconic style. The dialog and style of Tarantino screenplay would set us up to what was about to come in Pulp Fiction and later Tarantino films. The violence and Action in the film is bloody and shocking and when the violence happens it is surprising and unexpected and when you watch RD you as the viewer feel like no one is safe from violence that's in the air. Although RD is not an Action film The film has great Action scenes and the Action in the film comes at an intense and rapid fire pace and when you see the Action in the film you will feel the impact of the Action scenes. The ending for RD is great and unforgettable and you will be blown away by it's power and intensity. The ending will stay in your mind and is one of the reasons Reservoir Dogs is a classic.The whole cast is wonderful. Harvey Keitel is excellent and intense as Mr. White-Larry with Keitel bringing depth and power to the role. Tim Roth is brilliant as Mr. Orange-Freddy and has great scenes with Keitel. Michael Madsen is wonderful and frightening as Mr. Blonde-Vic Vega,a psychotic criminal. Chris Penn is fantastic as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot,Joe's son. Steve Busemi is a great scene stealing delight as Mr. Pink,a fast talking criminal. Lawrence Tierney is wonderful and intense as Joe Cabot,the boss of the group of thieves. Eddie Bunker(Mr. Blue),Quentin Tarantino(Mr. Brown),Randy Brooks(Holdaway)and Kirk Baltz(Officer Nash)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for voice-over work by Comedian Steven Wright(K-Billy Radio DJ).The direction by Quentin Tarantino is brilliant with Tarantino always moving the camera with hand held photography and powerful intensity and slow movements and close ups. Great direction,Tarantino.The soundtrack is fantastic with songs from Harry Nilson(Coconut),George Baker Selection(Little Green Bag),Stealers Wheel(Stuck In The Middle With You),Joe Tex(I Gotcha),Sandy Rogers(Fool For Love),Bedlam(Magic Carpet Ride),Blue Swede(Hooked On A Feeling)and more. An amazing soundtrack.The special make-up effects by K.N.B FX are excellent,bloody and very realistic and add to the film. Great make-up effects from K.N.B.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Reservoir Dogs,an excellent and unforgettable classic from Quentin Tarantino that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,0,11 July 2013
Total Recall," An Excellent,Thrilling SCI-FI/Action Classic. Arnold Schwarznegger And Paul Verhoeven At Their Best.
","Total Recall is an excellent,thrilling SCI-FI/Action classic that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,intense Action,great special make-up and visual effects and a memorable score. All of those elements make Total Recall an unforgettable film that is Arnold Schwarnegger and Paul Verhoeven at their best.Based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick and set on Earth and Mars,Total Recall tells the story of Douglas Quaid(Arnold Scwarzenegger),a construction worker who goes to a place called Rekall that sells made up vacations in a machine. When things go wrong at Rekall,Quaid is sent on a Adventure that takes him from Earth to Mars.Total Recall is a brilliant and thrilling SCI-FI/Action film that teamed up Action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and Director Paul Verhoeven together and with the star power of Schwarzenegger and amazing over the the top Comic Book style of Verhoeven not only created a Box Office hit,but also created one of the most entertaining,memorable and unforgettable SCI-FI/Action movies ever made that re-watchable to this very day. For 113 minutes,Total Recall is an absolute blast and an Action packed thrill and roller coaster ride from start to finish,a movie that when the Action and Adventure starts it never ends and you as a viewer are going to have a ball. Total Recall is also futuristic film told in a big and large scale that is fast paced and never slows down going from Earth to Mars on a journey that is violent and bizarre,intense and mind blowing as well as awe-inspiring and at times darkly Humorous. We also have good guys,bad guys,deformed mutants and discussions of Alien civilization on Mars and everything in between. The movie is done in a style and way that only Vehoeven can do it. You can almost say that the style in Total Recall is pretty much an extension of Paul Verhoeven's early SCI-FI/Action classic Robocop(1987)which can make a great double bill with this film as both movies are dark and satirical visions of the future. I also love how the movie deals with themes such as identity,technology and dreams and also how the movie is questioning whether all of the events in Total Recall are really happening or are they in Quaid's mind. So while Total Recall is a Schwarzenegger film with a lot of Action it is much closer to other Phillip K. Dick adaptations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Steven Spielberg's Minority Report than one might think. The Action scenes in Total Recall are amazing,fast and done with an energy that keeps going whether it's gunfights,fist fights,explosions foot or car chases every Action scene grabs you by the throat. The Action and violence is classic Verhoeven with plenty of blood and gore that comes off of the screen and you will be thrilled or horrified at what you see. The main character Douglas Quaid is very a character in the Schwarzenegger mold: a Hero that is a man of Action,puns and one-liners. But in Total Recall Quaid is a character with some depth because when things start to go wrong he's questioning who he really is and wants to find out about his past and his possible future. While the Douglas Quaid character is similar to other Schwarzenegger characters it's a little different with this film. The ending of Total Recall is fantastic and dazzling with great visuals and has you asking questions wanting more. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent and at his best as Douglas Quaid,with Schwarzenegger bringing depth and charisma to the role. Rachel Ticotin is wonderful as Melina,a woman that helps Quaid. Sharon Stone is terrific as Lori,Doug's wife. Ronny Cox is delightful as Cohaagan,the ruler of Mars. Michael Ironside is fantastic as Ricther,a henchmen for Cohaagan. Marshall Bell(George/Kuato),Mel Johnson Jr.(Benny),Michael Champion(Helm),Dean Norris(Tony),Roy Brocksmith(Dr. Edgemar),Ray Baker(Bob McClane),Rosemary Dunsmore(Dr. Lull),David Knell(Ernie),Alexa Robinson(Tiffany),Robert Costanzo(Harry),Debbie Lee Carrington(Thumbelina),Lycia Naff(Mary),Marc Alamo(Everett)and Pricilla Allan(Fat Lady)give good performances as well.The direction by Paul Verhoeven is terrific,with Verhoeven moving the camera and keeping the film flowing with energy. Outstanding direction,Verhoeven. THThe score by Jerry Goldsmith is sensational,epic and powerful,with Goldsmith's score going with the Action perfectly. Amazing score,Goldsmith.The Special and Practical Make-up Effects by Rob Bottin are stunning,well-done and is among his best work. Terrific make-up effects,Bottin. The Visual Effects are also incredible and truly adds to the film.In final word,if you love Arnold Schwarzenegger,Paul Verhoeven,Action or SCI-FI,I highly suggest you see Total Recall,an excellent and thrilling SCI-FI/Action classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,3,30 March 2016
Pulp Fiction," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Unforgettable Masterpiece Of Cinema From Quentin Tarantino.
","Puip Fiction is easily one of the greatest films ever made and a flawless unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and filmmaking. Filled with excellent direction,great performances from the cast,a perfect well-written screenplay and an amazing soundtrack,Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite films and is Quentin Tarantino's greatest film and a masterpiece.Set in Los Angeles,California,Pulp Fiction tells three interconnected tales set in the crime world that involve two Hit-men Vincent Vega(John Travolta)and Jules Winnfield(Samuel L. Jackson),Mia Wallace,(Uma Thurman),a Gangster's wife and aging boxer Butch Coolidge(Bruce Willis)and all four have to deal with violence,death and redemption.Pulp Fiction is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made a flawless and unforgettable film that is an instant masterpiece and classic from the very moment that you watch. Pulp Fiction is great film because while the film is in the genre of Crime Drama,it's a little more than that because it's a film that mixes categories. It's an epic and violent Crime Drama,a stylized Gangster Film,a Film-Noir,a surreal Black Comedy,a tale of revenge,redemption and fate,an homage and tribute to movies that came before it. Quentin Tarantino takes elements of those genre that I mentioned above and turns them on their heads giving viewers a film that is original,imaginative and unconventional and doesn't play by the rules and that is one of the things I love about the film. Pulp Fiction changed the way I looked at films because before I saw PF movies had plots and stories that moved from A to B but PF was the first film I saw that was told in a unconventional structure that tells the story in a back and forth fashion like chapters in book or a novel. What I love about each of the three stories(Vincent Vega And Marcellus Wallace's Wife,The Gold Watch and The Bonnie Situation)in the film is how wild and unpredictable they all are and how in some ways oddly enough each story is a morality tale with a dark and funny twist. Each story has a wild spin on violence,drugs and sex and the things that happen in all of the stories will disturb but at the same time you are riveted and glued to the screen. The four main characters in the movie Pulp Fiction,Vincent,Jules,Mia and Butch are among the best characters Tarantino has ever conceived because each character is cool and with brilliance. Vincent and Jules are classic characters because despite being hit men are stylish characters with unique personalities who have hilarious conversations about Fast Food Joints,Hamburgers,foot massages and TV pilots and the dialog between the two is funny and memorable. Mia Wallace is one of the few female characters in the film but when she's on screen you never forget her because she is beautiful and charming and when watch Mia and her date with Vincent you can tell that she is flirting with Vincent and playing mind games because we don't know if Mia likes Vincent or if Vincent likes Mia and that's one of the mysteries of the film. Butch Coolidge is a great character because he's an antihero that is rooted in the spirit of Film Noir as a character who is caught in big circumstances that are beyond his control and he has to do what he has to do to survive and fight back. All four characters are amazing,powerful and iconic and help define the movie and after you see Pulp Fiction you will never forget any of them as long as you live. The screenplay by Tarantino(which won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay)is brilliant and perfect with Tarantino each of the main characters great dialog that is fresh and original with a lot of funny black humor that is smart and creative. The violence in the film is brutal and shocking but at the same time funny and morbid and matches surreal over the top tone of the film. The ending of the film is powerful and captivating because while it is intense it's also calm and collective and makes you think. A wonderful ending.The whole cast is perfect. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are excellent and brilliant as Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield,two cool hit-men. Tavolta and Jackson are great together. Uma Thurman is wonderful as Mia Wallace,Marcellus' wife and has great chemistry with Travolta. Bruce Willis is fantastic as Butch,a tough boxer with an honor code and moral ambiguity. Harvey Keitel is great and cool as Winston Wolf,a man who solves problems. Ving Rhames is great and intimidating as Marcellus Wallace,a local crime boss. Tim Roth(Pumpkin)and Amanda Plummer(Honey Bunny)are wonderful and funny as boyfriend/girlfriend robbers. Eric Stolz and Rosanna Arquette are fabulous as Lance,Vincent's friend and drug dealer and Jody,Lance's wife. Christopher Walken is great in his small role as Captain Koons,a soldier that visits Butch. Maria De Medeiros does a fine job as Fabianne,Butch's girlfriend.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is excellent and wonderful with Tarantino always moving the camera with long tracking shots either straight forward or with hand held photography and using close ups and slow camera movements giving the film a great style. Amazing direction by Tarantino.The soundtrack is masterful and one of the best soundtracks in film history with songs by Dick Dale And The Del Tones(Misirlou),Kool & The Gang(Jungle Boogie),Al Green(Let's Stay Together),Chuck Berry(You Never Can Tell),Dusty Springfield(Son Of A Preacher Man),Neil Diamond,(Girl,You'll Be A Woman Soon),The Centurians(Bullwinkle Part II),Link Wray(Ace Of Spades,Rumble),The Lively Ones(Surf Rider),The Slater Brothers(Flowers On The Well),The Revels(Comanche)and more. Fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Pulp Fiction,an excellent and brilliant unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and deserves to be in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,2,12 July 2013
The Untouchables," A Brilliant,Unnforgettable Classic That Mixes Crime Drama,Gangter Film And Action And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. Brian De Palma At His Best.
","The Untouchables is a brilliant,stylish and unforgettable classic and one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with excellent direction,a great cast,a powerful film score,an amazing script and fantastic cinematography,The Untouchables is Brian De Palma,Crime Drama and Cinema at it's best.Based on the television series and book of the same name and set in Chicago,Illnois in the 1930s during prohibition,The Untouchables tells the story of Elliot Ness(Kevin Costner),a Federal agent in the Treasury Department who has been brought to Chicago to stop the flow of illegal liquor and to stop gangster crime boss Al Capone(Robert De Niro). After finding little success,Elliot enlists the help of veteran Chicago Cop Jim Malone(Sean Connery)to help form a team of cops called The Untouchables to get Capone. Now,with the help of two other cops Oscar Wallace(Charles Martin Smith)and George Stone(Andy Garcia),Elliot and Jim prepare to take down Capone at all costs and do it the Chicago way.The Untouchables is one of those excellent films that is an instant classic from beginning to end and is a film that you will never forget and it's also a film where everything the direction,the writing,cast and score just seems to work in a flawless way. The Untouchables is an epic Crime Drama that pulls into the world of the violent prohibition era of the 1930s in Chicago where violence is the name of the game and the only law in Chicago is a gun and money and gangsters rule the world. The Untouchables is great film because of the way it rewrites history and takes real life characters(Elliot Ness,Al Capone)and puts them in a fictional tale that feels very real but in a cinematic way and everything in the film is bigger than life. I know that some critics and viewers have complained about this film not being very realistic or true to real life events or facts but The Untouchables is a movie of entertainment not a documentary. The Untouchables is a great Gangster film and one of the few Gangster films where the events is mostly told from the cops point of view and not the Gangsters and instead of rooting for the gangsters you are rooting for the cops in a battle of good and evil and you want The Untouchables to win. The Cinematography by Stephen H. Burum is beautiful and visually stunning,with Burum bringing a stylish feel to the film where the atmosphere is dark with harsh lighting at night with blue colors and beautiful orange and yellow lighting during the day while bringing an accurate feel of Chicago in the 1930s. Flawlessly,The Untouchables balances out the light and dark not just with the characters but with the cinematography. The main characters Elliot Ness and Jim Malone are great because it's almost like a Father and son relationship where Jim is trying to teach Elliot the ways of how Chicago works and how you get Al Capone. Where as Elliot wants to do everything within the law,Jim tells Elliot to do it the Chicago way with a gun and aggressiveness and take Al Capone down that way. The relationship between Elliot and Jim is truly classic and will stay with you. Al Capone in The Untouchables is portrayed as being larger than life a gangster who rules the city of Chicago with a gun and iron hand but is loved by the media because of his charisma and quotes but underneath that charisma is a guy that is evil and brutal and will kill you when he gets the chance. Capone in this film is evil personified. The screenplay by David Mamet is excellent and memorable,with Mamet giving the main characters tough and gritty dialog that reflects Chicago but is also done in Mamet's masterful style and most of the great scenes with Mamet's dialog is classic and doesn't miss a beat. The Action and gunfight scenes in the film are great and electrifying because each Action scene is done with fantastic build-up and suspense and when the Action happens you are on the edge of your seat especially the Train station scene which in my opinion is one of the best Action scenes in movie history. The ending of The Untouchables is wonderful and will have you cheering at the screen and is one of the many reasons The Untouchables is an amazing classic.The whole cast is amazing. Kevin Costner is brilliant as Elliot Ness,with Costner bringing optimism,toughness and depth to the role. Sean Connery earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his excellent performance as Jim Malone. Connery brings grit,humor and greatness to the role and has great chemistry and scenes with Costner. Charles Martin Smith is wonderful as Agent Oscar Wallace,an accountant. Andy Garcia is fantastic as George Stone,a cop that is a great sharpshooter. Robert De Niro is amazing and at his best as Al Capone,with De Niro bringing charisma and pure evil to the role. Billy Drago is great and unforgettable as Frank Nitti,a Capone guard and assassin Richard Bradford(Police Chief Mike Dorsett),Jack Kehoe(Walter Payne),Brad Sullivan(George),Patricia Clarkson(Catherine Ness),Vito D'Ambrosio(Bow-tie Driver)and Steven Goldstein(Scoop)give good performances as well.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera using great camera angles as well as zooms and close-ups and giving the film a masterful visual style. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,epic,powerful and one of the greatest scores in movie history. Morricone's score is big,stylish and unforgettable and fits in with the tone of the movie and matches every scene in the film and raises the film to a higher level. Another masterful score from Morricone.In final word,if you love Brian De Palma,Crime Dramas,Gangster Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Untouchables,a brilliant and unforgettable classic that will stand the test of time and is a film that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,1,8 July 2013
The Godfather: Part III," A Wonderful,Underrated And Overlooked Finale To The Godfather Trilogy.
","The Godfather Part III is a wonderful,underrated and overlooked finale to The Godfather Trilogy that is filled with great direction,terrific acting and a fine score. While it's not as good as the first two films,The Godfather Part III is a nice conclusion to The Godfather Saga.Set twenty years after the events in Part II,The Godfather Part III depicts Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)who is now older and has finally made the Corleone Family legitimate and on the straight and narrow. But,unfortunately for Michael his past and thoughts of guilt have come back to haunt him and his enemies have lured but into the criminal world while worrying about his family including his nephew Vincent Mancini(Andy Garcia)and daughter Mary(Sofia Coppola).Released in 1990,The Godfather Part III is a sequel that despite being nominated for 7 Academy Awards and being a modest Box Office success sharply divided Godfather fans and movie critics. Some fans and movie critics felt the movie should not have been made and is a bad film compared to the first two films and disliked the casting of Sofia Coppola. Despite the film's flaws it's a really good film in my opinion and is a powerful conclusion to this great trilogy. I don't think Director Francis Coppola was trying to top the first two I think he just wanted to make a satisfying conclusion and he does so here. Francis Coppola has said that the first two films is the series and part III is the epilogue and that is very true with this film because what makes The Godfather Part III so effective is that we have seen what happen to some of the characters in the first two films and we see some of their fates which adds to the tragedy and sadness of this film because we see most of the characters haunted by their past demons and there is a sense of doom that hangs over the film and you will feel like there will be no happy outcome and Francis Coppola shows this to viewers in stylish way. The themes of violence,betrayal and death were in the first two films and it's also in Part III as well and with the Corleone family trying to distance themselves from the Gangster world but what GF III tells us is that while a person can get out of the Gangster world it never leaves any person no matter what they do. When we see the character Michael Corleone in Part III we see a man who has aged and that being the don and leader of the Corleone family has not only taken a mental toll on Michael but a physical toll as well. Where it was kind of tough to have sympathy for Michael in Part II,in this film we finally start to feel terrible for Michael because he is disturbed by his evil deeds and what he has done and realize he never wanted to be a the head of The Corleone family or be a gangster he felt like he had no choice. Throughout GF III we see Michael trying to reclaim his tortured soul that was pretty damaged after the events in Part II and it's not a sinner trying to become a saint but a man trying to bring some goodness into his life. The Godfather films are in their own way morality tales about people and the things that they do and the unfortunate consequences of people's Actions. The Godfather films are known for their violent scenes and Part III doesn't hold anything back giving viewers a few scenes that are shocking and horrific. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is good and memorable even though the script lacks the greatness of the first two films. The ending of The Godfather Part III is amazing and is one of the saddest and most heartbreaking endings in film history and no matter how many times I see the ending it still gets to me. A powerful and fitting end to The Godfather Trilogy.The cast is wonderful. Al Pacino is excellent as Michael Corleone,with Pacino bringing emotion,power and depth to role. Diane Keaton is wonderful as Kay Adams,Michael's former wife. Talia Shire is terrific as Connie Corleone,Michael's sister. Andy Garcia is outstanding as Vincent Mancini,Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son and Michael's nephew. Eli Wallach is amazing as Don Atobello,an old-time Gangster. Joe Mantegna is great and clever as Joey Zasa,a smooth talking Gangster. Sophia Coppola does an O.K job as Mary Corleone and is not as bad as everyone says. Richard bright is sensational as Al Neri,Michael's old bodyguard. Bridget Fonda(Grace Hamilton),George Hamilton(B.J Harrison)Donal Donnelly(Archbishop Gilday)and Franc D'Ambrosio(Anthony Vito Corleone) give good performances as well.The direction Francis Coppola is fantastic and stylish,with Coppola a beautiful and amazing visual style to the film. Great direction,Coppola.The score by Carmine Coppola is wonderful,epic and matches the tone of the film. Outstanding score,Carmine.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,the first two Godfather films,Gangster Films or Crime Dramas,I highly suggest you see The Godfather Part III,a wonderful,underrated sequel that deserves a second chance. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",10,2,4,1 April 2014
The Departed," An Excellent,Unforgettable Epic Gangster Film/Crime Drama/Thriller Remake. Another Martin Scorsese Classic.
","The Departed is an excellent and unforgettable Epic Gangster Film and Crime Drama/Thriller remake that combines amazing direction,great performances from the cast,a terrific script and a memorable score and soundtrack. All of those elements make The Departed not only a great Gangster film and remake but another Martin Scorsese Classic.Set in the Soutn Boston neighborhood of Boston,Massachusetts,The Departed tells the story of police officer Billy Costigan(Leonardo Dicapro)who's been asked by his superiors to undercover and work for a vicious local Gangster and crime boss Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson)and his organization. While undercover,Billy is unaware that there is another cop working for Costello,Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon),a State police detective who is selling information to Costello from the police department. With Billy and Colin both working for Frank will one of them discover each other identities or will one of them become a member of The Departed?The Departed is a brilliant and thrilling Crime Drama Thriller that saw Martin Scorsese return to the genre Scorsese is best known for the Gangster film after two great period dramas Gangs Of New York(2002)and The Aviator(2004). The Departed won Oscars for Best Picture and most importantly Best Director for Martin Scorsese although many agree that Scorsese should've won for his earlier masterworks such as Raging Bull,GoodFellas and Taxi Driver but that doesn't stop The Departed from being the great film that it is. Right from the opening The Departed is an amazing film and an instant Scorsese classic that has you mesmerized and glued to the screen giving viewers a film that intense and powerful and will have viewers on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next and there is constant intrigue going on throughout the but done in a no holds barred style that Scorsese does so well. The Departed is a Gangster film that is rooted in the spirit of Film Noir where the attitudes of the main characters is tough and cynical and the tone and atmosphere is dark and where streets in this film is brutal and cops and criminals only follow the law of the gun. Where as Scorsese's other Gangster film took place in Scorsese's hometown New York City (GoodFellas,Mean Streets)or in Las Vegas(Casino),The Departed takes place on the mean streets of South Boston where the crime world in South Boston isn't as flashy as New York(in terms of clothes and how they live)or other big cities in terms of style but still has the same violent viciousness as it's other big city counterparts and where the Irish Mob and Frank Costello's crew is working class,gritty and people you don't want to mess with. The Crime world in South Boston has a style on it's own. The Departed not only succeeds as a great Gangster film but a great remake of the incredible Asian Crime Drama Infernal Affairs(2002)and while The Departed adapts the plot Infernal Affairs Scorsese's film works as it's own film. The two main characters Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan are great characters because with Costigan being undercover and Sullivan being an informant you see these two dealing with guilt,fear and a sense of dread of someone discovering who the two really are and working for Frank Costello adding to the suspense of the film because while you may not always like the them as people or the things that they do but you will be in their shoes. The violence in The Departed is classic Scorsese because the violence is vicious and brutal and when the film gets bloody the red plasma comes off the screen in dark fashion. If you've seen Scorsese's Goodfellas and Casino you know kind of violence is going to be in this film. The screenplay by William Monahan is terrific,with Monahan giving the film gritty and memorable dialog that feels realistic and reflects the style and tone of South Boston and has characters that are unforgettable. The ending of The Departed is fantastic and memorable because it's shocking and darkly humorous. A great ending to this wonderful film.The whole cast is amazing Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Billy Costigan,with DiCaprio bringing intensity,depth and energy to the role. Matt Damon is brilliant as Colin Sullivan,bringing power and believability to the role. Jack Nicholson is amazing and at his maniacal best as Frank Costello,with Nicholson being intimidating and funny at the same time. Mark Wahlberg is terrific as Sgt. Dignam,with Wahlberg saying great one liners and stealing scenes. Martin Sheen is great as Capt. Queenan,Costgan's boss. Ray Winstone is fantastic as Mr. French,Francis' right hand man. Vera Farminga is wonderful as Madolyn,Colin's girlfriend and Billy's psychiatrist. Alec Baldwin is outstanding and funny as Capt. Ellerby,a hyperactive cop. Anthony Anderson(Trooper Brown),Kevin Corrigan(Cousin Sean),James Badge Dale(Trooper Barrigan),David Patrick O'Hara(Fitzy),Mark Rolston(Delhunt),Robert Wahlberg(Lazio-FBI)and Kristen Dalton(Gwen)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is excellent and stylish,with Scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style with terrific shots and camera angles. Great direction,Scorsese. The score by Howard Shore is fantastic and intense matching the mood and tone of the film. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Let It Loose),Roger Waters,Van Morrison,The Band(Comfortably Numb),The Dropkick Murphys(I'm Shipping Off To Boston),Patsy Cline(Sweet Dreams(Of You),Roy Buchanan(Sweet Dreams),John Lennon(Well,Well,Well),Nas(Thief's Theme),The Beach Boys(Sail On,Sailor)The Allman Brothers Band(One Way Out),Badfinger(Baby Blue),The Human Beinz(Nobody But Me),Lavern Baker(Tweedle Dee)and Joe Cuba(Bang Bang).

Die Hard," The Greatest Action Film Ever Made. An Excellent,Unforgettable Classic.
","Die Hard is the greatest Action film ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,amazing Action and a fantastic score. All of those elements make Die Hard an outstanding movie that is John McTierman and Bruce Willis at their best.Based on the novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp and set in Los Angeles,California,Die Hard tells the story of John McClane(Bruce Willis),a New York City police officer who is visiting his estranged wife Holly Gennero(Bonnie Bedelia)at the Nakotomi Building where she works on Christmas Eve where there is a party going on. While John is at the Nakotomi building a group of terrorist led by Hans Gruber(Alan Rickman)take the building and the workers hostage and it's up to John to stop Hans and his group at all costs.Released in 1988,Die Hard is a brilliant and thrilling movie that was not only a critical and Box Office success but is also made Bruce Willis a movie star and became one of the most influential films of the Action genre that spawned four sequels and changed the genre forever paving the way for other Action movies such as Speed(Die Hard on a Bus),Under Siege(Die Hard on a boat)and Passenger 57(Die Hard on a plane)while at the same time giving viewers a new kind of Action hero. Sure,there were plenty of other influential and amazing Action movie classics that were released before Die Hard Action movies such as Lethal Weapon,Predator,The Terminator,First Blood,Rambo:First Blood Part II,Commando,48 Hrs,The Warriors,Dirty Harry,The French Connection,Escape From New York,The Road Warrior and many more but when Die Hard came out it brought something new to the Action genre and was seen as a breath of fresh air that set the standard for Action movies that followed. From beginning to end Die Hard is a masterful Action film that is Action-packed and exciting as well as very intense and explosive with an energy and pace that is non-stop because Die Hard grabs the viewer by the throat and never lets go. With Die Hard is a movie that is a full-on spectacle where everything whether it's the gunfight or explosions is big and nothing is small with Action on every corner and suspense that is like a tightrope and is gripping. What also makes Die Hard such an incredible movie is the dialog and Humor which is clever,smart and funny with scenes that are memorable and lines that are quotable with perhaps the most iconic line that is said by John McClane which is unforgettable. And while Die Hard isn't an Action-Comedy in the truest sense the film balances Action and laughs perfectly. Die Hard is probably the best Action set right around the Christmas holiday(with Lethal Weapon being the runner up). I don't what it is about Action movies that are set during Christmas or the holidays but the mixture of intense Action and beautiful Christmas decorations is just so much fun. The Action scenes in Die Hard are dazzling,powerful and done in such a flawless way that is jaw dropping and will knock your socks off every time you watch it because each Action is like a fire ball that hits in the face. Die Hard gave birth to one of the greatest,iconic and truly unforgettable characters in the history of cinema in John McClane who is not a classic character but was a new kind of Action hero. Before Die Hard Action movie characters were muscular and had strong arms but John McClane was different and unique because he was a regular guy and average Joe who didn't come to LA to save the day or be a hero but to see his wife for Christmas. When we watch Die Hard we as the viewer relate to McClane and are with him every step of the way whether he's dealing with terrorists or trying to repair his relationship with his wife. Despite his problems John McClane is still tough and handles his problems with both his wits,guns and fists. John McClane is terrific character that set the standard for Action heroes that came after and is someone you will never forget and is one of the reasons Die Hard is a classic. The ending of Die Hard is outstanding and is filled with enough excitement and thrills that will put smiles on viewers faces. A terrific ending.The cast is great.

Psycho," An Excellent,Scary And Landmark Horror Masterpiece And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. Alfred Hitchcock At His Best.
","Psycho is an excellent,scary and landmark Horror Masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made that is filled with amazing direction,a terrific cast,a fantastic script and a masterful score. All of those combinations make Psycho not only a masterpiece of Horror cinema,but also a masterpiece of cinema in general and is Alfred Hitchcock at his very best.Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch,Psycho tells the story of Marion Crave(Janet Leigh),a real estate office secretary that has been given 40,000$ in cash to take to the bank but when Marion doesn't do so,Marion takes the money and goes on the run. Scared and tired,Marion decides to stop at a Motel ran by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins),a young man that runs the Motel and takes care of his Mother. The stay at the Motel leads to horrific and strange turn of events.What can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho that hasn't been said before? The film is a flawless Masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest,scariest and most iconic movies of all time and is the first modern Horror movie that changed the Horror genre as we know it. Prior to Psycho,Horror movies from the 1930s to the 1950s had been done by Universal Films and Hammer Pictures and Horror films mostly dealt with monsters like Zombies,Vampires,Werewolves and creatures from outer space or were set in the 18th or 19th century in castles. But then in 1960 Psycho came out and changed Horror films forever and brought Horror into the modern world and gave viewers a different kind of monster which was a human being and Psycho would set the standard for Horror and Suspense Thrillers that came after Psycho and despite Hitchcock giving cinema many classics and Masterpieces Psycho is Hitchcock's most famous and iconic film. Psycho is a great film that right from the very beginning the movie pulls you into a frightening and terrifying nightmare that is relentless and powerful like a tightrope with white hot suspense that never stops until the very end. Psycho is also a great film because it gave audiences a new and different kind of Horror film that breaks all of the rules and conventions that are associated with Horror and Hollywood films with Hitchcock make people think the film is going to go one way when it goes another and the film gives you a sense of dread and offers no salvation or happiness. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Psycho are done with great timing and much detail and when the scary scenes happen they hit you like an unexpected punch in the face and your heart will be racing because with each scary and suspenseful scene Hitchcock is frightening you not only physically but mentally as well. The style and brilliance of Psycho would influence Horror films and Thrillers that came out years after Psycho's release. Probably the scariest and most suspenseful scene in the film is the famous shower scene,a classic and iconic scene that Hitchcock filmed with such a masterful stroke using clever camera angles and tricks making you watch in awe and terror. It's a scene you will never forget and will change the way you take showers forever. While the film is scary,Psycho wouldn't be as nearly scary without the atmosphere. During the 1950s,Alfred Hitchcock had filmed his movies in color but with Psycho Hitchcock filmed this movie in Black & White thanks to Jack L. Russell's beautiful and visually stunning photography which gives the movie a dark and beautiful Film Noir look that is harsh and bleak almost like you're in a living nightmare. The main characters in Psycho are wonderful because they are not Horror movie stereotypes or Cartoons but real people that viewers will relate to because of the horrific and dangerous situations that happen in the film. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano is amazing and memorable,with Stefano giving the main characters dialog that is tight and incredible. The ending of Psycho is amazing,scary and is an ending you won't expect or see coming. The ending of Psycho is twisted and shocking and is one of the things that makes Psycho a masterpiece.The whole cast is great. Anthony Perkins is excellent and iconic as Norman Bates,with Perkins bringing intensity and power to the role. Janet Leigh is brilliant in her most famous and iconic role as Marion Crane,with Leigh bringing depth and class to the role. Vera Miles is terrific as Lila Crane,Marion's sister. John Galvin is wonderful as Sam Loomis,Marion's boyfriend. Martin Balsam is fantastic as Milton Arbogast,a private detective. John McIntire(Sheriff Al Chambers),Simon Oakland(Dr. Fred Richman),Lurene Tuttle(Mrs. Chambers),Frank Albertson(Tom Cassidy),Patrica Hitchcock(Caroline),Vaughn Taylor(George Lower),John Anderson(California Charlie)and Mort Mills(Highway Patrol Officer)give good performances as well.The direction by Alfred Hitchcock is excellent and stylish,with Hitchcock constantly moving the camera and using amazing angles giving the film a great visual style and tone while doing a terrific job with the scary and suspenseful scenes. Masterful direction by Hitchcock.The score by Bernard Herrmann is brilliant,scary,intense and one of the greatest and most iconic scores in movie history and it truly matches the film's dark and frightening tone. Terrific score by Herrmann.In final word,if you love Alfred Hitchcock,Horror films or movies in general,I highly suggest you see Psycho,an excellent,scary landmark Horror Masterpiece,one of the greatest films ever made that you can watch again and again and is Alfred Hitchcock at his best.",10,0,1,21 October 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," An Excellent And Hilarious Black Comedy-Drama. Martin Scorsese And Leonardo DiCaprio At Their Best.
","The Wolf Of Wall Street is an excellent and hilarious Black Comedy-Drama that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a great soundtrack making The Wolf Wall Street Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio at their best.Based on the book of the same name and set in New York City during the 1980s and 90s,The Wolf Of Wall Street tells the story of Jordan Belford(Leonardo DiCaprio),a Wall Street stockbroker who forms his own stock company and becomes more successful and living a life of money,drugs and excess. But as Jordan's life goes on he discovers that the F.B.I. and other forms of law enforcement are on his back which leads to Jordan's rise and fall.Martin Scorsese's The Wolf Of Wall Street is a brilliant,funny and over the top 3-hour black Comedy-Drama and is not only another Scorsese classic but another amazing collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio,it's a movie that is darkly humorous,truly demented and insane and very amoral and also tests your morality to the point where you can't take your eyes off the screen even if you want to. The Wolf Of Wall Street works not only as it's own film but also a terrific companion piece to Scorsese's Mob/Gangster classics Goodfellas and Casino in which The Wolf Of Wall Street are very similar to in style and storyline but whereas Goodfellas and Casino were about the violent lifestyles of Gangsters then The Wolf Of Wall Street is about the crazy lives of stockbrokers. Now,this isn't the first time that Scorsese has done a Comedy because years before he also did underrated films such as The King Of Comedy(1983)and After Hours(1985)but Scorsese goes even further with WOWS creating a movie that is energetic and satirical that you never know what's going to happen next with the story or it's characters and the Comedy is wild,funny and takes on a surrealistic tone that as viewer when you watch this film you will wonder did some of the stuff in the film actually happen. WOWS is a movie that will divide viewers and critics because of the characters actions and the many scenes of sex and drug use(which got the film an NC-17 rating before it was given an R-rating)some will feel Scorsese is glamorizing the lifestyle in the film. But I don't think Scorsese is really glamorizing anything in WOWS I think Scorsese is showing how success with some people can go so far that any person can fail and that is shown with Jordan Belfort because WOWS is not only a rise and fall tale but also a cautionary tale. The things that the characters in this do make the gangsters in Goodfellas and Casino look like model citizens in comparison. Scorsese and his editor the great Thelma Schoonmaker are masters at pacing and at 2 hrs and 59 minutes the movie goes by really fast and WOWS keeps you glued to the screen throughout making the three hour running feel like 90 minutes. The character Jordan Belfort is a character that viewers are going to love or hate you will love Jordan because of his ambitions to be huge and successful and you will hate Jordan for his own morality(or in this case amorality)with his excessive drug use,wanting more money which leads to his downfall. Most of the bizarre events in the film are seen from Jordan's P.O.V and you are along for a crazy thrill ride that never stops. When you watch WOWS you will ask is Jordan a tragic character or does he deserve his fate? It's a question you ask after the movie is over. The screenplay by Terrance Winter(creator of Boardwalk Empire)is amazing and very well-written,with Winter giving the movie great dialog and scenes that are funny and memorable and with Jordan's narration that speaks to the audience with a wild energy. The ending of The Wolf Of Wall Street is fantastic and effective showing viewers what happened to Jordan and gives viewers a bittersweet conclusion. A great ending.The whole cast is wonderful Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent and at his very best as Jordan Belfort,bringing intensity and wild energy to the performance. Jonah Hill is brilliant and funny as Donnie Azoff,Belfort's right hand man. Margot Robbie is wonderful and sexy as Naomi Belfort,Jordan's wife and has great scenes with DiCaprio. Matthew MoConaughey is terrific in his small role as Mark Hanna,a stockbroker who shows Jordan the ropes. Kyle Chandler(Agent Patrick Denham),Rob Reiner(Max Belfort),Jon Bernthal(Brad),Jon Favreau(Manny Riskin),Jean Dujardin(Jean Jacques Saurel),Joanna Lumley(Aunt Emma),Cristin Milioti(Teresa Petrillo)and Shea Whigham(Captain Ted Beecham)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is amazing with Scorsese bringing his trademark energy and style to the film with tracking overhead shots,close ups and freeze frames giving the movie a wonderful visual style. Fantastic direction,Scorsese.The soundtrack in the film outstanding composing of many Rock N'Roll songs that match the flow and tone of the movie. Great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Leonardo DiCaprio or cinema,I highly suggest you see The Wolf Of Wall Street,an excellent,hilarious and excessive Black Comedy-Drama that is Scorsese and DiCaprio at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,3,14,10 January 2014
Army of Darkness," An Action Packed,Hilarious Classic Finale To The Evil Dead Trilogy.
","Army Of Darkness is an excellent,Action packed,fun and Hilarious film filled with great direction,an excellent performance by Bruce Campbell,great Action,fun laughs,special effects and is a classic finale to the Evil Dead trilogy.Set in medieval times in 1300 A.D,hero Ash(Bruce Campbell)has been transported back to time and this time has to battle an army of dead skeletons,help a group of people and get the Necronomicon(Book Of The Dead)back so he can get back to his time,and for Ash it's going to be dangerous,full of adventure and will be groovy.What would happen if The Three Stooges met The Evil Dead? You would get Army Of Darkness,a classic film that is an absolute blast from beginning to end. What I love about Th Evil Dead Trilogy is that while all three films are connected with one another,they're different in terms of tone. If Evil Dead was pure Horror and Evil Dead II was a Horror-Comedy,then Army Of Darkness is in the Action/Comedy/Fantasy category with a little bit of Horror thrown in. The Comedy and laughs in the film are hilarious and ingenious and over the top with Sam Raimi using Three Stooges-style Comedy and slapstick in the film and with the character Ash being apart of the joke going through many bizarre and crazy things on his adventure. Ash's journey of trying to get the book of the dead is definitely one of the film's many great and funny highlights,seeing Ash's many reactions to the evil forces around him trying to stop him from getting the book of the dead and the things Ash goes through is over the top and funny. What is also funny is that Ash not only has to deal with evil spirits but also has to deal with the leader of medieval swordsmen to battle the army of the dead and it is hilarious how he teaches and leads the swordsmen how to battle and not act like cowards. Watching Ash being a leader is funny but you as a viewer are rooting for him all the way. AOD is also an homage and parody of films like Jason And The Argonauts and the original Clash Of The Titans in terms of cinematic style and influence,it's an homage to those films but a parody as well especially with the dead skeleton army which is an homage to special effects artist Ray Harryhausen. The skeleton army in the film and the way they're used is absurd and funny and having the army talk and react makes them even funnier. If you love Ray Harryhausen you will AOD. The Action and fight scenes in the film are well-done and fun and add to the film,because the Action isn't always serious to the point when you have to laugh at the wild energy and insanity during the Action scenes and throughout the film. Despite being a sequel to the first two Evil Dead films,some fans maybe a little disappointed to find out that AOD is the lightest film in the Evil Dead trilogy,meaning this film is less of a Horror film and more of Action/Comedy/Fantasy. Where the first two films were Horror films and had blood and gore,AOD was more of an adventure that didn't really need blood or gore because if AOD had that the film would've had a different tone to it and like I said before one of the things I love about the Evil Dead trilogy is that they're all different in tone,if you keep an open mind you'll love all the Evil Dead films including this one because like the first two film AOD has the same crazy and insane energy that the first two had. The ending of the film is a great,Action-packed and very exciting conclusion that will have viewers clapping and cheering at the screen and is one of the reasons that the Evil Dead films,Bruce Campbell and Ash are so legendary and iconic and in the immortal words of Ash it's...groovy.The cast does a great job. Bruce Campbell is excellent once again as Ash,bringing laughs,Action,toughness and great one-liners. Embeth Davidtz is wonderful and beautiful as Shelia,Ash's love interest. Marcus Gilbert gives a good performance as Lord Arthur and plays it straight. Ian Abercrombie is great as the Wiseman. Richard Grove is wonderful in his small role as Duke Henry The Red. Also lookout for cameos from Bridget Fonda(Linda)and Ted Raimi(S-Mart Store Clerk).The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent with Raimi with Raimi going nuts with the camera especially with the POV shots of the demons,the tilted angles and Raimi also does well with the Action scenes. Great job,Raimi.The score by Joseph LoDuca is wonderful and great sounding and fits in with the tone of the film. Great score. Also,lookout for a score cameo from Danny Elfman.The special make-up effects by K.N.B are well-done,memorable and very realistic. K.N.B does it again.In final word,if you love the first two Evil Dead's,Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell,Action,Comedy or Fantasy,you love Army Of Darkness,a classic film that is an great conclusion to an excellent trilogy. Highly Recommended 10/10.",10,2,3,18 February 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," An Excellent,Thrilling And Explosive Sequel. Bruce Willis And John McTierman At Their Best.
","Die Hard With A Vengeance is an excellent,thrilling and explosive sequel that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,dazzling Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Die Hard With A Vengeance a great Action sequel that is Bruce Willis and John McTierman at their best and is one of the best Action films of the 1990s.Set in New York City,Die Hard With A Vengeance has John McClane(Bruce Willis)who is now back in New York City as a NYPD cop and has to deal with a terrorist named Simon(Jeremy Irons)who is setting off bombs in the city and wants to play a game of Simon Says with John who is about to have a very bad day. Now,with the help of Harlem shop owner Zeus(Samuel L. Jackson)John McClane must put a stop to Simon and save the city.Die Hard With A Vengeance is a brilliant and thrilling Action sequel that reunited star Bruce Willis and director John McTierman(director of the first film)and created one of the best and most entertaining Action movies of the 1990s that was also my first introduction to the Die Hard series and the character John McClane and right behind the first film is my favorite Die Hard film. Die Hard With A Vengeance is an absolute blast from start to finish and is a movie that(literally)starts off with a bang instantly grabbing viewers by the throat and never letting go until the very end giving viewers a movie that is true Popcorn Movie,a film that is just memorable and fun. One of the things that makes DH3 so entertaining and watchable is the storyline because where as the first two films were set in one specific location(Nakatomi building Die Hard,Airport in Die Hard 2)DH3 takes the concept a step further using the entire city of New York as it's location which makes the movie more intense and exciting with a large scale and open space for creative scenes. Next to Bruce Willis New York City is pretty much the star of the movie and viewers see many locations of the Big Apple. The Action sequences in DH3 are amazing and intense and some of the biggest Action scenes in the Die Hard franchise with gunfights and explosions all around with the Action and thrills going at a terrific pace. DH3 is also an adventure in the truest sense of the word because there is chase sequences and various other things that happen throughout the film which will put viewers on the edge of their seats. While I did enjoy Die Hard 2 I felt the second film lacked some of the Comedic aspects of the first and thankfully the Humor was beck in this film. The Humor in DH3 is hilarious and is definitely on par with the first film in terms of laughs thanks to some of the dialog and moments in the film. The Comedy and Humor is also funny thanks to the pairing of the characters John McClane and Zeus who's back and forth banter is some of the funniest stuff you will see in a Die Hard movie and at times makes DH3 almost like a buddy Action Comedy which I think adds to the movie. When we see the character John McClane in this movie he is in a different position than he was in the first two films. In DH3 McClane is separated from his estranged wife,he's a cop on suspension and he's drunk with a bad hangover and is basically a guy down on his luck. Now,McClane has a chance to become a hero again and redeem himself by doing something he doesn't want to do:save the day and just like in the other Die Hard films we are rooting for John McClane. The ending in Die Hard With A Vengeance is terrific and filled with enough Action and excitement that will satisfy viewers. It's an ending that is not only true to Action movies but true to the whole Die Hard series. A great ending.The cast is wonderful. Bruce Willis is excellent once again as John McClane,with Willis being charismatic,cool and likable. Jeremy Irons is brilliant and unforgettable as terrorist Simon,with Irons commanding the screen in every scene he's in. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific and fun as Zeus and has great scenes and chemistry with Willis. Graham Greene(Joe Lambert),Collen Camp(Connie),Larry Bryggman(Walter Cobb),Anthony Peck(Ricky Walsh),Nick Wyman(Mathias Targo),Sam Phillips(Katya),Kevin Chamberlin(Charles Weiss),Sharon Washington(Officer Jane),Stephen Pearlman(Dr. Fred Schiller),Michael Alexander Jackson(Dexter),Aldis Hodge(Raymond),Charles Dumas(FBI Agent Andy Cross),Michael Cristofer(Bill Jarvis,from Another Organization)give good performances as well.The direction by John McTierman is fantastic,with McTierman always moving the camera and giving the movie a great pace and style and doing a terrific job with the Action scenes. Great direction,McTierman.The score by Michael Kamen is incredible,suspense and intense once again and matches the film perfectly. Fine score,Kamen. There is also the classic song Summer In The City by The Lovin' Spoonful that plays in the beginning of the film.In final word,if you love Bruce Willis,John McTierman or Action Movies.I highly suggest you see Die Hard With A Vengeance,an excellent,thrilling and explosive sequel that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,2,23 November 2014
Con Air," An Excellent,Action-Packed And Explosive Action-Thriller. Nicolas Cage And Jerry Bruckheimer At Their Best.
","Con Air is an excellent,Action-packed and explosive Action-Thriller that combines terrific direction,a wonderful all-star cast,outstanding Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Con Air not only one of my favorite Action Films but also of the best Action movies of the 1990s that is Nicolas Cage and Jerry Bruckheimer at their best.Con Air tells the story of United States Army Ranger Cameron Poe(Nicolas Cage)who after serving 8 years in prison for manslaughter is getting out on parole and going home to his wife and daughter and to get home he has to board a plane that transfers prisoners. Unfortunately for Cameron the plane is taken over by convict Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom(John Malkovich)and other prisoners. Now,Cameron with the help of U.S Marshall Vince Larkin(John Cusack) has to stop Cyrus save the say and get home to see his family.Con Air is a brilliant and exciting Action movie that was a Box Office hit in 1997 and is a film that I have loved ever since I saw it on Home Video during the late 1990s and in my opinion is not only one of the most enjoyable,watchable and defining Action movies of the 1990s but also one of the Nicolas Cage's and Jerry Bruckheimer's finest hours on the silver screen and is a big budget spectacle that is explosive as it is thrilling and is the true definition of a roller coaster ride that you just never want to end. Ranking alongside with The Rock(1996),Bad Boys(1995),Crimson Tide(1995),Enemy Of The State(1998),Black Hawk Down(2001),Top Gun(1986),Beverly Hills Cop I(1984 and II(1987)and Flashdance(1983)Con Air is one of the best productions from Jerry Bruckheimer. Con Air is one of those movies that whenever it's on television you just never turn it off and just gives viewers non-stop thrills and entertainment from start to finish and is the kind of movie you watch with a drink and popcorn. Con Air is a movie that is just re-watchable no matter how many times you watch it. This is a movie that has everything I love about Action films:great Action,memorable characters and great lines that are catchy all within a Die Hard type storyline with a very good twist,instead of terrorists taking over building it's prisoners taking over a plane. Another thing I also love about Con Air is that the movie never takes itself too seriously because it's a movie that is big,loud and over the top meaning that the film isn't going to win any Oscars,get tons of acclaim from major film critics or give viewers thought provoking story that is important,it's an Action movie for Action lovers. The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously because of the Humor thanks to the main and supporting characters(some who are straight forward and others who are weird and nutty)and with moments and scenes of wildness and fun. The Action scenes in Con Air are amazing,fast and intense and when you see the Action you don't want it to stop. There is tons of Action and more with gunfights,fist fights,explosions and heck there's even a car chase sequence and each of the Action scenes are big,in your face and done in Jerry Bruckheimer's style of quick and slow motion because like in any Jerry Bruckheimer production everything is far and beyond it's limits and the pace goes from 5 to 100 in seconds. The Action scenes will have Action fans glued to the screen and craving for more. The main character Cameron Poe is the tradition Action hero he's a one-man Army who is strong willed using his fists as well as his brains and can kick anyone's butt in the entire film but he's does it for a reason and that is to get home and see his wife and daughter. You also like Cameron because of his honor and loyalty to not only people but to certain principles and ideals that is true to his nature. You will root for Cameron Poe to survive and beat the bad guys. The ending of Con Air is outstanding and is filled with terrific Action and thrills that will have you cheering at the screen. A wonderful conclusion.The cast is wonderful. Nicolas Cage is excellent and at his best as Cameron Poe,with Cage kicking butt with a Southern accent and mullet. John Cusack is terrific as Vince Larkin,a U.S Marshall. John Malkovich is brilliant and at his best as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom,one of my favorite Action movie villains with Malkovich being charismatic and evil. Steve Buscemi is delightful as Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene,a serial killer. Ving Rhames is great as Nathan 'Diamond Dog',Cyrus' partner in crime. Colm Meaney is wonderful as Duncan Malloy,a DEA Agent. Rachel Ticotin(Guard Sally Bishop),Mykelti Williamson(Mike 'Baby-O' O'Dell),Danny Trejo(Johnny-23),Nick Chinlund(William Billy Bedlam Bedford),M.C Gainey(Swamp Thing),Dave Chapelle(Joe Pinball Parker),Monica Potter(Tricia Poe),Renoly(Sally Can't Dance),Jesse Borrergo(Francisco Cindino),Steve Easton(Guard Falzon),Jose Zuniga(DEA Agent Willie Sims)John Roelius(Skip),Angela Featherstone(Ginny),Landry Albright(Casey Poe)and more give good performances as well.The direction by Simon West is fantastic,with West bringing an energetic style and pace to the film while doing an incredible job with the Action scenes. Fine direction,West. There is also songs by Tricia Yearwood(How Do I Live)and the classic song by Lynyrd Skynyrd(Sweet Home Alabama).The score by Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin is great,big and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Nice score,Mancina and Rabin.In final word,if you love Action Films,Nicolas Cage or Jerry Bruckheimer,I highly suggest you see Con Air,an excellent,Action-packed and explosive Action-Thriller that you will watch again and again.

Jaws," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Unforgettable,Thrilling,Suspenseful And Terrifying Classic From Steven Spielberg.
","Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,thrilling and suspenseful classic that combines amazing direction,a wonderful cast and an iconic and terrifying film score and with those elements Jaws is one of my favorite films and is cinema and Steven Spielberg at their best.Based on the novel by Peter Benchley and set on the fictional town of Amity Island,Jaws tells the story of Martin Brody(Roy Schneider),the new Chief of Police in Amity who discovers that there is a great white shark attacking and killing people in the ocean and menacing the community of Amity. Out of options and nowhere to turn,Brody enlists the help of Biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss)and shark hunter and sea captain Quint(Robert Shaw)to hunt down the shark and kill it at all costs.What can be said about Jaws that hasn't been said before? It's one of the greatest and most iconic movies of all-time that is apart of Pop Culture,it was not only the first Summer Blockbuster but was the movie that also introduced film audiences to one of the greatest and most iconic Filmmakers of all-time in Steven Spielberg. Scary,frightening and unforgettable Jaws did for swimming in the water and ocean like Alfred Hitchcock's Masterpiece Psycho did for taking showers. Right from it's shocking and terrifying opening Jaws is a truly brilliant and amazing cinematic experience that keeps you glued to the screen with great intensity and power constantly putting viewers on the edge of their seats the whole time with white hot suspense that is like a tightrope and is an assault on the senses. The suspense and terror is Jaws is powerful and sensational and handled with great timing because the movie not only scares viewers with the idea of going into the water and being eaten by a shark but with fear of the unknown because we never see the giant shark that attacks but only the shark's point of view when it attacks for the first hour and the terror feels real. Spielberg and others have said that the shark didn't work right at first which was a blessing in disguise for the movie because it added to the intensity and dread of the film. The beauty of Jaws and why it's such a great film is the way the story is told and how the film is shown in two parts. The first half-hour is an examination in terror and fright giving viewers the set-up and showing us various characters while the shark terrorizes the beaches and waters putting you on the edge of your seat. The second half of Jaws is a sea Water Action-Adventure with Brody,Hooper and Quint trying to kill the shark while being on a boat in the sea with the same terror and fear of the first half. That's One of the things that I love about Jaws is that with those two different half's of the film the movie crosses into many different genres it's a Suspense-Thriller,a Sea Adventure,an Action movie and a Horror film all in one giving viewers the best of all of those genres with such excitement and great energy that never stops for over two hours. The three main characters in Jaws Brody,Quint and Hooper are some of the best characters in movie history and when you first see them you will love all three of them immediately and I think the main reason all three characters are likable is because they are real characters with humanity and depth and you will see that throughout the film. It's because of Brody,Quint and Hooper's humanity that when they are on the boat trying to kill the shark we are not only rooting for them but afraid for them as well because the three of them are in the ocean in the middle of nowhere trying to catch a shark where anything can happen. Brody,Quint and Hooper are three classic characters you will never forget. The shark in Jaws is one of the greatest villains in movie history not because the shark is an animal but because the shark is a killing machine who will not stop killing and you can't talk to it or ask for remorse because if Jaws sees humans or blood in the water the shark will eat and slaughter it's prey with no remorse or pity because the shark doesn't care one way or another. Jaws is a study of man vs nature and it is told in a classic and powerful way. The ending of Jaws is one of greatest and most intense endings in film history and you as a viewer will be thrilled,scared and happy with the results of what happens at the conclusion. A classic ending.The cast is amazing. Roy Scheider is excellent,memorable and heroic as Marcus Brody,with Scheider bringing depth and intensity to the role. Robert Shaw is brilliant and unforgettable as Quint,a sea captain. Richard Dreyfuss is terrific and humorous as Matt Hooper,the marine biologist. Scheider,Shaw and Dreyfuss are amazing and have great chemistry together. Lorainne Gray is fantastic as Ellen Brody,Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton is wonderful as Vaughn,the mayor of Amity.The direction by Steven Spielberg is brilliant and memorable,with Spielberg constantly moving the camera and bringing a great atmosphere and intensity especially during the scenes involving the shark. Terrific direction,Spielberg.The score and theme by John Williams is outstanding,frightening and iconic and one of the most famous scores in film history,with Williams' score being intense,scary and adventurous. Classic score,Williams.In final word,if you love Steven Spielberg or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Jaws,an excellent,suspenseful and terrifying classic that you can watch again and again and will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,5,3 March 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful,Unforgettable Masterpiece.
","The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,brilliant performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful and memorable score. All of those elements make The Shawshank Redemption not only one of the best Stephen King adaptations but a movie that is cinema at it's best.Based on the Novella Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King,The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins),a banker who is serving two life prison sentences for killing his wife and lover(although he claims he's innocent)at Shawshank prison. While at the prison Andy meets fellow inmate Red(Morgan Freeman)a man who can get things inside and the two form a long friendship while dealing with life in Shawshank prison.Released in 1994,The Shawshank Redemption is a truly brilliant and outstanding film that was the directorial debut of Frank Darabont and his first feature film adaptation of a Stephen King tale. Despite receiving rave reviews from critics and earning 7 Academy Award nominations The Shawshank Redemption wasn't a huge hit at the Box Office and was overshadowed by other classic movies released the same year such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. But thanks to television showings and success on Home Video The Shawshank Redemption became a classic and one of the most memorable movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is an instant classic the first time you watch it and is a movie that is powerful and dramatic,meaningful and gripping,uplifting and sad as well as humorous and light. All of those elements give Shawshank Redemption an emotional weight that reminds viewers why film is such a beautiful art form because it's a film where just everything works from the direction,acting and writing where everything is flawless. The Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie that has some of the grit and brutality of other prison movies but the storyline is much different and unpredictable than other prison films with messages and themes that are repeated throughout such as hope,life and optimism despite being in prison and dealing with the hardships. It's rare to see or hear such themes talked about in a prison movie but that is one of the things that makes Shawshank stand out from the other movies in the prison genre. Shawshank also shows viewers what a talented and versatile writer Stephen King truly is showing us that King can not do Horror and Science Fiction but can also do Drama. Shawshank along with other great Stephen King adaptations such as The Green Mile and Stand By Me are prime examples that King can do Drama. Shawshank also deals with not only prison life but also the passage of time going from the 1940s to the 1960s with posters of beautiful and sexy actresses such as Rita Hayworth,Marliyn Monroe and Raquel Welch showing that while time stands still in prison the world can move pretty fast. The pace of this movie is just terrific going by fast making you feel like you're watching a 90 minute film than a 2 and half hour one. The screenplay by Frank Darabont is amazing and memorable with dialog that is fresh and powerful as well as memorable and thoughtful. Shawshank's two main characters Andy and Red are classic characters who are the anchors of the film showing viewers the kind of friendship that lasts a long time. Andy and Redd look at prison life in different ways,Andy despite serving a life sentence believes that there is still hope beyond the prison walls and no one not the warden or the guards can't touch inside of him. Whereas Red is opposite and more cynical believe there is just prison life and that's all there is. However,despite their opposite ways of thinking Andy and Red's friendship and bond is strong and grows as the film goes on and when you see these two throughout the movie you will feel that there is redemption and hope for Andy and Red. Andy and Red is one of the best depictions of friendship in movie history and you will never forget these characters after the film is over. The final 20-30 minutes of The Shawshank Redemption is one of greatest endings ever seen on film because there is surprises and happiness that will make you smile and cry with joy. A masterful conclusion.The cast is outstanding. Tim Robbins is excellent and at his best as Andy Dufresne,with Robbins bringing a power and emotional depth to the performance. Morgan Freeman is brilliant and his best as well as Red,Andy's best friend and prison mate. Robbins and Freeman are magical together and have great scenes. Bob Gunton is fantastic and memorable as Wardon Norton,a corrupt prison Wardon. William Sadler is terrific and funny as Heywood,Andy and Red's friend and fellow prisoner. Clancy Brown is amazing and menacing as Captain Hadley,a Shawshank's brutal guard. Gil Bellows is sensational as Tommy,a young convict. James Whitmore is outstanding as Brooks,an old timer and prisoner. Mark Rolston(Bogs),Larry Brandenburg(Skeet),Brian Libby(Floyd),Neil Giuntoli(Jigger),David Proval(Snooze),Joseph Ragno(Ernie)and Jeffrey McDunn(1946 D.A)give good performances as well.The direction by Frank Darabont is fantastic and stunning,with Darabont moving the camera with tracking shots,low angles with beautiful and harsh lighting. Great direction,Darabont.The score by Thomas Newman is terrific,beautiful and epic and is fits with the movie's tone. Incredible score,Newman.In final word,if you love Tim Robbins,Morgan Freeman,Frank Darabont,Stephen King,Prison Films or movies in general,I highly suggest you see The Shawshank Redemption,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you can watch again and again and is cinema at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,0,11 January 2015
The Conjuring," An Excellent,Scary,Terrifying And Suspenseful Supernatural Horror Film. James Wan At His Best.
","The Conjuring is an excellent,scary and suspenseful Supernatural Horror film that combines amazing direction,a great cast,non-stop terror and a creepy,intense score elements that make The Conjuring a great Horror film and is James Wan at his best.Based on a true story and set in 1971,The Conjuring tells the story of Carolyn and Roger Perron(Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston)who along with their five daughters have moved into a new house on the countryside of Rhode Island. While the Perron's are in their new house,the family discovers that the them and the house are being haunted by ghosts and evil spirits. With nowhere to turn,the Perron's ask for the help of Lorraine and Ed Warren(Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson),paranormal investigators to get rid of the evil spirits and save their family.The Conjuring is an amazing and frightening Supernatural Horror film that right from the beginning puts viewers on edge giving people a scary and emotional experience that no one will ever forget. The Conjuring is also an old school Horror movie in the truest sense because it's a movie that takes us back to the Supernatural Horror films of the 1970s and 80s combining a ghost story with a demonic possession story mixing together and combining elements of classics such as The Shining(1980),Poltergeist(1982),The Haunting(1963)with The Exorcist(1973)and The Evil Dead(1982). And While The Conjuring doesn't nessarily reinvent the Supernatural Horror sub genre,the movie gives a fresh and entertaining take on the haunted house genre. Another thing the is old school about The Conjuring is the movie's scares and suspense which are effective and done with great timing and detail with intense build-up that grabs you by the throat. Director James Wan uses simple things to make the film creepy whether it's someone or something knocking on wood,moving doors,showing things from a distance giving viewers a sense of dread. The jump scares are not just in The Conjuring because it's a Horror movie but are in the film because they have meaning and power. Another thing that I love about The Conjuring is the way the movie uses atmosphere to make the movie scary using the darkness,haunting sounds and the characters reactions to the chaos going on all around which adds to the film's dark tone and the movie works greatly without blood and gore(although there is a couple of bloody moments in the film). Don't get me wrong while I love blood and gore in Horror movies,The Conjuring didn't need or require it because the whole film is about messing with you mentally than physically. You can almost say that The Conjuring is a continuation of James Wan's other haunted house movie before this one the terrific Insidious which shares some similarities with this film. At 112 minutes The Conjuring moves at a steady pace and there is never a dull moment and when watch the film you will be craving for more. One of the great things about The Conjuring is that this film is more of a character driven Horror movie like The Exorcist,Poltergeist or The Sixth Sense because with The Conjuring there is enough time and length for viewers to get to know the main characters in the Warren's and Parron's. While we don't get to know about the past history of the two couples but we see enough to feel sympathy for the Warren's and Parron's because when the scary stuff starts to happen we want them to survive. What makes the Warren's and Parron's great characters is that they don't feel like Slasher movie stock characters waiting to get killed off in the first 15 minutes but feel like real people dealing with a drastic situation. I love that the movie takes it's time with build-up not only with the scares and suspense but also with the characters which in my opinion makes the movie effective and makes The Conjuring a great and remarkable film. The ending of The Conjuring is terrific,scary and at the same time surprising because it's open ended leaving viewers with questions rather than answers.The cast is outstanding. Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson are excellent and memorable as Lorraine and Ed Warren,the paranormal investigators. Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston are brilliant as Carolyn and Roger Parron,the couple who's house is haunted. Shanley Caswell(Andrea),Hayley McFarland(Nancy),Joey King(Christine),Mackenzie Foy(Cindy),Klya Deaver(April)and Sterling Jerins(Judy Warren)do wonderful jobs as the kids in the film. Shannon Kook(Drew)and John Brotherton(Brad)give good performances as well.The direction by James Wan is brilliant and stylish,with Wan always moving the camera with tracking shots,hand-held movements and creative angles giving the movie a creepy and frightening atmosphere. Great job,Wan.The score by Joseph Bishara is terrific,haunting and intense and matches the movie's scary energy. Memorable score,Bishara.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Supernatural movies or James Wan,I highly suggest you see The Conjuring,an excellent,scary and suspenseful Horror film that is James Wong at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,19,32,6 March 2014
Scream," An Excellent,Scary And Funny Horror/Slasher Classic. Wes Craven At His Best.
","Scream is an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic and one of the greatest Horror films of all-time that is filled with amazing direction,a wonderful cast,a terrific script and a creepy and memorable score. All of the elements make Scream an unforgettable Horror film and is Wes Craven at his best.Scream tells the story of Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell),a teen who on the one year anniversary of her mother's death discovers that a killer with a ghost face mask is stalking and killing people in her home town. When Sidney finds out she's next on the list Sidney has to try and stop the killer and stay alive.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen as dead by most critics and audiences I wouldn't say the genre was dead but was more in a coma and waiting to wake up and the film that woke up the Horror genre was Wes Craven's Scream,a brilliant Horror movie that was not only a critical and Box Office hit but also made the Horror genre hot again and paved the way for other slasher films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer(1997)and Urban Legend(1998). Right from the movie scary and now famous 10-15 minute sequence,Scream is an amazing and terrifying Horror movie that takes the Slasher genre and toys around with the Slasher movie giving us a film that is not only scary but also funny,smart and clever giving viewers a film that rethinks the Slasher genre while paying homage to Slasher films of the past. Scream is one of the few films I can think of that mixes Horror and Humor flawlessly with intelligence. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Scream are done with powerful and explosive intensity that punches you right in the face and during the scary scenes none of the characters are never safe or secure with violence in the air. The violence and gore that happens during the scary scenes are horrific and disturbing and reminds me of the in your face brutality of his earlier classics such as A Nightmare On Elm Street(1984),The Last House On The Left(1972)and The Hills Have Eyes(1977)because like those films Craven shows us the disgusting view and doesn't hold back one bit. The Comedy and Humor is funny and at times hilarious because it seems like the teenage characters know that they're in a Horror film are self aware and know all of the Clichés and things that happen in a slasher film(or all of the rules in order to survive a Horror film)which is in line with the post-modern film making of the 1990s. Scream also features terrific and fun references to landmark Horror classics such as Psycho(1960),A Nightmare On Elm Street,Halloween(1978)and Friday The 13th(1980)and some of the references are obvious while others are subtle. The balance of Horror and Humor makes the movie more intense and unforgettable. Sidney Prescott is one of the great Horror movie scream queens/heroines and that's mainly because like the other scream queens of the past Sidney is tough and can handle herself and you root for her to survive despite the viciousness all around her and when you see her going through terror you will relate to her. The Ghost face killer is a classic villain in the Horror genre because what sets this killer apart from other killers in the genre is that the killer calls on the phone and uses Horror movie knowledge to test the victim and if get the answers wrong Ghost face will kill you with no remorse. The Ghost Face killer will have you on edge when you see Scream the first time and will stick with you and you can say was one of the reasons caller ID was invented. Much of the film's success of Scream is thanks to the screenplay by Kevin Williamson which is amazing,terrific and in my opinion one of the best screenplays in Horror film history. Williamson script is filled with great dialog that is clever,ironic and done with a style that has been imitated but never duplicated. Williamson fills his script with Horror,Mystery,Comedy and Drama all within 112 minutes and giving viewers a unique story that never slows sown. Williamson has never topped his Scream script and I don't think he ever will. The ending of Scream is a classic conclusion that is filled with twists,turns and thrills that will catch you off guard and add to the movie's greatness. An outstanding ending.The cast is incredible. Neve Campbell is excellent as Sidney,one of the great Horror movie heroines,with Campbell bringing toughness,sympathy and depth to the role. Courtney Cox is wonderful as Gale Weathers,a heartless News reporter. Skeet Ulrich is terrific as Billy,Sidney's boyfriend. David Arquette is great and funny as Deputy Dewey. Rose McGowan is fantastic and sexy as Tatum,Sidney's best friend. Jamie Kennedy is outstanding and hilarious as Randy,a movie geek. Matthew Lillard is delightful as Stuart,Tatum's boyfriend. W.Earl Brown(Kenny)and Joseph Whipp(Sheriff Burke)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for credited and uncredited cameos by Liev Schreiber(Cotton Weary),Linda Blair(Obnoxious News reporter),Wes Craven(Fred The Janitor)and Henry Winkler(Principal Arthur Himbry).The direction by Wes Craven is amazing,with Craven always moving the camera and bringing a thrilling and intense style to the film. Wonderful direction,Craven.The score by Marco Beltrami is sensational,suspenseful and intense and adds to the atmosphere to the film. Great score,Beltrami.In final word,if you love Wes Craven,Horror films or Slasher films,I highly suggest you see Scream,an excellent,scary and funny Horror classic that you will never forget and will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,1,14 April 2014
Halloween," An Absolute Classic of the Horror Genre. John Carpenter At His Best.
","John Carpenter's Halloween is a flawless horror classic from beginning to end and is one the films that defined modern horror and is one of the scariest movies of all time.Halloween tells the tale of a young boy named Michael Myers at the age of six in 1963 in the small town of Haddenfield,Illinois on Halloween night stabbed and murder his sister and is sent to a Mental Hospital. Fifteen years later Michael Myers escapes from the hospital and is killing again on Halloween night while stalking three teenage girls that includes Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis). The only person that can stop Myers is his doctor Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasence).Halloween is a timeless Horror classic that set the standard for the Horror/Slasher genre and spawned many imitators and it did for the Horror/Slasher genre like The Godfather did for Gangster films or 2001:A Space Odyssey did for the SCI-FI genre. Halloween and it's influence was imitated but never duplicated One of The main reasons Halloween is a classic that it is is because the storyline is so simple yet so terrifying. Director John Carpenter gives viewers a film that right from the beginning is a scary and frightening tale of terror that grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the very end. Where as later Slasher films depended on blood and gore to terrify audiences Carpenter and Halloween uses very simple techniques such as jump scares and suspense to great effect and truly frightens viewers. While I love blood and gore in Horror films I also love suspense and build-ups to scares and violence and that's one of the reasons Halloween works. What I also love about Halloween is the lighting and tone that Carpenter has in this film. The photography and lighting by Dean Cundey is brilliant giving the film an intense dark and claustrophobic nightmarish feel with natural during the day and frightening,surreal lighting at night using dark shadows where you feel that no character in the film is safe. Michael Myers is easily one of the greatest villains of the history of cinema and what makes Michael Myers so scary and frightening is that there are no answers,reasons,explanations or logic to why Michael Myers kills people. We all know why other Horror villains and cinema icons Freddy Kruger(A Nightmare On Elm Street series)and Jason Voorhees(Friday The 13th series)but we never know why Michael kills. Carpenter doesn't show Michael Myers as a human being but as a bogeyman,a shape,an unstoppable force of nature that can not be stopped,talked to or reasoned with and shows no feelings or emotions showing no pity,remorse or fear and will never stop what he's doing no matter what. Michael Myers is a classic villain and the true definition of evil. During the day scenes Carpenter smartly shows Michael Myers from a distance and from the points of view of the main characters with the points of view not showing Myers a lot but giving the viewer enough terror and dread. However,during the night scenes when Michael Myers is stalking his prey Carpenter gives us more close-ups of Michael Myers' face that is highly lightened in the shadows. You feel like Michael Myers is a character that is pretty much everywhere and all over the place and can strike anywhere,anytime whether it's day or night and that's very scary. Halloween also shows viewers that even in the environment of the suburbs no one is safe from the horrific wrath and destruction of Michael Myers. The film's two other main characters Dr. Sam Loomis and Laurie Strode are great characters who are heroic and have enough depth and sympathy to make you root for them when the bad things start to happen and work as memorable protagonists opposite Michael Myers. The ending of Halloween is brilliant and a classic John Carpenter ending that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats and makes viewers ask a lot questions and never gives viewers many answers. I think the ending tells viewers that you can try to stop evil,but evil never,ever fully goes away and that is one of the reasons Halloween is an amazing classic.The cast does a great job in their roles. Donald Pleasence is excellent as Dr.Sam Loomis and brings a calm,quiet demeanor to the performance. Pleasence's monologue about Michael Myers is one of the film's great moments. Jamie Lee Curtis(in her film debut)is wonderful as Laurie Strode making Laurie sweet,likable and sympathetic. It's no wonder Curtis was a scream queen in the late 70s and early 80s. Nick Castle is excellent as Michael Myers,one of the greatest villains of all time. Castle walks slowly,stares at people,tilts his head and wears that frightening white masks that defines evil. Castle's performance set the standard for slasher movie villains. Nancy Kyes(Annie),P.J Soles(Linda),Charles Cyphers(Sheriff Brackett),Brian Andrews(Tommy)and Kyle Richards(Lindsey)also do well in their roles as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant,giving the film tension and creepiness,moving the camera and showing the small town and neighborhood during the day and night,while also doing great with the scary and suspenseful scenes and also does a great job with the Michael Myers point of view shots. Great direction.The score by John Carpenter is one of the scariest,terrifying scores of all time and is so iconic. The opening theme is so effective and scary that it will be stuck in your head after you watch the film. The theme and score is classic and one of the things that makes the film.Halloween is simply a Horror classic,one of the greatest films ever made and one of John Carpenter's best. If you love Horror films or films in general see this movie. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,1,27 June 2012
Back to the Future Part II," An Excellent,Unforgettable Sequel And A Classic.
","Back To The Future Part II is an excellent and unforgettable sequel and classic that combines amazing direction,a wonderful cast,a fantastic script,a terrific score and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future Part II while not as good as the first film,a great sequel in the Back To The Future series.Set after the events in the first film,Back To The Future Part II finds Marty(Michael J. Fox)and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)time traveling to the future in 2015. When Marty and Doc return to 1985,they discover that Hill Valley in 1985 has become a dark wasteland thanks to Biff(Thomas F. Wilson)who took the time machine and altered 1985. Now,Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955,stop Biff and go back to their lives as they remember it.After the worldwide Box Office success of the original Back To The Future in 1985,it seem obvious that there would be a sequel which would come four years later with Back To The Future Part II a brilliant and entertaining sequel(which was filmed back to back with Part III)that was a Box office hit and is a film that is just memorable and fun from start to finish. Making a sequel to a classic film like Back To The Future is no easy task,but director Robert Zemeckis has crafted a movie that while giving viewers more of the same laughs,adventure and thrills like the original while also giving Back To The Future fans something that feels fresh and exciting at the same time standing on it's own two feet while being a sequel to the first movie. The Comedy and laughs in Back To The Future Part II are funny,hilarious and on par with the original and not a moment is wasted. The scenes with the iconic Deloren car(this time flying instead of driving)are still amazing and will keep viewers thrilled and entertained. The screenplay by Bob Gale is wonderful with dialog and scenes that make the movie feel alive and imaginative. Back To The Future Part II is a film that brings back some of the characters from the first film like Marty,Doc Biff,Loraine and others and takes the concept of time travel from the first movie and gives it a clever story line on a much larger and bigger scale playing with the very serious consequences and repercussions of time-traveling with Marty and Doc going to the future,the present and then the past showing that while time traveling can be fascinating and interesting time traveling can be dangerous if used in the wrong way with Marty and Doc finding out the hard way. When Marty and Doc travel to the future in 2015 to help with Marty's kids Hill Valley's future is optimistic and bright with advanced technology and flying cars while Marty's future isn't so bright. But when the duo go back to 1985 they discover that they are in an alternate Dystopian 1985 where violence and crime is up in Hill Valley and Biff is running the town. The scenes in the alternate 1985 give BTTF II a dark tone that is sinister showing that even the smallest events can change anything. I love the fact that in Part II that Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to repair 1985 as they remember it and as viewers we see some of the events from the first film showed in this one with some minor alterations. The story for BTTF PT II may have the most complex story of the three film but the movie won't be hard to follow. The ending of Back To The Future Part II is a terrific and memorable cliffhanger ending that has surprises and thrills which sets viewers up for the final chapter in the series in Back To The Future Part III. AN amazing ending.The cast is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent and brilliant once again as Marty McFly(and multiple roles)and Doc Brown,with the two bring laughs and wonderful chemistry. Lea Thompson is terrific as Lorraine,Marty's Mother. Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as Biff and Griff,Biff's grandson. Elisabeth Shue(replacing Claudia Wells)is good as Jennifer,Marty's girlfriend. James Tolkan is great once again as Strickland,the hard nose teacher. Casey Siemazko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),J.J Cohen(Skinhead),Charles Fleischer(Terry)and Flea(Needles)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by a young Elijah Wood as Video Game Boy.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is fantastic with Zemeckis bringing the same energy and style he brought to the first film. Amazing direction,Zemeckis.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding with Silvestri's score being epic and intense matching the movie greatly. Fantastic score,Silvestri.The Special effects by Industrial,Light and Magic are dazzling and mind blowing once again. Nice job,ILM.In final word,if you love Robert Zemeckis or the first film,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future Part II,an excellent and unforgettable sequel that will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,4,9 December 2015
Carrie," An Excellent,Scary And Suspenseful Horror Classic With A Brilliant Performance From Sissy Spacek. Brian De Palma And Stephen King At Their Best.
","Carrie is one of the greatest Horror Films ever made,an Excellent,Scary and suspenseful Horror classic that is filled with amazing direction,great performances from Sissy Spacek and the rest of the cast,a fantastic script and a beautiful,haunting film score. All those elements make Carrie a classic and Brian De Palma and Stephen King at their best.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name,Carrie tells the story of Carrie White(Sissy Spacek),a quiet and shy 17-year-old girl who is bullied and tormented by her High School classmates and lives with her Mother Margaret White(Piper Laurie),a religious fanatic. While at school,Carrie discovers she has telekinetic powers,an ability to move things with her mind. Later,Carrie is asked to the prom by popular classmate Tommy Ross(William Katt). Unfortunately,Carrie and Tommy don't know that there is a prank planned for Carrie at the prom and the prank will lead to deadly and tragic consequences. Carrie is an brilliant film from beginning to end and was an amazing breakthrough film for director Brian De Palma and Author Stephen King because it was the first big box office hit for De Palma and the first Stephen King adaptation to the big screen while also being one of the all time great Horror movie classics and one of the best Stephen King adaptations. Carrie is a great movie that is very scary,powerful and truly suspenseful,intense and dramatic,stylish and tragic and is a movie that will haunt you not just physically but mentally as well from the first time you watch it. I think one of the reasons Carrie is not only a Horror classic but a classic film in general is the way it deals with themes such as bullying,revenge,being an outcast,wanting to be accepted by your peers as well as dealing with the strings and arrows of teenage life and all of those themes in the film will always be relevant and timeless because there will always be bullying and feelings of being an outcast among people of all ages. Carrie is scary and suspenseful because this film deals with monsters not Zombies,Vampires or large Werewolves but a monster of a different kind:human beings. While there are good human beings in the film like Carrie and a few other people, the other human beings in the film are evil beyond redemption because of the things the evil characters do to Carrie. The film is also scary in the situations and haunting imagery that director Brian De Palma shows which is very nightmarish and dream like that makes the movie frightening,disturbing and atmospheric. The suspense in Carrie is done with great build-up the most suspenseful sequence in the film being the now famous prom scene which is one of the greatest scenes in movie history. What's amazing about the prom scene is the way De Palma builds the tension with the prom scene with Horror,romance,terror and dread all at once and when the build-up stops there is a terrific pay off that is scary and powerful. The prom scene and the whole film in general is a Cinderella story with a Brian De Palma and Stephen King twist. Carrie is a movie that also works as a great character study of Carrie White one of the finest and iconic characters in the history of movies and literature. Right from the very start of the film we as a viewer relate with Carrie because like Carrie most of us have been outcasts,had no friends or have been bullied to the point where we want revenge on our tormentors. When we see the relationship with Carrie's Mother we sympathize with Carrie because of the torture she goes through living with her Mother and we root for Carrie succeed and not to live in fear. Carrie is a classic character that you will never forget and one of cinemas definitive outcasts and anti hero's. The screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen is terrific and mostly stays true to Stephen King's book while taking out the Crime Drama flashback element of the novel and making the story leaner and meatier. The ending of Carrie is amazing and one of the scariest and greatest endings in movie history that will shock and chill you to the bone and make you jump out of your seat. A classic ending.The whole cast is great. Sissy Spacek gives an excellent,unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance as Carrie White,with Spacek bringing depth,sympathy and sadness to the role. A powerful performance by Spacek. Piper Laurie is brilliant in her Oscar nominated role as Carrie's Mother Margaret White,with Laurie being scary,terrifying and having great scenes with Spacek. Amy Irving is wonderful as Sue Snell,a classmate that wants to help Carrie. William Katt is terrific as Tommy Ross,Sue's boyfriend and Carrie's prom date. Nancy Allen is great as Chris,one of Carrie's bullies. John Travolta(in his film debut)is outstanding and funny as Billy,Chris' boyfriend. Betty Buckley is fantastic as Miss Collins,Carrie's coach. P.J Soles is fun and memorable as Norma,one of Chris' friends.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera and bringing a haunting and beautiful visual style to the film. De Palma also uses his trademark split screen shots for one of the suspenseful scenes in the film. Amazing direction,De Palma.The score by Pino Donggaio is fantastic,haunting,beautiful,intense and truly adds to the film's nightmarish tone. Powerful score,Donggaio.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Brian De Palma,Stephen King,Sissy Spacek,or films in general,I highly suggest you see,an excellent,scary and suspenseful Horror classic that is Brian De Palma and Stephen King at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,3,23 November 2013
Raging Bull," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful And Unforgettable Masterpiece From Martin Scorsese And Robert De Niro
","Raging Bull is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable Masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing direction,powerful acting,beautiful music and stunning photography. All of those elements make Raging Bull Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro and Film making at their best.Based on the book of the same name and set from the 1940s to the 1960s,Raging Bull tells the true story of Jake LaMotta(Robert De Niro),a middleweight Boxer who is successful and rising to the top in the Boxing ring and wants to become the middleweight champion of the world. While Jake is doing well in the ring his personal life and troubled relationships with his wife Vicki(Cathy Moriarty)and brother Joey(Joe Pesci)lead to Jake's rise and fall in and out of the ring.Released in 1980,Raging Bull despite being a modest Box Office success and receiving eight Academy Award nominations and winning two for best actor(Robert De Niro)and Best editing(Thelma Shoonmaker)received mixed reviews from critics because the violence and language and lost the Oscars for Best Picture and Director to Robert Redford's Ordinary People which is a fine film in it's own right. But overtime Raging Bull is now seen as a masterpiece and not only one of the greatest films ever made but also the greatest film of the 1980s. Right from it's terrific opening credits and first scene,Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is a brilliant and powerful masterpiece on so many levels from the acting,direction and everything else is one the main reasons I love cinema so much. The movie is a great combination biopic,sports drama and art film giving viewers a movie that is both beautiful and ugly as well as brutal and harsh at the same time. Raging Bull was one of the last if not the last great film that came from the New Hollywood era that lasted from the late 60s into the 1970s even though the movie was released in 1980. The Black and White photography by Michael Chapman is fantastic,visually stunning and truly adds to the film giving the movie an accurate and stylish look to the 1940s and 50s as well the scenes inside and out of the Boxing ring. Chapman also uses smoke and lighting to great effect not giving the movie an incredible atmosphere but reflecting the characters state of mind. What also makes Raging Bull an outstanding film is the editing by Scorsese veteran Thelma Schoonmaker. The editing by Schoonmaker is sensational because we get freeze frames,fast cuts which give the movie a great pace and quickness that was ahead of it's time and holds up years later. The Boxing scenes in Raging Bull are thrilling,amazing and some of the bloodiest and most graphic Boxing scenes ever caught on film and directed with terrific skill,detail with Actions and sound effects and when every punch is thrown you not only hear the punches you feel them as well and there is devastating impact with each of the fight scenes. What I also love about each of the Boxing scenes is that all of them have a different tone and style with Scorsese mixing realism and exaggeration. The violence in Raging Bull is shocking and at times horrific and will disturb viewers but the violence fits with the movie's tone and spirit. Although the movie has Boxing the movie is more about the man Jake LaMotta than his profession. The portrayal of Jake LaMotta will obviously divide viewers when they watch the film because on one hand we feel sorry for Jake and some of the things he has to endure but on the other hand viewers will dislike Jake because of his abuse to his wife and self-destructive ways bringing his brutality outside of the ring. We also see Jake brought down by his own insecurities and paranoia which makes his rise and fall much more tragic. One of the reasons Raging Bull is amazing because it's not really a Boxing but more of a character study. The ending of Raging Bull is amazing and memorable because it gives Jake LaMotta a new beginning that is optimistic and positive. Will you feel differently about Jake LaMotta at the end? The movie greatly asks viewers that question and makes viewers answer the question themselves. A terrific and unforgettable ending.The cast is amazing. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of finest acting performances in film history and gives his greatest performance as Jake LaMotta,with De Niro bringing emotion,intensity and anger to his Oscar winning role role. Cathy Moriarty is terrific,beautiful and sexy and Vicki LaMotta,Jake's second wife and holds her own against De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant and fiery as Joey LaMotta,Jake's younger brother and has great scenes with De Niro. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Salvy,Joey's friend. Nicolas Colasanto is outstanding as Tommy Como,a Mob Boss that wants to help Jake. Mario Gallo(Mario),Theresa Saldana(Lenore)and Lori Anne Flax(Irma)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant,powerful and some of best directing in movie history,with Scorsese using zooms,wide,high and low angle shots,a great tracking shot,close ups and use of slow motion while doing an amazing with the Boxing scenes. Outstanding direction,Scorsese.The classic music by Pietro Mascagni is beautiful,mesmerizing and memorable and fits with the images and tone of the movie. Great music.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro or movies in general,I highly suggest you see Raging Bull,an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that deserves to be in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,2,1 August 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A Brilliant,Masterful Epic Conclusion To The Dark Knight Trilogy.
","The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant,excellent and masterful epic conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy. Filled with excellent direction,wonderful performances,great Action and epic storytelling,The Dark Knight Rises is Christopher Nolan at his best.Set eight years after the events in The Dark Knight,Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has been a recluse and retired as Batman and Gotham City has been at peace as well as safe and quiet. But when a new threat and terrorist named Bane(Tom Hardy)comes into Gotham City and threatens to destroy and demolish Gotham,Batman must come out of retirement to fight and face Bane and save the city of Gotham from destruction.The Dark Knight Rises is a powerful and unforgettable conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy,it is a film that loved since I saw it in theaters and I cannot understand why the film has gotten a mixed to negative reception with most Batman fans. I guess because this film came out after Nolan's other films The Dark Knight and Inception which raised the bar really high when it comes to filmmaking and were universally loved by everyone and comparing this film with the other two this film can be seen as letdown for most people but not to me. The Dark Knight Rises is an Epic in the truest since of the word because Nolan has created a film that is big not only in length(2 Hours and 45 minutes)but in scope as well bringing everything to higher level whether it's the Action or the storyline. The film was so epic it probably would be longer with an overture like the epics of the 50s and 60s. Most of the time the third film in the trilogy is usually seen as the weakest but Nolan is a smart filmmaker who knows that if you are going to complete a trilogy you have to go out with a huge bang and TDKR goes out with not only a bang but with explosions. What I love about TDK Trilogy is that while all of them are three connected films all them are different in story. If Batman Begins is an origin story and Action/Adventure and The Dark Knight is a Crime Drama then TDKR can be described as a War Film. TDKR is War Film in sense where there are armies rising and gangs are controlling the streets with power,guns and tanks and Gotham is divided like a Civil War between the rich and poor or cops and criminals. With the theme of War and control running throughout the film you pulled into a Dystopian nightmare where Gotham City is being held hostage and not the cops or government can do anything about it and the only person that can do anything about is Batman. In TDKR we see not only the physical but also the mental toll being Batman has had on Bruce Wayne. Bruce has become broken down and a recluse and the damage of being Batman has affected his friendships and relationships or lack there of. Bane is such a great villain because where The Joker in TDK wanted to make people evil and corrupt and wanted to burn Gotham,Bane wants the people of Gotham to take control and take back the city of Gotham from the corrupt and the rich and create a revolution and army and still wants to destroy Gotham City. Bane is villain unlike Batman has ever faced before because Bane can match Batman on no only a physical level but on an intelligence level as well. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and like the first two films are done in a realistic way. Each Action scene is handled with a great deal of suspense and build up and this time it is done on an big scale to match the epic feel of the film. When the Action in the film happens you are glued to the screen and mesmerized. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and it will blow you away with it's filmmaking and craft. The ending will have you cheering and smiling and it is a great conclusion to this film and The Dark Knight Trilogy. The cast does an excellent jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent in his final performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing the same depth and intensity to the role. Tom Hardy is simply brilliant and scary as Bane,with using his voice,eyes and body language for the performance. Hardy's performance in my opinion makes Bane one of the best villains in film history. Gary Oldman is great once again as Jim Gordan,with Oldman bringing cynicism and depth to the role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Blake,an idealistic rookie cop. Anne Hathaway is wonderful and sexy as Catwoman/Selina Kyle and has great scenes with Bale. Marion Cotillard does a great job as Miranda,Bruce's other love interest. Morgan Freeman excels once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Michael Caine is amazing once again as Alfred. Caine's final scenes with Bale are powerful and well-acted. Matthew Modine(Foley)and Ben Mendelsohn(Daggett)give good performances as well.The direction by Christopher Nolan is excellent and brilliant,with Nolan always moving the camera and having great shots and camera angles and giving the film an epic feel and Nolan does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction by Nolan.The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and intense and matches the dark and epic tone of the film. A great memorable score by Zimmer.In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Dark Knight Rises,a brilliant,masterful and epic conclusion to an excellent trilogy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,10,17,2 May 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," An Excellent,Thrilling And Gripping Superhero Film.
","Batman V Superman:Dawn Of Justice is an excellent,thrilling and gripping Superhero film that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,amazing Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Batman V Superman:Dawn Of Justice Batman,Superman,Superhero films and Comic Book films at their best.Set 18 months after the events in Man Of Steel,Batman V Superman tells the story of Batman/Bruce Wayne(Ben Affleck)who is angry about the destruction of Wayne enterprises and lives that were lost and blames Superman(Henry Cavill)for it. Now,Batman wants to destroy Superman at all costs.Batman V Superman:Dawn Of Justice is a terrific and very entertaining Superhero movie that after many solo feature films we finally saw two of the most iconic and famous Superhero in Comic Books and Pop Culture in Batman and Superman in a once in a lifetime showdown between the two famous figures. This is a movie that has been sharply and very harshly panned by critics and has And I'll admit while the movie is far from perfect and will not be for everyone this film in my opinion is one of the best films with both Batman and Superman and if you are a fan of either one of the characters or both you will enjoy this film. Batman V Superman is an amazing film where it shows the two worlds of Batman and Superman colliding on an big scale that grabs you from start to finish giving viewers a dark comic Book movie,an Action movie and character study for 153 minutes. What director Zack Snyder has done with the the film is incredible because It's an epic movie in story and scope giving us basically a Man Of Steel sequel,a Batman movie and a set up for a Justice League movie all in one continuing the story line from Man Of Steel while giving us something new and introducing another famous and iconic Superhero and Comic Book character in their first feature appearance. We get everything in this movie the Batman signal,Superman flying,fight scenes,Action and other things In BvS there is never a dull moment throughout with Action and Drama happening and never stopping until the very end. This movie while about Batman facing off against Superman is also about the two dealing with themselves and what they do in a complex and psychological way. With Batman/Bruce Wayne we see a man who is still haunted by the death of his parents and the destruction of Wayne enterprises and the people inside of the building and having nightmares(which are used in the film very effectively)and trying to get back at Superman at all costs. With Superman/Clark Kent we see him dealing with the idea of being seen as a hero or a villain to the people as well as himself while trying to find out who he is. The film explores the gray area of what is a hero and what is not a hero in a fascinating way. When the two finally face off and fight it's easily one of the best if not the best moment in the whole movie and will have you cheering at the screen. The Action and fight scenes are dazzling and stunning whether it's the Batman V superman fight or other Action scenes which keep you glued to the screen. The ending of Batman V Superman:Dawn Of Justice is outstanding with tons of Action,thrills and surprises that is fitting for the movie. A solid conclusion.The cast is great. Ben Affleck is excellent as Batman/Bruce Wayne,with Affleck being gritty,tough and intense. Henry Cavill is brilliant once again as Superman/Clark Kent,with Cavill bringing depth and power to the role. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful once again as Lois Lane,Superman's love interest. Jesse Eisenberg is delightful as Lex Luthor,the evil villain. Gal Gadot is great and sexy as Dians Prince,a mysterious woman. Diane Lane(Martha Kent),Laurence Fishburne(Perry White),Jeremy Irons(Alfred)and Holly Hunter(Senator Finch)give good performances as well.The direction by Zack Snyder is fantastic,with Snyder bringing and effective and gritty atmosphere to the film. Amazing direction,Snyder.The score by Hans Zimmer is outstanding,intense and moody,going nicely with the tone of the movie. Great score,Zimmer.In final word,if you love Batman,Superman,Comic Book films or Superhero films,I highly suggest you see Batman V Superman:Dawn Of Justice,an excellent,thrilling and gripping Superhero film that is worth your time. 9.5/10.",10,2,5,1 April 2016
Tombstone," An Excellent,Action-Packed Western Classic And One Of The Greatest Westerns Of All Time With Brilliant Performances From Kurt Russell And Val Klimer.
","Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time.Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs.In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone.The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey).The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos.The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton.In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,1,2 July 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," An Excellent,Scary,Imaginative,Original and Haunting Horror Classic. Wes Craven's Greatest film.
","A Nightmare On Elm Street is simply one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,scary,frightening and original Horror Classic that is filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy and memorable score and amazing Special Effects. It's one of my all-time favorite Horror films and is Wes Craven greatest film.Set in Springwood,Ohio,A Nightmare On Elm Street tells the story about a group of teenagers who live in the same neighborhood of Elm Street who have been having the same nightmares about a burnt and scarred man with finger knifes named Fred Krueger(Robert England). When one of the teens is killed in their sleep,Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp)has to figure out why Fred Krueger is stalking her and her friends in their nightmares and stop him before it's too late or Nancy won't wake up at all.There are many reasons A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic and my opinion a landmark Horror film. By 1984 everyone and their Mama was making a Slasher film and the Slasher genre during the period from 1978 to 1984 had hit it's peak,the Friday the 13th series by that time was in it's forth installment,the Halloween series was in limbo and semi-retirement(then brought back four years later)and the genre needed something fresh and exciting and ANOES was the answer. ANOES brilliantly combines the bloody,gory kills of the Slasher genre and mixes it with Fantasy and dreams. One of the reasons ANOES is so frightening and scary is because it blurs the lines of dreams and reality. Wes Craven pulls the viewer into a world where you're not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it a dream or a nightmare or are the characters in the film going crazy and imagining things. The film is a dark and scary experience where you feel like none of the characters are safe when they're awake or asleep and film's atmosphere adds to the characters since of dread and fear whether it's the darkness and shadows at or even in the beautiful daylight,with images and scenes that are disturbing and creative and will give viewers nightmares themselves. The kills,gore and special effects are scary and brilliant and is impressive for a film made on a low budget of 1 million dollars. The gore and special effects enhance the film and matches the film's nightmarish tone. Unlike most of the Slasher films during the 80s where the characters are not developed and unlikable and waiting to get killed,the characters in ANOES are likable and well-developed and you feel sympathy for them whether it's the teenagers or their parents. The teenagers in the film aren't like the unsuspecting teens in the Friday The 13th films,but sympathetic to the point where you feel sorry for them and what the characters have to deal with whether it's dealing with Fred Krueger or dealing with their parents. Before he was Freddy Krueger,popping off one-liners and becoming a Horror/Cult icon,Freddy Krueger was Fred Krueger in this film,a sick,twisted killer that killed you in your dreams and did it with a dark glee and joy. Unlike the other slasher icons like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers,Freddy had a personality and style and was unique. Instead of just using a machete or knife,Freddy uses his finger knifes and fear in this film,I also love the fact that Freddy doesn't get much screen time in the film always hiding in the darkness and shadows and not saying much dialog. What also makes Freddy a great character is that in the nightmares Freddy can control anything and have all the power to do what he wants to his prey and the victims are powerless and can't stop Freddy. While I love the Freddy character in the sequels,the version and character in this one is the scariest and most frightening. This film and the Freddy character in this film do for sleeping what Jaws did for swimming in the water and what Psycho did for taking showers and one of the reasons ANOES is such a timeless classic. The ending of the film like the rest of the movie is scary and ambiguous because you are not going to be sure if the ending is real or a dream. The ending is one of the things that adds to the film's greatness and will stay with you after you watch the movie. The whole cast is great in their roles. Heather Langenkamp does a great job as Nancy,the hero of the film,bringing depth,sympathy and a likable presence to the role. Robert England is simply amazing as Fred Krueger,bringing a menacing,scary and frightening believability to the role. England's performance in this film and the sequels made Freddy one of greatest movie villains of all time. John Saxon is wonderful as LT.Donald Thompson,a cop who is Nancy's father,Saxon is calm and collective in his performance. Ronee Blakley is effective and sad as Marge Thompson,Nancy's alcoholic mother. Johnny Depp does a great job as Glen,Nancy's boyfriend. Who would've known Depp would become one of the biggest stars on the planet. Amanda Wyss is wonderful in her small role as Tina,Nancy's best friend. Nick Corri does an outstanding job as Rod,Tina's bad boy boyfriend.Wes Craven's direction in the film is fantastic,giving the film and sense of fear and dread,moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and the scares are well done. Great job,Craven.Charles Bernstein's score and NOES theme is dark,frightening and effective and matches the film's scary feel. Creepy score by Bernstein.The Special Make-up effects by David B. Miller are amazing,gory and realistic and add to the film. Great effects,MillerIn final word,if you love Horror films,Slasher films or Wes Craven,I highly suggest you check out A Nightmare On Elm Street,a landmark and timeless Horror classic that will make you afraid to go to sleep and will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,2,13 December 2012
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," An Excellent And Hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy Cult Classic.
","Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is an excellent(no pun intended),hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,great laughs,a fine script,a memorable score and soundtrack and amazing special effects. All of those elements make Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure one of the most entertaining Comedies of the 1980s and a Cult Classic.Set in San Dimas,California,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure tells the story of teenage best friends Bill S. Preston Esquire(Alex Winter)and Ted Theodore Logan(Keanu Reeves)who are failing history class and are in danger of being separated forever. But when a man named Rufus(George Carlin)shows up in a phone booth time machine that can help them with their history project that can save their grade and friendship.Released in 1989,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a brilliant and hilarious movie that was a surprise hit at the Box Office grossing 40 million dollars above it's 10 million dollar budget and becoming a Cult Classic while introducing movie audiences to one of the coolest movie duos of all-time in Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan AKA Bill and Ted. From start to finish Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a movie that is an absolute blast that gives viewers plenty of laughs,Adventure and fun that just never stops and keeps viewers glued to the screen and is a movie in my opinion that ranks alongside the Back To The Future trilogy as one of the most entertaining time travel films of all-time. Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of those movies that(along with it's underrated sequel Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey)remains re-watchable to this very day and for 90 minutes is most triumphant and never takes itself too seriously because it's not going to be thought-provoking nor will it make you think but it's a film you will never forget. It's one of those films that takes you back to the 1980s and tells viewers to turn off your brain sit back and have fun with this movie. The Comedy and laughs in Excellent Adventure are fantastic with over the top moments that are smart and outlandish and will have you roaring with laughter. The Humor not only comes from the scenes with Bill and Ted but with the historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln,Napoleon,Billy The Kid,Beethoven and Joan Of Ark deal with modern day and how they deal with the modern world and society(circa 1989). While it's historically inaccurate and very silly it goes with the offbeat style of the movie. The time traveling scenes in Excellent Adventure are dazzling and imaginative using a Telephone instead of a car or watch The Screenplay by Chris Matheson and Ed Soloman is funny and at times smart with dialog and scenes that are clever and over the top with great comedic timing. Bill and Ted are one of the classic duos that are just iconic from the moment you see them on screen with memorable lines that are quoted to this very day such as excellent,dude and others. It's obvious that Bill and Ted aren't the smartest guys in the world and they don't always better themselves(they want to form a band but can't play their instruments)the two always remain lovable despite their flaws and we root for them to succeed in trying to pass History. Bill and Ted are among my favorite movie characters of all-time and are legends that will live on forever. The ending of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is amazing,fun and filled with surprises and laughs that will put smiles on viewers faces. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are excellent and hilarious as Bill and Ted,with Winter and Reeves bringing laughs and chemistry. George Carlin is delightful as Rufus,a man sent to help Bill and Ted. Terry Camilleri is hilarious and memorable as Napoleon,the French soldier. Dan Shor(Billy The Kid),Tony Steedman(Socrates),Rod Loomis(Freud),Al Leong(Ghangus Kahn),Jane Wiedlin(of 80s group The Go-Go's,Joan Of Ark),Robert Barron(Abraham Lincoln),Clifford David(Beethoven),Hal Landon Jr(Captain Logan),Bernie Casey(Mr. Ryan),Amy Stoch(Missy/Mom)and J. Patrick McNamara(Mr. Preston give good performances as well.The direction by Stephen Herek is terrific,with Herek bringing an energy,pace and visual style to the film. Great direction,Herek.The score by David Newman is outstanding and memorable,with Newman's score matching the light tone of the film. Fantastic score,Newman. There is also a terrific Heavy Metal/Hard Rock soundtrack that adds to the film.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI films or both,I highly suggest you see Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure,an excellent and hilarious SCI-FI/Comedy that you will never forget.

Casino," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made And One Of The Greatest Gangster Films Ever Made. Another Scorsese Classic.
","Martin Scorsese's Casino is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest Gangster films ever made that's filled with brilliant direction,excellent acting and a great Rock N' Roll soundtrack making this film another Scorsese classic,one of his best films and one of my all time favorite films.Set in Las Vegas in the 1970s and 1980s and based on a true story,Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein(Robert De Niro),an expert gambler connected to Gangsters and because of his success he is asked by the Mob to run the Tangiers,one of the biggest Casinos in Las Vegas and help steal money for the Mob. While in Vegas he marries hooker and hustler Ginger(Sharon Stone)and receives help from friend and gangster Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci). But as time goes on Ace,Ginger and Nicky discovers that their successes will lead to violence,death and betrayal and know that no one stay's on top forever.Released in 1995,Casino surprising received a mixed reception among critics and one of the criticisms of Casino is that the film was too similar to Scorsese's earlier Gangster film Goodfellas. But,thanks to showings on Cable TV,Home Video and DVD sales Casino has now been regarded as as a classic and one of Scorsese's best films and it's rightfully deserved. If Goodfellas was about the rise and fall of a New York Gangster then Casino is about the rise and fall of a empire. With Casino,Scorsese gives viewers a big and violent epic gangster film and shows viewers a different side of Las Vegas that most people probably already knew about but not many have seen where the city of LV is being secretly controlled by the Mob and where money and violence rule the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas. Casino is in many ways a tragic film where the characters in the film have success and money but there are many things that happen in the film mess up their own empire and value because when you listen to most of the narration in the film you feel like the characters are looking back at their past with regret and wishing they would have done something different. The rise and fall in this film is almost like a Shakespere play. One of the things that I always loved about Casino is the cinematography because Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson gives the film a beautiful and stylish look where the colors of the suits and production design just come off the screen and hit you in the eye. Scorsese cleverly tricks viewers with the beauty of the film and almost makes viewers forget about the violence and death that is in the air. The photography is one of the things that is different from Goodfellas because where Goodfellas seem more gritty and dirty,Casino is almost like Goodfellas glamorous and flamboyant little brother in comparison. The three main characters Ace,Ginger and Nicky,like in most of Scorsese films aren't always the most likable but have levels of depth and dimension that each characters shows throughout the film when things are happening around them whether it's buy their own doing with Aces' pride and ego,Ginger's troubled past and present,Nicky's violence or by someone else. You don't always like the main characters,but you don't hate them either. Although Casino is nearly three hours long the film moves at a quick pace and there isn't a wasted scene in the film. It's one of fastest near three hours you will ever watch. The violence in the film is bloody and deadly and Scorsese does not compromise or tone it down one bit showing what it's like when you're in the crime world. The violence in the film is so disgusting that you will never want to gamble or go to Las Vegas. Casino did for gambling and going to Las Vegas what Jaws did for swimming in the water. The ending of the film is great because it is a combination of violence,brutality and sadness which pretty much hangs over the course of the film and it is a classic Scorsese ending.The whole cast does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein,with De Niro bringing depth and intensity to the performance. Sharon Stone earned an Oscar nod for her powerful,sexy and fiery performance as Ginger,a hooker Ace falls for. Stone has great scenes with both De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant,funny and volatile as Nicky Santoro,with Pesci stealing every scene he's in. James Woods is great in his role as Ginger's pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Frank Marino,Nicky's right hand man. Pasguale Cajano is fantastic as Remi Gaggi,a top Mob boss. Alan King is great and memorable as Andy Stone,a head of the Teamsters. Kevin Pollock is Wonderful and smooth as Phillip Green. Don Rickles(Billy Sherbert),L.Q Jonesz(Pat Webb),John Bloom(Don Ward),Dick Smothers(Senator),Vinny Vella(Artie Piscano)and Phillip Suriano(Dominick Santoro)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant and masterful,with Scorsese giving a big,epic feel to the film with powerful atmosphere and is always moving the camera and using great angles. Great direction by Scorsese.The film has an amazing soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Can you Hear Me Knocking,Heart Of Stone,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,Sweet Virginia.),Devo(Whip It,(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction(Devo cover),The Moody Blues(Nights In White Satin),The Animals(House Of The Rising Sun),Fleetwood Mac(You Can Go Your Own Way),Rod Stewart(I Ain't Superstitious),B.B King(The Thrill Is Gone),Brenda Lee(I'M Sorry),Little Richard(Slippin' and Slidin'),Cream(Toad,Those Were The Days),Dean Martin(You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You) and more great songs. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci or Sharon Stone,I highly suggest you see Casino an unforgettable and powerful Gangster and film classic that you can watch again and again.

When Neil and his crew continue to rob and steal,Vincent is determined to take down Neil and his crew at all costs.Heat is a brilliant,unforgettable,epic Masterpiece that saw the paring of two amazing actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro going head to head and although the two co-starred in The Godfather Part II(1974),Pacino and De Niro never appeared on screen together. From beginning to end Heat is an unforgettable Masterwork that gives viewers a film of cinematic power a movie that is a mixture of Crime Drama,Action movie and character study giving viewers a film that is unique and fresh making Heat one of the greatest Crime Dramas of all time but also the greatest Cops and Robbers film ever made. Heat is a movie that keeps you glued to the screen and is a film that is intense and thrilling,dark and gritty and at the same time vibrant and powerful with a tight grip that never lets go until the end. Heat is an epic film in the truest sense of the word not only in length(170 minutes)but the way it is shown with lots of characters and great storytelling and while the film is long you are Like most Michael Mann's films Heat is a movie that combines great style and substance the style is in the film looks thanks to Dante Spinotti's visually stunning photography using the colors blue and gray that gives the film a stylish look almost like a stylish but realistic Film Noir where the characters are surrounded by a darkness. The city of Los Angeles also plays a huge part Heat's style and look because the way that L.A. looks in this film because while there is still bright lights and great sunlight in the background it's very atmospheric and gritty not just at night but also in the daytime too. Mann loves filming in Los Angeles and it shows with this movie. The substance in Heat is the way Director Michael Mann approaches the Cops and Robbers movie and the main characters because what makes Heat rise above other Cops and Robbers movies that Mann not only focuses on Vincent and Neil professional lives but also their personal lives and the personal lives of most of the characters around them which makes Heat a unique film in it's own right. Vincent and Neil are two amazing characters and are two of the best characters Michael Mann have ever created because while the two characters are on the opposite sides of the law(cop and thief),Vincent and Neil are mirrors of each other in the way they do their jobs and are obsessive with what they do. Vincent and Neil are also characters with great depth and complexity and when you look into their personal lives you will relate to the two and realize are multi-dimensional characters. Vincent and Neil are two characters you will never forget The screenplay by Michael Mann is brilliant and memorable with dialog that is tough and gritty while at the same time intelligent and powerful with characters that are unforgettable. The prime example of Mann's great writing is the classic,famous and iconic restaurant scene between Vincent and Neil. The Heist and robbery scenes are fantastic and done with great detail and realism that you would probably see in a real life robbery. The Action scenes in Heat are great and thrilling and the most exciting Action scene in Heat is the big shootout that happens which is one of the best Action scenes in movie history because it's so intense and powerful and done with great realism and will just blow your mind. The ending of Heat is one of the greatest endings in film history because while the ending is simple it is just so amazing,effective and done with so much emotion and depth. The ending is amazing and unforgettable and is one of the things that makes Heat a Masterpiece.The whole cast is terrific. Al Pacino is excellent and at his best as Lt. Vincent Hanna,with Pacino bringing emotion,depth and intensity to role. Robert De Niro is brilliant and at his best as Neil McCauley,with De Niro bringing power,grit and emotion to the role. Val Kilmer is fantastic as Chris,the right hand man on Neil's crew. Jon Voight is wonderful as Nate,a man that gives Neil information. Tom Sizemore is great as Michael,a member of Neil's crew. Diane Venora(Justine Hanna),Amy Brennemann(Eddy)and Ashley Judd(Charlene)do wonderful jobs as the main female characters. Mykelti Williamson(Sgt. Drucker),Wes Studi(Detective Casals),Ted Levine(Bosko),Dennis Haybert(Donald),William Fichtner(Roger Van Zant),Natalie Portman(Lauren),Tom Noonan(Kelso),Kevin Gage(Waingro),Hank Azaria(Alan),Danny Trejo(Trejo),Henry Rollins(Hugh),Jeremy Piven(Dr. Bob),Bud Cort(Cook),Ricky Harris(Albert Torena)and Tone Loc(Richard Torena)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Mann is brilliant and stylish,with Mann always moving the camera and giving the film a great visual style while also doing a great job with the Action scenes and Heist/Robbery scenes. Wonderful direction,Mann.The score by Elliot Goldenthal is fantastic,powerful and intense and fits with film's tone. I also loved Goldenthal's version of Moby's song God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters which is perfect for the final scene. Great score,Goldenthal.In final word,if you love Michael Mann,Al Pacino,Robert De Niro,Crime Dramas,Action films or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Heat,an excellent,unforgettable epic Masterpiece that is Michael Mann,Al Pacino,Robert De Niro at their best.",10,0,3,3 November 2013
Pineapple Express," A Brilliant,Hilarious,Over The Top Action-Comedy. An Instant Stoner Film Classic FromThe Judd Apatow Gang.
","Pineapple Express is an brilliant,hilarious Comedy that masterfully mixes laughs,Action and stoner Comedy. Filled with amazing direction,a great cast,intense,over the top Action and a memorable script,Pineapple Express is instant classic stoner Comedy and the Judd Apatow gang at their best.Pineapple Express tells the story Dale Denton(Seth Rogan),a process server who loves his job and loves to smoke marijuana. While he's out on the job,Dale accidentally witnesses a gang related murder and with no one to turn to,Dale goes to his drug dealer Saul Silver(James Franco)and the two decide to run. Now on the run,Dale and Saul have to outrun and outsmart murderous criminals,corrupt cops and dangerous hit-man and also smoke some marijuana and laughs and chaos ensues.What do you get when you combine Comedy,Action,a buddy movie and a Stoner film? You get the hilarious and excellent Action-Comedy stoner film Pineapple Express one of the smartest and funniest stoner films of all time that is my second favorite Judd Apatow film right behind Superbad and Pineapple Express is a funny and wonderful companion piece to Superbad. Why is Pineapple Express such a great movie is because director David Gordan Green,producer Judd Apatow and co-writer Seth Rogan have taken the stoner film genre and raised it to another level giving viewers a film that is funny and thrilling mixing great laughs and wonderful Action that is done in a surrealistic way to the point of going completely over the top. The Comedy and laughs in the film come right from the first frame and the laughs never stop until the very and the Humor isn't just based on the main characters getting high but the crazy and bizarre situations that happen throughout and viewers are not sure if the characters Dale and Saul are imagining all this or is it really happening. This film is a crazy Adventure in the highest(no pun intended)and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I don't think I have ever seen a stoner Comedy mixed with an Action film before and the way that the two genres meet and come together is fresh and original mixing funny drug induced insanity with gunfights,car chases,fights and explosions. It is as if Cheech and Chong met up with Joel Silver or Jerry Bruckheimer and decided to make an Action-Comedy. Is PE the start of a new sub genre of Stoner Action-Comedy? If it is then the roots of the sub genre started here start here. PE is also a great and fun Buddy movie because like any great buddy movie you see two great characters who can not only relate to each other but relate to the audience as well and the two great buddies in the film are Dale and Saul. Dale and Saul are great characters and a classic duo because while they are on their adventure they not only try to survive the criminals but get to know each other while they're on the run and the relationship and banter between the two is hilarious and real. What also makes them great characters is their ambitions:Dale wants to be a Radio Talk show host while Saul wants to design and build buildings. Never in a film about getting high have two stoner's been so ambitious. The screenplay by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg is fantastic,great,hilarious and truly memorable,with Rogan and Goldberg giving the main characters amazing well-written and quotable dialog which is smarter than most films about getting stoned. At 112 minutes PE moves at a great pace and fantastic energy and the film goes by fast you will not know what in the heck happened. The Action scenes in the film are wonderful with lots of great gunfights and fistfights and combing them with Comedy makes the Action scenes much more wild and chaotic. The ending or final 20-30 minutes of PE is Action-filled and have tons of laughs throughout and the ending is something you will never forget and add to PE's greatness and brilliance.The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Seth Rogan is brilliant and funny as Dale,with Rogan bringing great laughs and dialog. James Franco is excellent and hilarious as Saul,with Franco being very believable in his performance and having amazing chemistry with Rogan. Danny McBride is amazing and is a funny scene stealer as Red,Saul's friend and fellow drug dealer. Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson are funny and memorable as Budlofsky and Matheson,two killers chasing Dale and Saul. Gary Cole is great as Ted Jones,a gangster and drug lord. Rosie Perez is truly wonderful as Carol,a corrupt cop who is also Ted's lover. Amber Heard is funny and beautiful as Angie,Dale's high school girlfriend. Ed Begley Jr.(Robert)and Nora Dunn(Shannon)are funny and over the top as Angie's parents. Bill Hader(Private Miller),James Remar(General Bratt),Cleo King(Police Liaision Officer) and Joe Lo Truglio(Mr. Edwards)give funny performances as well.The direction by David Gordon Green is wonderful,with Green always moving the camera,with close-ups,angles and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction,Green.The score by Graeme Revell is great,light,effective and matches the tone of the film. A good,memorable score by Revell. The film's soundtrack also has great songs from Huey Lewis& The News(Pineapple Express Theme song),Public Ememy(Lost At Birth),Bel Biv DeVoe(Poison),Bob Marley(Time Will Tell),Robert Palmer(Woke Up Laughing),Eddy Grant(Electric Avenue),Peter Toss(Wanted Dread or Alive),Cypress Hill(Dr. Greenthumb),Brother Noland(Coconut Girl)and more. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Judd Apatow,Comedies,Action films or Stoner films,you will love Pineapple Express,an hilarious,Action-packed Stoner Comedy that you won't forget and is the Judd Apatow gang at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,2,5,18 June 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," An Excellent,Unforgettable And Funny Comedy-Drama From The Coen Brothers
","Inside Llewyn Davis is an excellent,unforgettable and funny Comedy-Drama that combines wonderful direction,a great cast,a fantastic script and a terrific soundtrack and with all of those element Inside Llewyn Davis is not only a great film but also The Coen Brothers at their best.Set in the New York section of Greenwich Village in 1961,Inside Llewyn Davis tells the story of Llewyn Davis(Oscar Isaac),a Folk singer who is trying be a successful music artist while dealing with his own personal life taking him on an interesting journey of discovery about himself.Inside Llewyn Davis is another amazing film from one of my favorite directors master filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen AKA The Coen Brothers. The Coens have been on a roll delivering great film after great film the first film being their excellent Oscar winning Masterpiece No Country For Old Men(2007),their wonderful and very underrated Black Comedies Burn After Reading(2008)and A Serious Man(2009),the terrific Western remake True Grit(2010)and now Inside Llewyn Davis,an outstanding Comedy-Drama that is funny,intimate and The Coen Brothers delivering another incredible film to their body of work. Right from the beginning Inside Llewyn Davis is a sensational film that gives us a brilliant and at times quirky character study set in and around the Folk music scene in Greenwich Village New York with a movie that is simple but is still very engrossing and unforgettable because when you watch the film you are on the journey along with the main character. The Comedy and Humor in Inside Llewyn Davis is funny and weird and done in the style that is very much like the Coen Brothers using the characters and interactions with each to drive the Humor which is subtle and interesting. Although the movie is funny the Comedy has much more in common with A Serious Man then say Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski. Another thing that I love about The Coen Brothers films and this movie as well is the amazing photography and attention to detail. The photography by Bruno Delbonnel is beautiful and visually stunning making the cold snow and winter look very bleak and isolating and at times surreal with harsh lighting that is dark and light. Also,The Coen Brothers' attention to detail and production design by Jess Goncher give the film a realistic look and truly takes you back to the year of 1961 whether it's in a bar,on the road or in a music studio you will feel like you are in the Folk music scene of 1961. The music scenes in ILD are exceptional and gives the film not only a great energy and tone but an accurate depiction of what the Folk music scene was like in the early 1960s and the performances by the actors feel true(it helps that actor Oscar Issac is a guitar player and singer in real life). You can now add Llewyn Davis to the gallery of great and memorable characters from The Coen Brothers films because like most of the other Coen Brothers characters Lleywn is a character looking to find himself in his surroundings and trying to figure out where to go whether it's dealing with trying to be a successful Folk musician or his personal life that at times can be funny and dramatic. And while Llewyn isn't always the most likable character has a depth that makes us relate to him because we are along with Llewyn on the journey he goes on. Llewyn Davis is a great Coen Brothers character that anchors the film and is a character you will never forget. The screenplay by The Coens is wonderful and memorable filled with great dialog mixing Comedy and Drama the only way The Coens can do. The ending of Inside Llewyn Davis is truly amazing because it makes ask questions about what happened throughout the film while leaving you with laughs,wonder and mystery. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Oscar Isaac is excellent and memorable as Llewyn Davis,with Isaac bringing emotion and depth to the role. Carey Mulligan is terrific as Jean,Llewyn's ex-girlfriend. Justim Timberlake does a fine job in his small role as Jim,Jean's boyfriend. Coen Brothers regular John Goodman is wonderful as Roland Turner,a Jazz Musician. Garrett Hedlund is great as Johnny Five,a beat poet. F. Murray Abraham is great as Bud Grossman,a guy in the music business. Ethan Phillips(Mitch Gorfein),Robin Bartlett(Lillian Gorfein),Stark Sands(Troy Nelson),Adam Driver(Al Cody)and Max Casella(Pappi)give good performances as well.The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and stylish,with The Coen Brothers always moving the camera and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Wonderful direction by The Coens.The soundtrack in Inside Llewyn Davis is fantastic with mostly Folk songs by Oscar Isaac and more. An outstanding soundtrack.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers or Folk Music,I highly suggest you see Inside Llewyn Davis,an excellent,unforgettable and funny Comedy-Drama that is The Coen Brothers at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,3,7 February 2014
Sin City," A Brilliant,Ultra-Violent Visually Stunning Comic Book Classic.
","Frank Miller's Sin City is one of the greatest comic book films of all time thanks to it's great direction,unforgettable characters,excellent cast,beautiful black and white visual style,great Hard-Boiled dialog and tough Film-Noir landscape. This film is one of my favorite movies of all-time,Robert Rodriguez's best film and not only a comic book classic,but a film classic in my opinion.Based on Frank Miller's Graphic Novels of the same name and set in a timeless Black and White Film-Noir landscape,Sin City tells three violent,Hard-Boiled stories that shows us the world of Sin City involving Marv(Mickey Rourke),a brute trying to avenge the death of his one true love,a prostitute named Goldie(Jamie King)by any means necessary in The Hard Goodbye,smooth talking killer Dwight(Clive Owen)who wants to protect a gang of hookers from corrupt cop Jackie Boy(Benicio Del Toro)in The Big Fat Kill and Hartigan(Bruce Willis)an honest cop who wants to protect exotic dancer Nancy(Jessica Alba)from a Yellow Bastard rapist named Roarke Jr. Nick Stahl)in That Yellow Bastard.There is many reasons I love Sin City and the reasons are the characters,Film-Noir dialog,Action,faithfulness to the Graphic Novels,timeless feel and visual style. True to the spirit of Film-Noir the male and female characters in the film,whether it's hardened criminals,corrupt cops,corrupt politicians,hookers or honest cops are very dark and cynical,existing in a violent world where the rules don't apply,everyone is dangerous and violence and brutality are the only way out. The three main characters(Marv,Dwight,Hartigan)are likable and you can relate in to each of them in their own way because of their motivations and reasons to why they do the things they do and you as the viewer are with Marv,Dwight and Hartigan as they go through their journey. The dialog by Frank Miller is masterful and unforgettable and said in a fast pace,quickness and wit,with Miller taking the Hard-Boiled style of Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler and taking it to new heights,where the characters speak in a style that is sometimes riddled with dark humor,one-liners and aggressive style. Each story(The Hard Goodbye,The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard)is terrific and unforgettable with each tale being different but just alike in tone,energy and execution that never stops until the very end. The narration is a classic Film-Noir trademark and this film embraces it,with the main characters speaking with a low-pitched,dark tone almost like the main characters are whispering in your ear almost as if you're with the characters in the film. The Action and violence in the film is well-done,brutal,bloody and over the top and fits with the style of the film and will have fans of the books foaming at the mouth. The movie's violence is stylish and over the top to the point where you are almost laughing,but be warned this film is not for the faint at heart or people with weak stomachs. What I also love about Sin City is how timeless it is,taking styles,costumes and talk from any decade and you're not sure of what time period the film takes place in. Is it the future or the past or somewhere in between time. The great thing is we'll never know. Robert Rodriguez obviously loved the material and stays true to the graphic novels with not just the dialog,but the Black and White visual style of the film. The tone,photography and visual style is beautiful,just like in the books,giving us a world where there is no sunlight and it's cloudy and rainy all the time where it is always night. The only brief time you see other colors is in red or yellow(you'll see). This movie is also one of the most faithful comic book movies I've ever seen because,like I said before Rodriguez loved the material and doesn't change anything for the film whether it's the violence,Action or dialog. You can hold the graphic novels next to the film and you won't see much of a difference between them. This movie took the words faithful and true to another level and I loved that Rodriguez stays faithful and true to the books and doesn't compromise the film and that's one of the things that makes Sin City a classic. The ending of Sin City is amazing and powerful because it's not only true to the Graphic Novels but to the genre Film-Noir with harsh violence,brutality and a tragic outcome. A terrific ending.The whole cast does a great job. Mickey Rourke is excellent and at his best as Marv,my favorite character in my favorite story(The Hard Goodbye)in the film,with Rourke bringing toughness and grit to the role. Clive Owen is terrific as Dwight,a killer who loves to help the ladies. Bruce Willis is brilliant as Hartigan,an honest cop with a moral code. Willis and Film-Noir go together well. Benicio Del Toro is delightful as corrupt cop Jackie Boy. Elijah Wood is scary as silent cannibal killer Kevin. Nick Stahl is frightening and menacing as Rourke Jr.,That Yellow Bastard. Jessica Alba is wonderful and sexy as Nancy,a girl Hartigan has to protect. Rosario Dawson is beautiful and tough as Gail,the leader of gun toting hookers. Jamie King is good as twins Goldie and Wendy. Brittney Murphy(Sheille),Michael Clarke Duncan(Manute),Carla Gugino(Lucille),Rutger Hauer(Cardinal Roark),Powers Boothe(Senator Roark),Alexis Bledel(Becky),Michael Madsen(Bob),Devon Aoki(Miho),Tommy Flanagan(Brian)Nicky Katt(Stuka),Josh Hartnett(The Man)and Marley Shelton(The Customer)give good performances as well.The Direction by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is excellent,bringing a lot of energy and style to the film using great camera angles and moving the film at a wonderful pace. Great direction by both men. Also,Quentin Tarantino makes a special guest director appearance for the film.The score by Robert Rodriguez,Graeme Revell and John Debney is great,stylish and full with energy and fits in with the tone of this film. Great score.In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Frank Miller,comic books,Film-Noir or the Sin City Graphic Novels,I suggest you see Sin City,an absolute classic of comic films and cinema and is a movie you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,3,5,17 January 2013
True Romance," An Excellent And Powerful Classic With An Amazing Cast. Tony Scott(RIP)And Quentin Tarantino At Their Best.
","True Romance is an excellent and powerful classic that mixes Action,Romance and Crime Drama. Filled with great direction,a masterful screenplay by Quentin Tarantino,an amazing cast and a wonderful soundtrack,True Romance is Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino at their best.True Romance tells the story of Clarence Worley(Christian Slater),a comic book store clerk who while out celebrating his birthday meets up with a hooker named Alabama(Patricia Arquette). After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence.Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott,written by Quentin Tarantino and receiving rave reviews from critics was a Box Office failure and ignored by audiences. But thanks to the worldwide critical and Box Office success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers a truly amazing and unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is truly a Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are often associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each main character who's in the film for a long or short period of time will stay with viewers because Tarantino's script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino has said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film.The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well.The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott.The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer.In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,4,5,9 July 2013
The Breakfast Club," The Greatest Teen Film Of All Time And John Hughes' (RIP)Greatest Film. A Landmark Classic.
","The Breakfast Club is the greatest Teen film of all time and is not only a Teen classic of the 80s,but a film Classic for all times. With a great balance of Comedy,Drama,Great Direction,excellent performances and an well-written screenplay,The Breakfast Club is John Hughes' greatest film and is a landmark in Teen Films,High School Films and Coming Of Age films.Set on March 24,1984 in Shermer High School in Shermer,Illinois,The Breakfast Club tells the story of five High School students Brian Johnson,The Brain(Anthony Michael Hall),Andrew Clark,The Athlete(Emilio Estevez),Allison Reynolds,The Basketcase(Ally Sheedy),Claire Standish,The Princess(Molly Ringwald)and John Bender,The Criminal(Judd Nelson)who are from different social backgrounds and have to serve detention on a Saturday under the watchful eye of teacher Richard Vernon(Paul Gleason). While there in detention,the five students talk to each other and realize they have a lot in common beyond their stereotypes and social classes and the experience changes their lives forever making them known forever as...The Breakfast Club.What can be said about The Breakfast Club that hasn't been said already,it's a classic that revolutionized Teen films at the time and has a style and influence that has been imitated,but never duplicated. The reason,I think TBC works do well is because of the five teen characters and how we can relate to each of them in different ways discussing their fears,desires and problems with their parents. The Teenage years can be a funny,strange and confusing time for many people and Hughes puts it on full display with this film giving us three dimensional characters that are lifted beyond their stereotypes and showing true emotions and feelings and no matter what race,color or class you are you'll identify with each character. While the fashions and music are of the 80s,the feelings and emotions are truly timeless and heartfelt and one of the reasons TBC has stood the test of time. The screenplay by John Hughes(which Hughes wrote in 2 days)is excellent and well-written balancing Comedy and Drama and giving the characters memorable dialog,while they're laughs and funny moments,they're moments of great drama and truth in some of the scenes. Hughes was a true master of the teenage language and the dialog in TBC feels real and authentic almost like you're next to the characters hearing the dialog. I don't think that Hughes was trying reinvent or revolutionize the Teen genre,but unintentionally he did with this film and his other films as well bringing a depth and excellence that hadn't been seen in Teen films since Rebel Without A Cause and American Graffiti. The only 80s Teen films that can match TBC's honesty and truth is Hughes' other films and Fast Times At Ridgemont High. While Hughes' other films Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Sixteen Candles,Pretty In Pink,Some Kind Of Wonderful and Weird Science are also classics of the Teen film genre,TBC in my opinion will remain his most enduring and most powerful. What I also love about the film is the setting being in one location which is a High School library which is used to great effect and adds to the film. Making a Teen movie set in one location with no sex,nudity,parties or drinking(although the characters do use drugs in the film)seemed like a risky gamble at the time,but Hughes makes use of his one location and still keeps the film entertaining and interesting. The one location gives the film a feeling or style of stage play or an small independent film and Hughes in his own way made a film like 12 Angry Men or Glengarry Glen Ross,where instead of 12 jurors and real estate office workers,it's teenagers in High School. Despite the film being set in one location Hughes keeps the film moving at a quick pace and a lot of energy and as a viewer you are glued to the screen. The ending of the film is a great ending and makes the viewers asks a lot of questions and gives us no answers. It's a masterful ending that will make us the viewers put together the dots and answers and have us wondering what happened to the characters and is one of the reasons TBC is brilliant.The whole cast does a great job. Emilio Estevez is excellent as Andrew,the Wrestling jock who's pressured to succeed and win. Judd Nelson is brilliant in his career defining performance as John Bender,a rebel who is cynical,irritating,yet likable. Anthony Michael Hall is great as Brian,the smart kid who has to have high grades or will fail in life. Molly Ringwald is wonderful as Claire,the popular girl who is the target of Bender's irritation. Ally Sheedy is effective as Allison,the outcast who doesn't say much,but talks as times rolls on. Paul Gleason(RIP)is great as John Vernon,cynical teacher who hates the students at the school,especially Bender. John Kapelos does a fine and funny job as Carl The Janitor who offers words of wisdom to the kids and Vernon.The direction by John Hughes is simple,but great,with Hughes bringing a lot of energy to the film with his writing and direction. Great Job,John. Thank you John Hughes for giving viewers great Teen films that are timeless classics that will live on and be loved and cherished forever. RIP,John.Keith Forsey's score in the film is seldom used,but works and fits with film's tone. The film has a great soundtrack as well,especially with the film iconic theme song Don't You(Forget About Me)by Simple Minds and other great songs Fire In The Twilight(Wang Chung)and We Are Not Alone(Karla DeVito). Hughes' films always had great soundtracks and TBC is no exception.In final word,if you love John Hughes,Teen Films,High School Films,Coming Of Age films or films in general,I suggest you see The Breakfast Club,a true classic that will stand the test of time and will live forever in cinema and with audiences. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,1,2,8 January 2013

With the help of Dr. Brown Marty must find a way to get back to the year 1985.Released in 1985,Back To The Future is a brilliant and entertaining film that was without a doubt the biggest Box Office hit of 1985 grossing over 300 million dollars world wide and is just an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is one of those movies that is the definition of what a blockbuster should be and where everything from the direction,the cast and story work to absolute perfection with no false note or missing beat. I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen. Although there are some serious moments Back To The Future is lighthearted with non-stop fun From beginning to end,Back To The Future has an energy and flow that just never stops and keeps you glued to the screen with relentless pace and excitement that makes the film re-watchable and iconic to this very day. The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters. The SCI-FI scenes in BTTF involving the Delorean are so dazzling and are done with imagination and beauty that will make your jaw drop and it doesn't matter how many times you see BTTF you will be blown away by the Delorean sequences. There have been many classic movie duos throughout cinema and among the great duos are Marty and Doc. The scenes between Marty and Doc are truly funny with terrific back and forth banter and have some of the best scenes in the film that are unforgettable. While the two are different in personality and are separated by age the two have a friendship that feels genuine and real where you feel that Marty and Doc would have each other's back at all costs. The friendship between Marty and Doc is further cemented in Part II and III where you feel they will be friends forever whether it's in the future or in the present. Marty and Doc are two amazing and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. The ending of Back To The Future is terrific,thrilling and filled with surprises that will leave viewers laughing and smiling. A fantastic ending.The cast is wonderful. Michael J. Fox is excellent and funny as Marty McFly,with Fox bringing laughs and charisma to the role. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as Dr. Emmett Doc Brown,with Lloyd being delightfully over the top and having a fantastic chemistry with Fox. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are wonderful as Lorraine and George McFly,Marty's parents. Thomas F. Wilson is terrific and fun as Biff,a neighborhood bully. James Toklin is great as Mr. Strickland,a hard nosed principal. Claudia Wells(Jennifer),Mark McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Sperber(Linda McFly),Jeffrey Jay Cohan(Skinhead),Casey Siemaszko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),George DiCenzo(Sam Baines),Francis Lee McCain(Stella Baines),Harry Waters Jr.(Marvin Berry),Donald Fullilove(Goldie Wilson),Will Hare(Pa Peabody)and Norman Alden(Lou)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is amazing,with Zemeckis always moving the camera while giving the film with great camera angles,pace and atmosphere.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding and one of best scores in movie history,with Silvestri's score being epic,suspenseful and uplifting. Incredible score,Silvestri.

Great effects,ILM.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI,Robert Zemeckis or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again.

Goodfellas," An Excellent,Flawless Masterpiece And Classic From Martin Scorsese And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made.
","Goodfellas is an excellent,flawless Masterpiece and a Classic and it's not only one of the greatest Gangster Films ever made and one of the greatest films of the 90's but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with masterful direction,excellent performances and a great soundtrack,Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films and is Martin Scorsese and cinema at it's best.Set in New York,based on the true life book Wiseguy by Nicolas Pileggi and based on a true story,Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)an Irish-Italian man who has had a love for Gangsters and gangster life since he was a teenager in his local neighborhood. As a youngster Henry starts working for the Mob and as a he gets older Henry becomes apart of the Mob and living the lifestyle of a gangster. Over the course of three decades Henry Hill along with his friends Jimmy The Gent Conway(Robert De Niro)and Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci)depicts Henry's easy rise in the Mob and his hard and dangerous downfall.Right from the opening credits and all the way to the very end Goodfellas is a flawless masterwork of a film that pulls you end and does not let go until the final frame. Martin Scorsese has created a film that right next to Francis Coppola's The Godfather as the definitive Gangster film. But where as The Godfather was an epic and somewhat romantic view of gangster like and a Mob family,Goodfellas took a much different direction and gives viewers a darker,less romantic view of Mob showing viewers a world of how a Mobster lives his life as a gangster. What is different about Goodfellas is that the story tells the story from the point of view of the gangsters who works is not a Mob Boss or someone who runs a crime family but someone who works under the Mob bosses. One of the things I love about the film Goodfellas is the way Scorsese plays with the audience showing things from Henry Hill's point of view where from Hill's point of view the Mob is a great way of living and a easy way to make money and live the good life showing the glamour,suits and cars making audiences love the lifestyle. But Scorsese tricks audiences and shows us that Gangster and Mob life can be a dangerous and violent way of living where you can either be killed or sent to prison. Scorsese gives the film a since of dread where there is violence in the air and that being in the Mob is not all it's cracked up to be. Some Films based on true stories while good are most of the time told in a straight forward fashion and if Goodfellas had been in the hands of another filmmaker it would have been more of a straight forward true story but Scorsese being the master filmmaker that he is fills the film with great scenes and moments that are iconic and memorable and Scorsese keeps you glued to the screen engrossed by the film and making you want more making Goodfellas one of the greatest true stories on film. The screenplay by Scorsese and Pileggi is impressive giving the film excellent dialog and scenes with great realism and edge making you as the viewer feel like you are in the scenes with the characters. Goodfellas is one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever go through because when the film starts it never slows down and let's you breath a sigh of relief. The pace is so rapid and quick you will feel like you are watching a 90 minute film rather than a two and a half hour one. I think it's because of the documentary and raw feel of the film and how we as the viewer are in the movie. Goodfellas is like a Rock N'Roll record put on film where you are looking and listening. The main characters in the film are not what you would call likable,but are well-developed and there is times when you can relate to them and you see things from their point of view and you get pulled into their state of minds. The ending and final 20-30 minutes is a classic ending filled with suspense and paranoia that is pushed to the max. It's an ending you will not forget.The cast does excellent jobs in their roles. Ray Liotta is amazing in his career defining role as Henry Hill,with Liotta bringing intensity and wild energy to the role. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Jimmy Conway,with De Niro being menacing and unforgettable. Joe Pesci is brilliant in his Oscar winning role as the volatile Tommy DeVito,with Pesci being scary,intense and funny at the same time. Lorraine Bracco is riveting as Karen Hill,Henry's wife. Bracco has great chemistry with Liotta. Paul Sorvino is captivating and suave as Paulie,the boss over everybody. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Billy Batts,a made guy from Tommy's past. Frank Sivero(Frankie Carbone),Chuck Low(Morris),Michael Imperioli(Spider),Debi Mazer(Sandy),Gina Mastrogiacomo(Janice)and Catherine Scorsese(Tommy's Mother)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an early role by Samuel L. Jackson in the role of Stacks.The direction by Martin Scorsese is masterful and brilliant,with Scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style. Great direction by Scorsese.The soundtrack in the film is one of best soundtracks in movie history with classics by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Monkey Man),Donovan(Atlantis),The Crystels(Then He Kissed Me),Cream(Sunshine Of Your Love),The Who(Magic Bus),Harry Nilsson(Jump Into The Fire),Sid Vicious(My Way),Bobby Darin(Beyond The Sea),Aretha Franklin(Baby I Love you),Eric Clapton,Derek and The Dominoes(Layla,Piano Exit),George Harrison(What Is Life)and more. Excellent soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster films,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Goodfellas,a timeless Masterpiece and Classic that you can watch again and again and should be in every film lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,0,20 April 2013
Evil Dead II," One Of The Best Horror Films And Sequels Of All Time. A Classic Horror/Comedy.
","Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is one of the best Horror films and Sequels ever made that brilliantly mixes Horror,Comedy,great direction,an excellent performance from Bruce Campbell and great special effects. Those are the reasons Evil Dead II is one of my favorite Horror films,one of my favorite sequels and one of my favorite movies of all time and why Evil Dead II is a true Horror classic.Taking place right after the events in the first Evil Dead,our hero Ash(Bruce Campbell) is still at the cabin in the woods still trying to fight off the flesh possessing ghouls. Now with a group of strangers also in the cabin,Ash and the group must stay in the cabin and trying to fight and survive The Evil Dead or the demons will swallow their souls.Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is such an amazing and brilliant Horror film because while it still has the scary feel of the first film,ED II takes on a different direction by adding Comedy into the mix and gives viewers one of the most insane,crazy and over the top Horror films of all time. Mixing Horror and Comedy together is never easy,but director Sam Raimi manages to pull it off so flawlessly. Raimi fills up the film with funny and imaginative slapstick and mixing it with over the top gore,making us laugh and squirm at the same time. Raimi is obviously a huge fan of The Three Stooges(even calling the stunt men fake Shemps)and Raimi applies that same slapstick Comedy and hilarious suffering with this film,especially with the character Ash. The character Ash goes through such maniacal and hilarious torture from either the demons or himself that you'll wonder if he'll make it out alive or lose his mind and that's one of the great things about the film. Horror and Comedy are two sides of the same coin and Raimi knows this because Raimi balances out both Horror and Comedy by taking the most horrifying situations and making them funny and also taking the funny situations and making them horrible and it's done in a smart way. EDII is one of the few films that can wonderfully and greatly mixes hilarious Comedy and over the top gore and the only films that can match it are other Horror Comedy classics such as The Return Of The Living Dead,An American Werewolf In London,Re-Animator and Dead Alive just to name a few. EDII and those other great Horror films are apart of the great Horror sub genre called Splatstick(a mixture and combination of Comedy and gore). Even though there is a lot hilarious Comedy,Raimi still knows that EDII is at heart a Horror film and Raimi gives viewers a lot scary,intense and suspenseful moments,using the demon POV shots with great effect and crazy insane energy using loud sound effects and dark atmosphere and Raimi lets his imagination run wild. This movie is like the first Evil Dead on a bad acid trip and you're coming along for a crazy ride. The movie's violence and gory scenes,while toned down from the first film(most of the blood and gore is red,green and blue)is still great and intense and matches the violence of the first film. The main character Ash is a lot different from the first film,where in the first one he was scared and heroic but in this film he's tough and heroic and willing to face the demons head-on and spitting out great one-liners,even though he still shows fear and terror. Ash is one of my all-time favorite movie characters cause of this film. The ending is great cliffhanger ending and is a good set-up for the follow-up Army Of Darkness and will have viewers laughing. There's been debate over the years about whether or not EDII is a sequel or a remake of the first film. While a few scenes are a remake of the first film,the whole film is a sequel and has it's own creativity and originality like the first film and is a classic like the first one.The cast does a good job. Bruce Campbel gives a brilliant,hilarious performance as Ash,saying great one-liners,being tough,funny,taking out the demons with an iron fist. This performance made Ash a classic character of the Horror genre and made Bruce Campbell a B-movie icon,a Horror icon and a Genre movie icon. An excellent performance. Sarah Berry does a good job as Annie. Dan Hicks and Kassie Wesley give funny performances as rednecks Jake and Bobby Joe. Theodore Raimi(Sam's Brother)is funny and freaky as Possessed Henrietta. Richard Domeier does a good job as Ed,Annie's boyfriend. Denise Bixler(Linda),John Peakes(Professor Raymond Knowby)and Lou Hancock(Henrietta Knowby)give good performances as well.The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent,with Raimi bringing manic,crazy energy to the film with great angles,close-ups and the POV shots of the demons and Raimi also does well in the scary and funny scenes. Great direction,Raimi.The music score by Joseph Doluca is impressive and memorable and fits in with the insane,crazy energy of the film. Great score.The special effects by K.N.B FX group are excellent,well-done,gory and at times very realistic and work for the film.In final word,if you love Horror films,Cult films,Sam Raimi or Bruce Campbell,I suggest you see Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn,a Horror classic that will stand the test of time and stay with you forever. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,0,1,15 February 2013
The Godfather," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Brilliant,Powerful Unforgettable Masterpiece From Francis Ford Coppola.
","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10,6,10,30 March 2014
