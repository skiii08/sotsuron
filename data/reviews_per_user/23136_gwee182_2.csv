Iron Man 3," Better Than 2, Not As Good As 1
","Safe to say I was hyped to see this movie. Any Marvel movie fan will be. I've also set expectations. Some were met, some weren't.I shall be like others and start with the positive stuff: The acting was good, especially RDJ who really delivered a powerful performance. Guy Pearce was exceptionally good. But, Ben Kingsley was underutilized.The action was fantastic, not once was I bored in the movie. Specifically, the Malibu House Destruction sequence, the Airplane Rescue sequence and the end fight. All were well done, none of which looked cheap.The SFX was Avengers caliber, so it was good.Now for the bad stuff: Only one major thing I had a problem with, and I'm sure to everyone else too. I'm gonna try not to spoil it as much as I can. There's a scene in the movie.. which... negates the background of a major character. Er... simple as it get? There's a bait and switch. There! If you watched it, you'll know what I mean.That's my only gripe about the movie.Overall rating: A-",Null,5,10,28 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Fantastic Sequel!!
","I wouldn't consider myself a Trekkie, but I loved the 2009 Star Trek. This movie had a lot of hype and I was one of them on board with it. It's safe to say, this movie surpassed my expectations!! I have a lot of good things to say about this, so in the words of a great man: Shall we begin?I will start with the acting. Everyone did a fantastic job. All did very well for their role in the movie, like in the 2009 version. However, things got interesting when Benedict Cumberbatch was announced as the main baddie. I love the guy, Sherlock is one of my favorite TV shows of all time and he kills it as Sherlock. When he was announced, I literally pooped my pants. When the first trailer came out, I was sold. He was one of the best parts about this movie. He had presence and was VERY menacing. Dude owns it as a bad guy.The SFX looked fantastic as usual (lens flares don't bother me). Nothing looked cheap, it made it feel more realistic (how I wished I watched it in IMAX) The story was simple enough, though a little rushed at the end. But it worked for this movie as it definitely feels like a part 2 of a series.One thing I like the mention is the sound. The music was great, the theme made it feel awesome. But the punches... my God, man! The punches felt very brutal. It was like... if the T-800 broke your bones by stomping on it, not the best description, but I'm going with it.Overall just a fantastic movie.I give this an A+It was better than the first one, to me. And in terms of sequels so far, I can say that Star Trek Into Darkness is a better sequel out now as compared to Iron Man 3.",Null,3,6,21 May 2013
