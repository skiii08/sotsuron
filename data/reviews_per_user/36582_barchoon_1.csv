Iron Man 3," Another Slap in the face for those who really care
","Movies: Some people love them and discuss them, some people just watch and care little about them. In the end this makes a huge difference to a movie review. Iron Man 3 is a movie for those who don't really care.If you love the character of Iron Man, other then being just something else to watch, there is little else to be found here. In many respects its like watching Star Wars: Episodes 1-3 or The Hobbit. It's dressed in a pretty package but there is no heart or longevity in the gift. The fact that the series may wrap up with this film leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, much like the disappointing The Dark Knight Rises. Also, a message for Disney: if you water down important adult story lines, in favor of the mass market, a little thing called originality and integrity is what will be lost in the long run.",6,19,38,27 April 2013
