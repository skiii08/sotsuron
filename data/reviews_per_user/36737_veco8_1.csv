Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Offensive and dumb? Sure...
","I have read on the comments that the 'movie film' has poor story, is ignorant about the Kazakh, unfair towards Americans and Anti Semitic...Well.. The fact is if you really have ANY wits, you will take the movie for what it is: it is a grotesque making fun of all the common-places, taking advantage of being utterly rood and insulting...And mocking the Jews is a common place as well, but hidden for being non-PC, and Cohen uses it to reveal the redneck nature of contemporary world....Take the movie for what it is - a hilarious film about the dumbness of all of us....And sure, Kazakhstan is country as any other, with asphalt roads, intelligent population, civil society and all... But I would not find my self offended if i were a Kazakh...But the ignorant part of the yanks just might :)) I just keep wondering if Pamela was informed about it all.....",10,1,11,8 November 2006
