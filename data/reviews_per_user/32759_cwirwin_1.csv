Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," sucked.
","two hours of my life that will never returnNowhere near as good as the REAL star wars trilogy!could have been called star wars episode 1: the phantom plot.Natalie Portman,Liam Neeson,Ewan McGregor, Frank Oz, and Samuel L Jackson did the best they could with this script that seemed like a bad ABC after-school special. what were these gifted actors thinking when they signed up?  This tripe is way below their talent level.The anikin kid was pathetic, i think he needs some acting lessons from Haley Joel Osment (sixth sense).Im so glad that The Matrix swept all the special effects oscars, and left this garbage with nothing.  In The Matrix, special effects were placed sparingly in the background to complement an intriguing story. In SWE1, special effects were placed in the foreground to make-up for an intellegence-insulting attempt at a story. It was as if Lucas and Co were hoping that a laser and light show would destract us enough for us to ignore plot structure.AND THE EFFECTS TOTALLY SUCKED! i mean the bluescreen shots of the bikes flying in the sky in E.T. were more convincing!  All in all, it seems that the Star Wars franchise is looking pretty grim at this point.",1,1,3,29 July 2000
