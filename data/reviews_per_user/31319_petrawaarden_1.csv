The Blair Witch Project," Good promo, hard to live up to
","What especially stands out about this movie is the promo: did this really happen? Did the students really got lost trying to film the blair witch? But too bad... when you buy the DVD and did not watch it in the theater you're in for a treat. It's not true, since in the DVD there is extra information about the students. That certainly put down my first experience with the blair with project. Now (some) 5 years later, and watching it again I like the movie better. It starts off with setting up a documentary and evolves in fighting strange experiences and voodoo, that all (combined with the ending) will leave you with an unsatisfied and awkward feeling at the end. But no horror and just a little thrilling...",6,1,2,21 July 2013
