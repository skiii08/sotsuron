The Equalizer," Denzel's films always have some sweet ass dialog!!
","I am a big fan of Training Day,that film is one of my favorite movies.The Equalizer has everything that Training day has,intriguing story,nice dialog,and decent fight scene.Compared with John Wick,both of the films have Russian mob. but The Equalizer is way better than John wick.John wick has some great action scene,simple and entertaining.they are both amazing in their own way,but The Equalizer has some serious atmosphere.It's probably the best action film in this year.I love when they take film seriously like this one,not like marvel's films.Of course they are complete different kinds of movies,but I just can't figure it out why films this day become childish and crappy.Overall,if you love Denzel's film then this movie is definitely worth to watch.",10,0,2,12 December 2014
