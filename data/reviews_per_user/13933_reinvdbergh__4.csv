Requiem for a Dream," Extremely powerful
","I vividly remember seeing Requiem For A Dream for the first time.A friend of mine was always talking about this movie how it would 'keep you away from drugs your entire life' and would be better than any drug movie I had ever seen.And well, I have to thank him for introducing me to this movie. He gave me his copy of his DVD to see it.I put in my DVD player and 90 minutes later, my hands were in front of my mouth out of amazement and I felt horrible, devastated and [insert a bad feeling here]. This movie dented my very soul, I kid you not. I was so impressed by the acting, the heart wrecking story and the raw emotion of this movie.I still can't believe that Ellen Burstyn was cheated out of this Oscar, losing to Julia Roberts, it's a shame... Only for her monologue to Harry when she's talking about 'a reason for getting up in the morning' is one of the most intense I know.Sheer brilliance!Also one that stands out is Marlon Wayan's performance. It surprised me too, only knowing him as a comedy actor.Well, if you haven't seen this one and can stand a pretty harsh movie, rent it, or buy it. Just see this one, it will change your vision about drugs and narcotics in general.9/10",9,0,1,23 December 2003
Dawn of the Dead," An impressive debut film.
","Hm, where do I begin. I guess I'll have to start from the beginning, eh?***MILD SPOILERS AHEAD***I remember reading something on IMDb on a Dawn Of The Dead remake somewhere last year I think. I clicked it, but no info was available yet, only the trailer. It didn't surprise me that I was thinking that this was going to be another flash-bang Hollywood stinker. (This movie may contain some Hollywood trademarks, but it's separate from the majority of crap).Boy, was I wrong. There was something about that trailer, especially the shot where Ana runs towards her car and sees the undead running across the street. That particularly shot sent shivers down my spine. The sound in that shot is slightly different in the actual movie, but that doesn't rob it from it's shock value.From that moment on, that movie was going to make me a Snyder fan.The week before the movie was going to be released, I was on a mission to find theaters where they would actually play this movie. Because I was concerned that it would play for only a week or so. And I was right pretty much, it disappeared out of theaters in less than a month. So I had to be quickly and race down to a theatre to see it day first.And I even didn't give a f**k that I had to see it without any company. I had to see this. The movie pretty much punches you in the back of your head from the first minutes, and doesn't stop until the very last seconds of the ending credits (the credits are VERY important, so don't flip it off when the story ends). You know, when the story immediately kicks in (no bullshit, just the story), that you are seeing a young and motivated director's film and tries to develop his own style (the amount of top shots for example).What really got me convinced that I had made the right choice seeing this movie is, were the opening credits. An incredible job in editing stock footage with actual shot footage and Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around'. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and wouldn't go down.From that moment on, you're in for a ride...Just enough character development to care about some of 'em and the amazing direction by Snyder. The decision to make the undead (I use the word 'undead' as the word 'zombie' isn't mentioned at ALL in the entire movie) run as fast as hell has proved to be a major plus. OK, slow zombies may be scary as s**t, but when they come after you like lightning, you're not even given the moment to p**s your pants. Because when you finally have, they are already chomping on your guts. How's that for a change, huh?The amount of gore they put into this pic, is not for the faint of heart. A lot of blood here, a whole lot! But hey, it's a fast and dynamic film, why not give the audience something they are craving for in an 'undead' flick: guts 'n' gore.I don't know if the 'light' moments in the film are suitable, but it gives the people some laughs before they get dragged in to the horror and action again (Andy is a great side character, whose ending is pretty graphic).I can't think of much that I disliked about this movie. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was a great breath of fresh air after the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, who lost all of it's shock value.Oh yeah, the extras on the DVD are top notch. This is what I call extra's, more story development (Andy's last days and 'We interrupt this program') and just enough 'making of' stuff to keep you interested. You should definitely listen to the director's comment by director Zack Snyder and a producer (his name I just forgot, there were eight producers or something like that).One of the best remakes to grace the silver screen. Good job!",Null,0,0,19 October 2004
Edward Scissorhands," Childhood memories...
","EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (Tim Burton) **** out of ***** (Contains maybe minor spoilers))One thing is for sure, this movie introduced me to the world of storytelling and movies in general at a young age.This is the first movie that I vividly remember seeing for the first time, some 10 years ago now I think. It HAS been 10 years ago since I've seen this movie. We taped it from television, and I watched it, I watched it, I watched it, until suddenly, the tape just disappeared. A very disappointing day in my life if you will :). 'Edwards Scissorhands' buried itself in to my memory as the most fascinating film I've ever seen.And now, some 10 years later, now that I'm attending film school, I had the chance to order it on DVD. You can imagine how happy and thrilled I was when got it in my hands. All the memories of the movie returned to me in an instant. I felt like a little kid for a second. This movie has been haunting me for all that time, 10 years without seeing it again, it was almost too much to bare.And what I expected, this movie hasn't dated one tiny bit (maybe for the first long shot of the town and the hill, where you clearly see that the hill is animated). I still consider this as one of both Burton's and Depp's best, without a doubt!The innocence that Edward radiates throughout the movie is just wonderful, you feel for him. If he feels fear (for example the scene where he is locked in Jim's house), you also can feel it, if he feels mad, you can understand why he feels mad. It's just amazing how Burton created such a fantastic character. It is a Burton says: 'Edward Scissorhands is about wanting to communicate, but not being able to'. I think this is the reason why I can connect to him. Like everybody else, I've been in such situations.
Visually, this is among the most breathtaking pieces of cinema that I know. Especially the mansion scenes with Edward and The Inventor create a rare feeling. And don't ask me what I think about the ending scenes, it's sad, sad, sad. Very hard to keep your tears to yourself. Beautiful scenery. Just see it for yourself, you will know what I'm talking about.Danny Elfman, the genius behind the theme music. I thank him for giving this movie that extra dimension that it needed. The music in 'Edward Scissorhands' keeps hauting you until you get amnesia, I will promise you that. Just brilliant...The is movie combines comedy, romance, drama, fantasy and so much more. It just all blends together in one fantastic film.Thank you Tim Burton and Johnny Depp for creating this.",9,0,0,26 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Something you haven't seen before, and never will again...
","*** May contain spoilers ***'The End'As the credits rolled on Return of The King and Annie Lennox's voice softly started singing 'Into the the West' I felt something I had never felt before concerning movies.Words almost cannot express my feeling towards this movie. It is almost impossible to write a review about this masterpiece. This is not a movie you see, it is one you experience. You get drawn into the screen and live the story.Because I loved the previous movies so much and absolutely adored the story (I have read the books, mind you), this was THE most expected film of my young life. I expected something pretty good, but this was something overwhelming, something mind blowing.I cannot write a descent review about it, so I will take some aspects from the film and discuss them.The story begins with Déagol and Sméagol having a innocent fishing trip, but a few minutes later it turns into a drama, with Sméagol murdering his friend (That's where Gollum's line 'Murderer' from The Two Towers comes from) and taking The Ring. Smart move by Jackson, putting this 'prologue' in the movie, so that people who haven't read the books know how Gollum came to be.In this film, you see more character depth than in the previous ones. With Sam and Frodo drifting apart, Merry and Pippin's separate paths, Aragorn accepting who he was born to be, Faramir's miserable relationship with Denethor, Théoden showing his iron strong will, and so on. It all shows...The photography here is some of the most most breathtaking I have ever seen. Some obvious examples are the lighting of the beacons in Minas Tirith and the shots that follow it,  Legolas standing outside The Golden Hall, the shots when Gandalf is ascending the seven rings of Minas Tirith, the battle sequences at Minas Tirith.The acting is somewhat the same as the previous ones, not something special, but very solid nonetheless. One performance truly stands out, Sean Astin's role as the loyal gardener, Sam. It's moving when you see a person that is so dedicated to his role as his. Excellent...Action, action, action... There is plenty, but unlike any other blockbuster action movie, it's something that will leave you grasping for air in your seat.The highlight of all the battle sequences (and believe me, there are plenty of them) is the charge of the Rohirrim at Minas Tirith. The opening shots of all those soldiers standing there, just seconds before they throw themselves into the armies of Mordor will give you goosebumps.But when Théoden starts speeching to his troops (Ride now!, Ride Now!... Death, DEATH, DEATH!!!) and march into battle, those were the most incredible scenes I have EVER seen. The combination of Howard Shore's Rohan's music that is sped up a little and the amazing editing of that scene almost made me cry out of amazement and had me not breathing for almost half a minute. Sounds strange huh, almost crying during a battle scene? But I guarantee you, you will be moved by this scene.The Army of The Dead was convincing too, not your average CGI characters, but looked incredible. You can really see the fierceness of the dead ones, because they fled from Isildur and went to the mountains to hide in shame, they were so eager to be released from their spell. You can see this in a scene in the background where you can see a Mumakil being torn town to the ground by these soldiers.And Shelob, wow, Shelob. It's beyond the Book. Scarier than I thought it would be, so quiet, so careful, so convincing. The scene where Frodo was stung by Shelob almost made me jump from my seat, very well done. Maybe a small flaw in these scenes is the fact that Frodo was stung, but does have his Mithril shirt on. Maybe this is a mistake, or Frodo just got stung in his upper leg.The Tower of Cirith Ungol and Minas Morgul were exactly as I imagined they would be.The ever miserable Gollum (not in the negative way) continues his way with the hobbits, meanwhile, he's cooking up a plan to regain the Ring. Again, magnificently acting by Andy Serkis. As for Gollum's end, it's slightly different than in the Books, but as he plunged into Mount Doom with the Ring, his expressions were kind of twisted. Knowing that he's falling to his death with the Ring and still smiling.
The music, well, one thing is for sure. Howard Shore did his homework, big time. One day after seeing RoTK, I went out and bought the OST (already owning the previous two). It's powerful, but less than The Two Tower's soundtrack. I was surprised by Billy Boyd's and Viggo Mortensen's appearance on the soundtrack. Emotionally charged music, a good way to describe it.
And there's one thing that 'rules' the movie. Goosebumps. I cannot count the times I had them during this movie. Maybe some examples to explain this...<ul><li>Gandalf saving Faramir and his troops when they flee to Minas Tirith (Just when Gandalf's staff begins to shine, the beautiful voice of Ben del Maestro is heard on the soundtrack, superb) - Pippin singing to Denethor as Faramir and his troops ride to their doom. - The Rohirrim charge at Minas Tirith as I sad before - 'For Frodo...' - The coming of the eagles at The Black Gate (the little moth appearing in front of Gandalf's face) - 'I cannot carry it for you, but I can carry you!'</li></ul>The ending is maybe a tad long, but still doesn't get boring in the end.As for the parts that were cut out for the theatrical release (being Saruman's scenes and The Scourching of The Shire), the movie is already up to 3h21m. any longer, people will be tired as hell. It's suitable for the Extended DVD, when you have all the time in the world. But it wouldn't work in the cinema, because you already have 5 or 6 endings to finish the movie.And watch out, a lot of people will cry during the endings!Well, that's about it. As far as I'm concerned, Star wars has been dethroned, concerning trilogies.A solid 10/10.",10,0,1,21 December 2003
