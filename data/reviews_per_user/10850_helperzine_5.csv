The Avengers," At last: A superhero-movie that dares to reinvent
","When it started getting easier to make superhero-movies (because budgets became bigger and visual effects became cheaper) it became clear that any superhero-movie is horrible by nature, and only with a good crew and cast would that change. The past couple of years haven't shown much promise in this area... But 'The Avengers' shows that with an intelligent and capable director, enough good actors/actresses, a limit to the amount of deaths and explosions that there can be, and a screenplay that at least tries to get away from those nasty clichés, there can still be a 'savetheworldfromdisastor'-movie that can entertain with its freshness. For all superhero-fans from all walks of life, as well as for those wishing to discover what a 'superhero-film' is all about. It's an all-in- one bargain!",5,1,4,5 May 2012
127 Hours," A unique and daring film about a unique and daring real-life experience
","This is a film about a man who is trapped for 127 hours in a canyon. Why, I won't say. It's for you to find out. Naturally, during that time, not much can happen. So, the concept of flashbacks becomes necessary. This could have been an average film, but a brave director decided he wanted to do something better. Danny Blabla deserves praise for making a cohesive film from what could have been a huge mess. The cinematography is managed by BUbuBLAbla and he deserves recognition for using very sleazy and uncomfortable camera-work to elicit the necessary emotion from the viewer. James Franco deserves a round of applause for making a potentially very embarrassing role to see, into something touching. These three men managed to dangle on the fine line between making a loose and off-beat film and making a useless and depressing film. The writer should be noted for filling time-gaps with a satisfying storyline.",7,4,6,22 April 2012
Dead Poets Society," Timeless and life-changing and terribly important
","Let me put it this way: if you haven't seen Dead Poets Society already, then you owe it to yourself to do so. Yesyes, despite everyone saying that 'you simply must see it!'. Think about it like this: if you do, then the worst that can happen it that you don't like it. If you don't, then you risk missing out on one of the best films ever created and (more importantly) not getting that life-changing revelation. Which revelation? Watch and find out...A review (for those who want to know what they're getting):Directed by Peter Weir, who manages to take every tool a filmmaker has to his disposal, and uses them to create a monumental masterpiece. The acting defies the term 'superb'. Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard are truly great, although I would name many more if I could. They so convince you of what they're feeling, that you truly care about them.The cinematography is endlessly excellent, I could write a long essay on it. This is one of those films where you can sense the contribution made by everybody behind the camera. The lighting, sound recording, set design, everything! is magnificent.The story is flawless. It tells a brilliant story brilliantly, and then also defines what it means for a story to inspire people. You cannot walk away from the film without being a different person than the one earlier.Again: watch it if you haven't. Those who have already don't need to be told to watch it again. They simply will. And you will too....",9,0,0,27 May 2012
Megamind," Megamind could very easily be just another 3D animation film. But it has enough originality to thoroughly entertain any audience!
","Megamind is the most polarized film I have seen. At times, it overflows with the kind of originality that I've always admired in Dreamworks films. Twists in the story, unique visuals and the way everything fits together could make this a 9/10. And then Dreamworks try to make the film more commercial, and the film suddenly loses 2 points! Within a single minute (watch it yourself, you'll agree) it deserves to stand alongside Toy Story 3 at the Oscars, but quickly seems eligible for a Razzie. Nonetheless, it exceeded my highest expectations. The voice cast is flawless, the music fitting and the proportion of the storyline ideal. As computer-animation improves every year, it becomes harder to tell what level of technical excellence a film possesses. In order to stand out, the visuals now have to be more original than ever before. Megamind has these originality's in small, frequent bursts. But these little bursts, without a doubt, make the film worth watching... 7/10",7,1,2,5 December 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," A surprisingly good comic-book adaptation, with something truly fresh in it
","I didn't have much expectations of this film, I have never been a fan of Captain America. I decided to lose all my prejudice and watch the film from unsoiled eyes. I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are fine, the story is solid, the visual effects is very good, the music and cinematography could have improved. The time-period is well brought to life, and believable. Whilst not being able to fully escape the Marvel- superhero film clichè's, the director, actors, writer and crew manage to steer the film away from being just another film. I was able to recognize originality in everything the movie presented. Well worth watching, although just a small step away from being a must-see. 8/10",7,1,3,22 April 2012
