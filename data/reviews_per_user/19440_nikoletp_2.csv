Angels & Demons," I hope this is the end
","I beg mister Howard..OK i know directing is a job, and as the DaVinci code brought lots of money it was expected to be a sequel...but OK..I just saw the movie and i don't even remember some of the parts..Don't anyone expect something more than the DaVinci..the same pattern!The cinema was full at 24:00 but this doesn't prove anything except from a lot of tickets...boring most of the time with some action rarely planted inside..I didn't recognize Tom Hanks as the movie don't let him saw his talent..From the point of the direction is of course higher level but the scenario is for 10 years old children..They have the talent (Howard,Hanks)...Please don't waste it.",6,7,43,13 May 2009
Saw," One Of the Best Thriller
","I expect to see Saw II and Saw III.If the next ones are as good as the first one, then we have to say that SAW is the best thriller series ever...The feeling It's something like the feeling when i first saw the 6th sense...It's something new which make you wanna see the hole series...It's a tough thriller with great scenario...Don't have to mention that this is my first article in IMDb so everyone understands that this movie has really moved me..I am not a thriller fun.I would say that i prefer other types of movies but that movie worth a lot!!Anyone should seen that movie as it lead us to a new kind of thriller movies..May be someone finds it too much but this is thriller my friend!!",8,0,1,24 April 2007
