Mission: Impossible III," Not as good as the first 2, but decent.
","I likes this move, but there wasn't as much of a plot as the first two. The beginning of the movie is very suspenseful, but it loses some momentum as the movie progresses. I think that the casting was very good for this movie. It seems that Ethan Hunt genuinely cares for his 'wife' and his wife cares for him. One thing that took off 2 stars (out of 10) was the explosive charge that the enemies put in his head. I thought that this was a definite blunder. I also thought that this movie was the least realistic of the 3. When Cruise gets thrown clear of the plane crash, and hits the car, he gets right back up and runs away. Thats not realistic. At all.",5,0,0,25 June 2006
Click," Very Clever
","This movie really makes you think about your life. Sandler plays a very busy Architect, Michael Newman, who needs a universal remote to control his TV. When he gets the remote, he finds out that there are some features that are not customary on a universal remote. There is a menu, which when pressed, will display every event in you life, as if you are there right now. Once you take control of this remote, it changes it settings to fit your needs. When Newman needs time to do things, he can Fast Forward, rewind, and pause his life so that he has time to complete his work, and soon, he grows attached to the device. This movie is wonderful. Highly recommended.",10,2,9,25 June 2006
V for Vendetta," Wonderful!
","This is one of my favorite movies ever. The story stars with Evey, a woman who is trying to visit her boss. When she is attacked by the police, a mysterious figure, V, helps her. When he meets her, he makes a speech using much alliteration with the letter V, ending with, 'You can call me V.' I think that is a very nice touch. The movie doesn't strongly follow the comic book, but this is not a disappointment. In the comic, each victim is killed in a symbolic way, but in the movie, they all get a lethal injection from V. When V is ready to execute his plan, he takes over the TV studio, and puts a mask on every person, similar to 'Inside Man' This movie is highly recommended.",10,12,23,25 June 2006
