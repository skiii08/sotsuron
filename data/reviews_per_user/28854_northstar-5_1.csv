Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Do unto others....
","I will only briefly state that the film manipulates subjects so that those of us who are 'in on the joke' get to feel smug and self-righteous. Who among us would like our worst moments captured on film for the rest of the world to watch? Subjects who appeared in the film have noted that they were misled and were rushed into signing releases so their likenesses could appear in the film. Because of Borat, people will become cynical and reluctant to participate in films such as this one.The greatest task in a film such as this one belongs to the editors. And you have to wonder how much good will landed on the cutting-room floor.",4,9,18,12 November 2006
