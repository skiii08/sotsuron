Iron Man 3," Shane black success broke my heart of iron man!
","first of all, i will review this not only based on the comic but also the trilogy and my logic....i watch this movie in Imax (i expected this is climax of iron man with much more iron man than IM1 n IM2..) but Shane Black devastate my expectation when i found the strongest Mandarin is such a JOKE!Okay, I've read all the comments,,pro's and con's.... i love marvel films and the director for marvel films should have much more fantastical idea not logical idea.... its okay for a movie to not follow the comic/novel/arts/you name it storyline.... But this! MANDARIN you gone very wrong about him shane....argh! I've thought this mandarin will shows in the end or reveal the clue for the real mandarin but its not.... why the he wears 10 rings but its only for props of propaganda broadcast video in this movie???? at least don't kill Mandarin char with that plot of joke!!!! (mandarin loves power...not chicks and drugs *ARGH!).....for the other reviewer thats support the mechanical things with this kid i understand, you may think Tony don't have resource to repair its armor rite? or maybe shane want to describe how genius tony is? the question is, why tony after revive jarvis in MK42 did not command his backup to pick him up instead of steal a car?! or it saves for the climax? what a jerk..this is not Jason bourne......again ARGH!for extremis that broke down IM suites i still could not accept this....Tony found the new element for material of the armor rite? (in IM1 its described) its strong...thats why he could join the avenger (as his father found Vibranium for Capt.) ..... MK6 could bear lightning bolt from thor.. (maybe jarvis could send the shocks to be absorbed) but lighting itself has great heat than extremis...or you might to said that the extremis heat is focusing in 1 point attack? not really....remember the avenger that MK6 is hit by Mjolnir the great hammer of universe....and the suites don't bent rite? only scratch .... its 1 focus point attack... again ARGH!!!!Iron Patriot could be hack i could only accept this as Don it modified by AIM...it could be backdoored... yeah fine...and what made me wants to cry is why the hell is Tony lift up his arc reactor in his chest so easily? he is ultra-genius guy who create pure energy,...but why in the first IM1 he did not surge himself to lift his arc-reactor chest at once??? surely he don't have problem to do this surgery.....again ARGH!!!to be conclude Shane Black is not appropriate for directed a Marvel movies that needs fantastical fictional imagination and knows deep about Marvel. The trailers deceive me, the mandarin seems powerful but the fact is such a joke.... Less-ironman....this movie should called 'Tony Bourne'..... please bring Favreau back!!!!! Kick shane out marvel!!!!",6,5,10,28 April 2013
