One Hundred and One Dalmatians," He-Man Masters of the universe
","I just wanna say that this movie, Dolph plays his own stunts & I think that he should do more stunts in more movies that he's in. Dolph is in his 40's or early 50's ( I don't know which),but, he looks good for his age. If someone so happens to know his age & when he was born e-mail me @ regerdjr3@earthlink.net.He's really great with his work . I think that he has a wife & kid (I'm not sure). I just know that I'm a big fan of his & he knows that he has fans all around the world speak in every launage. When I say He-Man Master of the Universe, I was 13-Years-Old @ the time. It came on 2 days after my 13th B-day. then he teamed up with a few other stars, which was very interestin' to me.",10,2,7,16 February 2005
