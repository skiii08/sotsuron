Iron Man 3," The Mandarin's Twist
","The Mandarin seemed exciting to me when I first saw the trailer. However, I was disappointed to learn that Ben Kingsley's character was nothing more but a drunk British actor acting as a decoy to the real bad guy, the Guy Pearce character. Guy's character didn't even have a lot of depth, he's just as pathetic as the way Hayden Christensen performed Darth Vader in the Star Wars prequels. Seriously, man?! I mean isn't the Mandarin's twist sort of a ripoff of Batman Begins with the way Ras Al Ghoul is depicted? Both the Mandarin and Ras Al Ghoul are terrorist leaders, that's obvious, and both use decoys to punk the hero. When the live Justice League movie comes out, I guess folks are gonna argue which one ripped off the other, the Justice League or the Avengers?",6,0,3,4 May 2013
