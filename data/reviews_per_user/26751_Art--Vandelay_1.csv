Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This film must be viewed again
","The Phantom Menace was released to mixed reviews. The positive were thankful to see a back story of the classic Star Wars trilogy and to again be captivated by the Force, Jedi and lightsabers again. However, the negatives focused on poor dialogue, the needlessly long pod race, Jar Jar Binks, fart jokes and a story that seemed to raise many unanswered questions.Yet everyone failed to see the movie's bittersweet tone and its inherent innocence as a contrast to what the next two movies would bring.The above sentence is only possible because the trilogy is now complete. The Phantom Menace, therefore, must now be looked at through the eyes of Revenge of the Sith. The Phantom Menace is much more powerful in the context of Episode 3.The characters, especially young Anakin and Qui-Gon Jinn, give the viewer a more whole sense of the Star Wars saga. One can't help feeling sadness and regret when they see an innocent 9-year old who gives freely to others, knowing the suffering that person will end up giving and receiving when he becomes and adult. Yet, there is a bit of hope as well because we know that eventually he will be redeemed. We can go back and realize the greatness in Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn, the man who discovers the Chosen One. This can only be observed after learning in Episode 3 that it is Qui-Gon who first learns the path to immortality. It is his teachings that usher in a New Jedi Order. One realizes that without these new perspectives learned by Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the training of a Luke Skywalker that is resistant to the dark side cannot be possible.So, the advice of this author is to watch The Phantom Menace again with Episodes II-VI in mind. In this way you will find the movie far more satisfying.",9,7,10,19 August 2005
