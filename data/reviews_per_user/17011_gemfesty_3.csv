Ford v Ferrari," Tracy Letts
",With so many great performances by big names I think particular recognition for Tracy Letts is much deserved. That test drive scene was something else.,9,1,2,25 November 2019
The Irishman," Too long
",This really didn't need to be 3 1/2 hours long. The movie was enjoyable for the first 2hrs then you just want it to end already.,7,1,4,4 December 2019
Joker," Uncomfortable viewing
","The unique perspective causes you to feel quite empathetic for a character capable of great evil.
Minus one star because the clown makeup was applied a little too heavily in the final scenes of the movie, obfuscating the actors face. I found some of the amazing facial expression from earlier in the film was lost.",9,1,1,10 October 2019
