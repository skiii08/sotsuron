Hereditary," Dont believe the hype...
","I had a lot of expectations for this movie.. But I came out of the cinema thinking «wtf». The auidience was laughing at the ending of it. And all had the same «wtf» moment. Great actors yes, but the movie itself is not worth wasting money on.",1,26,58,24 June 2018
