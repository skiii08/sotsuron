The Avengers," And Assemble they did!
","This film was under a lot of pressure to deliver after all of the great advertisement and the continuous after credit scenes to all of the Marvel films. I must say my expectations weren't high after Iron Man 2 and Captain America but I must say this film was highly enjoyable and from start to finish it has you gripped.It was adventurous, it was comical and the story was great. All of the actors delivered a great performance especially Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. Their perceptions of their characters were great and you couldn't ask for much more.The story itself had so many moments that just kept you in anticipation to see what happens next and this included with the comical moments just made you want more.The only downsides to this film were that some of the characters didn't feel as used as others such as Hawkeye and Black Widow but this is only a minor issue. The other problem is that the film had to end! I seriously could have kept watching if it went on much longer, it was just that good.This will most certainly be one of the best films this year alongside The Dark Knight Rises and Prometheus.Overall I give this film an 8.4 due to its excellent delivery of the story and the acting was spot on. I would recommend this film to anyone and I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.Remember to stay after the credits...",7,2,6,13 May 2012
Prometheus," Original, Intellectual and an overall modern-classic
","Okay so I saw this at a midnight preview and I really did enjoy the film. Sure you could argue that it was for A L I E N fan boys and that it lacked as much enjoyment for others but that was their clear target audience as observed by the trailers.As many of you believe and it is true, the characters aren't developed enough so that you care when they die. Yes, in most cases this would be considered a flaw in my opinion but with this particular film I do not agree because it had so much story to tell and things to do in just 2 hours so I didn't really give a damn about character development because it was an original, story based movie.The story itself was a truly new kind of take on a sci-fi film because although space travel and new worlds has been previously explored, its concept is much more different therefore creating a newer and more profound experience. Not just the story in its journey either, each detail such as the life-creating bio-mass that explains many things to man's commonly asked questions and even the origins of the main idea to the xenomorph.The acting was admittedly low in certain areas but with Fassbender, Rapace and certain other members including Pearce bringing great performances it didn't matter too much and like I said before it is a story-based movie.The bad elements that other people are mentioning such as it not being a direct prequel to A L I E N well all I can say to that is that it isn't a 'direct' prequel, Scott intended it to be an original piece so for that reason it is great and it leaves you asking questions which is good because a mystery solved is a mystery forgotten so Scott has clearly left us with similar feelings that A L I E N left us with.Overall I give it a 9/10, it would have reached a 10 if it was longer because this would have allowed for stronger character development and greater performances overall from the actors/actresses so hopefully this may come with the DVD/Blu-ray release for this movie.Good job!",9,7,20,2 June 2012
