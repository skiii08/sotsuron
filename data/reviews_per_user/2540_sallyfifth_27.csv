Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Bloody Satisfaction without so much blood
","Excuse me if I gush for a minute. Ho ho ho. Kill Bill vol. 2 is basically perfect. All the arm- chair directors out there will be scratching their heads wondering why they can't find anything wrong with the film, NOT A THING. The movie should satisfy all those that had reservations about Vol. 1. The basic story is the same but the characters are deeper, the emotions more palpable and the dialogue more QT-ish. The success of the film is that it's so much fun, and so exhilirating yet it still rings with emotional resonance. At the heart of the story is this simple fact 'The Bride will Kill Bill.' It's not about the story perse. It's about the little flourishes and footnotes. You gotta love Gordon Liu playing the wizened Kung-fu Master Paimei whose legend though at first seeming to be a string of bad cliches, you'll find yourself enthralled with anyway. You gotta love how seamlessly QT switches genre's and styles, and yet invests each switch and each new piece of the story with enough life to support a film of its own. You gotta love how the movie flaunts its irony without ever becoming cloy, or distracting from the story. An exciting film that blends technique, homage, and storytelling flawlessly.",Null,0,1,16 April 2004
The New World," Frustrating but Ultimately Rewarding
","It's a shame that Terrence Malick has never found the balance between what we see and what we know in his films. At this late stage I'm beginning to think it's too late for the old dog to learn new tricks. As with 'The Thin Red Line', you'll be hard-pressed to find a better looking film in the genre, but this is both the movie's gift and its curse. The New World is like getting a stack of postcards, sixty years late, addressed to your grandmother from her then boyfriend who soon after died in the war. It's words are few, careful and secret. It's pictures lush and exotic. It speaks of a feeling that somehow lasted through the ages. If you were to film the 'story' you discerned from those post cards -from the feelings buried in the margins- you would have 'The New World'. A film so transcendental it transcends the audience, and leaves us behind as it continues to run unhindered by our needs anymore. Half Discovery Channel documentary, half Pocahontas home video collection, the movie tells a historically accurate version of the events that lead to Pocahontas travelling to England to meet the Queen. It's lucky that the girl they found to play her embodies her inquisitive, energy so well because the movie rests almost entirely upon her shoulders. Ferrel playing John Smith, like a sad sack washed out baseball player, does admirably in their minimalist scenes together. Creating a sense that we're watching what can never be put into the words of history, because history isn't interested in love, only sin. There's not much exploding, and very little action for those thinking 'big historical epic', but you will find painstaking detail, and one of the harshest looking portrayals of the hard winter suffered by the British that first year after making landfall. Overall, a frustrating but ultimately rewarding experience that might play better in a museum than in a theater.",Null,1,4,29 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," If you Don't like this, you Don't like movies.
","I was thinking... how can I top what Roger Ebert and just about every other critic has said about this film... and then it struck me. 'If you don't like this, you don't like movies' or more accurately, 'if you don't like Spiderman 2, what is it you seek from movies?' Seriously. Every frame packs emotional resonance of some kind. Whether it be dramatic, comedic or just the kind that gets your heart pumping. The film values its character's so much, that it never betrays them. There are no shortcuts. And despite what a lot of the (internet) critics of the film are touting, it's not really overly talky or preachy, and it's never boring. Raimi and Co. have masterfully let what's up on the screen do most of the talking, through images,  looks, sounds.  It's been said that to critique a film you must make a better one, I think that applies here. Spiderman 2 makes Spiderman look somewhat rudderless. The action this time packs more of a punch, the villain is creepier, the romance hits higher highs and lower lows, the pace is smoother, the comedy is funnier, and all the characters get just about the right ammount of screen time. In the first Spiderman we had a lot of odd fills (Aunt May at the Hospital), and scenes too misplaced to have meaning, (Gobby and Spidey meet on the building). Raimi looks to have come to terms with the source material's medium this time out, and he and his crew don't waste even a minute of screen time.
Who here didn't just love that scene in the elevator with Spiderman and Hal Sparks? That sense of fun combined with the drama, and some fantastic performances by Tobey, James, Kirsten, Molina, JK and uh.. the woman who played Aunt May (sorry ma'am), made this a can't miss film.",Null,1,1,3 July 2004
Insomnia," Tight and Engaging.
","Well, frankly the rest of this IMDB lot seem to need some sleep, because Insomnia was the most satisfying movie of 2002. Hands Down.All the kiddies better go to bed though, this is an adult movie about a very serious ethical dilemma. The sheer panic and tension that fills every beautifully shot scene, had my stomach in knots. Robin Williams plays just the right level of creepy, to Pacino's strung out, compromised no bullshitter. You haven't seen Pacino this 'on' in years.One amazing thing is that the movie never misfires. Every scene hits it's target dead on, from the terrifying chase across the logs, to Pacino's verbal beat down on the victim's best friend.Everyone should see this movie.",Null,0,0,11 April 2003
Silent Hill," That Silence you Hear, is Laughter
","What to make of this odd big-little film. It's clearly a Lynchian nightmare-scape, but it offers one too many clues to its unraveling in some of the most boring exposition put to film ever. Like DOOM, it makes the unappealing choice of translating the game to the big screen literally, even lifting camera angles, a startling sense of geography, a sequence of controller directions and more than 45 minutes of running and opening/trying to open drawers, doors and bathroom stalls. In that way, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. Not a good thing, because it's absolutely unnecessary as is the Husband's story, which eats up about a half hour too and reveals nothing we couldn't have assumed from Rose's story. The positive side is that it's beautiful and atmospheric in an almost masochistic way. The demons are to die for, the locales are devilishly delightful and the story is an interesting one (albeit told in a bland way). Sadly, it's just too unintentionally hilarious too often, and it really ruins the experience (unless of course you came for a good belly laugh or two). Of particular note is the frequent uttering of 'Everything will be OK' at two of the most inopportune times ever. Now, maybe on paper, this was supposed to sound like 'denial' but on film, the actress and director play the lines straight, which just hurts. I wish Silent Hill was a better film, because all the workings were there. But as is, it's going to be more of a curiosity than a classic. Much like 'The Brotherhood of the Wolf' Gans has yet to make me care about his movies as anything more than abstract art.",Null,2,4,29 April 2006
Capote," Hype isn't just for Blockbusters
","I will admit to getting wrapped up in Capote's dilemma by the second half of the film, but as interesting as the man's real life story is, the film offers too little backstage access to Capote for us to understand the central relationships which make the crux of the film. The fact is, as played by Hoffman or anyone, the man is too engimatic on screen to elicit our sympathies. It might have helped if the movie wasn't shot like a stage play; with long, staid scenes that never build up enough steam to carry the audience into the next. For all its faults the movie is well paced, and it kept me invested in its outcome. And I've just got to say it, that voice is aggravating, real or not.",Null,1,3,3 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 'so bad, it's gone past good, and back to bad again'
","is a quote from Ghostworld. And it applies here. This movie is badly made. Putting aside the plot. The monsters sucked. The alien designs were lame. The battles were god awful, and most of them were ripped from other movies. And this lame beast of a movie has to limp through two plus hours to reach its Saturday Morning cartoon finale, which has neither drama, nor wit. Lucas reaches new lows, trying to stretch his movie out with scenes of Obiwan going to the library. When I watch Star Wars, I think fantasy, I think exotic. There is nothing exotic about the library. For every place the movie goes right, it takes an inexplicable turn for the revolting.
Now the plot. Just because when you write out the political backstory on a paper and read it to yourself it's exciting and intelligent, doesn't mean Lucas sucessfully filmed it that way. In fact he didn't, he just had his characters tell it to you in very non creative new-story style.
Of all the crimes I've listed that this movie committed, it's worst was by far this: It's boring. REALLY boring. Even for children and monkeys. There's not a stretch of this movie that's captivating in anyway. It's a strictly pedestrian affair when it should be flying high above us all.",Null,3,7,4 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Three Cheers for Conviction of Vision.
","I admire the Bros. Warchowski for carrying out a vision to its inevitable end. Revolutions is like a Beatles song. There's a whole lot of nothing being said (on screen) but the message is clear: All you need is love. Revolutions is all about Peace. An end to the war, which unfortunately plays like a techno geek war picture. People cheering, characters dying in long drawn out heroic style, and guns guns guns... with no dramatic punch. The only really interesting part of the story is Neo's. And I'd imagine he's on the screen less than half the movie.
The attack and the fight for freedom etc. is all very awe inspiring the first few times you see the squids attacking, but boy the whole thing gets monotonous. And heavy handed. And... did I mention monotonous? The final confrontation is good. And some might say, the picture stretches out just to build the tension for it. But I have to think there's better ways to do so.
But heck, this one's worth seeing for the final fight and a fairly satisfying conclusion to the series. Which makes the wonderful claim that Love is the ultimate chaos. As any one who has ever been will readily attest to.",Null,0,0,6 April 2004
The Village," Not bad.
","I smartly avoided all but the original creepy trailers for M. Night's new flick, and thus I avoided all hints of the twists and even the basic premise of the film. I went in blind much like the main character, and like Ivy I could see the colors of this film, that most of you (including Roger Ebert) have missed. The Village is a movie with several layers that get peeled back as the story reaches its climax. First and foremost I would say it is a period romance. Innocent and charming. The success of the film is that it peels away a layer and makes you question that innocence. There is an almost Puritan sense that what is pleasurable is sinful, and the use of vague words like 'the bad color' and 'those we do not speak of' is more about the parts of their own humanity the 'Villagers' have supressed than it is about ghouls and monsters. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone reading this so it will be difficult to discuss any further, but suffice to say 'The Village' is not about what lurks in the forest. It's about what lurks in the heart.",Null,0,0,3 August 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Carell and Apatow do justice to the human race.
","Thank god for Steve Carell and Judd Apatow who single (or would that be double) -handedly have saved American Comedy, a dying breed, I know. The 40 Year Old Virgin is the fun, raunchy, and downright heartwarming tale that Wedding Crashers tried, and mostly failed, to be. Steve and the entire supporting cast including the gorgeous Catherine Keener play the movie straight, and the laughs are never forced or farcical. I'm going to go ahead and disagree with other comments that claim the movie's long running time works against it, by saying that it's refreshing to see a movie that isn't always rushing to the next gag, but hitting its marks like a professional. Me and mine haven't laughed so much at a comedy in years, and we're fairly certain that if you don't find this funny and claim to be a fan of movies, you either need to lighten up or get laid. Funniest movie of the year is a given, but it may just be one of the funniest in the last ten years. A real charmer that both guys and gals will enjoy equally. We loved it.To whoever it was that walked out and went to see Valiant instead, I say: Man, that's punishment enough right there.",Null,2,6,23 August 2005
Spider-Man," Does Spidey Justice.
","Though I have serious issues with some of the 2nd half,who cares. It was fun. I grinned from cheek to cheek. And it delivered in all the ways it had to. Sam Raimi working with a good script kept things nice and fast. The movie gives us several good characters, great action scenes, and a story with some issues we can all relate to. If you're going to make a mass market spidey this was as good as it could have been. I wish they'd lightened up a bit sometimes though, Spidey isn't Batman. And hopefully in the next film  they'll remmeber why we love spidey, as will Tim Burton who didn't bring anything memorable to the film's score.",Null,0,0,9 November 2003
Saw III," Good Help is Hard To Find
","SPOILERSThe third installment in the SAW series finds everyone's favorite unsolicited life guru Jigsaw struggling with his new help, Amanda. You see, Amanda, whom we see in Flashback dedicating herself completely to Jigsaw after having survived his games (from Saw I), isn't entirely in tune with Jiggy's altruistic vision. You see, she keeps setting up the games to be unwinnable. Bummer, that. Saw III is basically one really long (and bloody) employee evaluation that sadly, she fails. The tricky thing about Saw III is that it's trick is less obvious. The twist is not so much a revelation as a culmination. Many people are left wondering why so much of the movie is spent dwelling on the past two episodes but if you're paying attention you'll figure this out easily. Every SAW film has told the story of the players in the game through Flashback. What at first glance appears to be 'Saw: Behind the Mayhem' turns out to be the most important clues to why Amanda was chosen for this particular game. The death traps this time out are as inspired as the first two, though probably a bit too elaborate for a deadly duo to construct. The Rack is especially stretching it (pun intended). However, the movie is smart in that it shows us that Jeff has enough time to save these unfortunate souls before that clock ticks down, but he's too focused on who these people are to keep his wits about him. While the plot holes are numerous and gaping, the story keep moving briskly forward, leaving little time to dwell on the questions that afterward plague the brain. Like: How did Jigsaw know Jeff wouldn't die grabbing the key? How did he know that the other dude would? What is his plan B? I think people who liked the first two movies will come around to this one eventually. It's got gore, surprises, and it's brings Amanda & Jigsaw's story to a logical conclusion.",Null,0,0,2 November 2006
No Country for Old Men," Socks for Christmas
","Or Kissing your Cousin. Use whichever cliché best describes the final thirty minutes of this film. Some of the most deflating and frustrating minutes you will have on this earth. But let's start at the beginning so you understand why. No Country for Old Men is Set-up as a taut, B-movie thriller with a mad man on the loose trying to track down his stolen money from a guy way in over his head. The killer Cigurgh even has a gimmicky way of getting into people's houses and a cool gun. That it aspires to so much more in its first 3/4 is a true testament to the style and wit the Coens display when they get behind a project. The problem is that the excitement and promise of a final showdown is put aside literally in order to make some points about world weariness. According to a friend who read the original book -that's how the novel ended too. Yet after watching the mind-blowingly awesome set-up, you wish the Coens would have realized what their movie needed and not what the novel demanded they do. Because it wasn't just a matter of choosing the ending, the problem lies in how it was executed and how they integrated switching narrative perspectives. What starts as a thriller eventually becomes a campfire story about the boogeyman and the people too tired and too world weary to stop him. You can't have your cake and eat it too. But there are far worse things to be than daring and ambitious. And nothing the movie does wrong is a deal breaker. I still recommend it. No one but the Coens can make a candy wrapper look so menacing.",Null,1,6,28 November 2007
28 Days Later...," Great look, but what happened?
","Let me get out first that the movie looks great. The composition of scenes is just startling in a way cinema truly should be. The story starts out so incredibly strong, and the characters so logically written, that the third act feels like a different movie. Like Resident Evil 2. As a treatise on Human Nature maybe this was necessary but storywise it struck me as out of character for all involved. Enjoyable, but the potential was there for a really strong ending, and I can't help but think Boyle blew it.",Null,0,0,1 October 2003
X-Men: The Last Stand," Honestly, A Waste of Time
","You know what, Ellen Page was great as Kitty Pryde. And the scene with her and Juggernaut was fun in a way most of this film wasn't. I also liked the Angel character's introduction. Something the other X Movies gave us in abundance. What else was good? Ian Mckellan as Magneto. And the set-up was fantastic. What's that 15 minutes of the movie? Beast was decently realized, but he ate up screen time without adding much to the film.The bad... everything else. Action scenes lacked smarts. The clockwork showdown between Pyro & Iceman, against all logic, fizzled out due to lack of breathing room. Especially ill conceived was the decision to have the 'Good vs. Evil'-which-color-will-win battle? Who asked for more Halle Berry as Storm?? While her acting isn't as unbearable as the last two films, her role in the story is so small, that devoting so much screen time to her seems like a braindead move. Also braindead? Including the Dark Phoenix. That's a second trilogy right there. It's just too much too soon. And there's already a perfectly good story built into The Last Stand: The cure. That brings things full circle. Folks, I wouldn't be so harsh if there hadn't been a great set-up. This is still decent Summer Popcorn movie fare. The point is, the first two movies were so much more. The Last Stand is like a carefully planted garden that was just starting to sprout, when someone decided to build a hotdog stand on the spot. You may like hotdogs, but they won't quench your soul.",Null,17,31,31 May 2006
Hellboy," It's got enough good stuff.
","Hellboy is a good character. John Meyers is not. The Nazi Robot Surgery Man is awesome. Selma Blair's character is underdeveloped. The Fishman Abe-sapien rules. The hell beasts are too generic. The films looks great, the pacing is sporadic and the plot a bit too confusing. It's got some good hero-ey dialogue, it's got some real clunkers. The Hellboy/Liz story is cute and generates some genuinely warm moments the Triangle with John sucks life out of the screen like a giant leech. The zombie in the graveyard is fanatstic, the masoleum in the graveyard is goofy, and there's a plot hole you could drive the proverbial truck through. For everything good the movie does, it does something equally offensive. It's all enjoyable, but I gotta say, it feels like a bit of a letdown, considering how close they came to something just a little better. A fun time especially if you set your brain to submissive.",Null,0,0,11 April 2004
Hero," A step forward in Chinese Cinema, but its dense
","If I were rating the movie on its visuals, I would have given it a ten. But I'm not, am I? So it gets a six. This film, like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, is an attempt to take another look at Chinese martial arts hero epics. But gone is the comedy and wit of the Tsui Hark pics, and in its place is a dense and thick melo drama, that plays on the screen as a greek legend would. Stiffly. While it's all very exhilirating, and the colors and photography of the film are so vivid and alive, the structure kept me from getting inside the characters and frankly I think its frustrating. I admire what Zhang Yimou was trying to do here, but I think Western Audiences will agree that the dramatic tension doesn't translate well, and the end bit leaves you sort of empty.Definitely recommended though.",Null,0,0,2 October 2003

At times scary, at times funny, it's like a hallucination, a wet dream and a bad trip.It's a rip on Hollywood, and it's a slap in the face to lazy filmmakers. It's exhilirating.

Shrek 2," Puss n' Boots. Nuff Said.
","I love the fact that the people who made this movie were clearly in love with it and it's characters,  that the same divine spark that created the first one seems to be behind the second one but, as I was sitting there in the theater watching the movie, I kept feeling like there was no movie. That is... until Puss n' Boots comes on screen and injects life into things. Antonio Banderas is hilarious as the Fairy Tale feline, but of course his performance wouldn't have been nearly as fantastic without the animators behind him. Every time Puss was on the screen I was laughing. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie just didn't do it for me. I just couldn't find the movie when Puss wasn't on screen. I couldn't care about Shrek or Fiona this time, a lot of the jokes seemed tacked on. Like in the second and third Austin Powers' film's. Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy godmother also failed to get me going. but man when that cat is licking itself... hoo weee... I was laughing.",Null,0,0,3 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Instinctive movie making.
","Whatever Kill Bill's faults, at least it IS. Here's a film that does not pussy foot around, it goes straight to the nerve endings. With a preponderance of movie's in the cineplex that want to be everybody's best friend, I'm glad Tarantino had the guts to make a film that shirks off our advances and hangs out smoking in the bathroom. Kill Bill is instinctive movie-making. The story (at least in volume one) is a straight path, one which Uma as The Bride cuts with a samurai sword. Everything that happens is part of an equation that even a fourth grader could solve. It's what Quentin scribles within the lines of his script that make everything so fascinating. I must admit though, I was bothered by the Japanese in the film, as I live in Japan and speak the language myself. It was embarassing. And I wish they had kept it to a minimum since I had to watch it with native Japanese.
Go see this movie, if you like exploitation films, or just movies that come at ya looking for a fight.",Null,0,1,31 October 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I cannot contain my love for this film.
","I would write love letters to it, if that were even possible.
I loved Human Nature and Charlie Kaufmann has yet to lead me astray. That being said, I think he and Michel Gondry have come up with a film that resonates on an emotional level unseen in the cinema for a long time. Eternal~ comes across almost like a stage play, with interior monologues taken from the main character's journal, and a manic energy that seems not constructed but found on screen. Kate Winslet is pitch perfect as the soon-to-be- forgotten love interest, who's so imperfect and real you can almost smell her. The reason this film is so brilliant is because it risks everything. Jim Carrey is not instantly likeable. He and Kate have the kind of chemistry high school on-again-off-again sweethearts do. They seem like they're just killing time with eachother. How can the audience connect? Dunno but we do. And it pays off. Hats off to Kristen and Elijah who also play fundamentally damaged people. They almost mirror each other. The film stings. And it threatens to turn you off more than a few times, but if you stick with it, by the end you'll be reeling. You'll not find anything else as interesting or emotionally satisfying at the multiplex this year.",Null,0,1,25 March 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Slept Cheered Cheered Slept
","Never has a movie toyed with me more. Nice action sequence to open, then what seemed like hours of waiting for something interesting, I mean the stuff in Zion is no Episode Two like 'Obiwan goes to the library' kind of filler, but it's still filler all the same. Then we get to the promised land and Neo fights Smith after Smith after Smith. This delivered eventhough the scenes lacked the dramatic tension earlier confrontations had. The pacing was erratic in this flick. The fight scenes got almost monotonous. I still was held in wonder at the highway scene.And I actually thought the Architect stuff was good mostly due to a nice performance from the actor playing him. This movie needed to be trimmed though, cut out most of Zion,come up with a better storyline than 'the keymaster' and cut down on some of the extraneous stuff, and it would have been a contender. As of this point the first movie is by far the more inspired and I really can't suggest this one for anything but a few choice cuts.",Null,0,0,4 November 2003
The Fountain," Ever been in Love?
","Critically drubbed and a commercial flop, The Fountain, is lining up behind 2001: A Space Odyssey as the most misunderstood film of its era. What's so fascinating is that if you've ever been in love with someone other than yourself, the movie makes total sense. My wife and I watched it only once and that was enough. Despite what some are saying I don't think this needs multiple viewings. It stirs powerful emotions with just about every frame, and lays out a logical visual narrative that reaches a beautiful conclusion. The 'story' may take longer to process, but its rather inconsequential and in some cases left up to interpretation. What's important here is watching with your heart exposed. Not ground breaking by any means, but still an irreplaceable experience.",Null,0,1,27 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Way we dreamed it could be.
","The prequels until this point had been shamelessly empty. In episodes I & II half aborted ideas, were poorly scripted poorly filmed, and poorly realized. Lucas is unapologetic in this regard. Just read any interview about Revenge of the Sith. The man admits that he had very little to say with either the Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones, the man himself calls them 'mostly filler'. While he may be right that we were at fault for wanting to skip to the end, Revenge of the Sith proves that that's exactly where everything we've been waiting for happens. You can't blame us. Finally it seems like Lucas' dream of digital cinema is alive and not just some technogeek- wet dream. The action is fresh, gorgeous, well plotted and paced and most of all, fun. The bad guys this time around are inspired. We no longer have lame gymnastics acts like Darth maul or the laughably under developed Count Dooku, we have an awkward coughing cowardly robot general named Greivous, who engages Obi Wan in one of the coolest fights in Star Warsdom. The action and the drama is brisk and well plotted, and the pay off is bliss. No trips to the library this time. Anakin's turn to the darkside though a bit murky at times, makes sense, and supports the second Trilogy well. What's really exciting is that the movie doesn't pretend that you don't know the end this time. It plays off the fact that you know the end, and it teases you. I found the acting adequate and at times moving. Hayden gets a lot of flack, but I think he works with the material well, and his brooding is subtle enough that he doesn't give it all away at once.The Birth of Vader is handled well, and the darkness of the film, though a downer for the kids who were prepared for something more cartoonish, is a welcome change, but not the saving grace of the movie. The saving grace is that, everything has meaning, and everything works towards the finale. Which is quite breathtaking a real stand up & cheer moment.",Null,1,2,21 May 2005
The Terminal," Good Way to Kill a Few Hours
","Steven Spielburg has started to be a really good director again. Not so much because he's a visionary, but because he just isn't forcing things anymore. Like Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal is innoculous but well meaning fun. Going to see a Steven Spielburg movie these days makes me feel like I'm 'out-at-the-movies' again. Ultimately The Terminal offers very little that will stick with you when you leave the theater, but like it's main character, it's just so charming and unopposing during your brief stay with it you'll have a grand 'ol time.

The Simpsons Movie," A Homer with Bases Loaded.
","Just about everything I could have hoped for from a Simpsons movie including the heart the show has been lacking for several seasons now. If you like the easy breathing pace of the early years of The Simpsons you'll find a lot to like in the movie. The gags are leisurely and natural and even when they fail (Comic Book Guy comes to mind), another drops in to pick up the laugh. What's most surprising, in addition to a much needed return to consistent characters, is that the movie manages to balance the plot and the gags with near perfection. Regardless what you may think going in, it does feel like a 'real' movie from beginning to end and not just an extended show. Albert Brooks once again steals the show as the Director of the EPA, though Tom Hanks does the best celebrity cameo the show has seen in ages. 'tousle my hair Mr. Hanks!'",Null,137,249,27 July 2007
