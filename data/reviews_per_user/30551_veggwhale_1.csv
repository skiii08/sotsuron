Black Swan," Overrated....another flick for.....
","another flick for people who likes mental disorders, hallucinations, lesbian action, and overrated natalie portman.its so stupid how critics would give this movie high ratings.this movie won awards? that must mean people suck these days.so in order to win awards and get high ratings...you have to be a diseased brained slut boss-student relationship and stab yourself in the end? that just proves how f*cked up the world really is.i don't care for ballet....or this movie....1 star from me.i hate critics....they are just a bunch of morons who would rate a porn movie as 5 stars because they are lonely and losers themselves. i don't care if this movie was well liked by closet perverts and predominately white people.....it still sucks.all you see these days are movies with stupid diseased people with tragic endings that don't really mean anything. stupid natalie portman can't act since the day she starred with jean reno and that stupid star wars series. vincent cassal or whoever the hell he is....always plays the role of a perverted seducer.can't believe people love crap like this.",1,6,12,4 July 2011
