Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas should be whipped.
","George sold out!  The only redeemable feature of this no-plot, no-character, poorly acted movie are the special effects.  Any movie that was 26 years in the making should be EXPONENTIALLY better than this.  George just decided to cash in.  Makes me wonder if he ever actually had any talent at all (THX, AG, and SWIV notwithstanding).  Very disappointing.",2,1,2,17 July 2000
