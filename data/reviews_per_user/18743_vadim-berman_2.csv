Blade Runner 2049," Pretentious and incoherent snoozefest
","I will go with the chorus. I am a fan of Arrival, so Villanueve in the credits piqued my attention. Boy was I disappointed.The cinematography and the settings are beautiful, but the plot and the pacing... It seems like the writers were tasked to create a script around grim, futuristic settings and Harrison Ford, and set it in slo-mo. What else?.. Things got from bad to worse, it's not all Japanese, it's now Russian for some reason mixed in with other languages which for some reason everyone understands, 'Her'-type AI, baddies without personality battle good guys without personality, and the rest is cliche-driven.Highly recommended to people with sleep disorders. I slept like a baby after enduring these 3 hours!How can it be 8 out of 10? Did the rating come from a click farm?",4,3,6,24 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," The elves went too far
","Sorry, no sale.Yes, I know it's supposed to be goofy. Yes, it's Will Ferrell. And yes, Eurovision is over the top, and so it makes sense for the movie to be over the top, too.But it doesn't work. The look of Europe is there, but the feel isn't. Iceland feels like a Disney ride. The jokes are not funny.4 stars for the vistas of Iceland, Rachel McAdams, and a few good Eurovision songs, especially Salvador Sobral. (Too bad they didn't include better acts from earlier years, as 2019 was a bit anemic. Lordi, Anouk, Harel Skaat?..)",4,13,33,27 June 2020
