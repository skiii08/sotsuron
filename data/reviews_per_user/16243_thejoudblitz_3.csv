Alien 3," The end of an epic trilogy
","Everything has been said about this movie already, but let's find out why the rating of it is so low. Here are some points of a popular reviewer, who has almost 100 percent support of their readers.1. At some points the audience is bored stiff and at other moments they are confused by the outlandish action sequences.Outlandish action? Was it too alien? And sorry you were bored by the exceptional cinematography, underlined by a pace that was just right not to rush things, which brings me the second point.2. ...a disjointed mess that feels forced and rushed.Story seemed linear to me. And which one is it, boring or rushed?3. The direction is never clear and there is no real screenplay here at all.This is just saying it was bad, without saying anything at all. How is this helpful.4. Charles Dutton is pretty good, but his character lacks the development to really make him interesting. Everyone else is just present...Dutton's character needs no development. What do you want, him finding Jesus again? Dance's backstory is interesting, and we get to know little details about everyone else like for example the IQ of one of the guards who then later unexpectedly gives his life for what he believes in, pretty strong character development for a minor player in a Sci-Fi Thriller. And that is the main problem people have when rating 'Alien³', they don't know it's not a horror film like 'Alien' and it's not an action flick like 'Aliens'.5. Overall a disappointment that is not very impressive at all. 2 stars out of 5.More bashing without sound reasoning behind it. This film is clearly underrated, and if the aforementioned reviewer had seen what we have seen in 2017, especially in the Science Fiction genre, he might even agree and change his opinion about how a 'disjointed mess' looks like.I give 10 not to up the overall score, but because 'Alien³' ends Ripley's ordeal in a stylish and original way, without insulting the intelligence of the viewer, or rehashing previous plot lines.",10,4,5,4 August 2017
A Quiet Place," Works for a normal audience, not for critical thinkers
","Almost an 8 on imdb with almost 14 hundred reviews at the point of this review written. The hype is distorting the ratings of this movie, like the script is distorting the physical laws of sound.
A creature film should not be hard to make, and the producers here had the budget, the special effects and the actors to do something interesting. Unfortunately suspending disbelief is impossible when nothing makes sense and so many questions are left unanswered.
How can a pitiful monster like that overthrow mankind? Where is the power coming from? Not a single sound trap in the whole film? Did she turn off the faucet eventually? The creatures can come and go inside the shelter without breaking anything down (which you would hear)? But the humans did not prepare silent exits in their home? What even happened?
And there is no story. The creatures come, humans make some sounds, they don't even fight, end of movie. It's like watching a boxing match with one guy weighing double the other, then last round the same guy weighs only half the other. How cheap and boring, I want to scream the screenwriter in his moronic ear.
Disappointing and anti-climatic.",4,5,9,27 June 2018
Life," Yes, okay.
","Boring characters, wasted superstars on a meaningless script, huge Alien rip-off which didn't work, an almost Marvel-style hologram on the ISS, laughable. Everything is so bad in this movie, except for the production value. We see gorgeous floating in zero-g, a sweet looking alien and easy on the eye actors. The boring story is not as boring as it would have been if the budget was low.Still, some major flaws in story-telling make this an average flick. The pretty alien does not look scary at all. The characters are not introduced properly. The whole plot is disjointed, we get the facts of the story served without any sense of purpose. Finally there is no immersion, life on the ISS is as alien as the creature without weaknesses, for which you will be rooting half-way through this film.",5,1,4,3 June 2017
