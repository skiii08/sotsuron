Marie Antoinette," Irritating music, hollow acting and terrible directing make this film a nightmare.
","The music used, (some sort of horrible trip back to new wave '80's), helped completely ruin this film. It took all credibility away from what could have, and should have been an epic film. This project was simply put in the hands of the wrong director. With such a library of interesting and important historical facts to work with, this director has thoroughly made a mess of things. Bad, hollow acting, irritating music used completely out of place, and a complete loss of oversight from the director have made this the worst film I've seen all year. What a nightmare. I simply had to stop watching after roughly 70 minutes, and wash the experience down with a cold beer.",1,11,18,18 April 2007
