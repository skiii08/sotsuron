Vertigo," Rather sloooow
","I've been reading here a lot of reviews on this. First off, to the people who enjoyed this, that is a great thing but keep in mind everyone is entitled to their opinions. To me, this movie is just flat out too slow moving. I own the DVD and will not give it up (as I intend on owning all his movies) but this is one of his very few films that bores me. James Stewart and Kim Novak both did a great job acting and Hitchcock did have some very interesting camera work going on (the zoom-in scene is amazing) but all and all, the film seemed to go nowhere and the ending couldn't have been worse. In my opinion, his best movies are The 39 Steps, The Birds, Rope, Rebecca, Shadow Of A Doubt and of course, North By Northwest.  Still, despite my negative review, if you are a Hitchcock fan like myself, its worth owning or at least worth checking out.",10,2,4,27 October 2002
Lifeboat," Underrated Hitchcock movie
","This is quite an underrated Hitchcock movie. While its not one of his best movies, this is actually quite good. The plot is very World War 2-inspired so that may be part of why it is overlooked. This does have classic Hitchcock suspense moments though (although the best one comes towards the end). A lot of dialogue here too and Tallulah Bankhead does an excellent job. Worth checking out if you are a fan.",7,4,6,31 October 2002
The Others," NOT the Sixth Sense
","Having seen The Sixth Sense before, I can assure you this is not a ripoff of that movie. First of all, The Sixth Sense was NOT the first movie to use surprise endings (see Se7en, Carnival of Souls, any Hitchcock movie). Yes, there are some similarities but overall, this a far superior movie. Nicole Kidman plays her greatest role yet as a single mother guarding her two children. Should you feel sorry for her at the ending? No, but this is a movie- should you feel sorry for Norman Bates in Psycho- no, but it still doesn't make it any less of a great movie. Having said all that, I must say that the subtle use of sounds and noises are frightening. Even having watched the film numerous times, there are still parts in this where I am startled. The only negative comment I can see is the movie is a bit slow but give it time....you won't be disappointed. The best movie of 2001.",10,0,0,31 October 2002
North by Northwest," Perfection
","This movie is perfect. I would almost like to leave it at that- a one sentence review but that wouldn't seem right. So I will just make some brief comments. Hitchcock outdoes himself on this film, Eva Marie Saint is absolutely gorgeous, Cary Grant is spectacular in this film and I don't think I have ever seen a better movie. This is a movie about Russian spies and American spies but BELIEVE me, you don't have to have a clue about spies to enjoy this movie. This is also Hitchcock's longest film (2 hours 20 minutes) but this moves so fast, you won't even notice. In fact, thats one of the greatest things about this movie is how fast it moves- there are no dull parts here. Nothing more to say- buy this NOW!",10,0,1,31 October 2002
American History X," Powerful movie
",This is probably one of the most powerful movies ever done on the subject of racism. Some material might frighten and shock people but this is because this movie shows more reality that most care to see. The black and white scenes were done very nice and both Edward Norton and Edward Furlong play their characters with perfection.,10,0,0,31 October 2002
Psycho," Everyone has seen it
","A movie that everyone has seen at one time or another. Great movie but (I might get burned for this) but a bit overrated. Don't get me wrong-  I love this movie but there are others equally deserving of attention. Anthony Perkins is outstanding as good old Norman Bates- the stuttering (also used in 1948's Rope) is an outstanding touch. The shower scene is not extremely violent but none-the-less very effective especially for that time period. In fact, one of the things I love about all Hitchcock movies is he knew what to show and what not to show (not like in today's show everything society). If you haven't seen this, go out and rent it- great film!",10,1,1,31 October 2002
A Walk to Remember," Brought me to tears
","When I first heard about this, I thought it was going to be a stupid movie (come on, it stars Mandy Moore) but I was pleasantly surprised. Compared to movies like Glitter and Crossroads, this movie is great. This is a film that has heart. Yes, some of it is quite preachy but it's something we can all relate to. We've all been picked on in high school and had our troubled times. Shand West and Mandy deliver a movie that shows you can break through from that though. I don't know if everyone will be able to relate to this movie but if you do, prepare to be in tears. Excellent.",7,0,0,31 October 2002
The Birds," This is how I got hooked
","This movie is why I got hooked on Hitchcock movies so how can I find any fault in it? Tippi Hendrin plays the beautiful Melanie Daniel's who meets bachelor Mitch Brenner in a bird shop. Here she plays a practical joke on him and in turn, he plays one back. This leads to her buying him a pair of lovebirds. She takes them to Bodega Bay and all hell breaks loose. The bird attacks are stunning, the suspense is very high in this film, the lack of music gives this whole movie a cool effect and the final scenes are breathtaking. I would recommend this for a first movie of his to watch. Prepare to be amazed.",10,0,0,31 October 2002
