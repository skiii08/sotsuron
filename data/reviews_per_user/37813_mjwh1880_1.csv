United 93," Edge of Your Seat action!!
","I expected this movie to be really sad, when actually I sat there mouth agape through the whole movie. Warning to New-bee parents. Please don't take your 4yr old son/daughter to a rated R movie. One there is language: the characters said the 'f' word about 19 times, two:there is a lot of violence. I went to a showing and some New-bee Parents took their kid. So please don't take a young child to this movie. This movie will jerk tears. The terrorists,when they realized they wont make it, the one flying the turned the plane into a nose dive. The plane turned completely upside down, and the Pennsylvanian fields got closer and closer. until the film ended.",10,3,7,28 April 2006
