The Avengers," definitely worth the watching.
","Marvel has been spending no less than five movies setting up this movie. I had my doubts, but I see the payoff. Since they've already established the main characters, there was no need to do so again. We could get right into the meat of the plot.Loki pops in from another dimension and is plotting to open a doorway that will let in a nasty bunch of aliens. BUt what really works is the chemistry between the characters here. Nick Fury breaks out his rolodex and calls the Avengers. Well, except for Thor, he just kind of shows up.What we get are some fairly effective character interaction scenes and a lot of CGI action goodness that didn't look too fake and was fairly exciting.Morton Downey Jr. is the heart of this movie, and he gets all the best lines. Tim Middelton is effective as Loki matching wits with the various characters. The other actors are good enough in their roles. Again, a movie with no less than seven superheroes was more likely to be a mess and this wasn't, so I give them their props.",10,1,5,5 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Boring, missing the point of the original
","In the ongoing tradition of Harrison Ford's Action heroes of the 1980's turning out to be really terrible dads, we have Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to 1982's Blade Runner. We meet a replicant cop named K who is of a new variety that doesn't rebel unlike those bad ones in the movies. So he tracks down a Runaway Nexus 8, even though in the original movie, we were assured that Nexus 8's only had 4 year lifespans. During the course of this, they discover the bones of Sean Young's character from the original movie, along with the realization she had given birth. Our hero also has a relationship with a Hologram Girl for some reason. I guess so he is sad when she gets deleted later in the movie. If you are watching this movie to see Harrison Ford reprise his role as Deckard, you don't get to see him walking around like someone's confused grandpa until 2 hours into an interminably long movie. (Seriously, I feel bad for Ford. Why does he do this to himself?)So they want to find the child of Deckard and Rachel because this is a replicant that can reproduce, which is supposedly more efficient than just growing them, for some reason. They say they need more replicants to colonize the outer colonies, but of course, there are plenty of people living in squalor, including a child labor sweatshop. I can't emphasize enough how long, boring, uninteresting this movie was. It's like they watched the original and still had no idea what made it a good movie.",1,169,324,8 October 2017
Angels & Demons," Dead Bishop in the Lobby!
","'Well, I don't know who keeps leaving them!' Sorry, just recalled that old Monty Python sketch. Okay, the vibe I am getting is that for the fans of Brown's original book, Howard made a bunch of changes that they considered unacceptable. Fair enough, I guess, but honestly, a book is always going to be better than the movie. Also, Brown got so many things wrong in the book about Catholicism that the film makers probably did him a favor by making changes.Beyond that, it's a well paced film, good performance by Hanks. I think it telegraphed it's suspense a bit early when you found out the Ewan McGregor character was the mastermind behind all the mystery. Yeah, that was about as predictable as Scooby Doo. 'It was old man Carmalengo all along!' 'And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling Symbologists!' Catholic groups were upset with their church being mocked, but the book was much harsher than the movie and the church deserves a lot of criticism...",Null,1,2,27 November 2009
Changeling," A powerful movie
","The sad thing is that writers never get enough credit for their role in a movie. If it weren't for the writer, actors and directors would be standing about waiting for divine inspiration as to what to do. This movie was written by J. Michael Strazcynski, best known as the writer/producer of the Sci-Fi series Babylon 5. YOu can see a few echoes of dialog he used in B5, such as when Angelina's character announces 'Never start a fight, but always finish one.' This is not easy material to watch. A child vanishes, and an inept LAPD returns the wrong child. Rather than just admit their mistake, they commit the mother to an insane asylum where she is tortured in an attempt to get her to recant her complaint. Sadly, this is a true story, and for those nostalgic about the 'good old days', they weren't nearly as good as we like to think they were. even though she prevails in her quest to right the wrong the LAPD did, she still doesn't find her son. The film does a fine job of recreating 1928 Los Angeles, from the chaotic switchboard room to the streets to the skyline. JMS has always like writing strong female characters, and he doesn't disappoint here. Jolie's solid performance in this film erases the fluffy nonsense most of her career is comprised of. John Malkovich is strong in a role as a crusading clergyman. (A positive portrayal of the Clergy in Hollywood. Who would have thought so?)",10,3,4,1 March 2009
Men in Black 3," The Sequel they should have made the first time
","The good things I will say about this movie. It wasn't geared towards a child audience watching the cartoon show. Frank the Pug is gone and the Worms only have a brief appearance. Also gone is Agent Zed, as the actor playing him got a mess of legal trouble. The movie begins with his funeral.So the criminal Boris the Animal escapes from the Lunar prison, and finds a time machine which allows him to alter the time-line so he returns to his race and kills Agent K. But only Agent J remembers the correct time-line. He goes back into time to correct things, and we get a young agent K played by Josh Brolin.Some predictable plot twists, such as the colonel turns out to be J's father.They also had the fun parts with the 5th Dimensional Alien who can see all possible futures.Some stuff that didn't make sense. If K deployed the ARC net in 1969 and that killed all the bad aliens, then why did it take another 40 years for them to arrive? So it's a fun movie, kind of gets the franchise back on track.",8,1,4,7 March 2013
Frost_Nixon," Let me make this perfectly clear
","Oddly, it's the signature Nixon line, and Langella's Nixon doesn't say it once...I really did believe that Langella was Nixon. Rarely does an actor pull of a transformation so effectively that you can no longer see the actor but the character he portrays. A man in political exile, who believes that he had done the right things when in office, but comes to the realization at the end that he profoundly failed.Of course, the movies flaw, if it has one, is that it makes Frost out to be this great interviewer who elicited a long awaited 'confession' from Nixon. The reality is that Nixon wanted to make the statement he did for the record, and his staff carefully negotiated the terms of that confession.As high drama, though, it is very good.",Null,0,2,25 April 2009
Alien 3," How they should have ended the series...
","Leaving the Aliens and Ripley with some dignity.The plot is that on their way home from the last movie, two alien facehuggers crash the ship from the last movie, killing everyone on board except Sigourny, who was finally getting a decent payday out of one of these. They land on a prison planet inhabited by a bunch of convicts who found religion.Meanwhile, one of the aliens is slowly picking people off while another grows inside Ripley.We have some overwrought chase scenes, and the movie is made more confusing by the plot devise that the planet is lice-infested and everyone has to shave their heads. Which means all the characters kind of look the same and they have very little individual personality. I think Ripley was the one with the breasts.Special guest start. Paul McGann (Doctor Who #8) as one of the convicts. YOu won't recognize him. He's in a bit role even though he gets something like fourth or fifth billing.",6,0,1,12 February 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Actually better than the last one...
","Although that would be damning with faint praise.Clearly, the screenwriters this time had actually READ something by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, so I give them credit for getting characters right to a degree.And we have Noomi Rapace, who is in everything nowadays. Hope she's a fad which wears off soon.It was better than the last one, absolutely. They had a few pointless action scenes, and some telegraphing, like Holmes giving Watson that adrenal shot, you knew that would be used later.Downey was better as Holmes this time and Law was more believable as Watson, but frankly, there was only just enough characterization to hand the action scenes on, which were forgettable.",5,4,6,16 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Things best left unseen
","The original trilogy was the attempt to give us the backstory of how Darth Vader became Darth Vader, but at the end of the day, you kind of don't care. So you have this convoluted plot where Darth Sideous/Senator Palpatine/the future Emperor is attempting to manipulate a trade dispute so he can become Chancellor. The Jedis are involved, somehow, as guardians of peace, but they don't actually do anything and apparently this Republic exists without any kind of real military force to enforce their will, so planets can go to war with each other and there isn't squat anyone can do about it, really. Okay, here's the problem. Who cares? The plot seems to be a series of excuses to hang special effects sequences on. In many ways, Star Wars has been hoist on its own petard. The damage it did was that it put special effects above writing and character development, merchandising above storytelling, but now everyone is doing that, so what's all that special? Oh, yeah, and Jar-Jar Binks. A problem I think is that everyone bemoans the fall of the REpublic, but no one seems to care one way or the other. One side uses mindless drones and the other side uses mindless clones... so who honestly cares?",3,4,9,10 August 2010
Sucker Punch," A film lobotomy
","Truly, instead of using a pick to lobotomize the main character, they should have just made her watch this film ten times.Words cannot describe the mind-numbing awfulness of this film, but I'll start. A girl is put into an insane asylum by her father trying to get her money. As she waits to be lobotomized, she has a fantasy of being stuck in a strip-club/brothel where no one actually has sex or takes off their clothing. She conspires with the other inmates/dancers in an elaborate escape plan dragging them into fantasy scenarios where they are fighting dragons, zombies, giants and other seizure inducing CGI crap.After the minority characters are killed for plot simplicity, we are dragged back into the real world with the lobotomy scene... Or something.",1,6,13,10 July 2011
Marie Antoinette," A historical Bomb!
","There is an old joke about bad casting in historical movies. They said if they ever cast Jerry Lewis to play Abe Lincoln, the audience would be ready to shoot him by the time he got to Ford's Theatre. Well, if Kirstin Dunst's Marie Antoinette ever got the to Guilotine, I suspect the audience would have been ready to pull the string. I can only assume Sophia 'My Daddy is a big-time director and producer' Coppola realized this, and didn't take the movie to that logical conclusion.It is possible to do good movies about this time period. Amadeus and The Madness of King George come immediately to mind. This is not one of those films.Let's start with the music. Yes, Music is usually a secondary consideration for movies like this, but this producer decided to score this movie with a contemporary rock score, which made absolutely no sense at all. Some of the music was truly awful. Why not use a period score for this movie? This was the Age of Mozart, after all, and they couldn't find good period music to score this film with? Second, here you have a movie which is about a pretty important period in history, and about people who were very key in that history, and they seem more like bystanders than participants.Instead, what we get is something that looks like 'E Channel, 18th Century Paris', where inordinate amounts of time are shown as to what the nobility of Paris ate, wore, and the customs of the court. I felt full after the 20th pastry, thank you! Not enough bad things can be said about the casting, which included a horribly miscast Ms. Dunst, and Rip Torn as Louis XV.Just a mess of a movie. I hear even the French booed, and they think Jerry Lewis is funny!",3,1,6,25 February 2007
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?
","I just have to wonder what kind of thought process went on in Hollywood where anyone thought this was a good idea.Technically, it's a masterfully crafted film. The dialog is kind of sharp, the plot moves along, the special effects are seamless into the film (although the final sequence is WAAAAAAY over the top.) But the real offense of this movie is that it take probably one of history's greatest figures, and turns him into a cheap action figure. Why not 'Ghandi, Zombie Slayer' or 'Martin Luther King: Werewolf Killer!' Because those WOULD be offensive. Lincoln is sufficiently remote where you can do a mashup between the real man and a cheap action hero, and no one gets nearly as offended as they should.The Confederacy was evil because it held on to the notion that one person owning another was acceptable when everyone realized it wasn't. You don't need some silly nonsense about vampires in there.On a side note, the vampires themselves are cartoonish. I mean, I guess we can be glad they are portraying them as monsters after their emasculation by movies like Twilight.",3,0,3,4 November 2012
Star Trek," Better than I expected.
","I really went into Star Trek, not wanting to like it. However, to give the devil his due, Abrams really did capture the essence of the characters, and even expands on some of them. There's not a lot new here. We have time travel, we have a ranting Khan-like villain. We have the obligatory red shirt buying it. The characters do the things we expect them to do. In many ways, this is a 'the crew comes together film' that the Original Series never had but all four sequel series inflicted upon us. Let's evaluate the characters- Chris Pine as Kirk. Actually, a pretty solid performance. He comes off as this rebellious guy who wins because he doesn't always play by the rules. He does the unexpected, he takes chances. You really believe he's a young Shatner. Quinto as Spock- He actually had me convinced he was a younger Leonard Nimoy. (And the two actors together fit almost seamlessly.) He really recreates the mystique of Nimoy's original presentation and all the faux-Vulcans we've seen in subsequent series lacked. Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy. He's actually pretty decent. If there's a fault, it's that we don't see more of him. Simon Pegg as Scotty - Pegg is a great comic actor, and he brings that comic frustration to his version of Scotty. The gal who played Uhura – Really pretty, they give her more depth and personality than she ever had in the series (as Spock's love interest, no less!) They make her a linguist, which gives her more to do than 'Hailing Frequencie Open.' Bruce Davison as Christopher Pike- I hope that Admiral Pike appears in the sequels, I really like his character. Now the ones that don't work so well- the guys who played Sulu and Chekov. Their characters were always interchangeable on the series, and here they were largely dispensable. Eric Bana as Nero I think in some ways he's channeling Ricardo Montalban, but you never get the feeling he's into it. SPOILER - There are things I didn't like, such as destroying Vulcan (and wiping out most Vulcans) and creating a separate time line where presumably, most of the Original Series, Next Generation and Deep Space Nine never happened. (On the brighter side, neither did Voyager! Enterprise appears to be part of the continuum, though!) I think Abrams felt he needed to up the ante, but I think he went to far on that plot point. Some things are over the top. This new Enterprise is HUGE judging by the sets (which strikes me as impractical) and the Romulan Ship even bigger. (Seriously, why would a mining barge be armed like a dreadnought?) I think it suffers from Blockbuster Syndrome, where they do all these things that really shock and awe on the big screen, but won't look nearly as impressive the third time you've seen it on DVD. Heroic or not, promoting Kirk from Cadet to Captain at the end? That seems, well, improbable.",8,5,15,8 May 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Episode III-1/2 The story you never wanted to see, for a reason.
","Spoiler alert... they get the plans! If this was a story where they took out all the Star Wars elements and just made them generic Sci-Fi items, you wouldn't care. You might even feel a bit disappointed. And can we talk about 'Uncanny Valley Tarkin'? They used CGI to reproduce the late, great Peter Cushing from the first Star Wars movie, and he just looks creepy. (They also do a similar effect at the end with Carrie Fisher, which is equally creepy and not just because she died around the time this film was released.) So a character we don't care about gets involved in a plot to steal the Death Star plans, and the heck with continuity from the original Trilogy. Except the Death Star is already flying around blowing stuff up. Also, they make this movie a lot grittier and more violent, and yes, all the characters die at the end, even the ones introduced to make the movie more popular in China. Heck, I'm taking off another star for that one. Now, because Disney sees these movies as a way to rake in cash, we are going to get these 'Stand Alone' stories between chapters of the new trilogy for years, I guess. But they really shouldn't.",2,0,3,15 December 2017
Iron Man 2," Not as Good as the first
","But still enjoyable.The plot line is that Iron Man has brought world peace and security, but the US Government wants the suit. Meanwhile, Tony Stark is slowly dying from palladium cores in the ARC generator that powers the suit and keeps him alive.Meanwhile in Russia, Ivan Vanko designs a version of the Iron Man suit based on plans his father gave him. After a showdown with Stark in Monaco, he is recruited by rival industrialist Justin Hammer to make more suits.So why does this movie kind of work? Well, it's largely faithful to the mythos. Fans get to see the characters that have been part of the Iron Man storyline. Downey is once again great in the role of Iron Man, probably because you can see this guy as someone who gets into trouble.The movie does drag in places, and probably could have benefited from some tighter editing. Beyond that, well worth watching.",8,0,4,31 October 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Mixed feelings about this film.
","How can so many good people be involved in such a train wreck? This had a lot of good actors in it. Sigourney is back, they have Winona Ryder, Gary Dourdan, Brad Douriff, and even Ron Perleman is properly cast for a change. The writer is Josh Whedon, who would later go on to delight us with Firefly.Side note. Notice how the crew of the Betty seems to be rough drafts of the Serenity Crew? You have the sweet girl with a secret, the tough guy who hurts people and the warrior babe. Throw in a preacher and a prostitute, and it would have been feeling like old times. So anyway, through the magic of cloning an a co-producer credit for Sigourney, Ellen Ripley is back from the dead. Except this time, they kind of got the alien and human DNA mixed up. So Ripley has alien acid blood and the alien Queen has a womb.I really think the problem is in the direction. You have this French director who managed to screw everything up, because he didn't realize he was directing an American film. The first time I realized something was wrong was when the Dan Hedaya character gets a crazy look on his face when they explain to him that the Ripley Clone might have memories.There are a lot of other scenes in the film that just seem odd or out of place.Whedon's script is actually pretty decent, if it was better directed and they didn't make some of the acting choices they made. The real problem, though, it the aliens themselves. There's nothing really new about them. they're doing the same thing they've been doing for the last three movies. Who cares anymore?",5,0,1,30 January 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," The Re-Wrath of Khan!
","Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was the best of the movies. Nearly every film since then has tried to recreate the formula with a similar scenery-chewing villain, and this film decides, what the heck, let's just bring back Khan.Does it work? Kind of. I found myself intermittently being touched by the nice nods to the classics of Trek and then rolling my eyes at some of the corniness and over the top action scenes.SPOILERS- After a series of terrorists attacks on Star Fleet, Kirk and company are sent to the Klingon home world to hunt down the perpetrator, whom they are told is a renegade Star Fleet office but is in fact Khan. Seems he was resurrected by a renegade admiral who wanted to use his knowledge to prepare for war with the Klingons.They have some subtle commentary on the war on terror and the ends justifying the means. Mostly, though, it's enough plot to hang an okay action movie on. Peter Weller does a great job in his role. The machinations between Kirk and Admiral Marcus and Khan are pretty good.Good stuff? Carol Marcus, a Tribble, Klingons, a ship they seized from Harry Mudd, Section 31, and so much more from a Trek Nerd's wish list.Also, have to say a lot of good things about the characters here. They all disappear into their roles fairly easily, with maybe the exception of Pine, who simply is not invoking Shatner just yet. Karl Urban is great as McCoy, but he's completely underutilized. Quinto is becoming a convincing Spock.The more dubious stuff. The action scenes are a bit much, to the point of eliminating my suspension of disbelief. This is the kind of cartoonish stuff the Star Wars Prequels did. They spent a lot of money on this, and frankly, STII:TWOK got the same emotional impact with cheap sets on a movie they originally planned as a made for TV operation.The actor who played Khan... just didn't work for me. Ricardo Montalban did it a lot better. The Deus Ex Machina they use at the end to save a major character is telegraphed so obviously there's no tension, and after they spend a lot of time creating a thematic bridge between this and the climax of TWOK.Worth watching. Yes.",8,6,16,17 May 2013
Public Enemies," Flawed history
","A little background before I go on. I used to vacation in the little town of Manitowish Waters, where the Little Bohemia lodge is located. A key part of this movie is centered in the Little Bohemia shootout. (The scenes in the movie were actually filmed there!) The prelude is that Melvin Purvis tortures a mortally wounded Dillenger confederate for the location of his hideout. In reality, the wife of owner Emil Wannatka mailed a letter to the FBI ratting out the gangsters. Now, I realize that this scene was done for dramatic effect, but what was the effect here? The whole movie seems to reflect on modern complaints that liberal Hollywood seems to have with the Government- there is wiretapping, officials (mostly J. Edgar Hoover) abusing authority, torture of suspects, etc.Now, I give them credit for actually using the actual site and calling the town 'Manitowish'. (In reality, the town of Manitowish is about six miles north. Manitowish Waters was at that time known as 'the Town of Spider Lake' until the town fathers realized in the 1940's that wasn't the best name to get tourists visiting.) The history gets sloppier with the actual shootout. In the historical version, all the gangsters got away, a G-man was shot by Baby-Face Nelson on a nearby road, but it was a complete fiasco for the FBI. In the movie, all of Dillengers' accomplices are killed, including Nelson. (Nelson, in fact, survived Dillenger by a few months). Pretty Boy Floyd was also killed in the first scenes of the movie, even though he, too, was killed after Dillenger.Dillenger was the first string Gangster. These guys were kind of the number two and three guys.I think the producers figured that modern audiences wouldn't go for an accurate portrayal of events, and wanted to see as much ordnance as John McClain or John Rambo would dish out.But the biggest flaw in the movie is that I didn't care about Dillenger or any other character as a person. I could have cared less if the FBI caught him or not. (Of course, knowing the did kind of took the suspense out of it for me. )A final note. DIllenger and his sort get glorified in movies when there is economic trouble. THey robbed the banks, and people hated the banks in the 1930's and hated them in the 1970's when movies glorifying these people were made. The fact this sort of movie makes a comeback now says a lot.",Null,0,2,25 December 2009
Elizabeth," it was okay...
","It really didn't get anything horribly wrong as a history movie, which is always a plus.But it was very slow moving as a film, and you never really got the passions of the characters and sometimes you had to work to figure out who was who. The BBC miniseries was far better.Funny moment. Christopher Eccelston (Doctor Who#9) plays the 4th Duke of Norfolk , grandson of the 3rd Duke of Norfolk, who was played by Patrick Troughton (Dr. Who #2) in the BBC's 'Six Wives of Henry VIII'. I guess two things you are going to end up doing as a British Actor. Period costume pieces and Doctor Who. I guess he regenerated! Anyway, back to passions. You never get any here. There's this big fight over whether England is going to be Protestant or Catholic, but you never get the impression it's something anyone cares about, other than which team they are on.The performances are serviceable. But there's nothing really memorable about this film, and if you know the history, there isn't a real lot of suspense.",4,0,3,19 May 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," You got Video Game in my movie!
","You got movie in my video Game! Unlike Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, the two things are not great together! Okay, well, we get the predictable plot that holds together the action sequences, and did anyone doubt that Sir Ben Kingsley wasn't going to be the bad guy the minute we knew he was in this movie...'Dammit, I played GHandi! I won an Oscar! I don't need to be doing this Video-Game Crap!' Has some fun action sequences and characters who have been so 'Disneyed' down we don't care about them... Seriously, Disney, would it kill you to have the hot babe leading lady show a little leg?The characters are all from 'Cliche's R Us'. Of course, the noble knife thrower would side with the Prince. And the Princess would fall in love with him and all the other stuff you expect to happen in a video game if you found the cheats...A point on the plot. Besides the fact it has a less than subtle political metaphor - a war started on the premise of weapons that didn't exist. Was Ben Kingsley playing Ancient Dick Cheney? On top of that, it didn't make any sense. If the master plan was to get the dagger to plunge into the sands of time, why go through this whole rigamaroll of killing the king if your plan was to go back in time and kill him anyway? Why not just get the Hassansins to steal the dagger for you, and then infiltrate the city yourself when no one was watching. Why do a war and a whole complicated kill the king and frame his son who happens to have the one thing you need to make your plot work?",5,0,1,21 September 2010
Batman Returns," Tim Burton can't help himself
","The problem with Tim Burton is that he lives in his own little universe where the rest of us wouldn't even want to visit.It's not that the man hasn't done some good films. 'Beetlejuice', 'Ed Wood' and even the first 'Batman' film were actually all pretty decent outings. It's when he's left on his own to indulge his inner weirdo that we get some pretty funky results.All Burton/Schumacher Batman films can be divided into a checklist. 'How I became a Supervillian' Check. 'Batman goes into elaborate costume change sequence' Check. 'Supervillian shoots his own minion' Check. 'Big overdrawn battle with bad buy at end.' Check.Danny Devito seemed like a good choice to play the Penguin because of the similar body types. (Short, pudgy.) But the characters are completely different. The Penguin was a sophisticated, Gentleman bandit. Devito has made his career playing, rude, crude obnoxious characters. Loading him down in a ton of makeup didn't help.Michelle Pfeiffer might have been the stuff of a hundred lesbian fantasies until Haley Berre did the same role some time later, but as a character, she was kind of shallow.And replacing the kind of grim comic book Gotham of the first movie with the weird fantasy of this one further disconnected it...",3,3,10,23 November 2009

After joining a secret ops squad lead by William Stryker, Logan quits the team to become a lumberjack in Northern Canada ('Ohhh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm o-kay!')He meets up with Silverfox, who amazingly is a Native American woman with a blonde sister.

Actions sequences that go on forever eventually desensitize the viewer. Is any of this getting through, Hollywood. Halfway through the climatic battle, I just didn't care who won.I say this, because I wonder if we are going to get to a point where movies are just this kind of eye candy, and we won't even need 'actors' anymore because everything will be CGI.Since I need to actually come up with ten lines of text, I will just say that in the end, this movie barely deserved ten lines of text.",5,1,2,5 December 2007

Godzilla's ugly brother shows up in downtown Manhatten and starts reeking havoc. A group of people at a party make their way back into the city to rescue the lead character's girlfriend. We have splices of happier times split into the film. After getting some of his friends killed in terrible ways, the main character and his girlfriend are hiding under a bridge right before the monster gets nuked. Amazingly, the film in the camera survives because JJ Abrams is too much of an idiot to understand concepts like 'Electromagnetic pulse'. (Wow, and this moron is going to write the next Star Trek Film. Nice knowing you, Star Trek Franchise!) I guess I also didn't like it because some of the scenes were too reminiscent of 9/11.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The saga ended...
","weakly.This film has its good moments, but in many ways, it seems to be an attempt to tie up all the loose plot threads as neatly as possible.Overall, the notion is that Darth Vader redeems himself by turning on the emperor. Except we never really understand why because we never really understand why a supposedly good man (as Luke describes him) would support the emperor to start with.Conversely, we can't really respect Obi-Wan and Yoda. They are essentially setting this kid up to kill his father.Oh, yeah, and Ewoks. Did we really need the Ewoks? I mean, they were like little cannibalistic teddy bears? Were they serving Imperial Stormtroopers at that party at the end?In many ways, I think the Star Wars universe has deep philosophical implications that are hinted at and never explored. Maybe because unlike Star Trek, the thing was always too busy selling action figures.",Null,2,4,27 November 2010
Megamind," Fun stab at the Genre
","This movie gets about as close to plagiarizing characters as you can get.So the story is about a supervillian with a relationship with a hero that looks entirely too much like Superman and Lex Luthor. After the villain causes the hero's (apparent) demise, he starts up a relationship with the Lois Lane like love interest of the hero using a holographic projection, and realizes what he really needs is a hero to challenge him.Unfortunately, he picks the entire wrong guy, a nerdy cameraman with issues of his own.What sells this movie are the characterizations by the voice actors combined with the fun animation, especially Will Ferrel as 'MegaMind' and Tina Fey as Roxanne. (Who I think is also the name of the love interest in 'Cyrano'? Coincidence? I think not.) Brad Pitt is fun as the Hero in the few 'cameo' scenes he has.",9,0,0,8 March 2011
Underworld Awakening," Pointless
","A lot of CGI eye candy with no plot.The concept is that humans have figured out that the Vampires Covens and Lycans exist (as if though they could have missed all the destruction in the first two movies) and proceed to hunt them down.The Kate Beckensell character then proceeds to get captured while the male lead didn't come back. And you have more obligatory fights between CGI werewolves and vampires and yawn, I think I don't care.And after four movies, that gray-scale lighting is getting a bit tired, don't you think.I guess there was like this Scooby-doo plot when you find out the Lycans were behind Antigen all along and that was supposed to be a surprise or something.",3,4,8,13 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Like the Third Car in a Three Car Pileup
","Star Wars, the Rise of Skywalker. Hopefully the last Star Wars Movie.How did Disney's Billion Dollar investment go so horribly wrong?So really, you have to start with how the first two 'Sequel' movies messed everything up. The Force Awakens decided to essentially undo all the happy ending aspects of the Original Trilogy to set up the new Trilogy. This is really where it all went wrong because it rendered the OT meaningless. Luke gives up, Leia and Han don't stick together and their Emo kid goes bad. The Empire comes back in the form of the 'New Order' and heck, they're even building a new Death Star because the first two worked out so well.Then you get The Last Jedi, where Rian Johnson decided to stick a big old thumb in the eye of the hardcore fan base. They decide to tell us the force is nothing special, and engage in an absolutely silly plan that gets most of the rebels killed. And they waste about half the film with Fin hanging out with the human equivalent of nails on a chalkboard, Rose Tico. Oh, were you waiting for Snoke to be a big deal? Nope, they kill him off without telling us anything about him and where he came from. Fans hated it, complained about it and even organized a boycott of the next Stand-alone film, Solo.JJ Abrams was brought back to fix the mess, and just ended up making a bigger mess... kind of like the third car in a three-car pileup.So, let's start with the silliness of it all. Turns out Emperor Sheev Palpatine/Darth Sideous isn't quite as dead as we thought he was. (Monty Python voice 'I'm not quite dead. I'm getting better!') Yes, despite being thrown down a ten-mile chasm into a reactor on a station that then blew up, he's apparently alive and well on the Sith Planet, where he's building a new fleet that he wants to give Darth Emo.... I'm sorry, Kylo Ren. All he has to do is find Rey. Maybe he cloned himself. Maybe Snoke was something he grew in a lab. Whatever.What we get is a convoluted chase sequence to find a dagger to find a Wayfinder to find the lost planet of the Sith that he's hiding on. Except they have to go on another couple of side quests to reprogram C3PO and rescue Chewbacca. This leads to a massive reveal at the end where Kylo and Rey fight a resurrected Palpatine and Kylo redeems himself before dying... um, wait, isn't this all terribly familiar? Don't worry about spoilers, kids, if you've seen past Star Wars movies, you've seen this one.And this is the problem, I think with a franchise like this. Whether it be Doctor Who, Star Trek or Star Wars, you have to strike this fine balance between Fan Service and innovation. To much fan service, and you just get something that looks retreaded. Too much innovation, you risk making the fans upset that you are marring up their childhood memories.Johnson went too far in 'innovation' with Jedi. Abrams is going too far with 'Fan Service, trying his very best to erase everything Johnson did to cheese off the fans. In the process, he made a movie where every story beat was kind of predictable.All that said, let's look at some of the characters, and how they messed them up. It's a pity, most of the actors are likable enough, and they are reading the awful dialog as best they can.
First, Princess/General Leia Organa... which has a problem in that Carrie Fisher died before filming started. Invoking the spirit of Ed Wood, they took some clips off the cutting room floor, used the Dark Arts and CGI and inserted her into parts of the movie. While not as unsettling as the insertion of the late Peter Cushing into Rogue one, they really don't work that well.Lando's back... because they ran out of other characters that they haven't killed off yet. Luke and Han's ghosts show up to tell our heroes to not be as tired of this stuff as we are.Then we have Rey. This is her story, mostly. The complaint about her is that she's a Mary Sue, being perfect in every way. We have a montage of her Jedi-Training at the beginning of this one, which really should have happened two movies ago. Why does she need to train, she can do stuff we never saw other Jedis do? Literally. Like the new Jedi Healing Power- Nothing like pulling new powers out of your backside to make a story work. (Oddly, this magic power also appears in the Mandolorian.)Oh, yeah (Spoilers), and we find out that Rey is Palpatine's Granddaughter. Didn't even know Palpy had a son or was even into chicks, but apparently, he was.Kylo Ren/AKA Ben Solo/ Aka Darth Emo. - Well, wow, big surprise, this movie is about how he redeems himself, even getting a visit from Ghost Dad to say that he forgives him for the whole murder thing. Ugh.Fans will be happy to see much, much less of Rose Tico. It's like they realized the fans hated her with Jar-Jar Binks levels of contempt and decided to not use her that much. They did introduce two new female characters so we know that Fin and Poe have a case of the Not-Gays. I'm so bored with it I'm not even going to bother looking up the names of these characters.The whole ending involves them leading an attack on Palpatine's new fleet of Star Destroyers all equipped with Planet Killing Weapons because you can't have a Star Wars movie without planet-killing weapons. How these ships got built, who was crewing them... ah, who cares, it just means the First Order will have 100 times more ships and can conquer all the free people of the Galaxy who couldn't be bothered fighting them up until this point.A major plot line involves going to a planet to find someone who will reprogram C3PO so he can read Sith writing on a dagger. Somehow, it is against his programming to read Sith. A bunch of problems with this.The first one being, he was built by Anikan Skywalker out of parts. So where would this program come from if the Sith had been gone for 1000 years at that point. Second- they say this reprogramming would completely erase his memory. This is essentially erasing him as a person, and it leads to some silly comedy where he's wandering around battles not knowing who anyone is or what is going on.This has kind of always been one of my complaints about the Star Wars universe. Droids are obviously self-aware. They have personalities, make decisions, form friendships, but they can STILL be treated like, well, machines.",3,4,15,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Just not that good.
","This movie is really a treat for the eyes, and maybe all the flash and bang helps you ignore the HUGE plot flaws.Long and short- You have this Galactic Republic where the government kind of ceases to work due to all the bureaucracy. On one side, you have separatists who want out of the Republic, but few of them want to fight to do it, so they build millions of robots. The systems that want to stay in the REpublic aren't all that keen to do the fighting, either, so they need an army of clones to do their dirty work, lead by Jedi who aren't all that interested in what the fight is about. they are busy looking for a whole TWO Sith dudes, one hiding right under their noses.Oh, wait, this has a love story. That you don't buy for a minute. Honestly, I was kind of creeped out by Anakin, and I couldn't imagine his pining for fascism or genocide was a real turn on for Padme...Give me the original trilogy, which at least felt a need to develop character and story, and not see them as a place to hand special effects.The underlying flaw of prequels is that the character's backstory is best left to the imagination. Darth Vader was vastly more interesting in the way he was remembered in the earlier films. When you actually show him as a petulant teen with hormone issues, he becomes a lot less interesting.",4,1,3,30 August 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," A solid entry
","I really hope the Avengers movie is worth it, as they've been setting it up over five movies now.This one is more blatant than the others, as it ties in both elements of the Iron Man movies and Thor.Still, it has what you expect in a Captain America movie. Weakling agrees to radical experiment so he can fight in World War II, becomes a superhero. Can't complain, it had what you expected.So the elements you'd expect in a movie like this.Chris Evans as Captain America- He's pretty solid, the character has depth and is likable. There were a couple of minutes where I thought they might do another 'Superhero with Daddy Issues' when we heard his father died in World War I, but they didn't dwell on them. (Seriously, are you going to call the new hero group 'The Avengers' or 'Why didn't you love me?'Bucky Barnes is here, too, but he's an adult. Pre-Teen sidekicks were all the rage in Golden Age comics, but there's just something creepy about child endangerment. So Bucky is an adult contemporary before he gets whacked.And we have the Howling Commandos... why not.The guy who steals the movie is Tommy Lee Jones. I'm almost ready to forgive him for messing up Two-Face in 'Batman Forever'.The whole movie takes place in a sanitized, romanticized version of World War II. And it looks great.The female lead was great, and the guy who played Howard Stark was believable as the father of the Robert Downey character in the Iron Man movies.But no superhero movie is really complete without a villain, is it? In this one, we have The Red Skull. Pretty close to what you expect from the comics, and one of the more effective antagonists we've seen in these movies. So overall, a good movie, fun to watch, let's move on to the Avengers.",Null,1,3,2 November 2011
Oblivion," about Average
","The plot line of this film is that a couple of technicians are overseeing the removal of the last of the water on Earth after a war with some aliens. Except the Aliens are people and the technicians are clones and you pretty much have to put your brain on hold to wait for the few scenes of exposition between the action scenes.So you have Tom Cruise still playing the young heartthrob at 50-something while his co-stars are in their 20s.The problem I had with the plot is that if Tom and his girlfriend are clones, there's really no good reason for the alien machine to convince them they are people. Why not just program them to do whatever you want them to do?",5,1,5,24 August 2014
The Last Legion," So many historical inaccuracies....so many... head imploding
","Okay, this wasn't a bad film, unless you are a history major, and you scream at Romulus Augustus living in 460 AD (He hadn't even been born yet) or Roman legions still using certain tactics or Romulus Augustus tracing his line back to Caesar... or that they were still pagans when the Empire had long before converted to Christianity...Or that there still was a Roman presence in Britiania (there wasn't by 460). Oh, well, try to have a good time, anyway. Some of the battle scenes are cool if somewhat predictable. The Indian warrior babe was kind of hot to watch,a nd you can see Dr. Bashir from Deep Space Nine get killed, which is kind of fun.",4,3,6,30 December 2007
Watchmen," An incredibly loyal adaptation
","When watching a film based on a popular book or graphic novel, there is always the expectation of how closely the producers will follow the source material. Too closely, it might not be accessible to non-fans. Not closely enough, and the loyal fans will crowd onto websites like this one and scream bloody murder.The producers decided (rightfully) to stick close to the original except for one minor plot alteration at the end (which I will discuss later.) They were very loyal to the characters and their motivations, probably only leaving things out if there wasn't time to work them in (and I suspect that many of them will be in future director cuts or special features on the DVD.) This is a long movie. 162 minutes. Factor in previews, you are going to have about three hours.If I have any quibble, it is that some of the violence and sex was even more over the top than Moore and Gibbon's original work. The heroes don't just beat up criminals, they kill them. (Only Rorschach did in the original novel). Even Dr. Manhatten's nudity is less subtle than the comic book. This thing has and deserves an 'R' rating, so don't be fooled into bringing your kids because this is a comic book movie, you'll be answering a lot of questions afterwards you'd probably would have wanted to put off.Now, for the plot alteration... Don't read any further if you don't want to be spoiled. Okay, here you go. In the comic, Ozymandias creates a fake crisis to bring the superpowers together by fabricating fake aliens and simulating an interdimensional invasion that forces them to work together. (Mind you, this was in the 1980's, before we discovered Reagan was 'right'.) The change here is that Ozymandias simulates a fake Dr. Manhatten attack on cities around the world, making him the common enemy. I don't think it worked quite as well.Other than that, first rate acting, first rate direction, first rate CGI (not overused like some movies) etc. I can't wait for the DVD to come out!",10,1,4,7 March 2009
Man of Steel," A completely wrong way to do a Superman Movie
","Gritty movies works well for some Superheroes. Zach Snyder (Watchmen) and Christopher Nolan (the rebooted Batman) have done them. Sadly, they shouldn't have even tried here. Superman is not a gritty character. A character with nearly omnipotent powers really can't be flawed.Superman/Clark/Kal-El is played well by that guy from 'The Tudors', I guess. Some scenes he looks creepy, but even when his character is relate-able, the CGI special effects overwhelm the characterization and even the story. Kind of hard to cheer for a scenario where it ends with the NYC stand-in city undergoing destruction that makes 9/11 look like a Sunday picnic.Let's talk General Zod. Much like the new version of Khan in Star Trek, they've replaced an over the top scenery chewing with a guy who just stands and growls waiting for someone to paint in CGI behind him. And much as a Khan-pounding Spock was ludicrous, a Zod-killing Superman is equally out of place.Lois Lane? What was the point of her character, other than needing to be saved by Superman at least four times during the course of the film. None of the Comedic Foil to Clark/Love interest for Superman that the character has been for the last 80 years.A lot of interesting supporting characters. Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Russel Crowe as Jor-El. All fine actors doing good work with their characters. A special shout-out to Christopher Meloni as the military guy. (Betcha he's really sorry he left L&O:SVU for this nonsense, though.) At the risk of sounding like an old person, this CGI nonsense where they can create these awesome looking scenes, around characters that simply don't engage me, just don't work. Give me a mid-budget movie made with some heart and characterizations any day of the week. Never a big fan of the Donner Superman movies, they the were way ahead of this nonsense.",3,3,7,23 December 2013
"I, Robot"," Here's the exchange i would like to have heard....
","Del - 'You are the dumbest smart person I've ever met.'Calvin- 'Well,I had a brain, but they lost it in the re-writes.'I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization of Asimov's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed. In the books, she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists, able to think her way through a problem. Here she's just a damsel in distress, waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith.There are passing references to Asimov's Laws of Robotics, but they are an afterthought to the CGI and action scenes.Smith is likable, as he is in most of his films, but honestly, the story isn't that good. YOu figure it out long before these genius characters do.",2,15,25,3 February 2009
Ender's Game," Well made garbage
","Technically this movie looks great, and even some of the performances weren't' that bad.Of course, the problem was that it relied on Orson Card's dreadfully turgid prose for its main plot, and being that there are enough loyalists out there, they really couldn't deviate far from it.So what you have is a movie that drags on for an hour and a half about the training, and all of 10 minutes about the war.Making matters worse, of course, is that somehow they got Harrison Ford to phone in his line. EVery line he speaks in the movie is done with this flat affect like he doesn't even care about the movie he is in.Thankfully, this movie flopped horribly and we won't be seeing any of Card's even more tedious sequels made into films.",1,21,36,14 June 2014
Monsters vs. Aliens," A fun movie
","Not a big fan of Dreamworks animation, but this was a fun movie.The plot is that a girl named Susan is hit by a meteor on her wedding day that transforms her into a giant. (Reminscent of the '50 Foot Woman' and 'The Amazing Collosal Man' both of which have homages in the film.) She is locked up with a bunch of equally not-quite-infringing-on-someone-else's-copyrighted characters, including a gill man called 'The Missing Link (Obviously, the Creature from the Black Lagoon) Insectosaurus (Toho's Mosura), Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D (The Fly) and the gelatinous B.O.B. (The Blob). Of course, despite the patasches, none of these monsters are in the least bit as scary as their 1950's counterparts, and the audience's sympathies are immediately with them.This situation is immediately put into motion when an alien robot attacks the earth in search of the element that makes Susan a giant. What follows are some fun scenes, something the kids will enjoy.",8,0,2,11 October 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Overrated
","Based on the Swedish film of the same name which I only watched half an hour of because it was so mind-numbingly boring.This one was almost as boring, and it drags on for an agonizing three hours.It doesn't help the film that the two principals don't meet until an hour and a quarter into it. It's like you are watching two movies that kind of crash into each other about halfway through, and the actions of a lot of the characters don't make a lick of sense.Daniel Craig is actually pretty good in this, not so much the female lead, who is unlikable as a character. The whole mystery plot is kind of dull. And just when you think it's over, nope, we have another 20 minutes of plot to go...",4,3,11,1 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spider-man, Spider-man, does whatever a Reboot Can!
","The Spiderman Franchise, having crashed and burned with the third movie, which had more villains than a point, is rebooted in this film. So after we've killed poor Uncle Ben again (this time played by Martin Sheen) we get about half a slow moving movie about awkward Peter Parker dealing with awkward teen stuff, and another half of the movie that is over the top, CGI overkill.The Villain De Jour is the Lizard, an otherwise kindly scientist who is driven mad by his formula in an attempt to regrow a lost arm.the movie is too disjointed, and it's not like we haven't seen his story a bunch of times before.I will give them credit for making the web-shooters a device instead of a natural ability that made no sense.",3,4,13,21 January 2013
Tropic Thunder," Best Satire since 'Network'...
","Sometimes a movie hits Satire Gold, because it points out the absolute absurdity of an industry in a way that everyone realizes how ludicrous it is except the people in the scene.The premise is that a group of actors is doing a Vietnam film (based on the only book about a true event that got a movie deal) but are totally hung up on their own egos to realize they are in deep trouble.I'm not a fan of Jack Black (who plays a drug-addicted overweight comedy star) or Ben Stiller (who I have never considered funny). I've only recently warmed up to Robert Downey Jr (who artificially makes himself look black for this role, much to the chagrin of his black co-star.) yet in this film, they work.The guy who steals the comedy is Tom Cruise, almost unrecognizable with a bald head and paunchy middle. He plays an over-the-top producer who terrorizes everyone working for him. (Some have compared him to the reprehensible Weinstein brothers, but I thought Cruise might have had Sumner Redstone in mind.) Obviously, more than a few people who are too influenced by political correctness winced at some of the jokes, but that's really their problem. The jokes ARE funny, even if society had programmed us to feel guilty about laughing at them. So have a good laugh in the privacy of your living room.",10,5,11,24 December 2008
The Duchess," Not a bad movie
","Kind of an overdrawn costume drama.The problem with most historical films or books is that they impose a modern sensibility to the character's plight. In our modern, post-feminist world, the plight of Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire, seems quite absurd. Her husband can have a mistress, openly display her in front of all to see, but if she takes a lover in secret, it is a great scandal for which she is severely penalized. To us, this seems quite unreasonable, but at the time, people dealt with it.This takes place in the period of revolution in America and France, but it seems (much like Sophia Coppola's 'Marie Antonnete', history is something that happens to other people. These folks are too busy with their own soap operas.The costumes and sets are very nice, and BBC productions have come a long way in production values since the 1970's, where shows like 'I Claudius' or 'The Wives of Henry the Eigth' were clearly shot on sound stages on the cheap. It's not the 'British Broadcasting Charity' anymore.",7,1,2,20 January 2009
Alien vs. Predator," Logic vs. Continuity
","They both lose.Okay, so after all the previous movies worrying about aliens being on Earth, it turns out that they've already been to Earth.There is an ancient pyramid buried in Antartica, and Bishop Weyland (The guy who founded Weyland-Yutani, the evil Company from the alien movies, who was also the model for the Bishop Robots)decides to mount an expedition. They in turn release a frozen alien queen, who lays a bunch of eggs that end up impregnating the expedition members in a lame, PG-13 way that insults the previous movies.Meanwhile, the Predators are coming to town. So you have some scenes where they fight, most of the characters get killed in the crossfire, and then you have the hero-babe teaming up in her tight tee-shirt (in Antartica) and helping the alien kill the queen.",2,0,2,27 November 2012
District 9," Awesome!
","This is the kind of movie that makes me a fan of science fiction. Not the kiddie laser gun shoot up, but a thoughtful film that uses Science Fiction as an allegory to examine the flaws of our own society. This film makes a compelling case against racism and corporatism (the two great evils of our age) without being overly preachy.The film starts simply enough, that a spaceship filled with a million arthropod aliens called 'Prawns' (implying they are bottom feeders) parks over South Africa (of all places) and they are immediately resettled in a place called 'District 9', essentially a huge slum. They are taken advantage of by everyone from criminals to a big corporation called MNU.Enter our hero, a corporate schlep named Wikas. He's put in charge of the relocation plan because his father-in-law runs MNU. He's not meant to be likable. In fact, he is kind of reprehensible in some ways. During the evacuation, he is exposed to an alien mutagen that begins converting him into a prawn.The kicker is the Evil Corporation (but I'd be repeating myself) figures this genetic modification allows him to operate the alien's advanced weaponry, which they are trying to crack. His father-in-law authorizes his vivisection (and you thought your in-laws were rough!) and he escapes into the alien district. He teams up with one of the smart aliens, who is trying to get the ship to return to their home world.The nice thing about this movie is (*Spoiler*) everything is not tied up neatly in a bow at the end. Things are left open ended as to the fate of both the aliens and Wikas himself. Also, the interspersed documentary style is quite neat.See this Movie!",10,2,6,16 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," That dirty little Coward, what shot Mr. Howard, put Jesse James in his grave
","My mother, who was from Missouri, used to sing that song. Except she'd get the words wrong, but it was a testimony to how much of a legend Jesse James was a century later. She was distantly related to the Youngers, who were the partners with the James gang.In any event, this movie portrays Robert Ford, the killer of Jesse James, as a disgruntled fan-boy who bought into the hero-worship of the dime novels, and was disappointed to find out his hero was really a garden variety psychopath.Still, there's a lot to recommend this movie, in how it recreates the world of 1880 Missouri. Brad Pitt is pretty good in the role of James, to where you aren't saying, 'Hey, that's Brad Pitt.' He disappears into the role completely. In fact, the only actor who did jump out at me as not sinking into the role was presidential adviser James Carville, who played the Governor who sanctioned James Murder.The movie drags in places, but it is a very compelling story. Affleck portrays Bob Howard in a very sympathetic way, pointing out that he had good reason to fear for his own life, that James was eliminating all of his associates.",10,1,3,21 February 2008
Batman Begins," A welcome departure
","From the Burton/Schumacher Batman movies. It actually tries to write Batman as someone who could live in our very real world, and even being filmed in Chicago, with it's very real backdrops.The Top tier villains being wasted in the previous four outings, Nolan scrapes the bottom of the villain barrel. This is probably a good thing, because we get to concentrate more on the character of Batman, who was largely overshadowed by his villains in the previous outings. He makes them more realistic, rather than over the top characters in Halloween costumes. Ra's al Ghul is not an immortal being, but just a guy who runs a shadowy organization. The Scarecrow is more of a run of the mill sociopath...So the movie concentrates on Batman and Bruce Wayne, along with his relationships with Alfred and Sergeant Jim Gordon. There is also the love relationship with Rachel Dawes (to end tragically in the next film), and a hint of what is to come with the Joker.",9,0,1,30 November 2009
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Words cannot describe the awfulness
","is this what movies are going to be now. Big CGI effects shows where they don't bother with plots or anything? I guess what made me angry about this film is that it was premised on what happens when the Mark Wallburg character gets back from the Tim Burton abortion and he finds Earth run by the apes now. So there's this virus that makes apes smart and kills humans, and apparently the CDC and its counterparts in the rest of the world became completely inept in containing it.Of course, this is a PG movie, so they can't actually show anyone getting murdered in the fall of humanity.They do some ham-fisted imitations of the previous films, including one totally unlikable character who reprises all the Charlton Heston dialog. I guess they got his shock prod when they pried it from his cold dead hands.Let's talk about CGI, shall we? This is Andy Sirkis once again playing a completely CGI character, and he does it well enough. He plays Caesar, a chimpanzee who gains human intelligence when treated with an Alzheimer's drug meant for John Lithgow.The thing is, I didn't care about any of the characters except maybe Lithgows. Everyone else was a cut-out cardboard stereotype with no dimension to their character.",1,27,53,23 December 2011
The Mist," Expiate the Weinsteins
","I was just wondering what would happen if a couple of Christian film makers produced a film where a Jewish character was portrayed as a hypocritical fanatic who was willing to kill people in a crisis and use the bible to justify it. I think we'd know what would happen. There would be unkind comparisons to Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, or worse, Mel Gibson (Gee, what happened to HIS career lately?) after which the aforementioned film makers would be run out of Hollywood on a rail.Yet the Weinsteins can make a film portraying a Christian in such an evil and cartoonish way, and it's perfectly acceptable.That was just one of my problems with this film. The others are too numerous to list. First, there is the typical portrayal of small town folks as stupid bumpkins easily led and manipulated. They do the most illogical things in a crisis. No one ever thinks of turning on a radio or a TV and trying to find out how widespread the crisis is, or using a cell phone to try to call out.Then there is the ending. I am going to tell you the ending in the hope you don't see this. After putting all of our sympathies with the few survivors who don't follow the Christian fanatic, they run out of gas in the mist, and choose to kill themselves rather than be killed by the monsters. Except when the protagonist survives, the army shows up and drives back the mist, meaning he killed his kid for nothing. Yes, the Weinsteins give one last flip of the bird to anyone who invested any sympathy to the heroes of the film.Can't blame Steven King for that part, his ending actually was more upbeat, at least allowing the potential the heroes survived. I have seen a lot of bad movies, made with a lot of heart and a little sloppiness. This is an expensive movie which insults its viewers.",1,6,14,27 March 2008
I Am Legend," Third Adaptation of Matheson's Novel
","This is an awesome movie.The story comes from the 1954 Richard Matheson novel of the same title, and has been twice adapted officially, in 1964 as 'The Last Man on Earth' with Vincent Price and in 1975 as 'The Omega Man' with Charlton Heston. The novel's lesser prodigy is just about every zombie movie you've ever seen, from George Romero's Dead series to movies like 28 Days Later.In short, there is really nothing original in the story, but what it lacks in that, it more than makes up in suspense, action and execution.This film is true to Matheson's vision in that it shows the hero's attempt to stay alive under difficult circumstances, not only fighting to find food and fight off the monsters, but to maintain what little is left of his sanity. In Matheson's novel, the monsters were more classical vampires (Matheson even came up with logic as to why they would be repelled by crosses and garlic). Here they are more a cross between vampires, zombies and orcs.What sells this movie more than the standard zombie flick that Hollywood seems to churn out with tedious regularity is Wil Smith. He carries this movie as a man who has endured unbelievable horrors but never gives up.There are deviations. In Matheson's book, Neville hunts the vampires with the intent of staying alive. Attempting to cure them is an afterthought later in the book. IN this film, he is trying to cure the disease all along. If you want to see a closer adaptation of the book, you should probably watch the 1964 version.",10,0,1,30 April 2008
Amadeus," The Director's Cut
","I don't have a lot to add to the movie that hasn't already been said, it is a truly awesome accomplishment.I do want to make some comments on the Director's cut. I think that the scenes were well performed and shot, but I'm not sure if they added anything to the movie. The whole scene in Madame Caliveri's dressing room was unnecessary. When she pummeled Mozart with the flowers, we had already gotten the point. Five more minutes of exposition on the point just made Salieri look dense.The scene with his ham-handed attempt to coerce Constanza into sex was questionable (Probably would have gotten the film an R rating if not cut). The fact that he could help and wouldn't was good enough. Then again, it does explain her open hostility to the guy in the death scene at the end.The canine concert was funny, but was completely unneeded.Another point, I usually hate historic films because they usually get so much wrong. Amadeus is a film I can forgive, partially because they repeat falsehoods that have been around for hundreds of years, and partially because it is such a well-made film. Still, I think it is fair to say the historic Antonio Salieri was a much better person than this film makes out.",10,1,3,14 March 2008
Gran Torino," Dirty Harry in Repose...
","Clint really plays his Dirty Harry character here, except now he's a retired autoworker living in a rundown neighborhood in what I presume is Michigan. He's alienated from his sons, thinks his grandchildren are disrespectful. Also he's apparently dying of cancer.He's pretty openly racist, living in a neighborhood where Hmong immigrants are moving in. He gets involved in a conflict between some gangbangers and a Hmong family that lives next door.This is really one of Clint's best performances. He takes the young man under his wing and guides him. He starts out being prejudiced, but then develops an understanding of the Hmong during the course of the movie.The best part was when he locked the young kid in his basement to keep him from taking revenge. It's a poignant moment that makes the film work. It's not always a pleasant movie to watch to be sure. But it's a great character and a pretty interesting story.",9,0,1,10 March 2012
Hero," Another film with gravity defying Chinese people...
","You know, there might have been a really kind of interesting story here about the history of China in ancient times.Instead, we got one of these martial arts movies with people who could defy gravity. Further complicated by the fact we get several versions of the same events.A Nameless assassin kills off three other assassins who tried to kill the first Emperor of China as he was busy unifying the country. But somewhere along the line, they all decide that China really needs to be unified, when they are done defying gravity in otherwise silly martial arts scenes.This has a few actors who have tried to break into American cinema with limited success. They are actually okay here.",6,0,5,2 December 2012
Ex Machina," dull, dreadful, silly ending
","So a super-genius who develops a sentient android needs to perform the 'Turing Test' to see if it is truly AI. Between bouts of drunken blackouts, he has a young coder develop a relationship with an android until we get to the predictable 'twist' ending.So they had kind of an interesting special effect to make an actress look like an android, but didn't bother to give us actresses that could act in the role.So the movie drags on with these personal interactions which are kind of boring, including the dumb scene where he doesn't figure out the Asian girl is an android, but thinks for a moment he might be.",4,8,16,24 July 2015
Men in Black II," Why this movie didn't work
","MIB2 suffered from several problems that Ghostbusters II suffered from.The first is, that by the second go-around, you have already accepted the premise. There are ghosts, and these lovable losers catch them. There are aliens amongst us, and these guys police them. Once you've accepted the premise, it just isn't as funny. It just doesn't seem as fantastical, and therefore, not as farcical.Another problem, both movie franchises had an animated cartoon in between movies. (The Ghostbusters cartoon was actually quite successful and ran for a season after the second movie, even though the second movie and cartoon had irreconcilable time lines.) In GBII, that meant that the ghost 'Slimer' became a more featured character because he was such a popular character in the cartoon series (even though his presence made little or no sense in the context of the second movie.) They were appealing to the kiddie audience.The second MIB movie had the same problem. The Worms, Frank the Pug and Junkman Jeebs were all minor characters in the first film, but were popular in the cartoon series. So all got major roles in the sequel. Probably Wil Smith contributed to this, since he tried to make the sequel more 'kid friendly' than the first. That meant the comedy wasn't nearly as biting.Still, you have to like this film. Wil Smith is charming and Tommy Lee Jones is bitingly ironic. Rosario Dawson is sexy. You want to like this film, it's just hard with the material.",4,1,3,21 January 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Swedish Version
","Interesting to compare and contrast. I watched about half an hour of this and lost interest before seeing the Daniel Craig English version. They jumbled about a few scenes and character interactions and who was related to who, exactly. But it's essentially the same plot in Swedish.The scenes where the female lead is raped and retaliates for being raped are a lot more graphic than the American version would allow.This movie was much cheaper and therefore not as well crafted. They didn't fit every character perfectly into his or her role.Still, I'd recommend it as a take, as it had two sequels that Hollywood can't wait to copy.In this one, the reporter actually goes to prison for libel, something that they didn't do in the American version probably because Americans wouldn't understand that in other parts of the world, they actually do that.",6,0,3,7 April 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Better than the Last one
","I really enjoyed this movie, and I didn't care for 'The Force Awakens' at all. The stuff with Rae and Luke Skywalker was great. Mark Hamill nails it and they give Luke's character a complete arc. Here he is a Jedi who has realized that the Force isn't something anyone should have been messing with to start with. Kylo Ren is more defined as a character. He's not the annoying 'Darth Emo' was as in the last movie. Po Dameron had more to do in this movie, and he'll probably have to step up in the next one as Carrie Fisher won't be back. Speaking of Carrie, she was pretty good in this one. This is going to be her last showing, so the only original characters we are going to have in the next one are Chewbacca and the Droids. Yoda's force Ghost is back, and he's back to being portrayed by a puppet, and not the awful CGI we saw in 'Clones' and 'Sith'. The stuff I didn't care for. Supreme Plot Device Snoke. Were you wondering what this guy did to found the First Order? Well keep wondering, this guy is a low-rent Palpatine imitator with no purpose. The whole Finn/Rose subplot. Not even entirely sure why it was there, it didn't go anywhere or advance the story or characters. It seemed to fall into 'they needed something to do'. Definitely worth watching.",7,1,9,15 December 2017
Clash of the Titans," There should be a rule against Remakes.
","Seriously, what is the point of even having remakes at all? IF the film was okay the first time out, there is no need to make it again...I think somewhere, there is a mentality in Hollywood that if you can't see a film with modern special effects, kids won't appreciate it on its own merits.We have all our old friends from the 1981 version, although the mechanical owl is thankfully only on screen for a second as a in joke. 'Take everything!' 'What about this?' 'Leave it!' The rest of it is paint by number script-writing, complete with the unwilling hero learning to be heroic on a hero's journey. Some of it was silly, such as the stuff with giant scorpions (much too long a sequence).Also, there were some bizarre religious issues going on here. For some reason, the mortals were attacking the Gods because the Gods weren't holding up their end of the deal, or something, but Hades is plotting to overthrow Zeus, not realizing he's Liam Freakin' Neesom. I think the writers were going for some criticism of religion in general, but it got bleached out in the rewrites...Oh, yes, you also have a hottie named 'Io' who is ageless and provides all sorts of exposition so the audience...oops, I mean the heroes don't get confused. Well, hey, the other guy got Burgess Meredith! Meanwhile the love story with Andromeda is overshadowed because that was the actual romance. This guy has a thing for the babe whose been looking over him since he was a baby! Hey, maybe this should have been about Oedipus... More seriously, what's the point of 'saving the princess' if you don't give a flip if the monster eats her or not? But the real problem is that the human actors are overshadowed by the curse of 21st century film making, CGI.",3,6,8,31 July 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Gods and Monsters
","One of Josh Whedon's talents is his ability to manage a story with multiple characters and giving those characters something interesting to do.This film takes the original 6 Avengers and adds three new ones. Yet I had no problem following the story and what was going on. Tony Stark attempts to create an artificial intelligence in order to combat all the alien threats to Earth, and creates Ultron, a robot who figures out the best way to protect humanity is to exterminate it.Not an original idea, and fans of Marvel Comics know these characters. Still, they manage to take a kind of hokey character and make him interesting. Heck, he was even able to make Hawkeye interesting as he conscience of the team.Also kudoes for the way they handled massive violence. Unlike other Superhero movies that quickly turn into Disaster Porn, these heroes remember their primary goal is to protect innocent life. Well done.Definitely worth watching.",9,2,8,3 May 2015
The Dark Knight," an Awesome movie, but a few complaints
","This movie totally had me until the last ten minutes... where I think they blew it.Let's start with what I liked. The characterizations. First, you have Heath Ledger as the Joker. Very in line with the best of the Batman comics, such as Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Killing Joke'. He brings a manic energy to the character, as someone who could kill someone with the casualness of swatting a fly. He is a force of pure chaos, as devious as Jigsaw in the Saw movies. The traps he sets up for Batman are brilliant, a truly worthy opponent.Michael Caine is awesome as Alfred. Alfred is Batman's conscience, what keeps him from going over to the dark side his adversaries inhabit.Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. They got it right. The Burton/Schumacher Batman movies never understood the importance of the character, but BB and TDK understand him perfectly. Morgan Freeman also did an awesome job as Lucius Fox.Now we move on to where I don't have the warm fuzzies.Maggie Glyenhall- Not as pretty as Katie Holmes, I really didn't connect with her character, and her demise didn't have the emotional impact it should have had because of it.Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman- Not as strong as he was in the first movie, probably because he got overshadowed by all these other characters. Also, his vocal changes between Batman and Bruce Wayne, his Batman voice comes off as raspy. (In the animated series, Kevin Conroy had two completely different vocalizations for Wayne and Batman, and they worked.) Aaron Eckhardt as Harvy Dent/Two-Face. His performance as Dent is brilliant. When he transforms into Two-Face, it's less convincing. Also, the CGI they used strained credulity. He looked more like a decomposing zombie than a scarred supervillian.Which brings me to the ending. I think everything was fine up until the point where Two-Face was holding Gordon's family hostage. Batman pushes Dent off the structure, and they both fall. Batman survives the fall but Two-Face dies? (Apparently?) So Gordon and Batman agree that Batman will get the blame for Two-Face's murders, so the memory of Harvey Dent will be kept alive.Two-Face is probably Batman's second best villain (after the Joker). If anything, he deserved his own movie as the chief antagonist, instead of just being killed as an afterthought. Overall, I think this movie had too much stuff going on in it. It would take one or two viewings to take it all in.Still, I recommend the movie.",9,6,13,19 July 2008
Avatar," 3-D effects, 1-D characters
","Some thoughts on this movie.First, in many ways, it was very manipulative. The bad guys were painted in the darkest tones, while the aliens and 'nice' humans were painted in the brightest colors. No one was given any depth. The amusingly named 'Unobtainium' (Really? Really?) is valuable, but they never tell you for what, or why they are willing to send people across the galaxy to die or kill for it.Even the character design was pulling the heart strings. Of course, the aliens look like your kitty-kat. Ooooooh, how cute! Meanwhile your mercenaries looked like thugs and rednecks.The movie telegraphs it's punches so loudly you might as well see the words 'PLOT POINT' flash across the screens. Like when the alien babe tells the hero that riding the Turok was a big honking deal. Well, you wouldn't be losing any money betting he'd be riding it by the end of the movie.Some point were laughable. Like the mecha that happened to have a big knife as part of the equipment. Okay, it looks cool and all, but what's the practical application of that? Not to mention the tedious pace in parts of the film. Kind of like Titanic when you said, 'Just hit the damned iceberg, already.' Not a bad film, but really overrated.",4,2,5,16 June 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Raimi returns to his roots, He should have left them buried.
","This was just not a very good movie, and I don't see what all the raving is about.Sam Raimi has achieved a lot of mainstream success, first with the Hercules and Xena franchise, then with the Spiderman movies. But we all remember he got his start with the schlocky 'Evil Dead' comedy/horror movies. 'Drag me to Hell' is in that vein, but it doesn't work.Oh, mind you, the production values are much better. Even the acting is a bit better. But are they as much fun? Not really.First, we have him doing to Alison Lohman what he normally used to do to Bruce Campbell. Sorry, comic/horror violence is just not as funny when the victim is a woman. And certainly not when she meets a gruesome end at the film's conclusion. So this somewhat likable girl is put through a ringer for the whole movie with no real redemption, no prevailing over evil.The supporting cast is totally unlikable, especially Justin Long as her castrati boyfriend. Some of the scenes were just there for comic effect. She just HAPPENED to have an anvil hanging from a rope that she could drop on the head of the Gypsy Zombie Apparition? Who's her interior decorator, Wile E. Coyote?",2,19,40,18 October 2009
Total Recall," Nothing like the real thing, baby!
","Having watched the flaming bag of dog poop that is the remake, I feel a need to praise the original for what it got right.First, the movie is wonderful in that you are not sure if it is all a dream or not all the way up until the very end of the film. this is VERY much in the spirit of Philip K. Dick, who originally wrote the film.Second, this movie was made with real people on real sets. There wasn't the abuse of the overuse of CGI and Green Screens we see today that frankly come off more and more as a blur where storytelling is lost. True, there was a lot of miniatures and special makeup effects, but that's what made it epic.THird, the characters. Arnold, Sharon Stone, Michael Ironsides, Ronny Cox, Rachel Ticotin- all made their characters intense and real, as opposed to zombies standing in front of a green screen.",10,2,5,30 December 2012
The Descent," A good scare movie
","If there was an award for 'original presentation of a totally unoriginal premise', The Descent would win hands down.It's not a perfect movie. The first hour of cave diving gets a bit monotonous before the monsters show up.First, it was nice to see a movie where female characters evolve above 'victim' and actually turn into kick-butt warrior princesses. The caves certainly added nicely to the very claustrophobic setting of the movie and were scary in their own right.The essential conflict between the two main characters (the other four are largely there to be monster chow, unfortunately) came out pretty nicely and that scene at the end where Sarah exacts her own little bit of justice on Juno worked well.",8,1,3,31 December 2006
Thor," Getting a difficult thing right. Awesome movie!
","As a Comic Book Geek, it has been just so disappointing to watch Hollywood butcher some of these great characters I've enjoyed since childhood. The X-Men movies still make me cringe. This film was handled by some of the best. J. Michael Straczynsky (Creator of Babylon 5) wrote the script, Kenneth Branagh directed, and it had two Academy Award winning actors (Portman and Sir Anthony Hopkins). All of this meant it was going to be really good or horribly bad. There really wasn't going to be a middle ground here.First, let's give credit to a smart script. First, the characters had depth, especially the character of Loki, who was not written as a one-dimensional bad guy. The actor who played Thor had a lot of charisma. a bit of my problem, they actually had to write this as 'Oh, wait, Loki is a bad guy?' kind of plot progression. Okay. I guess so, but that would require your audience to a) Not have ever read the comic or b) completely be ignorant of Norse mythology to not know the God of Mischief was going to be the bad guy here! Titanic had less plot tension. JMS, while taking a few liberties with characters, is very faithful to the original comic (which has had nearly a fifty year run). Usually I deplore the use of CGI, but here it worked in creating the fantastical realms of Norse Mythology.Another point. All these Marvel films are all leading up to the Avengers movie. They even make references to the other films. (Hulk and Iron Man).",10,4,9,8 May 2011
Zombieland," Not that funny...
","The essential plot is that the Zombie Apocalypse has happened and we have some humorous adventures of the four last survivors.We have the always painful to watch Woody Harrelson, and some other actors. And Bill Murry does a guest appearance, where he has managed to survive the Zombie apocalypse by dressing up as a Zombie, only to be accidentally shot by one of the characters.Hey, Bill, the only thing that's really 'undead' is your career, bud! Yeah, I know this is supposed to be a 'comedy', but honestly, the subject matter is too depressing. Someone else compared it to Shaun of the Dead, but that movie at least had some cheery parts to it.I think the real problem is, we've had too many Zombie movies ever since Richard Matheson wrote 'I am Legend' back in the 1954. What once was drama has now become farce.",5,0,1,6 February 2010
Downfall," A movie that makes you feel like you were there
","This film is an accurate portrayal of the last days of World War II, where an increasingly insane Adolf Hitler becomes more disconnected from reality, while those around him panic.Many of you might know this film from all the parodies where a ranting Hitler is shown screaming about some contemporary issue. You'll giggle at that scene, but the other scenes are quite well done, and make you forget for a moment that Hitler was indeed a monster. Here he comes off like a sympathetic figure.Quite graphic in its way, it's best to watch this film in the original German with subtitles.Some parts of the film are uncomfortable to watch, such as children being used as cannon fodder in Berlin's defense, or Magda Goebbels poisoning her own children rather than let them live in a Nazi-free world. But these things actually happened, and they increase the horror the director was trying to get across.",9,0,2,27 March 2011
Jaws," Book Vs. Movie
","Who are we kidding, this film is a classic. Not much more to add.What I want to point out is that Jaws is the exception that proves a rule. IN this case, the rule is, Books are always better than the Movie. It's almost always true in all but a few cases, and in the few cases, the book wasn't any great shakes to start with.Peter Benchley's Jaws was a heavily marketed book because they knew they were going to make a film out of it. The problem is, if they filmed it as written, it would have been confusing, the characters unlikable (seriously, you'd have been cheering for the Shark!) and the subplots weren't even logical. Thankfully, they scrapped almost all of it in Carl Gottlieb's rewrite.Then you have the factor of Spielberg himself, then a young, cutting edge director. (As opposed to today, where he's such a mega-producer, no one dares tell him he's making garbage like 'IJ4: Crystal Skull'.).Finally, you had the actors, perfectly cast for these parts, taking them and making them their own.",10,3,6,5 September 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Review- Contains Spoilers
","A truly awesome movie, it recaptures the magic of the first one.The film begins with a Annikan Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobe leading an attack to rescue Chancellor Palpatine from the clutches of Count Dooku and General Grevious. A light-saber battles ensues where Obi-Wan is knocked unconscious and Dooku is disarmed (literally) by Annikan. In a scene that mirrors the ending of Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Palpatine urges Annikan to kill Dooku. Annikan does, but almost immediately regrets it. Another step is taken onto the path to the Dark Side.After being re-united with Padme, Annikan discovers she is pregnant. Their secret marriage risks being exposed. Worse, Annikan is haunted by dreams that she'll die in childbirth. Meanwhile, the Jedi Council has come to distrust the Chancellor, who has held onto power using the War as a pretext. Political maneuver ensues, with both the Chancellor and the Council trying to manipulate Annikan into working for them.What follows are battles, a lot of special effects and a darned good time. This is a far better movie than Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones. There are times when the FX and action are a little overwhelming, like too much spice covering up the meat of the plot.Some things I didn't like. There's an inconsistency where Padme dies in childbirth, contradicting Leia's statement in 'Jedi' that she remembers her mother as a sad woman. I thought they killed off Count Dooku too quickly - Christopher Lee was the best thing in Clones, and they really waste him here. General Grevious just looked silly, and they couldn't kill him off fast enough.The real star of this movie is Iam McDiarmod as Palpatine/Darth Sideous/the Emperor. He cleverly manipulates Skywalker into destroying the Jedi.",10,2,6,21 May 2005

Let's make Holmes a dysfunctional slob, and Watson a gambling jerk, and give them some kind of frustrated bro-mance, with no chemistry.Yeah, we'll use Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr., but it will still stink.Okay, the CGI looked good, and they did some great set direction, but deep down, you don't care.

A centurion is captured, escapes, joins up with an invading Roman Legion, which is promptly slaughtered.There are less than subtle allegories to terrorism and imperialism, not sure if they entirely work here.

Prometheus," The Curse of Prequels
","is that knowing how we got to the point where we came in is never as interesting as we thought it would be.Darth Vader and Hannibal Lector were made less interesting by their back stories, not more.So we have these archaeologists who convince the Evil Company to fund their Trillion Dollar expedition to find this planet where the 'engineers' lived. The Engineers are 9-foot tall humanoid giants who created mankind, apparently. But it wasn't their homeworld, it was just their bio-testing lab, and the Engineers decided humanity was some kind of mistake that they needed to eradicate. Since this happened 2000 years ago, it was not because they had seen an episode of 'Keeping up with the Kardashians.' So what you have here is an Alien Movie without the aliens. Not to mention a bunch of characters who do things that make not a lick of sense just to keep the action scenes going. (The Red Letter Media guys cover most of these pretty well.) Visually, it's a treat. Plot terms, it just takes the logical flaws from the Alien Movies and compounds them. (Seriously, you think at some point, Weyland-Yutani would lose their shirts...) The only nice thing is that it eliminates the Alien v. Predator movies from Canon, so there's that.",6,2,5,24 June 2012
The Woman in Black," All flavor, no meat.
","This movie has a lot of great creepy atmospherics hung on a plot line that is thinner than most pornographic movies where when they still felt an obligation to put a plot line out there.Oh, the scenes are staged very well, but the story makes not a lick of sense. And it all leads up to an ending that is kind of depressing.I'm also noticing a trend here, of putting movies 'in the past' because if you put them in the present, things like internet and cell phones kind of totally screw up your ability to tell a story. This story occurs I'm guessing some time in the early 20th century, probably before WWI. But Spiritualism is mentioned, so it might be after WWI.So an evil rich couple steals the child of her sister, and her ghost is killing all the poor people in the village's children. Or something.Frankly, it's slow, meandering and just describing it, I've dropped my rating another two points.",2,5,8,28 May 2012
X-Men: First Class," Probably the Best X-men Movie
","I thought this was one of the better X-men movies. I think it had the misfortune of being preceded by four movies that were worse, so it was like saying, 'Trust me, I'm an X-Men movie', and people had tuned out. (It barely broke even, from what I understand.) the plot is that Mutants are just emerging in the early 1960's, and a young Charles Xaiver and Eric Leshnerr must stop a plan by ex-Nazi Sebastian Shaw to start a nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis.Now, some points. The X-Men did first premiere in 1962, and it includes a lot of the classic characters from that period- Beast, Banshee, Havok. It also includes characters from later incarnations. If you are looking for ANY consistency with the comics, you will be disappointed. You'll probably be disappointed with the fact it doesn't seem to be consistent with the other 'Prequel' starring Wolverine, but the less said about that the better.Despite these liberties taken with the actual characters, the thing got closer to the flavor of the comic book series than anything else we've ever seen them do.",Null,0,1,2 October 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," A fitting conclusion the the Trilogy
","The film works well as a combination of its parts.The regulars- Bale, Caine, Freeman and Oldman enter great performances as Batman characters who could exist in a real world. The weakness is that they are frequently absent for large stretches of the film while the film introduces us to new characters and takes their time introducing them.Tom Hardy as Bane- Have to say, this was the one I had the most worries about, because this guy really screwed up the character of Shinzon in Star Trek Nemesis, and Bane was never my favorite Batman villain to start with. Happy to say, I was surprised by his performance here.Ann Hathaway as Catwoman (which she is never actually called) AKA Selina Kyle. Actually, quite a good performance, the character is completely consistent with what we see in the comics. Bravo.Marion Collitard as Miranda, who we later find out is (SPOILER) Talia Al Ghul, the daughter of the Liam Nissam character in the first movie.Finally, you have the character of Blake, a good cop who believes in Batman and becomes Gordon's protégé...Mostly this film works. My only problem with it was the Batman in Prison scenes, which dragged on for far too long.",10,3,8,21 July 2012
Iron Man," The most Awesome adaptation of a Marvel Comic yet!
","This film is awesome on so many levels.First, the performances. Downey completely dominates the role of Tony Stark, a guy who goes from being kind of an arrogant, self-absorbed jerk to a hero. He still manages to keep a sense of humor about him despite all that is happening. Paltrow is his unrequited assistant, Pepper Potts, and Jeff Bridges is the double-dealing Obediah Stane. All of the actors seamlessly meld into their characters.The story is very true to the original comics by Stan Lee, with updates to make it more contemporary. (In Lee's original, Stark has his origin as a prisoner in Vietnam.) Unlike a lot of Marvel Adaptations, they've made the story captivating, even if you are a hard-core comic fan who already knows the tale.The special effects, unlike some of FX sequences, are good but don't dominate the story. The same can be said of the action scenes.W",10,2,5,4 May 2008

Thor and Loki must work together to stop them.Chris Hemsworth is pretty good again as Thor. Tom Hiddelston once again steals the scenes he is in as Loki. Most of the cast from the original movie has returned, and put in solid performances.The most disappointing aspect is that Christopher Eccelston plays a villain that is completely forgettable. Seriously, I barely recognized the guy and frankly, they could have done him as CGI and no one would have noticed the difference. (Of course, his turn as Doctor Who was equally forgettable.)

Most of the characters are functional. They are there to move the plot along and then we don't see them again.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Upon Further reflection, an updated review
","Or maybe I'm just not the wide-eyed teenager I was when saw Star Wars (I refuse to call it 'A New Hope') in 1977. J.J. Abrams has produced a pretty good story here, but much like his Star Trek movie, I don't think he fully grasps the source material. For Instance, when the Death Star Mark III blows up 'The Republic', what were they blowing up, exactly? Coruscant from the prequel films? (Other outside material indicates it's another planet) Who is the First Order, and why do they seem to have updated versions of all the Empire's Stuff? It seems like 30 years have passed since 'Return of the Jedi', but things seem pretty much the same. And this is the biggest problem I had with the film. Jedi had the main characters complete their Arcs. Han and Leia were together, the Empire was defeated, Luke had mastered his Jedi Powers, Vader had been turned back to the light side of the force. In this one, Luke has turned his back on the Jedi, the First Order comes up as a more Nazi-like version of the Empire, Han has gone back to being a petty criminal. It's like the whole first trilogy didn't happen or everyone is even worse off than they were before. And then there is Luke Skywalker, who doesn't show up until the last 30 second of the film and looks like a homeless person. Now I'm going to talk about the whole scene where (SPOILERS) Han Solo is killed by his son, Darth Emo.... errr Kylo Ren. It's very derivative, of when Obi-Wan is killed In Star Wars of Qua-gon is killed in 'Phantom Menace'. That and apparently there are no safety-rails in the Star Wars universe. So we have someone else dropping thousands of feet after being wounded with a light-saber. I do like the fact this film had a strong female protagonist, a conflicted anti-hero. I like the fact that when a planet is destroyed, we actually get to see the horrified people on it. (Something that was missing from Star Wars, and emphasized the true horror of the weapon). I like the fact the battle scenes looked like they involved real actors in real costumes, and not some CGI'd cloned troopers versus robots. It felt more REAL to me, especially when you see the ground littered with casualties, just like you'd have in a real war. I like the First Order. It seems truly evil in a way the Sith and Empire were not in the earlier films. (They kidnap and brainwash babies to be Stormtroopers). I also like the star ship effects. I like that the desert planet appears to have suffered severe consequences of the War. IN short, it was a great movie, but it raised more questions than it answered about a universe that is very familiar to its fans.",4,8,23,26 December 2015
The Purge," A mixed bag....
","Rating this at 5 right in the middle.The Good parts- the atmospherics are genuinely creepy. The use of the monitors to track the killers outside and create a sense of menace are well shot and the pacing is pretty good.The Bad Part - the premise is completely illogical. Letting the whole country tear itself apart for one night is supposed to bring economic prosperity? Really? The Homeless guy- Portrayed as a Christ-like character. They make sure we know he's a veteran by giving him dog tags, and he even offers to give himself up to the mob to save the family. I guess to avoid being too heavy-handed on the racial angle, they made some of the second group of angry neighbors ethnic as well.Which brings me to the next point. (SPOILER) The whole 'twist' at the end was that the neighbors who had all bought security systems from this family were now seeking revenge because they didn't like that he got rich selling them security systems. That was telegraphed at the beginning and didn't come as a surprise at all.Oh, the boyfriend subplot. So he's going to resolve the father's objections to him by killing the father? Did he really think this through? Again- mixed bag. If they made the premise a little more logical, it would have been thoroughly enjoyable.",5,1,2,27 December 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," After 25 years, parts of it hold up, parts of it don't.
","I still really want to say good things about this movie.In some ways, this movie doesn't hold up. The special effects are cheap and the synthesizer music is kind of corny. Unlike other films in the franchise, this one had a cheap budget. The key weakness is Heather Langenkamp. She's a better makeup artist than an actress, which is why her career as an actress was limited after this. The other problem is Freddy himself. Now, we all know Freddy from the later movies as the wise-cracking, find inventive ways to kill teenagers character we saw in the sequels. Here, he's just a straight up monster, no witty comments or clever gags. He just straight up murders people. Speaking of Murder, we have only four murders in this entire movie. That's it. Freddy is kind of a slacker compared to Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees. The film does have some great moments from Wes Craven, who does know how to frame a shot to make it scary.",8,1,2,1 December 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," I really hate saying bad stuff about a Josh Whedon Production
","Because I like so much of his work.The problem with this movie is that it was TOO clever. A typical group of American Horror Movie victims is placed in a scenario where they have to inadvertently pick their monster and be killed in order to appease ancient gods, all organized by a corporate bureaucracy who are competing to make sure that they beat their competition, who are staging a parallel Japanese Horror Movie.(A funny line, 'How hard is it to kill a bunch of nine-year olds?' when their Japanese counterparts fail.) The victims escape the trap involving zombies and encounter werewolves, Cenobites and other 'not quite violating someone else's copyright' monsters before Sigourny Weaver shows up to provide exposition.Josh, I love you man, but I never cared about any of these characters. Characters breaking through the fourth wall can be interesting, but you can't make a whole movie out of it.",5,0,3,3 November 2012
Gladiator," The ending destroyed it for me
","As a Roman History Buff, the ending destroyed it. You have the ending where the fictional Maximus kills Commodus (a real Roman Emperor) in gladiatorial combat. (Commodus was actually strangled in his bath when poison wasn't killing him fast enough.) The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the 'Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline.",1,33,73,20 April 2010
The Birds," The Master of Suspense
","The movie starts out with this series of odd character interactions, as a rich socialite stalks a lawyer who pulls a prank on her.For some odd reason, the birds- all species- are making war on humans in this little town. It's never explained why, and an explanation isn't necessary. In some ways, it was the zombie movie before Romero. It isn't so much about what is attacking or why, it's about how the people involved react.The first few bird attacks are subtle... it's not until halfway through the movie the things goes off on the crazy train. And when they do, look out, a real sense of menace ensues.The special effects, done without computers, still hold up. More importantly, the characters still hold up. TOday, we'd see more CGI and less characters we cared about.",8,3,6,8 November 2012
Valkyrie," Good Movie, questionable history
","I really did like this movie in that it was a good story, well told. Unfortunately, Tom Cruise's reputation for being, well, cuckoo for coco-puffs detracted from the actual quality of the work he did here.The history is questionable. The conspirators are shown as guys who were horrified at what Hitler was doing, which is bunk. Most of them had no problem with the war when Germany was winning. It's when Germany started losing they started growing a backbone. Von Stauffenburg was no exception.Now, all that said, the pacing is pretty good. Even being fairly familiar with the story, the pacing and suspense kept me going. They did a good job creating this world (for instance, how much hinged on vintage 1940's style communications).the Supporting characters were quite good. even the actor who played Hitler avoided ranting cliché that most movies portrayed him as and showed him as somewhat charismatic with a politician's gift.",6,1,2,7 June 2009
The Simpsons Movie," I actually stopped watching the series after this movie
","Because when you got right down to brass tacks, it's the same plot as EVERY other episode of the Simpsons. Homer does something incredibly stupid, alienating not just his neighbors, but his family as well. He then has to do something to redeem himself, usually enduring horrible pain and/or humiliation in the process.This is a fan movie, where they manage to have a vignette for every one of the series dozens of characters. You won't get the Comic Book Guy jokes unless you've seen the series and know who Comic Book Guy was. 'Lamest. Analogy. Ever.'Of course, the creators of this show are liberals, and they let their liberal stripes show, criticizing the Patriot Act and environmental deregulation. It's cute and all, but honestly, the Simpsons jumped the Shark a long time ago.",4,4,6,30 September 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," A pretty good film....
","The 'At the Movies' guys dumped all over this film, which just tells me that 'At the Movies' needs to be dumped.The plot line is that an inventor's (Gerard Butler, who got a producing credit) wife and child are murdered by a pair of home intruders. The protagonist, a prosecutor played by Jaime Foxx, proceeds to cut a deal with the more guilty to get a death penalty conviction against the least culpable of the pair. He feels sick about it.Flash forward a decade later. The criminal is about to be executed, but someone switches his lethal injection drug with something that causes far more pain. His accomplice is manipulated into running from the cops into the hands of the Inventor, who proceeds to murder him by painfully dismembering the guy, and filming it.The movie continues as a battle of wits between Butler and Fox, as the bodies pile up.The movie has some outright implausible plot devices, but it is entertaining, and even predictable shots are handled with such deft that they still shock.Also, a shout out to Colm Meany, the only guy from Star Trek Deep Space Nine who is still acting... He plays a tough Irish detective.",8,0,0,20 February 2010
The Island," Send in the Clonus
","This movie was a complete ripoff of the 1979 movie 'Parts: The Clonus Horror'. Except that apparently the writers didn't think all that much of ripping off someone else's idea and not giving them credit, leading to lawsuits and hilarity.Of course, this being Hollywood, they engaged in a lot of sanitizing that gave it a happier ending and made the concept less horrifying. (Clones are grown full grown rather than being raised from babies.) But the premise is so similar the ripoff was obvious. A farm is growing clones to serve as backup organs for the rich, powerful and famous. Ewan McGregor plays both the clone and the jerk he's serving to back up. So the first half of the movie is pretty much straight ripoff.The second half is dumbed down, action movie schlock, like we've come to expect from Michael Bay.But what irritates me is that they sanitized the ending. In the original, it's a rather dark ending, the hero is recaptured, harvested for his heart and the rest of him is put on ice for other organ transplants. His girlfriend is lobotomized. In this one, they survive their donors and McGregor takes over the other guy's life.Okay, the original was made on the cheap and not very good actors. But it had a message about how science can be used for evil. This one, meh, we need a happy ending. It's Ewan McGregor.",Null,1,3,23 July 2011
