The Young Victoria," Like The Moves On A Chessboard
","With all of the films of recent,dealing with the British Monarchy,is it really time for another? Answer:YOU BET! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from Britain dealing with the Royal family. In this case,it deals with the early life of Princess Victoria,and events leading up to the Coronation of her becoming Queen of all England,as well as her romance & eventual wedding to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the tempestuous lives & careers of both England's Queen & Prince,as well as several other events that transpire (political turmoil,etc.). Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth,while Rupert Friend is her beloved & best friend,Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of Miranda Richardson,as the Dutchess of Kent,and the always welcome on screen,Jim Broadbent as King William,as well as a cast of others that shine on screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y.,Loser Love),directs from a winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair,Gosford Park,Separate Lies). I absolutely went out of my head over the film's visual look (by cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker),who gave each frame of film a painterly look (with the help of production designer,Patrice Vermette),as well as some tight editing (by Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated in Fellowes' script is the use of a game of Chess,as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivation (the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a Chess board). This is smart,well written,directed,filmed,edited & acted entertainment (and enlightenment)that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema. Rated PG by the MPAA for a few scenes of sensuality,some brief violence ( a little bloody,although nothing too gory),a rude outburst of language,and some on screen smoking",10,2,4,3 January 2010
The Hangover," Better Than I Had Expected
","When I first heard word of this film, I had my doubts (oh no,not another Porky's gross fest with zero laughs). I did,however, ended up checking it out,due to plan changes one night after work. When four friends,one due to be married in a couple of days,ends up heading to Las Vegas to gamble & party for one debauched night,trouble (and laughs)ensue when the four toast with drugged liquor. The day after,three of them are in their hotel suite,totally trashed (and the hotel suite wasn't faring any better,what with furniture trashed,a live chicken drifting about,and an even more live tiger in the bathroom),with no recollection of what happened. The worst part is that they seem to have lost the groom. The following makes for a laugh filled film (that does supply the gross jokes,but are funny,none the less). The trio of boneheads have to find the groom within the next couple of days,or else... Todd Phillips ('Old School','Road Trip','Hated:G.G. Allin & The Murder Junkies'---believe it or not!)directs from a screenplay written by Jim Lucas & Scott Moore. The film has a cast of relative unknowns,but does feature at least a couple of familiar faces in the crowd (Heather Graham from 'Drugstore Cowboy' & 'Boogie Nights',among others,and Mike Tyson...yes,THE Mike Tyson,as himself). This is an all out funny comedy for adults who are looking for a few laughs on a Saturday night. Rated 'R' by the MPAA for vulgar language,nudity,sexual content,drug content & all out gross out humour.",9,1,2,20 September 2009
Star Trek," In The Beginning,There Was Kirk...James T. Kirk
","After the last couple of Star Trek films started to show their age, I figured, 'it's time to put this horse out to pasture'. Imagine my utter surprise (and delight)when I found out that there was to be a brand new Star Trek film, with a cast of relative unknowns playing younger versions of the legendary characters (although,blink & you'll miss Wynonna Ryder in a cameo/walk on,as well as Leonard Nimoy in a nice turn as...well...um...Mr. Spock,the elder), I thought, 'well, it'll be nice to see some fresh blood being injected into this iron poor blood series. Short story long,it happened (oh joy!). As I've always enjoyed the original series,some of the offshoots (ST:The Next Generation),and the early films with the original cast from the series, this new adventure,I'm happy to announce,is a feather in my cap (as well as some hard core Trekkies). The plot concerns the early years of James T.Kirk,from birth,to being Captain of the Enterprise. Along the way,we are also introduced to younger versions of Scotty,Bones,Uhura,and yes, Mr. Spock. Director J.J. Abrams (Lost) manages to work with a mighty tasty script that Gene Roddenbury would have been proud to be affiliated as his brain child,carried on. Abrams manages to keep both character interaction,as well as some pretty hairy action sequences for the thrill 'em crowd,without lowering himself to cheap jack Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich mindless bombast. A fun evening at the movies is in store for audiences either craving, or missing their fix of Star Trek (at least until/if a sequel is in store for the foreseeable future). Rated PG-13 by the MPAA,this film contains a bit of rude language,action/adventure violence (but nothing really gross or gory)& some sexy goings on between Kirk & an alien",10,1,13,10 July 2009
The Secret in Their Eyes," The Mirrors Of The Soul
","Are you in the mood for a well written,directed & acted drama,with a hint of romance & intrigue? You can't do much better than 'El secreto de sus ojos' (released in English speaking countries as 'The Secret In Their Eyes'),a film that was Argentina's entry for the Academy Awards for best film from that country. It tells the story of a retired defense attorney (Benjamin Esposito,played by the fine Argentine actor,Ricardo Darin,of 'XXY',and 'Nine Queens'fame) who is writing his memoirs,in hopes of turning them into a book. When he becomes interested in trying to re-open the case of a brutal rape/murder,he goes to his former employer for leads (Irene Menendez-Hastings,played by Soledad Villamil). What Benjamin discovers is lost feelings he felt for Irene). Cutting back & forth in time,we see stories of the young Benjamin & Irene working for the same government law firm,and the ups & downs of the law profession in 1970's Argentina,during their dirty war,which is never mentioned. This is a smart,well written screenplay (by the film's director,Juan Jose Campanella,mostly known for his work in both Argentinian,as well as American television,and Eduardo Sacheri,from the novel by Sacheri). Besides the above mentioned cast,the film also features Pablo Rago,Javier Godino,Barbara Palladino,Rudy Romano & Juan Jose Ortiz. Juan Jose Campanella wears three hats as director,co-writer & film editor. The film's lush cinematography is by Felix Monti. This is bravura film making for thinking persons who demand more from film than just car chases,explosions,fart jokes & other mindless droppings from Hollywood. Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains some strong language,flashes of an unpleasant rape scene,nudity & bloody violence",10,7,10,12 May 2010
Pirate Radio," Rockin' The North Sea
","In 1966,the British government clamped down on popular music by pretty much all but eliminating it from the airwaves. Only about two hours of rock & roll could be heard on the BBC (the national network,which oversaw both radio & television). A group of renegade DJ's fought back by starting an illegal micro broadcasting station (i.e. 'pirate' radio station)that transmitted from an abandoned fishing boat in the North Sea,that would blast out England's beloved rock & roll, 24/7/365,much to the chagrin of the government goons that wanted nothing more than to silence it forever. This was Radio Caroline. This film,'The Boat That Rocked' (released in the U.S. as Pirate Radio)attempts to tell a (somewhat)fictionalized tale of what could have happened. Richard Curtis directs from a toothsome screenplay about rocking in the face of adversity. The film is cast with (mostly)a top notch group of U.K. based actors (including Rhys Iffans,Kenneth Branagh & Emma Thompson,seen recently in 'An Education'),but has some real nice screen time from American actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman as a DJ known only as 'The Count'. The screenplay also manages to go into the lives of a number of the denizens of the floating radio station. Above everything,there is the music (and what a soundtrack!),which includes the likes of The Who,Dusty Springfield,Jimi Hendrix,The Troggs,and way too many to mention here (a soundtrack CD is available,unfortunately only in the U.K.,so you may have to scour about for pricey imported CD's,at least until a U.S. release of the soundtrack CD is made available). Okay,there are a couple of obvious flaws here (despite the fact that the story takes place in 1966,there is music heard from 1967 & beyond),but if you can look beyond this,this is a fun packed film that will have your toe tapping,even if you were not around back in the day. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains rough language,sexual content,including brief flashes of nudity & a bit of dope smoking by one of the more bohemian members of the radio staff.",10,2,4,27 November 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Creme De La Kubrick
","Even some forty-five years after the release of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of cold war paranoia, 'Dr.Strangelove Or:How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb', it still to this day packs the same punch it packed in 1964. The screenplay (written by Kubrick,in collaboration with Terry Southern & Peter George)was adapted from the novel, 'Red Tide',that dealt with the possibility of an all out war with Russia. Kubrick, as usual takes many pot shots at the military (United States,as well as the British),as well as the ruling class that preside over the military (and even gets a few jabs at Russia,for good measure). A psychotic general,named General Jack D. Ripper,finally goes over the edge & calls for bombers flying over the Arctic Circle to drop a payload of atomic bombs on Russia. This triggers a catastrophic series of events. Kubrick has assembled a top notch cast to play out the various characters that pop up for the mayhem. The late, great Peter Sellers plays no less than three roles. Add the likes of George C. Scott,Sterling Hayden,Slim Pickens and even (a then unknown) James Earl Jones,as well as others,and you have yourself the basis for a sparkling cocktail of a political satire that will make you laugh,shudder,and finally think of our future. Originally released unrated in 1964,this film was eventually handed a GP rating in 1970, which was eventually changed to a PG rating for a rude word or two, some violent (but not graphic)content,some sexual humour & the potential disturbing consequences of nuclear war & it's aftermath.",10,1,2,4 June 2009
Shutter Island," We Have Met The Enemy, And It's......
","Let us all raise our glasses & toast Martin Scorsese. For well over fifty years now,he has made a mark for himself as a gifted film maker, film historian & a name in film preservation. Since his early student short films,leading to his first feature film, 'Who's That Knocking At My Door?' (which gave some fame to a then,unknown Harvey Keitel),to his work for Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock,as an assistant camera operator,as well as other projects. Now,he brings us his homage to Alfred Hitchcock in 'Shutter Island'. Shutter Island is about two federal Marshall's,investigating the disappearance of an inmate at a facility for the criminally insane,where the worst mental patients go, just off the coast of Massachusetts. Teddy Daniels,a crackerjack federal marshal,who is just gung ho about his job,has some serious issues of his own (he is a world war 2 veteran,with one too many skeletons in his closet for his own good),tries to crack the case,when he discovers something seriously wrong about the hospital/prison,where he is assigned,when he starts to poke around & makes some discoveries he probably should not have. Martin Scorsese directs from a screenplay written by Laeta Kalogrides (who also acts as one of the executive producers,among others),adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane. The film's atmospheric cinematography (which goes for a nice touch of expressionism)is by Robert Richardson,with some 'right on the money' editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio,as Teddy Daniels,Mark Ruffalo as his partner,Chuck Aude,Ben Kingsley channels some genuine creepiness as Dr. Cawley,with Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer,Patrica Clarkson,Jackie Eare Haley (currently seen on screen as Freddy Krueger in the recent remake of 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'),and if that wasn't enough...the great Max Von Sydow (known for his work for Ingmar Bergman,among others),as Dr. Naehring. Despite the bad trailer for this film,which makes it look like your basic garden variety horror film,this is a shining example of a suspenseful thriller that one can sink their teeth into (and something Alfred Hitchcock would have approved of). Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for strong language & some bloody & disturbing images that could scare (and even scar) very young viewers",10,0,2,2 May 2010
The White Ribbon," Back (once again) In The 'Bad Old Days' (homage a' R.W. Fassbinder)
","Back in the 1970's,German film maker,Rainer Werner Fassbinder directed a film adaptation of the novel,'Effi Briest' that was in every way a 19th century costume drama that some found a meditation into the human condition,and others found a crashing bore (the film clocks in at nearly two and a half hours,is in German with English subtitles,and is very slowly paced). Flash forward thirty plus years later (2009),and Austrian film maker,Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher,Hidden)has gone and directed an absolutely glowing film dealing with events leading up to World War 1 (which,like Fassbinder's film,is nearly two & a half hours,mostly in German,and moves at a snails pace,which does not ruin the film one bit). That film is 'The White Ribbon' (known in Europe as 'Das Weisse Band-Eine Deutsche Kindergeschichte'). The film takes place in an un-named village in north Germany in 1913. When the local doctor is injured in an accident that seems to be deliberately planned,it leads to a series of one unfortunate event after another. The events are narrated from the perspective of a newly arrived school teacher (played by Christian Friedel,with a voice over by an obviously aged teacher,in later years by Ernst Jacobi). The teacher (as his name is never mentioned)takes a fancy to a local young lass,Eva (played by Leonie Benesch),but knows her father will never consent to his proposal of marriage,due to the fact that Eva is much younger than he. Other events unfold in this beautifully photographed drama (by cinematographer Christian Berger) that proposes that certain events & attitudes were responsible for the onset of World War I,and the rise of Nationalism,which would eventually lead to the formation of the Fascist party in the early days just after World War I,throughout Europe (acts of sadistic violence toward ethnic groups & the handicapped were not out of the question). Michael Haneke writes & directs this quiet,but powerful drama that (potentially)points accusing fingers at those who were responsible for darker times that were to come (religion is cited as a major catalyst for the troubles---as embodied by Burghant Klaussner's brilliant portrayal of The Pastor,a cold hearted,loveless father of a cadre of children who channeled a 'Village Of The Damned' vibe---truly creepy). Other figures weave in and out of this well played out drama,for thinking persons who crave more than Hollywood eye candy (and get it). Spoken in German,Polish,Italian & Latin with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains some rather disturbing violence,muted sexual content & other adult content. Probably not a good choice for the little ones.",10,0,4,25 February 2010
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," 3(D) Times The Fun
","Hey Mom & Dad. Are you dealing with a rainy day,with the kiddies driving you crackers with 'I'm so bored...There's nothing to do,today' every five minutes? Then by gum,pack the whole gang in the car & drive on over to your local multiplex & treat the little ones to a screening of 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' (and even if you have no little ones,still go to check it out---you'll be glad you did). This is Columbia/Sony Pictures contribution to the ever growing array of 3D-CGI (three dimension,computer generated images)animation. The screenplay,adapted from the beloved book by the authors themselves (Judi Barrett & Ron Barrett)doles out the fun factor a whopping 10+. The direction is handled well by Phil Lord & Chris Miller (both known for their work in television). The story:a little island township,mainly known for it's contribution to fishing is starving for tourism (there is literally nothing to eat but fish there). Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader,of Saturday Night Live,fame)is a failed inventor,who is trying to invent a machine that turns water into food, which goes bananas (ouch---bad pun!)& turns into a satellite that does manage to turn rain clouds into food that rains upon the island. Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris,of the Scary Movie series)is the perky weather anchor of the local 'Weather News Channel' (obviously a double edged pun on the Weather Channel,as well as Cable News Network)is there to report on the proceedings (and perhaps forge a friendship with the nerdy,introverted Flint). Other familiar voices that turn up for good measure include,James Caan (as Flint's skeptical father,Tim), Bruce Campbell (as the rather shady Mayor Shelbourn),Mr. T (as a well meaning,but overly macho policeman,Earl Deveraux),and even Al Roker (from NBC's Today Show),as Patrick Patrickson,Benjamin Bratt & Neil Patrick Harris turn up to supply voices for some minor characters. This film is being released in both 3D Digital,as well as standard 2D versions (check your local newspaper for whatever cinemas are screening which version---although I would recommend the 3D edition). At the screening that I attended,both youngsters,as well as parents had a good old time with this one (as did I). Now, it's your turn. Rated PG by the MPAA,for some thematic element (although I would guess that it's being released as a PG,just to guarantee wider distribution,as I really didn't find anything that a parent would object to).",10,3,5,9 October 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Into A Darker Labyrinth
","When journalist Mikael Blomquist is sued by a financier,due to allegations of corruption (and is looking at possible jail time),he is temporarily given a 'holiday break' from the magazine he is working for. Mikael is hired by the aged patriarch of the highly dysfunctional millionaire family,the Vangers. Mikael is given free reign to find out just what happened to Harriet Vanger,who vanished from the family at the age of 16. Mikael finds out just how screwed up the Vanger clan really is,and is drawn into a web of corruption,political graft,potential murder,sexual perversion,and other elements he probably should have just taken a pass and just taken time off,instead. Also figuring into all of this is a mysterious young woman known as Lisbeth Salendar,a woman who has been the whipping girl for far too long (she has a short fuse,an attitude problem,and other dark issues as well). Somehow,these two bond to try & sort out all of this insanity. Denmark's Niels Arden Oplev directs from a screenplay written by Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg,from the celebrated novel by the late Swedish author,Stieg Larsson. This is the first chapter in a trilogy of films based on Larsson's novels,which has already been filmed,and has been released throughout Europe. I eagerly await the next two films. Spoken in Swedish with English subtitles. Not rated by the MPAA,this film contains pervasive strong language,strong sexual content,nudity & some graphic,bloody violence that will disturb some (and this is from the same country that originally banned Star Wars in 1977,because it was considered too violent for it's time)",10,3,6,8 April 2010
Taken," Why Liam Neeson Is One Of Our Finest Actors Today
","Liam Neeson has certainly taken on his share of commanding & varied roles in films,from supporting (check out his work on 'The Bounty')to his lead work in 'Michael Collins'. 'Taken',a film with a script co-written with Luc Besson is another shining example. Ironically,'Taken' (a French/United States co-production)is a film that fared far better in Europe than it has done over here (and also sadly). Neeson is a retired mercenary,who is taking some pretty crappy end of the stick,under the table jobs (security work for a trendy pop star,patterned obviously after Brittney Spears,minus the attitude,for example). His life is thrown into a quandary when his 17 year old daughter is kidnapped in Paris by a crime syndicate from eastern Europe,who captures attractive young women tourists,drugged & forced into prostitution. Our hero takes the first flight to France & opens up a can of whup ass on the baddies. Does he find his darling daughter? This is a high caliber,suspenseful thriller that will have you glued to your seat. There is talk that the European cut of this film is a bit longer than the one being distributed in the U.S.(perhaps when it finds release on DVD,the extra few minutes will be included). Despite the fact that this film carries a PG-13 rating by the goons at the MPAA,it has some salty language,lurid sexual & drug references,and a high body county,due to some fairly graphic violence that would have landed it an 'R',some years back (perhaps the American distributors slipped a nice,thick package of money under the door at the MPAA to buy themselves the PG-13 rating",9,0,0,5 May 2009
Up," Chalk Up Another Winner For Pixar
","Since Pixar produced their first 3D-CGI (three dimension,computer generated image)short,an untitled experimental short of dinosaurs running across a vast field, they have managed to carve a niche in animated features (as well as some mighty funny & very well animated short films,as well). Now, Pixar proudly brings us, 'Up'. 'Up' is a tale of a young boy,named Carl Fredricksen,who just wants to follow in the footsteps of his hero,adventurer, Charles Muntz,and travel to South America to find a hidden waterfall paradise. The ensuing years manage to side track Carl's dreams (in a wordless montage that will go for the heart strings). Carl is now an old man (voiced by veteran actor,Ed Asner),who's home is scheduled to be demolished to make room for apartments,and seems doomed to spend the rest of his life in a nursing home when he has the idea to tie thousands of helium filled balloons & float away. Unbenownst to Carl,a young boy scout,Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai)stows away on his porch. Carl has no other choice but to bring Russell along. What follows is a series of adventures for Carl,Russell,and a dog named Dug (voiced by co writer, co director,Bob Peterson)to South America,where they manage to find not just Carl's boyhood hero,Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer),but an ultra rare bird,which Russell takes a fancy to (and vice versa). Bob Peterson co writes & directs,with Pete Docter (who also provides some voice overs for a character named Campmaster Strauch),from a story by Peterson,Docter & Thomas McCarthy. The film has some impressive cinematography & editing. What I really admired was the fact that,despite a Disney production,doesn't have the usual sappy Disney-esquire songs that only manage to pad the film out. I eagerly await Pixar's next entry. Available in certain areas in Digital Disney 3D,and standard 2D for cinemas that are not equipped for 3D screenings. Rated PG by the MPAA,this film serves up some scary moments that small tykes may find a bit intense.",10,1,3,4 September 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Suspension Of Disblief ,A Pre Requisite
","As most school children know,the Vikings were originally from Scotland, and spoke fluent English,with a dense Scottish accent. That bit of beefing aside,'How To Train Your Dragon' is a fun time at the cinema. The plot:Hiccup is a young Viking lad who wants to hunt & kill a dragon, just like his brave Father,Stoick. Problem is that Hiccup is something of a screw up who just can't get things straight. One day when the village is being attacked by a horde of dragons,Hiccup manages to land one with a crude sling shot like device. When Hiccup goes to claim his prize (and try,one and for all to impress his dad),he finds out that dragons aren't as evil as they are made out to be. This causes Hiccup to do a radical re-think of dragons & study their movements. In the interim of all of this,Hiccup manages to form a bond of friendship with the dragon (which he even assigns a name:Toothless),all the while he is in training on how to kill a dragon with the other youngsters in the village (under Gobber's tutorial). It's now up to Hiccup to try & go on a one man (boy?)campaign to change the Viking's anti dragon bias. Dean DeBlois (Lilo & Stitch,Heima)& Chris Sanders (also Lilo & Stitch,both the feature film,as well as the television series)co direct,from a screenplay by DeBlois,from the best selling novel by Cressida Cowell. As this is an animated 3D-CGI feature film (released in both digital 3-D,standard 3-D,as well as flat 2-D formats),the voice talent include Jay Baruchel as Hiccup,Gerard Butler ('Rocknrolla','300',and most recently in 'The Bounty Hunter')as Hiccup's father,Stoick,Craig Ferguson ('The Late,Late Show With Craig Ferguson')as Stoick's best friend,Gobber,America Ferrera ('Ugly Betty') as Astrid,Hiccup's adversary,with Jonah Hill,T.J.Miller,Kristen Wiig, Kieron Elliot & Ashley Jensen. This is fast moving fun for one & all. Rated PG by the MPAA,for some intense sequences that may frighten the very young & a bit of rude humour.",9,1,2,11 April 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Strap Yourselves In Tight (it's gonna be a rough ride)
","If you think that any & all of the recent wave of torture porn films even remotely began with Saw,guess again. In 1975,Pier Paulo Pasolini undertook his last film project,based loosely on a novel by the Marquis De Sade (Pasolini would meet with a tragic death later that year in 1975,during a ill chosen homosexual pick up,where Pasolini was found dead in his car,with his throat slashed,several miles from the pick up spot, at a petrol station/rest stop),The 20 Days,that told tale of a band of degenerates that brings a cadre of young people to a castle & eventually demean and torture to death. 'Salo,Or The 120 Days Of The Sodom' is the result of that book. A group of Communist young people (boys & girls)are arrested by the Fascists,brought to a posh country home & for the next four months,are subjected to some of the most dehumanizing realms of debauchery,torture & eventually are murdered by the Fascists,one by one. This is not...repeat,NOT an easy film to watch (Screw publisher, Al Goldstein walked out of a screening in sheer disgust). The film is populated by a top notch cast of Italian non professionals (which Pasolini was fond of working with). The photography is lush & makes good use of the environment it was filmed in. Undertake at your own risk. Spoken in Italian with English subtitles. Originally rated 'X' by the MPAA,this film serves up some truly nasty scenes of torture,graphic violence,full frontal male & female nudity & graphic sexuality,both heterosexual as well as gay.",8,2,4,12 July 2009
Departures," Transcending To The Last Level
","In Yojiro Takita's heartfelt film,'Okuribito' (released in the U.S. & other English speaking countries as 'Departures'),Daigo Kobayshi is a cellist with a symphony orchestra that mainly plays to sparse audiences. When the owner of the orchestra drops the bombshell that he is disbanding the orchestra, Daigo sells his cello, and with his beloved wife,moves back to the house he grew up in. Seeking employment,he answers an advertisement proclaiming departures, figuring it's some kind of travel agent. When he discovers that,due to a print error in the newspaper that the job is preparing the dearly departed for the undertaker,he balks at the idea,but eventually warms up to the job. Daigo also begins to ponder the fine line between life and death & the relationship with his own parents (he lost his mother while on tour with the orchestra,and his father abandoned both Daigo & his mother when Daigo was only 8). This loving meditation on life and death is directed by Yojiro Takita,with a well written screen play by Kundo Koyama that blends drama,pathos & dark humour to put across the point. Masahiro Motoki plays Daigo,in a winning performance of a man coming to terms with life & death. Royoko Hirosue is his wife,Mika, who just beams charisma with every scene she plays in. Throw in some crisp photography and editing,and an enlightening evening of fine Japanese cinema is in store. Spoken in Japanese with English subtitles. Rated PG-13 by the MPAA for mature subject matter,and a bit of naughty language.",10,0,2,28 July 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," What The (curse) !
","When I found out that Wes Anderson had a new film in the can ready for release some months back,I was jumping for joy (I've been a fan of Anderson's work for some years now,which includes 'Rushmore','The Royal Tennenbaums,and 'The Darjeeling Limited',and others). When I found out further that it was to be an animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's book,'The Fantastic Mr.Fox',I was doing cerebral back flips. Wes Anderson directs a screen play written by Anderson & Noah Baumbach (The Squid & The Whale),based on the book by Roald Dahl (Charlie & The Chocolate Factory,James & The Giant Peach,etc.). The story concerns the afore mentioned Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney),who finds out from his life partner ,Mrs.Fox (Meryl Streep,last seen in 'Julie & Julia',and currently in 'It's Complicated') that she's expecting a fox pup,in a farmer's steel trap & promises if they get out,he would renounce his evil ways & make a nice life for both of them. Problem is,some years later,he gets the old itch to go out & kill chickens & steal food. In the tradition of the 'Oceans' series,he schemes one more heist from the local farmers. Problem is,one heist turns into another & another,until things get out of control. Besides George Clooney & Meryl Streep,the likes of Anderson regular,Jason Schwartzman,Bill Murray,Owen Wilson,as well as the likes of Michael Gambon,Willem Dafoe, & even Wes Anderson,himself, lend their voices to this fun little film that despite the wave of 3D-CGI animation,instead settles for old school stop motion animation (the same kind of animation used for Gumby,Wallace & Gromit,and others),which,although not the best stop motion animation I've seen,is still worth seeking out. Rated PG by the MPAA,this film serves up some occasionally harrowing action scenes,some suggested rude talk (the characters substitute the word 'curse' for the real thing),and a bit of smoking & drinking by the humans in the story.",9,1,4,3 January 2010
Moon," Who Begat Who/What Begat What?
","With the 40th anniversary of the U.S. Moon landing looming,the time is right for this nicely written & directed film on a what seems like a future Moon mission. Astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell)has been on the Moon for the last three years,harvesting materials to be sent back to Earth for renewable energy. Sam is long overdue to return to Earth, missing his wife & young daughter. Sam starts to experience nagging headaches,persistent hallucinations & worsening health. The fact that he's seen a younger version of himself only manages to make things worse (space fever,loneliness,etc.?). Kevin Spacey adds his voice to all of this as the voice of the on board computer,GERTY (an evil spawn of HAL?),who seems to know what's best for Sam. Duncan Jones (son of David & Angela Bowie)directs a mighty fine tale of space madness & evil corporate goings on that will keep you guessing. Rated 'R' by the MPAA for raunchy language,some violence & the unpleasant effects of space madness. Probably advisable to keep the young ones home.",9,1,2,19 July 2009
The Runaways," Sex And Drugs And Rock & Roll
","...And more sex,drugs & rock & roll,and even more sex,drugs & rock & roll. If you haven't quite figured it out yet,this is the tale of the rise & fall of the 1970's pre-Glam (glamour-a sort of post glitter rock genre) rock band,The Runaways. In 1975,Kim Fowley,who is/was something of an icon on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood,who was associated with the likes of Frank Zappa & the original Mothers Of Invention,Jonathan Richman,to mention but a few, discovered a then,unknown guitar player named Joan Jett,who wanted to rock out in a big way & helped form The Runaways,and made them a success. 'The Runaways' attempts to tell their story of the road to success,and it's hard falling down. The Runaways lasted little more than four (or so) years,and recorded a few L.P's for Mercury,before burning out. Italy's own Floria Sigismondi,known for her work in music videos,directs from her screenplay,adapted from the novel 'Neon Angel' by Cherie Currie,based on her own life as 'rock & roll goddess'. Joan Jett acts as one of the executive producers. The cast includes Kristen Stewart,who moves up in a big way from her usual shtick in the Twilight series (another one is due sometime later this year,or next year),as Joan Jett. Dakota Fanning, looking dead eyed & myopic as Cherie Currie. Stella Maeve,as Sandy West. Scout Taylor-Compton,as Lita Ford,and Alia Shawkat,as Robin,as The Runaways. Michael Shannon is the very over the top,Kim Fowley,who is part Svengali,and part Frankenstein's monster as their manager,as well as some brief on screen time by Tatum O'Neal (yes,THE Tatum O'Neal, of 'Paper Moon'fame),as Cherie's mother. My two obvious gripes with this film is some of the historical goofs (I won't go into details,as not to spoil it for others,but musical historians will pick it up in the flick of an eye),and how the film mostly focuses on the working & personal relationship of Joan & Cherie (the rest of the Runaways seem to be little more than a backdrop most of the time). The biggest winner of this film (for me,anyway)is the music,which not only includes songs by The Runaways,but Iggy & The Stooges,David Bowie,as well as other period music of the era. For anybody born after 1985,who wonders 'what was the music of the '70's all about?',this film will give you a brief peek into an open window of that decade. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains strong language,and much reveling in the Rock & Roll lifestyle (sexual experimentation,including nudity,much alcohol & drug abuse...mainly by minors),much on screen smoking",8,3,10,11 April 2010
Up in the Air," Ice Water For Blood
","Ryan Bingham is a corporate ax man (that is to say,he has the thankless job of firing people for various bosses that lack the nerve to do it themselves). Ryan really enjoys his job, all because he is a heartless bastard with ice water for blood (as the above mentioned),as well as the high class perks that his job supplies him with (he spends most of his time in planes,flying from job to job--hence,the title). Ryan is also something of a 'user' of women,with no regard for settling down for a lifetime (he also has little use for his own family). Ryan seems to have it all down,pat. He is having a fling with a woman met on a connecting flight. He is also training a young novice in the wily ways of firing people,cold ('how do you sleep at night?',asks one of his victims). Does a humbling experience,involving family members cause a (paradigm)shift in his realm of thinking? George Clooney takes the part he was obviously born to play,in this smart & well written drama, with some nice touches of comedy to lighten things up. Vera Farmiga is Alex Goran,the woman he is carrying on with. Anna Kendrick is Natalie Keener,a young,up & coming ax person,who is learning the ropes from Ryan (but obviously doesn't like Ryan much as a person,'tho does respect his position on firing some genuinely hard working people). Jason Reitman (director of such toothsome film fare such as 'Thank You For Smoking' & Juno',and son of director,Ivan Reitman,who also acts as one of the executive producers of this film)directs & co-writes the screenplay with Sheldon Turner,in a film with a touch of savvy. Other cast members include Jason Bateman (who's obviously redeemed himself from appearing in such fare as 'Teen Wolf 2')plays Ryan's boss,Craig Gregory,and if you don't blink,you'll spot Sam Elliot (several notches up from the sorry mess he last appeared in ['Did You Hear About The Morgans?]),as an airline pilot,patterned after Capt.'Sully' Sullenberger,who saved the passengers & crew by crash landing that flight in the Hudson River last year. This is smart,savvy film making that makes for a well spent Saturday night at the movies. Rated 'R' by the MPAA for some outbursts of strong language,brief nudity & adult content",9,0,3,12 February 2010
