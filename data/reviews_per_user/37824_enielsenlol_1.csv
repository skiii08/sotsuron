It," Nothing short of amazing
","Words cannot truly express how much of a master piece this film really is. I knew this movie was going to be good going into it but I was blown away by how much more it exceeded my expectations and then some.I left the theater in shock, morbidly disturbed in a sense which has never really happened to me with a movie. I can't seem to shake how messed up this movie is and how they managed to capture the essence of creepiness. Hands down the best horror movie I have ever seen. They stuck to the elements that worked in the first adaptation in the 1990s and expanded from there creating a more intricate universe. I loved this movie and I'll definitely watch it again and again as a halloween tradition. I strongly recommend this movie!",10,6,15,9 September 2017
