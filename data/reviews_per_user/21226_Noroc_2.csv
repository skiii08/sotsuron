Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very entertaining movie. Lives up to the 'Star Wars' reputation.
","Forget the critics, I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was a lot of fun.  It had great action sequences, amazing special effects, and it set up the story very well.  True it had some cheezy parts, but so did the other three.  Definitely just as entertaining as the other three- and that's about the highest praise a movie can get.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
American Pie," A Porky's for the '90s.
","The summary pretty much says it all.  This is a hilarious movie about four adolescent seniors trying to get laid.  It's filled with so many gross gags and sex jokes that it makes 'Something About Mary' look like Barney's Big Adventure.  Not a movie to take your parents to, but one every guy has got to see.",9,0,0,7 July 1999
