Blade Runner 2049," Do machines have a Soul?
","Went to 1st screening on opening day, and three days later it is still hard to describe how amazed and blown-away this film left me... Blade Runner 2049 is simply, in one word: 'COOL!' Many visuals were so richly constructed, and reminded me of the breathtaking visuals of films I've seen many times before (Kubrick's '2001', and Tarovsky's 'Stalker - two other favorite films). Not as imitation, but likewise, as almost a separate character of the story. You can't do this kind of story-telling, visually, in a 90-120 minute film. So, to me, the length of the film was about perfect! One thought in my head, just as in the original Blade Runner, was that machines (non-organic life-forms, like the Replicants) may indeed have a 'Soul' (if humans indeed have one?) The other thought I had was that every life, whether organic or synthetic, is so unique and precious. This was the message that I got from the action/plot/story...Thought that all the cast was wonderful. As Harrison Ford's character came in at the late minutes of the movie, I can say that as 'K', Ryan Gosling carried his part and the main plot of the film very well! Am so ready to see this in the theater at least 2 more times... and buying the Blu-ray (with many extras - one hopes!)Simply a worthy and beautifully crafted sequel to the original classic! And I say this as along time fan of Ridley Scott's 1982 film, and of the novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) it was based on, by that long gone genius writer, Philip K. Dick.... Just go and SEE THIS MOVIE - SEE IT TODAY!!!",10,8,19,6 October 2017
Duck Soup," Non-stop Laughs!
","A high point in the films of the Marx Bros. Maybe their very best film ever... though 'A Night at the Opera' is a very close second place.... Yes, non-stop zaniness and a bare plot of a story, but does that even matter, when you can LYAO just watching this rare gem, any day of the week?! Laughter is medicine, and the Marx Bros. all deserve an honorary PhD. for their comedy antics! God Bless the Clowns! God Bless mother Marx for giving birth to these geniuses of Comedy.... the best ambassadors that America could ever gift to all the world! Maybe if every country shared their comedy with every other country, we would understand each other a bit better? That's my plan for World Peace!",10,4,5,8 April 2018
The Lion King," A nice break from the Human world!
","I liked the original Lion King film. As a lover of all animals (esp. Cats!) I just had to see this new 2019 remake...
Like many have noted, the CGI here is so incredibly life-like. I also found it amazing and breathlessly beautiful. Some say this remake has no feeling, but the film was such that it moved me to tears of joy! I have to see this again soon, and will await the Blu-ray disc (by Christmas?!) Honestly, I didn't have any real nitpicks... It was just a fun and lovely break from the daily 'rat-race' of life in the human world of today... Nuff said!",9,2,7,3 August 2019
1917," Amazing War Film... Amazing Filmmaking!
","Until today, my favorite war film of all was 'Das Boot'. Now it is my favorite war film about WW-2, because a few hours ago, I watched what, IMHO, is the best war film ever made. And also a masterpiece of modern filmmaking, by director Sam Mendes.On Oscar Sunday, I took my father, a Navy Viet Nam era Veteran, to see '1917'.
We both were blown away by this film. The actors, the cinematography, the way the camera never left the main characters... the realism of the sudden shocks, uncertainty, and horrors of war... not just WW-1, but of all wars, in all eras. 'War is Hell' someone once said, and this film proved the point to me.If you like a gripping war or action type film, if you are a film student or budding filmmaker, love historical & period films, or just enjoy a great story... there is all of that and more in '1917'.",10,10,15,10 February 2020
Garden State," I absolutely loved this movie!
","Movie trailers rarely prepare you for what a film really 'feels' like, and that was the case for me with Zach Braff's mini-gem, 'Garden State'. Also, comparing it to another film (Lost In Translation) is quite misleading too. Honestly, it was the eclectic soundtrack, and the chance to see Miss Portman in something other than Star Wars, was what drove me to go see this movie.The film starts off very somber and slowly (the main character, Andrew Largeman, portrayed by Zach Braff, returns home after his mother's death), but it picks up by turns and events. The biggest of these is the later introduction of Natalie Portman as Andrew's love interest, and for me illustrated perfectly the saying, 'For every ending, their is also a new beginning'. To not give too much info away here, I just want to say that the film is a great story of one young man's personal odyssey in coming to grips with his own life, and on his own terms. And that this film has everything I look for -- a good, entertaining story; interesting people and situations; some laughs; some tears; some 'brain food' to munch on for later. In short, this movie touched on every emotion and neuron in me. THANK-YOU, ZACH!",8,0,0,12 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Of all the Star Wars films, since the OT...
","Am seriously dumbfounded... Not by the newest Star Wars film, but by the number of people that dislike or hate it. Go figure... 
Maybe I am a more 'casual' fan, light-years from the cosplay, buy-every-action-figure, comic book, and read every SW novel type of Super Fan... But I am a '1st Fan', having seen each SW film since the very first one premiered way, way back in May of 1977. I loved the first movie so much, a high school chum and I even hid out in the theater restroom, right after seeing 'Star Wars', just so we could see the next screening right away... yup! Oh, what memories...
Now, am only going here on my one and only viewing, so far, of The Last Jedi, but I enjoyed it... A lot... In just one word, after it ended, I could only say was: 'Whoa!'
Yes, oh yes, there is a lot in this film that came almost out of nowhere, or maybe from some wormhole in the screenwriters deep-dark imagination... Like the burning of the Jedi Texts (hey, I love old books, so the burning of ANY books, especially ones with mystical/spiritual and other esoteric type of knowledge, just rubs me wrong!). And the part of Leia 'Force-Flying' (?) back to the rebel command ship soon after being blown out into space... well, that was more unexpected stuff, but hey, she is a Skywalker after all, and the other half of Yoda & Obi-Wan's 'Last Hope' (Episode 6, ROTJ). Mostly, I just took all this and more into stride, and simply just watched what was a very cool, action-packed, fantasy/science fiction-filled adventure... I had gone in hoping the movie would be good, but not expecting any certain things to happen, or not happen, in the story or on screen. Just watched SW:TLJ with an open mind & heart, and had a great time... And, I found so much to like in it, like the many new aliens & creatures, vehicles, etc. Basically, it was just a 'Fun Time At The Movies', which was all I really wanted... I got that & more! And so, for now, like Stan Lee says: 'Nuff said!' (...and May the Force be with You!)",10,5,18,6 January 2018
The Shape of Water," A magical fairy tale movie!
","Am watching the Blu-ray of 'The Shape of Water'. It is a modern fairy tale, a romance story, a period piece (early 1960's), a tribute to old films & TV, and simply a very beautiful and well crafted, visual & fantasy film.
This film is a joy and was the best thing to redeem a very tough year (2017). 
No spoilers this review... Only can say that if you missed it in the theater, watch this on DVD, Blu-ray or streaming... soon! And I hope you see & feel the magic!
Director Del Toro has worked a miracle yet again... Muchas Gracias, Maestro!",10,34,62,9 January 2018
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," We all have a secret 'inner life'?
","I did not see this back when it was in theaters.... I finally watched 'Birdman' for the 1st time just last week. And good I waited.
Think I appreciate the story and the main character, played expertly by Michael Keaton, now, as I can relate to the struggles he was going through. I'm not an actor, and have no allusions to 'Fame', even the 15-minute variety that artist Andy Warhol once spoke of... But, being a near senior citizen, the trials and tribulations of anyone that is over 'a certain age' is something that I, and anyone in that era of life, that also likes a thoughtful AND entertaining story/film, surely can relate to....
We might all not have an 'inner voice' that insults us, and eggs us on to 'Do Better' (while said voice appears, now and then, visibly - and, wearing a super hero suit), but we are fallible, sometimes (often) ego-driven creatures.... and simply just want to know we are loved (lovable?) and appreciated - as we go faster and faster through this often hectic, and at times crazy & stressful existence, on this tiny speck floating in an immense and indifferent universe!
This film is both fascinating and a bit perplexing, so I will have to watch it a second and third time... very soon. But, if you like watching odd & unusual types of films: one that has humor, occasional fantasy & action, and social commentary - and especially, if you enjoy the underrated and excellent acting of Mr. Michael Keaton - then 'Birdman' just might be the film for you? Enjoy!",9,1,1,5 May 2018
Annihilation," Amazing & Thoughtful Sci-Fi Adventure!
","A very engaging plot/story... a 'Thinking Person' type of fiction/horror film.
And so very beautiful - visually. The effects, set designs, scenery, many colors, and especially the very dreamy quality of light throughout (good job, Cinematographer!) And congrats on some great work, Director!A truly mind-blowing and very philosophical type of Science Fiction film - much like '2001' was in its heyday (now 50 short years ago). And the ending is extremely powerful and effective... All the cast are fantastic! My hats off to Ms. Portman, as she really pulled it off, the whole film through, of her character's past and present job/life experiences. This could be her very best work yet?!This film is one that you should go in knowing as little as you can. I did, and it made the experience all the better, as we all can see a film 'for the first time'... just once. But you should see this in a movie theater, or at home with a good surround type speaker system... the sounds (and music) are so amazing! Almost gave this film 10 stars... because I had dearly hoped for a much different ending (I have not read the book this is based on, but I plan to). Lastly, I highly recommend, to anyone that hasn't, go watch the 1979 Russian science fiction film 'Stalker'. A film that Steven Spielberg is said to love. Cheers!",9,1,3,26 March 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," Of cats & chords... bums & strums!
","You don't have to be a musician to enjoy this film, but I am and it hit me hard!
For every Bob Dylan, or Elvis, or Beatles, or Britney Spears and Taylor Swift, etc. there are many hundreds/thousands of 'hopefuls'. This is the story of one...The music is just a part, but it is excellent, and Oscar Isaac plays & sings very well. He showed his real depth as an actor (and musician too!) The film is set in 1961 and was like watching the world of New York, etc., thru a time-machine lens... Oh, God Bless! the Coen Brothers for making films like this that touch the Heart and Funny Bone. To me they are National Treasures and have my deepest admiration and gratitude. Good Work, Boys!!!The main title character, played excellently by Oscar Isaac, is quite pathetic at times, but has a real passion for his 'Life's Work' of writing and playing folk songs. But how he treats his friends, others and himself (and cats), says more than his music ever does. He is really the 'walking wounded' ever since his singing partner had died by suicide. He appears to just muddle forward in life?
It seemed to me that he lived up to that expression of 'Being one's own worst enemy', as he insults or says mean things to all those who try to help him, or those that care and have been closest to him, or even made love to him (Jean).The scene where he played a song to his father (who has dementia, and does not talk?) was very moving, and will hit anyone that has an old parent or known someone with a similar situation. And the plotline about the orange cat really got to me, as a cat lover. When Llewyn abandons the old man (John Goodman) and the orange cat in the car by the side of the road, it was a heart-rending scene, and what happened later when he encounters that cat again on the road. Why does he not help others more? Maybe he feels he is of no use, except for his music. And at the end, he seems to abandon any hope for that as well?As a struggling songwriter/musician myself, this film really connected with me.
I watched it three times, after getting the DVD, and will watch it quite often... This is a very rich story, of a time in America that had it's own unique magic, when the Space Race had just begun, and JFK was still alive (and the American Dream too!) And it's a film to make you root for an anti-social but likeable anti-hero. For Llewyn isn't really a bum with a guitar, nor is he much different than any of us... He just needs to care a bit more about others & himself... and cats!",9,2,2,10 January 2020
