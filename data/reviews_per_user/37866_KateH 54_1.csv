Casablanca," (sigh)
","Casablanca is a film I have seen many, many times.  I have gone through many separate times of being besotted with the film.  A few months ago, I took two of my best friends to see a new print in London - they had never seen it.  Conscious of them during the movie, I realized how many lines from Casablanca are almost cliched now; they are so famous.  But this does not distract.  Casablanca is one of the few films that lives up entirely to its reputation.  Perfect.",10,1,1,15 February 1999
