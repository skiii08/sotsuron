The Ring," Well done remake
","I went to see this film expecting to be disappointed, considering the low quality of horror films lately. The Ring is well made, and decently acted, but like The Cell, the 'look' of the film is what is most appealing.After seeing it I saw the original Japanese film from 1998. The Japanese version (Ringu) told a similar story but without some of the touches Gore Verbinski used to appeal to Western audiences. Ringu was much more subtle about revealing the secrets of the tape while Ring is a little more blatant about some things, like the 'seven days' revelation near the end. I thought it was a very disturbing and original film. The people who think The Ring is stealing ideas from Feardotcom or some PS2 game obviously don't realize where the concept started.",10,0,0,27 October 2002
