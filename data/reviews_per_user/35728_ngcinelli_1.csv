First Man," In depth
","This film seemed to be a lot more in depth with Neil Armstrongs life up to the Apollo 11 mission which to me was a great way to go. The 'First Man' was supposed to be about the Man himself, is what I took from this film and was glad to see it in detail. I love space exploration films and hope to continue to see more. Thanks for the Sunday afternoon thrill flick ðŸ˜Š",8,0,1,24 October 2018
