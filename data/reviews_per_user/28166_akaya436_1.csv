Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Great combination of cartoon and murder mystery
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit, is a movie that took two different forms of media and entertainment and combined them together to create a seemingly new form of visual enjoyment. Roger, a suspicious cartoon rabbit is looking to find out the truth about his wife; when he employs Eddie Valiant, a detective, to get the skinny on what his wife is doing, and he finds himself in more trouble than ever expected. Before the investigation into his wife can take place, Roger becomes the prime suspect in the murder of Mr. Acme. The movie shows the trials and obstacles that Roger and Valiant have to overcome while trying to prove Roger's innocence. The theme of the movie is proving innocence. Roger may not like Mr. Acme for his involvement with his wife, but he is not the murdering type. The movie shows the theme throughout with the ongoing quest to prove Roger's innocence. The lighting adds to the mystery and secretive atmosphere of the film. There are many scenes that use low lighting and spotlighting under street lamps to give a very mysterious feel. This is one aspect that helps to tie the film together with the typical/classic detective movie. The angles in the film also help to show the importance of finding innocence for Roger. There are tight angles that help depict the secretive aspect of the film, while there are wide angles, especially during transitions into new scenes of the film. The title of this film does a great job of giving a first time viewer a snap shot of the theme and what to expect. The film title asks the question Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and the whole movie is the hunt for who framed him and finding his innocence. Even though Valiant starts the movie hating tunes, he is able to avenge his brother's death; by the end of the movie he has a turnaround about his hatred for tunes and there is a warm and fuzzy feeling that all is well with the world. This is a great movie that combines two classic movie genres and gives the viewer/audience the ability to experience something brand new. A movie that is similar to Who Framed Roger Rabbit is Gnomeo and Juliette. They share the theme of proving innocence; both of the main characters are trying to show they have not done anything wrong.",6,1,1,4 August 2013
